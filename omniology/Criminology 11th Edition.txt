and mental traits that make them crime 
prone. These traits are inherited and are 
present at birth. Mental and physical

Stock Montage, Inc.
ORIGIN  About 1930
FOUNDERS  Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck
MOST IMPORTANT WORKS  Sheldon and Eleanor 
Glueck: Five Hundred Delinquent Women 
(1934); Later Criminal Careers (1937); 
Criminal Careers in Retrospect (1943); 
Juvenile Delinquents Grown Up (1940); 
Unraveling Juvenile Delinquency (1950)
CORE IDEAS  Crime is a function of 
environmental, socialization, physical, 
and psychological factors. Each makes an 
independent contribution to shaping and 
directing behavior patterns. Defi cits in these 
areas of human development increase the 
risk of crime. People at risk for crime can 
resist antisocial behaviors if these traits and 
conditions can be strengthened.
MODERN OUTGROWTHS  Developmental Theory, 
Life Course Theory, Latent Trait Theory
MULTIFACTOR/INTEGRATED THEORY
ORIGIN   1897
FOUNDERS   Émile Durkheim, Robert Ezra 
Park, Ernest Burgess, Clifford Shaw, Walter 
Reckless, Frederic Thrasher
MOST IMPORTANT WORKS   Durkheim, The Division 
of Labor in Society (1893), and Suicide: 
A Study in  Sociology (1897); Park, Burgess, 
and John McKenzie, The City (1925); Thrasher, 
The Gang (1926); Shaw et al., Delinquency 
Areas (1925); Edwin Sutherland, Criminology 
(1924)
CORE IDEAS   A person’s place in the social 
structure determines his or her behavior. 
Disorganized urban areas are the breeding 
ground of crime. A lack of legitimate 
opportunities produces criminal subcultures. 
Socialization within the family, the school, 
and the peer group controls behavior.
MODERN OUTGROWTHS   Strain Theory, Cultural 
Deviance Theory, Social Learning Theory, 
Social Control Theory, Social Reaction 
Theory, Labeling
SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY

Learning Objectives
Cengage Learning Test Banks for Criminal Justice
Cengage Learning recognizes the challenges of teaching and 
seeks to support faculty in their efforts to educate students. 
In pursuit of this goal, we have included an additional section 
in your Instructor’s Manual to help new instructors maximize 
the beneﬁ ts of using our unique integrated learning objectives program. Each textbook chapter begins with 8–12 numbered 
learning objectives that have been carefully matched to individual bullet points in the end-of-chapter summary. And many 
texts include marginal notes to identify exactly where in the text each of these learning objectives is covered—making student 
review more productive than ever. Finally, each item in the accompanying Test Bank, Companion Website quiz, Study Guide, 
PowerPoints, etc., is linked to a particular learning objective (“LO1,” “LO5,” etc.) in each chapter. Taken together, all these 
provide unparalleled learning reinforcement and assessment.
How do learning objectives make teaching easier and more effective?
Chapter-by-chapter learning objectives can be the organizing framework for all of the information taught in class. Rely on them 
to isolate each chapter’s most critical concepts and to serve as the basis for your lecture outlines AND your tests. We help 
you do just this by using the learning objectives as the foundation for all of the support items we provide. Text, lecture, and 
assessment all work together seamlessly when you use our integrated learning objectives program for Criminal Justice! 
How do learning objectives make learning easier and more effective?
Students who know what is expected of them are more likely to succeed. Learning objectives let the students know exactly 
what you expect them to learn, while various tutorials available in our products and on our companion websites show them how 
to achieve the learning objectives. By having students focus on what’s most important in every chapter and reinforcing mastery 
of that material at every turn, Cengage Learning’s Criminal Justice textbooks work with you to promote student success.

About the Author
LARRY J. SIEGEL was born in the Bronx in 1947. While living on Jerome 
 Avenue and attending City College of New York in the 1960s, he was swept up in 
the social and political currents of the time. He became intrigued with the infl u-
ence contemporary culture had on individual behavior: Did people shape society 
or did society shape people? He applied his interest in social forces and human 
behavior to the study of crime and justice. After graduating CCNY, he attended 
the newly opened program in criminal justice at the State University of New York 
at Albany, earning both his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees there. After completing his 
graduate work, Dr. Siegel began his teaching career at Northeastern University, 
where he was a faculty member for nine years. After leaving Northeastern, he held 
teaching positions at the University of Nebraska–Omaha and Saint Anselm Col-
lege in New Hampshire. He is currently a professor at the University of Massachu-
setts–Lowell. Dr. Siegel has written extensively in the area of crime and justice, 
including books on juvenile law, delinquency, criminology, criminal justice, and 
criminal procedure. He is a court certifi ed expert on police conduct and has testi-
fi ed in numerous legal cases. The father of four and grandfather of three, Larry 
Siegel and his wife, Terry, now reside in Bedford, New Hampshire, with their two 
dogs, Watson and Cody.
The author with his wife, Therese, in Italy.

Preface

N
None of us will ever forget the events of January 8, 2011, 
when Jared Lee Loughner, 22, opened fi re in a supermarket 
parking lot in Tucson, Arizona, in an attempt to kill Con-
gresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Nineteen people were shot, 
six of them fatally, including Gabe Zimmerman, an aide 
to Giffords, John Roll, a federal judge, and perhaps most 
tragically, 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, who had been 
brought to the meeting by neighbor Susan Hileman. Investi-
gations quickly found that Loughner was a deeply disturbed 
person with a long history of bizarre behavior. There was 
little question that he suffered from some psychological de-
fect that must have produced violent fantasies. Yet, searches 
of his possessions produced documents that suggested he 
had carefully planned the attack, indicating a rational and 
calculating mind.
The fallout from the shooting was immediate. Some 
commentators claimed that Loughner’s action was the tragic 
outcome of poisonous political rhetoric that had gripped the 
nation with vague references to violence. Some went as far 
as blaming presidential hopeful Sarah Palin for publishing a 
map with political opponents (including Giffords) targeted 
with gun sights. Others suggested that Loughner’s violent 
outburst was the product of his disturbed mind and had 
little connection to political rhetoric.
Criminologists devote their careers to understanding 
human nature, both good and bad. They ask this funda-
mental question: why do people behave the way they do? 
What truly motivates someone like Jared Loughner to go on 
a murderous rampage? He was not the product of poverty or 
a disorganized neighborhood. He was not a gang kid from a 
rough neighborhood; instead, he grew up in a middle-class 
area, had friends and a Facebook page, and attended col-
lege. How can his behavior be explained? If it was solely the 
product of a disturbed mind, what psychological or mental 
factors could have produced his murderous rage?
The attempt to kill Gabrielle Giffords also focused at-
tention on a number of important social and legal issues. 
How is it possible for a disturbed individual such as Lough-
ner to obtain a semi-automatic weapon and buy ammuni-
tion at the local Walmart? Should the possession of guns 
be more tightly controlled? Certainly this is a hot political 
issue. And what about the nation’s mental health system? 
Shouldn’t Loughner’s potential for violence have been diag-
nosed sooner and steps taken before tragedy occurred? His 
behavior also raises a fundamental legal issue: can a person 
as disturbed as Loughner be considered “legally sane” and 
sentenced to death? While there is a distinction between 
mental illness and legal insanity, did Loughner’s own words 
describing intent and planning condemn him before the law, 
despite his obvious psychological problems?
The general public is greatly concerned by acts such 
as the Tucson attack. I share their concern. For the past 
40 years, I have been able to channel my personal interest 
into a career as a teacher of criminology. My goal in writ-
ing this text is to help students generate the same curiosity 
about issues of crime and justice. What could be more im-
portant or fascinating than a fi eld of study that deals with 
such wide-ranging topics as the effects of violent media on 
young people, drug abuse, and organized crime? Criminol-
ogy is a dynamic fi eld, changing constantly with the release 
of major research studies, Supreme Court rulings, and gov-
ernment policy. Its dynamism and diversity make it an im-
portant and engrossing area of study.
Because interest in crime and justice is so great and so 
timely, this text is designed to review these ongoing issues 
and cover the fi eld of criminology in an organized and com-
prehensive manner. It is meant as a broad overview of the 
field, intended to whet the reader’s appetite and encour-
age further and more in-depth exploration. Several major 
themes recur throughout the book.
Competing Viewpoints:
 
■
 In every chapter, an effort is 
made to introduce students to the diversity of thought 
that characterizes this academic discipline. One reason 
that the study of criminology is so important is that

xviii  PREFACE
Enterprise boxes review important research in criminol-
ogy. For example in Chapter 2, a box called “Factors 
that Infl uence Crime Trends” discusses research that 
helps explain why crime rates rise and fall.
Social Policy: 
 
■
There is a focus on social policy 
throughout the book so that students can see how 
criminological theory has been translated into crime 
prevention programs. Because of this theme, Policy and 
Practice in Criminology boxes are included through-
out the text. These show how criminological ideas 
and research can be put into action. For example, in 
Chapter 10, there is a Policy and Practice in Criminol-
ogy feature called “Should Guns Be Controlled?” which 
deals with the association between guns and crime, a 
topic that has stirred debate over the control and sale 
of handguns.
In sum, the primary goals in writing this text are as 
follows:
1.  To provide students with a thorough knowledge of crim-
inology and show its diversity and intellectual content.
2. To be as thorough and up to date as possible.
3. To be objective and unbiased.
4.  To describe current theories, crime types, and meth-
ods of social control, and analyze their strengths and 
weaknesses.
5.  To show how criminological thought has infl uenced so-
cial policy.
TOPIC AREAS
The 11th edition has been thoroughly revised and updated. 
Chapter 13 has been retitled Enterprise Crime: White-
Collar and Green-Collar Crime and now includes exten-
sive coverage of green crimes, ranging from illegal fi shing to 
environmental pollution and dumping. Similarly, there is a 
new chapter (15) entitled Crimes of the New Millennium: 
Cybercrime and Transnational Organized Crime, which 
covers these newly emerging areas of criminality made pos-
sible by the Internet and instant communication. Crime is 
going global and so too is criminology.
The text is divided into four main sections or topic 
areas.
Part One provides a framework for studying criminol-
ogy. The fi rst chapter defi nes the fi eld and discusses its most 
basic concepts: the defi nition of crime, the component areas 
of criminology, the concept of criminal law, and the ethical 
issues that confront the fi eld. Chapter 2 covers criminologi-
cal research methods, and the nature, extent, and patterns 
of crime. Chapter 3 is devoted to the concept of victimiza-
tion, including the nature of victims, theories of victimiza-
tion, and programs designed to help crime victims.
debates continue over the nature and extent of crime 
and the causes and prevention of criminality. Some ex-
perts view criminal offenders as society’s victims, unfor-
tunate people who are forced to violate the law because 
they lack hope for legitimate opportunity; criminals are 
a “product of their environment.” Others view antisocial 
behavior as a product of mental and physical abnor-
malities, present at birth or soon after, which are stable 
over the life course; is it possible that criminals are 
“born and not made”? Still another view is that crime is 
a rational choice of greedy, selfi sh people who can only 
be deterred through the threat of harsh punishments; 
therefore, if “you do the crime, you do the time.” We 
will explore these and other views of crime causation. 
And to help students understand these competing view-
points, I have designed Concept Summary boxes that 
synthesize the main points and outlook of each theo-
retical model, along with its strengths and weaknesses.
Critical Thinking:
 
■
 It is important for students to think 
critically about law and justice and to develop a criti-
cal perspective toward the social institutions and legal 
institutions entrusted with crime control. Through-
out the book, students are asked to critique research 
highlighted in boxed material and to think outside the 
box. To aid in this task, each chapter contains a feature 
called “Thinking Like a Criminologist | An Ethical Di-
lemma,” which presents a scenario that can be analyzed 
with the help of material found in the chapter.
Diversity: 
 
■
Diversity is a key issue in criminology, and 
the text attempts to integrate issues of racial, ethnic, 
gender, and cultural diversity throughout. The book 
includes material on international issues, such as the 
use of the death penalty abroad, as well as gender issues 
such as the rising rate of female criminality. To help 
with the coverage of diversity issues, Race, Culture, 
Gender, and Criminology boxes cover diversity issues. 
In Chapter 18, for example, there is an in-depth dis-
cussion on how race infl uences sentencing in criminal 
courts.
Currency and Immediacy
 
■
: Throughout the book, ev-
ery attempt is made to use the most current research 
and to cover the most immediate topics. The idea is 
to show students the major trends in criminological 
research and justice policy. Most people who use the 
book have told me that this is one of its strongest fea-
tures. I have attempted to present current research in a 
balanced fashion, though this sometimes can be frus-
trating to students. For example, while some experts 
fi nd that biological traits and conditions promote crime, 
other criminologists conclude this research is spurious 
and that biology and crime are unrelated. Which posi-
tion is correct? While it is comforting to reach a defi nite 
conclusion about an important topic, sometimes that 
is simply not possible. In an effort to be objective and

a suspect in the case, is alleged to have killed another 
young girl. A Race, Culture, Gender, and Criminology 
feature, “Crime in Other Cultures,” has been updated. 
There is a new Policy and Practice in Criminology 
feature that asks, “Are Sex Offender Registration Laws 
Effective?” There is a Thinking Like a Criminologist 
| An Ethical Dilemma feature on Michael Vick, a star 
quarterback who was involved in a dog-fi ghting ring. A 
new section covers “The Law in Contemporary Society.” 
There is a Profi les in Crime feature entitled “Conspiracy 
Does Not Pay,” which delves into the story of three 
Philadelphia police offi cers who were indicted for their 
involvement in a drug conspiracy. Another new section, 
“Legalizing Marijuana,” reviews efforts to decriminalize 
cannabis.
Chapter 2 (The Nature and Extent of Crime)
 
■
 begins 
with the love triangle between George Zinkhan, Marie 
Bruce, and Thomas Tanner that led to murder. A Pro-
fi les in Crime feature called “A Pain in the Glass” covers 
the fraud committed by a couple who used the “waiter, 
there is glass in my food” ruse in restaurants and super-
markets stretching from Boston to Washington, D.C., 
to bilk them out of thousands of dollars. There is a 
new exhibit entitled “Why Do Victims Report Crime?” 
Data are presented from a recent study of more than 
a hundred retired New York Police Department cap-
tains and higher-ranking offi cers that found they were 
under intense pressure to reduce crime and may have 
manipulated crime statistics in order to show that their 
efforts were working. This chapter also covers a self-
report technique called the life event calendar (LEC). 
A Policy and Practice in Criminology box discusses 
the CATCH program (Crime Analysis Tactical Clearing 
House), which supports local law enforcement agencies 
in  analyzing crime series and patterns.
Chapter 3 (Victims and Victimization) 
 
■
highlights up-
dated victim data with the latest surveys. There is a new 
section on “vicarious fear”: even if people are not per-
sonally victimized, those who observe or are exposed 
to violence on a routine basis become fearful. There is a 
section on victimization in schools, which is shockingly 
common because schools unfortunately are populated 
by one of the most dangerous segments of society, teen-
age males. A Profi les in Crime box entitled “Online 
Predator” tells the story of Jonathan Wryn Vance, who 
used the Internet for interstate extortion. There is new 
material on lifestyle and victimization: people who 
belong to groups that have an extremely risky life—
homeless, runaways, drug users—are at high risk for 
victimization. The more time they are exposed to street 
life, the greater their risk of becoming crime victims. 
The Criminological Enterprise feature “Escalation or 
Desistance: The Effect of Victimization on Criminal 
Careers” looks at the issue of what happens when a 
criminal experiences victimization. There is a new sec-
tion on crisis intervention programs that refer victims to 
Part Two contains six chapters that cover criminologi-
cal theory: why do people behave the way they do? Why do 
they commit crimes? These views focus on choice (Chap-
ter 4), biological and psychological traits (Chapter 5), social 
structure and culture (Chapter 6), social process and social-
ization (Chapter 7), social confl ict and critical criminology 
(Chapter 8), and human development (Chapter 9).
Part Three is devoted to the major forms of criminal 
behavior. The chapters in this section cover violent crime 
(Chapter 10), political crime and terrorism (Chapter 11), 
common theft offenses (Chapter 12), enterprise crimes, in-
cluding white-collar and green-collar crimes (Chapter 13), 
public order crimes, including sex offenses and substance 
abuse (Chapter 14), and cybercrime and transnational orga-
nized crime (Chapter 15).
Part Four contains three chapters that cover the criminal 
justice system. The fi rst, Chapter 16, provides an overview 
of the entire justice system, including the process of justice, 
the major organizations that make up the justice system, and 
concepts and perspectives of justice. Chapter 17 focuses on 
the arrest and adjudication process. Chapter 18 delves into 
the topics of punishment and correction.
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
The 11th edition has been carefully structured to cover rel-
evant material in a comprehensive, balanced, and objective 
fashion. Every attempt has been made to make the presen-
tation of material interesting and contemporary. No single 
political or theoretical position dominates the text; instead, 
the many diverse views that are contained within criminol-
ogy and characterize its interdisciplinary nature are pre-
sented in an unbiased and even-handed fashion. While the 
text includes analysis of the most important scholarly works 
and scientifi c research reports, it also includes a great deal 
of topical information on recent cases and events, ranging 
from cyberscams to the violence of the Zeta gang, the “mus-
cle” formed to protect Mexican drug cartels.
WHAT IS NEW IN THIS 
EDITION
Chapter 1 (Crime and Criminology)

of Natalie Holloway, the 18-year-old girl from Birming-
ham, Alabama, who disappeared in 2005 and is alleged 
to have been murdered while on holiday on the island 
of Aruba. The reason: in 2010, Joran van der Sloot, long

xx  PREFACE
box entitled “Family Functioning and Crime,” which 
discusses the work of Rand Conger, one of the nation’s 
leading experts on family life. A Profi les in Crime fea-
ture called “But the Water Was Sterile!” discusses a case 
in which employees at a Texas-based oil company got 
fake fl u shots.
Chapter 8 (Social Confl ict, Critical Criminology, 
 
■
and Restorative Justice) now has an analysis of the 
Sri Lankan government’s civil rights abuse in its war 
against the Tamil Tiger rebel group. There is a sig-
nifi cant discussion of state (organized) crime—acts 
defi ned by law as criminal and committed by state of-
fi cials, both elected or appointed, in pursuit of their 
jobs as government representatives. A Criminological 
Enterprise box called “Mass Deception” covers Scott 
Bonn’s new book in which he argues that the George 
W. Bush administration manufactured public sup-
port for war on Iraq by falsely claiming that its leader 
Saddam Hussein was involved in the terrorist attacks of 
9/11 and that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruc-
tion. There is a section on illegal domestic surveillance 
and another on human rights violations. A new Profi les 
in Crime box on Russia’s death squads discusses how 
Russia crushed the separatist rebel groups in Chech-
nya, and a Policy and Practices in Criminology feature 
reviews the Victim Offender Reconciliation Program in 
Denver, Colorado.
Chapter 9 (Developmental Theories: Life Course, 
 
■
Latent Trait, and Trajectory) has been completely re-
organized and now includes an independent section on 
trajectory theory and the different pathways to crime. 
It begins with a vignette on the murder of Californians 
Thomas and Jackie Hawks by a group of criminals 
who decided to steal their yacht. There is a section on 
the foundations of developmental theory. A Profi les in 
Crime feature covers the Xbox murders. A Criminologi-
cal Enterprise box entitled “Love, Sex, Marriage, and 
Crime” reviews research by sociologists Bill McCarthy 
and Teresa Casey that examined the association between 
 romance and delinquency in a sample of teens.
Chapter 10 (Interpersonal Violence)
 
■
 begins with a 
new vignette on Dr. Amy Bishop, a Harvard-trained 
neurobiologist, who shot to death three of her col-
leagues and severely wounded three others when she 
was denied tenure. There is a section on social interac-
tion and violence based on the recent book Violence: A 
Micro-sociological Theory, by sociologist Randall Collins, 
who proposes a theory of violence that states that hu-
mans are inherently passive and violence is a function 
of social interaction. A Profi les in Crime box focuses on 
the Duke rape case. There is a new section on deliber-
ate indifference murder, where a person can also be 
held criminally liable for the death of another even if 
he or she did not intend to injure another person but 
exhibited deliberate indifference to the danger his or 
her actions might cause. A new Profi les in Crime feature 
specifi c services to help them recover from their ordeal. 
A Thinking Like a Criminologist | An Ethical Dilemma 
box covers “stand your ground laws.”
Chapter 4 (Rational Choice Theory)
 
■
 now covers the 
development and history of rational choice/classical 
theory, most closely identifi ed with the thoughts of Ital-
ian social philosopher Cesare Beccaria (1738–1794) 
and his famous treatise “On Crimes and Punishment.” A 
new section, “Why Crime?” looks at the question: when 
the consequences of crime can be painful, costly, and 
embarrassing, why do some people still choose to com-
mit crime? The Criminological Enterprise feature “Drug 
Dealer Retaliation” examines the rational way drug deal-
ers retaliate for perceived wrongdoing. A new Profi les in 
Crime feature, “Let Them Swim Home,” covers the case 
of Eugene Temkin, who tried to hire a hitman to kill his 
partner in a deal gone bad.
Chapter 5 (Trait Theories) 
 
■
now begins with the his-
tory and development of trait theories, including the 
work of Cesare Lombroso. A new exhibit describes the 
elements of the scientifi c method. There is a discussion 
of the dyslogic syndrome, as explained by psychologist 
Robert Rimland. A new section on smoking and drink-
ing shows how maternal alcohol abuse and/or smoking 
during gestation has long been linked to prenatal dam-
age and subsequent antisocial behavior in adolescence. 
Another section covers recent research studies that sug-
gest lead ingestion is linked to aggressive behaviors on 
both a macro- or group/nation level and on a micro- or 
individual case level. There is also a new section on at-
tachment theory, a view most closely associated with 
psychologist John Bowlby, who is connected to the 
 psychodynamic tradition.
Chapter 6 (Social Structure Theories) 
 
■
begins with a 
vignette on the MS-13 gang. A Profi les in Crime box, 
“MS-13 in Action,” shows why MS-13 is considered one 
of the most fearsome gangs in the United States. There 
are sections on the development of sociological crimi-
nology and how it replaced biological positivism as the 
main focus of criminology. There is an interesting new 
discussion on how social forces in disadvantaged areas 
may be so powerful that they overwhelm individual 
traits. New data on poverty are covered, including the 
newest trends in child poverty and minority group pov-
erty. A Race, Culture, Gender, and Criminology feature, 
“More than Just Race,” reviews the work of William Ju-
lius Wilson, one of the nation’s most prominent sociolo-
gists, including his new book, More than Just Race: Being 
Black and Poor in the Inner City. There is a new section 
on poverty concentration, a phenomenon that occurs 
when working- and middle-class families fl ee inner-city 
poverty areas, resulting in having the most disadvan-
taged population become consolidated in the most dis-
organized urban neighborhoods.
Chapter 7 (Social Process Theories: Socialization

PREFACE  xxi
to securities-related crimes. Half the chapter is now 
devoted to green crimes; sections include “Defi ning 
Green Crime” and “Enforcing Environmental Laws.” 
Green-collar crime can take many different forms, rang-
ing from deforestation to violations of worker safety. 
Among those discussed in the book are illegal logging, 
wildlife exports, fi shing, dumping, and polluting. A 
Profi les in Crime box, “Hunting the Shark Hunters,” 
tells how the African nation of Mozambique deals with 
illegal poachers.
Chapter 14 (Public Order Crime: Sex and Substance 
 
■
Abuse) opens with an updated vignette regarding the 
case of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, aka Client #9, 
who was caught paying thousands to a call girl ring. 
There is a new section on the gay marriage crusade, one 
of the most heated “moral crusades” of our time. A sec-
tion called “Virtual Kiddie Porn” shows how CGI and 
other high-tech innovations now make it possible for 
pornographers to create and distribute pornography us-
ing virtual images of children. A Profi les in Crime box 
called “Kiddie Porn?” discusses the case of Christopher 
Handley, who was accused of possessing sexually sug-
gestive comic books. Data on drug abuse and use have 
been updated.
Chapter 15 (Crimes of the New Millennium: 
 
■
 Cybercrime and Transnational Organized Crime) 
is a totally revised chapter. It begins with a new vi-
gnette on “Operation Phish Phry,” a government crack-
down on an international ring fraudulently collecting 
personal information from victims that was used to 
defraud fi nancial institutions by creating dummy ac-
counts or bogus credit cards. New sections cover the 
activities of contemporary transnational crime groups, 
including Eastern European gangs, Latin American and 
Mexican drug cartels, and Asian transnational crime 
groups. There is a Profi les in Crime feature on the 
Chinese connection, and another showing how the El 
Rukn gang in Chicago worked with Libyans on a trans-
national organized crime scheme. A new Race, Culture, 
Gender, and Criminology feature looks at drug pro-
duction and traffi cking in the Golden Triangle area of 
Southeast Asia.
Chapter 16 (Criminal Justice: Process and Perspec-
 
■
tives) opens with a new vignette telling of a 2010 
case where four California women were convicted in 
an insurance fraud scam that helped them collect 
$1.2 million in phony life insurance policy claims. 
A new Profi les in Crime feature on the outlaw Jesse 
James looks at the career of one of the most storied 
bad men in U.S. history. All the data on the size and 
scope of the justice system and justice process have 
been updated.
Chapter 17 (Police and the Courts: Investigation, 
 
■
Arrest, and Adjudication) includes a new section 
entitled “Is It Worth the Effort?” which looks at ag-
gressive police patrol efforts in order to determine 
called “Bound by Hate” tells how 17-year-old Jeffrey 
Conroy and six other Long Island, New York, teenagers 
decided to hunt for Hispanic men to assault, which led 
to murder.
Chapter 11 (Political Crime and Terrorism)
 
■
 begins 
with the tale of a terror attack that took place in Soma-
lia on August 24, 2010, that killed 33 people but was 
so routine that it barely made the news. New exhibits 
set out political violence in Nepal and notable terror 
prosecutions. There is also the case of the Russian 
spy group of sleeper agents that unraveled in 2010. A 
Thinking Like a Criminologist | An Ethical Dilemma 
box deals with the provocative topic of whether to tor-
ture a suspected terrorist. A section now covers terror 
cells, and another section describes how socialization 
and friendship infl uence the choice of becoming a 
terrorist. There is an analysis of the recent book Un-
conquerable Nation, in which Brian Michael Jenkins, a 
noted expert on the topic, identifi es the strategic prin-
ciples he believes are the key to combating terror in 
contemporary society.
Chapter 12 (Property Crime)
 
■
 has been revised and 
updated. There is a section on overzealous enforcement 
in retail theft that can result in countersuits being fi led. 
A recent case is reviewed in which federal authorities 
uncovered the largest credit card scam in history: a 
group of thieves stole 40 million credit and debit card 
numbers from major retailers by installing “sniffer” 
programs designed to capture credit card numbers, 
passwords, and account information as they moved 
through the retailers’ card processing networks. There 
is a section on car cloning, a new form of professional 
auto theft. The chapter covers confi dence games run by 
swindlers who aspire to separate a victim (or “sucker”) 
from his or her hard-earned money. Another new sec-
tion discusses third-party fraud, which occurs when the 
“victim” is a third party such as an insurance company 
that is forced to pay for false claims.
Chapter 13 (Enterprise Crime: White-Collar and 
 
■
Green-Collar Crime) has been signifi cantly changed 
to refl ect the growing threat of environmental crimes. 
The chapter begins now with the story of Robert Allen 
Stanford, a fi nancier on the tropical island of Antigua, 
who liked to be called “Sir Robert.” Stanford committed 
one of the largest enterprise crimes in history, causing 
people to lose billions. A Profi les in Crime box called 
“Dumping a Dumper” tells the story of Larkin Bag-
gett, who owned and operated a company that illegally 
dumped pollutants onto the ground and into a drain 
that led to a treatment plant. There is a new section on 
the mortgage swindles that threatened to destroy the fi -
nancial system and another on foreclosure rescue scams 
designed to prey upon people who obtained mortgages 
and could not make payments. Another Profi les in 
Crime box, “Clipping the Hedges,” tells of Robert Mof-
fat, a senior executive with IBM, who pleaded guilty

celebrating his 28th birthday.
The Criminological Enterprise 
 
■
features are boxed 
inserts that review important issues in criminology and 
refl ect the major subareas of the fi eld, measuring crime, 
creating theory, crime typologies, legal theory, and 
penology. For example, in Chapter 4, the Criminologi-
cal Enterprise box entitled “Drug Dealer Retaliation” 
discusses the recent work of criminologist Scott Jacques 
who investigated the forms of drug market retalia-
tion and found they followed a rational pattern. In the 
Chapter 7 Criminological Enterprise box, we discuss 
the work of Rand Conger, one of the nation’s leading 
experts on family life, who for the past two decades 
has been involved with four major community studies 
examining the infl uence of economic stress on families, 
children, and adolescents.
Policy and Practice in Criminology 
 
■
boxes show how 
criminological ideas and research can be put into action. 
For example, a Policy and Practice in Criminology box 
in Chapter 2 discusses an innovative mapping program, 
the Crime Analysis Tactical Clearing House, which sup-
ports local law enforcement agencies in analyzing crime 
series and patterns using a number of crime mapping 
and analysis software applications and techniques. An-
other Policy and Practice box, in Chapter 8, discusses 
the Victim Offender Reconciliation Program, designed 
in response to a summer of violence in the metropolitan 
Denver area.
Race, Culture, Gender, and Criminology 
 
■
boxes cover 
issues of racial, sexual, and cultural diversity. For ex-
ample, in Chapter 18, a Race, Culture, Gender, and 
Criminology box entitled “Does Race Matter?” looks 
at whether the fact that there are more minorities in 
prison per capita than whites indicates racial bias in 
sentencing. In Chapter 2, a feature entitled “On the 
Run” looks at the life of inner-city kids who spend 
their time avoiding the police.
Connections
 
■
 are short inserts that help link the mate-
rial to other areas covered in the book. For example, a 
Connections box in Chapter 14 links media violence to 
the material discussed in Chapter 5.
Chapter Outlines
 
■
 provide a roadmap to coverage and 
serve as a useful review tool.
Learning Objectives
 
■
 spell out what students should 
learn in each chapter. The Chapter Summary is geared 
to these objectives.
Thinking Like a Criminologist | An Ethical Dilemma 
 
■
boxes present challenging questions or issues for which 
students must use their criminological knowledge to 
answer or confront ethical dilemmas. Applying the in-
formation learned in the text will help students begin 
to “think like criminologists.”
Each chapter ends with

Critical Thinking Questions 
to help develop students’ critical thinking skills, as well 
as a list of Key Terms.
whether they work and at what price. There is a Policy 
and Practice in Criminology feature on private polic-
ing and a new section on rapid response: it is widely 
assumed that criminals can be caught if the police 
can simply get to the scene of a crime quickly, but 
what do the facts tell us? There is a new section on 
intelligence-led policing, which refers to the collection 
and analysis of information to produce informed po-
lice decision making at both the tactical and strategic 
levels. There is also a new discussion of fusion centers, 
developed in order to exchange information and intel-
ligence, maximize resources, streamline operations, 
and improve the ability to fi ght crime and terrorism by 
analyzing data from a variety of sources. A new Pro-
fi les in Crime feature looks at Ben Roethlisberger, star 
quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who was ac-
cused of rape. Another new Criminological Enterprise 
box considers whether criminals can be caught with 
technology.
Chapter 18 (Punishment and Correction)
 
■
 includes 
updated data on probation, prisons, jails, and parole. 
There is a new section on faith-based programs, in-
cluding research that shows that inmates involved in 
religious programs and education do better following 
release than those in comparison groups. There is a 
new Criminological Enterprise feature on sexual vio-
lence in prison, an important topic since the threat of 
sexual coercion and violence in prison is routine. A new 
section on racial segregation addresses the questions: 
should prisons be segregated to prevent violence or 
are inmates entitled to equal treatment under the law, 
and is any form of segregation considered inherently 
unconstitutional?
FEATURES
This text contains different kinds of pedagogy that help stu-
dents analyze material in greater depth and also link it to 
other material in the book:
Profi les in Crime

present students with case studies of 
actual criminals and crimes to help illustrate the posi-
tion or views within the chapter. By popular demand, 
we have expanded the feature for this edition, present-
ing even more real-life “from the headlines” criminal 
cases throughout the text. For example, Chapter 2 
presents a Profi les in Crime box about the 2009 case 
of a large Harrisburg, Pennsylvania–based prostitution 
ring that was broken up by federal, state, and county 
investigators. Another Profi les in Crime feature, “Al-
legations of Rape,” found in Chapter 17, talks about 
Ben Roethlisberger, star quarterback of the Pittsburgh 
Steelers, who was accused of rape while bar hopping

How is crime defi ned? How much crime is there, and what are the trends and 
patterns in the crime rate? How many people fall victim to crime, and who is 
likely to become a crime victim? How did our system of criminal law develop, 
and what are the basic elements of crimes? What is the science of criminology 
all about?
These are some of the core issues that will be addressed in the fi rst three 
chapters of this text. Chapter 1 introduces students to the fi eld of criminology: 
its nature, area of study, methodologies, and historical development. Concern 
about crime and justice has been an important part of the human condition 
for more than 5,000 years, since the fi rst criminal codes were set down in the Middle East. 
 Although criminology—the scientifi c study of crime—is considered a modern science, 
it has existed for more than 200 years. Chapter 1 introduces students to one of the key 
components of criminology—the development of criminal law. It also discusses the social 
history of law, the purpose of law, and how law defi nes crime. Chapter 2 focuses on the 
acquisition of crime data, crime rate trends, and observable patterns within the crime rate. 
Chapter 3 is devoted to victims and victimization. Topics include the effects of victimiza-
tion, the cause of victimization, and efforts to help crime victims.

NATALEE
Natalee Holloway, 18, from the Birmingham, Alabama, suburb of Mountain Brook, celebrated her high school 
graduation by going on a holiday to the Caribbean island of Aruba with about 100 classmates and several 
parent chaperones. On the night of May 30, 2005, she went to a local bar and was later seen leaving with 
three men—two brothers from Surinam and a local boy, the son of a high-ranking Dutch judicial offi cial. 
Holloway never returned to her hotel nor did she appear in any security camera footage of the hotel lobby 
in the course of the night. When she did not show up for the fl ight home, her passport, luggage, and mobile 
phone were found in her hotel room.
The three suspects in the case, Joran van der Sloot and brothers Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe, were 
arrested on June 9, 2005. However, the police could not come up with suffi cient evidence to make the charges

4  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
How this field developed, its major components, and its 
 relationship to crime law and deviance are some of the top-
ics discussed in this chapter.
This text analyzes criminology and its major subareas of 
inquiry. It focuses on the nature and extent of crime, the 
causes of crime, and patterns of criminal behavior. This 
chapter introduces and defi nes criminology: What are its 
goals? How do criminologists defi ne crime? How do they 
conduct research? What ethical issues face those wishing to 
conduct criminological research?
WHAT IS CRIMINOLOGY?
Criminology is the scientifi c approach to studying criminal 
behavior. In their classic defi nition, preeminent criminolo-
gists Edwin Sutherland and Donald Cressey state:
Criminology is the body of knowledge regarding crime 
as a social phenomenon. It includes within its scope 
the processes of making laws, of breaking laws, and of 
reacting toward the breaking of laws. . . . The objective 
of criminology is the development of a body of general 
and verifi ed principles and of other types of knowledge 
regarding this process of law, crime, and treatment.3
stick, and the Kalpoes and Van der Sloot were released. Van der Sloot was required to stay within Dutch 
territory and he returned to the Netherlands to attend college.
The three young men had told the police that they took Holloway to Arashi Beach, on Aruba’s northern 
tip, and at 2 A.M. dropped her off at her hotel, where they saw her being approached by a security guard as 
they drove off.1 This was one of several stories circulating about the case, including claims that Holloway had 
been sold into sexual slavery and that she had died on the beach and her body was dumped at sea.
The case remains unsolved but not forgotten. In 2010, it was suddenly back on the front page: Van 
der Sloot approached Natalee Holloway’s family in an effort to extort money from them in exchange for 
information on their daughter, including the location of her body. After being paid $15,000 for information 
that turned out to be false, Van der Sloot used the cash to travel to Lima, Peru. There, on May 30, 2010, the 
fi fth anniversary of Holloway’s disappearance, a local girl, Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez, 21, was found 
dead in the Hotel TAC; the room had been registered in the name of Joran van der Sloot! Witnesses put 
the unfortunate young woman and Van der Sloot in the hotel together, and a video showed the two playing 
cards at the same table at a local casino. Ramírez’s jewelry, ID, and credit cards were missing, as well as over 
$10,000 she had won earlier that evening at the casino. Captured in Columbia, Van der Sloot was returned 
to Peru where he remains in a high-security Peruvian prison. He is said to have admitted killing Ramírez 
because she used his laptop without permission.
How can we explain the behavior of a Joran van der Sloot? 
What motivates a young man to become a multiple killer? 
Tall, handsome, educated, and wealthy, he hardly fi ts the 
profile of a cold-blooded murderer of young women. He 
was not a “product of his environment”; his crimes were not 
“gang related.” Is it possible that his violent behavior was 
a function of some psychological abnormality or biological 
defect? Yet, those who knew him did not suspect he had a 
murderous side, nor did the police in Aruba describe him as 
mentally disturbed or deranged.
The questions about crime and its control raised by the 
Natalee Holloway/Joran van der Sloot case and other high-pro-
fi le criminal incidents have spurred interest in  criminology, 
an academic discipline that uses the scientifi c method to study 
the nature, extent, cause, and control of criminal behavior. 
Unlike political figures and media commentators—whose 
opinions about crime may be colored by personal experi-
ences, biases, and election concerns—criminologists remain 
objective as they study crime and its consequences.2
Criminology is a multidisciplinary science. Crimi-
nologists hold degrees in a variety of diverse fi elds, most 
commonly sociology, but also criminal justice, political sci-
ence, psychology, public policy, economics, and the natural 
sciences.
For most of the twentieth century, criminology’s primary 
orientation was sociological, but today it can be viewed as 
an integrated approach to the study of criminal behavior.

of crime and its causation. It is common, therefore, for 
 criminal justice programs to feature courses on criminol-
ogy and for criminology courses to evaluate the agencies of 
justice.
Criminology and Deviance
Criminology is also related to the study of deviant 
 behaviors—those actions that depart from social norms, 
values, and beliefs. Included within the broad spectrum of 
deviant acts are behaviors ranging from violent crimes to 
joining a nudist colony. However, signifi cant distinctions 
can be made between these two areas of study because 
many crimes are not unusual or deviant, and many deviant 
acts are neither illegal nor criminal.
Take, for instance, substance abuse. Selling and/or pos-
sessing recreational drugs, such as marijuana, may be ille-
gal, but can it actually be considered deviant? A signifi cant 
percentage of the population have used or are using drugs; 
more than half of all high school students have tried drugs 
before they graduate.4 Therefore, it is erroneous to argue 
that all crimes are deviant behaviors that depart from the 
norms of society.
Similarly, many deviant acts are not criminal even 
though they may be both disturbing and shocking to the 
conscience. Suppose a passerby witnesses someone fl oun-
dering in the ocean and makes no rescue attempt. Most 
people would condemn the onlooker’s coldhearted behavior 
as callous, immoral, and deviant. However, no legal action 
could be taken since a private citizen is not required by law 
to risk his or her own life to save another’s. There is no le-
gal requirement that a person rush into a burning building, 
brave a fl ood, or jump into the ocean to save someone from 
harm. They may be deviant and not share commonly held 
values, but according to the law, they are not criminals.
In sum, criminologists are concerned with the concept 
of deviance and its relationship to criminality, whereas those 
sociologists who study deviant behaviors often want to un-
derstand and/or identify the line that separates criminal from 
merely unusual behaviors. The shifting defi nition of deviant 
behavior is closely associated with our concepts of crime. 
The relationships among criminology, criminal justice, and 
deviance are illustrated in Concept Summary 1.1.
The principal purpose of the Office on National
Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is to establish 
policies, priorities, and objectives for the nation’s drug 
control program, the goals of which are to reduce illicit 
drug use, manufacturing, and trafficking; reduce drug-
related crime and violence; and reduce drug-related 
health consequences.  For more information about the 
United States’ program for controlling drugs, visit the 
Criminal Justice CourseMate at cengagebrain.com, then 
access the “Web Links” for this chapter.
Sutherland and Cressey’s defi nition includes some of the 
most important areas of interest to criminologists:
Crime as a social phenomenon.
 
■
 Although some criminolo-
gists believe that individual traits and characteristics 
may play some role in the cause of criminals’ antisocial 
behavior, most believe that social factors are at the root 
cause of crime. Even the most disturbed people are in-
fl uenced by their environment and their social interac-
tions and personal relationships.
The processes of making laws.
 
■
 Sutherland and Cressey’s 
defi nition recognizes the association between crime and 
the criminal law and shows how the law defi nes crime. 
How and why laws are created and why some are 
strengthened and others eliminated is of great interest 
to criminologists.
Breaking laws and reacting toward the breaking of laws.
 
■
 At 
its core, the purpose of criminology is to understand 
both the onset of crime and the most effective meth-
ods for its elimination. Why do people commit illegal 
acts, and what can be done to convince them—and 
others who are contemplating crime—that it is in their 
best interests to turn their back on criminality? These 
concepts are naturally bound together: it is impossible 
to effectively control crime unless we understand its 
cause.
Development of a body of general and verifi ed principles.
 
■
 
Sutherland and Cressey recognize that criminology is a 
social science and criminologists must use the  scientifi c 
method when conducting research. Criminologists are 
required to employ valid and reliable experimental de-
signs and sophisticated data analysis techniques or else 
lose standing in the academic community.
Criminology and Criminal Justice
Although the terms criminology and criminal justice may seem 
similar, and people often confuse the two or lump them to-
gether, there are major differences between these fi elds of 
study. Criminology explains the etiology (origin), extent, 
and nature of crime in society, whereas criminal justice re-
fers to the study of the agencies of social control—police, 
courts, and corrections. While criminologists are mainly 
concerned with identifying the suspected cause of crime, 
criminal justice scholars spend their time identifying effec-
tive methods of crime control.
Since both fields are crime-related, they do overlap. 
Some criminologists devote their research to justice and 
social control and are concerned with how the agencies of 
justice operate, how they influence crime and criminals, 
and how justice policies shape crime rates and trends. 
 Conversely, criminal justice experts often want to design 
 effective programs of crime prevention or rehabilitation 
and to do so must develop an understanding of the nature

perspectives are now contained within the broader arena 
of criminology. Taken together, these subareas make up the 
criminological enterprise. Criminologists may specialize in 
a subarea in the same way that psychologists might specialize 
in a subfi eld of psychology, such as cognition, development, 
perception, personality, psychopathology, or sexuality.
Criminal Statistics and Crime 
Measurement
The subarea of criminal statistics and crime measurement 
involves devising valid and reliable measures designed to 
calculate the amount and trends of criminal activity: How 
much crime occurs annually? Who commits it? When and 
where does it occur? Which crimes are the most serious? 
Criminologists:
Formulate techniques for collecting and analyzing insti-
 
■
tutional (police, court, and correctional agency) records 
and data.
Develop survey instruments to measure criminal activity 
 
■
not reported to the police by victims. These instruments 
can by used to estimate the percentage of people who 
commit crimes but escape detection by the justice system.
Identify the victims of crime; create surveys designed to 
 
■
have victims report loss and injury that may not have 
been reported to the police.
Develop data that can be used to test crime theory. For 
 
■
example, measuring community-level crime rates can 
help prove whether ecological factors, such as neigh-
borhood poverty and unemployment rates, are related 
to crime rates.
Those criminologists who devote themselves to criminal 
statistics engage in a number of different tasks, including:
Devising accurate methods of collecting crime data
 
■
Using these tested methods to measure the amount and 
 
■
trends of criminal activity
Using valid crime data to determine who commits 
 
■
crime and where it occurs
Measuring the effect of social policy and social trends 
 
■
on crime rate changes
Using crime data to design crime prevention programs 
 
■
and then measuring their effectiveness
The media love to sensationalize crime and report on lu-
rid cases of murder and rape. The general public is infl uenced 
by these stories, becoming fearful and altering their behavior 
to avoid victimization.6 These news accounts, proclaiming 
crime waves, are often driven by the need to sell newspapers 
or increase TV viewership. There is nothing like an impend-
ing crime wave or serial killer on the loose to boost reader-
ship or viewership. Media accounts therefore can be biased 
and inaccurate, and it is up to criminologists to set the re-
cord straight. Criminologists try to create valid and reliable 
measurements of criminal behavior. They create techniques 
WHAT CRIMINOLOGISTS 
DO: THE CRIMINOLOGICAL 
ENTERPRISE
Regardless of their theoretical orientation, criminologists are 
devoted to the study of crime and criminal behavior. As two 
noted criminologists, Marvin Wolfgang and Franco Ferracuti, 
put it: “A criminologist is one whose professional training, oc-
cupational role, and pecuniary reward are primarily concen-
trated on a scientifi c approach to, and study and analysis of, 
the phenomenon of crime and criminal behavior.”5
Because criminologists have been trained in diverse 
fi elds, several subareas refl ecting different orientations and 
CONCEPT SUMMARY 1.1
Criminology: Criminal Justice and Deviance
Criminology
Criminology explores the etiology (origin), extent, and nature of 
crime in society. Criminologists are concerned with identifying 
the nature, extent, and cause of crime.
Criminal Justice
Criminal justice refers to the agencies of social control that 
handle criminal offenders. Criminal justice scholars engage 
in describing, analyzing, and explaining operations of the 
agencies of justice, specifically the police departments, courts, 
and correctional facilities. They seek more effective methods of 
crime control and offender rehabilitation.
Overlapping Areas of Concern
Criminal justice experts cannot begin to design effective 
programs of crime prevention or rehabilitation without 
understanding the nature and cause of crime. They require 
accurate criminal statistics and data to test the effectiveness of 
crime control and prevention programs.
Deviance
Deviance refers to the study of behavior that departs from 
social norms. Included within the broad spectrum of deviant 
acts are behaviors ranging from violent crimes to joining a 
nudist colony. Not all crimes are deviant or unusual acts, and 
not all deviant acts are illegal.
Overlapping Areas of Concern
Under what circumstances do deviant behaviors become 
crimes? When does sexually oriented material cross the line 
from merely suggestive to obscene and therefore illegal? If 
an illegal act becomes a norm, should society reevaluate its 
criminal status? There is still debate over the legalization 
and/or decriminalization of abortion, recreational drug use, 
possession of handguns, and assisted suicide.

CHAPTER 1 | Crime and Criminology  7
to access the records of police and court agencies and use so-
phisticated statistical methods to understand underlying pat-
terns and trends. They develop survey instruments and then 
use them with large samples to determine the actual number 
of crimes being committed and the number of victims who 
suffer criminal violations: how many people are victims of 
crime, and what percentage reports the crime to police.
Criminologists are also interested in helping agents of 
the criminal justice system develop effective crime control 
policies that rely on accurate measurement of crime rates. 
By using advanced statistical techniques to calculate where 
crime will take place, police departments can allocate patrol 
offi cers based on these predictions.7
The development of valid methods to measure crime 
and the accuracy of crime data are crucial aspects of the 
criminological enterprise. Without valid and reliable crime 
data sources, efforts to conduct research on crime and create 
criminological theories would be futile. It is also important 
to determine why crime rates vary across and within regions 
in order to gauge the association between social and eco-
nomic forces and criminal activity.
About 10.5 million crimes were reported in 2009, a drop 
of more than 4 million reported crimes since the 1991 peak, 
and this despite a boost of about 50 million in the general 
population. Are the crime trends and patterns experienced 
in the United States unique or do they occur in other cul-
tures as well? This issue is explored in the accompanying 
Race, Culture, Gender, and Criminology feature.
Sociology of Law, Law and Society, 
Socio-Legal Studies
The sociology of law, also referred to as the study of law and 
society, is a subarea of criminology concerned with the role 
social forces play in shaping criminal law and, concomi-
tantly, the role of criminal law in shaping society. Criminolo-
gists interested in studying the social aspects of law focus on 
such topics as:
The history of legal thought
 
■
How social forces shape the defi nition and content of 
 
■
the law
The impact of legal change on society
 
■
The relationship between law and social control
 
■
The effect of criminalization/legalization on behaviors
 
■
Some criminologists who study law and society consider 
the role of law in the context of criminological theory. They 
try to understand how legal decision making infl uences in-
dividuals, groups, and the criminal justice system. Others 
try to identify alternatives to traditional legal process—for 
example, by designing nonpunitive methods of dispute res-
olution. Some seek to describe the legal system and identify 
and explain patterns of behavior that guide its operation. 
Others use the operations of law as a perspective for under-
standing culture and social life.8
Because the law is constantly evolving, criminologists are 
often asked to determine whether legal change is required 
and what shape it should take. Criminologists may use 
their research skills to assess the effects of a proposed legal 
change. Take for instance the crime of obscenity.  Typically, 
there is no uniform standard of what is considered obscene; 
material that to some people is lewd and offensive may be 
considered a work of art by others. How far should the law 
go in curbing “adult fi lms” and literature? Criminologists 
might conduct research aimed at determining the effect 
the proposed law will have on curbing access to obscene 
 material such as child pornography. Other relevant research 
issues might include analysis of the harmful effects of view-
ing pornography: Are people who view pornography more 
likely to commit violent crime than non-watchers? And 
what about the effect of virtual porn? Is viewing computer-
generated sexual imagery the same as viewing live actors? 
The answers may one day shape the direction of legislation 
controlling sexual content on the Internet.
Computer fraud, fi le sharing, ATM theft, and cyberstalk-
ing did not exist when the nation was founded. Consequently, 
the law must be revised to refl ect cultural, societal, and tech-
nological changes. In fact, the Supreme Court has often con-
sidered empirical research supplied by criminologists on such 
topics as racial discrimination in the death penalty before it 
renders an opinion.9 The research conducted by criminolo-
gists then helps shape the direction of their legal decision 
making. Might the research discussed in the accompanying

Theory Construction and Testing
Social theory can be defi ned as a systematic set of interre-
lated statements or principles that explain some aspect of 
social life. At their core, theories should serve as models 
or frameworks for understanding human behavior and the 
forces that shape its content and direction.
Because, ideally, theories are based on verified social 
facts—readily observed phenomena that can be consistently 
quantifi ed and measured—criminological theorists use the 
scientifi c method to test their theories. They gather data, 
derive hypotheses—testable expectations of behavior that 
can be derived from the theory—and then test them using 
valid empirical research methods. For example, social learn-
ing theory (see Chapter 7) states that people learn behavior 
through both observation and experience. If this statement 
is accurate, then logically there should be a signifi cant as-
sociation between observing domestic abuse, experiencing 
child abuse, and becoming an abuser. To test this theory, a 
number of hypotheses can be derived:
H1: People who are abused as children will grow up to 
become abusive parents.
H2: People who observe domestic abuse in their child-
hood will grow up to become abusers themselves.

8  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
Sometimes criminologists use innovative methods to 
test theory. For example, to determine whether abuse is a 
learned behavior or a function of some biological abnor-
mality, criminologists Tatia M. C. Lee, Siu-Ching Chan, and 
Adrian Raine used a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) de-
vice to assess brain function of 10 male batterers and then 
compared the results with those attained from a similar 
sample of non-abusers. Brain scanning revealed that batter-
ers showed signifi cantly higher neural hyper-responsivity 
to the threat stimuli in a variety of regions of the brain. This 
means that when these hypersensitive men experience even 
mild provocations from their spouses they are hard-wired to 
H3: The more serious and prolonged the observed 
abuse, the more likely those abused will become abu-
sive themselves.
H4: Child abuse and domestic abuse are intergenera-
tional. Abusers are the offspring of abusers and become 
the parents of abusers.
To test this theory, criminologists might conduct a lon-
gitudinal study to determine if (a) people who abuse their 
spouses and children were abused themselves in childhood 
and (b) whether the parents of abusers were abused in child-
hood by their parents.
Although the United States once led the 
Western world in overall crime, there has 
been a marked decline in U.S. crime rates, 
which are now below those of other indus-
trial nations, including England and Wales, 
Denmark, and Finland.
Making international comparisons is of-
ten difficult because the legal definitions of 
crime vary from country to country. There 
are also differences in the way crime is mea-
sured. For example, in the United States, 
crime may be measured by counting crimi-
nal acts reported to the police or by using 
victim surveys, whereas in many European 
countries, the number of cases solved by 
the police is used as the measure of crime. 
Despite these problems, valid comparisons 
can still be made about crime across dif-
ferent countries using a number of reliable 
data sources. For example, the United Na-
tions Survey of Crime Trends and Operations 
of Criminal Justice Systems (UNCJS) is one 
of the best-known sources of information 
on cross-national data. There is also the 
United Nations International Study on the 
Regulation of Firearms.  INTERPOL, an in-
ternational police agency, collects data from 
police agencies in 179 countries. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) has conducted 
surveys on global violence. The European 
Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice 
Statistics provides data from police agen-
cies in 36 European nations. Finally, the 
International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) is 
conducted in 60 countries and managed by 
the Ministry of Justice of the Netherlands, 
the Home Office of the United Kingdom, 
and the United Nations Interregional Crime 
and Justice Research Institute, and has 
become a reliable source of cross-cultural 
crime and victimization trends.
What do these data sources tell us about 
crime in other cultures? The ICVS is per-
haps the best source today on determining 
crime and victimization rates and trends. 
According to the most recent ICVS, an es-
timated 16 percent of the population in the 
nations included in the survey have been a 
victim of at least one of ten common crimes 
(such as burglary, robbery, theft, assault) in 
the course of the last year. The countries 
with the highest scores are Ireland, Eng-
land and Wales, New Zealand, and Iceland. 
Lowest overall victimization rates are found 
in Spain, Japan, Hungary, and Portugal. 
Similar to the United States, there has been 
a distinct downward trend in the level of 
crime and victimization during the past de-
cade. Also, as in the U.S., some cities have 
much higher crime rates than others: the 
cities in developed countries with the lowest 
victimization rates are Hong Kong, Lisbon, 
Budapest, Athens, and Madrid; highest 
victimization rates are found in London and 
Tallinn, Estonia. The drops are most pro-
nounced in property crimes such as vehi-
cle-related crimes (bicycle theft, thefts from 
cars, and joyriding) and burglary. In most 
countries, crime rates are back at the level 
of the late 1980s. One reason is that people 
around the world are taking precautions to 
prevent crime. Improved security may well 
have been one of the main forces behind 
the universal drop in crimes such as joyrid-
ing and household burglary.
What do the cross-national data tell us 
about individual crimes?
Homicide
Many nations, especially those experiencing 
social or economic upheaval, have murder 
rates much higher than the United States. Co-
lombia has about 63 homicides per 100,000 
people, and South Africa has 51, compared 
to fewer than 6 in the United States. Dur-
ing the 1990s, there were more homicides 
in Brazil than in the United States, Canada, 
Italy, Japan,  Australia, Portugal, Britain, Aus-
tria, and Germany combined. Why are mur-
der rates so high in Brazil? Law enforcement 
officials link the upsurge in violence to drug 
trafficking, gang feuds, vigilantism, and dis-
putes over trivial matters, in which young, 
unmarried, uneducated males are involved.
Rape
Violence against women is related to eco-
nomic hardship and the social status of 
women. Rates are high in poor nations 
in which women are oppressed. Where 
women are more emancipated, the rates of 
violence against women are lower.

made to describe and understand particular crime types. 
Marvin Wolfgang’s famous 1958 study, Patterns in Criminal 
Homicide—considered a landmark analysis of the nature of 
homicide and the relationship between victim and offender—
found that victims often precipitate the incident that results in 
their death.11 Edwin Sutherland’s analysis of business-related 
offenses helped coin a new phrase—white-collar crime—to 
describe economic crime activities.
Criminologists also conduct research on the links be-
tween different types of crime and criminals. This is known 
as a crime typology. Some typologies focus on the crimi-
nal, suggesting the existence of offender groups, such as 
respond with violence. Rather than being a learned behav-
ior, Lee and his associates conclude there is a neurobiologi-
cal predisposition to spouse abuse in some men.10
Criminal Behavior Systems 
and Crime Typologies
Criminologists who study criminal behavior systems and 
crime typologies focus their research on specific criminal 
types and patterns: violent crime, theft crime, public order 
crime, and organized crime. Numerous attempts have been 
For many women, sexual violence starts 
in childhood and adolescence and may 
occur in the home, school, and commu-
nity. Studies conducted in a wide variety 
of nations ranging from Cameroon to New 
 Zealand found high rates of reported forced 
sexual initiation. In some nations, more 
than 40 percent of adolescent women and 
20 percent of adolescent men report sexual 
coercion at the hands of family members, 
teachers, boyfriends, or strangers.
Sexual violence has significant health 
consequences, including suicide, stress, 
mental illnesses, unwanted pregnancies, 
sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, 
self-inflicted injuries, and, in the case of 
child sexual abuse, adoption of high-risk 
behaviors such as multiple sexual partners 
and drug use.
Robbery
Countries with more reported robberies 
than the United States include England and 
Wales, Portugal, and Spain. Countries with 
fewer reported robberies include Germany, 
Italy, and France, as well as Middle Eastern 
and Asian nations.
Burglary
The United States has lower burglary rates 
than Australia, Denmark, Finland, England 
and Wales, and Canada. It has higher re-
ported burglary rates than Spain, Korea, 
and Saudi Arabia.
Vehicle Theft
Australia, England and Wales, Denmark, 
Norway, Canada, France, and Italy now 
have higher rates of vehicle theft than the 
United States.
Child Abuse
A World Health Organization report found 
that child physical and sexual abuse takes 
a significant toll around the world. In a sin-
gle year, about 57,000 children under 15 
years of age are murdered. The homicide 
rates for children aged 0 to 4 years were 
over twice as high as rates among children 
aged 5 to 14 years. Many more children are 
subjected to nonfatal abuse and neglect; 
8 percent of male and 25 percent of female 
children up to age 18 experience sexual 
abuse of some kind.
Gun Crimes
There has been a common assumption that 
the United States is the most heavily armed 
nation on earth, but there is new evidence 
that people around the world are arming 
themselves in record numbers. Residents 
in the 15 countries of the European Union 
have an estimated 84 million firearms. Of 
these, 67 million (80 percent) are in civil-
ian hands. With a total population of 375 
million people, this amounts to 17 guns for 
every 100 people.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Although risk factors at all levels of so-
cial and personal life contribute to youth 
violence, young people in all nations 
who experience change in societal-level 
factors—such as economic inequalities, 
rapid social change, and the availability 
of firearms, alcohol, and drugs—seem 
the most likely to get involved in vio-
lence. Can anything be done to help 
alleviate these social problems?
 2. The United States is notorious for em-
ploying much tougher penal measures 
than European nations. Do you believe 
our tougher measures would work 
abroad and should be adopted there as 
well? Is there a downside to putting lots 
of people in prison?

“terrorist personality.” Among the fi ndings:
Mental illness is not a critical factor in explaining terror-

There is no “terrorist personality,” nor is there any accurate 
 
■
profi le—psychologically or otherwise—of the terrorist.
professional criminals, psychotic criminals, amateur crimi-
nals, and so on. Others focus on the crimes, clustering them 
into categories such as property crimes, sex crimes, and so 
on. While 50 years ago they might have focused their atten-
tion on rape, murder, and burglary, they now may be look-
ing at stalking, cybercrime, terrorism, and hate crimes. For 
example, a number of criminologists are now doing research 
a Predator” on Dateline NBC), and appease 
the public’s desire to “do something” about 
child predators, do they actually work? Does 
registration deter future sex offenses and re-
duce the incidence of predatory acts against 
children?
To answer this question, criminologists 
Kristen Zgoba and Karen Bachar recently 
(2009) conducted an in-depth study of 
the effectiveness of New Jersey’s registra-
tion law and found that while expensive 
to maintain, the system did not produce 
effective results. On the one hand, sex of-
fense rates in New Jersey were in a steep 
decline before the system was installed and 
the rate of decline actually slowed down af-
ter 1995 when the law took effect. Zgoba 
and Bachar’s data show that the greatest 
rate of decline in sex offending occurred 
prior to the passage and implementation of 
Megan’s Law. On the other hand, passage 
and implementation of Megan’s Law did not 
reduce the number of rearrests for sex of-
fenses, nor did it have any demonstrable 
effect on the time between when sex of-
fenders were released from prison and the 
time they were rearrested for any new of-
fense, such as a drug, theft, or another sex 
offense.
In another effort, Jill Levenson,  Elizabeth 
Letourneau, Kevin Armstrong, and Kris-
ten Zgoba investigated the relationship 
between failure to register (FTR) as a sex 
offender and subsequent recidivism with 
a sample of 3,000 people convicted of 
sexually related crimes. Levenson and her 
associates found that there was no signifi-
cant difference in the proportion of sexual 
recidivists and nonrecidivists with registra-
tion violations nor did FTR predict sexual 
recidivism. And when there was recidivism, 
there was no significant difference in time 
to recidivism when comparing those who 
failed to register (2.9 years) with compliant 
registrants (2.8 years).
These results challenge the effective-
ness of sex offender registration laws. 
Rather than deter crime, sex offender laws 
may merely cause sex offenders to be more 
cautious while giving parents a false sense 
of security. For example, offenders may tar-
get victims in other states or communities 
where they are not registered and parents 
are less cautious.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Considering the findings of Zgoba and 
Bachar, would you advocate aban-
doning sex offender registration laws 
because they are ineffective? Or might 
there be other reasons to keep them 
active?
 2. What other laws do you think should be 
the topic of careful scientific inquiry to 
see if they actually work as advertised?

to Register as a Sex Offender: Is It Associated 
with Recidivism?” Justice Quarterly 27 (2010):

Doe, 538 U.S. 1 (2003); Kristen Zgoba and

(accessed October 29, 2010).
Criminologists interested in legal studies 
also evaluate the impact new laws have 
on society after they have been in effect 
for awhile. Take for instance the practice 
of sex offender registration, which requires 
convicted sex offenders to register with lo-
cal law enforcement agencies when they 
move into a community. These are often 
called Megan’s Laws in memory of 7-year-
old Megan Kanka, killed in 1994 by sex 
offender Jesse Timmendequas, who had 
moved unannounced into her New Jersey 
neighborhood. Megan’s Laws require law 
enforcement authorities to make informa-
tion available to the public regarding regis-
tered sex offenders, including the offender’s 
name, picture, address, incarceration date, 
and nature of crime. The information can 
be published in newspapers or put on a sex 
offender website.
In Connecticut Dept. of Public Safety v. 
Doe (2003), the U.S. Supreme Court up-
held the legality of sex offender registra-
tion when it ruled that persons convicted of 
sexual offenses may be required to register 
with a state’s Department of Public Safety 
and then be listed on a sex offender reg-
istry on the Internet containing registrants’ 
names, addresses, photographs, and de-
scriptions. In a 9–0 opinion upholding the 
plan, the Court reasoned that, because the 
law was based on the fact that a defendant 
had been convicted of a sex offense, dis-
closing their names on the registry without 
a hearing did not violate due process.
But while sex offender registration laws 
may be constitutional and pervasive (they 
are used in all 50 states), appeal to politi-
cians who may be swayed by media cru-
sades against child molesters (i.e., “To Catch

of crime is not complete unless the victim’s role is consid-
ered.14 For those studying the role of the victim in crime, 
these areas are of particular interest:
Using victim surveys to measure the nature and extent 
 
■
of criminal behavior not reported to the police
Calculating the actual costs of crime to victims
 
■
Measuring the factors that increase the likelihood of 
 
■
 becoming a crime victim
Studying the role of the victim in causing or precipitat-
 
■
ing crime
Designing services for the victims of crime, such as 
 
■
counseling and compensation programs
The study of victims and victimization has uncovered 
some startling results. For one thing, criminals have been 
found to be at greater risk for victimization than noncrimi-
nals.15 Rather than being the passive receptors of criminal 
acts who are in the “wrong place at the wrong time,” crime 
victims may engage in high-risk lifestyles that increase their 
own chance of victimization and make them highly vulner-
able to crime. 
The various elements of the criminological enterprise 
are summarized in Concept Summary 1.2.
Histories of childhood abuse and 
 
■
trauma and themes of perceived 
injustice and humiliation often 
are prominent in terrorist biog-
raphies, but do not really help to 
explain terrorism.12
Research on criminal behavior 
systems and crime types is important 
because it enables criminologists to 
understand why people commit spe-
cific sorts of crime, and using this 
information, gives them the tools to 
devise crime reduction strategies.
Punishment, Penology, 
and Social Control
Criminologists also are involved in creating effective crime 
policies, developing methods of social control, and the 
correction and control of known criminal offenders; it is 
this segment of criminology that overlaps criminal justice. 
Criminologists conduct research that is designed to evalu-
ate justice initiatives in order to determine their effi ciency, 
effectiveness, and impact. For example, should capital 
punishment continue to be employed or is its use simply 
too risky? To explore this issue, Samuel Gross and his col-
leagues looked at death row inmates who were later found 
to be innocent. The sample of 340 death row inmates (327 
men and 13 women), exonerated after having served years 
in prison, indicated that about half (144 people) were 
cleared by DNA evidence. Collectively, they had spent 
more than 3,400 years in prison for crimes they did not 
commit—an average of more than 10 years each. Gross and 
his colleagues found that exonerations from death row are 
more than 25 times more frequent than exonerations for 
other prisoners convicted of murder, and more than 100 
times more frequent than for all imprisoned felons.13 How 
many wrongful convictions might be uncovered if all crimi-
nal convictions were given the same degree of scrutiny as 
death penalty cases? The Gross research illustrates how im-
portant it is to evaluate penal measures in order to deter-
mine their effectiveness and reliability.
Victimology: Victims 
and Victimization
In two classic criminological studies, one by Hans von Hen-
tig and the other by Stephen Schafer, the critical role of the 
victim in the criminal process was fi rst identifi ed. These au-
thors were the fi rst to suggest that victim behavior is often 
a key determinant of crime and that victims’ actions may 
actually precipitate crime. Both men believe that the study 
In recent years, criminologists have devoted ever-
 increasing attention to the victim’s role in the criminal 
process. It has been suggested that a person’s lifestyle 
and behavior may actually increase the risk that he or 
she will become a crime victim. Some have suggested 
that living in a high-crime neighborhood increases risk; 
others point at the problems caused by associating with 
dangerous peers and companions. For a discussion of 
victimization risk, see Chapter 3.

12  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
substantive criminal law, which is the written code that 
defi nes crimes and their punishments, refl ects the values, 
beliefs, and opinions of society’s mainstream. The term con-
sensus is used because it implies that there is general agree-
ment among a majority of citizens on what behaviors should 
be outlawed by the criminal law and henceforth viewed as 
crimes. As the eminent criminologists Edwin Sutherland 
and Donald Cressey put it:
Criminal behavior is behavior in violation of the crimi-
nal law. . . . [I]t is not a crime unless it is prohibited by 
the criminal law [which] is defi ned conventionally as a 
body of specifi c rules regarding human conduct which 
have been promulgated by political authority, which 
apply uniformly to all members of the classes to which 
the rules refer, and which are enforced by punishment 
administered by the state.16
This approach to crime implies that it is a function of the 
beliefs, morality, and rules established by the existing legal 
power structure. According to Sutherland and Cressey’s state-
ment, criminal law is applied “uniformly to all members of 
the classes to which the rules refer.” This statement reveals 
the authors’ faith in the concept of an “ideal legal system” that 
deals adequately with all classes and types of people. Laws 
prohibiting theft and violence may be directed at the neediest 
members of society, whereas laws that sanction economic acts 
such as insider trading, embezzlement, and corporate price-
fi xing are aimed at controlling the wealthiest. The reach of the 
criminal law is not restricted to any single element of society.
Social Harm The consensus view of crime links illegal be-
havior to the concept of social harm. Though people gener-
ally enjoy a great deal of latitude in their behavior, it is agreed 
that behaviors that are harmful to other people and society in 
general must be controlled. Social harm is what sets strange, 
unusual, or deviant behavior—or any other action that de-
parts from social norms—apart from criminal behaviors.17
The associations among crime, social harm, and moral-
ity are best illustrated in efforts to criminalize acts con-
sidered dangerous to the public welfare because they 
involve behaviors that offend existing social values. 
These so-called public order crimes include pornogra-
phy, prostitution, and drug use. Though “victims” are 
often willing participants, some people believe it is so-
ciety’s duty to save them from themselves. To read more 
about crime, morality, and social harm, see Chapter 14.
CONNECTIONS
This position is not without controversy. Although it is 
clear that rape, robbery, and murder are inherently harmful 
and their control justifi ed, behaviors such as drug use and 
prostitution are more problematic because the harm they in-
fl ict is only on those who are willing participants. According 
HOW CRIMINOLOGISTS 
VIEW CRIME
Professional criminologists usually align themselves with 
one of several schools of thought or perspectives in their 
fi eld. Each perspective maintains its own view of what con-
stitutes criminal behavior and what causes people to en-
gage in criminality. This diversity of thought is not unique 
to criminology; biologists, psychologists, sociologists, his-
torians, economists, and natural scientists disagree among 
themselves about critical issues in their fi elds. Considering 
the multidisciplinary nature of the fi eld of criminology, fun-
damental issues such as the nature and defi nition of crime 
itself are cause for disagreement among criminologists.
A criminologist’s choice of orientation or perspective de-
pends, in part, on his or her defi nition of crime. This section 
discusses the three most common concepts of crime used by 
criminologists.

believed to be repugnant to all elements of society. The

CHAPTER 1 | Crime and Criminology  13
Crime, according to this defi nition, is a political con-
cept designed to protect the power and position of the 
upper classes at the expense of the poor. Even crimes 
prohibiting violent acts, such as armed robbery, rape, and 
murder, may have political undertones. Banning violent 
acts ensures domestic tranquility and guarantees that the 
anger of the poor and disenfranchised classes will not be 
directed at their wealthy capitalist exploiters. According to 
this confl ict view of crime, “real” crimes would include the 
following acts:
Violations of human rights due to racism, sexism, 
 
■
and imperialism
Unsafe working conditions
 
■
Inadequate child care
 
■
Inadequate opportunities for employment and 
 
■
education
Substandard housing and medical care
 
■
Crimes of economic and political domination
 
■
Pollution of the environment
 
■
Price-fi xing
 
■
Police brutality
 
■
Assassinations and war-making
 
■
Violations of human dignity
 
■
Denial of physical needs and necessities, and impedi-
 
■
ments to self-determination
Deprivation of adequate food
 
■
Blocked opportunities to participate in political  
 
■
decision making
to the consensus view, society is justified in controlling 
these so-called victimless crimes because public opinion 
holds that they undermine the social fabric and threaten the 
general well-being of society. Society has a duty to protect 
all its members—even those who choose to engage in high-
risk behaviors. But are victims always people and how far 
should we go to protect non-humans? That is the topic ad-
dressed in the Thinking like a Criminologist feature.
The Conflict View of Crime
The confl ict view depicts society as a collection of diverse 
groups—business owners, workers, professionals, students—
who are in constant and continuing confl ict. Groups able to 
assert their political power use the law and the criminal jus-
tice system to advance their economic and social position. 
Criminal laws, therefore, are viewed as acts created to protect 
the haves from the have-nots. Critical criminologists often 
compare and contrast the harsh penalties exacted on the poor 
for their “street crimes” (burglary, robbery, and larceny) with 
the minor penalties the wealthy receive for their white-collar 
crimes (securities violations and other illegal business prac-
tices), though the latter may cause considerably more social 
harm. While the poor go to prison for minor law violations, 
the wealthy are given lenient sentences for even the most seri-
ous breaches of law. Rather than being class neutral, criminal 
law refl ects and protects established economic, racial, gen-
dered, and political power and privilege.
On January 10, 2011, Cody Watson, the star 
quarterback of the Los Angeles Hawks pleaded 
guilty to charges of criminal conspiracy stemming 
from his involvement in a dog-fighting ring. Wat-
son had been accused of torturing and executing 
dogs who lost their matches at his arena. While 
dog lovers demand that Watson receive the 
harshest punishment possible, others complain 
that harsh treatment is uncalled for and unfair. 
During the sentencing hearing, Watson’s lawyer 
observed that people eat steaks and cheese-
burgers all the time. “Isn’t it a bit hypocritical to consume the flesh 
of dead animals, killed for our pleasure, and condemn the behavior 
of someone accused of killing animals for another purpose?” The 
attorney went on to note, “Many people are hunters who routinely 
shoot and kill moose and deer. Why is it legal to hunt and kill de-
fenseless animals if we are so concerned about animal welfare?” He 
then pointed out such unsavory and brutal activities as fox hunting, 
raising minks and chinchillas for fur coats, bull fighting, and boil-
ing lobsters alive, all of which are perfectly legal. He addressed the 
court with this summation, “Why were these 
practices, which involve the killing of inno-
cent creatures, legal while dog fighting is con-
demned and its practitioners imprisoned? While 
some have argued that it is the method of killing 
that counts, I am not sure that the victims would 
agree.” Despite his plea, Cody Watson was sen-
tenced to 23 months in prison and suspended 
from his team.

criminal law. For example, Florida has implemented a “stand 
your ground law” that legalizes the killing of an unarmed thief 
or intruder if the person is found in the owner’s parked car; 
in other states, shooting an unarmed person merely because 
he or she was sitting in your car might be considered murder. 
Fifty years ago, a man could not be prosecuted for raping his 
wife; today, every state criminalizes marital rape. In sum, the 
defi nition of crime is more refl ective of prevailing moral val-
ues than of any objective standard of right and wrong.
The interactionist view of crime is similar to the con-
fl ict perspective; both suggest that behavior is outlawed and 
considered criminal when it offends people who hold social, 
economic, and political power. However, unlike the confl ict 
view, the interactionist perspective does not attribute capi-
talist economic and political motives to the process of de-
fi ning crime. Laws against pornography, prostitution, and 
drugs are believed to be motivated more by moral crusades 
than by economic values.
The three main views of crime are summarized in 
 Concept Summary 1.3.
Defining Crime
It is possible to take elements from each school of thought 
to formulate an integrated definition of crime, such as 
this one:
Crime is a violation of societal rules of behavior as 
interpreted and expressed by a criminal legal code 
The Interactionist View of Crime
The interactionist view of crime traces its antecedents to the 
symbolic interaction school of sociology, fi rst popularized by 
pioneering sociologists George Herbert Mead, Charles Hor-
ton Cooley, and W. I. Thomas.18 This position holds that (a) 
people act according to their own interpretations of reality, 
through which they assign meaning to things; (b) they ob-
serve the way others react, either positively or negatively; and 
(c) they reevaluate and interpret their own behavior according 
to the meaning and symbols they have learned from others.
According to this perspective, there is no objective real-
ity. People, institutions, and events are viewed subjectively 
and labeled either good or evil according to the interpreta-
tion of the evaluator. Some people might consider the hit 
film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit 
Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan as obscene, degrading, and of-
fensive, while others view the same fi lm as a laugh riot. The 
same interactions help defi ne crime:
The content of the criminal law and consequently the 
 
■
defi nition of crime often depend on human interaction 
and perceptions. Alcohol is legal, marijuana is not. It 
could easily be the other way around. Gay marriage is 
legal in some jurisdictions, illegal in others.
Deciding whether an individual act is considered a crime is 
 
■
also a function of interaction and labeling. When an argu-
ment results in the death of one of the participants, a jury 
may be asked to decide whether the act was murder, self-
defense, or merely an accidental fatality. Each person on the 
jury may have his or her own interpretation of what took 
place, and whether the act is labeled a crime and the actor a 
criminal depends on the juror’s interpretation of events.
The process in which people are defi ned or labeled as crim-
inal is also subjective. One person is viewed as an unrepentant 
hard-core offender and sent to a maximum security prison. 
Another, who has committed essentially the same crime, is 
considered remorseful and repentant and given probation in 
the community. Though their acts are similar, the treatment 
they receive is quite different. In a classic statement, sociolo-
gist Howard Becker argued, “The deviant is one to whom that 
label has successfully been applied; deviant behavior is behav-
ior people so labeled.”19 According to the interactionist view, 
the defi nition of crime refl ects the preferences and opinions 
of people who hold social power in a particular legal jurisdic-
tion. These moral entrepreneurs wage campaigns (moral cru-
sades) to control behaviors they view as immoral and wrong 
(e.g., abortion) or, conversely, to legalize behaviors they con-
sider harmless social eccentricities (e.g., carrying a handgun 
for self-protection; smoking pot). Because drug use offends 
their moral sense, it is currently illegal to purchase marijuana 
and hashish, while liquor and cigarettes are sold openly, even 
though far more people die of alcoholism and smoking than 
from drug abuse each year.20 Even the defi nition of serious 
violent offenses, such as rape and murder, depends on the 
prevailing moral values of those who shape the content of the

an innocent person to be harmed. It involved such measures 
as having the accused place his or her hand in boiling  water 
or hold a hot iron. If the wound healed, the person was 
found innocent; if the wound did not heal, the accused was 
deemed guilty. Another version, trial by combat, allowed 
the accused to challenge his accuser to a duel, with the out-
come determining the legitimacy of the accusation. Punish-
ments included public fl ogging, branding, beheading, and 
burning.
Common Law
After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, royal judges 
began to travel throughout the land, holding court in each 
shire several times a year. When court was in session, the 
royal administrator, or judge, would summon a number of 
citizens who would, on their oath, tell of the crimes and 
serious breaches of the peace that had occurred since the 
judge’s last visit. The royal judge would then decide what to 
do in each case, using local custom and rules of conduct as 
his guide. Courts were bound to follow the law established 
in previous cases unless a higher authority, such as the king 
or the pope, overruled the law.
The present English system of law came into existence 
during the reign of Henry II (1154–1189), when royal judges 
began to publish their decisions in local cases. Judges began 
to use these written decisions as a basis for their decision 
making, and eventually a fi xed body of legal rules and prin-
ciples was established. If a new rule was successfully applied 
in a number of different cases, it would become a precedent. 
These precedents would then be commonly applied in all 
similar cases—hence the term common law. Crimes such as 
murder, burglary, arson, and rape are  common-law crimes 
whose elements were initially defi ned by judges. They are 
referred to as mala in se, inherently evil and depraved. 
When the situation required it, the English Parliament en-
acted legislation to supplement the judge-made common 
law. These were referred to as statutory or mala prohibitum 
crimes, which refl ected existing social conditions. English 
common law evolved constantly to fi t specifi c incidents that 
the judges encountered. For example, in the Carriers case 
(1473), an English court ruled that a merchant who had 
been hired to transport merchandise was guilty of larceny 
(theft) if he kept the goods for his own purposes.21 Before 
the Carriers case, it was not considered a crime under the 
common law when people kept something that was volun-
tarily placed in their possession, even if the rightful owner 
had only given them temporary custody of the merchandise. 
Breaking with legal tradition, the court acknowledged that 
the commercial system could not be maintained unless the 
laws of theft were expanded. The defi nition of larceny was 
altered in order to meet the needs of a growing free enter-
prise economic system. The defi nition of theft was changed 
to include the taking of goods not only by force or stealth 
but also by embezzlement and fraud.
created by people holding social and political power. 
Individuals who violate these rules are subject to 
sanctions by state authority, social stigma, and loss of 
status.
This defi nition combines the consensus position that the 
criminal law defi nes crimes with the confl ict perspective’s 
emphasis on political power and control and the interac-
tionist concept of labeling and stigma. Thus crime, as de-
fi ned here, is a political, social, and economic function of 
modern life.
CRIME AND THE LAW
No matter which defi nition of crime we embrace, criminal 
behavior is tied to the law. It is therefore important for all 
criminologists to have some understanding of the devel-
opment of law, its objectives, its elements, and how it has 
evolved.
A Brief History of the Law
The concept of criminal law has been recognized for more 
than 3,000 years. Hammurabi (1792–1750 BCE), the sixth 
king of Babylon, created the most famous set of written laws 
of the ancient world, known today as the Code of Hammu-
rabi. Preserved on basalt rock columns, the code established 
a system of crime and punishment based on physical re-
taliation (“an eye for an eye”). The severity of punishment 
depended on class standing: if convicted of an unprovoked 
assault, a slave would be killed, whereas a freeman might 
lose a limb.
More familiar is the Mosaic Code of the Israelites (1200 
BCE). According to tradition, God entered into a covenant 
or contract with the tribes of Israel in which they agreed to 
obey his law (the 613 laws of the Old Testament, including 
the Ten Commandments), as presented to them by Moses, 
in return for God’s special care and protection. The Mosaic 
Code is not only the foundation of Judeo-Christian moral 
teachings but also a basis for the U.S. legal system. Prohibi-
tions against murder, theft, and perjury preceded by several 
thousand years the same laws found in the modern United 
States.
Though ancient formal legal codes were lost during the 
Dark Ages, early German and Anglo-Saxon societies devel-
oped legal systems featuring monetary compensation for 
criminal violations. Guilt was determined by two methods. 
One was compurgation, in which the accused person swore 
an oath of innocence with the backing of 12 to 25 oath 
helpers, who would attest to his or her character and claims 
of innocence. The second was trial by ordeal, which was 
based on the principle that divine forces would not allow

16  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
The Law in Contemporary Society
In contemporary U.S. society, the law governs almost all 
phases of human enterprise, including commerce, family 
life, property transfer, and the regulation of interpersonal 
confl ict. It contains elements that control personal relation-
ships between individuals and public relationships between 
individuals and the government. The former is known as 
civil law, and the latter is called criminal law. The law then 
can generally be divided into four broad categories:
Substantive criminal law. 
 
■
The branch of the law that 
defi nes crimes and their punishment is known as 
 substantive criminal law. It involves such issues as the 
mental and physical elements of crime, crime catego-
ries, and criminal defenses.
Procedural criminal law. 
 
■
Those laws that set out the ba-
sic rules of practice in the criminal justice system are 
procedural criminal laws. Some elements of the law 
of criminal procedure are the rules of evidence, the law 
of arrest, the law of search and seizure, questions of 
 appeal, jury selection, and the right to counsel.
Civil law. 
 
■
The set of rules governing relations between 
private parties, including both individuals and orga-
nizations (such as business enterprises or corpora-
tions), is known as civil law. The civil law is used to 
resolve, control, and shape such personal interactions 
as contracts, wills and trusts, property ownership, and 
commerce. Contained within the civil law is tort law 
discussed in Exhibit 1.1.
Public or administrative law. 
 
■
The branch of law that deals 
with the government and its relationships with indi-
viduals or other governments is known as public law. 
It governs the administration and regulation of city, 
county, state, and federal government agencies.
The four categories of the law can be interrelated. A crime 
victim may fi le a tort action against a criminal defendant and 
EXHIBIT 1.1
Types of Torts
1. Intentional torts are injuries that the person knew or should 
have known would occur through his or her actions—e.g., 
a person attacks and injures another (assault and battery) 
after a dispute.
2. Negligent torts are injuries caused because a person’s ac-
tions were unreasonably unsafe or careless—e.g., a traffic 
accident is caused by a reckless driver.
3. Strict liability torts are injuries that occur because a par-
ticular action causes damage prohibited by statute—e.g., a 
victim is injured because a manufacturer made a defective 
product.
sue for damages in a civil court. Under tort law, a crime vic-
tim may sue even if the defendant is found not guilty because 
the evidentiary standard in a civil action is less than is needed 
for a criminal conviction (preponderance of the evidence ver-
sus beyond a reasonable doubt). In some instances, the gov-
ernment has the option to pursue a legal matter through the 
criminal process, fi le a tort action, or bring the matter before 
an administrative court. White-collar crimes often involve 
criminal, administrative, and civil penalties.
Shaping the Criminal Law
Before the American Revolution, the colonies, then under 
British rule, were subject to the common law. After the colo-
nies won their independence, state legislatures standardized 
common-law crimes such as murder, burglary, arson, and 
rape by putting them into statutory form in criminal codes. 
As in England, whenever common law proved inadequate 
to deal with changing social and moral issues, the states and 
Congress supplemented it with legislative statutes. Similarly, 
statutes prohibiting such offenses as the sale and possession 
of narcotics or the pirating of DVDs have been passed to con-
trol human behavior unknown at the time the common law 
was formulated. Today, criminal behavior is defi ned primarily 
by statute. With few exceptions, crimes are removed, added, 
or modifi ed by the legislature of a particular jurisdiction.
The content of the law may also be shaped by judicial de-
cision making. A criminal statute may be no longer enforce-
able when an appellate judge rules that it is vague, deals with 
an act no longer of interest to the public, or is an unfair ex-
ercise of state control over an individual. Conversely, a judi-
cial ruling may expand the scope of an existing criminal law, 
thereby allowing control over behaviors that heretofore were 
beyond its reach. In a famous 1990 case, 2 Live Crew (made 
up of Luther Campbell, Christopher Wong Won, Mark Ross, 
and David Hobbs), a prominent rap group, found its sales re-
stricted in Florida as police began arresting children under 
18 for purchasing the band’s sexually explicit CD As Nasty as 
They Want to Be. The hit single “Me So Horny” was banned 
from local radio stations. Prosecutors tried but failed to get a 
conviction after group members were arrested at a concert. If 
members of the Crew had in fact been found guilty and the 
conviction had been upheld by the state’s highest appellate 
court, obscenity laws would have been expanded to cover 
people singing (or rapping) objectionable music lyrics.
Constitutional Limits Regardless of its source, all crimi-
nal law in the United States must conform to the rules and 
dictates of the U.S. Constitution.22 Any criminal law that 
even appears to confl ict with the various provisions and ar-
ticles of the Constitution must refl ect a compelling need to 
protect public safety or morals.23
Criminal laws have been interpreted as violating constitu-
tional principles if they are too vague or too broad to give clear 
meaning of their intent. A law forbidding adults to engage

in a random, haphazard fashion.25 Cruel ways of executing 
criminals that cause excessive pain are likewise forbidden. 
One method used to avoid “cruelty” is lethal injection. In the 
2008 case Baze and Bowling v. Rees, the Court upheld the use 
of lethal injection unless there is a “substantial risk of serious 
harm” that the drugs will not work effectively.26

called inchoate or incomplete crimes, such as attempt, solic-
itation, and conspiracy. The accompanying Profi les in Crime

in “immoral behavior” could not be enforced because it does 
not use clear and precise language or give adequate notice as 
to which conduct is forbidden.24 The Constitution also pro-
hibits laws that make a person’s status a crime. Becoming or 
being a heroin addict is not a crime, although laws can forbid 
the sale, possession, and manufacture of heroin.
The Constitution limits laws that are overly cruel and/or 
capricious. Whereas the use of the death penalty may be con-
stitutionally approved, capital punishment would be forbid-
den if it were used for lesser crimes such as rape or employed

believed to threaten societal well-being or to challenge 
their authority. For example, U.S. criminal law incor-
porates centuries-old prohibitions against the following 
behaviors harmful to others: taking another person’s 
possessions, physically harming another person, dam-
aging another person’s property, and cheating another 
person out of his or her possessions. Similarly, the law 
prohibits actions that challenge the legitimacy of the 
government, such as planning its overthrow, collaborat-
ing with its enemies, and so on.
Discouraging revenge. 
 
■
By punishing people who infringe 
on the rights, property, and freedom of others, the law 
shifts the burden of revenge from the individual to the 
state. As Oliver Wendell Holmes stated, this prevents 
“the greater evil of private retribution.”27 Although state 
retaliation may offend the sensibilities of many citizens, 
it is greatly preferable to a system in which people 
would have to seek justice for themselves.
Expressing public opinion and morality. 
 
■
Criminal law re-
fl ects constantly changing public opinions and moral 
values. Mala in se crimes, such as murder and forcible 
rape, are almost universally prohibited; however, the 
prohibition of legislatively created mala prohibitum 
crimes, such as traffi c offenses and gambling violations, 
The Substantive Criminal Law
The substantive criminal law defi nes crime and punishment. 
Each state and the federal government has its own substan-
tive criminal code, developed over many generations and 
incorporating moral beliefs, social values, and political, eco-
nomic, and other societal concerns.
Criminal laws are divided into felonies and misdemean-
ors. The distinction is based on seriousness: a felony is a 
serious offense; a misdemeanor is a minor or petty crime. 
Crimes such as murder, rape, and burglary are felonies; 
they are punished with long prison sentences or even 
death. Crimes such as unarmed assault and battery, petty 
larceny, and disturbing the peace are misdemeanors; they 
are punished with a fi ne or a period of incarceration in a 
county jail.
Regardless of their classifi cation, acts prohibited by the 
criminal law constitute behaviors considered unacceptable 
and impermissible by those in power. People who engage 
in these acts are eligible for severe sanctions. By outlawing 
these behaviors, the government expects to achieve a num-
ber of social goals:
Enforcing social control.

May 14, 2010, immediately after Santiago’s 
drug courier delivered 300 grams of heroin 
to Ortiz, Officers Williams and Venziale—
who were on duty and in uniform—stopped 
Ortiz’s vehicle and seized the shipment. 
Williams and Venziale faked arresting Ortiz 
and handcuffed him outside his car, while 
Santiago’s men looked on in disgust. The 
fake arrest made it appear as if they were 
seizing the heroin, thereby protecting Ortiz 
from retaliation. The deal was facilitated by 
a fourth conspirator, Christal Snyder, Robert 
Snyder’s wife, who passed information, via 
telephone or text message, between Ortiz 
and the police officers. In return for getting 
the 300 grams of heroin without payment to 
Santiago, Ortiz paid Williams and Venziale 
approximately $6,000, and paid Christal 
Snyder an additional amount. Unfortu-
nately for all those involved, Ortiz sold the 
stolen heroin to a drug dealer and money 
launderer who turned out to be a Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) under-
cover agent. Conspiracies of this magnitude 
are not punished lightly, and the sentences 
the conspirators face range from 44 years 
(Robert Snyder) to 212 years (“Fat Boy” 
Ortiz) in prison.

changes according to social conditions and attitudes. 
Criminal law is used to codify these changes.
Deterring criminal behavior. 
 
■
Criminal law has a social con-
trol function. It can control, restrain, and direct human 
behavior through its sanctioning power. The threat of 
punishment associated with violating the law is designed 
to prevent crimes before they occur. During the Middle 
Ages, public executions drove this point home. Today 
criminal law’s impact is felt through news accounts of 
long prison sentences and an occasional execution.
Punishing wrongdoing. 
 
■
The deterrent power of criminal 
law is tied to the authority it gives the state to sanction 
or punish offenders. Those who violate criminal law are 
subject to physical coercion and punishment.
Maintaining social order. 
 
■
All legal systems are designed to 
support and maintain the boundaries of the social sys-
tem they serve. In medieval England, the law protected 
the feudal system by defi ning an orderly system of 
property transfer and ownership. Laws in some socialist 
nations protect the primacy of the state by strictly cur-
tailing profi teering and individual enterprise. Our own 
capitalist system is also supported and sustained by 
criminal law. In a sense, the content of criminal law is 
more a refl ection of the needs of those who control the 
existing economic and political system than a represen-
tation of some idealized moral code.
Providing restoration. 
 
■
Victims deserve restitution or com-
pensation for their pain and loss. The criminal law can 
be used to restore to victims what they have lost. Be-
cause we believe in equity and justice, it is only fair that 
the guilty help repair the harm they have caused others 
by their crimes. Punishments such as fi nes, forfeiture, 
and restitution are connected to this legal goal.
Some of the elements of the contemporary criminal law 
are discussed in The Criminological Enterprise feature “The 
Elements of Criminal Law.”
The Evolution of Criminal Law
The criminal law is constantly evolving in an effort to refl ect 
social and economic conditions. Sometimes legal changes 
are prompted by highly publicized cases that generate fear 
and concern. A number of highly publicized cases of celeb-
rity stalking, including Robert John Bardo’s fatal shooting of 
actress Rebecca Schaeffer on July 18, 1989, prompted more 
than 25 states to enact stalking statutes that prohibit “the 
willful, malicious, and repeated following and harassing of 
another person.”28 Similarly, after 7-year-old Megan Kanka 
of Hamilton Township, New Jersey, was killed in 1994 by 
a repeat sexual offender who had moved into her neigh-
borhood, the federal government passed legislation requir-
ing that the general public be notifi ed of local pedophiles 
(sexual offenders who target children).29 California’s sexual 
predator law, which took effect on January 1, 1996, allows 
people convicted of sexually violent crimes against two or 
more victims to be committed to a mental institution after 
their prison terms have been served.30
The criminal law may also change because of shifts in 
culture and social conventions, refl ecting a newfound toler-
ance of behavior condemned only a few years before. In an 
important 2003 case, Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court 
declared that laws banning sodomy were unconstitutional be-
cause they violated the due process rights of citizens because 
of their sexual orientation. In its decision, the Court said:
Although the laws involved . . . here . . . do not more 
than prohibit a particular sexual act, their penalties 
and purposes have more far-reaching consequences, 
touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual 
behavior, and in the most private of places, the home. 
They seek to control a personal relationship that, 
whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the 
law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without 
being punished as criminals. The liberty protected by 
the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right 
to choose to enter upon relationships in the confi nes of 
their homes and their own private lives and still retain 
their dignity as free persons.
As a result of the decision, all sodomy laws in the 
United States are now unconstitutional and therefore 
unenforceable.31
What are some of the new laws that are being created 
and old ones that have been eliminated?
Stalking Laws More than 25 states have enacted stalking 
statutes, which prohibit and punish acts described typically 
as “the willful, malicious, and repeated following and harass-
ing of another person.”32 Stalking laws were originally formu-
lated to protect women terrorized by former husbands and 
boyfriends, although celebrities are often plagued by stalkers 
as well. In celebrity cases, these laws often apply to stalkers 
who are strangers or casual acquaintances of their victims.
Prohibiting Assisted Suicide Some laws are created 
when public opinion turns against a previously legal prac-
tice. Physician-assisted suicide became the subject of a na-
tional debate when Dr. Jack Kevorkian began practicing 
what he calls obitiatry, helping people take their own lives.33
In an attempt to stop Kevorkian, Michigan passed a statutory 
ban on assisted suicide, refl ecting what lawmakers believed 
to be prevailing public opinion.34 Kevorkian was released 
on June 1, 2007, on parole due to good behavior and now 
gives lectures on college campuses. Forty-four states now 
disallow assisted suicide either by statute or common law, 
including Michigan.35
Registering Sex Offenders Some legal changes have 
been prompted by public outrage over a particularly hei-
nous crime. One of the most well known is Megan’s Law, 
named after 7-year-old Megan Kanka of Hamilton Township,

20  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
Actus Reus
To satisfy the requirements of actus reus, 
guilty actions must be voluntary. Even 
though an act may cause harm or damage, 
it is not considered a crime if it was done 
by accident or was an involuntary act. For 
example, it would not be a crime if a mo-
torist obeying all the traffic laws hit a child 
who ran into the street. If the same motorist 
were drinking or speeding, then his action 
would be considered a vehicular crime be-
cause it was a product of negligence. Simi-
larly, it would not be considered a crime if a 
babysitter accidentally dropped a child and 
the child died. However, it would be con-
sidered manslaughter if the sitter threw the 
child down in anger or frustration and the 
blow caused the child’s death. In some cir-
cumstances of actus reus, the use of words 
is considered criminal. In the crime of sedi-
tion, the words of disloyalty constitute the 
actus reus. If a person falsely yells “fire” in 
a crowded theater and people are injured 
in the rush to exit, that person is held re-
sponsible for the injuries, because the use 
of the word in that situation constitutes an 
illegal act.
Typically, the law does not require peo-
ple to aid others in distress, such as enter-
ing a burning building to rescue people 
trapped by a fire. However, failure to act is 
considered a crime in certain instances:
Relationship of the parties based on 
 
■
status. Some people are bound by rela-
tionship to give aid. These relationships 
include parent/child and husband/wife. 
If a husband finds his wife unconscious 
because she took an overdose of sleep-
ing pills, he is obligated to save her life 
by seeking medical aid. If he fails to do 
so and she dies, he can be held respon-
sible for her death.
Imposition by statute. 
 
■
Some states have 
passed laws requiring people to give aid. 
For example, a person who observes a 
broken-down automobile in the desert 
but fails to stop and help the other par-
ties involved may be committing a crime.
Contractual relationships. 
 
■
These relation-
ships include lifeguard and swimmer, 
doctor and patient, and babysitter or 
au pair and child. Because lifeguards 
have been hired to ensure the safety 
of swimmers, they have a legal duty to 
come to the aid of drowning persons. If 
a lifeguard knows a swimmer is in dan-
ger and does nothing about it and the 
swimmer drowns, the lifeguard is legally 
responsible for the swimmer’s death.
Mens Rea
In most situations, for an act to constitute 
a crime, it must be done with criminal in-
tent, or mens rea. Intent, in the legal sense, 
can mean carrying out an act intentionally, 
knowingly, and willingly. However, the defi-
nition also encompasses situations in which 
recklessness or negligence establishes the 
required criminal intent.
The Elements of Criminal Law
Although each state and the federal gov-
ernment have unique methods of defining 
crime, there are significant uniformities 
and similarities that shape the essence of 
almost all criminal law codes. Although the 
laws of California, Texas, and Maine may all 
be somewhat different, the underlying con-
cepts that guide and shape their legal sys-
tems are universal. The question remains: 
regardless of jurisdictional boundaries, 
what is the legal definition of a crime and 
how does the criminal law deal with it?
Legal Definition of a Crime
Today, in all jurisdictions, the legal defini-
tion of a crime involves the elements of the 
criminal acts that must be proven in a court 
of law if the defendant is to be found guilty. 
For the most part, common criminal acts 
have both mental and physical elements, 
both of which must be present if the act is 
to be considered a legal crime. In order for a 
crime to occur, the state must show that the 
accused committed the guilty act, or  actus 
reus, and had the mens rea, or criminal in-
tent, to commit the act. The actus reus may 
be an aggressive act, such as taking some-
one’s money, burning a building, or shoot-
ing someone; or it may be a failure to act 
when there is a legal duty to do so, such as 
a parent neglecting to seek medical atten-
tion for a sick child. The mens rea (guilty 
mind) refers to an individual’s state of mind 
at the time of the act or, more specifically, 
the person’s intent to commit the crime.
The Criminological Enterprise
The Criminological Enterprise
Variations of Megan’s Law have been adopted by all 50 
states. Although civil libertarians have expressed concern 
that notifi cation laws may interfere with an offender’s postre-
lease privacy rights, recent research indicates that registered 
offenders fi nd value in Megan’s Law because it helps deter 
future abuse. When DNA collection is included in the law, it 
helps reduce false accusations and convictions.36
Clarifying Rape Sometimes laws are changed to clar-
ify the defi nition of crime and to quell public debate over 
the boundaries of the law. When does bad behavior cross 
New Jersey, who was killed in 1994. Charged with the crime 
was a convicted sex offender, who, unknown to the Kankas, 
lived across the street. On May 17, 1996, President Bill Clin-
ton signed Megan’s Law, which contained two components:
 1. Sex offender registration. A revision of the 1994 Jacob 
Wetterling Act, which had required the states to regis-
ter individuals convicted of sex crimes against children, 
also established a community notifi cation system.
 2. Community notifi cation. States were compelled to make 
private and personal information on registered sex of-
fenders available to the public.

change, such a circumstance was not considered rape but 
merely aggressive sex.37
Controlling Technology Changing technology and the 
ever-increasing role of technology in people’s daily lives will 
require modifi cations of the criminal law. Such technologies 
as automatic teller machines and cellular phones have al-
ready spawned a new generation of criminal acts involving 
theft of access numbers and software piracy. For example, 
a modifi cation to Virginia’s Computer Crimes Act that took 
effect in 2005 makes phishing—sending out bulk e-mail 
messages designed to trick consumers into revealing bank 
the line into criminality, and when does it remain merely 
bad behavior? An example of the former can be found in 
changes to the law of rape. In seven states, including Cali-
fornia, it is now considered rape if the victim consents to 
sex, the sex act begins, the victim changes his/her mind dur-
ing the act and tells his/her partner to stop, and the part-
ner refuses and continues. The fact that the victim initially 
consented to and participated in a sexual act does not bar 
him/her from withdrawing that consent. However, the vic-
tim must communicate the withdrawal of consent in such 
a manner that the accused knew or reasonably should have 
known that the consent was withdrawn. Before the legal 
more of the elements of the crime of which 
they have been accused. A number of dif-
ferent approaches can be taken to create 
this defense.
First, defendants may deny the actus 
reus by arguing that they were falsely ac-
cused and that the real culprit has yet to be 
identified. Second, defendants may claim 
that although they engaged in the criminal 
act of which they are accused, they lacked 
the mens rea (intent) needed to be found 
guilty of the crime.
If a person whose mental state is im-
paired commits a criminal act, it is possible 
for the person to excuse his or her criminal 
actions by claiming that he or she lacked 
the capacity to form sufficient intent to be 
held criminally responsible. Insanity, intoxi-
cation, and ignorance are types of excuse 
defenses. A defendant might argue that 
because he suffered from a mental impair-
ment that prevented him from understand-
ing the harmfulness of his acts, he lacked 
sufficient mens rea to be found guilty as 
charged.
Another type of defense is justification. 
Here the individual usually admits commit-
ting the criminal act but maintains that he 
or she should not be held criminally liable 
because the act was justified. Among the 
justification defenses are necessity, duress, 
self-defense, and entrapment. A battered 
wife who kills her mate might argue that she 
acted out of duress; her crime was commit-
ted to save her own life.
Persons standing trial for criminal of-
fenses may thus defend themselves by 
claiming that they did not commit the act 
in question, that their actions were justi-
fied under the circumstances, or that their 
behavior can be excused by their lack of 
mens rea. If either the physical or mental 
elements of a crime cannot be proven, then 
the defendant cannot be convicted.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Should the concept of the “guilty mind” 
be eliminated from the criminal law and 
replaced with a strict liability standard? 
(If you do the crime, you do the time.)
 2. Some critics believe that current crimi-
nal defenses, such as the battered wife 
defense or the insanity defense, allow 
people to go free even though they 
committed serious criminal acts and 
are actually guilty as charged. Do you 
agree?

on Criminal Law (American Casebook Series) 
(Eagan, MN: West Publishing, 2003); Joel 
 Samaha, Criminal Law (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth 
Publishing, 2001).
Criminal intent also exists if the results 
of an action, although originally unintended, 
are certain to occur. When Timothy McVeigh 
planted a bomb in front of the Murrah Federal 
Building in Oklahoma City, he did not intend 
to kill any particular person in the building. 
Yet the law would hold that McVeigh or any 
other person would be substantially certain 
that people in the building would be killed 
in the blast, and McVeigh therefore had the 
criminal intent to commit murder.
Strict Liability
Though common-law crimes require that 
both the actus reus and the mens rea must 
be present before a person can be con-
victed of a crime, several crimes defined by 
statute do not require mens rea. In these 
cases, the person accused is guilty simply 
by doing what the statute prohibits; intent 
does not enter the picture. These strict li-
ability crimes, or public welfare offenses, 
include violations of health and safety 
regulations, traffic laws, and narcotic con-
trol laws. For example, a person stopped 
for speeding is guilty of breaking the traf-
fic laws regardless of whether he or she in-
tended to go over the speed limit or did it by 
accident. The underlying purpose of these 
laws is to protect the public; therefore, in-
tent is not required.
Criminal Defenses
When people defend themselves against 
criminal charges, they must refute one or

and asbestos that exposed children, the poor, and other es-
pecially vulnerable groups to potentially serious illness.38
Legalizing Marijuana A number of states are now explor-
ing the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes. For 
example, New Jersey Senate Bill 119, signed into law on 
January 18, 2010, is typical of changes in the law. The bill 
protects “patients who use marijuana to alleviate suffering 
from debilitating medical conditions, as well as their physi-
cians, primary caregivers, and those who are authorized to 
produce marijuana for medical purposes” from “arrest, pros-
ecution, property forfeiture, and criminal and other penal-
ties.” It also provides for the creation of alternative treatment 
centers, “at least two each in the northern, central, and 
southern regions of the state. The fi rst two centers issued a 
permit in each region shall be nonprofi t entities, and centers 
subsequently issued permits may be nonprofi t or for-profi t 
account passwords, Social Security numbers, and other 
personal information—a felony. Those convicted of selling 
the data or using the data to commit another crime, such as 
identity theft, now face twice the prison time.
Protecting the Environment In response to the concerns 
of environmentalists, the federal government has passed nu-
merous acts designed to protect the nation’s well-being. The 
Environmental Protection Agency has successfully pros-
ecuted signifi cant violations of these and other new laws, 
including data fraud cases (e.g., private laboratories submit-
ting false environmental data to state and federal environ-
mental agencies); indiscriminate hazardous waste dumping 
that resulted in serious injuries and death; industrywide 
ocean dumping by cruise ships; oil spills that caused sig-
nifi cant damage to waterways, wetlands, and beaches; and 
illegal handling of hazardous substances such as pesticides 
her clients paid their smuggling fees, Sis-
ter Ping hired members of the Fuk Ching, 
Chinatown’s most feared gang, to transport 
and guard them in the United States.
In addition to running her own opera-
tion, Sister Ping helped other smugglers by 
financing large vessels designed for human 
cargo. She also ran a money transmitting 
business out of her Chinatown variety store. 
She used this business to collect smuggling 
fees from family members of her own “cus-
tomers,” and also collected ransom money 
on behalf of other alien smugglers.
Conditions aboard the smuggling vessels 
were often inhumane. The voyages were 
dangerous, and on at least one occasion 
a boat capsized while offloading people to 
a larger vessel, and 14 of her “customers” 
drowned. The Golden Venture, a smuggling 
ship Sister Ping helped finance for others, 
was intentionally grounded off the coast 
of Rockaway, Queens, when the offload-
ing vessel failed to meet it in the open sea. 
Many of the passengers could not swim, 
and 10 people drowned.
Cheng Chui Ping was indicted when 
members of the Fuk Ching gang cooperated 
with federal agents. After her indictment, 
Cheng fled to China, where she continued 
to run a smuggling operation. Hong Kong 
police arrested her at the airport. Cheng 
fought extradition but was eventually de-
livered to the United States. She was con-
victed in New York less than two years later 
on multiple counts, including money laun-
dering, conspiracy to commit alien smug-
gling, and other smuggling-related offenses, 
and was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The activities of Sister Ping illustrate 
how the law must evolve to confront newly 
emerging social problems such as illegal 
immigration. Other areas include cyber-
crime, drug importation, and terrorism. 
Unfortunately, the law is sometimes slow to 
change, and change comes only after con-
ditions have reached a crisis. How might 
laws be changed to reduce illegal immigra-
tion? Should people caught entering the 
country illegally be charged with a felony 
and imprisoned?

The Mother of All Snakeheads
Cheng Chui Ping was one of the most 
powerful underworld figures in New York. 
Known as “the Mother of all Snakeheads”—
meaning she was top dog in the human 
smuggling trade—to her friends in China-
town she was “Sister Ping.”
Cheng was an illegal immigrant herself. 
Born in 1949 in the poor farming village of 
Shengmei in Fujian province, she left her hus-
band and family behind and set out for the 
West, traveling via Hong Kong and  Canada 
before ending up in New York in 1981.
She opened a grocery store and started 
other ventures that became fronts for her 
people-trafficking business. For more than 
a decade, Cheng smuggled as many as 
3,000 illegal immigrants from her native 
China into the United States—charging 
upwards of $40,000 per person. To ensure

bear as experts in the area of crime and justice. When gov-
ernment agencies request their views of issues, their pro-
nouncements and opinions become the basis for sweeping 
social policy. The lives of millions of people can be infl u-
enced by criminological research data.
Debates over gun control, capital punishment, and 
mandatory sentences are ongoing and contentious. Some 
criminologists have successfully argued for social service, 
treatment, and rehabilitation programs to reduce the crime 
rate, but others consider them a waste of time, suggesting 
instead that a massive prison construction program coupled 
with tough criminal sentences can bring the crime rate 
down. By accepting their roles as experts on law-violating 
behavior, criminologists place themselves in a position of 
power; the potential consequences of their actions are enor-
mous. Therefore, they must be aware of the ethics of their 
profession and be prepared to defend their work in the light 
of public scrutiny. Major ethical issues include these:

What to Study?
Under ideal circumstances, when criminologists choose a 
subject for study, they are guided by their own scholarly 
interests, pressing social needs, the availability of accurate 
data, and other similar concerns. Nonetheless, in recent 
years, a great infl ux of government and institutional fund-
ing has infl uenced the direction of criminological inquiry. 
Major sources of monetary support include the Justice De-
partment’s National Institute of Justice, the National Science 
Foundation, and the National Institute of Mental Health. 
Private foundations, such as the Edna McConnell Clark 
Foundation, have also played an important role in support-
ing criminological research.
Though the availability of research money has spurred 
criminological inquiry, it has also infl uenced the direction 
research has taken. State and federal governments provide a 
signifi cant percentage of available research funds, and they 
may also dictate the areas that can be studied. In recent 
years, for example, the federal government has spent mil-
lions of dollars funding long-term cohort studies of crimi-
nal careers. Consequently, academic research has recently 
focused on criminal careers. Other areas of inquiry may be 
ignored because there is simply not enough funding to pay 
for or sponsor the research.
A potential confl ict of interest may arise when the insti-
tution funding research is itself one of the principal subjects 
of the research project. Governments may be reluctant to 
fund research on fraud and abuse of power by government 
offi cials. They may also exert a not-so-subtle infl uence on 
the criminologists seeking research funding: if criminolo-
gists are too critical of the government’s efforts to reduce 
or counteract crime, perhaps they will be barred from 
entities.” The bill allows marijuana to be prescribed for a va-
riety of illnesses ranging from severe chronic pain, nausea, 
and vomiting to terminal illnesses such as cancer. Physicians 
determine how much marijuana a patient needs and give 
written instructions to be presented to an alternative treat-
ment center. The maximum amount for a 30-day period is 
two ounces.39 According to the Drug Policy Alliance, Alaska, 
California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, 
Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, 
and Washington have created laws that effectively remove 
state-level criminal penalties for growing and/or possessing 
medical marijuana. Another ten states, plus the District of 
Columbia, have symbolic medical marijuana laws (laws that 
support medical marijuana but do not provide patients with 
legal protection under state law).40
While providing medical marijuana has strong public 
support, the federal government still criminalizes any use 
of marijuana, and federal agents can arrest users even if 
they have prescriptions from doctors in states where medi-
cal marijuana is legal. The Supreme Court ruled in 2005 in 
Gonzales v. Raich that the federal government can prosecute 
medical marijuana patients, even in states with compassion-
ate use laws.41 The Court ruled that under the Commerce 
Clause of the United States Constitution, which allows the 
United States Congress “To regulate Commerce . . . among 
the several States,” Congress may ban the use of cannabis 
even where states approve its use for medicinal purposes. 
The reasoning: because of high demand, marijuana grown 
for medical reasons would find its way into the hands of 
ordinary drug users. So while the law may change on a local 
or state level, federal rules take precedent.
Responding to Terrorism The criminal law has also un-
dergone extensive change in both substance and procedure 
in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
These acts will be discussed further in Chapter 18.
The future direction of U.S. criminal law remains un-
clear. Certain actions, such as crimes by corporations and 
political corruption, will be labeled as criminal and given 
more attention. Other offenses, such as recreational drug 
use, may be reduced in importance or removed entirely 
from the criminal law system. The globalization of crime 
will present even more challenges, as described in the Pro-
fi les in Crime feature “The Mother of All Snakeheads.”
ETHICAL ISSUES IN 
CRIMINOLOGY
A critical issue facing students of criminology involves rec-
ognizing the field’s political and social consequences. All 
too often, criminologists forget the social responsibility they

one element of the community while ignoring others. The 
question that remains is whether it is ethical for criminolo-
gists to publish biased or subjective research fi ndings, pav-
ing the way for injustice.
How to Study?
Ethics are once again questioned in cases where subjects are 
misled about the purpose of the research. When white and 
African American individuals are asked to participate in a 
survey of their behavior or an IQ test, they are rarely told 
in advance that the data they provide may later be used to 
prove the existence of signifi cant racial differences in their 
self-reported crime rates. Should subjects be told about the 
true purpose of a survey? Would such disclosures make 
meaningful research impossible? How far should crimi-
nologists go when collecting data? Is it ever permissible to 
deceive subjects to collect data? Criminologists must take 
extreme care when they select subjects for their research 
studies to ensure that they are selected in an unbiased and 
random manner.44
When criminological research efforts involve experi-
mentation and treatment, care must be taken to protect 
those subjects who have been chosen for experimental and 
control groups. For example, it may be unethical to provide 
a special treatment program for one group while depriv-
ing others of the same opportunity. Conversely, criminolo-
gists must be careful to protect subjects from experiments 
that may actually cause them harm. An examination of the 
highly publicized Scared Straight program, which brought 
youngsters into contact with hard-core prison inmates who 
gave them graphic insights into prison life (to scare them 
out of a life of crime), discovered that the young subjects 
may have been harmed by their experience. Rather than be-
ing frightened into conformity, subjects actually increased 
their criminal behavior.45
receiving further fi nancial help. This situation is even more 
acute when we consider that criminologists typically work 
for universities or public agencies and are under pressure to 
bring in a steady fl ow of research funds or to maintain the 
continued viability of their agency. Even when criminolo-
gists maintain discretion of choice, the direction of their ef-
forts may not be truly objective. The objectivity of research 
may be questioned if studies are funded by organizations 
that have a vested interest in the outcome of the research. 
For example, a study on the effectiveness of the defensive 
use of handguns to stop crime may be tainted if the funding 
for the project comes from a gun manufacturer whose sales 
may be affected by the research fi ndings. Efforts to show 
that private prisons are more effective than state correc-
tional facilities might be tainted if the researchers received 
a research grant from a corporation that maintains private

Whom to Study?
A second major ethical issue in criminology concerns who 
will be the subject of inquiries and study. Too often, crimi-
nologists focus their attention on the poor and minorities 
while ignoring the middle-class criminal who may be com-
mitting white-collar crime, organized crime, or government 
crime. Critics have charged that by “unmasking” the poor 
and desperate, criminologists have justifi ed any harsh mea-
sures taken against them. For example, a few social scien-
tists have suggested that criminals have lower intelligence 
quotients than the average citizen, and that because minor-
ity group members have lower than average IQ scores, their 
crime rates are high.42 This was the conclusion reached in 
The Bell Curve, a popular though highly controversial book 
written by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray.43 Al-
though such research is often methodologically unsound, it 
brings to light the tendency of criminologists to focus on 
 1. Understand what is meant by 
the “fi eld of criminology”
Criminology is the scientifi c ap-
 
■
proach to the study of criminal 
behavior and society’s reaction 
to law violations and violators. 
It is an academic discipline 
that uses the scientifi c method 
to study the nature, extent, 
cause, and control of criminal 
behavior. Criminology is an 
interdisciplinary science. Crimi-
nologists hold degrees in a va-
riety of fi elds, most commonly 
sociology, but also criminal jus-
tice, political science, psychol-
ogy, economics, engineering, 
and the natural sciences. Crimi-
nology is a fascinating fi eld, 
encompassing a wide variety 
of topics that have both practi-
cal application and theoretical 
importance.
 2. Be familiar with the various 
 elements of the criminological 
enterprise
The various subareas included 
 
■
within the scholarly discipline 
SUMMARY
of criminology, taken as a 
whole, defi ne the fi eld of study. 
The subarea of criminal sta-
tistics/crime measurement in-
volves calculating the amount 
of, and trends in, criminal 
activity. Sociology of law/law 
and society/socio-legal studies 
is a subarea of criminology con-
cerned with the role that social 
forces play in shaping criminal 
law and the role of criminal law 
in shaping society. Criminolo-
gists also explore the causes of

crime. Another subarea of crim-
inology involves research on 
specifi c criminal types and pat-
terns: violent crime, theft crime, 
public order crime, organized 
crime, and so on. The study of 
penology, correction, and sen-
tencing involves the treatment 
of known criminal offenders. 
Criminologists recognize that 
the victim plays a critical role 
in the criminal process and that 
the victim’s behavior is often a 
key determinant of crime.
 3. Know the difference between 
crime and deviance
Criminologists devote them-
 
■
selves to measuring, under-
standing, and controlling 
crime and deviance. Deviance 
includes a broad spectrum of 
behaviors that differ from the 
norm, ranging from the most 
socially harmful to the relatively 
inoffensive. Criminologists are 
often concerned with the con-
cept of deviance and its rela-
tionship to criminality.
 4. Discuss the three different 
views of crime
According to the consensus 
 
■
view, crimes are behaviors that 
all elements of society consider 
repugnant. This view holds that 
the majority of citizens in a so-
ciety share common values and 
agree on what behaviors should 
be defi ned as criminal. The 
confl ict view depicts criminal 
behavior as being defi ned by 
those in power to protect and 
advance their own self-interest. 
According to the interactionist 
view, those with social power 
are able to impose their values 
on society as a whole, and these 
values then defi ne criminal 
behavior.
 5. Know what constitutes the 
 different categories of law
Substantive criminal law in-
 
■
volves such issues as the mental 
and physical elements of crime, 
crime categories, and criminal 
defenses. Procedural criminal 
law sets out the basic rules of 
practice in the criminal justice 
system. It includes the rules of 
evidence, the law of arrest, the 
law of search and seizure, ques-
tions of appeal, jury selection, 
and the right to counsel. The 
civil law governs relations be-
tween private parties, including 
both individuals and organiza-
tions (such as business enter-
prises and/or corporations), and 
is used to resolve, control, and 
shape such personal interac-
tions as contracts, wills and 
trusts, property ownership, 
personal disputes (torts), and 
commerce. Administrative laws 
are enforced by governmental 
agencies such as the IRS or EPA.
 6. Discuss the different purposes 
of criminal law
The criminal law serves several 
 
■
important purposes. It repre-
sents public opinion and moral 
values. It enforces social con-
trols. It deters criminal behavior 
and wrongdoing. It punishes 
transgressors. It creates equity 
and abrogates the need for pri-
vate retribution.
 7. Trace the development 
of criminal law
The criminal law used in U.S. 
 
■
jurisdictions traces its origin to 
the English system. At fi rst the 
law of precedent was used to 
decide confl icts on a case-by-
case basis during the middle 
ages. Judges began to use these 
written decisions as a basis 
for their decision making, and 
eventually a fi xed body of legal 
rules and principles was estab-
lished. If a new rule was suc-
cessfully applied in a number of 
different cases, it would become 
a precedent. These precedents 
would then be commonly 
applied in all similar cases—
hence the term common law. In 
the U.S. legal system, lawmak-
ers have codifi ed common-law 
crimes into state and federal 
penal codes.
 8. Describe the difference between 
a felony and a misdemeanor
A felony is a serious offense that 
 
■
carries a penalty of imprison-
ment, usually for one year or 
more, and may entail loss of 
political rights. A misdemeanor 
is a minor crime usually pun-
ished by a short jail term and/
or a fi ne.
 9. Recognize the relationship 
 between the criminal law and 
the U.S. Constitution
All criminal law in the United 
 
■
States must conform to the 
rules and dictates of the U.S. 
Constitution. Criminal laws 
have been interpreted as violat-
ing constitutional principles 
if they are too vague or too 
broad to give clear meaning of 
their intent. The Constitution 
also prohibits laws that make 
a person’s status a crime. The 
Constitution limits laws that are 
overly cruel or capricious.
 10. Be familiar with the ethical 
 issues in criminology
Ethical issues arise when 
 
■
 information-gathering methods 
appear biased or exclusionary. 
These issues may cause serious 
consequences because research 
fi ndings can signifi cantly affect 
individuals and groups. Crimi-
nologists must be concerned 
about the topics they study. 
Another ethical issue in crimi-
nology revolves around the 
selection of research subjects. A 
third area of concern involves 
the methods used in conduct-
ing research.

ON
On April 25, 2009, George Zinkhan, 57, killed his wife, Marie Bruce, and two other people, Thomas Tanner 
and Ben Teague, as they exited a reunion picnic of the Town and Gown Players theater group in Athens, 
Georgia. Zinkhan then fl ed the scene and eluded a police manhunt until his body was located in a rural area 
two weeks later. It seems that Zinkhan had dug a shallow grave, covered himself with twigs and leaves, and 
then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. At fi rst the shootings seemed inexplicable, but 
news reports later indicated that George and Marie were having marital problems and that George suspected 
Tanner, a Clemson University economics professor, of being romantically involved with Marie; the third 
victim, Ben Teague, was simply “at the wrong place, at the wrong time.”

30  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
A
compiled, and analyzed by government agencies such as 
the federal government’s Bureau of Justice Statistics and the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Criminologists use 
these techniques to measure the nature and extent of crimi-
nal behavior and the personality, attitudes, and background 
of criminal offenders. It is important to understand how 
these data are collected to gain insight into how professional 
criminologists approach various problems and questions in 
their fi eld. What are these primary sources, how are they 
collected, and how valid are their fi ndings?
Official Records: The Uniform 
Crime Report
In order to understand more about the nature and extent of 
crime, criminologists use the records of government agen-
cies such as police departments, prisons, and courts. Offi cial 
record data can be used to examine crime rates and trends. 
They can also be analyzed to uncover the individual and so-
cial forces that affect crime: to study the relationship between 
crime and poverty, for example, criminologists might use in-
come and family data from the United States Census Bureau 
and then cross-reference this information with crime data 
collected by local police departments. The most important 
crime record data are collected from local law enforcement 
agencies by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and 
published yearly in their Uniform Crime Report (UCR). 
For access to the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 
web page, visit the Criminal Justice CourseMate at 
cengagebrain.com, then access the “Web Links” for this 
chapter. 
The UCR includes both crimes reported to local law en-
forcement departments and the number of arrests made by 
police agencies. The UCR is the best known and most widely 
cited source of offi cial criminal statistics.5 The FBI receives 
and compiles records from more than 17,000 police depart-
ments serving a majority of the U.S. population. Its major 
unit of analysis involves index crimes, or Part I crimes: 
murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, rob-
bery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, arson, and motor 
vehicle theft. Exhibit 2.1 defi nes these crimes.
The FBI tallies and annually publishes the number of re-
ported offenses by city, county, standard metropolitan statis-
tical area, and geographical divisions of the United States. In 
addition to recording crimes reported to the police, the UCR 
also collects data on the number and characteristics (age, 
race, and gender) of individuals who have been arrested for 
committing a crime. Included in the arrest data are people 
who have committed Part I crimes and people who have 
been arrested for all other crimes, known collectively as 
Part II crimes. This latter group includes such criminal acts 
as sex crimes, drug traffi cking, and vandalism.
Although romantic triangles have been the basis of violence 
for quite some time (when Catherine Howard cheated on 
her husband, Henry VIII, with his friend Thomas Culpeper, 
he had them both beheaded), what made this case unusual 
was the social and educational standing of those involved. 
George Zinkhan received his Ph.D. from the University of 
Michigan, became a distinguished professor of marketing 
at the University of Georgia, had authored numerous books 
and scholarly articles, and was serving as editor of a presti-
gious business journal. Marie Bruce, his wife, was a highly 
regarded attorney in Athens, Georgia. Thomas Tanner had 
earned a master’s degree in economics at Iowa State Uni-
versity in Ames, Iowa, and his Ph.D. in economics at the 
University of Georgia; he was director of the Center for Eco-
nomic Modeling at Clemson University.1
Stories such as the Athens shooting, splashed across the 
media and rehashed on nightly talk shows, help convince most 
Americans that we live in a violent society. If a well-known 
professor kills three people, including his wife, is anyone safe? 
When people read headlines about a violent crime spree, they 
begin to fear crime and take steps to protect themselves, per-
haps avoiding public places and staying at home in the eve-
ning.2 When asked if they fear walking in their neighborhood 
at night, more than one third of all American citizens say yes.3
About one quarter say they bought a gun for self-protection, 
and more than 10 percent claim they carry guns for defense.4
Are Americans justified in their fear of violent crime? 
Should they barricade themselves behind armed guards? Are 
crime rates actually rising or falling? Where do most crimes 
occur and who commits them? To answer these and similar 
questions, criminologists have devised elaborate methods of 
crime data collection and analysis. Without accurate data on 
the nature and extent of crime, it would not be possible to 
formulate theories that explain the onset of crime or to devise 
social policies that facilitate its control or elimination. Accurate 
data collection is also critical in assessing the nature and extent 
of crime, tracking changes in the crime rate, and measuring the 
individual and social factors that may infl uence criminality.
In this chapter, we review how crime data are collected 
on criminal offenders and offenses and what this informa-
tion tells us about crime patterns and trends. We also ex-
amine the concept of criminal careers and discover what 
available crime data can tell us about the onset, continua-
tion, and termination of criminality.
PRIMARY SOURCES 
OF CRIME DATA
We begin with a discussion of the primary sources of crime 
data routinely used by criminologists around the globe, 
including official records and national surveys collected,

made are expressed as raw figures. For example, an esti-
mated 15,241 persons were murdered nationwide in 2009. 
Second, crime rates per 100,000 people are computed. That 
is, when the UCR indicates that the murder rate was 5.0 in 
2009, it means about 5 people in every 100,000 were mur-
dered between January 1 and December 31 of 2009. This is 
the equation used:
Number of Reported Crimes 3 100,000 5 Rate per 100,000
Total U.S. Population
Third, the FBI computes changes in rate of crime over time. 
The 15,241 murders in 2009 was a 7.3 percent decrease 
from the 2008 fi gure, a 9 percent decrease from the 2005 
fi gure, and a 2.2 percent decrease from the 2000 estimate.6
EXHIBIT 2.1
Part I (Index) Crime Offenses
Criminal Homicide
Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter The willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by another. Deaths caused by 
negligence, attempts to kill, assaults to kill, suicides, accidental deaths, and justifiable homicides are excluded. Justifiable homicides 
are limited to (a) the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty and (b) the killing of a felon, during the 
commission of a felony, by a private citizen.
Manslaughter by Negligence The killing of another person through gross negligence. Traffic fatalities are excluded. Although 
manslaughter by negligence is a Part I crime, it is not included in the crime index.
Forcible Rape
The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will. Included are rapes by force and attempts or assaults to rape. Statutory 
offenses (no force used—victim under age of consent) are excluded.
Robbery
The taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force 
or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear.
Aggravated Assault
An unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. This type of assault 
usually is accompanied by the use of a weapon or by means likely to produce death or great bodily harm. Simple assaults are 
excluded.
Burglary/Breaking or Entering
The unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or a theft. Attempted forcible entry is included.
Larceny/Theft (except motor vehicle theft)
The unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property from the possession or constructive possession of another. Examples 
are thefts of bicycles or automobile accessories, shoplifting, pocket picking, or the stealing of any property or article that is not taken 
by force and violence or by fraud. Attempted larcenies are included. Embezzlement, con games, forgery, worthless checks, and so on 
are excluded.
Motor Vehicle Theft
The theft or attempted theft of a motor vehicle. A motor vehicle is self-propelled and runs on the surface and not on rails. Specifically 
excluded from this category are motorboats, construction equipment, airplanes, and farming equipment.
Arson
Any willful or malicious burning or attempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house, public building, motor vehicle, 
or aircraft, personal property of another, or the like.

Compiling the Uniform Crime Report
The methods used to compile the UCR are quite complex. 
Each month law enforcement agencies report the number 
of index crimes known to them. These data are collected 
from records of all crime complaints that victims, offi cers 
who discovered the infractions, or other sources reported to 
these agencies.
Whenever criminal complaints are found through in-
vestigation to be unfounded or false, they are eliminated 
from the actual count. However, the number of actual of-
fenses known is reported to the FBI whether or not anyone 
is arrested for the crime, the stolen property is recovered, or 
prosecution ensues.
The UCR uses three methods to express crime data. 
First, the number of crimes reported to the police and arrests

32  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
Serious violent crimes often produce physical evi-
 
■
dence—blood, body fl uids, fi ngerprints—that can be 
used to identify suspects.
The Profi les in Crime feature shows how one atypical 
crime was solved.
Are the Uniform Crime Reports Valid?
Despite criminologists’ continued reliance on the UCR, its 
accuracy has been suspect. The three main areas of con-
cern are reporting practices, law enforcement practices, and 
methodological problems.
Reporting Practices Some criminologists claim that vic-
tims of many serious crimes do not report these incidents to 
police; therefore, these crimes do not become part of the UCR. 
The reasons for not reporting vary. Some victims do not trust 
the police or have confi dence in their ability to solve crimes. 
Others do not have property insurance and therefore believe 
it is useless to report theft. In other cases, victims fear repri-
sals from an offender’s friends or family or, in the case of fam-
ily violence, from their spouse, boyfriend, and/or girlfriend.7
According to surveys of crime victims, less than 40 percent 
of all criminal incidents are reported to the police. Some of 
these victims justify not reporting by stating that the incident 
was “a private matter,” that “nothing could be done,” or that 
the victimization was “not important enough.”8 These fi ndings 
indicate that the UCR data may signifi cantly underreport the 
total number of annual criminal events. Some of the reasons 
crime victims decide to report crime are set out in Exhibit 2.2.
Clearance Rates In addition, each month law enforce-
ment agencies also report how many crimes were cleared.
Crimes are cleared in two ways: (1) when at least one per-
son is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for 
prosecution; or (2) by exceptional means, when some ele-
ment beyond police control precludes the physical arrest 
of an offender (i.e., the offender leaves the country). Data 
on the number of clearances involving the arrest of only 
juvenile offenders, data on the value of property stolen 
and recovered in connection with Part I offenses, and de-
tailed information pertaining to criminal homicide are also 
reported.
Traditionally, slightly more than 20 percent of all re-
ported index crimes are cleared by arrest each year, includ-
ing about 45 percent of violent crimes and 17 percent of 
property crimes.
Not surprisingly, as Figure 2.1 shows, the most serious 
crimes such as murder and rape are cleared at much higher 
rates than less serious property crimes such as larceny. What 
factors account for this clearance rate differential?
The media gives more attention to serious violent 
 
■
crimes and as a result local and state police depart-
ments are more likely to devote time and spend more 
resources in their investigations.
There is more likely to be a prior association between 
 
■
victims of violent/serious crimes and their attackers, a 
fact that aids police investigations.
Even if they did not know one another beforehand, vio-
 
■
lent crime victims and offenders interact so that identi-
fi cation is facilitated.

hospital complaining of severe stomach 
pain. After presenting fake IDs and Social 
Security cards to hospital staff, they’d allow 
doctors to examine them. In some cases, x-
rays would show actual pieces of glass in 
their stomachs (but none of it came from 
the food they purchased). Once released 
from the hospital, the couple would con-
tinue getting medical treatment for stomach 
pain. After racking up several thousand 
dollars in bills, they would file an insur-
ance claim for their extensive “pain and 
suffering.”
The scheme unraveled when the In-
surance Fraud Bureau of Massachusetts 
noticed a pattern of glass-eating claims in 
the state. The private industry organization 
eventually realized that most claims were 
being filed by the same couple and con-
tacted federal authorities who then traced 
the couple’s trail of insurance fraud across 
three states and the District of Columbia.
On March 16, 2006, the Evanos were 
indicted on mail fraud, identity theft, Social 
Security fraud, and making false statements 
on health care matters. In 2007, Ronald 
Evano pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 
63 months imprisonment; Mary Evano be-
came a fugitive until 2010 when she was 
caught and pleaded guilty.

A Pain in the Glass
From 1997 to 2005, Ronald and Mary Evano 
turned dining in restaurants into a profitable 
(albeit illegal) scam. They used the “waiter, 
there is glass in my food” ruse in restaurants 
and supermarkets stretching from Boston to 
Washington, D.C. While crude, their efforts 
paid big dividends. They allegedly swindled 
insurance companies out of $200,000 and 
conned a generous helping of food estab-
lishments and hospitals along the way. And 
to top it off, in order to look authentic, the 
Evanos actually did eat glass.
How did the Evanos pull off their scam? 
After ordering or buying food at restaurants, 
hotel bars, or supermarkets, either Ronald 
or Mary would “discover” glass in his or her 
food. They would then report the incident 
to management and fill out a report. After 
leaving the food establishment, they would 
check into the emergency room at the local 
Profiles in Crime

Law Enforcement Practices The way police departments 
record and report criminal and delinquent activity also af-
fects the validity of UCR statistics. Some police departments 
defi ne crimes loosely—reporting a trespass as a burglary or 
an assault on a woman as an attempted rape—whereas oth-
ers pay strict attention to FBI guidelines. These reporting 
practices may help explain inter-jurisdictional differences in 
crime.9 Changes in reporting can shape the crime trends re-
ported in the UCR. When Eric Baumer and Janet Lauritsen 
examined data from 1973 to 2005, their fi ndings showed 
that changes in victims’ crime-reporting practices can have 
a signifi cant impact on crime rate.10 So what may be viewed 
as a signifi cant change in crime rates may in fact represent 
a change in victims’ behavior more than in criminals’ be-
havior. Arson is seriously under-reported because many fi re 
departments do not report to the FBI, and those that do de-
fi ne many fi res that may well have been set by arsonists as 
“accidental” or “spontaneous.”11
Some local police departments make systematic errors in 
UCR reporting. They may count an arrest only after a formal 
booking procedure, although the UCR requires arrests to be 
counted if the suspect is released without a formal charge. 
One survey of arrests found an error rate of about 10 per-
cent in every Part I offense category.12
More serious allegations claim that in some cases police 
offi cials may deliberately alter reported crimes to improve 
their department’s public image. Police administrators inter-
ested in lowering the crime rate may falsify crime reports by 
EXHIBIT 2.2 
Why Do Victims Report Crime?
Seriousness
 
■
. The more serious the crime, the more likely it 
is to be reported. How do victims judge seriousness? If they 
are injured, especially if a weapon was involved, they are 
more likely to consider the incident serious and report it to 
the police. If the crime was completed, and the criminal 
got away with their wallet, purse, car, or package, reporting 
is more likely to occur.
Social support.
 
■
 The more support victims have from family, 
friends and social service agencies, the more likely they are 
to report crime.
Victim-offender relationship. 
 
■
Crimes involving strangers 
are more likely to be reported than those involving friends 
and relatives. One exception to this rule: if the crime was 
committed by an ex-husband or ex-wife, the police are more 
likely to be called than if it was committed by a stranger.
Dirty hands.
 
■
 People who are themselves involved in criminal 
activities are less likely to report crime than those whose 
“hands are clean.” The dirty hands may not be related to 
criminal activity: people who cheat on their wives, drink 
excessively, or have other skeletons in the closet are less 
likely to call the police than their less deviant peers.

ogy (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2009).

murdered them, it would be listed as six assaults or six 
murders.
Incomplete acts are lumped together with completed ones.
 
■
Important differences exist between the FBI’s defi nition 
 
■
of certain crimes and those used in a number of states.17
In addition to these issues, the complex scoring proce-
dure used in the UCR program means that many serious 
crimes are not counted. If during an armed bank robbery 
the robber strikes a teller with the butt of a handgun, then 
runs from the bank and steals an automobile at the curb, he 
has technically committed robbery, aggravated assault, and 
motor vehicle theft, which are three Part I offenses. How-
ever, the UCR only records the most serious crime; the rob-
bery would be the only one recorded in the UCR.18
The National Incident-Based 
Reporting System (NIBRS)
Clearly there must be a more reliable source for crime sta-
tistics than the UCR as it stands today. Beginning in 1982, a 
fi ve-year redesign effort was undertaken to provide more com-
prehensive and detailed crime statistics. The effort resulted in 
the National Incident-Based Reporting System  (NIBRS), a 
program that collects data on each reported crime incident. 
Instead of submitting statements of the kinds of crime that 
individual citizens report to the police and summary state-
ments of resulting arrests, the new program requires local 
police agencies to provide at least a brief account of each in-
cident and arrest, including the incident, victim, and offender 
information. Under NIBRS, law enforcement authorities pro-
vide information to the FBI on each criminal incident involv-
ing one or more of 46 specifi c offenses, including the 8 Part 
I crimes, that occur in their jurisdiction; arrest information 
on the 46 offenses plus 11 lesser offenses is also provided in 
NIBRS. These expanded crime categories include numerous 
additional crimes, such as blackmail, embezzlement, drug of-
fenses, and bribery; this allows a national database on the na-
ture of crime, victims, and criminals to be developed. Other 
collected information includes statistics gathered by federal 
law enforcement agencies, as well as data on hate or bias 
crimes. When fully implemented, NIBRS will provide:

classifying a burglary as a nonreportable trespass.13 An au-
dit of the Atlanta Police Department, which included con-
fi dential interviews with police offi cers, concluded that the 
department consistently under-reported crimes for years. 
The reason? To improve the city’s image for tourism.14 A re-
cent study of more than a hundred retired New York Police 
Department captains and higher-ranking offi cers by John 
Eterno and Eli Silverman found that police commanders, 
under intense pressure to reduce crime by hard-charging 
police commissioners such as William Bratton, manipu-
lated crime statistics in order to show that their efforts were 
working.15 How did they cheat? One method was to check 
eBay and other websites to fi nd prices for items that had 
been reported stolen that were actually lower than the value 
provided by the crime victim. They would then use the 
lower values to reduce felony grand larcenies, crimes that 
are in the UCR, to misdemeanor petit larcenies that go un-
recorded. Some commanders reported sending offi cers to 
crime scenes to persuade victims not to fi le complaints or 
alter crimes so they did not have to be reported to the FBI. 
For example, an attempted burglary must be reported, but 
an illegal trespass does not. While it is possible that the New 
York police administrators were under more pressure to re-
duce crime than their counterparts around the country, the 
fact that members of the largest police department in the 
United States may have fudged UCR data is disturbing. In 
response to the report, on January 6, 2011, the New York 
City police commissioner chose three former federal pros-
ecutors to review the department’s crime-reporting system. 
Crime rates also may be altered based on the way law en-
forcement agencies process UCR data. As the number of em-
ployees assigned to dispatching, record keeping, and criminal 
incident reporting increases, so too will national crime rates. 
What appears to be a rising crime rate may be simply an arti-
fact of improved police record-keeping ability.16
Methodological Issues Methodological issues also con-
tribute to questions pertaining to the UCR’s validity. The 
most frequent issues include the following:
No federal crimes are reported.
 
■
Reports are voluntary and vary in accuracy and 
 
■
completeness.
Not all police departments submit reports.
 
■
The FBI uses estimates in its total crime projections.
 
■
According to the “Hierarchy Rule,” in a multiple-offense 
 
■
incident, only the most serious crime is counted. Thus 
if an armed bank robber commits a robbery, assaults 
a patron as he fl ees, steals a car to get away, and dam-
ages property during a police chase, only the robbery is 
reported because it is the most serious offense. Conse-
quently, many lesser crimes go unreported.
Each act is listed as a single offense for some crimes but 
 
■
not for others. If a man robbed six people in a bar, the 
offense is listed as one robbery; but if he assaulted or

The National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCVS)
Because more than half of all victims do not report their 
experiences to the police, the UCR cannot measure all the 
annual criminal activity. To address the nonreporting issue, 
the federal government’s Bureau of Justice Statistics spon-
sors the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), 
a comprehensive, nationwide survey of victimization in the 
United States. Begun in 1973, the NCVS provides a detailed 
picture of crime incidents, victims, and trends.22
Thus far, more than 20 states have implemented their 
NIBRS program, and 12 others are in the process of fi nal-
izing their data collections. When this program is fully 
implemented and adopted across the nation, it should 
bring about greater uniformity in cross-jurisdictional re-
porting and improve the accuracy of offi cial crime data. 
Whether it can capture cases missing in the UCR remains 
to be seen.20

Criminal Justice CourseMate at cengagebrain.com,

Survey Research
The second primary source of crime/victimization measure-
ment is through surveys in which people are asked about 
their attitudes, beliefs, values, and characteristics, as well as 
their experiences with crime and victimization.
Surveys typically involve sampling, which refers to 
the process of selecting for study a limited number of 
subjects who are representative of entire groups sharing 
similar characteristics, called the population. To under-
stand the social forces that produce crime, a criminologist 
might interview a sample of 3,000 prison inmates drawn 
from the population of more than 2 million inmates in 
the United States; in this case, the sample represents the 
entire population of U.S. inmates. It is assumed that the 
characteristics of people or events in a carefully selected 
sample will be quite similar to those of the population at 
large. If the sampling was done correctly, the responses of 
the 3,000 inmates should represent the entire population 
of inmates.
In some circumstances, criminologists may want the 
survey to be representative of all members of society; this 
is referred to as a cross-sectional survey. A survey of all 
students who attend the local public high school would be 
considered a cross-sectional survey since all members of 
the community, both rich and poor, male and female, go to 
high school. Cross-sectional surveys are a useful and cost-
effective technique for measuring the characteristics of large 
numbers of people:
Because questions and methods are standardized for all 
 
■
subjects, uniformity is unaffected by the perceptions or 
biases of the person gathering the data.
Carefully drawn samples enable researchers to gen-
 
■
eralize their fi ndings from small groups to large 
populations.
Though surveys measure subjects at a single point 
 
■
in their life span, questions can elicit information on 
subjects’ past behavior as well as expectations of future 
behaviors.21
Victim surveys provide information not only about 
criminal incidents that have occurred, but also about 
the individuals who are most at risk of falling victim to 
crime, and where and when they are most likely to be-
come victimized. Data from recent NCVS surveys will 
be used in Chapter 3 to draw a portrait of the nature 
and extent of victimization in the United States.
CONNECTIONS 
How the NCVS Is Conducted U.S. Census Bureau per-
sonnel interview household members in a nationally repre-
sentative sample of approximately 38,000 households (about 
68,000 people). People are interviewed twice a year, so that 
approximately 136,000 interviews of persons age 12 or older 
are conducted annually. Households stay in the sample for 
three years. New households are rotated into the sample on 
an ongoing basis. The NCVS collects information on crimes 
suffered by individuals and households, whether or not 
those crimes were reported to law enforcement. It estimates 
the proportion of each crime type reported to law enforce-
ment, and it summarizes the reasons that victims give for re-
porting or not reporting. In 1993, the survey was redesigned 
to provide detailed information on the frequency and nature 
of the crimes of rape, sexual assault, personal robbery, ag-
gravated and simple assault, household burglary, theft, and 
motor vehicle theft.
The survey provides information about victims (age, 
sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, income, and educa-
tional level), offenders (sex, race, approximate age, and

36  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
It now faces some important challenges. A recent analysis 
conducted by the National Research Council found that its 
effectiveness has been undermined by budget limitations.25
In order to keep going in light of tight resources, the 
survey’s sample size and methods of data collection have 
been altered. Although the current sample size is still valid 
for its purpose, victimization is still a relatively rare event 
so that when contacted many respondents do not have in-
cidents to report. Consequently the NCVS now has to com-
bine multiple years of data in order to comment on change 
over time, which is less desirable than an annual measure of 
year-to-year change.
Reflecting these issues, in 2006 significant changes 
were made to the way the NCVS is collected so that vic-
timization estimates are not totally comparable to previ-
ous years. The methodological changes included: a new 
sampling method, a change in the method of handling 
first-time interviews with households, and a change in 
the method of interviewing. Some selected areas were 
dropped from the sample while others were added. Fi-
nally, computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) re-
placed paper and pencil interviewing (PAPI). While these 
issues are critical, there is no substitute available that 
provides national information on crime and victimization 
with extensive detail on victims and the social context of 
the criminal event.
Self-Report Surveys
While the NCVS is designed to measure victimization di-
rectly and criminal activity indirectly, participants in self-
report surveys are asked to describe, in detail, their recent 
and lifetime participation in criminal activity. Self-reports 
are generally given anonymously in groups, so that the 
people being surveyed are assured that their responses will 
remain private and confi dential. Secrecy and anonymity are 
essential to maintain the honesty and validity of responses. 
Self-report survey questions might ask:
How many times in the past year have you taken some-
 
■
thing worth more than $50?
How many times in the past year did you hurt someone 
 
■
so badly that they needed medical care?
How many times in the past year did you vandalize or 
 
■
damage school property?
How many times in the past year did you use marijuana?
 
■
While most self-report studies have focused on juvenile 
delinquency and youth crime, they can also be used to ex-
amine the offense histories of select groups such as prison 
inmates, drug users, and even police offi cers.26
In addition to crime-related items, most self-report sur-
veys contain questions about attitudes, values, and behav-
iors. There may be questions about participants’ substance 
victim–offender relationship), and the crimes (time and 
place of occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and 
economic consequences). Questions also cover the experi-
ences of victims with the criminal justice system, self-pro-
tective measures used by victims, and possible substance 
abuse by offenders. Supplements are added periodically 
to the survey to obtain detailed information on topics like 
school crime.
NCVS: Advantages and Problems The greatest advantage 
of the NCVS over offi cial data sources such as the UCR is that 
it can estimate the total amount of annual crimes and not only 
those that are reported to police. Nonreporting is a signifi -
cant issue: typically, less than half of all violent victimizations 
and about 40 percent of all property crimes are reported to 
the police. As a result, the NCVS data provides a more com-
plete picture of the nation’s crime problem. Also, because 
some crimes are signifi cantly underreported, the NCVS is an 
indispensable measure of their occurrence. Take for example 
the crimes of rape and sexual assault, of which  slightly more 
than half of incidents are reported to police. The UCR shows 
that in 2009 slightly more than 88,000 rapes or attempted 
rapes occurred, as compared to the 126,000 uncovered by 
the NCVS. In addition, the NCVS helps us  understand why 
crimes are not reported to police and whether the type and 
nature of the criminal event infl uences whether the police 
will ever know it occurred. With the crime of rape, research 
shows that victims are much more likely to report rape if it is 
accompanied by another crime such as robbery than they are 
if it is a stand-alone event. Offi cial data alone cannot provide 
that type of information.23
While its utility and importance is unquestioned, the 
NCVS may also suffer from some methodological problems. 
As a result, its fi ndings must be interpreted with caution. 
Among the potential problems are the following:
Over reporting due to victims’ misinterpretation of 
 
■
events. A lost wallet may be reported as stolen, or an 
open door may be viewed as a burglary attempt.
Under-reporting due to the embarrassment of reporting 
 
■
crime to interviewers, fear of getting in trouble, or sim-
ply forgetting an incident.
Inability to record the personal criminal activity of 
 
■
those interviewed, such as drug use or gambling; mur-
der is also not included, for obvious reasons.
Sampling errors, which produce a group of respondents 
 
■
who do not represent the nation as a whole.
Inadequate question format that invalidates responses. 
 
■
Some groups, such as adolescents, may be particularly 
susceptible to error because of question format.24
The Future of the NCVS For the past 30 years, the NCVS 
(along with the UCR) has served as one of the two major 
indicators of crime and victimization in the United States.

abuse, false ID use, shoplifting or larceny under $50, fi ght-
ing, marijuana use, or damage to the property of others. 
Furthermore, self-reports dispute the notion that crimi-
nals and delinquents specialize in one type of crime or an-
other; offenders seem to engage in a mixed bag of crime and 
deviance.29
Validity of Self-Reports Critics of self-report studies fre-
quently suggest that it is unreasonable to expect people to 
candidly admit illegal acts. This is especially true of those 
with official records, who may be engaging in the most 
criminality. At the same time, some people may exagger-
ate their criminal acts, forget some of them, or be confused 
about what is being asked. Some surveys contain an over-
abundance of trivial offenses, such as shoplifting small items 
or using false identifi cation to obtain alcohol, often lumped 
together with serious crimes to form a total crime index. 
Consequently, comparisons between groups can be highly 
misleading.
The “missing cases” phenomenon is also a concern. Even 
if 90 percent of a school population voluntarily participate 
in a self-report study, researchers can never be sure whether 
the few who refuse to participate or are absent that day com-
prise a signifi cant portion of the school’s population of per-
sistent high-rate offenders. Research indicates that offenders 
with the most extensive prior criminality are also the most 
likely “to be poor historians of their own crime commission 
rates.”30 It is also unlikely that the most serious chronic of-
fenders in the teenage population are willing to cooperate 
abuse history, arrest history, and their 
family relations, such as “Did your 
parents ever strike you with a stick or 
a belt?” By correlating the responses, 
criminologists are able to analyze the 
relationship between personal factors 
and criminal behaviors. Statistical 
analysis of the responses can be used 
to determine whether people who re-
port being abused as children are also 
more likely to use drugs as adults. 
When psychologist Christiane Brems 
and her associates used this approach 
to collect data from 274 women and 
556 men receiving drug detoxifi cation 
services, they found that 20 percent 
of men and more than 50 percent of 
women reported childhood physi-
cal or sexual abuse. Individuals who 
report an abuse history also reported 
earlier age of onset of drinking, more 
problems associated with use of 
 alcohol/drugs, more severe psychopa-
thology, and more lifetime arrests.27
Self-Report Patterns One of the most important sources 
of self-report data is the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study, 
which researchers at the University of Michigan Institute for 
Social Research (ISR) have been conducting annually since 
1978. This national survey typically involves more than 
2,500 high school seniors.28 The MTF is considered the na-
tional standard to measure substance abuse trends among 
American teens.

Self-report surveys can be used to assess the “dark figures of crime,” offenses that would 
never otherwise be counted in the official crime data. Self-reports have been used to measure 
trends and patterns in teen substance abuse, something that official data would never be able 
to assess.
MTF data on patterns and trends in teenage substance 
abuse will be analyzed in Chapter 14. Despite public 
perception to the contrary, teen drug use seems to be 
on the decline.

with criminologists administering  self-report tests.31 Institu-
tionalized youths, who are not generally represented in the 
self-report surveys, are not only more delinquent than the 
general youth population, but are also considerably more 
misbehaving than the most delinquent youths identifi ed in 
the typical self-report survey.32 Consequently, self-reports 
may measure only nonserious, occasional delinquents while 
ignoring hardcore chronic offenders who may be institu-
tionalized and unavailable for self-reports.

Criminologists suspect that a few high-rate offenders 
are responsible for a disproportionate share of all se-
rious crime. Results would be badly skewed if even a 
few of these chronic offenders were absent or refused to 
participate in schoolwide self-report surveys. For more 
on chronic offenders, see the sections at the end of this 
chapter.
There is also evidence that reporting accuracy differs 
among racial, ethnic, and gender groups. It is possible that 
some groups are more worried about image than others and 
less willing to report crime, deviance, and/or victimization 
for fear that it would make them or their group look bad. 
Take these cases, for instance:
One recent study found that while girls were usually 
 
■
more willing than boys to disclose drug use, Latino girls 
signifi cantly under-report their drug usage. Such gender 
and ethnic-based differences in reporting might pro-
vide a skewed and inaccurate portrait of criminal and/
or delinquent activity—in this case, the self-report data 
would falsely show that Latino girls use fewer drugs 
than other females.33
African Americans have been found to be less willing to 
 
■
report traffi c stops than Caucasians, a phenomenon that 
prevents accurate assessments of racial profi ling by po-
lice. Because of this reluctance to report stops that have 
occurred, it is possible that the “driving while black” 
phenomenon is worse than research surveys indicate.34
To address these criticisms, various techniques have been 
used to verify self-report data.35 The “known group” method 
compares youths who are known to be offenders with those 
who are not to see whether the former report more delin-
quency. Research shows that when kids are asked if they have 
ever been arrested or sent to court, their responses accurately 
refl ect their true life experiences.36 New techniques are also 
being developed to more accurately measure past behaviors. 
The life event calendar (LEC), for example, is an instrument 
designed to help people recall the timing and sequencing 
of life experiences and events such as committing crime. 
The LEC is organized in a calendar format (Table 2.1), with 
time demarcations positioned horizontally and life events 
vertically. It is hoped that the LEC technique now allows 
researchers to extract and record data in a manner that mim-
ics the way people store and organize their memories.37
While these studies are supportive, self-report data must 
be interpreted with some caution. Asking subjects about 
their past behavior may capture more serious crimes but 
miss minor criminal acts—that is, people remember armed 
robberies and rapes better than they do minor assaults and 
altercations.38 In addition, some classes of offenders, such 
as substance abusers, may have a tough time accounting for 
their prior misbehavior.39
Evaluating the Primary Sources 
of Crime Data
The UCR, NCVS, and self-reports are the standard sources of 
data used by criminologists to track trends and patterns in the 
crime rate. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. The 
UCR contains information on the number and characteristics 
of people arrested, information that the other data sources lack. 
Some recent research indicates that for serious crimes, such as 
drug traffi cking, arrest data can provide a meaningful measure 
of the level of criminal activity in a particular neighborhood 
 environment, which other data sources cannot provide. It is 
also the source of information on particular crimes such as mur-
der, which the other data sources cannot provide.40 It remains 
the standard unit of analysis upon which most criminological 
research is based. However, UCR data omits many criminal in-
cidents victims choose not to report to police, and it is subject 
to the reporting caprices of individual police departments.
The NCVS includes unreported crime and important 
information on the personal characteristics of victims. How-
ever, the data consist of estimates made from relatively limited 
samples of the total U.S. population, so that even narrow fl uc-
tuations in the rates of some crimes can have a major impact 
on fi ndings. It also relies on personal recollections that may 
be inaccurate. The NCVS does not include data on important 
crime patterns, including murder and drug abuse.
Self-report surveys can provide information on the per-
sonal characteristics of offenders—such as their attitudes, 
values, beliefs, and psychological profi les—that is unavail-
able from any other source. Yet, at their core, self-reports 
rely on the honesty of criminal offenders and drug abusers, a 
population not generally known for accuracy and integrity.

CHAPTER 2 | The Nature and Extent of Crime  39
Although their tallies of crimes are certainly not in sync, 
the crime patterns and trends they record are often quite 
similar (see Concept Summary 2.1).41 Each of the sources of 
crime data agree about the personal characteristics of seri-
ous criminals (such as age and gender) and where and when 
crime occurs (such as urban areas, nighttime, and summer 
months). In addition, the problems inherent in each source 
are consistent over time. Therefore, even if the data sources 
are incapable of providing an exact, precise, and valid count 
of crime at any given time, they are reliable indicators of 
changes and fl uctuations in yearly crime rates.
SECONDARY SOURCES 
OF CRIME DATA
In addition to these main sources of crime data, a number 
of other techniques are used by criminologists to gather data 
on specifi c crime problems and trends, to examine the lives 
of criminal offenders, and to assess the effectiveness of crime 
control efforts:
CONCEPT SUMMARY 2.1
Data Collection Methods
Uniform Crime Report
Data are collected from records from police departments 
 
■
across the nation, crimes reported to police, and arrests.
Strengths of the UCR are that it measures homicides and 
 
■
arrests, and it is a consistent, national sample.
Weaknesses of the UCR are that it omits crimes not reported 
 
■
to police, omits most drug usage, and contains reporting 
errors.
National Crime Victimization Survey
Data are collected from a large national survey.
 
■
Strengths of the NCVS are that it includes crimes not 
 
■
reported to the police, uses careful sampling techniques, 
and is a yearly survey.
Weaknesses of the NCVS are that it relies on victims’ 
 
■
memory and honesty, and it omits substance abuse.
Self-Report Surveys
Data are collected from local surveys.
 
■
Strengths of self-report surveys are that they include 
 
■
unreported crimes, substance abuse, and offenders’ personal 
information.
Weaknesses of self-report surveys are that they rely on the 
 
■
honesty of offenders and they omit offenders who refuse to 
or who are unable to participate and who may be the most 
deviant.
Cohort Research
Cohort research involves observing a group of people who 
share a like characteristic over time. Researchers might se-
lect all girls born in Albany, New York, in 1970 and then 
follow their behavior patterns for 20 years. The research 
data might include their school experiences, arrests, hos-
pitalizations, and information about their family life (di-
vorces, parental relations). The subjects might be given 
repeated intelligence and physical exams; their diets might 
be monitored.
Data may be collected directly from the subjects dur-
ing interviews and meetings with family members. Crimi-
nologists might also examine records of social organizations, 
such as hospitals, schools, welfare departments, courts, 
police departments, and prisons. School records contain 
data on students’ academic performance, attendance, intelli-
gence, disciplinary problems, and teacher ratings. Hospitals 
record incidents of drug use and suspicious wounds, which 
may be indicative of child abuse. Police fi les contain reports 
of criminal activity, arrest data, personal information on sus-
pects, victim reports, and actions taken by police offi cers. 
Court records enable researchers to compare the personal 
characteristics of offenders with the outcomes of their court 
appearances, conviction rates, and types of sentence. Prison 
records contain information on inmates’ personal character-
istics, adjustment problems, disciplinary records, rehabilita-
tion efforts, and length of sentence served. If the cohort is 
carefully drawn, it may be possible to determine which life 
experiences produce criminal careers.
Because it is extremely difficult, expensive, and 
time-consuming to follow a cohort over time, another 
approach is to take an intact cohort from the past and 
collect data from their educational, family, police, and 
hospital records. This format is known as a retrospective 
cohort study.42 For example, a cohort of girls who were 
in grade school in 1970 could be selected from school 
attendance records. A criminologist might then acquire 
their police and court records over the following four 
decades to determine (a) which ones developed a crimi-
nal record and (b) whether school achievement predicts 
adult criminality.
Some critical criminological research has been based 
on cohort studies, such as the important research con-
ducted by University of Pennsylvania criminologist 
Marvin Wolfgang and his colleagues. Their findings 
have been instrumental in developing an understand-
ing about the onset and development of a criminal 
career. Wolfgang’s cohort research, which is discussed 
later in this chapter, helped identify the chronic crimi-
nal offender.

forced to rely on what is known as a quasi-experimental de-
sign. A criminologist may want to measure whether kids 
who were abused as children are more likely to become 
violent as teens. Of course, it is impossible to randomly 
select youth, assign them to two independent groups, and 
then purposely abuse members of one group in order to 
gauge their reactions. To get around this dilemma, a crimi-
nologist may follow a group of kids who were abused and 
compare them with a matched group who though simi-
lar in every other respect were never abused in order to 
discover if the battered kids were more likely to become 
violent teens. Because the subjects were not randomly as-
signed, it is impossible to know whether there was some-
thing in the abused group that made them more crime 
prone than the unabused kids.
True criminological experiments are relatively rare be-
cause they are diffi cult and expensive to conduct; they in-
volve manipulating subjects’ lives, which can cause ethical 
and legal roadblocks; and they require long follow-up peri-
ods to verify results. Nonetheless, they have been an impor-
tant source of criminological data.
Observational and Interview Research
Sometimes criminologists focus their research on relatively 
few subjects, interviewing them in depth or observing 
them as they go about their activities. This 
research often results in the kind of in-
depth data absent in large-scale surveys. 
In one such effort, Claire Sterk-Elifson fo-
cused on the lives of middle-class female 
drug abusers.43 The 34 interviews she 
conducted provide insight into a group 
whose behavior might not be captured in 
a large-scale survey. Sterk-Elifson found 
that these women were introduced to co-
caine at fi rst “just for fun”: “I do drugs,” 
one 34-year-old lawyer told her, “because 
I like the feeling. I would never let drugs 
take over my life.”44 Unfortunately, many 
of these subjects succumbed to the power 
of drugs and suffered both emotional and 
fi nancial stress.
Another common criminological 
method is to observe criminals fi rsthand 
to gain insight into their motives and ac-
tivities. This may involve going into the 
field and participating in group activi-
ties; this was done in sociologist William 
Whyte’s famous study of a Boston gang, 
Street Corner Society.45 Other observers 
conduct field studies but remain in the 
background, observing but not being part 
of the ongoing activity.46
Experimental Research
Sometimes criminologists are able to conduct controlled 
experiments to collect data on the cause of crime. They 
may wish to directly test whether (a) watching a violent 
TV show will (b) cause viewers to act aggressively. This 
test  requires experimental research. To conduct experimen-
tal research, criminologists manipulate or intervene in the 
lives of their subjects to see the outcome or the effect of the 
 intervention. True experiments usually have three elements: 
(1) random selection of subjects, (2) a control or compari-
son group, and (3) an experimental condition. Using this 
approach to fi nd out the effects of viewing violent media 
content, a criminologist might have one group of randomly 
chosen subjects watch an extremely violent and gory fi lm 
(Resident Evil or The Human Centipede) while another ran-
domly selected group viewed something more mellow (The 
Princess Diaries or Happy Feet). If the subjects who watched 
the violent film were significantly more aggressive than 
those who watched the nonviolent fi lm, an association be-
tween media content and behavior would be supported. 
The fact that both groups were randomly selected would 
prevent some preexisting condition from invalidating the 
results of the experiment.
Because it is sometimes impossible to randomly select 
subjects or manipulate conditions, criminologists may be

Criminologists observe people in their home setting and interview them in order to gain 
insight into their behavior, attitudes, and values. Some specialize in gang research. Here, 
members of the Pico Norte 19th Street Gang flash their hand signs in El Paso, Texas. The 
gang, an offshoot of the Los Juaritos gang from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, has become the 
most notorious gang in the city, with some 60 active members. The gang is known for 
being a “clean gang”—not involved in drug trafficking or part of older gangs that have 
become involved in large organized crime schemes. Some 650 known gang members, 
the majority of Hispanic origin, operate in El Paso. When interviewed, members say they 
joined the gang to gain respect among their peers and to protect themselves against other 
gangs; they consider the group a part of their family. Interviews can provide information 
unavailable with other research methods.

sources including calls for service data, crime or incident 
reports, witness statements, suspect interviews, tip informa-
tion, telephone toll analysis, or Internet activity.
Data mining permits proactive or “risk-based” deploy-
ment of police resources, a procedure that can increase 
public safety by optimizing the allocation of resources. For 
example, Richmond, Virginia, has experienced frequent 
random gunfi re on New Year’s Eve that has long presented 
a challenge to local law enforcement agencies. Through 
the use of data mining, the Richmond Police Department 
identifi ed and targeted locations associated with increased 
random gunfi re during the previous New Year’s Eve holiday 
and deployed additional police resources to these areas. The 
results were extremely positive: there was a 49 percent re-
duction in the number of random gunfi re complaints, with 
a concomitant increase in seized weapons of 246 percent. 
Using data mining to target resources, the Richmond Police 
Department required fewer police personnel than originally 
anticipated, which permitted the release of approximately 
50 sworn employees. Data mining yielded a cost savings 
of approximately $15,000 during the eight-hour initiative. 
The Richmond Police Department’s initiative demonstrated 
the ability to do more with less through the use of data 
mining and risk-based deployment strategies in the public 
safety arena.49
Crime Mapping
Criminologists are now using crime maps to create graphic 
representations of the spatial geography of crime. Com-
puterized crime maps allow criminologists to analyze and 
correlate a wide array of data to create immediate, detailed 
visuals of crime patterns. The most simple maps display 
crime locations or concentrations and can be used, for ex-
ample, to help law enforcement agencies increase the ef-
fectiveness of their patrol efforts. More complex maps can 
be used to chart trends in criminal activity. For example, 
criminologists might be able to determine if certain neigh-
borhoods in a city have signifi cantly higher crime rates than 
others—so-called hot spots of crime.50 Figure 2.2 illustrates 
a crime map generated in Providence, Rhode Island. How 
mapping is used by police is the topic of the accompanying 
Policy and Practice in Criminology feature.
CRIME TRENDS
Crime is not new to this century.51 Studies have indicated 
that a gradual increase in the crime rate, especially in vio-
lent crime, occurred from 1830 to 1860. Following the Civil 
War, this rate increased significantly for about 15 years. 
Then, from 1880 up to the time of the First World War, 
Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review
Meta-analysis involves gathering data from a number of 
previous studies. Compatible information and data are ex-
tracted and pooled together. When analyzed, the grouped 
data from several different studies provide a more powerful 
and valid indicator of relationships than the results provided 
from a single study. A systematic review is another widely 
accepted means of evaluating the effectiveness of public 
policy interventions. It involves collecting the fi ndings from 
previously conducted scientifi c studies that address a par-
ticular problem, appraising and synthesizing the evidence, 
and using the collective evidence to address a particular sci-
entifi c question.
Through these well-proven techniques, criminologists 
can identify what is known and what is not known about 
a particular problem and use the fi ndings as a fi rst step for 
carrying out new research. Criminologists David Farrington 
and Brandon Welsh used a systematic review and a meta-
analysis to study the effects of street lighting on crime.47 Af-
ter identifying and analyzing 13 relevant studies, Farrington 
and Welsh found evidence showing that neighborhoods 
that improve their street lighting do in fact experience a 
 reduction in crime rates. Their fi ndings should come as no 
great surprise: it seems logical that well-lit streets would 
have fewer robberies and thefts because (a) criminals could 
not conceal their efforts under the cover of darkness, and 
(b) potential victims could take evasive action if they saw 
a suspicious-looking person lurking about. However, their 
analysis produced an unusual finding: improving light-
ing caused the crime rate to go down during the day just 
as much as it did during the night! Obviously, the crime-
 reducing effect of streetlights had little to do with illumi-
nating the streets. Farrington and Welsh speculate that 
improved street lighting increases community pride and 
solidarity, and the result of this newfound community 
 solidarity is a lowered crime rate, during both the day 
and evening.
Data Mining
A relatively new criminological technique, data mining, 
uses multiple advanced computational methods, including 
artifi cial intelligence (the use of computers to perform logi-
cal functions), to analyze large data sets usually involving 
one or more data sources. The goal is to identify signifi cant 
and recognizable patterns, trends, and relationships that 
are not easily detected through traditional analytical tech-
niques alone.48 Criminologists then use this information for 
various purposes, such as the prediction of future events or 
behaviors.
Data mining might be employed to help a police depart-
ment allocate resources to combat crime based on offense 
patterns. To determine if such a pattern exists, a criminolo-
gist might employ data mining techniques with a variety of

with the possible exception of the years immediately preced-
ing and following the war, the number of reported crimes 
decreased. After a period of readjustment, the crime rate 
steadily declined until the Depression (about 1930), when 
another crime wave was recorded. As measured by the UCR, 
crime rates increased gradually following the 1930s until 
the 1960s, when the growth rate became much greater. The 
homicide rate, which had actually declined from the 1930s 
to the 1960s, also began a sharp increase that continued 
through the 1970s.
By 1991, police recorded about 14.6 million crimes. 
Since then, the number of crimes has been in decline; in 
2009, about 10.5 million crimes were reported to the police, 
a drop of 4 million recorded crimes from the peak despite 
an increasing national population.
During the same period, the number of victimizations 
reported to the NCVS also showed a signifi cant downturn. 
For example, in 2009, the NCVS recorded about 4 million 
violent crimes (rapes or sexual assaults, robberies, aggravated 
assaults, and simple assaults), 15.5 million property crimes 
(burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, and household thefts), 
and 133,000 personal thefts (picked pockets and snatched 
purses).52 This number has dropped by half since 1991, when 
43 million crimes were reported, including more than 10 mil-
lion violent crimes. The victimization rate for violence was 
more than 50 incidents per 1,000 population, while today it

past two decades. Preliminary UCR data indicate that this 
trend continued between 2009 and 2010 when the num-
ber of violent crimes dropped 6 percent and the number of 
property crimes dropped about 3 percent.
is less than 20; in 1991, victims reported more than 300 in-
cidents of property crime per 1,000 population, while today 
it is less than 150.53 Between 2008 and 2009 all crime types 
recorded signifi cant declines.
Violent and property crime rates in 2009 
remained at the lowest levels recorded since 
1973, the first year that such data were col-
lected. The rate of every major violent and 
property crime measured by the Bureau of Jus-
tice Statistics fell between 2000 and 2009. The 
overall violent crime rate fell 39 percent, and 
the property crime rate declined by 29 percent 
during the last 10 years.
Figure 2.3 illustrates serious violent crime 
rate trends over that past 30 years as measured 
by four separate indicators and readily shows 
the welcome drop in the overall crime rate.
The crime drop has affected both violent 
and property crimes. About 1.3 million vio-
lent crimes are now being reported to police, 
a rate of about 450 per 100,000 inhabitants. 
As Table 2.2 shows, the number and rate of 
violent crimes have dropped signifi cantly for 
almost two decades, while the population has 
increased by 50 million. Table 2.3 shows simi-
lar trends for the number and rate of property 
crimes (larceny, motor vehicle theft, and ar-
son), which have also declined for most of the 
Chatham, Georgia, police department was 
baffled by a series of nine kidnappings 
and rapes. CATCH staff mapped the crime 
locations along with other variables and 
created a timeline. Because the victims 
were kidnapped and then taken to isolated 
locations and assaulted, the mapping was 
complex. Using movement-analysis tech-
niques, CATCH team members projected 
probable locations where the offender 
had targeted the victims and provided a 
list of recommendations for disrupting 
the series. These forecasts and recom-
mendations backed up conclusions by 
the Savannah authorities, who initiated 
a public awareness campaign about the 
crimes. The Savannah-Chatham Police 
Department arrested the offender following 
an attack in an area targeted for increased 
surveillance.
CRITICAL THINKING
Do you believe that it is possible to predict 
where crime will take place in the future? It 
sounds like the film Minority Report using 
computers. Is there a downside to this type 
of prediction?

based on next-event forecasting, which 
differs from geographic profiling. Geo-
graphic profiling analyzes the locations of

occurred to predict where the next crime 
will happen. So far CATCH has had several

screen TVs, and digital cameras. On the 
other hand, new targets may increase crime 
rates; subway crime increased in New York 
when thieves began targeting people carry-
ing iPods and expensive cell phones such 
as the iPhone.
Abortion
There is evidence that the recent drop in 
the crime rate is linked to the availability of 
legalized abortion. In 1973, Roe v. Wade 
legalized abortion nationwide, and the drop 
in the crime rate began approximately 18 
years later, in 1991. Crime rates began to 
decline when the first groups of potential 
offenders affected by the abortion decision 
began reaching the peak age of criminal 
activity. It is possible that the link between 
crime rates and abortion is the result of two 
mechanisms: (1) selective abortion on the 
part of women most at risk to have children 
who would engage in criminal activity, and 
(2) improved child rearing or environmental 
circumstances caused by better maternal, 
familial, or fetal care because women are 
having fewer children.
Gun Availability
The availability of firearms may influence 
the crime rate: as the number of guns in the 
population increases, so do violent crime 
rates. Handguns are especially dangerous if 
they fall into the hands of teens. Surveys of 
high school students indicate that between 
6 and 10 percent carry guns at least some 
of the time. Guns also cause escalation in 
the seriousness of crime. As the number 
of gun-toting students increases, so too 
does the seriousness of violent crime as a 
schoolyard fight turns into murder.
Gangs
Another factor that affects crime rates is the 
explosive growth in teenage gangs. Surveys 
indicate that there are about 800,000 gang 
members in the United States. Data col-
lected by the National Youth Gang Center 
show that gang members are responsible 
for a large proportion of all violent offenses 
committed during the adolescent years.
Boys who are members of gangs are 
far more likely to possess guns than non-
gang members; criminal activity increases 
when kids join gangs. Gangs involved in 
the urban drug trade recruit juveniles be-
cause they work cheaply, are immune from 
heavy criminal penalties, and are daring 
and willing to take risks. Arming themselves 
for protection, these drug-dealing children 
present a menace to their community, 
which persuades non–gang-affiliated neigh-
borhood adolescents to arm themselves for 
protection. The result is an arms race that 
produces an increasing spiral of violence. 
As gangs become more organized, so too 
does their level of violence and drug deal-
ing. Without gang influence, the crime rate 
might be much lower.
Drug Use
Some experts tie increases in the violent 
crime rate between 1985 and 1993 to the 
crack epidemic, which swept the nation’s 
largest cities, and to drug-trafficking gangs 
that fought over drug turf. These well-armed 
gangs did not hesitate to use violence to con-
trol territory, intimidate rivals, and increase 
market share. As the crack epidemic sub-
sided, so too did the violence rates in New 
York City and other metropolitan areas where 
crack use was rampant. A sudden increase 
in drug use on the other hand may be a har-
binger of future increases in the crime rate, 
especially if guns are easily obtained and fall 
into the hands of gang members.
Media
Some experts argue that violent media 
can influence the direction of crime rates. 
As the availability of media with a violent 
theme skyrocketed with the introduction of 
home video players, DVDs, cable TV, com-
puter and video games, and so on, so too 
did teen violence rates. Efforts to curb vio-
lence on TV may help account for a declin-
ing crime rate.
Factors that Influence Crime Trends
Crime experts have identified a variety of 
social, economic, personal, and demo-
graphic factors that influence crime rate 
trends. Although crime experts are still 
uncertain about how these factors impact 
these trends, directional change seems to 
be associated with changes in crime rates.
Age Structure
As a general rule, the crime rate follows the 
proportion of teens in the population: more 
kids, more crime! Crime rates skyrocketed 
in the 1960s when the baby boomers be-
came teens and the 13 to 19 population 
grew rapidly. Crime rate drops since 1993 
can be explained in part by an aging so-
ciety: the elderly commit relatively few 
crimes.
Immigration
Immigration has a suppressor effect on 
crime. Research shows that immigrants are 
less crime prone than the general popula-
tion, so that as the number of immigrants 
increases per capita crime rates decline. 
During the past two decades, cities with 
the largest increases in immigration have 
experienced the largest decreases in crime 
rates, especially homicides and robberies.
Economy
The general public believes that crime rates 
increase as the economy turns down and 
unemployment rises. However, there is little 
correlation between these indicators of eco-
nomic prosperity and crime rates. Unem-
ployed people do not suddenly join gangs 
or commit armed robberies. Criminals are 
usually unemployed or underemployed and 
therefore not affected by short-term eco-
nomic conditions.
Crime rates may, however, be influ-
enced by other types of economic factors. 
The decline in the burglary rate over the 
past decade may be explained in part by 
the abundance and subsequent decline 
in price of commonly stolen merchandise 
such as iPods, laptops, cell phones, flat

are now being released each year, and 
many return to their communities without 
marketable skills or resources. The num-
ber of releasees will rise for the foresee-
able future as more and more sentences 
bestowed during the high crime rate 1990s 
are completed. The recidivism rate of pa-
roled inmates is quite high, averaging 
about 40 percent for those released from 
federal penitentiaries and 67 percent for 
those released from state custody. Inmates 
reentering society may have a significant 
effect on local crime rates.
Social and Cultural Change
International scholar Martin Kilias notes 
that crime trends can be influenced by 
sudden “breaches”—that is, new oppor-
tunities for offending that open as a result 
of changes in the technological or social 
environment. As an example he shows 
that violence among men has decreased 
since 1850 in some countries because the 
concept of “honor” has lost most of its im-
portance. There is evidence, he finds, that 
it was common in the past for a small ar-
gument to end in a duel or at least a brawl 
if a person’s personal or family honor was 
impugned or questioned. Today, honor-
based killings can still be found, such 
as areas of Turkey where any critical re-
mark about a person’s reputation is dealt 
with by aggression against the source of 
“rumors.”
While maintaining honor and saving 
face are still important factors in contem-
porary society, other cultural macro-level 
conditions such as the number of single-
parent families, high school dropout rates, 
racial conflict, and the prevalence of teen 
pregnancies also exert a powerful influence 
on crime rates. High levels of race- and 
ethnicity-based income inequality have 
been shown to have an impact on crime 
rates. Areas where there is both within and 
between group inequality experience more 
violent crimes than neighborhoods in which 
most residents are doing equally well.
CRITICAL THINKING
While crime rates have been declining in 
the United States, they have been increas-
ing in Europe. Is it possible that factors that 
correlate with crime rate changes in the 
United States have little utility in predicting 
changes in other cultures? What other fac-
tors may increase or reduce crime rates?

Medical Technology
Some crime experts believe that the pres-
ence and quality of health care can have 
a significant impact on murder rates. Mur-
der rates might be up to five times higher 
than they are today without medical break-
throughs in treating victims of violence 
developed over the past 40 years. The big 
breakthrough occurred in the 1970s when 
technology developed to treat injured sol-
diers in Vietnam was applied to trauma care 
in the nation’s hospitals. Since then, fluc-
tuations in the murder rate can be linked 
to the level and availability of emergency 
medical services.
Justice Policy
Some law enforcement experts have sug-
gested that a reduction in crime rates may 
be attributed to adding large numbers of 
police officers and using them in aggres-
sive police practices that target “quality of 
life” crimes such as panhandling, graffiti, 
petty drug dealing, and loitering. By show-
ing that even the smallest infractions will 
be dealt with seriously, aggressive police 
departments may be able to discourage po-
tential criminals from committing more se-
rious crimes. Cities employing aggressive, 
focused police work may be able to lower 
homicide rates in the area.
It is also possible that tough laws impos-
ing lengthy prison terms on drug dealers 
and repeat offenders can affect crime rates. 
The fear of punishment may inhibit some 
would-be criminals and place a significant 
number of potentially high-rate offenders 
behind bars, lowering crime rates. As the 
nation’s prison population expanded, the 
crime rate has fallen.
However, justice policy can sometimes 
backfire and actually lift crime rates. Take 
for instance the long-term effect of incar-
ceration. The imprisonment boom has 
resulted in more than 2 million people be-
hind bars. While this policy may take some 
dangerous offenders off the street, eventu-
ally most get out. About 600,000 inmates

40 million youths between the ages of 10 and 18. Accord-
ing to MTF findings, this group accounts for more than 
100 percent of all theft offenses reported in the UCR. More 
than 3 percent of the students said they used a knife or a 
gun in a robbery. At this rate, high school students commit 
1.2 million armed robberies per year. In comparison, the 
UCR tallied about 200,000 armed robberies for all age 
groups. The MTF indicates that a great deal of crime is hid-
den from public view and not reported by victims.
The factors that help explain the upward and downward 
movement in crime rates, such as the one we have experi-
enced for the past two decades, are discussed in The Crimi-
nological Enterprise feature “Factors that Infl uence Crime 
Trends” on page 45.
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS
It is risky to speculate about the future of crime trends be-
cause current conditions can change rapidly. It’s possible that 
crime rates may rise in the future if the unemployment rate 
remains high for a prolonged period of time and the cur-
rent generation of teens lose hope of ever gaining legitimate 
employment. Gang membership may increase and those in-
volved in gangs may remain in them longer. However, as

Even teenage criminality, a source of national concern, 
has been in decline during this period. The proportion of 
serious violent crimes committed by juveniles has generally 
declined since 1993. Victims perceived that between one-
fi fth and one-quarter of violent crimes were committed by 
juveniles. According to the victim’s perception of the age of 
the offender, the number of serious violent offenses commit-
ted by persons ages 12 to 17 declined more than 60 percent 
since 1993.
Trends in Self-Reporting
Self-report results appear to be more stable than the UCR 
and NCVS data indicate. When the results of recent self-
report surveys are compared with various studies conducted 
over a 20-year period, a uniform pattern emerges. The use of 
drugs and alcohol increased markedly in the 1970s, leveled 
off in the 1980s, increased until the mid-1990s, and have 
been in decline ever since. Theft, violence, and damage-
related crimes seem more stable. Although a self-reported 
crime wave has not occurred, neither has there been any 
visible reduction in self-reported criminality.
Table 2.4 contains data from the most recent MTF 
survey.
It should be noted that if the MTF data are accurate, 
the crime problem is much greater than FBI and NCVS 
data would lead us to believe. There are approximately

CHAPTER 2 | The Nature and Extent of Crime  47
economist Steven Levitt comments, if teens commit more 
crime in the future, their contribution may be offset by the 
aging of the population, which will produce a large number 
of senior citizens and elderly, a group with a relatively low 
crime rate.54 The immigrant population is also increasing, 
another factor that may reduce crime rates.
Such prognostications are reassuring, but there is, of 
course, no telling what changes are in store that may infl u-
ence crime rates. Technological developments such as e-
commerce on the Internet have created new classes of crime 
that are not recorded by any of the traditional methods of 
crime measurement. It’s possible that some crimes such as 
fraud, larceny, prostitution, obscenity, vandalism, stalking, 
and harassment have increased over the Internet while fall-
ing under the radar of offi cial crime data. For example, the 
number of people arrested for prostitution has declined 
17 percent during the past decade. It’s possible that (a) there 
are simply fewer prostitutes, (b) police are less likely to ar-
rest prostitutes than they were a decade ago, or (c) pros-
titution is booming, but because it’s being conducted via 
the Internet, prostitutes are more likely now to avoid de-
tection (though as the accompanying Profi les in Crime fea-
ture indicates, some do get caught). Nonetheless, the rate 
of traditional violent crimes has also decreased signifi cantly, 
indicating that the growth of high-tech crimes cannot alone 
explain the crime drop in America.
The topic of e-crime will be discussed in detail in Chap-
ter 15. It seems logical that falling common-law crime 
rates may refl ect increases in e-crime.
CONNECTIONS
CRIME PATTERNS
Criminologists look for stable crime rate patterns to gain 
insight into the nature of crime. The cause of crime may 
be better understood by examining the rate. If, for exam-
ple, criminal statistics consistently show that crime rates are 
higher in poor neighborhoods in large urban areas, then the 
cause of crime may be related to poverty and neighborhood 
decline. If, in contrast, crime rates are spread evenly across 
society, and rates are equal in poor and affl uent neighbor-
hoods, this would provide little evidence that crime has an 
economic basis. Instead, crime might be linked to socializa-
tion, personality, intelligence, or some other trait unrelated 
to class position or income. In this section, we examine 
traits and patterns that may infl uence the crime rate.
At least nine of the women were minors 
under the age of 18 when they were enticed, 
persuaded, or coerced into lives of prostitu-
tion. The youngest of these girls was only 12 
when she was prostituted by the ring.
Rather than confine their activities to one 
state, the ring operated in several, including 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illi-
nois, Arkansas, Virginia, Georgia, Maryland, 
Tennessee, the District of Columbia, Califor-
nia, Florida, Nevada, Texas, and Louisiana. 
Investigators found that this prostitution 
enterprise had been operating in the Harris-
burg area for almost a decade. Despite their 
colorful nicknames, those indicted and con-
victed were cruel, violent, and amoral:

While prostitution arrests and prosecutions 
are in decline, that does not mean all ma-
jor traffickers escape detection. In 2009, a 
large Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, based pros-
titution ring was broken up by federal, state, 
and county investigators that may be typical 
of the large-scale prostitution rings operat-
ing in the United States. The group ran a 
highly organized ring that set predetermined 
prices for sexual services and then wired 
the money they earned to co-conspirators in 
other states. The conspirators engaged in ex-
tensive interstate travel and transportation of 
women and girls for prostitution and openly 
discussed their illegal activities. One of the 
men was overheard bragging to another, 
“I love pimping.” The men used violence 
and intimidation to recruit and control the 
women and girls being prostituted by them; 
one described beating prostitutes so brutally 
that “both my hands were swelled up.”

point (85 degrees) when it may be too hot 
for any physical exertion.56 However, crimi-
nologists continue to debate this issue:
 Some believe that crime rates rise with 
 
■
temperature (i.e., the hotter the day, the 
higher the crime rate).57
 Others have found evidence that the 
 
■
curvilinear model is correct.58
 Some research shows that a rising 
 
■
temperature will cause some crimes 
to continually increase (e.g., domestic 
assault), while others (e.g., rape) will 
decline after temperatures rise to an ex-
tremely high level.59
If in fact there is an association between 
temperature and crime, how can it be ex-
plained? The relationship may be due to the 
stress and tension caused by extreme tem-
peratures. The human body generates stress 
hormones (adrenaline and testosterone) in 
response to excessive heat; hormonal activ-
ity has been linked to aggression.60
One way to combat the temperature–
crime association: turn off your air condi-
tioner! James Rotton and Ellen Cohn found that assaults in 
air-conditioned settings increased as the temperature rose; as-
saults in non-air-conditioned settings declined after peaking 
at moderately high temperatures.61
Regional Differences Large urban areas have by far the 
highest violence rates; rural areas have the lowest per capita 
crime rates. Exceptions to this trend are low population re-
sort areas with large transient or seasonal populations, such 
as Atlantic City, New Jersey. Typically, the western and south-
ern states have had consistently higher crime rates than the 
Midwest and Northeast (Figure 2.4). This pattern has con-
vinced some criminologists that regional cultural values in-
fl uence crime rates; others believe that regional differences 
can be explained by economic differences.
Use of Firearms
Firearms play a dominant role in criminal activity. Accord-
ing to the UCR, about two-thirds of all murders and 40 per-
cent of robberies involve fi rearms; most of these weapons 
are handguns.
Because of these fi ndings, there is an ongoing debate over 
gun control. International criminologists Franklin Zimring and 
Gordon Hawkins believe the proliferation of handguns and 
the high rate of lethal violence they cause is the single most 
signifi cant factor separating the crime problem in the United 
States from the rest of the developed world.62 Differences be-
tween the United States and Europe in nonlethal crimes are 
only modest at best—and getting smaller over time.63
In contrast, some criminologists believe that personal gun 
use can actually be a deterrent to crime. Gary Kleck and Marc 
Crime rates are higher in urban areas, in the south, and during the summer months. 
Two exceptions to this trend are murders and robberies, which occur frequently in 
December and January. Here, in a security camera photo provided by the Nashville, 
Tennessee, Police Department, two men with guns rob a convenience store in Nashville, 
December 12, 2006. Police say the men killed two people and critically injured another.
AP Images/Nashville Police Department 
The Ecology of Crime
Patterns in the crime rate seem to be linked to temporal and 
ecological factors. Some of the most important of these are 
discussed here.
Day, Season, and Climate Most reported crimes occur 
during the warm summer months of July and August. Dur-
ing the summer, teenagers, who usually have the highest 
crime levels, are out of school and have greater opportunity 
to commit crime. People spend more time outdoors during 
warm weather, making themselves easier targets. Similarly, 
homes are left vacant more often during the summer, mak-
ing them more vulnerable to property crimes. Two excep-
tions to this trend are murders and robberies, which occur 
frequently in December and January (although rates are also 
high during the summer).
Crime rates also may be higher on the fi rst day of the 
month than at any other time. Government welfare and So-
cial Security checks arrive at this time, and with them come 
increases in such activities as breaking into mailboxes and 
accosting recipients on the streets. Also, people may have 
more disposable income at this time, and the availability of 
extra money may relate to behaviors associated with crime 
such as drinking, partying, gambling, and so on.55
Temperature Weather effects (such as temperature swings) 
may have an impact on violent crime rates. Traditionally, the 
association between temperature and crime was thought to 
resembles an inverted U-shaped curve: crime rates increase 
with rising temperatures and then begin to decline at some

CHAPTER 2 | The Nature and Extent of Crime  49
Social Class, Socioeconomic 
Conditions, and Crime
It makes sense that crime is inherently a lower-class phe-
nomenon. After all, people at the lowest rungs of the so-
cial structure have the greatest incentive to commit crimes, 
and people who are undergoing fi nancial diffi culties are the 
ones most likely to become their targets.65 It seems logical 
Gertz have found that as many as 400,000 people per year use 
guns in situations in which they later claim that the guns al-
most “certainly” saved lives. Even if these estimates are off by 
a factor of 10, it means that armed citizens may save 40,000 
lives annually. Although Kleck and Gertz recognize that guns 
are involved in murders, suicides, and accidents, which claim 
more than 30,000 lives per year, they believe their benefi t as a 
crime prevention device should not be overlooked.64

be more likely to formally arrest and prosecute lower-class 
citizens, especially racial and ethnic minorities, while giving 
those in the middle and upper classes more lenient treat-
ment, such as handling their law violations with a warning. 
Police behavior and not actual behavior may account for the 
lower class’s over-representation in offi cial statistics and the 
prison population. This explanation is supported by self-
report data that does not fi nd a direct relationship between 
social class and crime.68 The conclusion: if the poor have 
more extensive criminal records than the wealthy, this dif-
ference is attributable to differential law enforcement and 
not to class-based behavior differences. That is, police may 
be more likely to arrest lower-class offenders and treat the 
affl uent more leniently.69
Evaluating the Class–Crime Association While the 
true relationship between class and crime is diffi cult to de-
termine, the weight of recent evidence seems to suggest 
that serious, offi cial crime such as rape, murder, and bur-
glary is more prevalent among the lower classes, whereas 
less serious and self-reported crime is spread more evenly 
throughout the social structure.70 Income inequality, pov-
erty, and resource deprivation are all associated with the 
most serious violent crimes, including homicide and as-
sault.71 Members of the lower class are more likely to 
suffer psychological abnormality, including high rates of 
anxiety and conduct disorders, conditions that may pro-
mote criminality.72
Research consistently shows that 
community-level indicators of social 
inequality are signifi cantly related to 
crime rates. People living in commu-
nities that lack economic and social 
opportunities are more likely to com-
mit crime than their more affluent 
neighbors.73 Community poverty has 
a significant influence on residents’ 
psychological well-being: people liv-
ing in substandard areas feel relatively 
deprived, a condition that produces 
anger, strain, and frustration.74 Fam-
ily life is disrupted, and law-violating 
youth groups thrive in a climate that 
undermines adult supervision.75 So 
while poverty alone cannot explain 
crime, debate is far from over. Al-
though crime rates may be higher in 
lower-class areas, poverty alone can-
not explain why a particular individ-
ual becomes a chronic violent criminal 
(if it could, the crime problem would 
be much worse than it is now). Nev-
ertheless, socioeconomic conditions 
may infl uence some people to break 
the law.76
that people who are outside the economic mainstream 
and therefore are unable to obtain desired goods and ser-
vices legally will resort to illegal activities—such as selling 
narcotics—to obtain a share of the “American Dream”: if 
you can’t afford a car, steal it; if you cannot afford designer 
clothes, become a drug dealer. Instrumental crimes are 
those committed by indigent people to compensate for 
the lack of legitimate economic opportunity. People living 
in poverty are also believed to engage in disproportionate 
amounts of expressive crimes, such as rape and assault, 
as a result of their anger and frustration against society, a 
condition fueled by alcohol and drug abuse, common in 
impoverished areas.66
When measured with UCR data, offi cial statistics indi-
cate that crime rates in inner-city, high-poverty areas are 
generally higher than those in suburban or wealthier areas.67 
Surveys of prison inmates consistently show that prisoners 
were members of the lower class and unemployed or under-
employed in the years before their incarceration. These are 
empirical indicators of a class–crime connection.
While the association between class and crime seems 
logical, it is not accepted by all criminologists. An alter-
native explanation is that the relationship between offi cial 
crime and social class is a function of law enforcement 
practices, not actual criminal behavior patterns. Police may 
devote more resources to poor areas, and consequently ap-
prehension rates may be higher there. Similarly, police may 
While most criminologists consider crime a lower-class phenomenon, others believe it is spread 
more evenly across the social structure. Official crime data show that the most serious crimes 
are committed in lower-class environments. Here, on April 15, 2010, police officers with the 
Los Angeles Police Department’s gang unit search two young men in the Nickerson Gardens 
Housing Project in the South East police division of Los Angeles, California. The housing project 
is a traditional street gang neighborhood controlled by the Bounty Hunter Bloods, associated 
with the nationwide Bloods gang. Lower-class areas are more likely to experience gang activity 
than more affluent neighborhoods.

will turn their anger toward the high cost of govern-
ment, thereby convincing state offi cials to lower taxes 
and cut back on justice spending. When crime rates 
increase, as they inevitably do, there are renewed calls 
for police protection. Because these cycles parallel 
but do not necessarily coincide with economic con-
ditions, crime rates and crime prevention spending 
may be high when the economy is working and in 
decline during an economic downturn or vice versa. 
The economy has been in turmoil for quite some time, 
both during the boom years in the 1990s and after the 
markets crashed and unemployment peaked in the 
new millennium.
One reason for all this confusion may simply be meth-
odological: measuring the associations among variables 
such as jobs, the economy, and crime is often quite diffi -
cult. There are signifi cant economic differences at the state, 
county, community, and neighborhood level. While people 
in one area of the city are doing quite well, their neighbors 
living in another part of town may be suffering unemploy-
ment. Crime rates may even vary by street, an association 
that is diffi cult to detect.
Criminologist Shawn Bushway has recently argued that 
there is no natural or optimum rate of crime and that crime 
rates go up and down in long, slow trajectories that vary 
considerably from period to period. These trajectories may 
be influenced by massive changes in the economy since 
1960. Women have joined the workforce in large numbers; 
union influence has shrunk; manufacturing has moved 
overseas; and computers and the Internet have changed the 
way that resources are created and distributed. As manu-
facturing has moved overseas, less-educated, untrained 
male workers have been frozen out of the job market. These 
workers may fi nd themselves competing in illegal markets: 
selling drugs may be more profi table than working in a fast 
food restaurant. Similarly, people may fi nd prostitution and/
or sex work more lucrative relative to minimum wage jobs  
in the legitimate market. When the economy turns, drug 
dealers do not suddenly quit the trade and get a job with GE 
or IBM. Hence, argues Bushway, labor markets, rather than 
unemployment rates, are the economic engine that shapes 
the crime rate and creates incentives for individuals to par-
ticipate in illegal activities.81
So the association between economic factors and crime 
is quite complex and cannot be explained with a simple lin-
ear relationship (i.e., the higher the unemployment rate, the 
more crime).82 Class and economic conditions may affect 
some crimes and some people differently than they affect 
others. Some subgroups in the population (e.g., women, Af-
rican Americans) seem more deeply infl uenced by economic 
factors than others (e.g., men, whites).83 There may also be 
cultural factors involved: while class is related to crime rates 
in the United States, the effect may be less significant in 
other cultures, especially those that place less emphasis on 
the accumulation of material goods.84
Crime and the Economy One of the enduring contro-
versies in the class–crime association is the effect of uneco-
nomic conditions such as unemployment on crime. The 
association seems logical: if class and crime are related, 
crime rates should peak during tough economic times when 
people are out of work and the poor are hard-pressed to fi nd 
jobs. However, research shows that aggregate crime rates 
and aggregate unemployment rates seem weakly related. In 
other words, crime rates sometimes rise during periods of 
economic prosperity and fall during periods of economic 
decline.77
There are four diverging views on the association be-
tween the economy and crime rates:
Bad economy means higher crime rates.
 
■
 When the econ-
omy turns down, people who are underemployed or 
unemployed will become motivated to commit property 
crimes to obtain desperately needed resources. In con-
trast, a strong economy, such as the one we had in the 
1990s, will bring the crime rate down. When people 
perceive that the economy is doing well, i.e., there 
is positive consumer sentiment, the rate of property 
crimes such as burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft 
declines.78
Good economy means higher crime rates.
 
■
 A good economy 
requires that more people be hired, including teens. 
Unfortunately, kids with after-school jobs are more 
likely to engage in antisocial activities. Since teens com-
mit more crimes than adults, high teenage employment 
will actually increase the overall crime rate.79
Bad economy means lower crime rate.
 
■
 During an eco-
nomic downturn, unemployed parents are at home to 
supervise children and guard their possessions. When 
people are unemployed, they have less money on hand 
and purchase fewer things worth stealing. They may 
even sell their valuables to raise cash, reducing suitable 
targets for burglars and thieves.
Crime and the economy are unrelated.
 
■
 It is also pos-
sible that the state of the economy and crime rates are 
unrelated. It seems unlikely that middle-class work-
ers will suddenly join gangs or become bank robbers 
when they lose their jobs. Research conducted by Gary 
Kleck and Ted Chiricos shows that the relationship 
between unemployment and crime rates is insignifi -
cant. Unemployed people are neither likely to stick 
up gas stations, banks, and drug stores, nor are they 
more likely to engage in nonviolent property crimes, 
including shoplifting, residential burglary, theft of mo-
tor vehicle parts, and theft of automobiles, trucks, and 
motorcycles.80 Also, conditions that infl uence crime 
rates may counter economic trends. For example, 
when crime rates are high, voters complain, prompt-
ing state and local offi cials to pour money into police, 
courts, and correctional services, thereby lowering the 
crime rate. Since such measures are costly, when crime 
rates decline and fear temporarily abates, tax payers

collectively make up about 6 percent of the total U.S. popu-
lation, they account for about 25 percent of serious crime 
arrests and 17 percent of arrests for all crimes. As a general 
rule, the peak age for property crime is believed to be 16, 
and for violence, 18. In contrast, adults 45 and over, who 
make up about a third of the population, account for only 7 
percent of serious crime arrests. The elderly are particularly 
resistant to the temptations of crime; they make up more 
than 14 percent of the population and less than 1 percent 
of arrests. Elderly males 65 and over are predominantly ar-
rested for alcohol-related matters (e.g., public drunkenness 
and drunk driving) and elderly females for larceny (e.g., 
shoplifting). The elderly crime rate has remained stable for 
the past 20 years.89
Aging Out of Crime Most criminologists agree that peo-
ple commit less crime as they age.90 Crime peaks in ado-
lescence and then declines rapidly thereafter. According to 
criminologist Robert Agnew, this peak in criminal activity 
can be linked to essential features of adolescence in modern, 
industrial societies. Because adolescents are given most of 
the privileges and responsibilities of adults in these cultures, 
they also experience:
A reduction in supervision
 
■
An increase in social and academic demands
 
■
Participation in a larger, more diverse, peer-oriented 
 
■
social world
An increased desire for adult privileges
 
■
A reduced ability to cope in a legitimate manner and 
 
■
increased incentive to solve problems in a criminal 
manner91
Adding to these incentives is the fact that young peo-
ple, especially the indigent and antisocial, tend to dis-
count the future.92 They are impatient, and because their 
future is uncertain, they are unwilling or unable to delay 
gratification. As they mature, troubled youths are able 
to develop a long-term life view and resist the need for 
immediate gratification.93 Aging out of crime may be a 
function of the natural history of the human life cycle.94
Deviance in adolescence is fueled by the need for money 
and sex and reinforced by close relationships with peers 
who defy conventional morality. At the same time, teen-
agers are becoming independent from parents and other 
adults who enforce conventional standards of morality and 
behavior. They have a new sense of energy and strength 
and are involved with peers who are similarly vigorous 
and frustrated.
In adulthood, people strengthen their ability to delay 
gratifi cation and forgo the immediate gains that law viola-
tions bring. They also start wanting to take responsibility for 
their behavior and to adhere to conventional mores.95 Get-
ting married, raising a family, and creating long-term fam-
ily ties provide the stability that helps people desist from 
crime.96
If class and crime are unrelated, then the causes of 
crime must be found in factors experienced by mem-
bers of all social classes—psychological impairment, 
family confl ict, peer pressure, school failure, and so on. 
Theories that view crime as a function of problems ex-
perienced by members of all social classes are reviewed 
in Chapter 7.
CONNECTIONS 
Age and Crime
There is general agreement that age is inversely related to 
criminality. Criminologists Travis Hirschi and Michael Gott-
fredson state, “Age is everywhere correlated with crime. Its 
effects on crime do not depend on other demographic cor-
relates of crime.”85 Regardless of economic status, marital 
status, race, sex, and so on, younger people commit crime 
more often than their older peers. Research shows that on 
average, kids who are persistent offenders begin commit-
ting crime in their childhood, rapidly increase their offend-
ing activities in late adolescence and then begin a slowdown 
in adulthood. Early starters tend to commit more crime and 
are more likely to continue to be involved in criminality 
over a longer period of time.86 While it has been long as-
sumed that most kids commit crime in groups, and that 
peer support encourages offending in adolescence, the most 
recent research disputes the “co-offending” hypothesis and 
suggests the great bulk of youth crime is a solo act.87 Kids 
who assume an outlaw persona fi nd that their antisocial 
acts bring them increased social status among peers who 
admire their risk-taking behaviors. Young criminals may 
be looking for an avenue of behavior that improves their 
peer group standing.88 Hence, they commit more crime 
in adolescence.
Hirschi and Gottfredson have used their views on the 
age–crime relationship as a basis for their General 
Theory of Crime. This important theory holds that the 
factors that produce crime change little after birth and 
that the association between crime and age is constant. 
For more on this view, see the section on the General 
Theory of Crime in Chapter 9.

Offi cial statistics tell us that young people are arrested at 
a disproportionate rate to their numbers in the population; 
victim surveys generate similar fi ndings for crimes in which 
assailant age can be determined. Whereas youths under 18

against a woman.99 This perspective is known as the chiv-
alry hypothesis, which holds that much female criminality 
is hidden because of the culture’s generally protective and 
benevolent attitude toward women.100 In other words, po-
lice are less likely to arrest, juries are less likely to convict, 
and judges are less likely to incarcerate female offenders.
Although these early writings are no longer taken seri-
ously, some criminologists still believe that gender-based 
traits are a key determinant of crime rate differences. 
Among the suspected differences include physical strength 
and hormonal infl uences. According to this view, male sex 
hormones (androgens) account for more aggressive male be-
havior, and gender-related hormonal differences explain the 
gender gap in the crime rate.101
Gender differences in the crime rate may be a function 
of androgen levels because these hormones cause areas 
of the brain to become less sensitive to environmental 
stimuli, making males more likely to seek high levels 
of stimulation and to tolerate more pain in the process. 
Chapter 5 discusses the biosocial causes of crime and 
reviews this issue in greater detail.
CONNECTIONS
Socialization and Development Although there are few 
gender-based differences in aggression during the fi rst few 
years of life, girls are socialized to be less aggressive than 
boys and are supervised more closely by parents.102 Dif-
ferences in aggression become noticeable between ages 3 
and 6 when children are fi rst socialized into organized peer 
groups such as the daycare center or school. Males are more 
likely then to display physical aggression while girls display 
relational aggression—excluding disliked peers from play-
groups, gossiping, and interfering with social relationships.
Males are taught to be more aggressive and assertive 
and are less likely to form attachments to others. They of-
ten view their aggression as a gender-appropriate means to 
gain status and power, either by joining deviant groups and 
gangs or engaging in sports. Even in the middle-class sub-
urbs, they may seek approval by knocking down or running 
through peers on the playing fi eld, while females literally 
cheer them on. The male search for social approval through 
aggressive behavior may make them more susceptible to 
criminality, especially when the chosen form of aggression is 
antisocial or illegal. Recent research by Jean Bottcher found 
that young boys perceive their roles as being more dominant 
than young girls.103 Male perceptions of power, their ability 
to have freedom and hang with their friends, helped explain 
the gender differences in crime and delinquency.
In contrast, girls are encouraged to care about other 
people and avoid harming them; their need for sensitivity 
and understanding may help counterbalance the effects of 
poverty and family problems. And because they are more 
Some criminologists argue that although most people 
age out of crime, a small group continues into old age 
as chronic or persistent offenders. It is possible that 
the population may contain different sets of criminal 
offenders: one group whose criminality declines with 
age; another whose criminal behavior remains constant 
through maturity. This issue will be discussed in greater 
detail in Chapter 9.
CONNECTIONS
Gender and Crime
Male crime rates are much higher than those of females. 
Victims report that their assailant was male in more than 
80 percent of all violent personal crimes. The most recent 
Uniform Crime Report arrest statistics indicate that males 
account for more than 80 percent of all arrests for serious 
violent crimes and almost 70 percent of the arrests for seri-
ous property crimes; murder arrests are 8 males to 1 female. 
MTF data also show that young men commit more serious 
crimes, such as robbery, assault, and burglary, than their fe-
male peers.
Even though gender differences in the crime rate have 
persisted over time, there seems little question that females 
are now involved in more crime than ever before and that 
there are more similarities than differences between male and 
female offenders.97 UCR arrest data shows that over the past 
decade, while male arrest rates have declined by 9 percent, 
female arrest rates have increased by 9 percent. Most notable 
have been increased female arrests for serious crimes such 
as robbery (up 10 percent) and burglary (up 15 percent). 
So during a period of slowing overall growth in crime rates, 
women have increased their participation in crime.
Explaining Gender Differences in the Crime Rate Early 
criminologists pointed to emotional, physical, and psycho-
logical differences between males and females to explain the 
differences in crime rates. Cesare Lombroso’s 1895 book, The 
Female Offender, argued that a small group of female criminals 
lacked “typical” female traits of “piety, maternity, undeveloped 
intelligence, and weakness.”98 In physical appearance as well 
as in their emotional makeup, delinquent females appeared 
closer to men than to other women. Lombroso’s theory be-
came known as the masculinity hypothesis; in essence, a 
few “masculine” females were responsible for the handful of 
crimes women commit.
Another early view of female crime focused on the sup-
posed dynamics of sexual relationships. Female criminals 
were viewed as either sexually controlling or sexually naive, 
either manipulating men for profi t or being manipulated by 
them. The female’s criminality was often masked because 
criminal justice authorities were reluctant to take action

and social position. As women’s social roles changed and 
their lifestyles became more like men’s, it was believed 
that their crime rates would converge. Criminologists, re-
sponding to this research, began to refer to the “new female 
criminal.” The rapid increase in the female crime rate, espe-
cially in what had traditionally been male-oriented crimes 
(such as burglary and larceny), supports the feminist view. 
In addition, self-report studies seem to indicate that (a) the 
pattern of female criminality, if not its frequency, is quite 
similar to that of male criminality, and (b) the factors that 
predispose male criminals to crime have an equal impact on 
female criminals.108
Critical criminologists view gender inequality as stem-
ming from the unequal power of men and women in 
a capitalist society and the exploitation of females by 
fathers and husbands. This perspective is considered 
more fully in Chapter 8.
CONNECTIONS
Is Convergence Likely? Although male arrest rates are 
still considerably higher than female rates, female arrest 
rates seem to be increasing at a faster pace; it is possible 
that they may eventually converge. Women are committing 
more crime, and young girls are joining gangs in record 
numbers.109
While these trends indicate that gender differences in 
the crime rate may be eroding, some criminologists remain 
skeptical about the data. They fi nd that gender-based crime 
rate differences are still significant; the “emancipation of 
women” may have had relatively little infl uence on female 
crime rates.110 For one thing, many female criminals come 
from the socioeconomic class least affected by the women’s 
movement; their crimes seem more a function of economic 
inequality than women’s rights. For another, the offense pat-
terns of women are still quite different from those of men. 
While males still commit a disproportionate share of serious 
crimes such as robbery, burglary, murder, and assault, most 
female criminals are still engaging in less serious crimes 
than their male counterparts.111 How then can gender-based 
arrest rates be explained? According to Darrell Steffensmeier 
and his associates, these arrest trends may be explained 
more by changes in police activity than in criminal activity. 
Police today may be more willing to arrest girls for minor 
crimes; police are making more arrests for crimes that oc-
cur at school and in the home; police are responding more 
vigorously to public demands for action and are therefore 
less likely to use their discretion to help females.112 Police 
may also be abandoning their traditional deference toward 
women in an effort to be “gender neutral.” In addition, 
changing laws such as dual arrest laws in domestic cases 
that mandate both parties be taken into custody, result in 
more women suffering arrest in domestic incidents.113
verbally profi cient, many females may develop social skills 
that help them deal with confl ict without resorting to vio-
lence. Females are taught to be less aggressive and to view 
belligerence as a lack of self-control—a conclusion that is 
unlikely to be reached by a male.
Girls are usually taught—directly or indirectly—to re-
spond to provocation by feeling anxious and depressed, 
whereas boys are encouraged to retaliate. Overall, when 
they are provoked, females are much more likely to feel 
distressed than males—experiencing sadness, anxiety, and 
uneasiness. Although females may get angry as often as 
males, many have been taught to blame themselves for har-
boring such negative feelings. Females are therefore much 
more likely than males to respond to anger with feelings of 
depression, anxiety, fear, and shame. Although females are 
socialized to fear that their anger will harm valued relation-
ships, males react with “moral outrage,” looking to blame 
others for their discomfort.104
Cognitive Differences Psychologists note signifi cant cog-
nitive differences between boys and girls that may impact on 
their antisocial behaviors. Girls have been found to be supe-
rior to boys in verbal ability, while boys test higher in visual-
spatial performance. Girls acquire language faster, learning to 
speak earlier and faster with better pronunciation. Girls are 
far less likely to have reading problems than boys, while boys 
do much better on standardized math tests. (This difference 
is attributed by some experts to boys receiving more attention 
from math teachers.) In most cases these cognitive differences 
are small, narrowing, and usually attributed to cultural ex-
pectations. When given training, girls demonstrate an ability 
to increase their visual-spatial skills to the point where their 
abilities become indistinguishable from the ability of boys.
Cognitive differences may contribute to behavioral vari-
ations. Even at an early age, girls are found to be more em-
pathic than boys—that is, more capable of understanding 
and relating to the feelings of others.105 Empathy for others 
may help shield girls from antisocial acts because they are 
more likely to understand a victim’s suffering. Girls are more 
concerned with relationship and feeling issues, and they 
are less interested than boys are in competing for material 
success. Boys who are not tough and aggressive are labeled 
sissies and cry babies. In contrast, girls are given different 
messages; they are expected to form closer bonds with their 
friends and share feelings. Their superior verbal skills may 
allow girls to talk rather than fi ght. When faced with con-
fl ict, women might be more likely to attempt to negotiate, 
rather than to either respond passively or to physically re-
sist, especially when they perceive increased threat of harm 
or death.106
Feminist Views In the 1970s, liberal feminist theory fo-
cused attention on the social and economic role of women 
in society and its relationship to female crime rates.107 This 
view suggested that the traditionally lower crime rate for 
women could be explained by their “second-class” economic

as the percentage of minorities in the population increases, 
so too does the amount of social control that police direct at 
minority group members.121 Police are more likely to aggres-
sively patrol minority neighborhoods; suspect, search, and 
arrest minority group members; and make arrests for minor 
infractions, helping to raise the minority crime rate.122 For 
example, when Malcolm Holmes and his colleagues stud-
ied law enforcement actions in southwestern border com-
munities, they found that as the numbers of poor Hispanics 
increase, affluent Anglos demand greater levels of police 
protection.123 The result is a stepped-up effort to control 
and punish minority citizens, which segregates minorities 
from the economic mainstream and reinforces the physical 
and social isolation of the barrio.124
The “racial threat” effect is not the only evidence of sys-
tem bias. There are some indications that the justice system 
treats minority defendants differently from members of the 
white majority. Black, Latino, and American Indian youth 
Race and Crime
Offi cial crime data indicate that minority group members 
are involved in a disproportionate share of criminal activity. 
African Americans make up about 12 percent of the gen-
eral population, yet they account for almost 40 percent of 
Part I violent crime arrests and 30 percent of property crime 
arrests. They also are responsible for a disproportionate 
number of Part II arrests (except for alcohol-related arrests, 
which detain primarily white offenders).
Are these data a refl ection of true racial differences in 
the crime rate, or do they refl ect racial bias in the justice 
process? We can evaluate this issue by comparing racial dif-
ferences in self-report data with those found in offi cial de-
linquency records. Charges of racial discrimination in the 
justice process would be substantiated if whites and blacks 
self-reported equal numbers of crimes, but minorities were 
arrested and prosecuted far more often.
Early efforts by noted criminologists found virtually no 
relationship between race and self-reported delinquency, a 
fi nding that supported racial bias in the arrest decision pro-
cess.114 Other, more recent self-report studies that use large 
national samples of youths have also found little evidence of 
racial disparity in self-reported crimes committed.115 These 
and other self-report studies seem to indicate that the de-
linquent behavior rates of black and white teenagers are 
generally similar and that differences in arrest statistics may 
indicate a differential selection policy by police.116 Suspects 
who are poor, minority, or male are more likely to be formally 
arrested than suspects who are white, affl uent, or female.117
Evidence of racial bias in the arrest process can be found 
in the use of racial profi ling to stop African Americans and 
search their cars without probable cause or reasonable sus-
picion. Police offi cers, some social commentators note, have 
created a form of traffi c offense called DWB, “driving while 
black.”118 National surveys of driving practices show that 
young black and Latino males are more likely to be stopped 
by police and suffer citations, searches, and arrests, as well as 
be the target of force even though they are no more likely to be 
in the possession of illegal contraband than white drivers.119
Although the offi cial statistics, such as UCR arrest data, 
may refl ect discriminatory justice system practices, African 
Americans are arrested for a disproportionate amount of se-
rious violent crime, such as robbery and murder, and some 
criminologists find it improbable that police discretion 
and/or bias alone could account for these proportions. It is 
doubtful that police routinely release white killers, robbers, 
and rapists while arresting violent black offenders who com-
mit the same offenses.120 If these racial differences in serious 
crimes exist how can they be explained?
System Bias Race-based differences in the crime rate can 
be explained in part as an effect of unequal or biased treat-
ment by the justice system. There are a number of indica-
tions that system bias exists and penalizes racial minorities. 
According to what is known as the racial threat hypothesis, 
AP Images/Steve Yeater 
Empirical evidence shows that, in at least some jurisdictions, young 
African American males are treated more harshly by the criminal and 
juvenile justice systems than are members of any other group. 
Elements of institutional racism have become so endemic that terms 
such as “DWB” (driving while black) are now part of the vernacular, 
used to signify the fact that young African American motorists are 
routinely stopped by police.

56  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
Crow and Kathrine Johnson looked at the use of habitual 
sentencing practices in Florida and reached the conclusion 
that race and ethnicity still matter: minority drug and violent 
offenders are viewed as particular threats to dominant, main-
stream values and are more likely to be charged as habitual 
offenders than are European Americans.127 Nor is this solely 
a state court problem. After reviewing sentences in the federal 
court system, Jill Doerner and Stephen Demuth found that 
particularly harsh punishments are focused disproportion-
ately on the youngest Hispanic and black male defendants. 
Young Hispanic male defendants have the highest odds of 
incarceration, and young black male defendants receive the 
longest sentences.128 Yet when African Americans are victims 
of crime, their predicaments receive less public concern and 
When sociologist Alice Goffman was an 
undergraduate at the University of Penn-
sylvania, she tutored a high school student 
named Aisha. She later met Aisha’s brother 
Ronny, age 15, when he came home from a 
juvenile detention center, and Ronny intro-
duced her to Mike, who was 21, and then 
Mike’s best friend Chuck, age 18, who also 
came home from county jail. Chuck, Mike, 
and Ronny were part of a loose group of 
about 15 young men who grew up around 
6th Street in Philadelphia, most of whom 
were unemployed and trying to make it out-
side of the formal economy. Some worked 
as low-level crack dealers; others sold mari-
juana, “wet” (PCP and/or embalming fluid), 
or pills like Xanax. Some of the men occa-
sionally made money by robbing other drug 
dealers. One earned his keep by exotic 
dancing and offering sex to women.
Through her connections to these young 
people, Goffman was able to draw an un-
derstanding of life in the Philadelphia un-
derclass, the burdens faced by the urban 
poor, and the role of law enforcement in 
everyday life. On 6th Street, the constant 
threat of arrest and incarceration shaped 
behavior and values and became an inte-
gral part of everyday behavior.
In these neighborhoods, children learn 
at an early age to watch out for the police 
and to prepare to run when they see them 
in the neighborhood. The first topic of the 
day focused on who had been taken into 
custody the night before and who had out-
run the cops and gotten away. The young 
men discussed how the police identified 
and located the people they were looking 
for, what the charges were likely to be, what 
physical harm had been done to the man 
as he was caught and arrested, and what 
property the police had taken and what had 
been wrecked or lost during the chase.
In the 6th Street neighborhood, a signifi-
cant portion of the young men were “on the 
run,” some because they were suspects in 
actual street crimes, but most because there 
were outstanding arrest warrants for minor 
infractions such as shoplifting or possession 
of recreational drugs. Young men were con-
stantly worried that they would be picked up 
by the police and taken into custody even 
when they did not have a warrant out for 
their arrest. Those on probation or parole, 
on house arrest, or going through a trial ex-
pressed concern that they would soon be 
picked up and taken into custody for some 
violation that would “come up in the system.” 
People on the run make a concerted effort to 
thwart their discovery and apprehension.
Goffman found that once a man finds 
that he may be stopped by the police and 
taken into custody, he discovers that peo-
ple, places, and relations he formerly relied 
on, and that are integral to maintaining a re-
spectable identity, get redefined as paths to 
confinement. Public places and institutions 
are seen as threatening. When Alex and his 
girlfriend, Donna, both age 22, drove to the 
hospital for the birth of their son, two police 
officers came into the room and arrested 
Alex for violating parole. After Alex was ar-
rested, other young men expressed hesita-
tion to go to the hospital when their babies 
were born. Equally scary was a job in the 
legitimate economy where the police knew 
your schedule in advance and traps could 
be set, resulting in arrest and confinement.
People learn to avoid calling upon the 
justice system for help, especially if they 
have a criminal record. Goffman noted 
numerous instances in which members of 
the group contacted the police when they 
were injured, robbed, or threatened. These 
men were either in good standing with the 
courts or had no pending legal constraints. 
She did not observe any person with a war-
rant call the police or voluntarily make use 
of the courts during the six years she spent 
there. Young men with warrants seemed to 
see the authorities only as a threat to their 
safety. This has two important implications:
Because they steered clear of the law,

are treated more severely in juvenile court than their white 
counterparts. They may be more likely to be detained, have 
formal charges (petitions) fi led, and be removed from their 
homes and placed in secure confi nement.125
As adults, minority group members, especially those who 
are indigent or unemployed, continue to receive disparate 
treatment. Black and Latino adults are less likely to receive 
bail in violent crime cases than whites, and consequently 
more likely to be kept in detention pending trial.126 They 
also receive longer prison sentences than whites who com-
mit similar crimes and have similar criminal histories. Take 
for instance the use of habitual offender statutes that provide 
very long sentences for a second or third conviction (“three 
strikes and you’re out”). One recent study (2008) by Matthew

CHAPTER 2 | The Nature and Extent of Crime  57
Cultural Bias
Another explanation of racial differences in the crime rate 
rests on the legacy of racial discrimination based on person-
ality and behavior.132 The fact that U.S. culture infl uences 
African American crime rates is underscored by the fact that 
black violence rates are much lower in other nations—both 
those that are predominantly white, such as Canada, and 
those that are predominantly black, such as Nigeria.133
Some criminologists view black crime as a function of 
socialization in a society where the black family was torn 
apart and black culture destroyed in such a way that recov-
ery has proven impossible. Early experiences, beginning 
with slavery, have left a wound that has been deepened by 
media attention than that afforded white victims.129 Murders 
involving whites (and females) are much more likely to be 
punished with death than those whose victims are black 
males, a fact not lost on the minority population.130 
Disparities in justice policy result in the widely dispro-
portionate makeup of the prison population. As Figure 2.5 
shows, the percentage of minority men and women who are 
behind bars is far higher than the percentage of European 
Americans. It is not surprising that African Americans of all 
social classes hold negative attitudes toward the justice sys-
tem and view it as an arbitrary and unfair institution.131
The Race, Culture, Gender and Criminology feature dis-
cusses the associations between the threat of arrest, incar-
ceration, poverty, and culture in the minority community.
violence to protect themselves or to get 
back at others. This kind of self-help 
crime is typically carried out when the 
police and the courts are unavailable be-
cause people have warrants out for their 
arrest and may be held in custody if they 
contact the authorities.
Like going to the hospital or using the 
police and the courts, even more intimate 
relations—friends, family, and romantic 
partners—may pose a threat and thus have 
to be avoided or at least carefully navigated. 
In some instances, the police are used as 
agents of social control and as a form of di-
rect retaliation. When Michelle, age 16, got 
pregnant, she claimed that 17-year-old Reg-
gie was the father. Reggie denied he had got-
ten her pregnant until he was in jail and was 
forced to admit he was the father in order to 
buy the silence of Michelle and her aunt.
While family members, partners, or 
friends of a wanted man occasionally call 
the police on him to control his behavior or 
to punish him for a perceived wrong, close 
kin or girlfriends also link young men to the 
police because the police compel them to 
do so. It is common practice for the police 
to put pressure on friends, girlfriends, and 
family members to provide information, par-
ticularly when these people have their own 
warrants, are serving probation or parole, or 
have a pending trial. Family members and 
friends who are not themselves caught up 
in the justice system may be threatened 
with eviction or with having their children 
taken away.
In this world, maintaining a secret and 
unpredictable routine decreases the chance 
of arrest: it is easier for the police to find a 
person through his last known address if he 
comes home at around the same time to 
the same house every day. Finding a person 
at work is easier if he works a regular shift 
in the same place every day. Cultivating se-
crecy and unpredictability, then, serves as 
a general strategy to avoid confinement. 
The “secret life” also provides an excuse 
for failure: “I could not lead a respectable 
life because it would lead me to jail.” This 
explains social and economic failure in a 
culturally acceptable manner.
The presence of the criminal justice 
system in the lives of the poor, Goffman 
found, cannot simply be measured by the 
number of people sent to prison or the 
number who return home with felony con-
victions. The recent rise in imprisonment 
has fostered a climate of fear and suspicion 
in poor communities—a climate in which 
family members and friends are pressured 
to inform on one another and young men 
live as suspects and fugitives, with the daily 
fear of confinement. One strategy for cop-
ing with these risks is to avoid dangerous 
places, people, and interactions entirely. 
A young man thus does not attend the birth 
of his child or seek medical help when he 
is badly beaten. He avoids the police and 
the courts, even if it means using violence 
when he is injured or becoming the target 
of others who are looking for someone to 
rob. A second strategy is to cultivate unpre-
dictability—to remain secretive and to work 
outside the economic mainstream. To en-
sure that those close to him will not inform 
on him, a young man comes and goes in ir-
regular and unpredictable ways, remaining 
elusive and untrusting, sleeping in different 
beds, and deceiving those close to him 
about his life. Considering this burden, is it 
surprising that young men raised in this en-
vironment find themselves on the run and 
outside the law?
CRITICAL THINKING
Goffman paints a pretty bleak picture of un-
derclass life and the social forces that shape 
its existence. Should the United States in-
tervene in other countries in attempts at 
“nation building” or to develop democracy 
abroad in third-world nations when there 
are so many problems here at home?

CHAPTER 2 | The Nature and Extent of Crime  59
United States, service and retail establishments that depended 
on blue-collar spending have similarly disappeared, leaving be-
hind an economy based on welfare and government supports. 
In less than 20 years, formerly active African American neigh-
borhoods have become crime-infested inner-city ghettos.
In his most recent work, More than Just Race: Being Black 
and Poor in the Inner City, Wilson tries to explain the persis-
tence of poverty in black neighborhoods. He fi nds that both 
culture and structure play a role in crime. For example, a 
law and order political philosophy and fear of racial confl ict 
have led to high incarceration rates among African American 
males. While black women can get jobs in service industries, 
employers are less likely to hire black men, especially those 
with a criminal record. As a result, there has been a decline 
in the ability of black men to be providers, adding further 
stress to the stability of the African American family. Here 
we can see how structure and culture intertwine to produce 
stress in the African American community.136
Economic and Social Disparity Racial and ethnic dif-
ferentials in crime rates may also be tied to economic and 
social disparity. Racial and ethnic minorities are often forced 
to live in high-crime areas where the risk of victimization is 
signifi cant. People who witness violent crime and are vic-
timized may themselves engage in violence.137
Racial and ethnic minorities face a greater degree of so-
cial isolation and economic deprivation than the white ma-
jority, a condition that has been linked by empirical research 
to high violence rates.138 Not helping the situation is the fact 
that during tough economic times, blacks and whites may 
fi nd themselves competing for shrinking job opportunities. 
As economic competition between the races grows, interra-
cial homicides do likewise; economic and political rivalries 
lead to greater levels of interracial violence.139
Even during times of economic growth, lower-class Af-
rican Americans are left out of the economic mainstream, 
a fact that meets with a growing sense of frustration and 
failure.140 As a result of being shut out of educational and 
economic opportunities enjoyed by the rest of society, this 
population may be prone to the lure of illegitimate gain and 
criminality. African Americans living in lower-class inner-city 
areas may be disproportionately violent because they are ex-
posed to more violence in their daily lives than other racial 
and economic groups.141 Many black youths are forced to 
attend essentially segregated schools that are underfunded 
and deteriorated, a condition that elevates the likelihood of 
their being incarcerated in adulthood.142
The concept of relative deprivation refers to the fact 
that people compare their success to those with whom 
they are in immediate contact. Even if conditions im-
prove, they still may feel as if they are falling behind. 
A sense of relative deprivation, discussed in Chapter 6, 
may lead to criminal activity.

racism and lack of opportunity.134 Children of the slave so-
ciety were thrust into a system of forced dependency and 
ambivalence and antagonism toward one’s self and group.
In an important work, All God’s Children: The Bosket Family 
and the American Tradition of Violence, crime reporter Fox But-
terfi eld chronicles the history of the Boskets, a black family, 
through fi ve generations.135 He focuses on Willie Bosket, who 
is charming, captivating, and brilliant. He is also one of the 
worst criminals in the New York State penal system. By the 
time he was in his teens, he had committed more than 200 
armed robberies and 25 stabbings. Butterfi eld shows how the 
early struggles in the South, with its violent slave culture, led 
directly to Willie Bosket’s rage and violence on the streets of 
New York City. Beginning in South Carolina in the 1700s, 
the southern slave society was a place where white notions of 
honor demanded immediate retaliation for the smallest slight. 
According to Butterfi eld, contemporary black violence is a 
tradition inherited from white southern violence. The need 
for respect has turned into a cultural mandate that can pro-
voke retaliation at the slightest hint of insult.
Structural Bias
A third view is that racial differences in the crime rate are a 
function of disparity in the social and economic structure of 
society. William Julius Wilson, one of the nation’s most prom-
inent sociologists, provides a description of the plight of the 
lowest levels of the underclass, which he labels the truly dis-
advantaged, most often minority group members who dwell 
in urban inner cities, occupy the bottom rung of the social 
ladder, and are the victims of discrimination. Because the 
truly disadvantaged rarely come into contact with the actual 
source of their oppression, they direct their anger and aggres-
sion at those with whom they are in close contact, such as 
neighbors, businesspeople, and landlords. Plagued by under- 
or unemployment, they begin to lose self-confi dence, a feeling 
exacerbated by the plight of kin and friendship groups who 
also experience extreme economic marginality. Self-doubt 
is a neighborhood norm that threatens to overwhelm those 
forced to live in areas of concentrated poverty. Most adults 
in inner-city ghetto neighborhoods are not working during 
a typical week and are therefore not affected by short-term 
economic trends. Poverty in these inner-city areas is pervasive 
and unchanging—if anything, it is steadily worsening as resi-
dents are further shut out of the economic mainstream.
Wilson focuses on the plight of the African American com-
munity, which had enjoyed periods of relative prosperity in the 
1950s and 1960s. He suggests that as diffi cult as life was for 
African Americans in the 1940s and 1950s, they at least had 
a reasonable hope of steady work. Now, because of the global-
ization of the economy, those opportunities have evaporated. 
In the past, growth in the manufacturing sector fueled upward 
mobility and formed the foundation of today’s African Ameri-
can middle class. Those opportunities no longer exist, because 
manufacturing plants have been moved to inaccessible ru-
ral and overseas locations where the cost of doing business is 
lower. With manufacturing opportunities all but obsolete in the

60  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
Immigration and Crime
There is a prevailing view that illegal immigrants are dan-
gerous and violent people and that areas that house il-
legal immigrants experience a spike in their crime rates. 
This view culminated in the passage in Arizona of a new 
law—the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neigh-
borhoods Act—that creates new crimes and enables police 
officers to stop, detain, and arrest people for what they 
perceive as immigration violation—reasonable suspicion 
that they are in the country without documentation.148
This law makes it a crime to lack immigration papers and 
requires police to determine whether people they encoun-
ter are in the country illegally.149 Some elements of this 
law have been challenged in the courts. On November 1, 
2010, a three-judge panel from the Ninth Circuit began 
deliberations on the law, indicating it might uphold it in 
principle.150
Some critics call for tough new laws limiting immigra-
tion and/or strictly enforcing immigration laws because im-
migrants are crime prone and represent a social threat. How 
true are their perceptions? Not very true, according to the 
report “Crime, Corrections, and California: What Does Im-
migration Have to Do with It?” released by the Public Policy 
Institute of California.151 According to the data, immigrants 
are far less likely than the average U.S. native to commit 
crime. Signifi cantly lower rates of incarceration and institu-
tionalization among foreign-born adults suggest that long-
standing fears of immigration as a threat to public safety are 
unjustifi ed. Among the key fi ndings:
People born outside the United States make up about 
 
■
35 percent of California’s adult population but represent 
about 17 percent of the state prison population.
U.S.-born adult men are incarcerated in state prisons at 
 
■
rates up to 3.3 times higher than foreign-born men.
Among men ages 18 to 40—the age group most likely 
 
■
to commit crime—those born in the United States are 
10 times more likely than immigrants to be in county 
jail or state prison.
Noncitizen men from Mexico ages 18 to 40—a group 
 
■
disproportionately likely to have entered the United 
States illegally—are more than 8 times less likely than 
U.S.-born men in the same age group to be in a correc-
tional setting (0.48 percent versus 4.2 percent).
The fi ndings are striking because immigrants in California 
are more likely than the U.S.-born to be young and male 
and to have low levels of education—all characteristics as-
sociated with higher rates of crime and incarceration. Yet 
the report shows that institutionalization rates of young 
male immigrants with less than a high school diploma are 
extremely low, particularly when compared with U.S.-born 
men with low levels of education.
The California report is not unique. A number of re-
search studies have concluded that immigrants have 
lower crime rates than the norm. For example, a recent 
Family Dissolution Family dissolution in the minority 
community may be tied to low employment rates among Af-
rican American males, which places a strain on marriages. 
The relatively large number of single-female-headed house-
holds in these communities may be tied to the high mortality 
rate among African American males, caused by disease and 
violence.143 When families are weakened or disrupted, their 
social control is compromised. It is not surprising, then, that 
divorce and separation rates are signifi cantly associated with 
homicide rates in the African American community.144
According to some criminologists, racism has created 
isolated subcultures that espouse violence as a way of 
coping with confl ict situations. Exasperation and frus-
tration among minority group members who feel pow-
erless to fi t into middle-class society are manifested in 
aggression. This view is discussed further in Chapter 10, 
which reviews the subculture of violence theory.
CONNECTIONS
Is Convergence Possible? Race differences in family
structure, economic status, education achievement, and 
other social factors persist. Does that mean that racial dif-
ferences in the crime rate will persist, or is convergence 
possible? One argument is that if and when economic 
conditions improve in the minority community, differ-
ences in crime rates will eventually disappear.145 Another 
view is that the trend toward residential integration, under 
way since 1980, may also help reduce crime rate differen-
tials.146 An important study (2010) by Gary LaFree and his 
associates tracked race-specifi c homicide arrest differences 
in 80 large U.S. cities from 1960 to 2000, and found sub-
stantial convergence in black/white homicide arrest rates 
over time.147
Homicide rate differences narrowed in cities with a 
growing black population and also where there was lit-
tle race-based difference in the number of intact families. 
In other words, where the percentage of families led by a 
single parent were equal in the black and white communi-
ties, crime rates went down. Conversely, homicide ratios ex-
panded in cities where African Americans were involved in 
more drug-related crimes than whites. This fi nding indicates 
that crime rate convergence may be linked to social factors. 
Positive factors, such as equality in family structure, will re-
duce race-based differences; negative factors, such as drug 
use differentials, will enhance race-based differences. In 
sum, the weight of the evidence shows that although there 
is little difference in the self-reported crime rates of racial 
groups, Hispanics and African Americans are more likely to 
be arrested for serious violent crimes. The causes of minor-
ity crime have been linked to poverty, racism, hopelessness, 
lack of opportunity, and urban problems experienced by all 
too many African American citizens.

CHAPTER 2 | The Nature and Extent of Crime  61
a group of 627 boys arrested fi ve times or more, who ac-
counted for 18 percent of the delinquents and 6 percent of 
the total sample of 9,945. (See Figure 2.6.)
The chronic offenders (known today as “the chronic 6 
percent”) were involved in the most dramatic amounts of 
delinquent behavior: they were responsible for 5,305 of-
fenses, or 51.9 percent of all the offenses committed by the 
cohort. Even more striking was the involvement of chronic 
offenders in serious criminal acts. Of the entire sample, the 
chronic 6 percent committed 71 percent of the homicides, 
73 percent of the rapes, 82 percent of the robberies, and 69 
percent of the aggravated assaults.
Wolfgang and his associates found that arrests and court 
experience did little to deter the chronic offender. In fact, 
punishment was inversely related to chronic offending: the 
more stringent the sanction chronic offenders received, the 
more likely they would be to engage in repeated criminal 
behavior.
In a second cohort study, Wolfgang and his associates 
selected a new, larger birth cohort, born in Philadelphia in 
1958, which contained both male and female subjects.155 
Although the proportion of delinquent youths was about the 
same as that in the 1945 cohort, they again found a similar 
pattern of chronic offending. Chronic female delinquency 
was relatively rare—only 1 percent of the females in the sur-
vey were chronic offenders. Wolfgang’s pioneering effort to 
examination by Ramiro Martinez of ho-
micide rates in Texas found that counties 
on the Mexican border have signifi cantly 
lower homicide rates than non-border 
counties, and Texas counties with higher 
levels of immigration concentration had 
lower levels of homicide. Not only are 
Latino homicide rates lower in these ar-
eas, so are those of non-Latino whites 
and blacks. No compelling support was 
found for the claim that border areas 
are more violent due to proximity or 
immigration.152
The low rates of criminal involve-
ment by immigrants may be due in 
part to current U.S. immigration policy, 
which screens immigrants for criminal 
history and assigns extra penalties to 
noncitizens who commit crimes.
Chronic Offenders/
Criminal Careers
Crime data show that most offenders 
commit a single criminal act and upon 
arrest discontinue their antisocial activ-
ity. Others commit a few less serious 
crimes. A small group of criminal of-
fenders, however, account for a major-
ity of all criminal offenses. These persistent offenders are 
referred to as career criminals or chronic offenders. The 
concept of the chronic or career offender is most closely 
associated with the research efforts of Marvin Wolfgang, 
Robert Figlio, and Thorsten Sellin.153 In their landmark 
1972 study, Delinquency in a Birth Cohort, they used offi cial 
records to follow the criminal careers of a cohort of 9,945 
boys born in Philadelphia in 1945 from the time of their 
birth until they reached 18 years of age in 1963. Offi cial 
police records were used to identify delinquents. About 
one-third of the boys (3,475) had some police contact. The 
remaining two-thirds (6,470) had none. Each delinquent 
was given a seriousness weight score for every delinquent 
act.154 The weighting of delinquent acts allowed the re-
searchers to differentiate between a simple assault requiring 
no medical attention for the victim and serious battery in 
which the victim needed hospitalization. The best-known 
discovery of Wolfgang and his associates was that of the 
so-called chronic offender. The cohort data indicated that 
54 percent (1,862) of the sample’s delinquent youths were 
repeat offenders, whereas the remaining 46 percent (1,613) 
were one-time offenders. The repeaters could be further 
categorized as nonchronic recidivists and chronic recidi-
vists. The former consisted of 1,235 youths who had been 
arrested more than once but fewer than fi ve times and who 
made up 35.6 percent of all delinquents. The latter were

62  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
Persistence: The Continuity of Crime One of the most 
important fi ndings from the cohort studies is that persistent 
juvenile offenders are the ones most likely to continue their 
criminal careers into adulthood.162 Paul Tracy and Kimberly 
Kempf-Leonard followed up all subjects in the second 1958 
cohort and found that two-thirds of delinquent offenders 
desisted from crime, but those who started their delinquent 
careers early and who committed serious violent crimes 
throughout adolescence were the most likely to persist as 
adults.163 This phenomenon is referred to as persistence or 
the continuity of crime.164
Children who are found to be disruptive and antiso-
cial as early as age 5 or 6 are the most likely to exhibit 
stable, long-term patterns of disruptive behavior through-
out adolescence.165 They have measurable behavior prob-
lems in areas such as learning and motor skills, cognitive 
abilities, family relations, and other areas of social, psy-
chological, and physical functioning.166 Youthful offend-
ers who persist are more likely to abuse alcohol, get into 
trouble while in military service, become economically 
dependent, have lower aspirations, get divorced or sepa-
rated, and have a weak employment record.167 They do 
not specialize in one type of crime; rather, they engage in 
a variety of criminal acts, including theft, use of drugs, 
and violent offenses.
Implications of the Chronic Offender Concept The fi nd-
ings of the cohort studies and the discovery of the chronic 
offender have revitalized criminological theory. If relatively 
few offenders become chronic, persistent criminals, then 
perhaps they possess some individual trait that is responsi-
ble for their behavior. Most people exposed to troublesome 
social conditions, such as poverty, do not become chronic 
offenders, so it is unlikely that social conditions alone can 
cause chronic offending. Traditional theories of criminal be-
havior have failed to distinguish between chronic and occa-
sional offenders. They concentrate more on explaining why 
people begin to commit crime and pay scant attention to 
why people stop offending. The discovery of the chronic of-
fender 30 years ago forced criminologists to consider such 
issues as persistence and desistance in their explanations of 
crime; more recent theories account for not only the onset 
of criminality but also its termination.
identify the chronic career offender has been replicated by a 
number of other researchers in a variety of locations in the 
United States.156 The chronic offender has also been found 
abroad.157
What Causes Chronicity? As might be expected, kids who 
have been exposed to a variety of personal and social prob-
lems at an early age are the most at risk to repeat offending, 
a concept referred to as early onset. One important study 
of delinquent offenders in Orange County, California, con-
ducted by Michael Schumacher and Gwen Kurz, found sev-
eral factors (see Exhibit 2.3) that characterized the chronic 
offender, including problems in the home and at school.158
Other research studies have found that early involvement in 
criminal activity (getting arrested before age 15), relatively 
low intellectual development, and parental drug involvement 
were key predictive factors for chronicity.159 Offenders who 
accumulate large debts, use drugs, and resort to violence are 
more likely to persist.160 In contrast, those who spend time in 
a juvenile facility and later in an adult prison are more likely 
to desist.161
EXHIBIT 2.3
Characteristics that Predict 
Chronic Offending
School Behavior/Performance Factor
 • Attendance problems (truancy or a pattern of skipping 
school)
 • Behavior problems (recent suspensions or expulsion)
 • Poor grades (failing two or more classes)
Family Problem Factor
 • Poor parental supervision and control
 • Significant family problems (illness, substance abuse, 
discord)
 • Criminal family members
 • Documented child abuse, neglect, or family violence
Substance Abuse Factor
 • Alcohol or drug use (by minors in any way but 
experimentation)
Delinquency Factor
 • Stealing pattern of behavior
 • Runaway pattern of behavior
 • Gang member or associate

Preventing Serious Repeat Juvenile Crime (Thousand Oaks, CA: 
Sage, 1999).
It is evident that chronic offenders suffer from a pro-
fusion of social problems. Some criminologists believe 
that accumulating a signifi cant variety of these social 
defi cits is the key to understanding criminal develop-
ment. For more on this topic, see the discussion on 
problem behavior syndrome in Chapter 9.

The planning director for the State Department 
of Juvenile Justice has asked for your advice on 
how to reduce the threat of chronic offenders. 
Some of the more conservative members of 
her staff seem to believe that these kids need 
a strict dose of rough justice if they are to be 
turned away from a life of crime. They believe 
juvenile delinquents who are punished harshly 
are less likely to recidivate than youths who 
receive lesser punishments, such as commu-
nity corrections or probation. In addition, they 
believe that hardcore, violent offenders deserve to be pun-
ished; excessive concern for offenders and not their acts ignores the 
rights of victims and society in general.
The planning director is unsure whether such an approach is 
ethical. Is it ethical to use tough punishment with kids because 
it may produce deviant identities that lock 
kids into a criminal way of life? She is con-
cerned that a strategy stressing punishment 
is not only unethical, but it will have relatively 
little impact on chronic offenders and, if any-
thing, may cause escalation in serious criminal 
behaviors.
❯❯ The director has asked you for your profes-
sional advice on this ethical dilemma. Write a 
two-page memorandum: On the one hand, the 
system must be sensitive to the adverse effects 
of stigma and labeling. On the other hand, the need for control 
and deterrence must not be ignored. Is it possible to reconcile 
these two opposing views?
Does Tough Love Work?
THINKING LIKE A CRIMINOLOGIST ❯ An Ethical Dilemma
The chronic offender has become a central focus of 
crime control policy. Apprehension and punishment seem 
to have little effect on the offending behavior of chronic of-
fenders, and most repeat their criminal acts after their cor-
rectional release.168 Because chronic offenders rarely learn 
from their mistakes, sentencing policies designed to inca-
pacitate chronic offenders for long periods of time without 
hope of probation or parole have been established. Inca-
pacitation rather than rehabilitation is the goal. Among the 
policies spurred by the chronic offender concept are man-
datory sentences for violent or drug-related crimes, “three 
strikes” policies, which require people convicted of a third 
felony offense to serve a mandatory life sentence, and “truth 
in sentencing” policies, which require that convicted felons 
spend a signifi cant portion of their sentence behind bars. 
Whether such policies can reduce crime rates or are merely 
“get tough” measures designed to placate conservative vot-
ers remains to be seen.
SUMMARY
 1. Be familiar with the various 
forms of crime data
The Federal Bureau of Investiga-
 
■
tion collects data from local law 
enforcement agencies and pub-
lishes that information yearly in 
its Uniform Crime Report (UCR). 
The National Incident-Based Re-
porting System (NIBRS) is a pro-
gram that collects data on each 
reported crime incident. The 
National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCVS) is a nationwide 
survey of victimization in the 
United States. Self-report surveys 
ask people to describe, in detail, 
their recent and lifetime partici-
pation in criminal activity.
 3. Be able to discuss recent trends 
in the crime rate
Crime rates peaked in 1991 
 
■
when police recorded almost 
15 million crimes. Since then, the 
number of crimes has been in de-
cline. About 10.5 million crimes 
were reported in 2009, a drop of 
4 million reported crimes since 
the 1991 peak, despite an in-
crease of about 50 million in the 
general population. NCVS data 
show that criminal victimizations 
have declined signifi cantly dur-
ing the past 30 years: in 1973, an 
estimated 44 million victimiza-
tions were recorded, compared to 
20 million today.
 2. Know the problems associated 
with collecting data
Many serious crimes are not 
 
■
reported to police and there-
fore are not counted by the 
UCR. The NCVS may have 
problems due to victims’ mis-
interpretation of events and 
under-reporting prompted by 
the embarrassment of report-
ing crime to interviewers, fear 
of getting in trouble, or simply 
forgetting an incident. And re-
spondents in self-report studies 
may exaggerate their criminal 
acts, forget some of them, or be 
confused about what is being 
asked.

 4. Be familiar with the factors that 
infl uence crime rates
The age composition of the 
 
■
population, the number of im-
migrants, the availability of 
legalized abortion, the number 
of guns, drug use, availability 
of emergency medical services, 
numbers of police offi cers, the 
state of the economy, cultural 
change, and criminal opportu-
nities all infl uence crime rates.
 5. Compare crime rates under dif-
ferent ecological conditions
Patterns in the crime rate seem 
 
■
to be linked to temporal and 
ecological factors. Most re-
ported crimes occur during July 
and August. Large urban areas 
have by far the highest rates of 
violent crimes, and rural areas 
have the lowest per capita.
 6. Be able to discuss the associa-
tion between social class and 
crime
People living in poverty engage 
 
■
in disproportionate amounts 
of expressive crimes, such as 
share of criminal activity. Racial 
and ethnic differentials in crime 
rates may be tied to economic 
and social disparity.
 9. Be familiar with Wolfgang, 
Figlio, and Sellin’s pioneering 
research on chronic offending
The concept of the chronic or ca-
 
■
reer offender is most closely asso-
ciated with the research efforts of 
Marvin Wolfgang, Robert Figlio, 
and Thorsten Sellin. Chronic of-
fenders are involved in signifi cant 
amounts of delinquent behavior 
and tend later to become adult 
criminals. Unlike most offenders, 
they do not age out of crime.
 10. Understand the suspected 
causes of chronicity
Kids who have been exposed to 
 
■
a variety of personal and social 
problems at an early age are the 
most at risk to repeat offending. 
Chronic offenders often have 
problems in the home and at 
school, relatively low intellec-
tual development, and parental 
drug involvement.
rape and assault. Crime rates in 
inner-city, high-poverty areas 
are generally higher than those 
in suburban or wealthier areas.
 7. Know what is meant by the 
term aging-out process
Regardless of economic status, 
 
■
marital status, race, sex, and other 
factors, younger people com-
mit crime more often than older 
people, and this relationship has 
been stable across time. Most 
criminologists agree that people 
commit less crime as they age.
 8. Recognize that there are gender 
and racial patterns in crime
Male crime rates are much higher 
 
■
than those of females. Gender 
differences in the crime rate have 
persisted over time, but there is 
little question that females are 
now involved in more crime than 
ever before and that there are 
more similarities than differences 
between male and female offend-
ers. Offi cial crime data indicate 
that minority group members are 
involved in a disproportionate

ON
On February 25, 2006, Imette St. Guillen stopped in for a late night drink at The Falls bar, a popular New 
York City nightspot. Later that evening, the bar’s manager asked the bouncer, Darryl Littlejohn, to escort 
St. Guillen out after she stayed past the 4 A.M. closing time.1 Later he recalled hearing the pair argue before 
they disappeared through a side door. Sometime during the next 17 hours, St. Guillen was raped and killed 
and her bound body left on the side of a desolate Brooklyn roadway. Police investigators soon set their sights 
on Littlejohn, a felon with prior convictions for robbery, drugs, and gun possession. He was indicted for 
murder when blood found on plastic ties that were used to bind St. Guillen’s hands behind her back matched 
Littlejohn’s DNA.

72  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
T
PROBLEMS OF CRIME 
VICTIMS
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) indicates 
that the annual number of victimizations in the United 
States is about 20 million.3 Being the target or victim of a 
rape, robbery, or assault is a terrible burden that can have 
considerable long-term consequences.4 The costs of victim-
ization can include such things as damaged property, pain 
and suffering to victims, and the involvement of the police 
and other agencies of the justice system. In this section, we 
explore some of the effects of these incidents.
Economic Loss
When the costs of goods taken during property crimes is 
added to productivity losses caused by injury, pain, and 
emotional trauma, the cost of victimization is estimated to 
be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
System Costs The American taxpayer is burdened with 
the costs of crime and justice. While it is diffi cult to pin-
point the exact costs of crime, criminologists using methods 
similar to those employed to determine civil damages fi nd 
The St. Guillen murder case illustrates the importance of 
understanding the victim’s role in the crime process. Why 
do people become targets of predatory criminals? Do people 
become victims because of their lifestyle and environment? 
Did Imette contribute to her attack by staying out late at 
night, drinking, and being alone? Imette’s friends, who had 
been with her earlier in the evening, had left her in the early 
morning hours because they considered The Falls bar neigh-
borhood safe. If Imette had been with friends to guard her, 
would she be alive today? And is this a matter of unfairly 
“blaming the victim” for her risky behavior? Can someone 
actually defl ect or avoid criminal behavior or is it a matter 
of fate and chance? What can be done to protect victims, for 
instance, if a convicted violent criminal is employed in a bar 
and asked to escort patrons? And, failing that, what can be 
done to help them in the aftermath of crime?
Criminologists who focus their attention on crime vic-
tims refer to themselves as victimologists. This chapter 
examines victims and their relationship to the criminal 
process. First, using available victim data, we analyze the 
nature and extent of victimization. We then discuss the re-
lationship between victims and criminal offenders. During 
this discussion, we look at the various theories of victimiza-
tion that attempt to explain the victim’s role in the crime 
problem. Finally, we examine how society has responded to 
the needs of victims and discuss the special problems they 
still face.
Imette St. Guillen was a brilliant and beautiful young woman loved by her family and friends. She 
attended the Boston Latin School in Massachusetts and graduated magna cum laude from George Washington 
University in 2003 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. At the time of her death, she was a graduate student at 
John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, where she would have completed her master’s degree 
in May 2006. “New York was Imette’s home,” her sister, Alejandra St. Guillen, told reporters. “She loved the 
city and its people . . . Imette was a good person, a kind person. Her heart was full of love. With Imette’s 
death, the world lost someone very special too soon.”2
On July 8, 2009, Littlejohn faced Kings County Supreme Court Justice Abraham Gerges at his 
sentencing hearing. He heard members of Imette’s family tearfully address the court. “I will never share 
another birthday with her,” her mother, Maureen St. Hilaire, told the judge. Her sister Alejandra accused 
Littlejohn of robbing her of “my one sister and my dearest friend.” “I’ll never see my sister marry,” she 
said. “I’ll never hold Imette’s children in my arms. Imette’s loss is with me forever.” “The last thing she 
did before she left, she turned around and waved,” Maureen St. Guillen said. “[She] mouthed, ‘I love you, 
mom.’” After hearing all testimony, Judge Gerges called Littlejohn an unrepentant “predator” who should 
never taste freedom again. “If there were truly justice in this world, I would have the power to bring her 
back to you,” Gerges told Maureen and Alejandra, who sobbed in the courtroom. “To my great sorrow, that 
is not possible.”

CHAPTER 3 | Victims and Victimization  73
victim does not receive adequate support from family and 
friends.11 To shield themselves, some victims deny the at-
tack occurred or question whether they were “really raped.” 
But denial only goes so far and does not shield victims from 
the long-term effects of sexual assault.12
Men may be particularly susceptible to post-rape PTSD, 
believing that their situation is both unique and somehow “un-
manly.” Knowing the effect of a sexual assault on men, rape has 
become an interrogation tool in some theaters of war. Sexual 
assault was routinely used during the civil war in Yugoslavia 
to terrorize male prisoners. The Croats, Serbs, and Bosnians 
who were attacked suffered from a variety of traumatic reac-
tions, including sleep disturbances, concentration diffi culties, 
nightmares and fl ashbacks, feelings of hopelessness, constant 
headaches, profuse sweating, and rapid heartbeat.13
Adolescent Stress 
It is widely assumed that younger 
children are less likely to be injured in attacks than older 
teens and adults, but in fact the opposite may be true.14 
Recent research by David Finkelhor and his colleagues at 
the University of New Hampshire Crimes Against Children 
Research Center found that younger children’s victimiza-
tion by peers and siblings was similar to that experienced by 
older youth. Both groups suffered similar injuries, were just 
as likely to be hit with an object that could cause injury, and 
were victimized on multiple occasions.15
These younger victims are also more prone to suffer 
stress. Adolescent victims are particularly at risk to PTSD.16 
Kids who have undergone traumatic sexual experiences later 
suffer psychological defi cits.17 Mark Shelvin and his associ-
ates found that a history of childhood trauma, including rape 
and molestation, was signifi cantly associated with visual, au-
ditory, and tactile hallucinations. Kids who were repeatedly 
traumatized increased their experience with the three types 
of hallucinations, clearly indicating that childhood abuse can 
have a devastating effect on long-term mental health.18
Many run away to escape their environment, which puts 
them at risk for juvenile arrest and involvement with the 
justice system.19 Others suffer posttraumatic mental prob-
lems, including acute stress disorders, depression, eating 
disorders, nightmares, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and other 
psychological problems.20 Stress, however, does not end in 
childhood. Children who are psychologically, sexually, or 
physically abused are more likely to suffer low self-esteem 
and be more suicidal as adults.21 They are also placed at 
greater risk to be re-abused as adults than those who es-
caped childhood victimization.22 The re-abused carry higher 
risks for psychological and physical problems, ranging 
from sexual promiscuity to increased HIV infection rates.23 
Abuse as a child may lead to despair, depression, and even 
homelessness as an adult. One study of homeless women 
found that they were much more likely than other women 
to report childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse, 
adult physical assault, previous sexual assault in adulthood, 
and a history of mental health problems.24
that over the lifetime of their careers in crime the typical 
criminal costs society about $2 million.5 Using this form of 
analysis, violent crime by juveniles alone costs the United 
States more than $160 billion each year.6 This estimate in-
cludes some of the costs incurred by federal, state, and local 
governments to assist victims of juvenile violence, such as 
medical treatment for injuries and services for victims, which 
amounts to about $30 billion. The remaining $130 billion is 
due to losses suffered by victims, such as lost wages, pain, 
suffering, and reduced quality of life. Not included in these 
fi gures are the costs incurred trying to reduce juvenile vio-
lence, which include early prevention programs, services for 
juveniles, and the juvenile justice system.
Juvenile violence is only one part of the crime picture. 
If the cost of the justice system, legal costs, treatment costs, 
and so on are included, the total loss due to crime amounts 
to $450 billion annually, or about $1,800 per U.S. citizen. 
Crime produces social costs that must be paid by nonvic-
tims as well. For example, heroin abuse may cost the nation 
up to $20 billion per year, including the medical complica-
tions of heroin addiction, primarily treatment for HIV/AIDS 
and psychiatric care, as well as paying for the cost of incar-
ceration, policing, legal adjudication, and the cost to crime 
victims. There is also the cost of lost productivity—heroin 
addicts are less than half as likely to have a full-time job as 
compared with the national average—and the treatment of 
heroin addiction in clinics and hospitals.7
Individual Costs In addition to these societal costs, vic-
tims may suffer long-term losses in earnings and occupa-
tional attainment. Victim costs resulting from an assault 
are as high as $14,000, and costs are even higher for rape 
and arson; the average murder costs more than $4 million.8 
 Research by Ross Macmillan shows that Americans who 
 suffer a violent victimization during adolescence earn about 
$110,000 less than nonvictims during their lifetime; Cana-
dian victims earn $300,000 less. Macmillan reasons that 
victims bear psychological and physical ills that inhibit fi rst 
their academic achievement and later their economic and 
professional success.9
Some victims are physically disabled as a result of seri-
ous wounds sustained during episodes of random violence, 
including a growing number who suffer paralyzing spinal 
cord injuries. If victims have no insurance, the long-term 
effects of the crime may have devastating fi nancial as well as 
emotional and physical consequences.10
Suffering Stress and PTSD
Victims may suffer stress and anxiety long after the incident 
is over and the justice process has been completed. Post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—a condition whose 
symptoms include depression, anxiety, and self-destruc-
tive behavior—is a common problem especially when the

74  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
Fear
Many people fear crime, especially the elderly, the poor, and 
minority group members.27 Their fear is escalated by lurid 
news accounts of crime and violence.28
While hearing about crime causes fear, those who ex-
perience it are even more likely to be fearful and change 
their behaviors. Victims of violent crime are the most 
deeply affected, fearing a repeat of their attack. Many go 
through a fundamental life change, viewing the world 
more suspiciously and as a less safe, controllable, and 
meaningful place. Some develop a generalized fear of 
crime and worry about being revictimized. For example, 
if they have been assaulted, they may develop fears that 
their house will be burglarized.29 These people are more 
likely to suffer psychological stress for extended periods 
of time.30
Crime can have devastating effects on its victims, who 
may take years to recover from the incident. In a moving 
book, Aftermath: Violence and the Remaking of a Self, rape 
victim Susan Brison recounts the diffi cult time she had re-
covering from her ordeal. The trauma disrupted her mem-
ory, cutting off events that happened before the rape from 
those that occurred afterward, and eliminated her ability to 
conceive of a happy or productive future. Although sym-
pathizers encouraged her to forget the past, she found that 
confronting it could be therapeutic.31
The National Organization for Victim Assistance 
is a private, nonprofit organization of victim 
and witness assistance programs and practitioners, 
criminal justice agencies and professionals, mental 
health professionals, researchers, former victims and 
survivors, and others committed to the recognition and 
implementation of victim rights and services. For more 
information about victim assistance, visit the Criminal 
Justice CourseMate at cengagebrain.com, then access 
the “Web Links” for this chapter.
Vicarious Fear Even if people are not personally victim-
ized, those who observe or are exposed to violence on a 
routine basis become fearful.32 Hearing about another’s vic-
timization may make people timid and cautious.33 If they 
don’t fear for themselves, they become concerned for oth-
ers—their wives or husbands, children, elderly parents, and 
siblings.34 Not only are people likely to move out of their 
neighborhood if they become crime victims, but they are 
also likely to relocate if they hear that a friend or neighbor 
has suffered a break-in or burglary.35
Vicarious fear is escalated by lurid news accounts of 
crime and violence.36 Matthew Lee and Erica DeHart 
found that news stories about serial killers on a rampage 
can cause a chill felt throughout the city. About half the 
people they surveyed who had read or heard about serial 
killers experienced an increase in their fear of crime that 
Relationship Stress Spousal abuse takes a particularly 
heavy toll on victims. Numerous research efforts show that 
victims of spousal abuse suffer an extremely high prevalence 
of psychological problems, including but not limited to 
depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic dis-
order, substance use disorders, borderline personality dis-
order, antisocial personality disorder, posttraumatic stress 
disorder (an emotional disturbance following exposure to 
stresses outside the range of normal human experience), 
anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(an extreme preoccupation with certain thoughts and com-
pulsive performance of certain behaviors).25 One reason 
may be that abusive spouses are as likely to abuse their vic-
tims psychologically with threats and intimidation as they 
are to use physical force; psychological abuse can lead to 
depression and other long-term disabilities.26
After being the target of violent crime, victims often display long-term 
fear and anxiety, including posttraumatic stress disorder. Here, former 
Halliburton/KBR employees Tracy Barker (left) and Jamie Leigh Jones 
participate in a news conference on Capitol Hill, December 19, 2007, 
in Washington, D.C. Barker said she was sexually assaulted in 2005 by 
a State Department employee while working for KBR, Inc., a large U.S. 
contractor, at a company-run camp in Basra, Iraq. Jones says that she 
was raped by co-workers and held against her will while working for 
KBR at Camp Hope in Baghdad. Many victims of sexual assault suffer 
psychological pain long after their physical injuries have healed.

self-protection.45 In some cultures, retaliation is an 
 expected and accepted response to victimization.46
Spurious association.
 
■
 It is also possible that the associa-
tion between victimization and crime is spurious and 
that victims and criminals are actually two separate 
groups. The personal traits that produce violent crimi-
nals, such as impulsive personality, may not be the same 
ones that produce victims.47 There may appear to be a 
connection because both criminals and victims tend to 
have the same lifestyle and live in the same neighbor-
hoods, making it seem they are one and the same.
THE NATURE OF 
VICTIMIZATION
How many crime victims are there in the United States, and 
what are the trends and patterns in victimization? As noted 
in Chapter 2, about 21 million criminal victimizations now 
occur each year.48 While this total is signifi cant, it represents 
almost a 20-year decline in criminal victimization from 
a peak of more than 40 million reported victimizations. 
Figures 3.1 and 3.2 demonstrate changes in violent and 
property victimizations between 1998 and 2009, a period 
when violence rates dropped 41 percent and property vic-
timizations dropped 32 percent.
prompted them to protect themselves and their family by 
implementing some sort of protective measure, such as 
carrying mace or pepper spray or adding a security device 
to their home.37
Antisocial Behavior
Does victimization produce antisocial behaviors? Is it pos-
sible that people who are victimized strike back at others, 
becoming antisocial themselves? Is it possible then that 
criminals and victims are not two separate and distinct 
groups but rather one and the same?38 The abuse–crime 
phenomenon is referred to as the cycle of violence.39 
Research shows that both boys and girls are more likely 
to engage in violent behavior if they were the targets of 
physical abuse and were exposed to violent behavior 
among adults they know or live with or were exposed to 
weapons.40
The mission of the National Center for Victims of 
Crime is to help victims of crime rebuild their lives: 
“We are dedicated to serving individuals, families, and 
communities harmed by crime.” Learn more by visiting the 
Criminal Justice CourseMate at cengagebrain.com, then 
access the “Web Links” for this chapter.
People who were physically or sexually abused, espe-
cially young males, are much more likely to smoke, drink, 
and take drugs than are non-abused youth. As adults, vic-
tims are more likely to commit crimes themselves.41
Given the evidence pointing to a link between victimiza-
tion and crime, how can the association be explained?
Victimization causes social problems.
 
■
 People who are 
crime victims experience long-term negative conse-
quences, including problems with unemployment and 
developing personal relationships, factors related to 
criminality. Some young victims may run away from 
home, taking to the streets and increasing their risk of 
becoming a crime victim.42
Victimization causes stress and anger.
 
■
 Victimization 
may produce anger, stress, and strain. Known offend-
ers report signifi cant amounts of posttraumatic stress 
disorder as a result of prior victimization, which 
may in part explain their violent and criminal 
behaviors.43
Victimization prompts revenge.
 
■
 Victims may seek revenge 
against the people who harmed them or whom they 
believe are at fault for their problems. In some cases, 
these feelings become generalized to others who share 
the same characteristics of their attackers (e.g., men, 
Hispanics).44 As a result, their reactions become dis-
placed, and they may lash out at people who are not 
their attackers. They may take drastic measures, 
fearing revictimization, and arm themselves for

half that of city dwellers. The risk of murder for both men 
and women is signifi cantly higher in disorganized inner-
city areas where gangs flourish and drug trafficking is 
commonplace.
Crime in Schools Schools unfortunately are the locale 
of a great deal of victimization because they are populated 
by one of the most dangerous segments of society, teenage 
males. During before- and after-school activities, adult su-
pervision is minimal, and hallways and locker rooms are 
typically left unattended. Kids who participate in school 
sports may leave their valuables in locker rooms that make 
attractive targets; others may congregate in unguarded 
places, making them attractive targets for predators who 
come on school grounds.49 Currently:
Among students ages 12 to 18, there are about 1.7 
 
■
million victims of nonfatal crimes at school, including 
900,000 thefts and 800,000 violent crimes (simple 
assault and serious violent crime).
About 8 percent of students in grades 9 to 12 report 
 
■
being threatened or injured with a weapon in the 
previous 12 months, and 22 percent report that 
illegal drugs were made available to them on school 
property.
About 86 percent of public schools report that at least 
 
■
one violent crime, theft, or other crime occurred at their 
school during the past 12 months.50
The Victim’s Household
The NCVS tells us that within the United States, larger 
homes, African American homes, urban homes, and those 
in the West are the most vulnerable to crime. In contrast, 
rural homes, white homes, and those in the Northeast are 
the least likely to contain crime victims or be the target of 
theft offenses, such as burglary or larceny. People who own 
their homes are less vulnerable than renters.
Recent population movement and changes may ac-
count for decreases in crime victimization. U.S. residents 
have become extremely mobile, moving from urban areas to 
suburban and rural areas. In addition, family size has been 
reduced; more people than ever before are living in single-
person homes (about one-quarter of the population). It is 
possible that the decline in household victimization rates 
during the past decades can be explained by the fact that 
smaller households in less populated areas have a lower vic-
timization risk.
Victim Characteristics
Social and demographic characteristics also distinguish vic-
tims and nonvictims. The most important of these factors 
are gender, age, social status, and race.
While the number and rate of victimization have de-
clined, patterns in the victimization survey findings are 
stable and repetitive, suggesting that victimization is not 
random but is a function of personal and ecological factors. 
The stability of these patterns allows us to make judgments 
about the nature of victimization; policies can then be cre-
ated in an effort to reduce the victimization rate. Who are 
victims? Where does victimization take place? What is the 
relationship between victims and criminals? The following 
sections discuss some of the most important victimization 
patterns and trends.
The Social Ecology of Victimization
The NCVS shows that violent crimes are slightly more 
likely to take place in an open, public area (such as a street, 
a park, or a fi eld), in a school building, or at a commercial 
establishment such as a tavern during the daytime or early 
evening hours than in a private home during the morning 
or late evening hours. The more serious violent crimes, 
such as rape and aggravated assault, typically take place af-
ter 6 P.M. Approximately two-thirds of rapes and sexual as-
saults occur at night—6 P.M. to 6 A.M. Less serious forms of 
violence, such as unarmed robberies and personal larcenies 
like purse snatching, are more likely to occur during the 
daytime. Neighborhood characteristics affect the chances of 
victimization. Those living in the central city have signifi -
cantly higher rates of theft and violence than suburbanites; 
people living in rural areas have a victimization rate almost

65 experience only 2 per 1,000. As shown in Figure 3.4, 
teens and young adults experience the highest rates of vio-
lent crime. Violent crime rates declined in recent years for 
most age groups.
Elderly Victims Although the elderly are less likely to be-
come crime victims than the young, they are most often the 
victims of a narrow band of criminal activities from which 
the young are more immune. Frauds and scams, purse 
snatching, pocket picking, stealing checks from the mail, 
and committing crimes in long-term care settings claim 
more older than younger victims. The elderly are especially 
susceptible to fraud schemes because they have insurance, 
pension plans, proceeds from the sale of homes, and money 
from Social Security and savings that make them attractive 
fi nancial targets. Because many elderly live by themselves 
and are lonely, they remain more susceptible to telephone 
and mail fraud. Unfortunately, once victimized, the elderly 
have more limited opportunities either to recover their lost 
money or to earn enough to replace what they have lost.53
Another emerging problem is the rising number of el-
derly living in long-term care facilities. There is much that 
is unknown about the abuse and criminal victimization of 
adults living in residential care facilities, but what is known 
is troubling. While a national survey of elderly care facilities 
is being planned for the future, there is little question that 
the environment at many residential care facilities across the 
country warrants the attention of all individuals working to 
help adults live with dignity and respect. Available data sug-
gest that adults are victimized at an alarming rate, and often 
have much more diffi culty participating in the criminal jus-
tice system and receiving the help they need.54
Gender As Figure 3.3 shows, gender affects victimization risk. 
Except for the crimes of rape and sexual assault, males are more 
likely than females to be the victims of violent crime. Men are 
almost twice as likely as women to experience robbery. Women, 
however, are six times more likely than men to be victims of 
rape, domestic violence, and sexual assault. Although males are 
more likely to be victimized than females, the gender differences 
in the victimization rate have narrowed signifi cantly over time.
One significant gender difference is that women are 
much more likely to be victimized by someone they know or 
with whom they live. Of those offenders victimizing females, 
about two-thirds were described as someone the victim knew 
or was related to. In contrast, fewer than half of male victims 
were attacked by a friend, relative, or acquaintance.
While women are more likely to be the target of domes-
tic assaults, intimate partner violence seems to be declin-
ing. One reason may be an increasing amount of economic 
and political opportunities for women: research shows that 
economic inequality is signifi cantly related to female victim-
ization rates. As more laws or acts favorable to women are 
passed and more economic opportunities become available, 
the lower their rates of violent victimization.51
Age Victim data reveal that young people face a much 
greater victimization risk than do older persons. Even the 
youngest kids are not immune: David Finkelhor and his 
colleagues found that when compared to older siblings, 
younger children were just as likely to be hit with an object 
that could cause injury and were just as likely to be victim-
ized on multiple occasions and suffer similar injuries.52
Victim risk diminishes rapidly after age 25: teens 16 to 
19 suffer 45 violent crimes per 1,000, whereas people over

Adolescents and teens, who have the highest victimiza-
 
■
tion risk, are too young to have been married.
Young single people go out in public more often and 
 
■
sometimes interact with high-risk peers, increasing their 
exposure to victimization.
Widows and widowers suffer much lower victimization 
 
■
rates because they are older, interact with older people, 
and are more likely to stay home at night and to avoid 
public places.
Race and Ethnicity As Figure 3.5 shows, (a) African 
Americans are more likely than whites to be victims of vio-
lent crime, and (b) serious violent crime rates have declined 
in recent years for both blacks and whites.
Why do these discrepancies exist? Because of income 
inequality, racial and minority group members are often 
forced to live in deteriorated urban areas beset by alcohol 
and drug abuse, poverty, racial discrimination, and violence. 
Consequently, their lifestyle places them in the most at-risk 
population group. However, as Figure 3.5 shows, the rate of 
black victimization has been in steep decline, and the racial 
gap in victimization rates seems to be narrowing.
Repeat Victimization Does prior victimization enhance 
or reduce the chances of future victimization? Individuals 
who have been crime victims have a significantly higher 
chance of future victimization than people who have not 
been victims.57 Households that have experienced victim-
ization in the past are the ones most likely to experience it 
again in the future.58
What factors predict chronic victimization? Most repeat 
victimizations occur soon after a previous crime has occurred, 
suggesting that repeat victims share some personal character-
istic that makes them a magnet for predators.59 For example, 
children who are shy, physically weak, or socially isolated may 
be prone to being bullied in the schoolyard.60 David Finkel-
hor and Nancy Asigian have found that three specifi c types of 
characteristics increase the potential for victimization:
Target vulnerability. 
 
■
The victims’ physical weakness or 
psychological distress renders them incapable of resist-
ing or deterring crime and makes them easy targets.
Target gratifi ability. 
 
■
Some victims have some quality, 
possession, skill, or attribute that an offender wants to 
obtain, use, have access to, or manipulate. Having at-
tractive possessions such as a leather coat may make 
one vulnerable to predatory crime.
Target antagonism. 
 
■
Some characteristics increase risk 
because they arouse anger, jealousy, or destructive im-
pulses in potential offenders. Being gay or effeminate, 
for example, may bring on undeserved attacks in the 
street; being argumentative and alcoholic may provoke 
barroom assaults.61
Repeat victimization may occur when the victim does 
not take defensive action. For example, if an abusive hus-
band fi nds out that his battered wife will not call the police, 
It is the mission of the Crime Victims Board of 
New York to provide compensation to innocent 
victims of crime in a timely, efficient, and compassionate 
manner; to fund direct services to crime victims via a 
network of community-based programs; and to advocate 
for the rights and benefits of all innocent victims of 
crime. For more information about the compensation to 
victims of crime, visit the Criminal Justice CourseMate at 
cengagebrain.com, then access the “Web Links” for this 
chapter.
Elder abuse is a particularly important issue because of 
shifts in the U.S. population; the Bureau of the Census pre-
dicts that by 2030 the population over age 65 will nearly 
triple to more than 70 million people, and older people will 
make up more than 20 percent of the population (up from 
12.3 percent in 1990). The saliency of elder abuse is under-
scored by reports from the National Center on Elder Abuse, 
which show an increase of 150 percent in reported cases of 
elder abuse nationwide since 1986.55
The association between age and victimization is un-
doubtedly tied to lifestyle: adolescents often stay out 
late at night, go to public places, and hang out with 
other kids who have a high risk of criminal involve-
ment. Teens also face a high victimization risk because 
they spend a great deal of time in the most danger-
ous building in the community—the local school. As 
Chapter 2 indicated, adolescents have the highest crime 
rates. It is not surprising that people who associate with 
these high-crime-rate individuals (other adolescents) 
have the greatest victimization risk.
CONNECTIONS
Social Status The poorest Americans are also the most 
likely victims of violent and property crime. For example, 
homeless people, who are among the poorest individuals in 
America, suffer very high rates of assault.56 This association 
occurs across all gender, age, and racial groups. Although the 
poor are more likely to suffer violent crimes, the wealthy are 
more likely targets of personal theft crimes such as pocket 
picking and purse snatching. Perhaps the affl uent—sporting 
more expensive attire and driving better cars—attract the 
 attention of thieves.
Marital Status Marital status also infl uences victimization 
risk. Never-married males and females are victimized more 
often than married people. Widows and widowers have the 
lowest victimization risk. This association between marital 
status and victimization is probably infl uenced by age, gen-
der, and lifestyle:

report that substance abuse is involved in about one-third of 
violent crime incidents.65
Although many violent crimes are committed by strang-
ers, a surprising number of violent crimes are committed 
by relatives or acquaintances of the victims. In fact, more 
than half of all nonfatal personal crimes are committed by 
people who are described as being known to the victim. 
Women are especially vulnerable to people they know. More 
than 60 percent of rape or sexual assault victims state the 
offender was an intimate, a relative, a friend, or an acquain-
tance. Women are more likely than men to be robbed by a 
friend or acquaintance; most males report that the people 
who robbed them were strangers.
THEORIES OF 
VICTIMIZATION
For many years, criminological theory focused on the ac-
tions of the criminal offender; the role of the victim was 
virtually ignored. But more than 50 years ago, scholars

he repeatedly victimizes her; or if a hate 
crime is committed and the police do not 
respond to reported offenses, the perpetra-
tors learn they have little to fear from the 
law.62 Women who fight back and/or use 
self-protective action during the fi rst inci-
dent of sexual battering reduce their likeli-
hood of being a recurrent victim.63
Of course, not all victims are repeaters. 
Some take defensive measures to lessen 
their chance of future victimizations. Some 
may change their lifestyle, take fewer risks, 
and cut back on associating with dangerous 
people; once burnt, twice shy.64
Victims and Their Criminals
The victim data also tell us something about 
the relationship between victims and crimi-
nals. Males are more likely to be violently 
victimized by a stranger, and females are 
more likely to be victimized by a friend, an 
acquaintance, or an intimate. As the Profi les 
in Crime feature shows, what it means to be 
victimized by an acquaintance may take on a 
whole different meaning in the Internet age.
Victims report that most crimes are 
committed by a single offender over age 20. 
Crime tends to be intraracial: black offend-
ers victimize blacks, and whites victimize 
whites. However, because the country’s population is pre-
dominantly white, it stands to reason that criminals of all 
races will be more likely to target white victims. Victims

80  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
In 1971, Menachem Amir suggested female rape victims 
often contribute to their attacks by dressing provocatively 
or pursuing a relationship with the rapist.68 Although 
Amir’s fi ndings are controversial, courts have continued 
to return not-guilty verdicts in rape cases if a victim’s ac-
tions can in any way be construed as consenting to sexual 
intimacy.69
Passive precipitation occurs when the victim exhib-
its some personal characteristic that unknowingly either 
threatens or encourages the attacker. Although the victim 
may never have met the attacker or even know of his or 
her existence, the attacker feels menaced and acts accord-
ingly.70 In some instances, the crime can occur because 
of personal confl ict—for example, when two people com-
pete over a job, promotion, love interest, or some other 
scarce and coveted commodity. A woman may become 
the target of domestic violence when she increases her job 
status and her success results in a backlash from a jealous 
spouse or partner.71
began to realize that the victim is not a passive target in 
crime, but someone whose behavior can influence his 
or her own fate, someone who “shapes and molds the 
criminal.”66 These early works helped focus attention on 
the role of the victim in the crime problem and led to fur-
ther research efforts that have sharpened the image of the 
crime victim. Today a number of different theories attempt 
to explain the causes of victimization; the most important 
are discussed here.
Victim Precipitation Theory
According to victim precipitation theory, some people 
may actually initiate the confrontation that eventually leads 
to their injury or death. Victim precipitation can be either 
active or passive.
Active precipitation occurs when victims act provoca-
tively, use threats or fi ghting words, or even attack fi rst.67
a series of 10 questions. The questions al-
legedly asked for body measurements and 
details, past sexual experiences, and cur-
rent sexual fantasies, and were designed to 
elicit intimate and embarrassing personal 
information from the victims. As soon as he 
had acquired the information, Vance would 
demand that the victims provide him with 
their confidential sign-on information for 
various interactive computer services, such 
as Facebook, MySpace, Hotmail, and Ya-
hoo, and/or digital still images or webcam 
video of themselves in various states of un-
dress, exposing themselves, or engaging in 
sexually explicit conduct. He allegedly told 
victims that if they did not comply with his 
demands, he would injure their reputations 
by transmitting the intimate and embar-
rassing personal information about them to 
other people, including their peers, church 
members, and employers. Vance some-
times approached his victims by posing as 
one of their own family members, friends, 
or online contacts. Under that guise, Vance 
would allegedly send an e-mail or instant 
message to one victim using another vic-
tim’s account, pretending that the sender 
could not access her Facebook or MySpace 
account and needed to borrow the recipi-
ent’s account sign-on information in order to 
address the problem. Once he had obtained 
access to his victims’ accounts, Vance 
would change the passwords, effectively 
holding the accounts hostage. He would 
then inform the victims of the trick and de-
mand that they send him digital images or 
webcam video transmissions of themselves 
in various states of undress, nude, or en-
gaging in sexually explicit conduct, in order 
to regain access to their accounts. Some 
victims complied with Vance’s demands, 
though others did not. Most of the threaten-
ing communications were allegedly sent via 
the America Online (AOL) Instant Messen-
ger service (AIM).

Vance used the Internet and a number

social networking sites, where he used false

at social events at local churches and oth-

to be a family member, friend, or acquain-

by initiating a game in which he would pose 
as an anonymous long-lost friend or secret 
admirer who would only reveal his true

CHAPTER 3 | Victims and Victimization  81
People who belong to groups that have an extremely 
risky life—homeless, runaways, drug users—are at high 
risk for victimization; the more time they are exposed to 
street life, the greater their risk of becoming crime vic-
tims.76 When Kimberly Tyler and Morgan Beal interviewed 
more than 100 homeless youth in midwestern cities, they 
found that personal and behavioral characteristics helped 
put them in danger for physical and sexual abuse. Those 
who ran away at an earlier age, did it more often, slept on 
the street, panhandled, and hung out with deviant peers 
rather than protective family members were the ones most 
likely to suffer physical victimization. Sexual victimization 
risk was elevated if the homeless youth was a female, had 
an unkempt and disheveled appearance, and had friends 
who were willing to trade sex for money.77 Tyler and Beal’s 
research shows that not only does lifestyle promote vic-
timization, but there is significant behavioral variation 
within lifestyle groupings that can elevate victimization 
risk even more.
Others are exposed to risk because of their status. 
Teenage males have an extremely high victimization risk 
because their lifestyle places them at risk both at school 
and once they leave the school grounds.78 They spend a 
great deal of time hanging out with friends and pursuing 
recreational fun.79 Their friends may give them a false ID 
so they can go drinking in the neighborhood bar, or they 
may hang out in taverns at night, which places them at 
risk because many fi ghts and assaults occur in places that 
serve liquor.
Passive precipitation may also 
occur when the victim belongs to a 
group whose mere presence threat-
ens the attacker’s reputation, status, 
or economic well-being. For example, 
hate-crime violence may be precipi-
tated by immigrant group members 
arriving in the community to com-
pete for jobs and housing. Research 
indicates that passive precipitation is 
related to power: if the target group 
can establish themselves economically 
or gain political power in the commu-
nity, their vulnerability will diminish. 
They are still a potential threat, but 
they become too formidable a target to 
attack; they are no longer passive pre-
cipitators.72 By implication, economic 
power reduces victimization risk.
Victim Impulsivity Perhaps there is 
something about victims’ personality 
traits that incite attacks. A number of 
research efforts have found that both 
male and female victims have an im-
pulsive personality that might render 
them abrasive and obnoxious, char-
acteristics that might incite victimization.73 People who are 
impulsive and lack self-control are less likely to have a high 
tolerance for frustration and a physical rather than mental 
orientation; they are less likely to practice risk avoidance. It 
is possible that impulsive people are not only antagonistic 
and therefore more likely to become targets, but they also 
are risk takers who get involved in dangerous situations and 
fail to take precautions.74
Lifestyle Theory
Some criminologists believe people may become crime 
victims because their lifestyle increases their exposure to 
criminal offenders. Victimization risk is increased by such 
behaviors as associating with young men, going out in pub-
lic places late at night, and living in an urban area. Con-
versely, one’s chances of victimization can be reduced by 
staying home at night, moving to a rural area, staying out 
of public places, earning more money, and getting married. 
The basis of lifestyle theory is that crime is not a random 
occurrence but rather a function of the victim’s lifestyle. For 
example, due to their lifestyle and demographic makeup, 
college campuses contain large concentrations of young 
women who may be at greater risk for rape and other forms 
of sexual assault than women in the general population. Sin-
gle women who drink frequently and have a prior history of 
being sexually assaulted are most likely to be assaulted on 
campus.75

Though females are more likely to be victimized by a friend, an acquaintance, or an intimate, 
some are harmed by strangers. In a case that made national headlines, ESPN reporter Erin 
Andrews was stalked and spied upon by a deranged admirer who used a spy cam to take nude 
photographs of her that he then placed on the Internet. Her attacker, Michael David Barrett, 
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison.

violent friends are more likely to begin engaging in antisocial 
behavior themselves and suffer psychological defi cits.87 Ex-
periencing victimization brings on retaliation, creating a nev-
er-ending cycle of violence begetting even more violence.88
The association between victimization and criminal life-
style may be more one of risk than propensity: people who 
are involved in crime are constantly exposed to dangerous 
people who elevate their victimization risk. Considering the 
risk criminals take and the likelihood they will become vic-
tims themselves, what impact does victimization have on a 
criminal career? Does it encourage more crime and bloody 
retaliation or does it result in rethinking the dangers of a 
criminal way of life? The Criminological Enterprise feature 
helps answer this question.
Deviant Place Theory
According to deviant place theory, the greater their ex-
posure to dangerous places, the more likely people will 
become victims of crime and violence.89 Victims do not en-
courage crime, but are victim prone because they reside in 
socially disorganized high-crime areas where they have the 
greatest risk of coming into contact with criminal offend-
ers, irrespective of their own behavior or lifestyle.90 The 
more often victims visit dangerous places, the more likely 
they will be exposed to crime and violence.91 Neighborhood 
crime levels, then, may be more important for determining 
the chances of victimization than individual characteristics. 
Consequently, there may be little reason for residents in 
lower-class areas to alter their lifestyle or take safety precau-
tions because personal behavior choices do not infl uence 
the likelihood of victimization.92
Deviant places are poor, densely populated, highly tran-
sient neighborhoods in which commercial and residential 
property exist side by side.93 The commercial property pro-
vides criminals with easy targets for theft crimes, such as 
shoplifting and larceny. Successful people stay out of these 
stigmatized areas; they are homes for “demoralized kinds of 
people” who are easy targets for crime: the homeless, the 
addicted, the retarded, and the elderly poor.94 People who 
live in more affl uent areas and take safety precautions sig-
nifi cantly lower their chances of becoming crime victims; 
the effect of safety precautions is less pronounced in poor 
areas. Residents of poor areas have a much greater risk of 
becoming victims because they live near many motivated of-
fenders; to protect themselves, they have to try harder to be 
safe than the more affl uent.95
Sociologist William Julius Wilson has described how 
people who can afford to leave dangerous areas do so. He 
suggests that affl uent people realize that criminal victimiza-
tion can be avoided by moving to an area with greater law 
enforcement and lower crime rates. Because there are signif-
icant interracial income differences, white residents are able 
to fl ee inner-city high-crime areas, leaving members of racial 
minorities behind to suffer high victimization rates.96
College Lifestyle College students maintain a high-risk 
lifestyle—partying, taking recreational drugs—that makes 
them victimization prone.80 Bonnie Fisher and her col-
leagues surveyed thousands of college students and found 
that college women face the risk of sexual assault at a higher 
rate than women in the general population.81 Fisher and her 
colleagues found that 90 percent of the victims knew the 
person who sexually victimized them. Most often this was a 
boyfriend, ex-boyfriend, classmate, friend, acquaintance, or 
coworker; college professors were not identifi ed as commit-
ting any rapes or sexual coercions. The vast majority of sex-
ual victimizations occurred in the evening (after 6:00 P.M.), 
typically (60 percent) in the students’ living quarters; many 
were connected to drinking. Other common crime scenes 
were other living quarters on campus and fraternity houses 
(about 10 percent). Off-campus sexual victimizations, es-
pecially rapes, also occurred in residences. Incidents where 
women were threatened or touched also took place in set-
tings such as bars, dance clubs or nightclubs, and work set-
tings. Research confirms that young women who involve 
themselves in substance abuse and come into contact with 
men who are also substance abusers increase the likelihood 
that they will be sexual assault victims.82
The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) was 
established by the 1984 Victims of Crime Act 
(VOCA) to oversee diverse programs that benefit victims 
of crime. The OVC provides substantial funding to state 
victim assistance and compensation programs and 
supports training designed to educate criminal justice 
and allied professionals regarding the rights and needs 
of crime victims. Learn more about assistance to victims 
of crime by visiting the Criminal Justice CourseMate at 
cengagebrain.com, then access the “Web Links” for this 
chapter.
Criminal Lifestyle Not surprisingly, getting involved in 
criminality also increases the chance of victimization. The 
perils of a deviant lifestyle do not end in adolescence and 
haunt risk takers through their life. Kids with a history of 
family violence and involvement in crime increase their 
chances of becoming the victims of homicide as adults.83 
Kids who take drugs and carry weapons in their adoles-
cence maintain a greater chance of being shot and killed as 
adults.84
Take for instance gang boys, a group at high risk for vic-
timization. The gang lifestyle—engaging in serious crime 
and delinquency, carrying guns, selling drugs, retaliating 
against perceived slights or disrespect—typifi es behaviors 
that signifi cantly increase the chances of becoming the vic-
tim of violent crimes. Protecting the gang’s turf and engag-
ing in retaliatory vendettas to maintain the gang’s reputation 
also increase the risk of personal victimization.85 Gang boys 
are much more likely to own guns and associate with violent 
peers than nonmembers.86 Those who choose aggressive or

CHAPTER 3 | Victims and Victimization  83
The presence of these components increases the likelihood 
that a predatory crime will take place. Targets are more 
likely to be victimized if they are poorly guarded and ex-
posed to a large group of motivated offenders, such as teen-
age boys.98 As targets increase in value and availability, so 
too should crime rates. Conversely, as the resale value of for-
merly pricey goods such as iPods and cell phones declines, 
so too should burglary rates.99
Increasing the number of motivated offenders and plac-
ing them in close proximity to valuable goods will increase 
victimization levels. Even after-school programs, designed 
to reduce criminal activity, may produce higher crime rates 
because they lump together motivated offenders—teen 
boys—with vulnerable victims (other teen boys).100 Young 
women who drink to excess in bars and frat houses may 
Routine Activities Theory
Routine activities theory was fi rst articulated in a series of 
papers by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson.97 They con-
cluded that the volume and distribution of predatory crime 
(violent crimes against a person and crimes in which an of-
fender attempts to steal an object directly) are closely related 
to the interaction of three variables that refl ect the routine 
activities of the typical American lifestyle (see Figure 3.6):
The availability of 
 
■
suitable targets, such as homes con-
taining easily salable goods
The absence of 
 
■
capable guardians, such as police, 
home owners, neighbors, friends, and relatives
The presence of 
 
■
motivated offenders, such as a large 
number of unemployed teenagers
funeral battered and sporting a black eye. 
When Pete’s extended family saw his black 
eye at the funeral and consoled him, Pete 
experienced regret and shame. As Pete 
puts it, “That’s the thing in my life that I re-
gret most in my life ever, having my whole 
entire family having to see me all beat up 
because I was selling weed.” Shame and 
regret related to victimization and drug 
dealing strengthened his bond to his family 
and thereby reduce the probability of future 
drug dealing.
Just before he was victimized, Christian 
recognized that he had lost control of his 
life and said to himself, “Why . . . am I do-
ing this? I’m about to get robbed. Why am 
I doing this?’” Christian could not find the 
strength to stop himself from doing a drug 
deal that he predicted would result in his 
own victimization. He thought about finding 
his attacker and getting revenge, but Chris-
tian did not want to take the chance of get-
ting shot. He wasn’t into physical violence, 
so he did not find the adaptation of retali-
ation to be an attractive option. Although 
victimization did not result in Christian in-
stantly terminating his illicit activity, the de-
sistance process was set in motion because 
he started to reevaluate the benefits and 
costs of dealing in relation to alternative 
lines of available action. Christian consid-
ered that he was 18 years of age and thus 
no longer a minor, that he was going to col-
lege soon, that the profit of dealing was not 
large enough to offset the risks, and that it 
was time for him to go and make something 
of himself. In the end, Christian decided 
that dealing was too hazardous and that 
termination was the best course of action.
CRITICAL THINKING
Jacques and Wright find that for some 
criminals, victimization is an eye-opening 
event, helping them choose to desist from 
crime. This transition is aided by a number 
of factors ranging from attachment to fam-
ily and friends, to belief that there are al-
ternatives to criminality. However, it is the 
victimization event that is the catalyst for 
the decision to transition out of crime. Do 
you agree with their assessment? Or might 
victimization breed anger, resentment, and 
vengeance?

ogy 46 (2008): 47–91.
Escalation or Desistance: The Effect of 
Victimization on Criminal Careers
What happens when a criminal experiences 
victimization? Does it encourage further 
criminal activities or, conversely, might the 
experience help convince a career criminal 
to choose another career?
Recent research by Scott Jacques and 
Richard Wright shows that for at least one 
set of criminal offenders—drug dealers—
becoming a crime victim sets the stage 
for their breaking away from their chosen 
profession and transitioning into a new 
life course. This unexpected life event is a 
“break from the customary” and may lead 
to “a disturbance of habit in which a cus-
tomary behavior can no longer be main-
tained,” namely, drug dealing. They find 
that serious victimizations help drug dealers 
realize that they better begin thinking about  
transitioning out of crime. Terminating drug 
dealing is an adaptation that allows them to 
gain control over their lives and to reduce 
the probability of future victimization.
Jacques and Wright tested their views 
with interviews with two drug sellers, Pete 
and Christian. Both were in their early 20s, 
enrolled in college, and had never been ar-
rested. Each told about the incident that re-
sulted in their terminating their drug-dealing 
careers. Pete was robbed and beaten. He 
was forced to show up at a family member’s

84  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
Conversely, people can reduce their chances 
of victimization if they adopt a lifestyle that 
limits their exposure to danger: by getting 
married, having children, and moving to a 
small town.102
Guardianship Even the most motivated 
offenders may ignore valuable targets if they 
are well guarded. Despite containing valuable 
commodities, private homes and/or public 
businesses may be considered off-limits by 
seasoned criminals if they are well protected 
by capable guardians and efficient security 
systems.103
Criminals are also aware of police guard-
ianship. In order to convince them that crime 
does not pay, more cops can be put on the 
street. Proactive, aggressive law enforcement 
offi cers who quickly get to the scene of the 
crime help deter criminal activities.104
Hot Spots Motivated people—such as 
teenage males, drug users, and unemployed 
adults—are the ones most likely to commit 
crime. If they congregate in a particular neigh-
borhood, it becomes a “hot spot” for crime and 
violence. People who live in these hot spots 
elevate their chances of victimization. For ex-
ample, people who live in public housing proj-
ects may have high victimization rates because 
their fellow residents, mostly indigent, are ex-
tremely motivated to commit crime.105 Yet mo-
tivated criminals must have the opportunity to 
fi nd suitable undefended targets before they 
commit crime. Even the most desperate crimi-
nal might hesitate to attack a well-defended 
target, whereas a group of teens might rip off 
an unoccupied home on the spur of the mo-
ment.106 In hot spots for crime, therefore, an 
undefended yet attractive target becomes an 
irresistible objective for motivated criminals. 
Given these principles, it is not surprising that 
people who (a) live in high-crime areas and (b) 
go out late at night (c) carrying valuables such 
as an expensive watch and (d) engage in risky 
behavior such as drinking alcohol, (e) with-
out friends or family to watch or help them, 
have a signifi cant chance of becoming crime 
victims.107
The Criminological Enterprise feature 
shows how changes in lifestyle can contribute 
to victimization.
Support for Routine Activities Theory Research sup-
ports many facets of routine activities theory. Cohen and 
Felson themselves found that crime rates increased between 
elevate their risk of date rape because (a) they are per-
ceived as easy targets, and (b) their attackers can rational-
ize the attack because they view intoxication as a sign of 
immorality (“She’s loose, so I didn’t think she’d care”).101

CHAPTER 3 | Victims and Victimization  85
Routine Activities and Lifestyle Routine activities the-
ory and the lifestyle approach have a number of similarities. 
They both assume that a person’s living arrangements can af-
fect victim risk and that people who live in unguarded areas 
are at the mercy of motivated offenders. These two theories 
both rely on four basic concepts: (1) proximity to criminals, 
(2) time of exposure to criminals, (3) target attractiveness, 
and (4) guardianship.111
Based on the same basic concepts, these theories 
share five predictions: People increase their victimiza-
tion risk if they (1) live in high-crime areas, (2) go out 
late at night, (3) carry valuables such as an expensive 
watch, (4) engage in risky behavior such as drinking al-
cohol, and (5) are without friends or family to watch or 
help them.112
The various theories of victimization are summarized in 
Concept Summary 3.1.
1960 and 1980 because the number of adult caretakers 
at home during the day (guardians) decreased as a result 
of increased female participation in the workforce. While 
mothers are at work and children in day care, homes are left 
unguarded. Similarly, with the growth of suburbia and the 
decline of the traditional neighborhood, the number of such 
familiar guardians as family, neighbors, and friends dimin-
ished.108 Steven Messner and his associates found that as 
adult unemployment rates increase, juvenile homicide arrest 
rates decrease. One possible reason for this phenomenon: 
it is possible that juvenile arrests decrease because unem-
ployed adults are at home to supervise their children and 
make sure they do not get in trouble or join gangs.109 The 
availability and cost of easily transportable goods has also 
been shown to infl uence victimization rates: as the costs of 
goods such as mobile phones and camcorders declined, so 
too did burglary rates.110
shoplifting and employee pilferage. Sub-
stantial numbers of cars are parked in ar-
eas that make larceny and car theft virtually 
undetectable. Cars that carry away stolen 
merchandise have an undistinguished ap-
pearance: who notices people placing items 
in a car in a shopping mall lot? Also, shop-
pers can be attacked in parking lots as they 
walk in isolation to and from their cars. As 
car ownership increases, teens have greater 
access to transportation outside parental 
control. So while victimization rates in ur-
ban areas are still higher, routine activities 
in the suburbs may also produce the risk of 
victimization. Felson has set out the factors 
that increase the likelihood of victimization 
as the features of metropolitan living have 
spread to the suburbs:
It has become more difficult to protect 
 
■
people from criminal entry because 
homes have been dispersed over larger 
areas, huge parking lots have been cre-
ated, and building heights lowered.
By spreading people and vehicles over 
 
■
larger areas as they travel and park, 
people are more exposed to attack.
There are fewer people in each house-
 
■
hold and consequently less intrapersonal 
and intrafamily supervision.
As shopping, work, and socializing are 
 
■
spread further from home, people are 
forced to leave their immediate neigh-
borhood, and, as strangers, they be-
come more vulnerable to attack.
By spreading vast quantities of retail 
 
■
goods throughout huge stores and malls, 
with fewer employees to watch over 
them, the divergent metropolis creates a 
retail environment that invites people of 
all ages to shoplift.
Commuting to the inner city for work 
 
■
requires that millions of dollars’ worth of 
vehicles be left in parking lots without 
supervision.
CRITICAL THINKING
Does routine activities theory merely de-
scribe why people become victims rather 
than get at the heart of the matter: why are 
there motivated offenders? If people are 
motivated to commit crime, where does 
their motivation come from?

and Everyday Life: Insights and Implications

Crime and Everyday Life
According to Marcus Felson, crime began to 
increase in the United States as the country 
changed from a nation of small villages and 
towns to one of large urban environments. 
Because metropolitan areas provide a criti-
cal population mass, predatory criminals 
are better able to hide and evade appre-
hension. After committing crime, criminals 
can blend into the crowd, disperse their 
loot, and make a quick escape using the 
public transportation system.
As the population became more urban, 
the middle class, fearing criminal victimiza-
tion, fled to the suburbs. Rather than being 
safe from crime, the suburbs produced a 
unique set of routine activities that promote 
victimization risk. In many families, both 
parents are likely to commute to work, leav-
ing teens unsupervised. Affluent kids own 
or drive cars, date, and socialize with peers 
in unsupervised settings, all behaviors that 
are related to both crime and victimization.
The downtown shopping district was 
replaced by the suburban shopping mall. 
Here, strangers converge in large numbers 
and youths hang out. The interior is filled 
with people, so drug deals can be con-
cealed in the pedestrian flow. Stores have 
attractively displayed goods, encouraging

86  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
CONCEPT SUMMARY 3.1
Victimization Theories
Major Premise
Strengths of the Theory
Research Focus of the Theory
Victim precipitation
The major premise of victim 
precipitation theory is that 
victims trigger criminal acts by 
their provocative behavior. Active 
precipitation involves fighting 
words or gestures. Passive 
precipitation occurs when 
victims unknowingly threaten 
their attacker.
The strength of the theory 
is that it explains multiple 
victimizations: if people 
precipitate crime, it follows that 
they will become repeat victims 
if their behavior persists over 
time.
The research focuses of the theory are 
the victim’s role, crime provocation, 
and the victim–offender relationship.
Lifestyle 
The major premise of lifestyle 
theory is that victimization risk 
is increased when people have 
a high-risk lifestyle. Placing 
oneself at risk by going out to 
dangerous places results in 
increased victimization.
The strength of the theory is 
that it explains victimization 
patterns in the social structure. 
Males, young people, and the 
poor have high victimization 
rates because they have a 
higher-risk lifestyle than 
females, the elderly, and the 
affluent.
The research focuses of the theory are 
personal activities, peer relations, place 
of crime, and type of crime.
Deviant place
The major premise of deviant 
place theory is that victims do 
not encourage crime but are 
victim prone because they reside 
in socially disorganized high-
crime areas where they have 
the greatest risk of coming into 
contact with criminal offenders, 
irrespective of their own behavior 
or lifestyle.
The strength of the theory is 
that it shows why people with 
conventional lifestyles become 
crime victims in high-risk areas. 
Victimization is a function of 
place and location, not lifestyle 
and risk taking.
The research focus of the theory is 
victimization in high-crime, disorganized 
neighborhoods.
Routine activities
The major premise of routine 
activities theory is that crime 
rates can be explained by 
the availability of suitable 
targets, the absence of capable 
guardians, and the presence of 
motivated offenders.
The strengths of the theory 
are that it can explain crime 
rates and trends, it shows how 
victim behavior can influence 
criminal opportunity, and it 
suggests that victimization risk 
can be reduced by increasing 
guardianship and/or reducing 
target vulnerability.
The research focuses of the theory are 
opportunity to commit crime, effect of 
police and guardians, population shifts, 
and crime rates.
CARING FOR THE VICTIM
National victim surveys indicate that almost every Ameri-
can age 12 and over will one day become the victim of a 
common-law crime, such as larceny or burglary, and in 
the aftermath suffer fi nancial problems, mental stress, and 
physical hardship.113 Surveys show that more than 75 per-
cent of the general public has been victimized by crime at 
least once in their life; as many as 25 percent of the victims 
develop posttraumatic stress disorder, and their symptoms 
last for more than a decade after the crime occurred.114 The 
long-term effects of sexual victimization can include years 
of problem avoidance, social withdrawal, and self-criticism. 
Helping these victims adjust and improve their coping tech-
niques can be essential to their recovery.115 Law enforce-
ment agencies, courts, and correctional and human service 
systems have come to realize that due process and human 
rights exist for both the defendant and the victim of crimi-
nal behavior.

CHAPTER 3 | Victims and Victimization  87
In 1984, the federal government created the Victims of 
Crime Act (VOCA), which grants money to state compen-
sation boards derived from fi nes and penalties imposed on 
federal offenders. The money is distributed each year to the 
states to fund both their crime victim compensation pro-
grams and their victim assistance programs, such as rape 
crisis centers and domestic violence shelters. Victims of 
child abuse and victims of domestic violence receive most 
of the funds. VOCA money goes to support victims’ medi-
cal expenses, gives them economic support for lost wages, 
helps to compensate for the death of loved ones, and pro-
vides mental health counseling.124 Currently, this assistance 
amounts to $400 million per year.125
The Government’s Response 
to Victimization
Because of public concern over violent personal crime, 
President Ronald Reagan created a Task Force on Victims 
of Crime in 1982.116 This group suggested that a balance be 
achieved between recognizing the victim’s rights and pro-
viding the defendant with due process. Recommendations 
included providing witnesses and victims with protection 
from intimidation, requiring restitution in criminal cases, 
developing guidelines for fair treatment of crime victims 
and witnesses, and expanding programs of victim compen-
sation.117 Consequently, the Omnibus Victim and Witness 
Protection Act was passed, which required the use of victim 
impact statements at sentencing in federal criminal cases, 
greater protection for witnesses, more stringent bail laws, 
and the use of restitution in criminal cases.
In 1984, the Comprehensive Crime Control Act and the 
Victims of Crime Act authorized federal funding for state vic-
tim compensation and assistance projects.118 With these acts, 
the federal government began to address the plight of the 
victim and make victim assistance an even greater concern 
of the public and the justice system. In 2004, the Justice for 
All Act modifi ed existing federal law and created a new set 
of rights for victims (Exhibit 3.1), including the right to be 
protected from the accused in their case and to be informed 
of their release. Legal expert Michael O’Hear fi nds that the 
Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004 can be viewed as an effort 
to promote victims’ rights as a counterweight to defendants’ 
rights, illustrating both the public’s hostility to defendants 
and its skepticism of the traditional lawyer- and judge-domi-
nated legal system, which they feel is too liberal.119
Due to this recognition of the needs of victims, an es-
timated 2,000 victim-witness assistance programs have 
developed around the United States.120 Victim-witness as-
sistance programs are organized on a variety of governmen-
tal levels and serve a variety of clients. We will look at the 
most prominent forms of victim services operating in the 
United States.121
Victim Compensation One of the primary goals of victim 
advocates has been to lobby for legislation creating crime 
victim compensation programs.122 As a result of such legis-
lation, the victim ordinarily receives compensation from the 
state to pay for damages associated with the crime. Rarely 
are two compensation schemes alike, however, and many 
state programs suffer from lack of both adequate funding 
and proper organization within the criminal justice system. 
Compensation may be made for medical bills, loss of wages, 
loss of future earnings, and counseling. In the case of death, 
the victim’s survivors can receive burial expenses and aid 
for loss of support.123 Awards are typically in the $100 to 
$15,000 range. Occasionally programs will provide emer-
gency assistance to indigent victims until compensation is 
available. Emergency assistance may come in the form of 
food vouchers or replacement of prescription medicines.

National victim surveys indicate that almost every American age 12 
and over will one day become the victim of some crime, including 
serious violent crimes such as rape and murder. Victims and their 
families suffer financial problems, mental stress, and physical 
hardship. There have been nationwide efforts to help survivors cope 
with their loss. Here, on April 16, 2008, Leona Daniels touches a 
photograph of her son, murder victim Brant Daniels, during the 19th 
Annual Victims March on the Capitol in Sacramento, California. Daniels 
was among several hundred family members and friends of murder 
victims who attended the rally to call for tougher anticrime laws. Brant 
Daniels, a student at Fresno City College from Los Angeles, was 
murdered in a dispute over a video game in Fresno, May 7, 2007.

who had the assistance of an advocate were significantly 
more likely to have police reports taken, were less likely to 
be treated negatively by police offi cers, and reported less 
distress from their medical contact experiences.126
Court advocates prepare victims and witnesses by ex-
plaining court procedures: how to be a witness, how bail 
works, and what to do if the defendant makes a threat. Lack 
of such knowledge can cause confusion and fear, making 
some victims reluctant to testify in court procedures.
Many victim programs also provide transportation to 
and from court, and advocates may remain in the courtroom 
during hearings to explain procedures and provide support. 
Court escorts are particularly important for elderly and dis-
abled victims, victims of child abuse and assault, and victims 
who have been intimidated by friends or relatives of the de-
fendant. These types of services may be having a positive ef-
fect since recent research shows that victims may now be less 
traumatized by a court hearing than previously believed.127
Victim Counseling Numerous programs provide counsel-
ing and psychological support to help victims recover from 
the long-term trauma associated with a violent victimiza-
tion. Clients are commonly referred to the local network of 
public and private social service agencies that can provide 
emergency and long-term assistance with transportation, 
medical care, shelter, food, and clothing. In addition, more 
than half of victim programs provide crisis intervention 
to victims, many of whom feel isolated, vulnerable, and in 
need of immediate services. Some programs counsel at their 
offi ces, and others visit victims’ homes, the crime scene, or 
a hospital. Helping victims adjust is often a diffi cult process, 
and recent research has found little evidence that counseling 
efforts are as successful as previously hoped.128
Public Education More than half of all victim programs in-
clude public education to help familiarize the general public 
with their services and with other agencies that assist crime 
victims. In some instances, these are primary education pro-
grams, which teach methods of dealing with confl ict without 
resorting to violence. For example, school-based programs 
present information on spousal and dating abuse followed 
by discussions of how to reduce violent incidents.129
Crisis Intervention Most victim programs refer victims to 
specifi c services to help them recover from their ordeal. Cli-
ents are commonly referred to the local network of public and 
private social service agencies that provide emergency and 
long-term assistance with transportation, medical care, shel-
ter, food, and clothing. In addition, more than half of all vic-
tim programs provide crisis intervention for victims who feel 
isolated, vulnerable, and in need of immediate services. Some 
programs counsel at their offi ces; others visit victims in their 
homes, at the crime scene, or in the hospital. For example, the 
Good Samaritans program in Mobile County, Alabama, unites 
law enforcement and faith-based and community organiza-
tions to train and mobilize volunteers who can help crime vic-
tims. Good Samaritan volunteers provide services such as:
Victim Advocates Ensuring victims’ rights can involve an 
eclectic group of advocacy groups, some independent, others 
government sponsored, and some self-help. Advocates can 
be especially helpful when victims need to interact with the 
agencies of justice. For example, advocates can lobby police 
departments to keep investigations open as well as request 
the return of recovered stolen property. They can demand 
from prosecutors and judges protection from harassment and 
reprisals by, for example, making “no contact” a condition of 
bail. They can help victims make statements during sentenc-
ing hearings as well as probation and parole revocation pro-
cedures. Victim advocates can also interact with news media, 
making sure that reporting is accurate and that victim privacy 
is not violated. Victim advocates can be part of an indepen-
dent agency similar to a legal aid society. If successful, top-
notch advocates may eventually open private offi ces, similar 
to attorneys, private investigators, or jury consultants.
Some programs assign advocates to help victims under-
stand the operations of the justice system and guide them 
through the process. Victims of sexual assault may be as-
signed the assistance of a rape victim advocate to stand by 
their side as they negotiate the legal and medical systems that 
must process their case. Research shows that rape survivors

statements result in a higher rate of incarceration, but others 
fi nd that the statements are insignifi cant.134 One recent study 
by Joel Caplan found that the use of victim statements at pa-
role hearings had little infl uence on the decision process, and 
inmate release was based more on factors such as measures of 
institutional behavior, crime severity, and criminal history.135
Those who favor the use of impact statements argue that 
because the victim is harmed by the crime, he or she has 
the right to infl uence the outcome of the case. After all, the 
public prosecutor is allowed to make sentencing recommen-
dations because the public has been harmed by the crime. 
Logically, the harm suffered by the victim legitimizes his or 
her right to make sentencing recommendations.136
Victims and Self-Protection
Although the general public mostly approves of the police, 
fear of crime and concern about community safety have 
prompted some to become their own “police force,” taking 
an active role in community protection and citizen crime 
control groups.137 The more crime in an area, the greater 
the amount of fear and the more likely residents will be to 
engage in self-protective measures.138
Research indicates that a significant number of crimes 
may not be reported to police simply because victims prefer 
to take matters into their own hands.139 One manifestation of 
this trend is the concept of target hardening, or making one’s 
home and business crime-proof through locks, bars, alarms, 
and other devices.140 Other commonly used crime preven-
tion techniques include a fence or barricade at the entrance; 
a doorkeeper, guard, or receptionist in an apartment building; 
an intercom or phone to gain access to the building; surveil-
lance cameras; window bars; warning signs; and dogs chosen 
for their ability to guard the house. The use of these measures 
is inversely proportional to perception of neighborhood safety: 
people who fear crime are more likely to use crime prevention 
techniques. Although the true relationship is still unclear, there 
is mounting evidence that people who protect their homes are 
less likely to be victimized by property crimes.141 One study 
conducted in the Philadelphia area found that people who in-
stall burglar alarms are less likely to suffer burglary than those 
who forgo similar preventive measures.142
Fighting Back Some people take self-protection to its ul-
timate end by preparing to fi ght back when criminals attack 
them. How successful are victims when they resist? Research 
indicates that victims who fi ght back often frustrate their 
attackers but also face increased odds of being physically 
harmed during the attack.143 In some cases, fi ghting back 
decreases the odds of a crime being completed but increases 
the victim’s chances of injury.144 Resistance may draw the 
attention of bystanders and make a violent crime physically 
diffi cult to complete, but it can also cause offenders to esca-
late their violence.145
What about the use of firearms for self-protection? 
Again, there is no clear-cut answer. Each year, 2.5 million

Victim–Offender Reconciliation 
Programs
Victim–offender reconciliation programs (VORPs) use media-
tors to facilitate face-to-face encounters between victims and 
their attackers. The aim is to engage in direct negotiations that 
lead to restitution agreements and, possibly, reconciliation 
between the two parties involved.131 Hundreds of programs 
are currently in operation, and they handle thousands of cases 
per year. Designed at fi rst to address routine misdemeanors 
such as petty theft and vandalism, programs now commonly 
hammer out restitution agreements in more serious incidents 
such as residential burglary and even attempted murder.
The Victim–Offender Reconciliation Program 
(VORP) Information and Resource Center provides 
information on programs and training and provides 
technical assistance. For more information about 
restorative justice, visit the Criminal Justice CourseMate at 
cengagebrain.com, then access the “Web Links” for this 
chapter.
Reconciliation programs are based on the concept of 
restorative justice, which rejects punitive correctional 
measures in favor of viewing crimes of violence and 
theft as interpersonal confl icts that need to be settled in 
the community through noncoercive means. See Chap-
ter 8 for more on this approach.
CONNECTIONS
Victim Impact Statements Every state jurisdiction allows 
victims to make an impact statement before the sentenc-
ing judge. Victim impact information is part of the Federal 
Crime Act of 1994, in which Congress gave federal victims of 
violent crime or sexual assault the right to speak at sentenc-
ing. Through the Child Protection Act of 1990, child victims 
of federal crimes are allowed to submit victim impact state-
ments that are “commensurate with their age and cognitive 
development,” which can include drawings, models, etc.132
This gives the victim an opportunity to tell of his or her 
experiences and describe the ordeal. In the case of a murder 
trial, the surviving family can recount the effect the crime 
has had on their lives and well-being.133
The effect of victim/witness statements on sentencing has 
been the topic of some debate. Some research fi nds that victim

programs are welcome additions to police services, there is 
little evidence that they appreciably affect the crime rate. 
There is also concern that their effectiveness is spottier in 
low-income, high-crime areas, which need the most crime 
prevention assistance.151 Block watches and neighborhood 
patrols seem more successful when they are part of general-
purpose or multi-issue community groups rather than when 
they focus directly on crime problems.152
Victims’ Rights
More than 30 years ago, legal scholar Frank Carrington sug-
gested that crime victims have legal rights that should assure 
them of basic services from the government.153 According to 
Carrington, just as the defendant has the right to counsel 
and a fair trial, society is also obliged to ensure basic rights 
for law-abiding citizens. These rights range from adequate 
protection from violent crimes to victim compensation and 
assistance from the criminal justice system.
Because of the infl uence of victims’ rights advocates, ev-
ery state now has a set of legal rights for crime victims in its 
code of laws, often called a Victims’ Bill of Rights.154 These 
generally include the right:
To be notifi ed of proceedings and the status of the 
 
■
defendant
To be present at criminal justice proceedings
 
■
To make a statement at sentencing and to receive resti-
 
■
tution from a convicted offender
To be consulted before a case is dismissed or a plea 
 
■
agreement entered
To a speedy trial
 
■
To keep the victim’s contact information confi dential
 
■
Not only has the victims’ rights movement caught on in 
the United States, it has also had an impact in Europe. The 
European Union member nations have agreed in principle to a 
times, victims use guns for defensive purposes, a number 
that is not surprising considering that about one-third of 
U.S. households contain guns.146 Gary Kleck has estimated 
that armed victims kill between 1,500 and 2,800 potential 
felons each year and wound between 8,700 and 16,000. 
Kleck’s research shows, ironically, that by fi ghting back vic-
tims kill far more criminals than the estimated 250 to 1,000 
killed annually by police.147 Kleck has found that the risk of 
collateral injury is relatively rare and that potential victims 
should be encouraged to fight back.148 In a recent study 
conducted with colleague Jongyeon Tark, Kleck reviewed 
more than 27,000 contact crime incidents and found that 
when compared to nonresistance, self-protection signifi-
cantly reduced the likelihood of property loss and injury 
and that the most forceful tactics, including resistance with 
a gun, appear to have the strongest effects in reducing the 
risk of injury. Importantly, the research indicated that resis-
tance did not contribute to injury in any meaningful way. 
The conclusion: it is better to fi ght than fl ee.149
The Thinking Like a Criminologist feature concerns 
 efforts to give victims greater leeway to “fi ght back.”
Community Organization
Not everyone is capable of buying a handgun or semiauto-
matic weapon and doing battle with predatory criminals. An 
alternative approach has been for communities to organize 
on the neighborhood level against crime. Citizens have been 
working independently and in cooperation with local police 
agencies in neighborhood patrol and block watch programs. 
These programs organize local citizens in urban areas to pa-
trol neighborhoods, watch for suspicious people, help se-
cure the neighborhood, lobby for improvements (such as 
increased lighting), report crime to police, put out commu-
nity newsletters, conduct home security surveys, and serve 
as a source for crime information or tips.150 Although such 
The governor’s council is sponsoring an open 
house debate on a proposed “stand your ground 
law.” About 15 states have passed laws that al-
low crime victims to use deadly force in certain 
situations in which they might have formerly been 
charged with a crime, some allowing the use of 
deadly force when a person reasonably believes it 
necessary to prevent the commission of a “forc-
ible felony,” including carjacking, robbery, or as-
sault, and the governor’s council wants to follow 
suit.
The traditional “castle doctrine” required that people could 
only use deadly force in their own home when they reasonably 
believed that their lives were in danger. The new law be-
ing proposed allows the average citizen to use deadly force 
when they reasonably believe that their homes or vehicles 
have been illegally invaded. Furthermore, under the new 
law, a person has no duty to retreat and can meet force with 
force; they are granted immunity from prosecution if they 
can prove they were the target of a crime.

A final, albeit controversial, element of the victims’ 
rights movement is the development of offender registration 
laws that require that the name and sometimes addresses of 
known sex offenders be posted by law enforcement agen-
cies. Today almost every state has adopted sex offender laws 
and the federal government runs a National Sex Offender 
Public Registry with links to every state.156 Sex offender reg-
istration is indelibly linked to the death of Megan Kanka,

crusade to develop laws that require sex 
offenders to register with local police when 
they move into a neighborhood and require 
local authorities to provide community no-
tification of the sex offender’s presence. 
New York State’s Sex Offender Registration 
Act is typical of these efforts, commonly 
known as Megan’s Law. Becoming effec-
tive on January 21, 1996, the statute re-
quires that sex offenders in New York are 
classified by the risk of reoffense. A court 
determines whether an offender is a level 
1 (low risk), 2 (moderate risk), or 3 (high 
risk). The court also determines whether an 
offender should be given the designation of 
a sexual predator, sexually violent offender, 
or predicate sex offender. Offenders are re-
quired to be registered for 20 years or life. 
Level 1 offenders with no designation must 
register for 20 years. Level 1 offenders with 
a designation, as well as level 2 and level 3 
offenders regardless of whether they have a 
designation, must register for life. Local law 
enforcement agencies are notified when-
ever a sex offender moves into their juris-
diction. That agency may notify schools and 
other “entities with vulnerable populations” 
about the presence of a level 2 or level 3 
offender if the offender poses a threat to 
public safety. The act established a toll-free 
telephone information line that citizens can 
call to inquire whether a person is listed in 
the registry and access information on sex 
offenders living in their neighborhoods. 
On the federal level, the Jacob Wetterling 
Crimes Against Children Law, passed in 
May 1996, requires states to pass some 
version of Megan’s Law or lose federal aid. 
At least 47 states plus the District of Colum-
bia have complied. Jesse Timmendequas 
was sentenced to death on June 20, 1997, 
and is currently on death row.
The case of Megan Kanka illustrates both 
the risk children face from sexual predators 
and the efforts being made by the justice 
system to limit that risk. To some civil liberty 
groups, such as the American Civil Liberties 
Union, registration laws go too far because 
they will not prevent sex offenders from 
committing crimes and because they vic-
timize rehabilitated ex-offenders and their 
families. Should the rights of the victim take 
precedent over the privacy of the offender?

Jesse Timmendequas and Megan’s Law
Richard and Maureen Kanka thought that 
their 7-year-old daughter Megan was safe 
in their quiet, suburban neighborhood in 
Hamilton Township, New Jersey. Then, 
on July 29, 1994, their lives were shat-
tered when Megan went missing. Maureen 
Kanka searched the neighborhood and met 
33-year-old Jesse Timmendequas, who 
lived across the street. Timmendequas 
told her that he had seen Megan earlier 
that evening while he was working on his 
car. The police were called in and soon fo-
cused their attention on Timmendequas’s 
house when they learned that he and two 
other residents were convicted sex offend-
ers who had met at a treatment center and 
decided to live together upon their release. 
Timmendequas, who appeared extremely 
nervous when questioned, was asked to ac-
company police back to their headquarters, 
where he confessed to luring Megan into his 
home by inviting her to see a puppy, then 
raping her and strangling her to death.
Timmendequas had served six years 
in prison for aggravated assault and at-
tempted sexual assault on another child. 
The fact that a known sex offender was liv-
ing anonymously in the Kankas’ neighbor-
hood turned Megan’s death into a national

92  PART ONE | CONCEPTS OF CRIME, LAW, AND CRIMINOLOGY
SUMMARY
 1. Describe the victim’s role in the 
crime process
Victims may infl uence criminal 
 
■
behavior by playing an active 
role in a criminal incident. The 
discovery that victims play an 
important role in the crime pro-
cess has prompted the scientifi c 
study of victims, or victimology. 
Criminologists who focus their 
attention on crime victims refer 
to themselves as victimologists.
 2. Know the greatest problems 
faced by crime victims
The costs of victimization can 
 
■
include such things as damaged 
property, pain and suffering to 
victims, and the involvement 
of the police and other agen-
cies of the justice system. The 
pain and suffering infl icted on 
an individual can result in the 
need for medical care, the loss 
of wages from not being able to 
go to work, and reduced quality 
of life from debilitating injuries 
and/or fear of being victim-
ized again, which can result in 
not being able to go to work, 
long-term medical care, and 
counseling.
 3. Know what is meant by the 
term cycle of violence
People who are crime victims 
 
■
may be more likely to commit 
crime themselves. Some may 
seek revenge against the people 
who harmed them. The abuse–
crime phenomenon is referred 
to as the cycle of violence.
 4. Be familiar with the ecology of 
victimization risk
Violent crimes are slightly more 
 
■
likely to take place in an open, 
public area, such as a street, a 
park, or a fi eld. The more seri-
ous violent crimes, such as rape 
and aggravated assault, typically 
take place after 6:00 P.M. Those 
living in the central city have 
signifi cantly higher rates of theft 
and violence than suburbanites; 
people living in rural areas have 
a victimization rate almost half 
that of city dwellers. Schools 
unfortunately are the site of a 
great deal of victimization be-
cause they are populated by one 
of the most dangerous segments 
of society, teenage males.
 5. Describe the victim’s household
The NCVS tells us that within 
 
■
the United States, larger, African 
American, western, and urban 
homes are the most vulnerable 
to crime. In contrast, rural, 
European American homes in 
the Northeast are the least likely 
to contain crime victims or be 
the target of theft offenses, such 
as burglary and larceny. People 
who own their homes are less 
vulnerable than renters.
 6. Describe the most dominant 
victim characteristics
Except for the crimes of rape 
 
■
and sexual assault, males are 
more likely than females to be 
the victims of violent crime. 
Victim data reveal that young 
people face a much greater 
victimization risk than older 
persons. The poorest Ameri-
cans are the most likely to be 
victims of violent and property 
crime. This association occurs 
across all gender, age, and racial 
groups. African Americans are 
about twice as likely as Euro-
pean Americans to be victims 
of violent crime. Never-married 
males and females are victim-
ized more often than married 
people.
 7. Be familiar with the concept of 
 repeat victimization
Individuals who have been 
 
■
crime victims have a signifi -
cantly higher chance of future 
victimization than people who 
have remained nonvictims. 
Households that have expe-
rienced victimization in the 
past are the ones most likely to 
experience it again in the fu-
ture. One reason: some victims’ 
physical weakness or psycho-
logical distress renders them in-
capable of resisting or deterring 
crime and makes them easy 
targets.
 8. Be familiar with the most im-
portant theories of 
victimization
According to victim precipita-
 
■
tion theory, some people may 
actually initiate the confronta-
tion that eventually leads to 
their injury or death. Victim 
precipitation can be either ac-
tive or passive. Some criminolo-
gists believe that people may 
become crime victims because 
their lifestyle increases their 
exposure to criminal offenders. 
People who have high-risk life-
styles—drinking, taking drugs, 
getting involved in crime—have 
a much greater chance of vic-
timization. According to deviant 
place theory, the greater their 
exposure to dangerous places, 
the more likely people are to 
become victims of crime and 
violence. So-called deviant 
places are poor, densely popu-
lated, highly transient neigh-
borhoods in which commercial 
and residential properties exist 
side by side. Routine activities 
theory links victimization to the 
availability of suitable targets, 
the absence of capable guard-
ians, and the presence of moti-
vated offenders.
 9. Discuss programs dedicated to 
caring for the victim
Victim-witness assistance 
 
■
programs are government pro-
grams that help crime victims 
and witnesses; they may in-
clude compensation, court ser-
vices, and/or crisis intervention. 
Such programs often include 
victim compensation—fi nancial 
aid awarded to crime victims to

 1. Considering what we learned in 
this chapter about crime victim-

take to better protect yourself 
from crime?
 2. Do you agree with the assessment 
that schools are some of the most 
dangerous locations in the commu-

to be a dangerous environment?
 3. Does a person bear some of the 
responsibility for his or her vic-

a lifestyle that contributes to the 
chances of becoming a crime 
 victim? In other words, should we 
“blame the victim”?

or counseling. Some programs 
assign counselors to victims 
to serve as advocates to help 
them understand the operation 
of the justice system and guide 
them through the process. Most 
jurisdictions allow victims to 
make an impact statement be-
fore the sentencing judge. Most 
victim programs refer victims 
to specifi c services to help them 
recover from their ordeal.
 10. Be familiar with the concept of 
victims’ rights
Every state now has a set of 
 
■
legal rights for crime victims 
in its code of laws, often called 
a Victims’ Bill of Rights. These 
generally include the victim’s 
right to be notifi ed of pro-
ceedings and the status of the 
defendant, to be present at 
criminal justice proceedings 
and to make statements at tri-
als, to receive restitution from 
a convicted offender, and to 
be consulted about trial proce-
dures, such as when a plea is 
offered.

Theories of Crime 
Causation
An important goal of the criminological enterprise is to create valid and accu-
rate theories of crime causation. A theory can be defi ned as an abstract state-
ment that explains why certain phenomenon or things do (or do not) happen. 
A valid theory must (a) have the ability to be able to predict future occurrences 
or observations of the phenomenon in question and (b) have the ability to be 
validated or tested through experiment or some other form of empirical obser-
vation. So, for example, if a theory states that watching violent TV shows leads 
to aggressive behavior, it can be considered valid only if careful and empirically 
sound tests can prove that kids who watch a lot of violent TV in the present will 
one day become violent in the future. 
Criminologists have sought to collect vital facts about crime and interpret 
them in a scientifi cally meaningful fashion. By developing empirically verifi able 
statements, or hypotheses, and organizing them into theories of crime causa-
tion, they hope to identify the causes of crime. 
Since the late nineteenth century, criminological theory has pointed to various 
underlying causes of crime. The earliest theories generally attributed crime to a 
single underlying cause: atypical body build, genetic abnormality, insanity, physi-
cal anomalies, socialization, or poverty. More recent theoretical efforts are more 
dynamic, incorporating multiple personal and social factors into a complex web 
to explain the onset, continuation, and eventual desistance from a criminal career.
In this section, theories of crime causation are grouped into six chapters. Chapters 4 and 5 
 focus on theories that view crime as based on individual traits. They hold that crime is either a free 
will choice made by an individual, a function of personal psychological or biological abnormality, 
or both. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 investigate theories based in sociology and political economy. These 
theories portray crime as a function of the structure, process, and confl icts of social living. Chap-
ter 9 is devoted to theories that combine or integrate a number of concepts that explain criminal 
behavior over the life course, otherwise known as developmental views of crime.

Just before Christmas in 2004, more than 150,000 fax machines around the country spat out a mysterious 
message, addressed to a “Dr. Mitchel,” that had been written by a fi nancial planner named “Chris.” Though 
it was clearly the wrong number, a lot of people were intrigued because the note was about a hot stock that 
“Chris” wanted the doctor to buy immediately: “I have a stock for you that will triple in price just like the 
last stock I gave you ‘SIRI’ did. I can’t get you on either phone. Either call me, or call Linda to place the new 
trade. We need to buy IFLB now.”
Soon after the mystery fax was sent, shares of IFLB (Infi nium Labs, a video gaming company) started to 
increase, jumping 160 percent in four days and trading at six times its previous volume. Unfortunately for the 
investors who jumped on the tip, there was no “Dr. Mitchel,” no “Chris,” no “Linda,” and no real stock tip.

T
rational decision making to commit their crimes, can we 
also assume that such common crimes as theft, fraud, and 
even murder are a function of detailed planning and deci-
sion making? Before the college students take music off the 
Web, they must fi rst not only acquire expertise and skill, 
but also decide that the money they save is worth the risk of 
detection. But what about the college student who gets into 
a bar fi ght or decides to have sex with an unconscious girl 
at a frat party? Are these crimes calculated and shrewd or 
random and senseless? Some criminologists would answer 
that they believe all criminal behavior, no matter how de-
structive or seemingly irresponsible, is actually a matter of 
thought and decision making. As a group, they are referred 
to as rational choice theorists.
This chapter reviews the philosophical underpinnings of 
rational choice theory, tracing it back to the classical school 
of criminology. We then turn to more recent theoretical 
models that fl ow from the concept of choice. These models 
hold that because criminals are rational, their behavior can 
be controlled or deterred by the fear of punishment; desis-
tance can then be explained by a growing and intense fear 
of criminal sanctions. These views include situational crime 
control, general deterrence theory, specifi c deterrence the-
ory, and incapacitation. Finally, the chapter briefl y reviews 
how choice theory has infl uenced criminal justice policy.
THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF RATIONAL CHOICE
During the early Middle Ages (1200–1400), superstition and 
fear of satanic possession dominated thinking. People who 
violated social norms or religious practices were believed 
to be witches or possessed by demons and not rational 
The “pump and dump” stock market scheme orchestrated by 
Michael Pickens involved knowledge, planning, and ingenu-
ity. Some law violators carefully plan their activities, buy the 
proper equipment, try to avoid detection, and then attempt 
to squirrel away their criminal profi ts in some hidden bank 
account. Their calculated actions suggest that the decision 
to commit crime can involve rational and detailed plan-
ning and decision making, designed to maximize personal 
gain and avoid capture and punishment. Some criminolo-
gists go as far as suggesting that the source of all criminal 
violations—committing a robbery, selling drugs, attacking 
a rival, or fi ling a false tax return—rests upon rational de-
cision making. Such a decision may be based on a variety 
of personal reasons, including greed, revenge, need, anger, 
lust, jealousy, thrill-seeking, or vanity. But the fi nal decision 
to commit a crime is only made after the potential offender 
carefully weighs the potential benefi ts and consequences of 
their planned action and decides that the benefi ts of crime 
are greater than its consequences:
The jealous suitor concludes that the risk of punish-
 
■
ment is worth the satisfaction of punching a rival in 
the nose.
The greedy shopper considers the chance of apprehen-
 
■
sion by store detectives so small that she takes a “fi ve-
fi nger discount” on a new sweater.
The drug dealer concludes that the huge profi t from a 
 
■
single shipment of cocaine far outweighs the possible 
costs of apprehension.
The school yard bully carefully selects his next victim—
 
■
someone who is weak, unpopular, and probably won’t 
fi ght back.
The college student downloads a program that allows 
 
■
her to illegally copy music onto her iPod.
But can all crimes be a function of planning and calcu-
lation? While we can easily assume that international drug 
dealers, white-collar criminals such as Michael Pickens, and 
organized crime figures use planning, organization, and 
It was all part of a scam: the phony fax sender bought shares of Infi nium Labs in advance while prices were 
cheap, blanketed the nation with bogus faxes, and pocketed a tidy profi t after the prices rose when people 
started to buy the shares. It all worked according to plan: in less than two months, the conspiracy resulted in 
a net gain of more than $400,000.
Eventually the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation, tracing the fax calls to a 
Florida company run by Michael Pickens, who in July 2005 was arrested and charged with securities fraud; 
Pickens pleaded guilty and on December 20, 2007, was sentenced to fi ve years of probation and ordered to 
take part in a substance abuse program and pay $1.2 million in restitution. Ironically, Pickens is the son of 
multi-billionaire oil investor T. Boone Pickens, one of the nation’s richest men.1

CHAPTER 4 | Rational Choice Theory  103
would-be law violators could be convinced that the pain 
of punishment exceeds the benefi ts of crime.4 The purpose 
of law is to produce and support the total happiness of the 
community it serves. Because punishment is in itself harm-
ful, its existence is justifi ed only if it promises to prevent 
greater evil than it creates. Punishment, therefore, has four 
main objectives:
 1. To prevent all criminal offenses
 2. When it cannot prevent a crime, to convince the offender 
to commit a less serious crime
 3. To ensure that a criminal uses no more force than is 
necessary
 4. To prevent crime as cheaply as possible5
Cesare Beccaria 
The development of rational classical criminology is most 
closely identifi ed with the thoughts of Italian social philoso-
pher Cesare Beccaria (1738–1794), and his famous treatise, 
“On Crimes and Punishment” in which he called for fair and 
certain punishment to deter crime. He believed people are 
egotistical and self-centered, and therefore they must be mo-
tivated by the fear of punishment, which provides a tangible 
motive for them to obey the law and suppress the “despotic 
spirit” that resides in every person.6 Beccaria suggested that 
(a) people choose all behavior, including criminal behavior; 
(b) their choices are designed to bring them pleasure and 
reduce pain; (c) criminal choices can be controlled by fear 
of punishment; and (d) the more severe, certain, and swift 
the punishment, the greater its ability to control criminal 
behavior.
While necessary, Beccaria also believed that punish-
ment must be proportional to the seriousness of crime; if 
not, people would be encouraged to commit more serious 
offenses. For example, if robbery, rape, and murder were all 
punished by death, robbers or rapists would have little rea-
son to refrain from killing their victims to eliminate them as 
witnesses to the crime. Today, this is referred to as the con-
cept of marginal deterrence—if petty offenses were subject 
to the same punishment as more serious crimes, offenders 
would choose the more serious crime because the resulting 
punishment would be about the same.7
Beccaria also suggested that the extremely harsh pun-
ishments of the day and routine use of torture were in-
appropriate and excessive. To deter crime, the pain of 
punishment must be administered in a fair, balanced, and 
proportionate amount, just enough to counterbalance the 
pleasure obtained from crime. Beccaria stated his famous 
theorem like this:
In order for punishment not to be in every instance, an 
act of violence of one or many against a private citizen, 
it must be essentially public, prompt, necessary, the 
least possible in the given circumstances, proportionate 
to the crimes, and dictated by the laws.8
decision makers. St. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) argued 
that there was a God-given “natural law” that was based on 
people’s natural tendency to do good. People who were evil 
were manifesting original sin and a fall from grace, similar 
to that experienced by Adam and Eve when they were ex-
pelled from the Garden of Eden.
The prescribed method for dealing with the possessed 
was burning at the stake, a practice that survived into the 
seventeenth century. Beginning in the mid-thirteenth cen-
tury, the jurisdiction of central governments reached a signif-
icantly broader range of social behaviors. Human problems 
and confl icts began to be dealt with in a formalized and legal 
manner.2 Nonetheless, superstition and harsh punishments 
did not end quickly. The authorities were on guard against 
Satan’s offspring, who engaged in acts ranging from witch-
craft to robbery. Between 1581 and 1590, Nicholas Remy, 
head of the Inquisition in the French province of Lorraine, 
ordered 900 sorcerers and witches burned to death; like-
wise, Peter Binsfi eld, the bishop of the German city of Trier, 
ordered the death of 6,500 people. An estimated 100,000 
people were prosecuted throughout Europe for witchcraft 
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It was also 
commonly believed that some families produced offspring 
who were unsound or unstable and that social misfi ts were 
inherently damaged by reason of their “inferior blood.”3 It 
was common practice to use cruel tortures to extract confes-
sions, and those convicted of violent or theft crimes suffered 
extremely harsh penalties, including whipping, branding, 
maiming, and execution. Almost all felons were punished 
with death; the law made little distinction between thieves 
and murderers.
This rather fantastical vision of deviant behavior and 
its control began to wane as new insights were developed 
about human nature and behavior during the Renaissance. 
One influential authority, philosopher Thomas Hobbes 
(1588–1678), suggested the existence of a “social contract” 
between people and the state: people naturally pursue their 
own self-interests but are rational enough to realize that self-
ishness will produce social chaos, so they agree to give up 
their own selfi sh interests as long as everyone else does the 
same thing. Not all agree to the social contract, and there-
fore the state became empowered with the right to use force 
to maintain the contract.
Development of Classical Criminology 
During the eighteenth century Enlightenment period, so-
cial philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham (1748–1833) be-
gan to embrace the view that human behavior was a result 
of rational thought processes.
According to Bentham’s “utilitarian calculus,” people 
choose to act when, after weighing costs and benefi ts, they 
believe that their actions will bring them an increase in 
pleasure and a reduction of pain. It stands to reason that 
criminal behavior could be eliminated or controlled if

easily manipulated, the concept of punishing people for be-
haviors beyond their control seemed both foolish and cruel. 
Although classical principles still controlled the way police, 
courts, and correctional agencies operated, most criminolo-
gists rejected classical criminology as an explanation of 
criminal behavior.
Contemporary Choice Theory Emerges
Beginning in the mid-1970s, there was renewed interest in 
the classical approach to crime. First, the rehabilitation of 
known criminals came under attack. According to liberal 
criminology, if crime was caused by some social or psycho-
logical problem, such as poverty, then crime rates could be 
reduced by providing good jobs and economic opportuni-
ties. Despite some notable efforts to provide such opportu-
nities, a number of national surveys (the best known being 
Robert Martinson’s “What Works?”) failed to fi nd examples 
of rehabilitation programs that prevented future crimi-
nal activity.10 A well-publicized book, Beyond Probation, by 
Charles Murray and Louis Cox, went as far as suggesting 
that punishment-oriented programs could suppress future 
criminality much more effectively than those that relied on 
rehabilitation and treatment efforts.11
A signifi cant increase in the reported crime rate, as well 
as serious disturbances in the nation’s prisons, frightened 
the general public. The media depicted criminals as cal-
lous and dangerous rather than as needy people deserving 
of public sympathy. Some criminologists began to suggest 
that it made more sense to frighten these cold calculators 
with severe punishments than to waste public funds by fu-
tilely trying to improve entrenched social conditions linked 
to crime, such as poverty.12
Thinking About Crime Beginning in the late 1970s, a 
number of criminologists began producing books and mono-
graphs expounding the theme that criminals are rational ac-
tors who plan their crimes, fear punishment, and deserve to 
be penalized for their misdeeds. In a 1975 book that came 
to symbolize renewed interest in classical views, Thinking 
about Crime, political scientist James Q. Wilson debunked 
the view that crime was a function of external forces, such 
as poverty, that could be altered by government programs. 
Instead, he argued, efforts should be made to reduce crimi-
nal opportunity by deterring would-be offenders and incar-
cerating known criminals. People who are likely to commit 
crime, he maintained, lack inhibition against misconduct, 
value the excitement and thrills of breaking the law, have 
a low stake in conformity, and are willing to take greater 
chances than the average person. If they could be convinced 
that their actions will bring severe punishment, only the to-
tally irrational would be willing to engage in crime.13 Wilson 
made this famous observation:
Wicked people exist. Nothing avails except to set them 
apart from innocent people. And many people, neither 
Classical Criminology
The writings of Beccaria and his followers form the core of 
what today is referred to as classical criminology. As origi-
nally conceived in the eighteenth century, classical criminol-
ogy theory had several basic elements:
In every society, people have free will to choose crimi-
 
■
nal or lawful solutions to meet their needs or settle their 
problems.
Criminal solutions can be very attractive because for 
 
■
little effort they hold the promise of a huge payoff.
A person will choose not to commit crime only if he or 
 
■
she believes that the pain of expected punishment is 
greater than the promise of reward. This is the principle 
of deterrence.
In order to be an effective crime deterrent, punishment 
 
■
must be severe, certain, and swift enough to convince 
potential criminals that “crime does not pay.”
This classical perspective influenced penal practices for 
more than 200 years. The law was made proportionate 
to crime so that the most serious offenses earned the 
harshest punishments. Executions were still widely used 
but slowly began to be employed for only the most seri-
ous crimes. The catchphrase was “let the punishment fit 
the crime.”
Beccaria’s ideas and writings inspired social thinkers 
to believe that criminals choose to commit crime and that 
crime can be controlled by judicious punishment. His vi-
sion was widely accepted throughout Europe and the United 
States.9
This vision was embraced by France’s postrevolutionary 
Constituent Assembly (1789) in its Declaration of the Rights 
of Man:
[T]he law has the right to prohibit only actions harmful 
to society. . . . The law shall infl ict only such punish-
ments as are strictly and clearly necessary . . . no person 
shall be punished except by virtue of a law enacted and 
promulgated previous to the crime and applicable to 
its terms.
Similarly, a prohibition against cruel and unusual pun-
ishment was incorporated in the Eighth Amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution.
Beccaria’s writings have been credited as the basis of the 
elimination of torture and severe punishment in the nine-
teenth century. The practice of incarcerating criminals and 
structuring prison sentences to fi t the severity of crime was 
a refl ection of his classical criminology.
By the end of the nineteenth century, the popularity of 
the classical approach began to decline, and by the middle 
of the twentieth century, this perspective was neglected by 
mainstream criminologists. During this period, criminolo-
gists focused on internal and external factors—poverty, IQ, 
education, home life—which were believed to be the true 
causes of criminality. Because these conditions could not be

minority men being locked up for drug law violations.15 
 Today, about 65 percent of the prison population is Afri-
can American or Hispanic.16 Despite liberal anguish, con-
servative views of crime control have helped shape criminal 
justice policy for the past two decades.17 Many Americans, 
some of whom are passionate opponents of abortion on the 
grounds that it takes human life, became, ironically, ardent 
supporters of the death penalty!18 This “get tough” attitude 
was supported by the fact that while the prison population 
has grown to new heights, the crime rate has been in a steep 
decline.
Even if the death penalty were an effective deterrent, 
some critics believe it presents ethical problems that 
make its use morally dubious. For more information about 
what the American Civil Liberties Union has to say, visit the 
Criminal Justice CourseMate at cengagebrain.com, then 
access the “Web Links” for this chapter. 
From these roots, a more contemporary version of clas-
sical theory has evolved. It is based on intelligent thought 
processes and criminal decision making.19 This new view 
of rational choice is somewhat different from the origi-
nal classical theory that portrayed criminals as people 
who tried to maximize their pleasure and minimize pain. 
If they were caught committing crime it was because they 
were sloppy thinkers and imperfect in their decision mak-
ing. In contrast, this contemporary version views the deci-
sion to commit crime as being shaped by human emotions 
and thought processes. It recognizes that other infl uences 
have an impact on criminal decision making, including so-
cial relationships, individual traits and capabilities, and en-
vironmental characteristics. So, this new version of rational 
choice theory assumes that human behavior is both “willful 
and determined.”20
THE CONCEPTS OF 
RATIONAL CHOICE
According to the contemporary rational choice approach, 
law-violating behavior occurs when an offender decides to 
risk breaking the law after considering both personal fac-
tors (i.e., the need for money, revenge, thrills, and enter-
tainment) and situational factors (i.e., how well a target 
is protected and the efficiency of the local police force). 
People who believe that the risks of crime outweigh the 
rewards may decide to go straight. If they think they are 
likely to be arrested and punished, they are more likely to 
seek treatment and turn their lives around than risk crimi-
nal activities.21
wicked nor innocent, but watchful, dissembling, and 
calculating of their chances, ponder our reaction to 
wickedness as a clue to what they might profi tably do.14
Here Wilson is saying that unless we react forcefully to 
crime, those “sitting on the fence” will get a clear message—
crime pays.

Nations,” the 1997 Francis Boyer lecture delivered

The Seductions of Crime Another infl uential work was 
sociologist Jack Katz’s Seductions of Crime. Katz argues that 
there are immediate benefits to criminality. These seduc-
tions of crime are situational inducements that directly pre-
cede the commission of a crime and draw offenders into law 
violations. For example, someone challenges their authority 
and they vanquish their opponent with a beating; or they 
want to do something exciting, so they break into and van-
dalize a school building.
According to Katz, choosing crime can help satisfy per-
sonal needs. For some people, shoplifting and vandalism 
are attractive because getting away with crime is a thrill-
ing demonstration of personal competence; Katz calls this 
“sneaky thrills.” Even murder can have an emotional payoff. 
Killers behave like the avenging gods of mythology, choos-
ing to have life-or-death control over their victims.
Katz fi nds that crimes can help soothe the strain pro-
duced by emotional upheaval. For example, when a person 
is rebuked for his or her behavior, violence may be a method 
for restoring the person’s self-esteem. When a person gets 
drunk and rowdy at a party and is told by a rival to tone it 
down, the aggrieved person may respond, “So, I’m acting 
like a fool, am I?” and attack. Public embarrassment leads to 
action; the person must “sacrifi ce” or injure the body of the 
victim to maintain his or her “honor.” A number of research 
studies have supported Katz’s view that situational induce-
ments play an important role in causing adolescent misbe-
havior. People are most likely to be “seduced” if they fear 
neither the risk of apprehension nor its social consequences. 
People who either (a) fear losing the respect of their peers or 
(b) suffer legal punishment are most likely to forgo the se-
ductions of crime.
Impact on Crime Control Coinciding with the publica-
tion of Wilson’s book was a conservative shift in U.S. pub-
lic policy, which resulted in Ronald Reagan’s election to the 
presidency in 1980. Political decision makers embraced Wil-
son’s ideas as a means to bring the crime rate down. Tough 
new laws were passed, creating mandatory prison sentences 
for drug offenders; the nation’s prison population skyrock-
eted. Critics decried the disproportionate number of young

106  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Choosing Crime
Even those who decide to enter a criminal way of life do not 
commit crime all the time. People who commit crime go 
to school, church, or work, they have family time, engage 
in romances, play sports, and go to movies. Why do they 
choose to commit a particular crime at a particular time?
Before choosing to commit a crime, reasoning crimi-
nals evaluate the risk of apprehension, the seriousness of 
expected punishment, the potential value of the criminal 
enterprise, and their immediate need for criminal gain; 
their behavior is systematic and selective. For example, 
burglars choose targets based on their value, novelty, and 
resale potential. A relatively new piece of electronic gear 
such as the newest iPhone or iPad may be a prime target, 
because it has not yet saturated the market and still retains 
high value.28
Risk evaluations may cover a wide range of topics: 
What’s the chance of getting caught? How diffi cult will it be 
to commit the crime? Is the profi t worth the effort? Should 
I risk committing crime in my own neighborhood where I 
know the territory, or is it worth traveling to a strange place 
in order to increase my profi ts?29
People who decide to get involved in crime weigh up 
the chances of arrest (based on their past experiences), plus 
the subjective psychic rewards of crime including the ex-
citement and social status it brings and perceived opportu-
nities for easy gains. If the rewards are great, the perceived 
risk small, and the excitement high, the likelihood of com-
mitting additional crimes increases.30 Successful thieves say 
they will do it again in the future; past experience has taught 
them the rewards of illegal behavior.31
Criminals, then, are people who share the same ambi-
tions as conventional citizens but have decided to cut cor-
ners and use illegal means to achieve their goals (see the 
Profiles in Crime feature “Looting the Public Treasury”). 
Many criminal offenders retain conventional American val-
ues of striving for success, material attainment, and hard 
work.32 When Philippe Bourgois studied crack dealers in 
East Harlem in New York City, he found that their motiva-
tions were not dissimilar from the average citizen: they were 
upwardly mobile, scrambling around to obtain their “piece 
of the pie.”33 If they commit crime, it is because they have 
chosen an illegal path to obtain the goals that might other-
wise have been out of reach.
In contrast, the decision to forgo crime is reached when 
the potential criminal believes that risks outweigh rewards. 
People will forgo crime if after a careful evaluation of the 
circumstances they conclude that:
They stand a good chance of being caught and punished.
 
■
They fear the consequences of punishment.
 
■
They risk losing the respect of their peers, damaging their 
 
■
reputations, and experiencing feelings of guilt or shame.34
The risk of apprehension outweighs the profi t and/or 
 
■
pleasure of crime.35
Why Crime?
The core premise of rational choice theory is that some 
people choose crime under some circumstances. Why is 
that so when the consequences can be painful, costly, and 
embarrassing? Nonetheless, for some people choosing 
crime is actually an easy decision to make. Take adoles-
cents, who regularly violate the law. The criminal lifestyle 
fi ts well with this group, whose membership routinely or-
ganize their life around risk taking and partying. Crimi-
nal events provide money for drugs and serve as an ideal 
method for displaying courage and fearlessness to one’s 
running mates. Rather than create overwhelming social 
problems, a criminal way of life can be extremely benefi -
cial, helping kids overcome the problems and stress they 
face in their daily lives.
Crime helps some people achieve a sense of control 
or mastery over their environment.22 Adolescents in par-
ticular may fi nd themselves feeling out of control because 
society limits their opportunities and resources. Antiso-
cial behavior gives them the opportunity to exert control 
over their own lives and destinies, by helping them avoid 
situations they fi nd uncomfortable or repellant (e.g., run-
ning away from an abusive home) or obtain resources for 
desired activities and commodities (e.g., stealing or sell-
ing drugs to buy stylish outfi ts).23 Crime may also help 
them boost their self-esteem by attacking perceived en-
emies (e.g., they vandalize the property of an adult who 
has called the cops on them). Drinking and drug taking 
may help some kids ward off depression and compensate 
for a lack of positive experiences; they learn how to self-
medicate themselves. Some, angry at their mistreatment, 
may turn to violence to satisfy a desire for revenge or 
retaliation.24
Engaging in risky behavior helps some people feel alive 
and competent. Some turn to substance abuse to increase 
their sense of personal power, to become more assertive, 
and reduce tension and anxiety.25 Others embrace a deviant 
lifestyle to compensate for their feelings of powerlessness 
or ordinariness. There is also evidence that antisocial acts 
can provide positive solutions to problems. Violent kids, for 
example, may have learned that being aggressive with oth-
ers is a good means to control the situation and get what 
they want; counterattacks may be one means of controlling 
people who are treating them poorly.26
Considering its benefits, why do people age out of 
crime? While crime as a short-run problem-solving so-
lution may be appealing to adolescents, it becomes less 
attractive as people mature and begin to appreciate the 
dangers of using crime to solve problems.27 Going to a 
drunken frat party may sound appealing to sophomores 
who want to improve their social life, but the risks in-
volved to safety and reputation make them off limits as 
they grow older. As people mature, their thinking extends 
farther into the future, and risky behavior is a threat to 
long-range plans.

Lack of conventional opportunity is a persistent theme 
in sociological theories of crime. The frustration caused 
by a perceived lack of opportunity explains the high 
crime rates in lower-class areas. Chapter 6 discusses 
strain and cultural deviance theories, which provide 
alternative explanations of how lack of opportunity is 
associated with crime.
CONNECTIONS
Offense and Offender
Rational choice theorists view crime as both offense- and 
offender-specifi c.36 That a crime is offense-specifi c means 
that offenders will react selectively to the characteristics of 
with the public’s cash. In one such scheme, 
Robles coerced businesses to hire a financial 
consultant named Edward Espinoza in order 
to win various city contracts, including senior 
housing and sewer rehabilitation projects. As 
part of this plan, Robles and Espinoza set up 
a shell corporation that raked in some $2.4 
million—more than $1.4 million of which 
went straight into Robles’s pockets. He used 
part of the money to buy a $165,000 beach 
condo in Baja for his mother; he also forked 
over $55,000 for “platinum membership” 
in a motivational group. In another scheme, 
Robles steered a $48 million refuse and re-
cycling contract to a company in exchange 
for more than $30,000 in gifts and campaign 
contributions.
In February 2003, Robles was targeted 
by a federal grand jury looking into the han-
dling of federal loans and grants. FBI and 
IRS investigators pored over city records to 
uncover his illegal schemes. The citizens 
of South Gate ultimately voted Robles and 
his cronies out of office (but not before he 
racked up huge legal bills at the city’s ex-
pense), and he was convicted at trial in July 
2005. Two of his business associates— 
including Espinoza—also went to prison.
Robles’s illegal acts were the product 
of careful plotting and planning. They were 
motivated by greed and not need. To some 
criminologists, stories like these confirm the 
fact that many crimes are a matter of ratio-
nal choice.

Looting the Public Treasury
After graduating from UCLA, Albert Robles 
served terms as mayor, councilman, and 
deputy city manager of South Gate, Cali-
fornia, an industrial community about 12 
miles outside downtown Los Angeles. Soon 
after Robles became city treasurer in 1997, 
he plotted to rule the city purely for his own 
benefit. He even proclaimed himself “King 
of South Gate” and referred to the city as 
his “fiefdom.” Once in power, Robles got 
involved in a number of convoluted illegal 
schemes, including:
Using the city’s treasury as his “private

his friends” (according to acting U.S. 
Attorney George Cardona), costing South

it to the verge of bankruptcy

Note the distinction made here between crime and 
criminality.37 Crime is an event; criminality is a personal 
trait. Professional criminals do not commit crime all the 
time, and even ordinary citizens may, on occasion, violate 
the law. Some people considered high risk because they are 
indigent or disturbed may never violate the law, whereas 
others who are seemingly affl uent and well adjusted may 
risk criminal behavior given enough provocation and/or 
opportunity. What conditions promote crime and enhance 
criminality?
Structuring Criminality
A number of personal factors condition people to choose 
crime. Among the more important factors are economic op-
portunity, learning and experience, and knowledge of crimi-
nal techniques.
Economic Opportunity Boston Magazine ran an article 
recently about a university lecturer with a master’s degree 
from Yale and a doctorate in cultural anthropology who 
took another job to pay the bills: call girl.38 Rather than liv-
ing on the meager teaching salary she was offered, the “Ivy 
League hooker” chose to make the tax-free $140 per hour 
for her services (she charged $200, handing over $60 to the 
escort service that arranged her dates). She left the business 
when she became fi nancially self-suffi cient.
The Ivy League hooker is not alone. Perceptions of eco-
nomic opportunity infl uence the decision to commit crime. 
Some people may engage in criminal activity simply because 
they need the money to support their lifestyle and perceive 
few other potential income sources. Sociologists Christopher 
Uggen and Melissa Thompson found that people who begin 
taking hard drugs also increase their involvement in crime, 
taking in from $500 to $700 per month. Once they become 
cocaine and heroin users, the benefi ts of other criminal en-
terprises become overwhelmingly attractive: how else can a 
drug user earn enough to support his or her habit?39
Crime also becomes attractive when an individual be-
comes convinced that it will result in excessive profi ts with 
few costs. Research shows that criminals may be motivated 
to commit crime when they know others who have made 
big scores and are quite successful at crime. Although the 
prevailing wisdom is that crime does not pay, a small but 
signifi cant subset of criminals actually enjoy earnings of 
close to $50,000 per year from crime, and their success 
may help motivate other would-be offenders.40 However, 
offenders are likely to desist from crime if they believe that 
their future criminal earnings will be relatively low and 
that attractive and legal opportunities to generate income 
have the prerequisites to commit a successful criminal act. 
These might include evaluation of:
Whether they possess the necessary skills to commit 
 
■
the crime
Their immediate need for money or other valuables
 
■
Whether legitimate fi nancial alternatives to crime exist, 
 
■
such as a high-paying job
Whether they have available resources to commit 
 
■
the crime
Some people commit crime simply for economic reasons: it is 
convenient and easy to make financial gain through illegal activity. 
Dr. Brooke Magnanti, shown here, is a research scientist, blogger, and 
writer who, until her identity was revealed in November 2009, was 
known by the pen name Belle de Jour. While completing her doctoral 
studies in England, between 2003 and 2004, Magnanti supported 
her income by working as a prostitute. Her diary, published as the 
anonymous blog Belle de Jour: Diary of a London Call Girl, became 
increasingly popular as speculation surrounded the identity of Belle 
de Jour and whether the diary was even real. Remaining anonymous, 
Magnanti went on to have her experiences published in 2005 in The 
Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl and in a 2006 follow-up, 
The Further Adventures of a London Call Girl. In 2007, Belle’s blogs and 
books were adapted into a television series, Secret Diary of a Call Girl. 
Having written as a newspaper columnist, Belle also moved into fiction 
publishing. In November 2009, reportedly fearing an ex-boyfriend was 
about to expose her real identity, Magnanti revealed to a newspaper 
her real name and current occupation as a researcher in child health 
at Bristol University. Why do you think highly educated women such as 
Brooke Magnanti get into prostitution? Is it solely for the money?

that they are not forced to carry large amounts of product 
on their persons. Dealers carefully evaluate the security of 
their sales area before setting up shop.46 Most consider the 
middle of a long block the best place for drug deals because 
they can see everything in both directions; police raids can 
be spotted before they develop.47 If a buyer seems danger-
ous or unreliable, the dealer would require that they do 
business in spaces between apartment buildings or in back 
lots. Although dealers lose the tactical edge of being on a 
public street, they gain a measure of protection because 
their associates can watch over the deal and come to the 
rescue if the buyer tries to “pull something.”48 Similar de-
tection avoidance schemes were found by Gordon Knowles 
in his study of crack dealers in Honolulu, Hawaii. Knowles 
found that drug dealers often use pornographic fi lm houses 
as their base of operations because they offer both privacy 
and convenience.49
When Jacobs, along with Jody Miller, studied female 
crack dealers, they discovered a variety of defensive moves 
used by the dealers to avoid detection.50 One of these tech-
niques, called stashing, involved learning how to hide drugs 
on their person, in the street, or at home. One dealer told 
Jacobs and Miller how she hid drugs in the empty shaft of a 
curtain rod; another wore hollow earmuffs to hide crack. Be-
cause only female offi cers may conduct body cavity searches 
on women, the dealers often had time to get rid of their 
drugs before they got to the station house. Dealers are aware 
of legal defi nitions of possession. One said she stashed her 
drugs 250 feet from her home because that was beyond the 
distance (150 feet) police considered a person legally to be 
in “constructive possession” of drugs.
Criminals who learn the proper techniques may be able 
to prolong their criminal careers. Jacobs found that these of-
fenders use specifi c techniques to avoid being apprehended 
by police. They play what they call the “peep game” before 
dealing drugs, scoping out the territory to make sure the 
turf is free from anything out of place that could be a poten-
tial threat (such as police offi cers or rival gang members).51
One crack dealer told Jacobs:
There was this red Pontiac sittin’ on the corner one day 
with two white guys inside. They was just sittin’ there 
for an hour, not doin’ nothin’. Another day, diff’rent 
people be walkin’ up and down the street you don’t re-
ally recognize. You think they might be kin of someone 
but then you be askin’ around and they [neighbors] 
ain’t never seen them before neither. When ya’ see 
strange things like that, you think somethin’ be goin’ 
on [and you don’t deal].52
Drug dealers told Jacobs that they also carefully consider 
whether they should deal alone or in groups; large groups 
draw more attention from police but can offer more pro-
tection. Drug-dealing gangs and groups can help divert the 
attention of police: if their drug dealing is noticed by detec-
tives, a dealer can slyly walk away or dispose of evidence 
while confederates distract the cops.53
are available.41 In this sense, rational choice is a function 
of a person’s perception of conventional alternatives and 
opportunities.
The role of economic needs in the motivation of white-
collar criminals is discussed in Chapter 13. Research 
shows that even consistently law-abiding people may 
turn to criminal solutions when faced with overwhelm-
ing economic needs. They make the rational decision to 
commit crimes to solve some economic crisis.
CONNECTIONS
Learning and Experience Learning and experience may 
be important elements in structuring the choice of crime.42
Career criminals may learn the limitations of their powers; 
they know when to take a chance and when to be cautious. 
Experienced criminals may turn from a life of crime when 
they develop a belief that the risk of crime is greater than 
its potential profi t.43 Patricia Morgan and Karen Ann Joe’s 
three-city study (San Francisco, San Diego, and Honolulu) 
of female drug abusers found that experience helped deal-
ers avoid detection. One dealer, earning $50,000 per year, 
explained her strategy this way:
I stayed within my goals, basically . . . I don’t go around 
doing stupid things. I don’t walk around telling people 
I have drugs for sale. I don’t have people sitting out in 
front of my house. I don’t have traffi c in and out of my 
house . . . I control the people I sell to.44
Morgan and Joe found that these female dealers con-
sider drug distribution a positive experience that gives 
them economic independence, self-esteem, increased abil-
ity to function, professional pride, and the ability to main-
tain control over their lives. These women often seemed 
more like yuppies opening a boutique than out-of-control 
addicts:
I’m a good dealer. I don’t cut my drugs, I have high-
quality drugs insofar as it’s possible to get high-quality 
drugs. I want to be known as somebody who sells good 
drugs, but doesn’t always have them, as opposed to 
someone who always has them and sometimes the 
drugs are good.45
Here we see how experience in the profession shapes crimi-
nal decision making.
Knowledge of Criminal Techniques Criminals report 
learning techniques that help them avoid detection, a sure 
sign of rational thinking and planning. Some are special-
ists, who learn to be professional car thieves or bad-check 
artists. Others are generalists who sell drugs one day and 
commit burglaries the next. In his studies of drug dealers, 
criminologist Bruce Jacobs found that crack dealers learn 
how to stash crack cocaine in some undisclosed location so

they are unlikely to travel long distances to commit crimes 
and are more likely to drift toward the center of a city than 
move toward outlying areas.58 Some may occasionally com-
mute to distant locations to commit crimes if they believe 
the payoff is greater, but most prefer to stay in their own 
neighborhood where they are familiar with the terrain.59
They will only travel to unfamiliar areas if they believe the 
new location contains a worthy target and lax law enforce-
ment. They may be encouraged to travel when the police 
are cracking down in their own neighborhood and the 
“heat is on.”60 Predatory criminals are in fact aware of law 
enforcement capabilities and consider them closely before 
deciding to commit crimes. Communities with the repu-
tation of employing aggressive crime-fi ghting cops are less 
likely to attract potential offenders than areas perceived to 
have passive law enforcers.61
Selecting the Target of Crime Criminals may also be 
well aware of target vulnerability. When they choose tar-
gets, they may shy off if they sense danger. In a series of 
interviews with career property offenders, Kenneth Tunnell 
found that burglars avoid targets if they feel there are po-
lice in the area or if “nosy neighbors” might be suspicious 
and cause trouble.62 Paul Bellair found that robbery levels 
are relatively low in neighborhoods where residents keep a 
watchful eye on their neighbors’ property.63
Predatory criminals seek out easy targets who can’t or 
won’t fi ght back and avoid those who seem menacing and 
dangerous. Not surprisingly, they tend to shy away from 
potential victims whom they believe are armed and dan-
gerous.64 The search for suitable victims may bring them 
in contact with people who themselves engage in deviant 
or antisocial behaviors.65 Perhaps predatory criminals sense 
that people with “dirty hands” make suitable targets because 
they are unlikely to want to call the police or get entangled 
with the law.
In some instances, however, targets are chosen in or-
der to send a message rather than to generate capital. Bruce 
Jacobs and Richard Wright used in-depth interviews with 
street robbers who target drug dealers and found that their 
crimes are a response to one of three types of violations.66
Market-related
 
■
 violations emerge from disputes involv-
ing partners in trade, rivals, or generalized predators.
Status-based
 
■
 violations involve encounters in which the 
grievant’s essential character or normative sensibilities 
have been challenged.
Personalistic
 
■
 violations fl ow from incidents in which the 
grievant’s autonomy or belief in a just world have been 
jeopardized.
Robbery in this instance is an instrument used to settle 
scores, display dominance, and stifl e potential rivals. Retali-
ation certainly is rational in the sense that actors who lack 
legitimate access to the law and who prize respect above ev-
erything else will often choose to resolve their grievances 
through a rough and ready brand of self-help.
Rational choice theory dovetails with routine activi-
ties theory, which you learned about in Chapter 3. Al-
though not identical, these approaches both claim that 
crime rates are a normal product of criminal opportu-
nity. Both suggest that criminals consider such elements 
as guardianship and target attractiveness before they 
decide to commit crimes. The routine activities and ra-
tional choice views also agree that criminal opportunity 
is a key element in the criminal process. The overlap 
between these two viewpoints may help criminologists 
suggest means for effective crime control.
CONNECTIONS
Structuring Crime
Criminal decision making is not only based on an assess-
ment of personal needs and capabilities, but also on a ra-
tional assessment of the criminal event. Decisions must be 
made about what, where, when, and whom to target:
Choosing the Type of Crime The choice of crime may be 
dictated by market conditions. Generalists may alter their 
criminal behavior according to shifting opportunity struc-
tures: they may rob the elderly on the first of the month 
when they know that Social Security checks have been 
cashed, switch over to shoplifting if a new fence moves into 
the neighborhood, and, if a supply becomes available, sell 
a truckload of hijacked cigarettes to neighborhood conve-
nience stores.
Sometimes the choice of crime is structured by the situ-
ational factors. Eric Baumer and his associates found that 
cities whose population of crack cocaine users is on the 
increase also experience an increase in their robbery rates 
and a corresponding decrease in burglary rates. Baumer 
reasons that crack users need a quick infl ux of cash to pur-
chase drugs and are in no position to plan a burglary and 
take the time to sell their loot; street robberies are designed 
to provide a quick infl ux of cash that meets their lifestyle 
needs.54
Choosing the Time and Place of Crime There is also 
evidence that criminal choice is structured by the time and 
place. Interviews with burglars show that they prefer “work-
ing” between 9 A.M. and 11 A.M. and in mid-afternoon, when 
parents are either at work or dropping off or picking up kids 
at school.55 Burglars avoid Saturdays because most families 
are at home; Sunday morning during church hours is con-
sidered a prime time for weekend burglaries.56 Some fi nd 
out which families have star high school athletes because 
those that do are sure to be at the weekend game, leaving 
their houses unguarded.57
The place of crime is also carefully chosen. Because 
criminals often go on foot or use public transportation,

surrounded by wooded areas, make suitable targets.73 Pro-
fessionals also report being concerned about target conve-
nience. They are more apt to choose familiar burglary sites 
that are located in easily accessible and open areas.74
Burglars are choosy when they select targets. They avoid 
freestanding buildings because they can more easily be sur-
rounded by police; they like to select targets that are known 
to do a primarily cash business, such as bars, supermarkets, 
and restaurants.75 Burglars also seem to know the market 
and target goods that are in demand. Police in England re-
port that carefully planned burglaries seem to be on the de-
cline, presumably because goods that were the target a few 
years back—such as video recorders and DVD players—are 
now so cheap that they are not worth stealing; in English 
terms, they are barely worth “nicking.” Flat-screen TVs may 
be valuable, but those that are the most valuable have be-
come so large that they are impractical to steal.76 As a result, 
the planned professional burglary is on a decline in Britain 
at the same time that street muggings are on the rise.
Is Drug Use Rational?
Did Lindsay Lohan make an objective, rational choice to 
abuse alcohol and potentially sabotage her career? Did the ter-
rifi c young actor Heath Ledger make a rational choice when 
he abused prescription drugs to the point that it killed him? 
Is it possible that drug users and dealers, a group not usually 
associated with clear thinking, make rational choices?
Research does in fact show that from its onset drug use 
is controlled by rational decision making. Users report that 
they begin taking drugs when they believe that the bene-
fi ts of substance abuse outweigh its costs (e.g., they believe 
that drugs will provide a fun, exciting, thrilling experience). 
Their entry into substance abuse is facilitated by their per-
ception that valued friends and family members endorse 
and encourage drug use and abuse substances themselves.77
In adulthood, heavy drug users and dealers show signs 
of rationality and cunning in their daily activity, approaching 
drug dealing as a business proposition. Research conducted 
by Leanne Fiftal Alarid and her partners shows that women 
drawn into dealing drugs learn the trade in a businesslike 
manner. One young dealer told them how she learned the 
techniques of the trade from an older male partner:
He taught me how to “recon” [reconstitute] cocaine, 
cutting and repacking a brick from 91 proof to 50 
proof, just like a business. He treats me like an equal 
partner, and many of the friends are business associates. 
I am a catalyst. . . . I even get guys turned on to drugs.78
Note the business terminology used. This coke dealer could be 
talking about an IT training course at a major corporation! If 
criminal acts are treated as business decisions, in which profi t 
and loss potential must be carefully calculated, then crime 
must indeed be a rational event. The Criminological Enter-
prise feature discusses the rational aspects of drug dealing.
IS CRIME RATIONAL?
It is relatively easy to show that some crimes are the product 
of rational, objective thought, especially when they involve 
an ongoing criminal conspiracy centered on economic gain. 
When prominent bankers in the savings and loan industry 
were indicted for criminal fraud, their elaborate fi nancial 
schemes exhibited not only signs of rationality but brilliant, 
though fl awed, fi nancial expertise.67 The stock market ma-
nipulations of Enron and WorldCom executives, the drug 
dealings of international cartels, and the gambling opera-
tions of organized crime bosses all demonstrate a reasoned 
analysis of market conditions, interests, and risks. Even 
small-time wheeler-dealers, such as the female drug dealers 
discussed earlier in the chapter, are guided by their rational 
assessment of the likelihood of apprehension and take pains 
to avoid detection. But what about common crimes of theft 
and violence? Are these rational acts or unplanned, haphaz-
ard, and spontaneous?
Is Theft Rational?
Some common theft-related crimes—larcenies, shoplift-
ing, purse snatchings—seem more likely to be random acts 
of criminal opportunity than well-thought-out conspira-
cies. However, there is evidence that even these seemingly 
unplanned events may be the product of careful risk as-
sessment, including environmental, social, and structural 
factors. For example, there are professional shoplifters, re-
ferred to as boosters, who use complex methods in order 
to avoid detection. They steal with the intention of reselling 
stolen merchandise to professional fences, another group of 
criminals who use cunning and rational decision making in 
their daily activities.
Burglars seem to be motivated by rational choice and 
show evidence of planning and thought. They carefully 
choose the neighborhood location of their crimes. They 
seem to avoid areas where residents protect their homes 
with alarms, locks, and other methods of “target harden-
ing” or where residents watch out for one another and try 
to control unrest or instability in their communities.68 Most 
burglars prefer to commit crimes in permeable neighbor-
hoods, those with a greater than usual number of access 
streets from traffi c arteries into the neighborhood.69 These 
areas are chosen for theft and break-ins because they are fa-
miliar and well traveled, they appear more open and vulner-
able, and they offer more potential escape routes.70 Burglars 
appear to monitor car and pedestrian traffi c and avoid se-
lecting targets on heavily traveled streets.71 Corner homes, 
usually near traffi c lights or stop signs, are the ones most 
likely to be burglarized: stop signs give criminals a legitimate 
reason to stop their cars and look for an attractive target.72 
Secluded homes, such as those at the end of a cul-de-sac or

112  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Though Brandon Wilson was seemingly a demented 
child killer, the jury concluded that he was a rational and 
calculating killer who may have carefully chosen his victim. 
Is it possible that violent acts, through which the offender 
gains little material benefi t, are the product of reasoned de-
cision making? Yes, it is. There are a number of indicators 
that suggest violence has rational elements. When Trevor 
Bennett and Fiona Brookman conducted interviews with 
English offenders with a history of violence, they found 
that some motivations were cultural, such as maintaining 
one’s status and honor, and others might be visceral, such 
as excitement and getting a buzz from dangerous pursuits. 
There were also rational elements to violent acts, such as 
calculating that the engagement would be successful or the 
perceived need to mete out informal justice to an enemy.80
Crime experts such as Richard Felson argue that violence is 
a matter of choice and serves specifi c goals:
Is Violence Rational?
Brandon Wilson, 21, slashed the throat of Matthew Cecchi, 
a 9-year-old California boy, then stabbed him in the back 
and left him to bleed to death on the fl oor of a public rest-
room. At trial, he claimed that he was not responsible for 
his actions, that he was high on LSD, and that the voice of 
God told him to kill a child. After his conviction on murder 
charges, Wilson told the jury that he would “do it again in a 
second if I had the chance.” When the jury later met to con-
sider the death penalty, Wilson told them, “My whole pur-
pose in life is to help destroy your society. You people are 
here as representatives of that society. As such, you should 
do everything in your power to rid the world of me, execute 
me.” Granting his wish, the jury foreman told reporters, “If 
there was ever a case that deserved the death penalty, this 
one fi ts.”79
fiscated can vary widely, from one gram 
to a kilo of drugs, or tens to thousands 
of dollars. If a dealer feels he or she may 
have been ripped off, the dealer may 
break into the victim’s apartment and 
take his plasma TV and a kilo of drugs.
Fraudulent retaliation
 
■
 is defined as non-
violent retribution accomplished using 
deception to trick a wrongdoer into an 
unfair trade. After being short-changed 
in a drug deal, fraudulent retaliation 
could involve selling their rival a gram 
or pound of fake drugs, as an instant 
revenge for the perceived wrongdoing. 
Some fraudulent retaliation schemes in-
volve immediate payback or may involve 
an elaborate scam that evolves over a 
matter of days, weeks, or even months.
Violent Retaliation
Violent confiscation
 
■
 is defined as retali-
ation that involves both violence and re-
source confiscation. Violent confiscation 
can involve taking money in amounts 
ranging from $1 to $1 million, one ounce 
or many pounds of drugs, and using 
violence to do so, ranging from a slap to 
the face to a murder. It can be immedi-
ate, such as a retaliatory robbery or take 
weeks—for example, during a retaliatory 
kidnapping
Pure fight
 
■
 is defined as violent ven-
geance that does not involve resource 
transfer between disputants. A pure 
fight may occur when a drug dealer feels 
a rival is poaching on his territory and 
decides to kill him in order to protect his 
turf and maintain his tough guy rep.
In some cases, victims use a tit-for-tat 
strategy. Dave, a drug dealer, was victim-
ized in an act of stealth retaliation and 
turned the tables on his victimizer. He told 
Jacques:
Dave: There was one time when some-
body didn’t pay me back, it was just 
about $300, and I had trusted the 
kid for a long time. He wasn’t paying 
upfront, I was just giving him the bud 
[marijuana] and he would sell it and 
give me the money later, and then it 
took about three weeks once, he still 
hadn’t given it to me, and I was trying 
to call him and get it from him . . . 
[A]nd another week or two passed and 
I started talking to a lot of people and 
I was putting some time into it trying 
to fi gure out what was going on, and 
Drug Dealer Retaliation
The way drug dealers retaliate for perceived 
wrongdoing shows a great deal of rational-
ity. We can observe this rational behavior 
when dealers seek to retaliate for perceived 
or real wrongdoing or when they compete 
for markets or seek retaliation for drug 
deals gone bad. Because participants in il-
licit drug markets are beyond the law and 
their respectability (i.e., status) is relatively 
low, disputes are unlikely to be settled by 
police or courts; they must “take care of 
business” themselves.
Recently, criminologist Scott Jacques 
investigated the forms of drug market re-
taliation and found they followed a rational 
pattern. After interviewing a sample of ex-
perienced drug dealers, Jacques found that 
dispute resolution can take four different 
forms, two involving nonviolent means and 
two violent.
Nonviolent Retaliation
Stealth retaliation
 
■
 is defined as nonvio-
lent revenge gained through resource 
confiscation without interaction between 
the retaliator and wrongdoer during the 
transfer. Stealth retaliation can involve 
any kind of resource, such as drugs, 
money, or jewelry, and the amount con-

do not pose any threat.82 In their survey of violent felons, 
James Wright and Peter Rossi found that robbers avoid vic-
tims who may be armed and dangerous. About three-fi fths 
of all felons interviewed were more afraid of armed victims 
than of police; about two-fi fths had avoided a victim be-
cause they believed the victim was armed; and almost one-
third reported that they had been scared off, wounded, or 
captured by armed victims.83 It comes as no surprise that 
cities with higher than average gun-carrying rates generally 
have lower rates of unarmed robbery.84
Robbers also tend to pick the time and day of crimes 
carefully. When they rob a commercial establishment, they 
choose the time when there is the most cash on hand to 
increase their take from the crime. For example, robbery 
rates increase in the winter partly because the Christmas 
shopping season means more money in the cash registers 
of potential targets.85 Targets are generally found close to 
Control.
 
■
 The violent person may want to control his or 
her victim’s behavior and life.
Retribution. 
 
■
The perpetrator may want punish someone 
without calling the police or using the justice system to 
address his or her grievances. The person takes the law 
into his or her own hands.
Deterrence.
 
■
 The attacker may want to stop someone from re-
peating acts that he or she considers hostile or provocative.
Reputation. 
 
■
An attack may be motivated by the need to 
enhance reputation and create self-importance in the 
eyes of others.
Felson also recognizes that the violent act may have mul-
tiple goals. But in any case, even violence may be a product 
of rational decision making.81
Rational Robbers Street robbers also are likely to choose 
victims who are vulnerable, have low coercive power, and 
out huge, you know I wasn’t that stupid 
at the time. Yeah, selling drugs on pro-
bation wasn’t smart. So I left it on my 
friend’s seat, and this was a friend in 
my group of 50, I’d say. He gave me a 
ride, I gave him 10 dimes for giving me 
a ride and so I put it in his car, went in 
there. Probation was never fast at that 
place . . . it was never a fast process, 
you were there 45 minutes to an hour. 
I came out, my buddy dropped me off 
. . . I counted them and tallied them and 
I don’t remember exactly how much I 
was supposed to have, but I was about 
300 to 400 short, but out of a bag of 
six or seven thousand Valiums you’re 
not gonna be able to tell 300, you just 
can’t tell. So I guess he probably had a 
couple of handfuls out of each bag . . . 
[S]o my friend [and I], we showed up 
at his house, beat the hell out of him 
and took every dollar he had, you know, 
just two guys on one. We weren’t gonna 
bloody him up or anything, just kind of 
beat the hell out of him, held him, took 
all the DVDs we could fi nd, obviously 
he had sold some, probably got about 
$600 back. I gave my friend $200 
[and] I took $400.
Each form of retaliation depends upon a 
number of personal and situational condi-
tions. For example, stealth retaliation is only 
possible if a wrongdoer physically separates 
from his or her wealth, while fraudulent re-
taliation and violent confiscation are only 
possible if a wrongdoer has contact with 
his or her wealth. Pure violence can take 
place regardless of whether the perceived 
wrongdoer has wealth. Stealth retaliation 
is possible when fraudulent retaliation and 
violent confiscation are not possible, and 
vice versa.
CRITICAL THINKING
Jacques’s research clearly suggests that 
drug dealers are rational decision makers 
whose choice of retaliation styles depends 
on personal and situational factors. Can you 
offer another explanation for their behavior 
that does not rely on rational choice? (Hint: 
Think of culture and environment.)

 Conditions for Retaliation: Toward a Theory of 
Non-Violent and Violent Forms in Drug Markets,”

they all said he wasn’t going to pay me, 
and the way he was talking about it 
was just really disrespectful. I just went 
over to his place with a couple of other 
kids that I know to do shit like this, but 
I don’t do shit like this unless someone 
has my money.
Interviewer: Do shit like what?
Dave: What I’m about to tell you. Well, 
basically, we just went up to his house 
and knocked on it for a little bit, but 
the music was so loud they couldn’t 
hear us, I guess his mom was out of 
town, and I saw that his car was right 
there, and I opened up his car door 
and stole his TV that he had actually 
stolen from somebody else.
William’s story, below, illustrates how a 
drug dealer took revenge by violently con-
fiscating the wrongdoer’s resources:
William: I was on probation . . . and I 
had a PO [parole offi cer] meeting and

seven thousand dimes [Valiums] and

have a license. So I’m not gonna walk 
in there with two cargo pockets bulging

114  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Even serial murderers, outwardly the most irrational 
of all offenders, tend to pick their targets with care. Most 
choose victims who are defenseless or who cannot count on 
police protection: prostitutes, gay men, hitchhikers, chil-
dren, hospital patients, the elderly, and the homeless. Rarely 
do serial killers target weightlifters, martial arts experts, or 
any other potentially powerful group.91
Are killers rational and calculating? Read the Profi les in 
Crime feature and judge for yourself.
Rational Sex Criminals? One might think that sex crimes 
are highly irrational, motivated by hate, lust, revenge, emo-
tions that defy rational planning. But sex criminals report 
using rational thought and planning when carrying out their 
crimes. Serial rapists rationally choose their targets. They 
travel, on average, three miles from their homes to commit 
their crimes in order to avoid victims who might recognize 
them later. The desire to avoid detection supersedes the 
wish to obtain a victim with little effort. Older, more ex-
perienced rapists who have extensive criminal histories are 
willing to travel farther; younger rapists who have less expe-
rience committing crimes travel less and are therefore more 
at risk of detection.92
Child molesters/rapists report that they volunteer or seek 
employment in day care centers and other venues where 
victims can be found. They use their status to gain the trust 
of children and to be seen as nonthreatening to the child. 
Within the context of this work environment they can then 
use subtle strategies of manipulation, such as giving love 
and attention to gain their victims’ trust (e.g., spending a lot 
of time with them), and they can gradually desensitize the 
children and gain their cooperation in sexual activity (e.g., 
through nonsexual touching).93 These efforts obviously dis-
play planning and rationality.
ELIMINATING CRIME
For many people, then, crime is attractive; it brings rewards, 
excitement, prestige, or other desirable outcomes without 
lengthy work or effort.94 Whether the motive is economic 
gain, revenge, or hedonism, crime has an allure that some peo-
ple cannot resist.95 Some law violators describe the adrenaline 
rush that comes from successfully executing illegal activities 
in dangerous situations as edgework, the “exhilarating, mo-
mentary integration of danger, risk, and skill” that motivates 
people to try a variety of dangerous criminal and noncriminal 
behaviors.96 Crime is not some random act, but a means that 
can provide both pleasure and solutions to vexing personal 
problems. As Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi put it, 
these criminals derive satisfaction from “money without work, 
sex without courtship, revenge without court delays.”97
robbers’ homes or in areas in which they routinely travel. 
Familiarity with the area gives them ready knowledge 
of escape routes; this is referred to as their “awareness 
space.”86 A familiar location allows them to blend in, not 
look out of place, and not get lost when returning home 
with their loot.87
Rational Killers? Hollywood likes to portray deranged 
people killing innocent victims at random, but people 
who carry guns and are ready to use them typically do so 
for more rational reasons. They may perceive that they live 
in a dangerous environment and carry a weapon for self-
protection. Some are involved in dangerous illegal activities 
such as drug dealing and carry weapons as part of the job.88
Even in apparently senseless killings among strangers, the 
conscious motive is typically revenge for a prior dispute or 
disagreement among the parties involved or their families.89
Many homicides are motivated by offenders’ desire to avoid 
retaliation from a victim they assaulted or to avoid future 
prosecutions by getting rid of witnesses.90 Although some 
killings are the result of anger and aggression, others are the 
result of rational planning.
Brandon Wilson, the accused killer of 9-year-old Matthew Cecchi, 
stands handcuffed in felony arraignment court in Vista, California. Can 
such violent acts ever be considered “rational”? Before you answer, 
remember that Wilson could have attacked a Marine, police officer, or 
kung fu expert, but instead “chose” a defenseless child.

CHAPTER 4 | Rational Choice Theory  115
SITUATIONAL CRIME 
PREVENTION
Desperate people may contemplate crime, but only the 
truly irrational would attack a well-defended, inaccessible 
target and risk strict punishment. Crime prevention can be 
achieved by reducing the opportunities people have to com-
mit particular crimes, a practice known as situational crime 
prevention. According to this concept, in order to reduce 
criminal activity, planners must be aware of the characteris-
tics of sites and situations that are at risk to crime; the things 
that draw or push people toward these sites and situations; 
what equips potential criminals to take advantage of illegal 
opportunities offered by these sites and situations; and what 
Considering its allure, how can crime be prevented or 
eliminated? It seems logical that if crime is rational and people 
choose to commit crime after weighing its rewards and benefi ts 
and factoring in their needs and abilities, then it can be con-
trolled or eradicated by convincing potential offenders that:
Crime is a poor choice that will not bring them re-
 
■
wards, but instead lead to hardship and deprivation.
Crime is not worth the effort. It is easier to work at a 
 
■
legitimate job than to evade police, outwit alarms, and 
avoid security.
Crime brings pain that is not easily forgotten. People 
 
■
who experience the pains of punishment will not read-
ily commit more crimes.
The following sections discuss each of these crime reduction 
or control strategies in some detail.
On July 8, 2010, Temkin met with an 
undercover agent in Encino, California, and 
paid him the first installment of a $30,000 
fee to carry out the murders. According to 
the plan, the murders were to be carried 
out in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Re-
public, when Hershman was on vacation. 
Temkin chose the Dominican Republic be-
cause “assassination in a third world coun-
try is . . . just another day in the park, and 
then it’s clean—it’s all over.”
Temkin bragged that he knew some local 
guys there who could “scoop up” the victim 
and keep him “hog-tied in a basement.” 
Another crew could “scoop up” the victim’s 
wife and children as leverage, and hold 
them as hostages. After being intimidated 
by the hit man, Hershman was to wire $5 
million to an untraceable bank account. The 
murder would take place after the money 
was handed over, though Temkin hadn’t 
figured out exactly how Hershman would 
“meet his final destiny.” The pseudo hit 
man recommended making the death look 
like a suicide, to which Temkin responded, 
“Suicide is a beautiful thing.” Another plan 
was to drop Hershman into the sea 10 miles 
from shore, giving the victim a chance at 
survival because, as Temkin told detec-
tives, “[Y]ou know, what doesn’t kill you 
makes you stronger. Well, I’m just making 
him stronger.” He then said, “Well, let them 
swim home. It’ll be a very, very, very good 
workout. An extremely good workout.”
Temkin provided the undercover agent 
photographs of the victims, as well as other 
identifying information. He also gave the 
undercover agent the information he would 
need to deposit the money into a bank ac-
count Temkin established in his name in 
Montevideo, Uruguay.
On July 27, 2010, Temkin was indicted 
on one count of soliciting a crime of vio-
lence, one count of attempting to interfere 
with interstate commerce by threats and 
violence, and one count of using interstate 
facilities in the commission of a murder-for-
hire. If convicted, he faces a statutory maxi-
mum sentence of 50 years in prison.

“Let Them Swim Home”
Eugene Temkin loaned his old buddy 
 Michael Hershman $500,000 to invest in a 
casino in Equatorial Guinea, Africa. When 
the casino didn’t do well, Hershman was 
unable to repay Temkin, who had taken 
the money from a second mortgage on an 
apartment building he owned. When the 
money was lost, Temkin couldn’t make pay-
ments on the property and eventually lost it 
to foreclosure. He then sued Hershman for 
$900,000 and was awarded $450,000, but 
much of it went to paying attorneys. Despite 
the lawsuit’s resolution, Temkin was relent-
less, demanding more money and refusing 
any attempts at compromise. Hershman 
even offered more cash and a job, but Tem-
kin declined. The two took out mutual re-
straining orders against one another.
For some people, that would have been 
the end of the story, but not for Eugene 
Temkin: he wanted revenge. He began 
asking people about hiring a hit man until 
someone who knew of his plotting informed 
police detectives of the plan. Over the fol-
lowing several months, undercover law 
enforcement personnel, posing as profes-
sional killers for hire, met with Temkin to 
discuss how to carry out the plot. Temkin 
wanted the hit man to first force Hershman 
to pay up and then have him killed.

visibility-blocking signs from store windows, installing 
brighter lights, and instituting a pay-fi rst policy can help re-
duce thefts from gas stations and convenience stores.107
Another way to increase effort is to reduce opportuni-
ties for criminal activity. Many cities have established curfew 
laws in an effort to limit the opportunity juveniles have to 
engage in antisocial behavior.108 However, curfew laws have 
not met with universal success.109 So another approach has 
been to involve kids in after-school programs that take up 
their time and reduce their opportunity to get in trouble. 
An example of this type of program is the Doorsteps Neigh-
bourhood Program in Toronto, Ontario, which is designed 
to help children in high-risk areas complete their school-
work as well as providing them with playtime that helps im-
prove their literacy and communication skills. Children who 
are part of this program enter into routines that increase the 
effort they must make if they want to get involved in after-
school crime and nuisance activities.110
Reduce Rewards Target reduction strategies are designed 
to reduce the value of crime to the potential criminal. These 
include making car radios removable so they can be kept in 
the home at night, marking property so that it is more dif-
fi cult to sell when stolen, and having gender-neutral phone 
listings to discourage obscene phone calls. Tracking systems, 
such as those made by the LoJack Corporation, help police 
locate and return stolen vehicles.
Increase Risk If criminals believe that committing crime 
is very risky, only the most foolhardy would attempt to 
commit criminal acts. Managing crime falls into the hands 
of people Marcus Felson calls crime discouragers.111 These 
discouragers can be grouped into three categories: guard-
ians, who monitor targets (such as store security guards); 
handlers, who monitor potential offenders (such as parole 
offi cers and parents); and managers, who monitor places 
(such as homeowners and doorway attendants). If crime 
discouragers do their job correctly, the potential criminal 
will be convinced that the risk of crime outweighs any po-
tential gains.112
Crime discouragers have different levels of responsibil-
ity, ranging from highly personal involvement, such as the 
homeowner protecting her house and the parent controlling 
his children, to the most impersonal general involvement, 
such as a stranger who stops someone from shoplifting in 
the mall (Exhibit 4.1).
Research indicates that crime discouragers can have an 
impact on crime rates. An evaluation of a police initiative in 
Oakland, California, found that an active working partner-
ship with residents and businesspeople who have a stake in 
maintaining order in their places of work or residences can 
reduce levels of drug dealing while at the same time increas-
ing civil behavior. Collective action and cooperation in solv-
ing problems were effective in controlling crime, whereas 
individual action (such as calling 911) seemed to have little 
effect.113
constitutes the immediate triggers for criminal actions.98 
Criminal acts will be avoided if (a) potential targets are 
guarded securely, (b) the means to commit crime are con-
trolled, and (c) potential offenders are carefully monitored.
Situational crime prevention was fi rst popularized in the 
United States in the early 1970s by Oscar Newman, who 
coined the term defensible space. This term signifi es that 
crime can be prevented or displaced through the use of resi-
dential architectural designs that reduce criminal opportunity, 
such as well-lit housing projects that maximize surveillance.99 
C. Ray Jeffery wrote Crime Prevention through Environmen-
tal Design, which extended Newman’s concepts and applied 
them to nonresidential areas, such as schools and factories.100 
According to this view, mechanisms such as security systems, 
deadbolt locks, high-intensity street lighting, and neighbor-
hood watch patrols should reduce criminal opportunity.101
In 1992, Ronald Clarke published Situational Crime 
Prevention, which compiled the best-known strategies and 
tactics to reduce criminal incidents.102 Criminologists have 
suggested using a number of situational crime prevention 
efforts that might reduce crime rates. One approach is not 
to target a specifi c crime but to create an environment that 
can reduce the overall crime rate by limiting the access to 
tempting targets for a highly motivated offender group (such 
as high school students).103
Targeting Specific Crimes 
Situational crime prevention can also involve developing tac-
tics to reduce or eliminate a specifi c crime problem (such as 
shoplifting in an urban mall or street-level drug dealing). Ac-
cording to Derek Cornish and Ronald Clarke, situational crime 
prevention efforts may be divided into fi ve strategies:104
Increase the effort needed to commit crime
 
■
Increase the risks of committing crime
 
■
Reduce the rewards for committing crime
 
■
Reduce provocation/induce guilt or shame for commit-
 
■
ting crime
Reduce excuses for committing crime
 
■
Increase Efforts Some of the tactics to increase efforts in-
clude target-hardening techniques such as putting unbreak-
able glass on storefronts, locking gates, and fencing yards. 
Technological advances can make it more diffi cult to com-
mit crimes; for example, having an owner’s photo on credit 
cards should reduce the use of stolen cards. The develop-
ment of new products, such as steering locks on cars, can 
make it more diffi cult to commit crimes. Empirical evidence 
indicates that steering locks have helped reduce car theft 
in the United States, Britain, and Germany.105 Installing a 
locking device on cars that prevents inebriated drivers from 
starting the vehicle (breath-analyzed ignition interlock de-
vice) signifi cantly reduces drunk-driving rates among peo-
ple with a history of driving while intoxicated.106 Removing

CHAPTER 4 | Rational Choice Theory  117
Clarke reports how caller ID in New Jersey resulted in sig-
nifi cant reductions in the number of obscene phone calls.115 
Megan’s Laws require sex offender registration and notifi ca-
tion systems. While these systems have been used for more 
than a decade, there is little evidence that they reduce sex 
crimes: research shows that sex offender registration does 
not have a statistically signifi cant effect on the number of 
rapes reported at the state level.116
Some crimes are the result of extreme provocation 
(e.g., road rage). It might be possible to reduce provoca-
tion by creating programs that reduce confl ict. Creating an 
early closing time in local bars might limit assaults that 
are the result of late night drinking, such as confl icts in 
pubs at closing time. Posting guards outside of schools at 
recess might prevent childish taunts from escalating into 
full-blown brawls. Antibullying programs that have been 
implemented in schools are another method of reducing 
provocation.
Remove Excuses Crime may be reduced by making it 
diffi cult for people to excuse their criminal behavior by say-
ing things like “I did not know that was illegal” or “I had no 
choice.” Some municipalities have set up roadside displays 
that electronically fl ash cars’ speed rate as they drive by, so 
that when stopped by police, drivers cannot say they did 
not know how fast they were going. Litter boxes, brightly 
displayed, can eliminate the claim that “I just did not know 
where to throw my trash.” Reducing or eliminating excuses 
also makes it physically easy for people to comply with laws 
and regulations, thereby reducing the likelihood they will 
choose crime.
In addition to crime discouragers, it may be possible to 
raise the risks of committing crime by creating mechanical 
devices that increase the likelihood that a criminal will be 
observed and captured. The Policy and Practice in Crimi-
nology feature “Reducing Crime through Surveillance” dis-
cusses a recent evaluation of such methods in Great Britain 
and other nations.
Increase Shame/Reduce Provocation Crime may be 
reduced or prevented if we can communicate to people 
the wrongfulness of their behavior and how it is harmful 
to society. We may tell them to “say no to drugs” or that 
“users are losers.” By making people aware of the shame-
fulness of their actions we hope to prevent their criminal 
activities even if chances of detection and punishment are 
slight.
Some efforts to make people ashamed of their acts are 
personal and provocative. Recently, a judge in Hudson, Kan-
sas, ordered a man who admitted to molesting an 11-year-
old boy to post “A Sex Offender Lives Here” signs on all four 
sides of his home and “A Sex Offender in this Car” in bold 
yellow lettering on the sides of his automobile.114 This order 
is typical for judges who have ordered people convicted of 
socially unacceptable crimes to advertise their guilt in the 
hope that they will be too ashamed to recidivate. “John lists” 
have also been published to shame men involved in hiring 
prostitutes.
Other methods of inducing guilt or shame might include 
such techniques as posting signs or warnings to embarrass 
potential offenders or creating mechanisms to identify per-
petrators and/or publicize their crimes. For example, Ronald

Diffusion.
 
■
 Sometimes efforts to prevent one crime help 
prevent another; in other instances, crime control ef-
forts in one locale reduce crime in another area.117 This 
effect is referred to as diffusion of benefi ts. Diffusion 
may be produced by two independent effects. Crime 
control efforts may deter criminals by causing them to 
fear apprehension. Video cameras set up in a mall to 
reduce shoplifting can also reduce property damage 
because would-be vandals fear they will be caught on 
Situational Crime Prevention: Costs and Benefits Some 
attempts at situational crime prevention have proven highly 
successful while others have not met their goals. However, 
it is now apparent that the approach brings with it certain 
nontransparent or hidden costs and benefi ts that can either 
increase effectiveness or undermine success. Before the over-
all success of this approach can be evaluated, these costs and 
benefi ts must be considered. Among the hidden benefi ts of 
situational crime control efforts are:
They found that effectiveness was sig-
nificantly correlated with the degree of 
coverage of the CCTV cameras, which was 
greatest in car parks. However, the effect 
was most pronounced in parking lots that 
also employed other situational crime pre-
vention interventions, such as improved 
lighting and security officers.
Notably, Welsh and Farrington found 
that CCTV schemes in the U.K. showed a 
sizable (19 percent) and significant desir-
able effect on crime, whereas those in other 
countries showed no desirable effect on 
crime. One reason was that all of the sites 
that used other interventions alongside 
CCTV were in England. It is possible that 
CCTV on its own is not sufficient to influ-
ence an offender’s decision whether to 
commit a crime and thus has to be but-
tressed by other methods, such as security 
fences or guards.
Another important issue is cultural con-
text. In the U.K., there is a high level of pub-
lic support for the use of CCTV cameras in 
public settings to prevent crime. In America 
and other nations, the public is less accept-
ing of surveillance technology and more 
apprehensive about its “Big Brother” con-
notations. Furthermore, in America, resis-
tance to the use of CCTV in public places 
also takes the form of legal action and 
constitutional challenges under the U.S. 
Constitution’s Fourth Amendment prohibi-
tion against unreasonable searches and 
seizures. In Sweden, surveillance cameras 
are highly regulated in public places, and in 
nearly all instances their use requires a per-
mit from the county administrative board. 
In Norway, there is a high degree of politi-
cal scrutiny of public CCTV schemes run by 
the police.
It could very well be that the overall poor 
showing of CCTV schemes in countries 
other than Britain is due in part to a lack of 
public support (and maybe even of political 
support) for these schemes, which in turn 
may result in reduced program funding, the 
police assigning lower priority to CCTV, and 
negative media reactions. Each of these 
factors could undermine the effectiveness 
of CCTV schemes. In contrast, the British 
Home Office, who funded many of the Brit-
ish evaluations, wanted to show that CCTV 
was effective because it had invested so 
much money in these schemes.
Welsh and Farrington conclude that 
CCTV reduces crime in some circum-
stances. In light of the mixed results, future 
CCTV schemes should be carefully imple-
mented in different settings and should 
employ high-quality evaluation designs with 
long follow-up periods.
CRITICAL THINKING
Would you be willing to have a surveil-
lance camera set up in your home or dorm 
in order to prevent crime, knowing that 
your every move was being watched and 
recorded?
SOURCE: Brandon C. Welsh and David P. Far-
rington, Making Public Places Safer: Surveillance 
and Crime Prevention (New York: Oxford University 
Press, 2008).
Brandon Welsh and David Farrington have 
been using systematic review and meta-
analysis to assess the comparative effec-
tiveness of situational crime prevention 
techniques. Recently, they evaluated the 
effectiveness of closed-circuit television 
(CCTV) surveillance cameras and improved 
street lighting, techniques that are currently 
being used around the world.
They find that CCTV surveillance cam-
eras serve many functions and are used in 
both public and private settings. CCTV can 
deter would-be criminals who fear detec-
tion and apprehension. They can also aid 
police in the detection and apprehension of 
suspects, aid in the prosecution of alleged 
offenders, improve police officer safety 
and compliance with the law (through, for 
instance, cameras mounted on the dash-
board of police cruisers to record police 
stops, searches, and so on), and aid in the 
detection and prevention of terrorist ac-
tivities. Nowhere is the popularity of CCTV 
more apparent than in Great Britain, where 
an estimated 4.2 million CCTV cameras, or 
1 for every 14 citizens, are in operation. It 
has been estimated that the average Briton 
is caught on camera 300 times each day.
After reviewing 41 studies conducted 
around the world, Welsh and Farrington 
found that CCTV interventions (a) have a 
small but significant desirable effect on 
crime, (b) are most effective in reducing 
crime in car parks (parking lots), (c) are 
most effective in reducing vehicle crimes, 
and (d) are more effective in reducing 
crime in the United Kingdom than in other 
countries.

note, in some cases street lighting improvement ef-
forts can backfi re and increase opportunities for crime. 
Well-lighted areas may bring a greater number of po-
tential victims and potential offenders into the same 
physical space. The increased visibility may allow 
potential offenders to make better judgments of target 
vulnerability and attractiveness (e.g., they can spot 
people with jewelry and other valuables). Lighting 
may make an area more attractive and increase social 
activity; increasing the number of unoccupied homes 
makes them available for burglary. Increased illumina-
tion may make it easier for offenders to commit crimes 
and to escape.123
Before the effectiveness of situational crime prevention 
can be accepted, these hidden costs and benefi ts must be 
weighed and balanced.
GENERAL DETERRENCE
According to the rational choice view, motivated, ratio-
nal people will violate the law if left free and unrestricted. 
General deterrence theory holds that crime rates are in-
fl uenced and controlled by the threat and/or application 
of criminal punishment. If people fear being apprehended 
and punished, they will not risk breaking the law. An in-
verse relationship should then exist between crime rates 
and the fear of legal sanctions. If, for example, the pun-
ishment for a crime is increased and the effectiveness and 
effi ciency of the criminal justice system are improved, then 
the number of people willing to risk committing crime 
should decline.
The severity, certainty, and speed of punishment are in-
terrelated. If a particular crime—say, robbery—is punished 
severely, but few robbers are ever caught or punished, the 
severity of punishment for robbery will probably not deter 
people from robbing. However, if the certainty of appre-
hension and conviction is increased by modern technology, 
more effi cient police work, or some other factor, then even 
minor punishment might deter the potential robber.
Deterrence theorists tend to believe that the certainty of 
punishment seems to have a greater impact than its sever-
ity or speed. In other words, people will more likely be de-
terred from crime if they believe that they will get caught; 
what happens to them after apprehension seems to have less 
impact.124 Nonetheless, all three elements of the deterrence 
equation are important, and it would be a mistake to em-
phasize one at the expense of the others. For example, if all 
resources were given to police agencies to increase the prob-
ability of arrest, crime rates might increase because there 
were insuffi cient funds for swift prosecution and effective 
correction.125
camera. One recent police program targeting drugs in 
areas of Jersey City, New Jersey, also reduced public 
morals crimes because potential offenders were aware 
of increased police patrols.118
Discouragement. 
 
■
Sometimes crime control efforts target-
ing a particular locale help reduce crime in surrounding 
areas and populations; this is referred to as discourage-
ment. In her study of the effects of the SMART program 
(a drug enforcement program in Oakland, California, 
that enforces municipal codes and nuisance abatement 
laws), criminologist Lorraine Green found that not only 
did drug dealing decrease in targeted areas, but im-
provement was found in adjacent areas as well. She sug-
gests that the program most likely discouraged buyers 
and sellers who saw familiar hangouts closed. This sign 
that drug dealing would not be tolerated probably de-
creased the total number of people involved in drug ac-
tivity even though they did not operate in the targeted 
areas.119 Another example of this effect can be found 
in evaluations of the LoJack auto protection system. 
LoJack uses a hidden radio transmitter to track stolen 
cars. As the number of LoJack installations rises, police 
notice that the sale of stolen auto parts declines. It ap-
pears that people in the illegal auto parts business (that 
is, chop shops) close down because they fear that the 
stolen cars they buy might contain LoJack.120 A device 
designed to protect cars from theft also has the benefi t 
of disrupting the sale of stolen car parts.
While there are hidden benefits to situational crime 
prevention, there may also be costs that limit their 
effectiveness:
Displacement.
 
■
 A program that seems successful be-
cause it helps lower crime rates at specifi c locations or 
neighborhoods may simply be redirecting offenders to 
alternative targets; this is known as displacement, as 
crime is not prevented but defl ected or displaced.121 
Beefed-up police patrols in one area may shift crimes to 
a more vulnerable neighborhood.122
Extinction.
 
■
 Sometimes crime reduction programs may 
produce a short-term positive effect, but benefi ts dissi-
pate as criminals adjust to new conditions. They learn 
to dismantle alarms or avoid patrols; they may try new 
offenses they had previously avoided. And elimination 
of one crime may encourage commission of another: 
if every residence in a neighborhood has a foolproof 
burglar alarm system, motivated offenders may be 
forced to turn to armed robbery, a riskier and more 
violent crime.
Encouragement.
 
■
 Crime reduction programs may boo-
merang and increase rather than decrease the poten-
tiality for crime. For example, some situational efforts 
rely on increasing the risk of crime by installing street 
lighting, assuming that rational criminals will avoid 
areas where their criminal activities are more visible. 
However, as Brandon Welsh and David Farrington

120  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
the most motivated crimi-
nal may desist because the 
risks of crime outweigh its 
rewards.130 If people believe 
that their criminal transgres-
sions will result in appre-
hension and punishment, 
then only the truly irrational 
will commit crime.131 Con-
sidering this association, it 
is common for crime control 
efforts to be aimed at con-
vincing rational criminals 
to avoid the risk of crime. 
Take for instance Project 
Safe Neighborhoods, which 
was the centerpiece of the 
government’s crime policy in 
President George W. Bush’s 
first term. Safe Neighbor-
hoods relied on media cam-
paigns aimed at convincing 
people that carrying hand-
guns was a serious crime for 
which they would be caught, 
prosecuted, and severely punished with mandatory prison 
sentences. Evaluations suggest that the program worked and 
gun crimes declined after the program was instituted.132
The Tipping Point Unfortunately for deterrence theory, 
punishment is not very certain. Only 10 percent of all seri-
ous offenses result in apprehension (half go unreported, and 
police make arrests in about 20 percent of reported crimes). 
Police routinely do not arrest suspects in personal disputes 
even when they lead to violence.133 As apprehended offend-
ers are processed through all the stages of the criminal jus-
tice system, the odds of their receiving serious punishment 
diminish. As a result, some offenders believe they will not 
be severely punished for their acts and consequently have 
little regard for the law’s deterrent power.
Criminologists maintain that if the certainty of punish-
ment could be increased to a critical level, the so-called tipping 
point, then the deterrent effect would kick in and crime rates 
would decline.134 Crime persists because we have not reached 
the tipping point, and most criminals believe that (a) there 
is only a small chance they will be arrested for committing a 
particular crime, (b) police offi cers are sometimes reluctant to 
make arrests even when they are aware of crime, and (c) even 
if apprehended there is a good chance of either getting off to-
tally or receiving a lenient punishment such as probation.135
One way of increasing the tipping point may be to add 
police offi cers. As the number of active, aggressive, crime-
fi ghting cops increases, arrests and convictions should like-
wise increase, and would-be criminals will be convinced 
that the risk of apprehension outweighs the benefi ts they 
can gain from crime.136
Perception and Deterrence 
According to deterrence theory, not only does the actual chance 
of punishment infl uence criminality, so too does the perception 
of punishment.126 A central theme of deterrence theory is that 
people who perceive they will be punished for crimes in the 
future will avoid doing those crimes in the present.127 The ac-
tual likelihood of being arrested or imprisoned will have little 
effect on crime rates if criminals believe that they have only a 
small chance of suffering apprehension and punishment.128
To prove the association between perception and deter-
rence empirically, Canadian criminologists Etienne Blais and 
Jean-Luc Bacher conducted an interesting experiment: they 
had insurance companies send a written threat to a random 
sample of insured persons reminding them of the punish-
ment for insurance fraud, and then compared the claims 
they fi led with a control group of people who did not get 
the threatening letter. Blais and Bacher found that those who 
got the letter were less likely to pad their claims than were 
those in the control group.129 Clearly the written warning 
that offenders will be caught and punished for insurance 
fraud deterred illegal activity.
Certainty of Punishment 
and Deterrence
According to deterrence theory, if the probability of arrest, 
conviction, and sanctioning increases, crime rates should 
decline. As the certainty of punishment increases, even 
Police officers in riot gear take control of State Street in downtown Madison, Wisconsin, after the city’s 
annual Halloween bash. According to the theory of general deterrence, aggressive police action will reduce 
the likelihood that would-be criminals (in this case, rioters) would dare to violate the law.

a policy of aggressively pursuing truancy and curfew en-
forcement, they found that the effort actually lowered rates 
of gang violence.145 A month-long crackdown and cleanup 
initiative in Richmond, Virginia, in seven city neighbor-
hoods found that crime rates declined by 92 percent; the ef-
fects persisted up to six months after the crackdown ended, 
and no displacement was observed.146 Police seem to have 
more luck deterring crime when they use more focused ap-
proaches, such as aggressive problem-solving and commu-
nity improvement techniques.147 Merely saturating an area 
with police may not deter crime, but focusing efforts on a 
particular problem area has a deterrent effect.
Severity of Punishment 
and Deterrence
According to general deterrence theory, as the severity of 
punishment increases, crime rates should decrease. Does 
this equation hold water? The evidence is decidedly mixed. 
While some studies have found that increasing sanction lev-
els can control common criminal behaviors, others have not 
achieved a positive result.148
Take the case of enhancing punishment: in order to con-
trol handguns, a state might add fi ve years to a sentence if 
a handgun was used during the crime. However, it is often 
diffi cult to determine if such measures actually work. When 
Daniel Kessler and Steven Levitt evaluated the deterrent ef-
fect of California’s sentencing enhancement act, they found 
that it did in fact lower crime rates.149 However, gun crimes 
went down in other states that did not enhance or increase 
their sentences!150 What appears to be a deterrent effect 
may be the result of some other factor, such as an improved 
economy.
It stands to reason that if severity of punishment can de-
ter crime, then fear of the death penalty, the ultimate legal 
deterrent, should signifi cantly reduce murder rates. Because 
no one denies its emotional impact, failure of the death pen-
alty to deter violent crime would jeopardize the validity of 
the entire deterrence concept. Because this topic is so im-
portant, it is featured in The Criminological Enterprise.
Even if capital punishment proves to be a deterrent, 
many experts still question its morality, fairness, and 
legality. Chapters 14 and 16 provide further discussion 
that can help you decide whether the death penalty is 
an appropriate response to murder.
CONNECTIONS
Shame and Humiliation Fear of shame and embarrass-
ment can be a powerful deterrent to crime. Those who fear 
being rejected by family and peers are reluctant to engage in 
deviant behavior.151 These factors manifest themselves in two 
While adding cops seems a logical way of reducing 
crime, this assumption has been questioned ever since a 
famous experiment was conducted in the early 1970s by 
the Kansas City, Missouri, Police Department.137 To evalu-
ate the effectiveness of police patrols, 15 independent Kan-
sas City police beats or districts were divided into three 
groups. The fi rst (active) retained a normal police patrol; 
the second (proactive) was supplied with two to three 
times the normal number of patrol forces; the third (reac-
tive) eliminated its preventive patrol entirely, and police 
offi cers responded only when summoned by citizens to the 
scene of a crime.
Surprisingly, these variations in patrol techniques had 
little effect on the crime patterns. Variations in police patrol 
techniques also appeared to have little effect on citizens’ at-
titudes toward the police, their satisfaction with police, or 
their fear of future criminal behavior. It is possible that as 
people traveled around the city they noticed a large number 
of police offi cers in one area and relatively few in another; 
the two effects may have cancelled each other out!
While subsequent research using sophisticated meth-
odological tools found evidence that increased police levels 
does over time reduce the level of criminal activity, it has 
been hard to shake the infl uence of the Kansas City study.138
It had convinced criminologists that the mere presence of 
patrol offi cers on the street did not have a deterrent effect.
Just recently, in fact, John Worrall and Tomislav Kovandzic 
found that cities that increased the size of their patrol force 
were the ones most likely to experience a reduction in crime. 
Perhaps the fi ndings of the Kansas City study had created a 
“rush to judgment”?139
One reason for this disconnect may be found in the 
manner in which police offi cers approach their job. What 
happens if police offi cers engage in aggressive, focused crime-
fi ghting initiatives, targeting specifi c crimes such as murder 
or robbery? Would such activities result in more arrests and 
a greater deterrent effect?140 To answer this question, some 
police departments have instituted crackdowns—sudden 
changes in police activity designed to increase the com-
municated threat or actual certainty of punishment. For 
example, a police task force might target street-level nar-
cotics dealers by using undercover agents and surveillance 
cameras in known drug-dealing locales. Crackdown efforts 
have met with mixed reviews.141 In one well-known study, 
Lawrence Sherman found that while crackdowns initially 
deterred crime, crime rates returned to earlier levels once 
the crackdown ended.142 Other research efforts have also 
found that while at fi rst successful as a crime suppression 
technique, the initial effect of the crackdown soon wore off 
after high-intensity police activity ended.143
Although these results are troubling, there is some evi-
dence that when police combine crackdowns with the use 
of aggressive problem-solving and community improvement 
techniques, such as increasing lighting and cleaning vacant 
lots, crackdowns may be successful in reducing some forms 
of crime.144 When the Dallas Police Department established

122  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Comparative Research
Another type of research compares the 
murder rates in jurisdictions that have 
abolished the death penalty with the rates 
of those that employ the death penalty. 
Studies using this approach have found 
little difference in the murder rates of ad-
jacent states, regardless of their use of the 
death penalty; capital punishment did not 
appear to influence the reported rate of ho-
micide. Research conducted in 14 nations 
around the world found little evidence that 
countries with a death penalty have lower 
violence rates than those without; homicide 
rates actually decline after capital punish-
ment is abolished, a direct contradiction to 
its supposed deterrent effect.
Time-Series Studies
Time-series studies look at the long-term as-
sociation between capital sentencing and 
murder. If capital punishment is a deterrent, 
then periods that have an upswing in execu-
tions should also experience a downturn in 
violent crime and murder. Most research ef-
forts have failed to show such a relationship. 
One test of the deterrent effect of the death 
penalty in Texas by Jon Sorenson and his 
colleagues found no association between 
the frequency of execution and murder 
rates during the years 1984 to 1997. Matt 
Breverlin used data gathered from 1974 to 
2001 in all 50 states to demonstrate that the 
death penalty for juveniles has no statisti-
cally significant deterrent effect. His conclu-
sion is that state-level economic conditions, 
population density, and incarceration rates 
have a much greater impact on the juve-
nile murder rate than the deterrent impact 
of the death penalty. These findings seem 
to indicate that the threat and/or reality of 
execution has relatively little influence on 
murder rates. Although it is still uncertain 
why the threat of capital punishment fails 
as a deterrent, the cause may lie in the 
nature of homicide itself. Murder is often 
an expressive “crime of passion” involving 
people who know each other and who may 
be under the influence of drugs and alco-
hol. Those who choose to take a life may be 
less influenced by the threat of punishment, 
even death, than those who commit crime 
for economic gain.
Rethinking the Deterrent Effect of 
Capital Punishment
In contrast to these results, some recent 
studies have concluded that executing 
criminals may, in fact, bring the murder 
rate down. Those who still maintain that 
an association exists between capital pun-
ishment and murder rate believe that the 
relationship has been masked or obscured 
by faulty research methods. Newer stud-
ies, using sophisticated data analysis, have 
been able to uncover a more significant 
association. For example, criminologist 
Steven Stack has conducted a number of 
research studies that show that the imme-
diate impact of a well-publicized execu-
tion can lower the murder rate during the 
following month. James Yunker, using a 
national data set, has found evidence that 
there is a deterrent effect of capital pun-
ishment now that the pace of executions 
has accelerated. Economists Hashem De-
zhbakhsh, Paul H. Rubin, and Joanna M. 
Shepherd performed an advanced statisti-
cal analysis on county-level homicide data 
in order to calculate the effect of each ex-
ecution on the number of homicides that 
would otherwise have occurred. Using a 
Does Capital Punishment Deter Murder?
According to deterrence theory, the death 
penalty—the ultimate deterrent—should 
deter murder—the ultimate crime. Most 
Americans approve of the death penalty, 
including, as Norma Wilcox and Tracey 
Steele found, convicted criminals who are 
currently behind bars. But is the public’s 
approval warranted? Does the death pen-
alty actually deter murder?
Empirical research on the association 
between capital punishment and murder 
can be divided into three types: immediate 
impact studies, comparative research, and 
time-series analysis.
Immediate Impact
If capital punishment is a deterrent, the 
reasoning goes, then its impact should be 
greatest after a well-publicized execution. 
Robert Dann began testing this assumption 
in 1935 when he chose five highly publi-
cized executions of convicted murderers in 
different years and determined the number 
of homicides in the 60 days before and af-
ter each execution. Each 120-day period 
had approximately the same number of 
homicides, as well as the same number of 
days on which homicides occurred. Dann’s 
study revealed that an average of 4.4 more 
homicides occurred during the 60 days fol-
lowing an execution than during those pre-
ceding it, suggesting that the overall impact 
of executions might actually be an increase 
in the incidence of homicide. Seventy years 
later when Lisa Stolzenberg and Stewart 
D’Alessio examined the effect of the death 
penalty on the murder rate in Houston, 
Texas, they also found that even when ex-
ecutions were highly publicized in the local 
press, they still had little influence on the 
murder rate.

ways: (1) personal shame over violating the law and (2) the 
fear of public humiliation if the deviant behavior becomes 
public knowledge. People who say that their involvement 
in crime would cause them to feel ashamed are less likely to 
offend than people who deny fears of embarrassment.152
People who are afraid that signifi cant others—such as 
parents, peers, neighbors, and teachers—will disapprove 
of their behavior are less likely to commit crime.153 While 
shame can be a powerful deterrent, offenders also seem to 
be infl uenced by forgiveness and acceptance. They are less 
likely to repeat their criminal activity if victims are willing to 
grant them forgiveness.154
The fear of exposure and consequent shaming may vary 
according to the cohesiveness of community structure and

more than 100 people have been wrong-
fully convicted and sentenced to death in 
the United States. And according to re-
search sponsored by the Pew Foundation, 
a majority of death penalty convictions have 
been overturned, many due to “serious, 
reversible error,” including egregiously in-
competent defense counsel, suppression 
of exculpatory evidence, false confessions, 
racial manipulation of the jury, “snitch” 
and accomplice testimony, and faulty jury 
instructions.
After years of study, the death penalty 
remains a topic of considerable criminologi-
cal debate.
CRITICAL THINKING
Even if effective, there is no question the 
death penalty can cause problems. For 
example, when Geoffrey Rapp studied the 
effect of the death penalty on the safety of 
police officers, he found that the introduc-
tion of capital punishment actually cre-
ated an extremely dangerous environment 
for law enforcement officers. Because the 
death penalty does not have a deterrent ef-
fect, criminals are more likely to kill police 
officers when the death penalty is in place. 
Tragically, the death penalty may lull offi-
cers into a false sense of security, causing 
them to let down their guard—killing fewer 
citizens but getting killed more often them-
selves. Given Rapp’s findings, should we 
still maintain the death penalty?

variety of models (for example, the effect of 
an execution conducted today on reducing 
homicides in five years, and so on), they 
found that each execution leads to an aver-
age of 18 fewer murders. In another study, 
Shepherd claims that the reason some re-
search has not found a deterrent effect is 
because capital punishment may have dif-
fering influence depending on where and 
how it is used. Calculating each state’s 
murder rate separately and lumping all 
state data together masks the deterrent ef-
fect of the death penalty. She found that the 
use of capital punishment deterred murder 
in states that conducted more executions 
than the norm. In contrast, in states that 
conducted relatively few executions (one or 
two per year), the average execution either 
increased the murder rate or had no effect. 
Shepherd concludes that each execution 
has two opposing effects. It can contribute 
to a climate of brutal violence (i.e., the bru-
talization effect) that tells people it is okay to 
kill in revenge. It can also act as a deterrent 
and show potential criminals that the state 
is willing to use the ultimate penalty to pun-
ish crimes. However, only if a state routinely 
uses executions does the deterrent effect 
take place; only then do potential criminals 
become convinced that the state is serious 
about the punishment, so that the criminals 
start to reduce their criminal activity.
These efforts contradict findings that 
capital punishment fails as a deterrent. So 
on the one hand, the most recent research 
indicates that the death penalty is being 
used more frequently, it is possible that 
the tipping point has been reached, and it 
is now an effective deterrent measure. On 
the other hand, capital punishment still 
carries significant baggage: since 1976, 
the type of crime. Informal sanctions may be most effec-
tive in highly unifi ed areas where everyone knows one an-
other and the crime cannot be hidden from public view. The 
threat of informal sanctions seems to have the greatest infl u-
ence on instrumental crimes, which involve planning, and 
not on impulsive or expressive criminal behaviors or those 
associated with substance abuse.155
Speed (Celerity) of Punishment 
and Deterrence
The third leg of Becarria’s equation involves the celerity or 
speed of punishment: the faster punishment is applied and 
the more closely it is linked to the crime, the more likely it 
will serve as a deterrent.156 The deterrent effect of the law

who have a long history of criminality, know that crimes pro-
vide immediate gratifi cation, whereas the threat of punish-
ment is far in the future.161
Restrictive/Partial Deterrence Deterrence is rarely an 
all or nothing proposition: some crimes are more deterrable 
than others; some criminals are more deterrable. Deterrence 
measures may not eliminate crime but reduce or restrict its 
occurrence. Deterrence measures may not totally convince 
criminals that crime does not pay, but might help increase 
their sensitivity to the risks involved in crime and thereby 
alter or shape their decision making. For example, crimi-
nologist Bruce Jacobs has identifi ed the concept of restric-
tive deterrence, a phenomenon that occurs when deterrence 
measures convince would-be criminals that the risk of com-
mitting a particular crime is just too great. Potential crimi-
nals then fi nd ways to adapt to this perceived threat:
 1. The offender reduces the number of crimes he or she 
commits during a particular period of time.
 2. The offender commits less-serious crimes, assuming that 
even if he or she is apprehended, the punishment will 
not be as severe for a more minor infraction (thus, an 
offender shoplifts a $100 pair of jeans instead of robbing 
a convenience store for the same monetary reward).
 3. The offender takes actions to reduce the chance that he 
or she will be caught and to increase the chance that the 
contemplated offense will be undertaken without risk of 
detection (e.g., wearing a disguise to avoid being identi-
fi ed by the victim).
 4. Recognizing danger, the offender commits the same 
crime at a different place or time.162
Analyzing General Deterrence
Some experts believe that the purpose of the law and justice 
system is to create a “threat system.”163 That is, the threat of 
legal punishment should, on the face of it, deter lawbreak-
ers through fear. Nonetheless, as we have already discussed, 
the relationship between crime rates and deterrent measures 
is far less clear than choice theorists might expect. Despite 
efforts to punish criminals and make them fear crime, there 
is little evidence that the fear of apprehension and punish-
ment alone can reduce crime rates. How can this discrep-
ancy be explained?
Rationality Deterrence theory assumes a rational offender 
who weighs the costs and benefi ts of a criminal act before de-
ciding on a course of action. In many instances, criminals are 
desperate people who suffer from personality disorders that 
impair their judgment and render them incapable of making 
truly rational decisions.164 It is doubtful that any deterrent 
measure could have infl uenced an irrational Jared Loughner 
when he attempted to assassinate U.S. Representative Gabri-
elle Giffords on January 8, 2011. They may be impulsive and 
imprudent rather than reasoning and calculating.
may be neutralized if there is a signifi cant lag between ap-
prehension and punishment. In the American justice system, 
court delays brought by numerous evidentiary hearings and 
requests for additional trial preparation time are common 
trial tactics. As a result, the criminal process can be delayed 
to a point where the connection between crime and punish-
ment is broken. Take for instance how the death penalty is 
employed. As Table 4.1 shows, more than 10 years typically 
elapse between the time a criminal is convicted for murder 
and his or her execution. During that period, many death 
row inmates have repented, matured, and turned their lives 
around, only to be taken out and executed. Delay in its ap-
plication may mitigate or neutralize the potential deterrent 
effect of capital punishment.
The threat of punishment may also be neutralized by the 
belief that even if caught criminals can avoid severe pun-
ishment through plea negotiations. The fact that killers can 
avoid the death penalty by bargaining for a life sentence may 
also undermine the deterrent effect of the law.157
Research indicates that, in general, the deterrence and re-
tributive value of a given criminal sanction steadily decreases 
as the lag between crime and punishment lengthens. Because 
criminals discount punishments that lag behind their crimes, 
how and when punishment is applied can alter its effect. A 
criminal who is apprehended, tried, and convicted soon after 
committing a crime will be more deeply affected than one 
who experiences a signifi cant lag between crime and punish-
ment.158 Criminologist Raymond Paternoster found that ad-
olescents, a group responsible for a disproportionate amount 
of crime, may be well aware that the juvenile court is gen-
erally lenient about imposing meaningful sanctions on even 
the most serious juvenile offenders.159 Even those accused of 
murder are often convicted of lesser offenses and spend rela-
tively short amounts of time behind bars.160 Not surprisingly, 
the more experience a kid has with the juvenile justice sys-
tem, the less deterrent effect it has: crime-prone youth, ones

others.173 Some people may be suffering from personality 
disorders and mental infi rmity, which make them immune 
to the deterrent power of the law.174 However, for some 
crimes, where a small group of chronic offenders (for ex-
ample, dealers in illegal fi rearms) are responsible for a great 
majority of the criminal activity, a targeted strategy that 
directs a surge of law enforcement activity against repeat 
offenders may help reduce crime even in the most disorga-
nized neighborhoods.175
It also appears that it is easier to deter offenders from 
some crimes than from others. A recent (2009) meta-analysis 
of the existing literature shows that the most significant 
deterrent effects can be achieved on minor petty crimi-
nals, whereas more serious offenders such as murderers are 
harder to discourage.176 Because criminals may more readily 
deterred from committing some crimes—such as tax non-
compliance, speeding, and illegal parking—future research 
should be directed at identifying and targeting these pre-
ventable offenses.177
SPECIFIC DETERRENCE
The theory of specific deterrence (also called special or 
particular deterrence) holds that after experiencing criminal 
sanctions that are swift, sure, and powerful, known crimi-
nals will never dare repeat their criminal acts. While general 
deterrence relies on the perception of future punishments, 
specifi c deterrence relies on its application:
The drunk driver whose sentence is a substantial fi ne 
 
■
and a week in the county jail should be convinced that 
the price to be paid for drinking and driving is too great 
to consider future violations.
The burglar who spends fi ve years in a tough maxi-
 
■
mum security prison will fi nd his enthusiasm for theft 
dampened.
The tax cheat who is assessed triple damages will think 
 
■
twice before fi ling a false return.
In principle, punishment works if a connection can be 
established between the planned action and memories of its 
consequence; if these recollections are adequately intense, 
the action will be unlikely to occur again.178 Yet, the con-
nection between experiencing punishment and fearing fu-
ture punishment is not always as strong as expected.179
At first glance, specific deterrence does not seem to 
work because a majority of known criminals are not de-
terred by their punishment. Arrest and punishment seem 
to have little effect on experienced criminals and may even 
increase the likelihood that fi rst-time offenders will com-
mit new crimes.180 A sentence to a juvenile justice facility 
does little to deter a persistent delinquent from becoming an 
adult criminal.181 Most prison inmates had prior records of 
Compulsion We know that a relatively small group of 
chronic offenders commits a signifi cant percentage of all se-
rious crimes. Some psychologists believe this select group 
suffers from an innate or inherited emotional state that ren-
ders them both incapable of fearing punishment and less 
likely to appreciate the consequences of crime.165 Research 
shows that people who are easily aroused sexually also say 
that they will be more likely to act in a sexually aggressive 
fashion and not consider the legal consequences of their ac-
tions.166 Their heightened emotional state negates the deter-
rent effect of the law.
Need Many offenders are members of what is referred 
to as the underclass—people cut off from society, lacking 
the education and skills they need to be in demand in the 
modern economy.167 Such desperate people may not be de-
terred from crime by fear of punishment because, in reality, 
they perceive few other options for success. Among poor, 
high-risk groups, such as teens living in economically de-
pressed neighborhoods, the threat of formal sanctions is 
irrelevant.168 Young people in these areas have less to lose 
because their opportunities are few, and they have little at-
tachment to social institutions such as school or family. In 
their environment, they see many people who appear rela-
tively well off (the neighborhood drug dealer) committing 
crimes without getting caught or punished.169
Greed Some may be immune to deterrent effects because 
they believe the profits from crime are worth the risk of 
punishment; it may be their only signifi cant chance for gain 
and profi t. When criminologists Alex Piquero and George 
Rengert studied active burglars, they found that the lure of 
criminal profi ts outweighed their fears of capture and sub-
sequent punishment. Perceived risk of punishment may de-
ter some potential and active criminal offenders, but only if 
they doubt that they can make a “big score” from commit-
ting a crime.170
Greed may encourage some law violators to overestimate 
the rewards of crime that in reality are often quite meager. 
When Steven Levitt and Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh studied 
the fi nancial rewards of being in a drug gang, they found 
that despite enormous risks to health, life, and freedom, av-
erage gang members earned only slightly more than what 
they could in the legitimate labor market (about $6 to $11 
per hour).171 Why then did they stay in the gang? Members 
believed that there was a strong potential for future riches 
if they stayed in the drug business and earned a “manage-
ment” position (i.e., gang leaders earned a lot more). De-
terrence is neutralized because the gang boys’ greed causes 
them to overestimate the potential for future criminal gain 
versus the probability of apprehension and punishment.172

Yet, they also show that achieving specifi c deterrent effects 
may sometimes be elusive. In the classic study, Lawrence 
Sherman and Richard Berk had police offi cers in Minneapo-
lis, Minnesota, randomly assign one of three outcomes to do-
mestic assault cases they encountered on their beats:192
Advice and mediation only
 
■
Remove the assailant from the home for a period of 
 
■
eight hours
Formally arrest the assailant
 
■
According to deterrence theory, arrest should have 
a greater impact than advice and mediation, and in this 
case it did. Sherman and Berk found that when police took 
formal action (arrest), the chance of recidivism was sub-
stantially less than with less punitive measures, such as 
warning offenders or ordering offenders out of the house 
for a cooling-off period. A six-month follow-up found that 
only 10 percent of those who were arrested repeated their 
violent behavior, while 19 percent of those advised and 
24 percent of those sent away repeated their offenses. Sher-
man and Berk concluded that a formal arrest was the most 
effective means of controlling domestic violence, regard-
less of what happened to the offender in court, and the 
specifi c deterrent effect of arrest produced positive long-
term outcomes.
The Minneapolis experiment deeply affected police op-
erations around the nation. Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Den-
ver, Detroit, New York, Miami, San Francisco, and Seattle, 
among other large cities, adopted policies encouraging ar-
rests in domestic violence cases. A number of states adopted 
legislation mandating that police either take formal action 
in domestic abuse cases or explain in writing their failure 
to act. Nonetheless, replicating the Minneapolis experiment 
in five other locales—including Omaha, Nebraska, and 
Charlotte, North Carolina—failed to duplicate the original 
results.193 In these locales, formal arrest was not a greater 
deterrent to domestic abuse than warning or advising the 
assailant.
More recent efforts to link punishment and deter-
rence in domestic violence cases have also produced in-
conclusive results. One recent examination conducted by 
Andrew Klein and Terri Tobin of the abuse and criminal 
careers of 342 men arraigned in the Quincy, Massachusetts, 
District Court found that batterers were undeterred by ar-
rest, prosecution, probation supervision, incarceration, 
and treatment. Although only a minority of the men in the 
study reabused (32 percent) or were arrested for any crime 
(43 percent) within a year of their fi rst involvement with 
the justice system, over the next decade, the majority 
(60 percent) were involved in a second incident and almost 
three-fourths were rearrested for a domestic abuse or non-
domestic abuse crime. The implications of the domestic 
violence research is that even if punishment can produce a 
short-term specifi c deterrent effect, it fails to produce lon-
ger-term behavior change.194
arrest and conviction before their current offenses.182 About 
two-thirds of all convicted felons are rearrested within three 
years of their release from prison, and those who have been 
punished in the past are the most likely to recidivate.183 In-
carceration may sometimes slow down or delay recidivism 
in the short term, but the overall probability of rearrest does 
not change following incarceration.184
According to the theory of specific deterrence, the 
harsher the punishment, the less likely the chances of re-
cidivism. But research shows that this is not always the case. 
Offenders sentenced to prison do not have lower rates of 
recidivism than those receiving more lenient community 
sentences for similar crimes. White-collar offenders who 
receive prison sentences are as likely to recidivate as those 
who receive community-based sanctions.185
In some instances, rather than reducing the frequency of 
crime, severe punishments may actually increase reoffend-
ing rates.186 Some states are now employing high-security 
“supermax” prisons that use bare minimum treatment and 
23-hours-a-day lockdown. Certainly such a harsh regimen 
should deter future criminality. But a recent study in the 
state of Washington showed that upon release supermax 
prisoners had significantly higher felony recidivism rates 
when compared to a matched sample of traditional in-
mates.187 There are a number of factors that might help ex-
plain why severe punishments promote rather than restrict 
criminality:
Offenders may believe they have learned from their ex-
 
■
periences, and now know how to beat the system and 
get away with crime.188
Severely punished offenders may represent the “worst 
 
■
of the worst,” who will offend again no matter what 
punishments they experience.189
Punishment may bring defi ance rather than deterrence. 
 
■
People who are harshly treated may want to show that 
they cannot be broken by the system. Punishment 
might be perceived to be capricious, unjust, or unfair, 
which causes sanctioned offenders to commit additional 
crimes as a way to lash out and retaliate.
Harsh treatment labels and stigmatizes offenders, lock-
 
■
ing them into a criminal career.
Criminals who are punished may also believe that the 
 
■
likelihood of getting caught twice for the same type of 
crime is remote: “Lightning never strikes twice in the 
same spot,” they may reason; no one is that unlucky.190
The Domestic Violence Studies 
While these results are not encouraging, there are research 
studies that show that arrest and conviction may under some 
circumstances lower the frequency of reoffending, a find-
ing that supports specifi c deterrence.191 The most famous of 
these involve arrest and punishment for domestic violence.

interrelated.197 Economist Steven Levitt concludes that each 
person put behind bars results in a decrease of 15 serious 
crimes per year. He argues that the social benefi ts associated 
with crime reduction equal or exceed the social and fi nan-
cial costs of incarceration.198
Chapter 2 discussed the factors that control crime rates. 
What appears to be an incapacitation effect may actu-
ally reflect the effect of some other legal phenomena 
and not the incarceration of so many criminals. If, for 
example, the crime rate drops as more people are sent 
to prison, it would appear that incapacitation works. 
However, crime rates may really be dropping because 
potential criminals now fear punishment and are being 
deterred from crime. What appears to be an incapacita-
tion effect may actually be an effect of general deter-
rence. Similarly, people may be willing to build new 
prisons because the economy is robust. If the crime rate 
drops, it may be because of economic effects and not 
because of prison construction.
CONNECTIONS
INCAPACITATION
It stands to reason that if more criminals are sent to prison, 
the crime rate should go down. Because most people age out 
of crime, the duration of a criminal career is limited. Plac-
ing offenders behind bars during their prime crime years 
should lessen their lifetime opportunity to commit crime. 
The shorter the span of opportunity, the fewer offenses they 
can commit during their lives; hence crime is reduced. This 
theory, known as the incapacitation effect, seems logical, 
but does it work? The most recent data indicate that na-
tionwide more than 1.6 million are in prison and that the 
inmate population has nearly tripled in 30 years; another 
700,000 people are in local jails. Because the number of 
American adults is about 230 million, this means that one 
in every 100 adults is behind bars.195 Advocates of inca-
pacitation suggest that this growth in the prison/jail popu-
lation is directly responsible for the decade-long decline in 
the crime rate: by putting dangerous felons under lock and 
key for longer periods of time, the opportunity they have 
to commit crime is signifi cantly reduced and so too is the 
crime rate.
Belief that a strict incarceration policy can shape crimi-
nal choice and reduce crime rates has encouraged states to 
adopt tough sentencing laws such as the 
“three strikes and you’re out” policy. This 
sentencing model mandates that people 
convicted of three felony offenses serve a 
mandatory life term without parole. Many 
states already employ habitual offender 
laws that provide long (or life) sentences 
for repeat offenders. Three strikes support-
ers credit the law for a signifi cant drop in 
California’s crime rate, among the sharpest 
decline in any state. At least 2 million fewer 
criminal incidents have occurred, includ-
ing 6,700 fewer homicides, since the state’s 
three strikes law took effect.196
Does Incarceration 
Control Crime? 
The fact that crime rates have dropped while 
the prison population has boomed supports 
incapacitation as an effective crime control 
policy. This assumption seems logical con-
sidering how much crime chronic offenders 
commit each year and the fact that crimi-
nal opportunities are ended once they are 
behind bars. While it is diffi cult to measure 
precisely, there is at least some evidence 
that crime rates and incarceration rates are

District Court on July 18, 2002. Leahy was arraigned on charges including murder,

Newport, Rhode Island, which took place at a rest stop on Route 24 in Bridgewater, 
Massachusetts. Leahy, a repeat sex offender, was found guilty of first-degree murder on 
September 24, 2003, and sentenced to life without parole. Should repeat sex offenders 
be incapacitated for life before their behavior spirals out of control? Or can everyone be 
rehabilitated if given proper treatment?

institutions, and create community disorganization. 
Rather than act as a crime suppressant, incarceration may 
have the long-term effect of accelerating crime rates.203
Three Strikes Laws So while on an individual level there 
is evidence that a stay in prison can reduce the length of a 
criminal career, there is some question whether increasing 
the size of the prison population can have a dramatic effect 
on crime rates.204 Take the “three strikes and you’re out” 
laws, which require the state courts to hand down manda-
tory periods of incarceration of up to life in prison to per-
sons who have been convicted of a serious criminal offense 
on three or more separate occasions. While a policy of plac-
ing people convicted of a third felony behind bars for life 
is politically compelling, many criminologists believe these 
laws will not work for these reasons:
Most three-time losers are on the verge of aging out of 
 
■
crime, so why waste money by keeping them behind 
bars?
Current sentences for violent crimes are already severe.
 
■
An expanding prison population will drive up already 
 
■
high prison costs.
There would be racial disparity in sentencing.
 
■
Police would be in danger because two-time offenders 
 
■
would violently resist a third arrest knowing they face a 
life sentence.
The prison population probably already contains the 
 
■
highest-frequency criminals.205

IMPLICATIONS 
OF CHOICE THEORY
From the origins of classical theory to the development 
of modern rational choice views, the belief that criminals 
choose to commit crime has influenced the relationships 
among law, punishment, and crime. Although research on 
the core principles of choice theory and deterrence theories 
While Levitt’s argument is persuasive, not all criminolo-
gists buy into the incapacitation effect:
There is little evidence that incapacitating criminals will 
 
■
deter them from future criminality and even more reason 
to believe they may be more inclined to commit crimes 
upon release. The more prior incarceration experiences 
inmates have, the more likely they are to recidivate (and 
return to prison) within 12 months of their release.199
By its nature, the prison experience exposes young, 
 
■
fi rst-time offenders to higher-risk, more experienced 
inmates who can infl uence their lifestyle and help shape 
their attitudes. Novice inmates also run an increased 
risk of becoming infected with AIDS and other health 
hazards, and that exposure reduces their life chances 
after release.200 The short-term crime reduction effect of 
incapacitating criminals is negated if the prison experi-
ence has the long-term effect of escalating frequency of 
criminal behavior upon release.
The economics of crime suggest that if money can be 
 
■
made from criminal activity, there will always be some-
one to take the place of the incarcerated offender. New 
criminals will be recruited and trained, offsetting any 
benefi t accrued by incarceration. Imprisoning estab-
lished offenders may likewise open new opportunities 
for competitors who were suppressed by more expe-
rienced criminals. Incarcerating gang members or or-
ganized crime fi gures may open crime and illegal drug 
markets to new groups and gangs who are even hun-
grier and more aggressive than the gangs they replaced
Most criminal offenses are committed by teens and very 
 
■
young adult offenders who are unlikely to be sent to 
prison for a single felony conviction. Aging criminals 
are already past the age when they are likely to commit 
crime. As a result, a strict incarceration policy may keep 
people in prison beyond the time they are a threat to 
society while a new cohort of high-risk adolescents is 
on the street.201
An incapacitation strategy is terribly expensive. The 
 
■
prison system costs billions of dollars each year. Even 
if incarceration could reduce the crime rate, the costs 
would be enormous. Are U.S. taxpayers willing to 
spend billions more on new prison construction and 
annual maintenance fees? A strict incarceration policy 
would result in a growing number of elderly inmates 
whose maintenance costs, estimated at about $70,000 
per year, are three times higher than those of younger 
inmates. Estimates are that about 16 percent of the 
prison population is over age 50.202
Relying on incapacitation as a crime control mechanism 
 
■
has resulted in an ever-expanding prison population. 
Eventually most inmates return to society in a process 
referred to as reentry. In most states, prison inmates, es-
pecially those convicted of drug crimes, have come from 
comparatively few urban inner-city areas. Their return 
may contribute to family disruption, undermine social

mandatory criminal sentences to control violent crime and 
drug traffi cking.
Despite the ongoing debate about its deterrent effect, 
some advocates argue that the death penalty can effectively 
restrict criminality; at least it ensures that convicted crimi-
nals never again get the opportunity to kill. Many observers 
are dismayed because people who are convicted of murder 
sometimes kill again when released on parole. One study of 
52,000 incarcerated murderers found that 810 had been pre-
viously convicted of murder and had killed 821 people fol-
lowing their previous release from prison.206 About 9 percent 
of all inmates on death row have had prior convictions for ho-
micide. Death penalty advocates argue that if these criminals 
had been executed for their fi rst offenses, hundreds of people 
would be alive today.207 And the recent evidence indicating 
that if used a lot capital punishment can reduce a state’s mur-
der rate has encouraged some members of the moral and le-
gal community to suggest that capital punishment is justifi ed 
because it is a life-saving social policy. Writing in the Stanford 
Law Review, Cass Sunstein and Adrian Vermeule conclude 
that “a government that settles upon a package of crime-con-
trol policies that does not include capital punishment might 
well seem, at least prima facie, to be both violating the rights 
and reducing the welfare of its citizens—just as would a state 
that failed to enact simple environmental measures promis-
ing to save a great many lives.”208
Just Desert
The concept of criminal choice has also prompted the cre-
ation of justice policies referred to as just desert. The just 
desert position has been most clearly spelled out by crim-
inologist Andrew Von Hirsch in his book Doing Justice.209 
Von Hirsch suggests the concept of desert as a theoretical 
model to guide justice policy. This utilitarian view purports 
that punishment is needed to preserve the social equity 
disturbed by crime. Nonetheless, he claims, the severity of 
punishment should be commensurate with the seriousness 
of the crime.210 Von Hirsch’s views can be summarized in 
these three statements:
 1. Those who violate others’ rights deserve to be punished.
 2. We should not deliberately add to human suffering; 
punishment makes those punished suffer.
 3. However, punishment may prevent more misery than it 
infl icts; this conclusion reestablishes the need for desert-
based punishment.211
Desert theory is also concerned with the rights of the 
accused. It alleges that the rights of the person being pun-
ished should not be unduly sacrifi ced for the good of others 
(as with deterrence). The offender should not be treated as 
more (or less) blameworthy than is warranted by the char-
acter of his or her offense. For example, Von Hirsch asks 
the following question: if two crimes, A and B, are equally 
serious, but if severe penalties are shown to have a deterrent 
produces mixed results, these models have had an impor-
tant impact on crime prevention strategies.
When police patrol in well-marked cars, it is assumed 
that their presence will deter would-be criminals. When 
the harsh realities of prison life are portrayed in movies and 
TV shows, the lesson is not lost on potential criminals. No-
where is the idea that the threat of punishment can control 
crime more evident than in the implementation of tough 
CONCEPT SUMMARY 4.1
Crime Control Strategies Based 
on Rational Choice
Situational Crime Prevention
This strategy is aimed at convincing would-be criminals to 
 
■
avoid specific targets. It relies on the doctrine that crime 
can be avoided if motivated offenders are denied access to 
suitable targets.
Operationalizations of this strategy are home security 
 
■
systems or guards, which broadcast the message that 
guardianship is great here, stay away; the potential reward is 
not worth the risk of apprehension.
Problems with the strategy are the extinction of the effect 
 
■
and displacement of crime.
General Deterrence Strategies
These strategies are aimed at making potential criminals 
 
■
fear the consequences of crime. The threat of punishment is 
meant to convince rational criminals that crime does not pay.
Operationalizations of these strategies are the death penalty, 
 
■
mandatory sentences, and aggressive policing.
Problems with these strategies are that criminals do not fear 
 
■
punishment and the certainty of arrest and punishment is low.
Specific Deterrence Strategy
This strategy refers to punishing known criminals so severely 
 
■
that they will never be tempted to repeat their offenses. If 
crime is rational, then painful punishment should reduce its 
future allure.
Operationalizations of this strategy are harsh prisons and 
 
■
stiff fines.
A problem with this strategy is that punishment may 
 
■
increase reoffending rates rather than deter crime.
Incapacitation Strategies
These strategies attempt to reduce crime rates by denying 
 
■
motivated offenders the opportunity to commit crime. If, 
despite the threat of law and punishment, some people 
still find crime attractive, then the only way to control their 
behavior is to incarcerate them for extended periods.
Operationalizations of these strategies are long prison 
 
■
sentences, placing more people behind bars.
A problems with these strategies is that people are kept 
 
■
in prison beyond the years they may commit crime. Minor, 
nondangerous offenders are also locked up, and this is a very 
costly strategy.

He claims that prisons don’t work because they 
are too lenient. He proposes ending hot meals, 
education programs, counseling, and phone 
privileges. Television and other recreation would 
be curtailed, as well as visitation. His reasoning 
is that if prison was just an awful experience, 
few inmates would risk returning and therefore would be

or aggravate culpability); and, for multidefendant crimes, 
the defendant’s role in the offense as instigator, leader, fol-
lower, primary actor, or minor player.212 According to Frase, 
fairness is brought to the justice process by assessing blame 
in a fair and even-handed manner: fairness to the victim 
and the victim’s family (i.e., otherwise they might seek ven-
geance on their own), fairness to law-abiding persons (who 
refrained from committing this offense), and fairness to the 
defendant (who has a right to be punished in proportion to 
his blameworthiness).
In sum, the just desert model suggests that retribution 
justifi es punishment because people deserve what they get for 
past deeds. Punishment based on deterrence or incapacita-
tion is wrong because it involves an offender’s future actions, 
which cannot accurately be predicted. Punishment should be 
the same for all people who commit the same crime. Crimi-
nal sentences based on individual needs or characteristics are 
inherently unfair because all people are equally blameworthy 
for their misdeeds. The infl uence of Von Hirsch’s views can 
be seen in sentencing models that give the same punishment 
to all people who commit the same type of crime.
effect only with respect to A, would it be fair to punish the 
person who has committed crime A more harshly simply 
to deter others from committing the crime? Conversely, im-
posing a light sentence for a serious crime would be unfair 
because it would treat the offender as less blameworthy than 
he or she is.
If deterrence is not a proper basis, then how do we de-
termine how much punishment is fitting for a particular 
crime? In other words, how do we assess blame? According 
to legal scholar Richard Frase, two basic elements determine 
an offender’s degree of blameworthiness: the nature and 
seriousness of the harm caused or threatened by the crime 
and the offender’s degree of fault in committing the crime. 
In contemporary society, fault is measured by a number of 
factors: the offender’s intent (e.g., deliberate wrongdoing is 
considered more serious than criminal negligence); his or 
her capacity to obey the law (e.g., blameworthiness is tem-
pered by such conditions as mental disease or defect, chem-
ical dependency, or situational factors such as threats or 
other strong inducements to commit the crime); the offend-
er’s motives for committing the crime (which may mitigate

 1. Describe the development of 
 rational choice theory
Rational choice theory has its 
 
■
roots in the classical school of 
criminology developed by the 
eighteenth-century Italian social 
thinker Cesare Beccaria. James 
Q. Wilson observed that people 
who are likely to commit crime 
are unafraid of breaking the 
law because they value the ex-
citement and thrills of crime, 
have a low stake in conformity, 
and are willing to take greater 
chances than the average 
person.
 2. Describe the concepts of ratio-
nal choice
Law-violating behavior is the 
 
■
product of careful thought and 
planning. People who commit 
crime believe that the rewards 
of crime outweigh the risks. If 
they think they are likely to get 
arrested and punished, people 
will not risk criminal activi-
ties. Before choosing to commit 
a crime, reasoning criminals 
carefully select targets, and

selective. Rational choice theo-
rists view crime as both offense- 
and offender-specifi c.
 3. Discuss how offenders structure 
criminality
Criminals consider their needs 
 
■
and capabilities before commit-
ting crimes. One important deci-
sion that is made before someone 
enters a life of crime is the need 
for money. Personal experience 
may be an important element in 
structuring criminality. Before 
committing crimes, criminals 
report, they actually learn tech-
niques to help them avoid detec-
tion while making profi ts.
 4. Describe how criminals struc-
ture crime
Criminals carefully choose 
 
■
where they will commit their 
crime. Evidence of rational 
choice may be found in the way 
criminals locate their targets. 
Rational choice involves both 
shaping criminality and struc-
turing crime. If a target appears 
dangerous, they will choose 
another.
 5. Develop knowledge showing 
that crime is rational
There is evidence that theft-
 
■
related crimes are the product 
of careful risk assessment, in-
cluding environmental, social, 
and structural factors. Target 
selection seems highly rational. 
Even drug use is controlled by 
rational decision making. Users 
report that they begin taking 
drugs when they believe the 
benefi ts of substance abuse out-
weigh its costs. Evidence con-
fi rms that even violent criminals 
select suitable targets by picking 
people who are vulnerable and 
lack adequate defenses. In some 
instances, targets are chosen in 
order to send a message rather 
than to generate capital.
 6. Know what is meant by the 
term seductions of crime
In his book 
 
■
Seductions of Crime, 
Jack Katz argues that there are 
immediate benefi ts to criminal-
ity. According to Katz, choosing 
crime can help satisfy personal 
needs. Katz fi nds that crimes 
can help soothe the strain pro-
duced by emotional upheaval. 
People are most likely to be 
“seduced” if they fear neither 
the risk of apprehension nor its 
social consequences.
 7. Discuss the elements of situa-
tional crime prevention
Situational crime prevention 
 
■
involves developing tactics to 
reduce or eliminate a specifi c 
crime problem. These include 
tactics to increase the effort re-
quired to commit crime, such 
as putting unbreakable glass 
on storefronts, locking gates, 
and fencing yards. It can also 
involve increasing the risks of 
crime through better security 
efforts. Reducing the rewards 
of crime is designed to lessen 
the value of crime to the po-
tential criminal. Crime may 
be reduced or prevented if we 
can communicate to people the 
wrongfulness of their behavior 
and how it is harmful to soci-
ety. Crime may be reduced by 
making it diffi cult for people to 
excuse their criminal behavior 
by saying things like “I didn’t 
know that was illegal” or “I had 
no choice.”
 8. Be familiar with the elements of 
general deterrence
Crime can be controlled by 
 
■
increasing the real or perceived 
threat of criminal punishment. 
According to deterrence theory, 
not only does the actual chance 
of punishment infl uence crimi-
nality, so too does the percep-
tion of punishment. A central 
theme of deterrence theory is 
that people who perceive they 
will be punished for crimes will 
avoid doing those crimes. Ac-
cording to general deterrence 
theory, if the certainty of arrest, 
conviction, and sanctioning 
increases, crime rates should 
decline. The threat of severe 
punishment should also bring 
the crime rate down. The faster 
punishment is applied and the 
more closely it is linked to the 
crime, the more likely it will 
serve as a deterrent. The factors 
of severity, certainty, and speed 
of punishment may also infl u-
ence one another.
 9. Discuss the basic concepts of 
specifi c deterrence
The theory of specifi c deter-
 
■
rence holds that criminal sanc-
tions should be so powerful 
that known criminals will never 
repeat their criminal acts. Re-
search on specifi c deterrence 
does not provide any clear-cut 
evidence that punishing crimi-
nals is an effective means of 
stopping them from commit-
ting future crimes. Punishment 
may bring defi ance rather than 
deterrence. People who are 
harshly treated may want to 
show that they cannot be bro-
ken by the system. The stigma 
of harsh treatment labels people 
and helps lock offenders into a 
criminal career instead of con-
vincing them to avoid one.
 10. Understand the pros and cons 
of an incapacitation strategy to 
reduce crime
The more criminals are sent 
 
■
to prison, the more the crime 
rate should go down. Placing 
offenders behind bars dur-
ing their prime crime years 
should reduce their lifetime 
opportunity to commit crime. 
The shorter the span of oppor-
tunity, the fewer offenses they 
can commit during their lives; 
hence, crime is reduced. How-
ever, there is little evidence that 
incapacitating criminals will 
deter them from future crimi-
nality and reason to believe 
they may be more inclined to 
commit even more crimes upon 
release.

 1. Are criminals rational decision 
makers, or are they motivated by 
uncontrollable psychological and 
emotional drives?
 2. Would you want to live in a soci-
ety where crime rates are low be-
cause criminals are subjected to 
extremely harsh punishments, 
such as fl ogging for vandalism?
 3. If you were caught by the police 
while shoplifting, which would 
you be more afraid of: receiving 
criminal punishment or having to 
face your friends or relatives?
 4. Is it possible to create a method 
of capital punishment that would 
actually deter murder—for exam-
ple, by televising executions? 
What might be some of the nega-
tive consequences of such a 
policy?

ON
On Monday, April 16, 2007, 23-year-old Seung-Hui Cho methodically took the lives of 32 people—27 
students and 5 professors—at Virginia Tech before taking his own life.1 In the aftermath of the tragedy, Cho 
was described as a loner unable to make social connections. He had been involuntarily institutionalized in 
a mental health facility. He became fi xated on several female students who eventually complained to the 
police because he was showing up at their rooms and bombarding them with instant messages.2 In a creative 
writing class, he read one of his poems in class, and its sinister content so frightened classmates that some 
did not show up the next time the class met.3 Ten months later, on February 14, 2008, another tragedy 
occurred at Northern Illinois University. Steven Kazmierczak, a former student, who was currently enrolled 
in the school of social work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, entered Cole Hall, a large

140  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
S
that we respond to a particularly horrible crime by saying 
of the perpetrator, “That guy must be crazy” or “She is a 
monster!”
The view that criminals bear physical and/or mental 
traits that make them different and abnormal is not re-
stricted to the movie going public. Since the nineteenth 
century, criminologists have suggested that biological and 
psychological traits have the power to infl uence behavior. 
People develop physical or mental traits at birth or soon af-
ter that affect their social functioning over the life course 
and infl uence their behavior choices. Because these mental 
and physical traits are rare and occur infrequently, only a 
few people in any social environment embark on criminal 
careers. As you may recall, only a small percentage of all of-
fenders go on to become persistent repeaters. It makes logi-
cal sense that what sets these chronic offenders apart from 
the “average” criminal is an abnormal biochemical makeup, 
brain structure, genetic constitution, or some other personal 
trait.5 The fact that each of us has a unique physical makeup 
and personality structure explains why, when faced with the 
same life situations, one person commits crime and becomes 
a chronic offender, whereas another attends school, church, 
and neighborhood functions and obeys the laws of society.
To understand this view of crime causation, we begin 
with a brief review of the development of trait theories.
FOUNDATIONS 
OF TRAIT THEORY
During the late nineteenth century, the scientifi c method 
was beginning to take hold in Europe. Rather than relying 
on pure thought and reason, scientists began to use care-
ful observation and analysis of natural phenomena in their 
experiments. This movement inspired new discoveries 
in biology, astronomy, and chemistry. Charles Darwin’s 
(1809–1882) discoveries on the evolution of man encouraged 
Senseless tragedies such as these help convince some crimi-
nologists that the root cause of crime may be linked to men-
tal or physical abnormality. How could young men such as 
Cho, Loughner, and Kazmierczak engage in mass murder 
unless they were suffering from some form of mental in-
stability or collapse? In the aftermath of the killings, there 
seemed to be ample evidence that all three were under se-
vere psychological stress, yet no one was able to foresee or 
predict their violent actions.
This vision is neither new nor unique. The image of a 
disturbed, mentally ill offender seems plausible because 
more than one generation of Americans has grown up on 
fi lms and TV shows that portray violent criminals as men-
tally deranged and physically abnormal. Beginning with 
Alfred Hitchcock’s fi lm Psycho, producers have made mil-
lions depicting the ghoulish acts of people who at fi rst seem 
normal and even friendly but turn out to be demented and 
dangerous. Lurking out there are fanatical patients (Saw I
through Saw VI, plus Saw 3D), crazed babysitters (The Hand 
that Rocks the Cradle), frenzied airline passengers (Red Eye; 
Turbulence), deranged roommates (Single White Female), 
cracked neighbors (Disturbia; Last House on the Left), psy-
chotic tenants (Pacifi c Heights), demented secretaries (The 
Temp), unhinged police (Maniac Cop), mad cab drivers (The 
Bone Collector), irrational fans (The Fan; Misery), abnormal 
girlfriends (Obsessed; Fatal Attraction) and boyfriends (Fear), 
unstable husbands (Enough; Sleeping with the Enemy) and 
wives (Black Widow), loony fathers (The Stepfather), moth-
ers (Friday the 13th, Part 1), and grandmothers (Hush), un-
balanced crime victims (I Know What You Did Last Summer), 
maniacal children (The Good Son; Children of the Corn), manic 
hotel owners (Psycho; Hostel and Hostel: Part II), lunatic high 
school friends (Scream) and college classmates (Scream II), 
possessed dolls (Child’s Play 1–3) and their mates (Bride of 
Chucky), and nutsy teenaged admirers (The Crush). Some-
times they even try to kill each other (Freddy vs. Jason), and 
some are not even totally human (Twilight; I Am Legend). 
No one can ever be safe when doctors, psychologists, and 
psychiatrists who should be treating these disturbed people 
turn out to be demonic murderers themselves (The Human 
Centipede; Hannibal; Silence of the Lambs). Is it any wonder 
auditorium-style lecture hall on the NIU campus, armed with a shotgun and three handguns. Standing on 
the stage, he methodically began shooting into the crowded classroom, killing 5 and wounding 16 others 
before taking his own life. In the aftermath of the incident, Kazmierczak was described as “an outstanding 
student” who suffered from depression and anxiety. His girlfriend, Jessica Baty, later said, “He was anything 
but a monster,” Baty said. “He was probably the nicest, most caring person ever.”4 In a more recent tragedy, 
on January 8, 2011, Jared Lee Loughner opened fi re in a supermarket parking lot in Tucson, Arizona, killing 
6 and wounding 19 in a misguided attempt to assassinate Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.

psychological, such as an individual’s brain structure and 
his or her biological makeup or mental ability. Each of these 
infl uences and shapes human behavior. People are neither 
born “good” nor “bad,” and are neither “saints” nor “sin-
ners.” They are a product of their social and psychological 
traits, infl uenced by their upbringing and environment.
Biological Positivism
The earliest “scientifi c” studies applying the positivist model 
to criminology were conducted by physiognomists, such as 
J. K. Lavater (1741–1801), who studied the facial features of 
criminals to determine whether the shape of ears, nose, and 
eyes and the distance between them were associated with 
antisocial behavior. Phrenologists, such as Franz Joseph 
Gall (1758–1828) and Johann K. Spurzheim (1776–1832), 
studied the shape of the skull and bumps on the head to 
determine whether these physical attributes were linked 
to criminal behavior. Phrenologists believed that external 
cranial characteristics dictate which areas of the brain con-
trol physical activity. The brain, they suggested, has 30 dif-
ferent areas or faculties that control behavior. The size of 
a brain could be determined by inspecting the contours of 
the skull—the larger the organ, the more active it was. The 
relative size of brain organs could be increased or decreased 
through exercise and self-discipline.6 Though phrenology 
techniques and methods are no longer practiced or taken 
seriously, these efforts were an early attempt to use a “scien-
tifi c” method to study crime.
By the early nineteenth century, abnormality in the hu-
man mind was being linked to criminal behavior patterns.7 
Philippe Pinel (1745–1826), one of the founders of French 
psychiatry, claimed that some people behave abnormally 
even without being mentally ill. He coined the phrase manie 
sans delire to denote what today is referred to as a psycho-
pathic personality. In 1812, an American, Benjamin Rush 
(1745–1813), described patients with an “innate preternat-
ural moral depravity.”8 Another early criminological pioneer, 
English physician Henry Maudsley (1835–1918), believed 
that insanity and criminal behavior were strongly linked. 
He stated: “Crime is a sort of outlet in which their unsound 
tendencies are discharged; they would go mad if they were 
not criminals, and they do not go mad because they are 
criminals.”9 These early research efforts shifted attention to 
brain functioning and personality as the keys to criminal be-
havior. When Sigmund Freud’s (1856–1939) work on the 
unconscious gained worldwide notoriety, the psychological 
basis of behavior was forever established.
Cesare Lombroso
In Italy, Cesare Lombroso (1835–1909), a physician who 
served much of his career in the Italian army, was studying 
the cadavers of executed criminals in an effort to scientifi cally 
a nineteenth-century “cult of science.” Darwin’s discoveries 
encouraged other scholars to be certain that all human activ-
ity could be verifi ed by scientifi c principles. If the scientifi c 
method could be applied to the study of the natural world, 
then why not use it to study human behavior?
Auguste Comte (1798–1857), considered the founder of 
sociology, applied scientifi c methods to the study of society. 
According to Comte, societies pass through stages that can 
be grouped on the basis of how people try to understand the 
world in which they live. People in primitive societies con-
sider inanimate objects as having life (for example, the sun 
is a god); in later social stages, people embrace a rational, 
scientifi c view of the world. Comte called this fi nal stage the 
positive stage, and those who followed his writings became 
known as positivists. As we understand it today, positivism 
has two main elements:
All true knowledge is acquired through direct observa-
 
■
tion and not through conjecture or belief. Statements 
that cannot be backed up by direct observation—for 
instance, “all babies are born innocent”—are invalid 
and worthless.
The scientifi c method must be used if research fi ndings 
 
■
are to be considered valid. This involves such steps as 
identifying problems, collecting data, forming hypoth-
eses, conducting experiments, and interpreting results 
(see Exhibit 5.1).
According to the positivist tradition, social processes are 
a product of the measurable interaction between relation-
ships and events. Human behavior therefore is a function 
of a variety of forces. Some are social, such as the effect of 
wealth and class; others are political and historical, such 
as war and famine. Other forces are more personal and

unlikely to commit violent crime and more willing to 
engage in less strenuous criminal activities such as fenc-
ing stolen property.
Ectomorphs 
 
■
are tall, thin, and less social and more intel-
lectual than the other types. These types are the least 
likely to commit crime.17
Sheldon recognized that pure types are rare and that 
most people have elements of all three types. He identifi ed 
a Dionysian temperament, a person who has an excess of 
mesomorphy with a deficiency in ectomorphic restraint, 
thereby rendering them impulsive and into self-gratifi cation, 
a condition that would produce crime.
The Legacy of Biological Criminology
The work of Lombroso and his contemporaries is regarded 
today as a historical curiosity, not scientifi c fact. Strict bio-
logical determinism is no longer taken seriously (later in his 
career even Lombroso recognized that not all criminals were 
biological throwbacks). Early biological determinism has been 
discredited because it is methodologically fl awed; most stud-
ies did not use control groups from the general population to 
compare results, a violation of the scientifi c method. Many 
of the traits assumed to be inherited are not really genetically 
determined but could be caused by deprivation in surround-
ings and diet. Even if most criminals shared some biological 
traits, they might be products not of heredity but of some en-
vironmental condition, such as poor nutrition or health care. 
Unusual appearance, and not behavior, may have prompted 
people to be labeled and punished by the justice system.
Because of these deficiencies the validity of a purely 
biological/psychological explanation of criminality became 
questionable and is no longer considered valid. Today, 
criminologists believe that environmental conditions inter-
act with human traits and conditions to infl uence behavior. 
Hence, the term biosocial theory has been coined to refl ect 
the assumed link between physical and mental traits, the so-
cial environment, and behavior.
Sociobiology
What seems no longer tenable at this juncture is any 
theory of human behavior which ignores biology and 
relies exclusively on socio-cultural learning. . . . Most 
social scientists have been wrong in their dogmatic 
rejection and blissful ignorance of the biological param-
eters of our behavior.18
At midcentury, sociology dominated the study of crime and 
scholarship and any suggestion that antisocial behavior may 
have an individual-level cause was treated with enmity.19 
Some criminologists label this position as biophobia, the 
view that no serious consideration should be given to biologi-
cal factors when attempting to understand human nature.20
determine whether law violators were physically different 
from people of conventional values and behavior.10 Lom-
broso believed that serious offenders—those who engaged 
in repeated assault- or theft-related activities—were “born 
criminals” who had inherited a set of primitive physical traits 
that he referred to as atavistic anomalies. Physically, born 
criminals were throwbacks to more primitive savage people. 
Among the crime-producing traits Lombroso identifi ed were 
enormous jaws and strong canine teeth common to carni-
vores and savages who devour raw fl esh. These criminogenic 
traits can be acquired through indirect heredity, from a degen-
erate family whose members suffered from such ills as in-
sanity, syphilis, and alcoholism, or direct heredity—being the 
offspring of criminal parents.
Lombroso’s version of criminal anthropology was 
brought to the United States via articles and textbooks that 
adopted his ideas. He attracted a circle of followers who ex-
panded on his vision of biological determinism and helped 
stimulate interest in what is referred to as criminal anthro-
pology.11 Ironically, Lombroso’s research was more popular 
in the United States than it was in Europe, and by the turn 
of the century, American social thinkers were discussing “the 
science of penology” and “the science of criminology.”12
Lombroso’s Contemporaries Lombroso was not alone in 
his views on the biological basis of crime. A contemporary, 
Raffaele Garofalo (1852–1934), shared the belief that certain 
physical characteristics indicate a criminal nature: “a lower 
degree of sensibility to physical pain, seems to be demon-
strated by the readiness with which prisoners submit to the 
operation of tattooing.”13 Enrico Ferri (1856–1929) added a 
social dimension to Lombroso’s work and argued that crimi-
nals should not be held personally or morally responsible 
for their actions because forces outside their control caused 
criminality.14
Advocates of the inheritance school, such as Henry 
Goddard, Richard Dugdale, and Arthur Estabrook, traced 
several generations of crime-prone families (referred to by 
pseudonyms such as the “Jukes” and the “Kallikaks”), fi nd-
ing evidence that criminal tendencies were based on genet-
ics.15 Their conclusion: traits deemed socially inferior could 
be passed down from generation to generation through 
inheritance. Modern scholars point out that these families 
lived in severe poverty so that social rather than biological 
factors may have been at the root of their problems.16
The body build or somatotype school, developed more 
than 50 years ago by William Sheldon, held that criminals 
manifest distinct physiques that make them susceptible to 
particular types of antisocial behavior. Three types of body 
builds were identifi ed:
Mesomorphs 
 
■
have well-developed muscles and an ath-
letic appearance. They are active, aggressive, sometimes 
violent, and the most likely to become criminals.
Endomorphs 
 
■
have heavy builds and are slow moving. 
They are known for lethargic behavior, rendering them

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  143
and neighborhood conditions. Physical or mental traits are, 
therefore, but one part of a large pool of environmental, so-
cial, and personal factors that account for criminality. Some 
people may have a predisposition toward aggression, but 
environmental stimuli can either suppress or trigger antiso-
cial acts.
Environment, Traits, and Crime Even the most commit-
ted trait theorists recognize that environmental conditions 
in disadvantaged inner-city areas may have a powerful infl u-
ence on antisocial behavior. Many people who reside in these 
areas experience poverty, racism, frustration, and anger, yet 
relatively few become delinquents and even fewer mature 
into adult criminals. Because not all humans are born with 
equal potential to learn and achieve (equipotentiality), the 
combination of physical traits and the environment pro-
duces individual behavior patterns. In fact, what may ap-
pear to some as the effect of environment and socialization 
actually may be linked to genetically determined physical 
and/or mental traits. Psychologist Bernard Rimland, for one, 
argues that while childhood behavior problems are com-
monly linked to poor environment, disrupted socialization, 
or inadequate parenting, they actually stem from an abnor-
mal trait: neurological damage linked to diet and chemical 
contamination. In his 2008 book, Dyslogic Syndrome, Rim-
land disputes the notion that bad or ineffective parenting is 
to blame for troubled or disobedient children:
. . . most “bad” children . . . suffer from toxic physical 
environments, often coupled with genetic vulnerability, 
rather than toxic family environments. . . . research 
clearly shows that the culprits primarily responsible for 
the dyslogical behavior of millions of America’s chil-
dren are not their parents, but rather the poor-quality 
food substitutes they eat, the pollutants in the air they 
breathe, the chemically contaminated water they drink, 
and other less well-known physical insults that cause 
malfunctioning brains and bodies. Many of these chil-
dren are labeled “hyperactive” or “attention disordered.” 
Some are labeled “conduct disordered.” Some are la-
beled “oppositional.” Thousands are labeled “depressed” 
or “bipolar.” And many are simply dismissed as hope-
lessly warped or evil. They struggle at school, they 
struggle through life, and in their wake they leave a trail 
of misery—of disrupted and saddened lives. But it’s not 
truly their fault, and it’s rarely their parents’ fault.22
So according to Rimland and others who share his be-
liefs, it is personal traits and biological makeup in combi-
nation with the social environment that explains behavioral 
choices.23 As criminologists Anthony Walsh and Lee Ellis 
conclude, “If there is one takeaway lesson from studying bi-
ological bases of behavior, it is that the more we study them 
the more we realize how important the environment is.”24
Contemporary trait theories can be divided into two 
major subdivisions: one that stresses psychological func-
tioning and another that stresses biological (biosocial) 
Then in the early 1970s, spurred by the publication of 
Sociobiology, by biologist Edmund O. Wilson, the biologi-
cal basis for crime once again emerged into the limelight.21 
Sociobiology differs from earlier theories of behavior in that 
it stresses that biological and genetic conditions affect how 
social behaviors are learned and perceived. These percep-
tions, in turn, are linked to existing environmental struc-
tures. Sociobiologists view the gene as the ultimate unit of 
life that controls all human destiny. Although they believe 
environment and experience also have an impact on behav-
ior, their main premise is that most actions are controlled by 
a person’s “biological machine.” Most important, people are 
controlled by the innate need to have their genetic material 
survive and dominate others. Consequently, they do every-
thing in their power to ensure their own survival and that of 
others who share their gene pool (relatives, fellow citizens, 
and so forth). Even when they come to the aid of others, 
which is called reciprocal altruism, people are motivated 
by the belief that their actions will be reciprocated and that 
their gene survival capability will be enhanced.
Contemporary Trait Theories
The study of sociobiology revived interest in fi nding a bi-
ological basis for crime and delinquency. If, as it suggests, 
biological (genetic) makeup controls human behavior, it 
follows that it should also be responsible for determining 
whether a person chooses law-violating or conventional be-
havior. This view of crime causation is referred to as trait 
theory.
Trait theorists today do not suggest that a single bio-
logical or psychological attribute is thought to adequately 
explain all criminality. Rather, each offender is considered 
unique, physically and mentally; consequently, there must 
be different explanations for each person’s behavior. Some 
may have inherited criminal tendencies, others may be suf-
fering from nervous system (neurological) problems, and 
still others may have a blood chemistry disorder that height-
ens their antisocial activity. Criminologists who focus on the 
individual see many explanations for crime, because, in fact, 
there are many differences among criminal offenders.
Trait theorists are not overly concerned with legal defi -
nitions of crime; they do not try to explain why people vio-
late particular statutory laws such as car theft or burglary. 
To them, these are artifi cial legal concepts based on arbi-
trary boundaries (i.e., speeding may be arbitrarily defi ned 
as exceeding 65 miles per hour in some areas, 70 in others). 
Instead, trait theorists focus on basic human behavior and 
drives—attachment, aggression, violence, impulsivity—that 
are linked to antisocial behavior patterns. They also recog-
nize that human traits may not alone produce criminality 
and that crime-producing interactions involve both per-
sonal traits—such as intelligence, personality, and chemi-
cal and genetic makeup—and environmental factors, such 
as family life, educational attainment, economic factors,

biosocial theory.25 First, we look at the biochemical factors 
that are believed to affect behavior. Then the relationship of 
brain function and crime will be considered, followed by an 
analysis of genetics and crime. Finally, evolutionary views of 
crime causation are evaluated.
Biochemical Conditions and Crime
Some trait theorists believe biochemical conditions, includ-
ing both those that are genetically predetermined and those 
acquired through diet and environment, control and infl u-
ence antisocial behavior.26 The infl uence of damaging chem-
ical and biological contaminants may begin before birth if 
the mother’s diet either lacks or has an excess of important 
nutrients (such as manganese) that may later cause devel-
opmental problems in her offspring.27 In sum, exposure to 
harmful chemicals and poor diet in utero, at birth, and be-
yond may then affect people throughout their life course. 
Some of the more important biochemical factors that have 
been linked to criminality are set out in detail here.
Smoking and Drinking Maternal alcohol abuse and/or 
smoking during gestation have long been linked to prena-
tal damage and subsequent antisocial behavior in adoles-
cence.28 When Lisa Gatzke-Kopp and Theodore Beauchaine 
examined relations between maternal smoking and child 
behavior, they found that exposure to smoke was associ-
ated with increased psychopathology in offspring and that 
exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke during pregnancy 
predicted later conduct disorder.29 Having a smoking par-
ent had a greater affect on behavior than other infl uences, 
including prematurity, low birth weight, and poor parenting 
practices.
Research now shows that people who start drinking by 
the age of 14 are fi ve times more likely to become alcoholics 
than people who hold off on drinking until the age of 21. It 
is possible that early exposure of the brain to alcohol may 
short-circuit the growth of brain cells, impairing the learn-
ing and memory processes that protect against addiction. 
Thus, early ingestion of alcohol will have a direct infl uence 
on behavior.30
Exposure to Chemicals and Minerals Biosocial criminol-
ogists maintain that minimum levels of minerals and chemi-
cals are needed for normal brain functioning and growth, 
especially in the early years of life. Research conducted 
over the past decade shows that an over- or undersupply 
of certain chemicals and minerals—including sodium, mer-
cury potassium, calcium, amino acids, monoamines, and 
peptides—can lead to depression, mania, cognitive prob-
lems, memory loss, and abnormal sexual activity.31 Com-
mon food additives such as calcium propionate, which is 
used to preserve bread, have been linked to problem behav-
iors.32 Even some commonly used medicines may have det-
rimental side effects. There has been recent research linking 
makeup. Although there is often overlap between these 
views (i.e., brain functioning may have a biological basis), 
each branch has its unique characteristics and will be dis-
cussed separately.
BIOSOCIAL THEORY
Rather than viewing the criminal as a person whose behav-
ior is controlled solely by conditions determined at birth, 
most biocriminologists believe that physical, environmental, 
and social conditions work in concert to produce human 
behavior; this integrated approach is commonly referred to 
as biosocial theory. The following subsections will exam-
ine some of the more important schools of thought within 
Eric Hunt stands in Superior Court in Somerville, New Jersey, accused 
of attacking Nobel laureate and Holocaust scholar Elie Wiesel in San 
Francisco on February 1, 2007. Hunt, a Holocaust denier, was 
convicted and sentenced to two years, but was given credit for time 
served and good behavior; he was released and ordered to undergo 
psychological treatment. Are troubled people like Hunt the “victim” 
of some personal trait or condition that prevents them from 
understanding the wrongfulness of their behavior? Or if they do 
understand, are they able to control their antisocial thoughts?

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  145
Diet can have a long-term infl uence on behavior. Adrian 
Raine and his colleagues charted the long-term effects of a 
two-year diet enrichment program for 3-year-olds in the Af-
rican nation of Mauritania. One hundred randomly selected 
children were placed in the program, which provided them 
with nutritious lunches, physical exercise, and enhanced 
education. They were then compared with a control group 
made up of children who did not participate in the pro-
gram. By age 17, kids who had been malnourished before 
they entered the nutrition program had higher scores on 
physical and psychological well-being than malnourished 
kids who had not been in the program. By age 23, the mal-
nourished kids who had been in the program 20 years ear-
lier still did better on personality tests and had lower levels 
of self-reported crimes than the malnourished children who 
not been placed in the program. Overall, the results showed 
that providing children with nutritious diets and enriched 
environments is associated with greater mental health and 
reduced antisocial activities later in life.42
Sugar Intake One area of diet that has received a great 
deal of attention is the association between high intakes of 
carbohydrates and sugar and antisocial behavior. Experi-
ments have been conducted in which children’s diets were 
altered so that sweet drinks were replaced with fruit juices, 
table sugar with honey, molasses substituted for sugar in 
cooking, and so on; results indicate that these changes can 
reduce aggression levels.43 Although these results are im-
pressive, a number of biologists have questioned this asso-
ciation, and some recent research efforts have failed to fi nd 
a link between sugar consumption and violence.44 In one 
important study, a group of researchers had 25 preschool 
children and 23 school-age children described as sensitive 
to sugar follow a different diet for three consecutive three-
week periods. One diet was high in sucrose, the second 
substituted aspartame (NutraSweet) for a sweetener, and the 
third relied on saccharin. Careful measurement of the sub-
jects found little evidence of cognitive or behavioral differ-
ences that could be linked to diet. If anything, sugar seemed 
to have a calming effect on the children.45
In sum, while some research efforts allege a sugar– 
violence association, others suggest that many people who 
maintain diets high in sugar and carbohydrates are not 
violent or crime prone. In some cases, in fact, sugar in-
take has been found to possibly reduce or curtail violent 
tendencies.46
Glucose Metabolism/Hypoglycemia Research shows 
that persistent abnormality in the way the brain metabolizes 
glucose (sugar) can be linked to antisocial behaviors such 
as substance abuse.47 Hypoglycemia occurs when glucose 
in the blood falls below levels necessary for normal and ef-
fi cient brain functioning. The brain is sensitive to the lack 
of blood sugar because it is the only organ that obtains its 
energy solely from the combustion of carbohydrates. Thus, 
when the brain is deprived of blood sugar, it has no alternate 
sildenafi l, more commonly known as Viagra, with aggres-
sive and violent behavior. While the cause is still unknown, 
it is possible that sildenafi l exerts various biochemical and 
physiologic effects in the brain and that it affects informa-
tion processing.33
Research shows that excessive intake of certain metals 
such as iron and manganese may be linked to neurological 
dysfunctions such as intellectual impairment and attention 
defi cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These neurological 
conditions are believed to be a precursor of delinquent and 
criminal behaviors.34 In a recent international study, Hong 
Kong researchers, D. K. L. Cheuk and Virginia Wong mea-
sured the blood mercury levels of 52 children diagnosed 
with ADHD and compared them to another group of 59 
non-ADHD adolescents. After controlling for numerous per-
sonal and social factors, Cheuk and Wong found that the 
ADHD sample had signifi cantly higher mercury levels than 
controls. While the sample size they used was small, they 
were able to conclude that mercury poisoning, both prena-
tal and after birth, can have a detrimental effect on cognitive 
functions and cause behavioral problems later in life that 
have been associated with crime and delinquency.35
Diet and Crime If biochemical makeup can infl uence be-
havior, then it stands to reason that food intake and diet 
are related to crime.36 Those biocriminologists who believe 
in a diet–aggression association claim that in every segment 
of society there are violent, aggressive, and amoral people 
whose improper food, vitamin, and mineral intake may be 
responsible for their antisocial behavior.37 If diet could be 
improved, they believe, the frequency of violent behavior 
would be reduced.38
In some instances, the absence in the diet of certain 
chemicals and minerals—including sodium, potassium, 
calcium, amino acids, magnesium, monoamines, and pep-
tides—can lead to depression, mania, cognitive problems, 
memory loss, and abnormal sexual activity.39 In contrast, re-
search shows that excessive amounts of harmful substances 
such as food dyes and artifi cial colors and/or fl avors seem to 
provoke hostile, impulsive, and otherwise antisocial behav-
iors.40 Take for instance a study that tested 153 3-year-olds 
and 144 children between the ages of 8 and 9 by exposing 
them to three different drink combinations:
Mix A contained the additives sunset yellow, car-
 
■
moisine, tartrazine, ponceau 4R, and sodium benzoate, 
chemicals typically found in two single-serving bags 
of candy.
Mix B contained sunset yellow, carmoisine, quinoline 
 
■
yellow, allura red, and sodium benzoate equal to what 
is in two to four bags of candy.
There was also a placebo with no additives.
 
■
Using a carefully planned experimental design, the re-
searchers found that Mix A markedly worsened the younger 
children’s hyperactivity scores, and that both Mix A and Mix 
B affected older children adversely.41

Hormonal differences may be a key to understanding 
gender differences in the crime rate. Females may be bio-
logically protected from deviant behavior in the same way 
they are immune from some diseases that strike males.60 
Girls who have high levels of testosterone or are exposed to 
testosterone in utero may become more aggressive in adoles-
cence.61 Conversely, boys who were prenatally exposed to 
steroids that decrease androgen levels display decreased ag-
gressiveness in adolescence. Gender differences in the crime 
rate then may be explained by the relative difference in an-
drogens between the two sexes.
Hormonal changes may also be able to explain regional 
and temporal differences in the crime rate. We know that 
violent crime rates vary from month to month in a sea-
sonal pattern peaking in the summer, and that crime rates 
are higher in the warmer West and South regions than the 
cooler Northeast and Midwest. Evidence also shows that 
impulsive work-related behavior such as strikes and quit-
ting jobs are more likely to occur during the summer. How 
can these phenomena be explained? It is possible they are 
due to the side effects of stress hormones such as adrenaline, 
which the body generates to cope with thermal heat stress. 
As heat rises, people get irritable, and the body produces ex-
cess hormones, which are directly related to aggression and 
antisocial behaviors.62
How Hormones Influence Behavior Hormones cause ar-
eas of the brain to become less sensitive to environmental 
stimuli. High androgen levels require people to seek excess 
stimulation and to be willing to tolerate pain in their quest 
for thrills. Androgens are linked to brain seizures that, un-
der stressful conditions, can result in emotional volatility. 
Androgens affect the brain structure itself. They infl uence 
the left hemisphere of the neocortex, the part of the brain 
that controls sympathetic feelings toward others.63 Here are 
some of the physical reactions produced by hormones that 
have been linked to violence:
A lowering of average resting arousal under normal en-
 
■
vironmental conditions to a point where individuals are 
motivated to seek unusually high levels of environmen-
tal stimulation and are less sensitive to harmful after-
effects resulting from this stimulation
A lowering of seizure thresholds in and around the 
 
■
limbic system, increasing the likelihood that stressful 
environmental factors will trigger strong and impulsive 
emotional responses
A rightward shift in neocortical functioning, resulting 
 
■
in an increased reliance on the brain hemisphere that 
is most closely integrated with the limbic system and 
is least prone to reason in logical-linguistic forms or to 
respond to linguistic commands64
These effects promote violence and other serious crimes 
by causing people to seek greater levels of environmental 
 stimulation and to tolerate more punishment, increasing 
impulsivity, emotional volatility, and antisocial emotions.65
food supply to call upon, and brain metabolism slows down, 
impairing function. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include ir-
ritability, anxiety, depression, crying spells, headaches, and 
confusion.
Research studies have linked hypoglycemia to outbursts 
of antisocial behavior and violence.48 Several studies have 
related assaults and fatal sexual offenses to hypoglycemic 
reactions.49 Hypoglycemia has also been connected with 
a syndrome characterized by aggressive and assaultive be-
havior, glucose disturbance, and brain dysfunction. Some 
attempts have been made to measure hypoglycemia using 
subjects with a known history of criminal activity. Studies of 
jail and prison inmate populations have found a higher than 
normal level of hypoglycemia.50 High levels of reactive hy-
poglycemia have been found in groups of habitually violent 
and impulsive offenders.51
Hormonal Influences Criminologist James Q. Wilson, 
in his book The Moral Sense, concludes that hormones, 
enzymes, and neurotransmitters may be the keys to un-
derstanding human behavior. According to Wilson, they 
help explain gender differences in the crime rate. Males, he 
writes, are biologically and naturally more aggressive than 
females, while women are naturally more nurturing due 
to the fact they are the ones who bear and raise children.52 
Hormone levels also help explain the aging-out process. 
Levels of testosterone, the principal male steroid hormone, 
decline during the life cycle and may explain why violence 
rates diminish over time.53
A number of biosocial theorists are now evaluating the 
association between violent behavior episodes and hor-
mone levels, and the fi ndings suggest that abnormal lev-
els of male sex hormones (androgens) do in fact produce 
aggressive behavior.54 In particular, one recent study by 
Lee Ellis and his associates found that self-reported violent 
criminality was positively correlated with masculine man-
nerisms, masculine body appearance, physical strength, 
strength of sex drive, low/deep voice, upper body strength, 
lower body strength, and amount of body hair.55 Other 
androgen-related male traits include sensation seeking, im-
pulsivity, dominance, and lesser verbal skills; all of these 
androgen-related male traits are related to antisocial be-
haviors.56 There is a growing body of evidence suggesting 
that hormonal changes are also related to mood and behav-
ior and, concomitantly, that adolescents experience more 
intense mood swings, anxiety, and restlessness than their 
elders.57 An association between hormonal activity and an-
tisocial behavior is suggested because rates of both factors 
peak in adolescence.58
One area of concern has been testosterone, the most 
abundant androgen, which controls secondary sex char-
acteristics, such as facial hair and voice timbre. Excessive 
levels of testosterone have been linked to violence and ag-
gression.59 Studies of prisoners show that testosterone levels 
are higher in men who commit violent crimes than in the 
general population.

emotional, and behavioral problems. Research indicates a 
connection between allergies and hyperemotionality, de-
pression, aggressiveness, and violent behavior.77
Neuroallergy and cerebral allergy problems have also 
been linked to hyperactivity in children, a condition also 
linked to antisocial behavior. The foods most commonly 
involved in producing such allergies are cow’s milk, wheat, 
corn, chocolate, citrus, and eggs; however, about 300 other 
foods have been identifi ed as allergens. The potential seri-
ousness of the problem has been raised by studies linking 
the average consumption of one suspected cerebral allergen, 
corn, to cross-national homicide rates.78
Environmental Contaminants When the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention conducted a very exten-
sive evaluation of chemical and mineral contamination in 
the United States just a few years ago, it found that despite 
some signifi cant improvements there are still many danger-
ous substances in the environment, including lead, copper, 
cadmium, mercury, and inorganic gases such as chlorine 
and nitrogen dioxide.79 Prolonged exposure to these sub-
stances can cause severe illness or death; at more moderate 
levels, they have been linked to emotional and behavioral 
disorders.80 Among the suspects that have been linked to 
developmental delays and emotional problems are chemicals 
used in the agricultural business in insecticides and pesti-
cides. Another suspected cause with dysfunctional behavior 
is phthalates, industrial chemicals widely used as solvents 
and ingredients in plastics. Thousands of household items, 
from shampoos to flooring products, contain phthalates, 
and research shows that exposure is related to childhood 
misbehavior and improper functioning.81 One such sub-
stance, chlorpyrifos, is now banned for residential use but 
is still allowed for agriculture and commercial enterprises. 
Recent research by Virginia Rauh and her colleagues found 
that children exposed to large amounts of chlorpyrifos be-
fore birth maintain an increased risk for personal problems 
such as attention defi cit hyperactivity disorder (highly ex-
posed children were signifi cantly more likely to score lower 
on measures of psychomotor and mental development).82
These outcomes have been linked to antisocial behavior.
The link between neurological deficiencies such as 
ADHD and antisocial behavior will be discussed more 
fully later in this chapter.
CONNECTIONS
Lead Ingestion A number of recent research studies have 
suggested that lead ingestion is linked to aggressive behav-
iors on both a macro- or group/nation level and on a micro- 
or individual case level.83
On a macro-level, areas with the highest concentrations 
of lead also report the highest levels of homicide.84 Exam-
ining changes in lead levels in the United States, Britain, 
Drugs that decrease testosterone levels are now being 
used to treat male sex offenders.66 The female hormones, 
estrogen and progesterone, have been administered to sex 
offenders to decrease their sexual potency.67 The long-term 
side effects of this treatment and the potential danger are 
still unknown.68
Premenstrual Syndrome Hormonal research has not 
been limited to male offenders. The suspicion has long 
existed that the onset of the menstrual cycle triggers ex-
cessive amounts of the female sex hormones, which affect 
antisocial, aggressive behavior. This condition is com-
monly referred to as premenstrual syndrome, or PMS.69
The link between PMS and delinquency was fi rst popular-
ized more than 35 years ago by Katharina Dalton, whose 
studies of English women indicated that females are more 
likely to commit suicide and be aggressive and otherwise 
antisocial just before or during menstruation.70 Based on 
her fi ndings, lawyers began using PMS as a legal criminal 
defense that was accepted in courts in England and the 
United States.71
Dalton’s research is often cited as evidence of the link 
between PMS and crime, but methodological problems 
make it impossible to accept her findings at face value. 
There is still signifi cant debate over any link between PMS 
and aggression. Some doubters argue that the relationship 
is spurious; it is equally likely that the psychological and 
physical stress of aggression brings on menstruation and 
not vice versa.72
Diana Fishbein, a noted expert on biosocial theory, con-
cludes that there is in fact an association between elevated 
levels of female aggression and menstruation. Research ef-
forts, she argues, show (a) that a significant number of 
incarcerated females committed their crimes during the 
premenstrual phase and (b) that at least a small percentage 
of women appear vulnerable to cyclical hormonal changes, 
which makes them more prone to anxiety and hostility.73
While the debate is ongoing, it is important to remember 
that the overwhelming majority of females who do suffer 
anxiety reactions prior to and during menstruation do not 
actually engage in violent criminal behavior; so any link be-
tween PMS and crime is tenuous at best.74
Allergies Allergies are defi ned as unusual or excessive re-
actions of the body to foreign substances.75 For example, 
hay fever is an allergic reaction caused when pollen cells 
enter the body and are fought or neutralized by the body’s 
natural defenses. The result of the battle is itching, red eyes 
and active sinuses.
Cerebral allergies cause an excessive reaction in the 
brain, whereas neuroallergies affect the nervous system. 
Neuroallergies and cerebral allergies are believed to cause 
the allergic person to produce enzymes that attack whole-
some foods as if they were dangerous to the body.76 They 
may also cause swelling of the brain and produce sensitivity 
in the central nervous system, conditions linked to mental,

aggressive behavior.90 There is also evidence linking lead 
exposure to mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, which 
have been linked to antisocial behaviors.91
The CDC survey found that among children ages 1 
to 5, the average blood lead level was about 2.2 percent, 
which was down from 4.4 percent a decade ago. While the 
improvement is welcome, exposure of children to lead in 
homes containing lead-based paint and lead-contaminated 
dust remains a serious public health concern.92 Research 
also shows that lead effects may actually begin in the womb 
due to the mother’s dietary consumption of foods, such as 
seafood, that are high in lead content.93 Improved prenatal 
care may help mothers avoid the danger of lead exposure 
and reduce long-term crime rates.
Neurophysiological Conditions 
and Crime
Some researchers focus their attention on neurophysiol-
ogy, the study of brain activity.94 They believe neurological 
and physical abnormalities are acquired as early as the fetal 
or prenatal stage or through birth delivery trauma and that 
they control behavior throughout the life span.95
Studies conducted in the United States and in other 
nations have indicated that the relationship between im-
pairment in executive brain functions (such as abstract rea-
soning, problem-solving skills, and motor behavior skills) 
and aggressive behavior is signifi cant.96 Children who suffer 
from measurable neurological defi cits at birth are believed to 
also suffer from a number of antisocial traits throughout their 
life course, ranging from habitual lying to 
antisocial violence.97
The association between neurological 
disorder and antisocial behaviors may 
take a number of different paths:
Direct association.
 
■
 Neurological 
defi cits may be a direct cause of an-
tisocial behavior, including violent 
offending.98 The presence of brain 
abnormality causes irrational and 
destructive behaviors. Clinical analy-
sis of convicted murderers by Peer 
Briken and colleagues found that 
a signifi cant number (31 percent) 
showed evidence of brain abnormali-
ties, including epilepsy, traumatic 
brain injury, childhood encephalitis, 
or meningitis causing brain damage, 
genetic disorders, and unspecifi ed 
brain damage.99 In addition, the sub-
jects with brain abnormalities were 
signifi cantly more likely to commit 
multiple murders.
Canada, France, Australia, Finland, Italy, West Germany, and 
New Zealand (lead levels changed when nations phased out 
lead-containing paint and gasoline), economist Rick Nevin 
found that long-term worldwide trends in crime levels cor-
relate significantly with changes in environmental levels 
of lead. Nevin discovered that children exposed to higher 
levels of lead during the preschool developmental years en-
gaged in higher rates of offending when they reached their 
late teens and early twenties. His conclusion: 65 to 90 per-
cent or more of the substantial variation in violent crime 
in all these countries was explained by lead. In the United 
States, juvenile arrest rates skyrocketed in the 1960s, an in-
crease that tracked the increase in the use of leaded gas us-
age after World War II. As the use of leaded gas declined, so 
too did crime rates.85
On a micro-level, research fi nds that even limited ex-
posure to lead can have a deleterious infl uence on a child’s 
development and subsequent behavior and correlates sig-
nifi cantly with neurological conditions such as hyperac-
tivity.86 Delinquents are almost four times more likely to 
have high bone-lead levels than children in the general 
population.87 Criminologist Deborah Denno investigated 
the behavior of more than 900 African American youths 
and found that lead poisoning was one of the most signifi -
cant predictors of male delinquency and persistent adult 
criminality.88 Herbert Needleman and his associates have 
conducted a number of studies indicating that youths who 
had high lead concentrations in their bones were much 
more likely to report attention problems, delinquency, 
and aggressiveness than those who were lead free.89 Re-
cent research shows that almost any elevated level of lead 
ingestion is related to lower IQ scores, a factor linked to

Now in a new home, Benita is still recovering from being exposed to lead poisoning in the 
apartment. Some criminologists believe that early and prolonged exposure to lead is related 
to antisocial behavior in adolescence.

hypothalamus, medial temporal lobe, superior parietal, and 
left angular gyrus areas of the brain.108 Some research us-
ing PET shows that domestic violence offenders have lower 
metabolism in the right hypothalamus and decreased cor-
relations between cortical and subcortical brain structures 
than a group of control subjects.109 Daniel Amen and his 
colleagues employed SPECT to test a sample of people con-
victed of an impulsive murder. They found that these of-
fenders suffered from a condition that reduced blood fl ow 
to a region of the brain involved with planning and self-
control. Because this area of the brain is believed to control 
anger management, those who suffer reduced blood fl ow 
may be limited in their self-control, planning, and under-
standing of future consequences when challenged or forced 
to concentrate.110
It is possible that antisocial behavior is infl uenced by 
what is referred to as prefrontal dysfunction, a condition 
that occurs when demands on brain activity overload the 
prefrontal cortex and result in a lack of control over antiso-
cial behaviors. Because the prefrontal lobes have not fully 
developed in adolescence, it is not surprising that this is the 
time that violent behavior peaks.111
Minimal Brain Dysfunction Minimal brain dysfunction 
(MBD) is related to an abnormality in cerebral structure. It 
has been defi ned as an abruptly appearing, maladaptive be-
havior that interrupts an individual’s lifestyle and life fl ow. 
In its most serious form, MBD has been linked to serious 
antisocial acts, an imbalance in the urge-control mecha-
nisms of the brain, and chemical abnormality. Included in 
the category of minimal brain dysfunction are several ab-
normal behavior patterns: dyslexia, visual perception prob-
lems, hyperactivity, poor attention span, temper tantrums, 
and aggressiveness. One type of minimal brain dysfunction 
is manifested through episodic periods of explosive rage. 
This form of the disorder is considered an important cause 
of such behavior as spouse beating, child abuse, suicide, ag-
gressiveness, and motiveless homicide. One perplexing fea-
ture of this syndrome is that people who are affl icted with 
it often maintain warm and pleasant personalities between 
episodes of violence. Some studies measuring the presence 
of MBD in offender populations have found that up to 60 
percent exhibit brain dysfunction on psychological tests.112 
Criminals have been characterized as having a dysfunction 
of the dominant hemisphere of the brain.113 Researchers 
using brain wave data have predicted with 95 percent ac-
curacy the recidivism of violent criminals.114 More sophis-
ticated brain scanning techniques, such as PET, have also 
shown that brain abnormality is linked to violent crime.115
Learning Disabilities One specifi c type of MBD that has 
generated considerable interest is learning disability (LD), 
a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological pro-
cesses involved in understanding or using spoken or writ-
ten languages. Learning-disabled children usually exhibit 
poor motor coordination (for example, problems with poor 
Indirect association.
 
■
 Being in possession of a neurologi-
cal impairment leads to the development of personal-
ity traits that are linked to antisocial behaviors. For 
example, impulsivity and lack of self-control have been 
linked to antisocial behavior. While the prevailing wis-
dom is that self-control is a product of socialization and 
upbringing, there is now evidence that self-control may 
in fact be regulated and controlled by the prefrontal 
cortex of the brain.100 Under this scenario, neurological 
impairment reduces impulse- and self-control, which 
leads to damaging behavioral choices.
Interactive cause.
 
■
 Neurological defi cits may interact with 
another trait or social condition to produce antisocial 
behaviors. Take for instance the research conducted by 
Adrian Raine, which found that kids who had experi-
enced birth complications indicative of neurological im-
pairment and had also experienced maternal rejection 
as they matured were more likely to engage in criminal 
offending than boys who did not experience these 
symptoms.101 The combination of neurological dysfunc-
tion and maternal rejection had a more powerful infl u-
ence on behavior than either of these conditions alone.
Measuring Neurological Impairment There are numer-
ous ways to measure neurological functioning, including 
memorization and visual awareness tests, short-term au-
ditory memory tests, and verbal IQ tests. These tests have 
been found to distinguish criminal offenders from noncrim-
inal control groups.102
Traditionally, the most important measure of neurophys-
iological functioning is the electroencephalograph (EEG), 
which records the electrical impulses given off by the 
brain.103 It represents a signal composed of various rhythms 
and transient electrical discharges, commonly called brain 
waves, which can be recorded by electrodes placed on the 
scalp. The frequency is given in cycles per second, mea-
sured in hertz (Hz), and usually ranges from 0.5 to 30 Hz. 
Studies using the EEG fi nd that violent criminals have far 
higher levels of abnormal EEG recordings than nonviolent 
or one-time offenders. Although about 5 percent of the gen-
eral population have abnormal EEG readings, about 50 to 
60 percent of adolescents with known behavior disorders 
display abnormal recordings.104 Behaviors highly correlated 
with abnormal EEG include poor impulse control, inad-
equate social adaptation, hostility, temper tantrums, and de-
structiveness.105 Studies of adults have associated slow and 
bilateral brain waves with hostile, hypercritical, irritable, 
nonconforming, and impulsive behavior.106
Newer brain scanning techniques, using electronic im-
aging such as positron emission tomography (PET), brain 
electrical activity mapping (BEAM), single photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT), and the superconducting 
quantum interference device (SQUID) have made it pos-
sible to assess which areas of the brain are directly linked 
to antisocial behavior.107 Violent criminals have been found 
to have impairment in the prefrontal lobes, thalamus,

150  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
There are also ties to family turmoil: parents of ADHD 
children are more likely to be divorced or separated, and 
ADHD children are much more likely to move to new lo-
cales than non-ADHD children.120 It may be possible, then, 
that emotional turmoil either produces symptoms of ADHD 
or, if they already exist, causes them to intensify.
A series of research studies now links ADHD to the on-
set and sustenance of a delinquent career.121 Children with 
ADHD are more likely than non-ADHD youths to use illicit 
drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes in adolescence; to be arrested; 
to be charged with a felony; and to have multiple arrests.
Many ADHD children also suffer from conduct disorder 
(CD) and continually engage in aggressive and antisocial be-
havior in early childhood. The disorders are sustained over 
the life course: children diagnosed with ADHD are more 
likely to be suspended from school and engage in criminal 
behavior as adults. This ADHD–crime association is impor-
tant because symptoms of ADHD seem stable through ado-
lescence into adulthood.122
In addition to adolescent misbehavior, hyperactive or 
ADHD children are at greater risk for antisocial activity 
and drug use/abuse that persists into adulthood.123 There 
is some evidence that ADHD youths who also exhibit early 
hand-eye coordination, trouble climbing stairs, clumsiness), 
have behavior problems (lack of emotional control, hostil-
ity, cannot stay on task), and have improper auditory and 
vocal responses (do not seem to hear, cannot differentiate 
sounds and noises).116 Though learning disabilities are quite 
common (approximately 10 percent of all youths have some 
form of learning disorders), estimates of LD among kids 
who engage in antisocial behavior is far higher.117
What is the association between learning disabilities and 
crime? There are two popular explanations:
Susceptibility rationale 
 
■
argues that the link is caused by 
certain side effects of learning disabilities, such as im-
pulsiveness, poor ability to learn from experience, and 
inability to take social cues.
School failure rationale 
 
■
assumes that the frustration 
caused by the LD produces poor school performance 
leading to a negative self-image and acting-out behavior.
Some recent research conducted by Tomer Einat and 
Amela Einat in Israel might help settle this issue. They found 
that a far higher percentage of Israeli prison inmates (69.6 
percent) were characterized as learning disabled, as op-
posed to an estimated 10 to 15 percent of the general Israeli 
population. Among the inmates, learning disabilities were 
correlated both with low level of education (dropping out of 
school at an early age) and early age of criminal onset. Their 
conclusion: people with learning disabilities who give up 
school at early stages due to their disabilities are more likely 
to initiate a criminal career at an early age, as compared to 
individuals—with or without learning disabilities—who do 
not leave school. Helping LD kids adjust to school may also 
help them avoid criminal careers.118
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Many 
parents have noticed that their children do not pay attention 
to them—they run around and do things in their own way. 
Sometimes this inattention is a function of age; in other in-
stances, it is a symptom of attention defi cit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), in which a child shows a developmen-
tally inappropriate lack of attention, impulsivity, and hyper-
activity. The various symptoms of ADHD are described in 
Exhibit 5.2.
About 3 percent of U.S. children (most often boys, but 
the condition can also affect girls) are believed to suffer from 
this disorder, and it is the most common reason children are 
referred to mental health clinics. ADHD has been associated 
with poor school performance, grade retention, placement 
in special needs classes, bullying, stubbornness, and lack 
of response to discipline. Although the origin of ADHD is 
still unknown, suspected causes include neurological dam-
age, prenatal stress, and even reactions to food additives 
and chemical allergies. Some psychologists believe that the 
syndrome is essentially a chemical problem, specifically, 
an impairment in the chemical system that supports rapid 
and efficient communication in the brain’s management 
system.119

had dysfunction of the temporal and frontal regions of the 
brain.130
There is evidence that people with tumors are prone to 
depression, irritability, temper outbursts, and even homi-
cidal attacks. Clinical case studies of patients suffering from 
brain tumors indicate that previously docile people may un-
dergo behavior changes so great that they attempt to seri-
ously harm their families and friends. When the tumor is 
removed, their behavior returns to normal.131 In addition to 
brain tumors, head injuries caused by accidents, such as falls 
or auto crashes, have been linked to personality reversals 
marked by outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior.132
A variety of central nervous system diseases have also 
been linked to personality changes. Some of these condi-
tions include cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy, senile de-
mentia, Wernicke-Korsakoff’s syndrome, and Huntington’s 
chorea. Associated symptoms of these diseases are mem-
ory deficiency, orientation loss, and affective (emotional) 
disturbances dominated by rage, anger, and increased 
irritability.133
Brain Chemistry Neurotransmitters are chemical com-
pounds that influence or activate brain functions. Those 
studied in relation to aggression include dopamine, nor-
epinephrine, serotonin, monoamine oxidase, and GABA.134 
Evidence exists that abnormal levels of these chemicals are 
associated with aggression. For example, several researchers 
have reported inverse correlations between serotonin con-
centrates in the blood and impulsive and/or suicidal behav-
ior.135 Recent studies of habitually violent Finnish criminals 
show that low serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) levels 
are associated with poor impulse control and hyperactivity. 
signs of MBD and conduct disorder (such as 
fi ghting) are the most at risk for persistent 
antisocial behaviors continuing into adult-
hood. For example, Jason Fletcher and Bar-
bara Wolfe evaluated data on nearly 14,000 
individuals participating in the National 
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health 
(also known as Add Health) and found 
that children with ADHD are at a height-
ened risk for criminality as adults. The data 
showed that participants with the inatten-
tive type of ADHD were 6.5 percent more 
likely to commit a crime than their non-
ADHD peers, while those with impulsive 
symptoms were 11 percent more likely and 
those with a combination of both inatten-
tion and hyperactivity were 5 percent more 
likely to report participating in criminal ac-
tivities as young adults.124 Another recent 
study by Patricia Westmoreland and her 
associates, which assessed more than 300 
randomly selected prison inmates, found 
that more than 20 percent could be diagnosed with ADHD, 
and these inmates were more likely to report problems with 
emotional and social functioning and to have higher suicide 
risk scores than non-sufferers. The ADHD groups also had 
higher rates of mood, anxiety, psychotic, antisocial, and bor-
derline personality disorders.125
How is ADHD treated? Today, the most typical treatment 
is doses of stimulants, such as Ritalin, which ironically help 
control emotional and behavioral outbursts. Other thera-
pies, such as altering diet and food intake, are now being 
investigated.126 However, treatment is not always effective. 
While some treated children with ADHD improve, many 
do not and continue to show a greater occurrence of ex-
ternalizing (acting-out) behaviors and signifi cant defi cits in 
areas such as social skills, peer relations, and academic per-
formance over the life course. A recent study by Stephen 
Hinshaw and his associates compared groups of ADHD and 
non-ADHD girls and found that even after treatment about 
four-fi fths of the ADHD girls required social services such as 
special education, tutoring, or psychotherapy, compared to 
only one-seventh of the comparison girls; 50 percent of the 
ADHD girls exhibited oppositional defi ant disorder, com-
pared to only 7 percent of the control group.127
Tumors, Lesions, Injury, and Disease The presence of 
brain tumors and lesions has also been linked to a wide 
variety of psychological problems, including personality 
changes, hallucinations, and psychotic episodes.128 Per-
sistent criminality has been linked to lesions in the frontal 
and temporal regions of the brain, which play an important 
role in regulating and inhibiting human behavior, includ-
ing formulating plans and controlling intentions.129 Clinical 
evaluation of depressed and aggressive psychopathic sub-
jects showed a signifi cant number (more than 75 percent)

This scan compares a normal brain (left) and an ADHD brain (right). Areas of orange 
and white demonstrate a higher rate of metabolism, while areas of blue and green 
represent an abnormally low metabolic rate. Why is ADHD so prevalent in the United 
States today? Some experts believe that our immigrant forebears, risk takers who 
impulsively left their homelands for life in a new world, may have brought with them 
a genetic predisposition for ADHD.

seek to maintain a preferred or optimal level of arousal: 
too much stimulation leaves us anxious and stressed out; 
too little makes us feel bored and weary. There is, however, 
variation in the way people’s brains process sensory input. 
Some nearly always feel comfortable with little stimulation, 
whereas others require a high degree of environmental in-
put to feel comfortable. The latter are “sensation seekers,” 
who seek out stimulating activities, which may include ag-
gressive, violent behavior patterns.141
Evidence that some people may have lower levels of 
arousal comes from studies on resting heart rate levels con-
ducted by Adrian Raine and his associates, who found that 
antisocial children have lower resting heart rates than the 
general population. Raine speculates that some people lack 
fear and are nonresponsive to the threat of punishment, a 
condition that allows them to feel relatively comfortable 
while engaging in antisocial encounters. People who have 
low arousal levels will seek out risky situations and become 
more involved with criminal behavior as an avenue toward 
thrill seeking. Because lack of fear and thrill-seeking behav-
ior are characteristics of adult psychopaths, antisocial chil-
dren might therefore develop into psychopaths as adults.142
The factors that determine a person’s level of arousal are 
not fully determined, but suspected sources include:
Brain chemistry (and brain structure).
 
■
 Some people have 
brains with many more nerve cells with receptor sites 
for neurotransmitters than others.
Heart rate.
 
■
 Another view is that people with low heart-
beat rates are more likely to commit crime because they 
seek stimulation to increase their feelings of arousal to 
normal levels.143
Autonomic nervous system.
 
■
 Some biosocial theorists link 
arousal to the autonomic nervous system as measured 
by skin conductance response. People with abnormally 
exaggerated skin conductivity may react with above 
average negative emotional intensity to stimulus that 
would have little effect on the average person. As a re-
sult, provocations that some people might merely shrug 
off are viewed as highly confrontational, infl ammatory, 
insulting, and deserving of an aggressive reply.144
In sum, brain structure, chemistry, and development are 
believed to exert a strong infl uence on human behavior.
Genetics and Crime
On July 14, 1955, Richard Franklin Speck broke into a dor-
mitory and systematically tortured, raped, and murdered 
eight student nurses in one of the most horrifi c cases of mass 
murder in the nation’s history. Genetic testing showed that 
Speck had an abnormal XYY chromosomal structure (XY is 
normal in males), a fi nding that provoked a national frenzy: 
was it possible that all people with XYYs were potential kill-
ers? Civil libertarians expressed fear that all XYYs could be 
labeled dangerous and violent regardless of whether they 
In addition, a relatively low concentration of 5-hydroxyin-
doleactic acid (5-HIAA) is predictive of increased irritability, 
sensation seeking, and impaired impulse control.136
What is the link between brain chemistry and crime? 
Prenatal exposure of the brain to high levels of androgens 
can result in a brain structure that is less sensitive to en-
vironmental inputs. Affected individuals seek more intense 
and varied stimulation and are willing to tolerate more ad-
verse consequences than individuals not so affected.137 Such 
exposure also results in a rightward shift in (brain) hemi-
spheric functioning and a concomitant diminution of cogni-
tive and emotional tendencies. One result of this tendency 
is that left-handers are disproportionately represented in the 
criminal population since the movement of each hand tends 
to be controlled by the hemisphere of the brain on the op-
posite side of the body.
It has also been suggested that individuals with a low 
supply of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (known either by 
the acronym MOMA or MAO) engage in behaviors linked 
with violence and property crime, including defiance of 
punishment, impulsivity, hyperactivity, poor academic 
performance, sensation seeking and risk taking, and recre-
ational drug use.138 Abnormal levels of MAO may explain 
both individual and group differences in the crime rate. For 
example, females have higher levels of MAO than males, a 
condition that may explain gender differences in the crime 
rate.139
The brain and neurological system can produce natu-
ral or endogenous opiates that are chemically similar to the 
narcotics opium and morphine. It has been suggested that 
the risk and thrills involved in crime cause the neurologi-
cal system to produce increased amounts of these natural 
narcotics. The result is an elevated mood state, perceived 
as an exciting and rewarding experience that acts as a posi-
tive reinforcement for crime.140 The brain then produces its 
own natural high as a reward for risk-taking behavior. Some 
people achieve this high by rock climbing and skydiving; 
others engage in crimes of violence.
Because this linkage has been found, it is not uncommon 
for violence-prone people to be treated with antipsychotic 
drugs such as Haldol, Stelazine, Prolixin, and Risperdal, 
which help control levels of neurotransmitters (such as sero-
tonin/dopamine); these are sometimes referred to as chemi-
cal restraints or chemical straitjackets.
Arousal Theory
It has long been suspected that obtaining thrills is a crime 
motivator. Adolescents may engage in crimes such as shop-
lifting and vandalism simply because they offer the attraction 
of “getting away with it”; from this perspective, delinquency 
is a thrilling demonstration of personal competence.
According to arousal theory, for a variety of genetic 
and environmental reasons, some people’s brains function 
differently in response to environmental stimuli. All of us

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  153
The Cambridge fi ndings are not unique. Data from the 
Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS), a longitudinal 
analysis that has been monitoring the behavior of 1,000 up-
state New York area youths since 1988, also fi nds an inter-
generational continuity in antisocial behavior.156
It is possible, of course, that the genetic effect of paren-
tal deviance may be exaggerated by mating practices. For 
example, if an antisocial male partners with an antisocial 
female and breeds antisocial children, it appears to be a ge-
netic effect. But it is also possible that this “antisocial” family 
consists of people who have suffered labeling and stigma, 
isolating them from the mainstream and increasing their 
chances of criminality. While it may appear that they pro-
duce children who are genetically predisposed to crime, it is 
also possible that what appears to be a genetic effect is actu-
ally the product of social processes.157
Sibling Similarities It stands to reason that if the cause of 
crime is in part genetic, then the behavior of siblings should 
be similar because they share genetic material. Research does 
show that if one sibling engages in antisocial behavior, so 
do his/her brothers and sisters. The effect is greatest among 
same-sex siblings.158 Sibling pairs who report warm, mutual 
relationships and share friends are the most likely to behave 
in a similar fashion; those who maintain a close relationship 
also have similar rates of crime and drug abuse.159
While the similarity of siblings’ behavior seems striking, 
what appears to be a genetic effect may also be explained by 
other factors:
Siblings who live in the same environment are infl u-
 
■
enced by similar social and economic factors.
Deviant siblings may grow closer because of shared 
 
■
interests.
Younger siblings who admire their older siblings may 
 
■
imitate the elders’ behavior.
The deviant sibling forces or threatens the brother or 
 
■
sister into committing criminal acts.
Siblings living in a similar environment may develop 
 
■
similar types of friends; it is peer behavior that is the 
critical infl uence. The infl uence of peers may negate any 
observed interdependence of sibling behavior.160
Twin Behavior As mentioned above, because siblings are 
usually brought up in the same household and share com-
mon life experiences, any similarity in their antisocial be-
havior might be a function of environmental infl uences and 
experiences and not genetics at all. To guard against this, 
biosocial theorists have compared the behavior of same-
sex twins and again found concordance in their behavior 
patterns.161
However, an even more rigorous test of genetic theory 
involves comparison of the behavior of identical monozy-
gotic (MZ) twins with fraternal dizygotic (DZ) twins; while 
the former have an identical genetic makeup, the latter 
share only about 50 percent of their genetic combinations. 
had engaged in violent activities.145 Interest in the XYY the-
ory dissipated when it was disclosed that Speck did not ac-
tually have an extra Y chromosome.146 However, the Speck 
case drew researchers’ attention to looking for a genetic basis 
of crime. Contemporary biosocial theorists are interested in 
the role genetics plays in shaping human behavior and want 
to uncover if the propensity to commit crime is an inherited 
trait passed down from one generation to the next.147
The relationship between inherited traits and crime may 
be either direct or indirect:
Direct association
 
■
. Possessing a particular genetic struc-
ture makes a person prone to aggression, violence, and 
antisocial behavior.148 Regardless of environmental 
infl uences, people with a particular genetic code get 
involved in antisocial behaviors. This explains deviant 
behavior among the rich and famous, some of whom 
may be the product of a damaged genetic package; it 
also explains why the majority of those who are poor 
and desperate are still neither violent nor crime prone, 
since the environment plays only a secondary role in 
the production of deviant behaviors.
Indirect association.
 
■
 Possessing a particular genetic 
makeup is associated with behaviors, attitudes, and per-
sonality traits that are also linked to antisocial behavior. 
Personality conditions linked to aggression such as psy-
chopathy, impulsivity, and neuroticism have been found 
to be heritable.149 Genetics shapes the way kids view 
their family relationships; whether they believe they 
have a strong attachment to parental socialization is also 
a strong predictor of crime and delinquency.150
Testing Genetic Theory If criminal tendencies are inher-
ited, then it stands to reason that the children of criminal 
parents should be more likely to become law violators than 
the offspring of conventional parents. A number of studies 
have found that parental criminality and deviance do, in 
fact, have a powerful infl uence on delinquent behavior.151 
Some of the most important data on parental deviance have 
been gathered as part of a long-term study of English youth 
called the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development 
(CSDD). This research has followed a group of about 1,000 
males from the time they were 8 years old until today, when 
they are in their adulthood. The males in the study have 
been repeatedly interviewed and their school and police re-
cords evaluated. These cohort data indicate that a signifi -
cant number of delinquent youths have criminal fathers.152 
While 8.4 percent of the sons of noncriminal fathers eventu-
ally became chronic offenders, about 37 percent of youths 
with criminal fathers were multiple offenders.153 More re-
cent analysis of the data confi rms that delinquent youths 
grow up to become the parents of antisocial children.154 
One specifi c form of aggressive behavior that seems to be 
inherited is school yard bullying: bullies have children who 
bully others, and these second-generation bullies grow up 
to become the fathers of children who are also bullies, in a 
never-ending cycle.155

relationship between identical twins may be stronger and 
more enduring than other sibling pairs so that contagion and 
not genetics explains their behavioral similarities. Accord-
ing to Marshall Jones and Donald Jones, the contagion effect 
may also help explain why the behavior of twins is more 
similar in adulthood than in adolescence.169 Youthful mis-
behavior is infl uenced by friends and peer group relation-
ships. As adults, the infl uence of peers may wane as people 
marry and fi nd employment. In contrast, twin infl uence is 
everlasting; if one twin is antisocial, it legitimizes and sup-
ports the criminal behavior in his or her co-twin. This effect 
may grow even stronger in adulthood because twin relations 
are more enduring than any other. What seems to be a ge-
netic effect may actually be the result of sibling interaction 
with a brother or sister who engages in antisocial activity.
Adoption Studies One way of avoiding the pitfalls of twin 
studies is to focus attention on the behavior of adoptees. 
It seems logical that if the behavior of adopted children is 
more closely aligned to that of their biological parents than 
to that of their adoptive parents, then the idea of a genetic 
basis for criminality would be supported. If, on the other 
hand, adoptees are more closely aligned to the behavior of 
their adoptive parents than their biological parents, an envi-
ronmental basis for crime would seem more valid.
Several studies indicate that some relationship exists be-
tween biological parents’ behavior and the behavior of their 
children, even when their contact has been nonexistent.170 
One analysis of Swedish adoptees also found that genetic 
factors are highly signifi cant, accounting for 59 percent of 
the variation in their petty crime rates. Boys who had crimi-
nal parents were signifi cantly more likely to violate the law. 
Environmental infl uences and economic status were signifi -
cantly less important, explaining about 19 percent of the 
variance in crime. Nonetheless, having a positive environ-
ment, such as being adopted into a more affluent home, 
helped inhibit genetic predisposition.171
The genes–crime relationship is controversial because it 
implies that the propensity to commit crime is present at 
birth and cannot be altered. It raises moral dilemmas: if in 
utero genetic testing could detect a gene for violence, and a 
violence gene was found to be present, what could be done 
as a precautionary measure?
Evolutionary Theory
Some criminologists believe the human traits that produce 
violence and aggression are produced through the long pro-
cess of human evolution.172 According to this evolutionary 
view, the competition for scarce resources has infl uenced and 
shaped the human species.173 Over the course of human ex-
istence, people whose personal characteristics enable them 
to accumulate more than others are the most likely to breed 
and dominate the species. People have been shaped to engage 
Research has shown that MZ twins are signifi cantly closer in 
their personal characteristics, such as intelligence, than are 
DZ twins.162
The earliest studies conducted on the behavior of twins 
detected a signifi cant relationship between the criminal ac-
tivities of MZ twins and a much lower association between 
those of DZ twins. A review of relevant studies conducted 
between 1929 and 1961 found that 60 percent of MZ twins 
shared criminal behavior patterns (if one twin was criminal, 
so was the other), whereas only 30 percent of DZ twin behav-
ior was similarly related.163 These fi ndings may be viewed as 
powerful evidence that a genetic basis for criminality exists.
One famous study of twin behavior still under way is 
the Minnesota Twin Family Study. This research compares 
the behavior of MZ and DZ twin pairs who were raised to-
gether with others who were separated at birth and in some 
cases did not even know of each other’s existence. The study 
shows some striking similarities in behavior and ability for 
twin pairs raised apart. An MZ twin reared away from a 
co-twin has about as good a chance of being similar to the 
 co-twin in terms of personality, interests, and attitudes as 
one who has been reared with his or her co-twin. The con-
clusion: similarities between twins are due to genes, not the 
environment.).164
Evaluating Genetic Research Twin studies also have 
their detractors. Some opponents suggest that available 
evidence provides little conclusive proof that crime is ge-
netically predetermined. Not all research efforts have found 
that MZ twin pairs are more closely related in their criminal 
behavior than DZ or ordinary sibling pairs, and some that 
have found an association note that it is at best “modest.”165 
Those who oppose the genes–crime relationship point to 
the inadequate research designs and weak methodologies 
of supporting research. The newer, better-designed research 
studies, critics charge, provide less support than earlier, less 
methodically sound studies.166
Even if the behavior similarities between MZ twins 
are greater than those between DZ twins, the association 
may be explained by environmental factors. MZ twins are 
more likely to look alike and to share physical traits than 
DZ twins, and they are more likely to be treated similarly. 
Similarities in their shared behavior patterns may therefore 
be a function of socialization and/or environment and not 
heredity.167
It is also possible that what appears to be a genetic ef-
fect picked up by the twin research is actually the effect of 
sibling infl uence on criminality, referred to as the contagion 
effect: genetic predispositions and early experiences make 
some people, including twins, susceptible to deviant behav-
ior, which is transmitted by the presence of antisocial sib-
lings in the household.168
The contagion effect may explain in part the higher 
concordance of deviant behaviors found in identical twins 
as compared to fraternal twins or mere siblings. The

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  155
Crime rate differences between the genders, then, may 
be less a matter of socialization than inherent differences in 
mating patterns that have developed over time.178 Among 
young men, reckless, life-threatening “risk-proneness” is 
especially likely to evolve in cultures that force males to 
fi nd suitable mates to ensure their ability to reproduce. Un-
less they are aggressive with potential mates and potential 
rivals for those suitable mates, they are doomed to remain 
childless.179
Other evolutionary factors may have infl uenced gender 
differences. Feminists have suggested that with the advent 
of agriculture and trade in prehistory, women were forced 
into a position of high dependence and limited power. They 
began to compete among themselves to secure partners 
who could provide necessary resources. As a result of these 
early evolutionary developments, intergender competition 
became greatest during periods of resource deprivation—
times when women become most dependent on a male for 
support. These trends can still be observed. For example, 
during times of high female unemployment, female–female 
aggression rates increase as women compete with each other 
for men who can provide them with support. In contrast, 
as rates of social welfare increase, female–female aggression 
rates diminish because the state serves as a readily available 
substitute for a male breadwinner.180
Evaluation of the Biosocial Branch 
of Trait Theory
Biosocial perspectives on crime have raised some challeng-
ing questions. Critics fi nd some of these theories to be rac-
ist and dysfunctional. If there are biological explanations for 
street crimes, such as assault, murder, or rape, the argument 
goes, and if, as the offi cial crime statistics suggest, the poor 
and minority-group members commit a disproportionate 
number of such acts, then by implication biological theory 
says that members of these groups are biologically different, 
fl awed, or inferior.
Some biological explanations for the geographic, social, 
and temporal patterns in the crime rate are problematic. 
Furthermore, biological theory seems to divide people into 
criminals and noncriminals on the basis of their genetic and 
physical makeup, ignoring self-reports indicating that al-
most everyone has engaged in some type of illegal activity 
during his or her lifetime.
Biosocial theorists counter that their views should not 
be confused with Lombrosian, deterministic biology. Rather 
than suggest that there are born criminals and noncrimi-
nals, they maintain that some people carry the potential to 
be violent or antisocial and that environmental conditions 
can sometimes trigger antisocial responses.181 This would 
explain why some otherwise law-abiding citizens engage in 
a single, seemingly unexplainable antisocial act, and con-
versely, why some people with long criminal careers often 
in actions that promote their well-being and ensure the sur-
vival and reproduction of their genetic line. Males who are 
impulsive risk-takers may be able to father more children be-
cause they are reckless in their social relationships and have 
sexual encounters with numerous partners. If, according to 
evolutionary theories, such behavior patterns are inherited, 
impulsive behavior becomes intergenerational, passed down 
from father to son. It is not surprising, then, that human his-
tory has been marked by war, violence, and aggression.
Violence and Evolution In their classic book Homicide, 
Martin Daly and Margo Wilson suggest that violent offenses 
are often driven by evolutionary and reproductive factors. 
High rates of spouse abuse in modern society may be a 
function of aggressive men seeking to control and possess 
mates. When females are murdered by their spouses, the 
motivating factor is typically fear of infi delity and the threat 
of attachment to a new partner. Infi delity challenges male 
dominance and future reproductive rights. It comes as no 
surprise that in some cultures, including our own, sexual 
infi delity discovered in progress by the aggrieved husband 
is viewed legally as a provocation that justifi es retaliatory 
killing.174 Men who feel most threatened over the potential 
of losing mates to rivals are the ones most likely to engage 
in sexual violence. Research shows that women in common-
law marriages, especially those who are much younger 
than their husbands, are at greater risk than older married 
women. Abusive males may fear the potential loss of their 
younger mates, especially if they are not bound by a mar-
riage contract, and may use force for purposes of control 
and possession.175 Armed robbery is another crime that may 
have evolutionary underpinnings. Though most robbers are 
caught and severely punished, it remains an alluring pur-
suit for men who want to both show their physical prowess 
and display resources with which to conquer rivals and at-
tract mates. Violent episodes are far more common among 
men who are unemployed and unmarried—in other words, 
those who may want to demonstrate their allure to the op-
posite sex but who are without the benefi t of position or 
wealth.176
Gender and Evolution Evolutionary concepts have been 
linked to gender-based differences in the crime rate. To en-
sure survival of the gene pool (and the species), it is benefi -
cial for a male of any species to mate with as many suitable 
females as possible since each can bear his offspring. In 
contrast, because of the long period of gestation, females 
require a secure home and a single, stable, nurturing part-
ner to ensure their survival. Because of these differences in 
mating patterns, the most aggressive males mate most often 
and have the greatest number of offspring. Therefore, over 
the history of the human species, aggressive males have had 
the greatest impact on the gene pool. The descendants of 
these aggressive males now account for the disproportionate 
amount of male aggression and violence.177

from justice. In his absence, the jury found him guilty on 
86 of the 87 counts, and he was eventually sentenced to 
more than 100 years in prison. Five months later, he was 
captured in the resort town of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, by 
bounty hunter Duane “Dog” Chapman. On July 3, 2003, an 
appellate court denied Luster’s appeal of his guilty verdicts 
because he had jumped bail.
How can we explain the bizarre behavior of Andrew 
Luster? Why would a wealthy, handsome man drug and 
rape unsuspecting women? Could his acts possibly be the 
result of calculation and planning, or are they the product 
of some mental aberration or personality disturbance? What 
engage in conventional behavior. It also explains why there 
are geographic and temporal patterns in the crime rate: peo-
ple who are predisposed to crime may simply have more 
opportunities to commit illegal acts in the summer in Los 
Angeles and Atlanta than in the winter in Bedford, New 
Hampshire, and Minot, North Dakota, or perhaps their hor-
monal levels become activated as the temperature rises.
The biosocial view is that behavior is a product of in-
teracting biological and environmental events.182 Physical 
impairments may make some people “at risk” to crime, 
but it is when they are linked to social and environmen-
tal problems, such as family dysfunction, that they trigger 
criminal acts.183 For example, Avshalom Caspi and his as-
sociates found that girls who reach physical maturity at an 
early age are the ones most likely to engage in delinquent 
acts. This fi nding might suggest a relationship between bio-
logical traits (hormonal activity) and crime. However, the 
Caspi research found that the association may also have an 
environmental basis. Physically mature girls are the ones 
most likely to have prolonged contact with a crime-prone 
group: older adolescent boys.184 Here, the combination of 
biological change, social relationships, and routine oppor-
tunities may predict crime rates.
The most significant criticism of biosocial theory has 
been the lack of adequate empirical testing. In most research 
efforts, sample sizes are relatively small and nonrepresen-
tative. A great deal of biosocial research is conducted with 
samples of adjudicated offenders who have been placed in 
clinical treatment settings. Methodological problems make 
it impossible to determine whether fi ndings apply only to 
offenders who have been convicted of crimes and placed in 
treatment or to the population of criminals as a whole.185 
More research is needed to clarify the relationships pro-
posed by biosocial researchers and to silence critics.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAIT 
THEORIES
Andrew Luster, an heir to the Max Factor cosmetic fortune, 
lived a privileged life of sun and fun in a beach house in an 
exclusive community near Santa Barbara. However, Andrew 
had a darker side, which came to light on July 17, 2000, 
when he was arrested after a young woman accused him of 
drugging her with the “date rape” drug GHB and then hav-
ing sex with her while she was unconscious. When police 
served a warrant on his home, they found tapes indicating 
Luster had a habit of drugging women and raping them 
while they were comatose. Halfway through the trial, Lus-
ter jumped bail, disappeared, and was declared a fugitive 
CONCEPT SUMMARY 5.1 
Biosocial Theories of Crime
Biochemical
The major premise of the theory is that crime, especially 
 
■
violence, is a function of diet, vitamin intake, hormonal 
imbalance, or food allergies.
The strengths of the theory are that it explains irrational 
 
■
violence; it shows how the environment interacts with 
personal traits to influence behavior.
The research focuses of the theory are diet, hormones, 
 
■
enzymes, environmental contaminants, and lead intake.
Neurological
The major premise of the theory is that criminals and 
 
■
delinquents often suffer brain impairment, as measured 
by the EEG. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 
minimal brain dysfunction are related to antisocial behavior.
The strengths of the theory are that it explains irrational 
 
■
violence; it shows how the environment interacts with 
personal traits to influence behavior.
The research focuses of the theory are ADD, ADHD, learning 
 
■
disabilities, brain injuries, and brain chemistry.
Genetic
The major premise of the theory is that criminal traits and 
 
■
predispositions are inherited. The criminality of parents can 
predict the delinquency of children.
The strengths of the theory are that it explains why only 
 
■
a small percentage of youth in high-crime areas become 
chronic offenders.
The research focuses of the theory are twin behavior, sibling 
 
■
behavior, and parent–child similarities.
Evolutionary
The major premise of the theory is that as the human 
 
■
race evolved, traits and characteristics have become 
ingrained. Some of these traits make people aggressive and 
predisposed to commit crime.
The strengths of the theory are that it explains high violence 
 
■
rates and aggregate gender differences in the crime rate.
The research focuses of the theory are gender differences

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  157
Freud believed that we all carry with us residue of the 
most signifi cant emotional attachments of our childhood, 
which then guide future interpersonal relationships. Today 
the term psychodynamic refers to a broad range of theories 
that focus on the infl uence of instinctive drives and forces 
and the importance of developmental processes in shaping 
personality. Contemporary psychodynamic theory places 
greater emphasis on conscious experience and its interac-
tion with the unconscious, in addition to the role that social 
factors play in development. Nonetheless, it still focuses on 
the infl uence of early childhood experiences on the devel-
opment of personality, motivation, and drives.
Elements of Psychodynamic Theory According to the 
classic version of the theory, the human personality con-
tains a three-part structure. The id is the primitive part of 
an individual’s mental makeup present at birth. It represents 
unconscious biological drives for sex, food, and other life-
sustaining necessities. The id follows the pleasure principle: 
it requires instant gratification without concern for the 
rights of others.
The ego develops early in life, when a child begins to learn 
that his or her wishes cannot be instantly gratifi ed. The ego is 
that part of the personality that compensates for the demands 
of the id by helping the individual guide his or her actions to 
remain within the boundaries of social convention. The ego is 
guided by the reality principle: it takes into account what is 
practical and conventional by societal standards.
The superego develops as a result of incorporating 
within the personality the moral standards and values of 
parents, community, and signifi cant others. It is the moral 
aspect of an individual’s personality; it passes judgments 
on behavior. The superego is divided into two parts: con-
science and ego ideal. Conscience tells what is right and 
wrong. It forces the ego to control the id and directs the 
individual into morally acceptable and responsible behav-
iors, which may not be pleasurable. Exhibit 5.3 summarizes 
Freud’s personality structure.
drives people who seem to have everything to commit bi-
zarre crimes?
The second branch of trait theories focuses on the psy-
chological aspects of crime, including the associations 
among intelligence, personality, learning, and criminal 
behavior.
Psychological theories of crime have a long history. In 
The English Convict, Charles Goring (1870–1919) stud-
ied the mental characteristics of 3,000 English convicts.186 
He found little difference in the physical characteristics of 
criminals and noncriminals, but he uncovered a signifi cant 
relationship between crime and a condition he referred to 
as defective intelligence, which involves such traits as 
feeblemindedness, epilepsy, insanity, and defective social 
instinct.187 Goring believed criminal behavior was inher-
ited and could, therefore, be controlled by regulating the 
reproduction of families who produced mentally defective 
children.
Gabriel Tarde (1843–1904) is the forerunner of modern-
day learning theorists.188 Tarde believed people learn from 
one another through a process of imitation. Tarde’s ideas are 
similar to modern social learning theorists who believe that 
both interpersonal and observed behavior, such as a movie 
or television, can infl uence criminality.
Since the pioneering work of people like Tarde and Gor-
ing, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health 
professionals have long played an active role in formulat-
ing criminological theory. In their quest to understand and 
treat all varieties of abnormal mental conditions, psycholo-
gists have encountered clients whose behavior falls within 
categories society has labeled as criminal, deviant, violent, 
and antisocial.
This section is organized along the lines of the predomi-
nant psychological views most closely associated with the 
causes of criminal behavior. Some psychologists view anti-
social behavior from a psychoanalytic or psychodynamic 
perspective: their focus is on early childhood experience 
and its effect on personality. In contrast, behaviorism 
stresses social learning and behavior modeling as the keys to 
criminality. Cognitive theory analyzes human perception 
and how it affects behavior.
Psychodynamic Theory
Psychodynamic (or psychoanalytic) psychology was origi-
nated by Viennese psychiatrist Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) 
and has since remained a prominent segment of psychologi-
cal theory.189

158  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
The psychodynamic model of the criminal offender de-
picts an aggressive, frustrated person dominated by events 
that occurred early in childhood. Perhaps because they 
may have suffered unhappy experiences in childhood or 
had families that could not provide proper love and care, 
criminals suffer from weak or damaged egos that make them 
unable to cope with conventional society. Weak egos are as-
sociated with immaturity, poor social skills, and excessive 
dependence on others. People with weak egos may be easily 
led into crime by antisocial peers and drug abuse. Some of-
fenders have underdeveloped superegos and consequently 
lack internalized representations of those behaviors that are 
punished in conventional society. They commit crimes be-
cause they have diffi culty understanding the consequences 
of their actions.191
Offenders may suffer from a garden variety of mood and/
or behavior disorders. They may be histrionic, depressed, 
antisocial, or narcissistic.192 They may suffer from conduct 
disorders, which include long histories of antisocial behav-
ior, or mood disorders characterized by disturbance in ex-
pressed emotions. Among the latter is bipolar disorder, in 
which moods alternate between periods of wild elation and 
deep depression.193 Some offenders are driven by an un-
conscious desire to be punished for prior sins, either real 
or imaginary. As a result, they may violate the law to gain 
attention or to punish their parents.
According to this view, crime is a manifestation of feel-
ings of oppression and people’s inability to develop the 
proper psychological defenses and rationales to keep these 
feelings under control. Criminality enables troubled people 
to survive by producing positive psychic results: it helps 
them to feel free and independent, and it gives them the 
possibility of excitement and the chance to use their skills 
and imagination. Crime also provides them with the prom-
ise of positive gain; it allows them to blame others for their 
predicament (for example, the police), and it gives them a 
chance to rationalize their sense of failure (“If I hadn’t gotten 
into trouble, I could have been a success”).194
Attachment Theory
Attachment theory, a view most closely associated with 
psychologist John Bowlby, is also connected to the psycho-
dynamic tradition. Bowlby believed that the ability to form 
attachments—that is, emotionally bond to another person—
has important lasting psychological implications that follow 
people across the life span. Attachments are formed soon 
after birth, when infants bond with their mothers. They will 
become frantic, crying and clinging, to prevent separation 
or to re-establish contact with a missing parent. Bowlby 
noted that this behavior is not restricted to humans and oc-
curs in all mammals, indicating that separation anxiety may 
be instinctual or evolutionary. After all, attachment fi gures, 
especially the mother, provide support and care, and with-
out attachment an infant would be helpless and could not 
Psychosexual Stages of Human Development The 
most basic human drive present at birth is eros, the instinct 
to preserve and create life. The other is the death instinct 
(thanatos), which is expressed as aggression.
Eros is expressed sexually. Consequently, very early in 
their development, humans experience sexuality, which is 
expressed by seeking pleasure through various parts of the 
body. During the fi rst year of life, a child attains pleasure by 
sucking and biting; Freud called this the oral stage. Dur-
ing the second and third years of life, the focus of sexual 
attention is on the elimination of bodily wastes—the anal 
stage. The phallic stage occurs during the third year, when 
children focus their attention on their genitals. Males be-
gin to have sexual feelings for their mothers (the Oedipus 
complex) and girls for their fathers (the Electra complex). 
Latency begins at age 6. During this period, feelings of sex-
uality are repressed until the genital stage begins at puberty; 
this marks the beginning of adult sexuality.
If confl icts are encountered during any of the psycho-
sexual stages of development, a person can become fi xated 
at that point. This means, as an adult, the fi xated person 
will exhibit behavior traits characteristic of those encoun-
tered during infantile sexual development. For example, an 
infant who does not receive enough oral gratifi cation during 
the fi rst year of life is likely as an adult to engage in such 
oral behavior as smoking, drinking, or drug abuse or to be 
clinging and dependent in personal relationships. Thus, ac-
cording to Freud, the roots of adult behavioral problems can 
be traced to problems developed in the earliest years of life.
The Psychodynamics of Antisocial Behavior Psycholo-
gists have long linked criminality to abnormal mental states 
produced by early childhood trauma. For example, Alfred 
Adler (1870–1937), the founder of individual psychology, 
coined the term inferiority complex to describe people 
who have feelings of inferiority and compensate for them 
with a drive for superiority. Controlling others may help 
reduce personal inadequacies. Erik Erikson (1902–1984) 
described the identity crisis—a period of serious personal 
questioning people undertake in an effort to determine their 
own values and sense of direction. Adolescents undergoing 
an identity crisis might exhibit out-of-control behavior and 
experiment with drugs and other forms of deviance.
The psychoanalyst whose work is most closely associ-
ated with criminality is August Aichorn.190 After examining 
many delinquent youths, Aichorn concluded that societal 
stress, though damaging, could not alone result in a life of 
crime unless a predisposition existed that psychologically 
prepared youths for antisocial acts. This mental state, which 
he labeled latent delinquency, is found in youngsters 
whose personality requires them to act in these ways:
Seek immediate gratifi cation (to act impulsively)

Consider satisfying their personal needs more impor-
 
■
tant than relating to others
Satisfy instinctive urges without considering right and

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  159
others; blaming others for mistakes or misbehavior; being 
angry and resentful; being spiteful or vindictive; swearing 
or using obscene language; or having low self-esteem. The 
person with ODD is moody and easily frustrated and may 
abuse drugs as a form of self-medication.200
 CD is typically considered a more serious group of 
behavioral and emotional problems.201 Children and ado-
lescents with CD have great diffi culty following rules and 
behaving in socially acceptable ways. They are often viewed 
by other children, adults, and social agencies as severely an-
tisocial. Research shows that they are frequently involved in 
such activities as bullying, fi ghting, committing sexual as-
saults, and cruelty to animals.
What causes CD? Numerous biosocial and psychological 
factors are suspected. There is evidence, for example, that 
interconnections between the frontal lobes and other brain 
regions may infl uence CD. There is also research showing 
that levels of serotonin can infl uence the onset of CD and 
that CD has been shown to aggregate in families, suggesting 
a genetic basis of the disorder.202
ODD and CD are not the only mood disorders associ-
ated with antisocial behavior. Some people fi nd it impossible 
to cope with feelings of oppression or depression. Research 
shows that people who are clinically depressed are more likely 
to engage in a garden variety of illegal acts.203 Some people 
suffer from alexithymia, a defi cit in emotional cognition that 
prevents them from being aware of their feelings or being able 
to understand or talk about their thoughts and emotions; they 
seem robotic and emotionally dead.204 Others may suffer from 
eating disorders and are likely to use fasting, vomiting, and 
drugs to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight.205
Psychosis and Crime The most serious forms of psy-
chological disturbance will result in mental illness referred 
to as psychosis, which includes severe mental disorders, 
such as depression, bipolar disorder (manic depression), 
and schizophrenia—characterized by extreme impairment 
of a person’s ability to think clearly, respond emotionally, 
communicate effectively, understand reality, and behave ap-
propriately. Schizophrenics may hear nonexistent voices, 
hallucinate, and make inappropriate behavioral responses. 
People with severe mental disorders exhibit illogical and in-
coherent thought processes and a lack of insight into their 
behavior. For example, they may see themselves as agents 
of the devil, avenging angels, or the recipients of messages 
from animals and plants.
David Berkowitz (the “Son of Sam” or the “44-calibre 
killer”), a noted serial killer who went on a rampage from 
1976 to 1977, exhibited these traits when he claimed that his 
killing spree began when he received messages from a neigh-
bor’s dog. Paranoid schizophrenics suffer complex behavior 
delusions involving wrongdoing or persecution—they think 
everyone is out to get them.
There is evidence that law violators suffer from a dis-
proportionate amount of severe mental health problems.206 
Female offenders seem to have more serious mental health 
survive. Bowlby also challenged Freud’s view of the devel-
opment of the ego and superego, claiming that at birth these 
were bound up in the relationship with one’s mother.195
Bowlby’s most important fi nding was that to grow up 
mentally healthy, “the infant and young child should expe-
rience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with 
his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both 
fi nd satisfaction and enjoyment.”196
According to this view, failing to develop proper attach-
ment may cause people to fall prey to a number of psycho-
logical disorders. Psychologists believe that children with 
attachment problems lack trust and respect for others. They 
often display many psychological symptoms, some of which 
resemble attention defi cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
They may be impulsive and have diffi culty concentrating, 
and consequently experience diffi culty in school. As adults, 
they often have diffi culty initiating and sustaining relation-
ships with others and fi nd it diffi cult to sustain romantic 
relationships. Criminologists have linked people having de-
tachment problems with a variety of antisocial behaviors, 
including sexual assault and child abuse.197 It has been sug-
gested that boys disproportionately experience disrupted at-
tachment and that these disruptions are causally related to 
disproportionate rates of male offending.198
Mental Disorders and Crime
According to the psychodynamic tradition, traumatic life 
events can bring about severe mental disorders that have 
been linked to the onset of crime and deviance. Mental disor-
ders typically involve a psychological condition that disrupts 
thinking, feeling, and other important psychological pro-
cesses. They may cause people to deviate from social expec-
tations and impair their everyday functioning. A less severe 
form are mood disorders—prolonged and intense emotional 
upheavals that shape and color a person’s psychic life. A 
more severe mental disorder is referred to as psychosis and 
is characterized by derangement of personality and loss of 
contact with reality, thereby causing deterioration of normal 
social functioning. These are discussed more fully below.
Mood Disorders and Crime Psychologists recognize a va-
riety of mental disorders that may be linked to antisocial be-
havior. Adolescents who are frequently uncooperative and 
hostile and who seem to be much more diffi cult than other 
children the same age may be suffering from a psychologi-
cal condition known as disruptive behavior disorder (DBD), 
which can take on two distinct forms: oppositional defi ant 
disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD).199 Children suffer-
ing from ODD experience an ongoing pattern of uncoopera-
tive, defi ant, and hostile behavior toward authority fi gures 
that seriously interferes with the youngsters’ day-to-day 
functioning. Symptoms of ODD may include frequent loss 
of temper and constant arguing with adults; defying adults 
or refusing adult requests or rules; deliberately annoying

to withdraw or harm themselves than to act aggressively to-
ward others.220 Mentally disordered inmates who do recidi-
vate upon release appear to do so for the same reasons as 
the mentally sound—extensive criminal histories, substance 
abuse, and family dysfunction—rather than as a result of 
their illness.221
It is also possible that the link between mental disorder 
and crime is spurious and an artifact of some intervening 
factor: the factors that cause mental turmoil also cause an-
tisocial behaviors. People who suffer child abuse are more 
likely to have mental anguish and commit violent acts; child 
abuse is the actual cause of both problems.222
Mentally ill people may be more likely to lack fi nancial 
resources than the mentally sound. Living in a stress-fi lled, 
urban environment may produce symptoms of both men-
tal illness and crime.223 It is not surprising that mentally 
ill people, forced to live in deteriorated neighborhoods, are 
much more likely to be crime victims than the mentally 
sound.224
A recent Swedish study found that schizophrenic pa-
tients are very likely to live in neighborhoods characterized 
by high levels of disorder, fear of crime, and victimization. 
The association was circular: the presence of large numbers 
of mentally ill people helped increase neighborhood fear, 
leading to neighborhood deterioration, lowered values, and 
the influx of more diagnosed mentally ill people seeking 
cheap housing. Segregating the mentally ill may result in 
worsening of the illness as well as increasing the deteriora-
tion of local areas.225
The link between mental disorder and crime may also 
be related to the treatment of the mentally ill: the police may 
be more likely to arrest the mentally ill, giving the illusion 
that they are crime prone.226 However, some recent research 
by Paul Hirschfi eld and his associates gives only mixed sup-
port to this view. Although some mental health problems 
increase the risk of arrest, others bring out more cautious or 
compassionate police responses that may result in treatment 
rather than arrest.227 Further research is needed to clarify 
this important relationship.
It is also possible that a lack of resources may inhibit 
the mentally ill from obtaining the proper treatment, which, 
if made available, would result in reduced criminality. For 
example, a recent study conducted in North Carolina com-
pared the outcomes for mentally ill patients who received 
outpatient treatment with an untreated comparison group; 
treatment signifi cantly reduced arrest probability (12 per-
cent versus 45 percent).228

ical dilemma of mental health defenses in criminal proceedings.

symptoms, including schizophrenia, paranoia, and obses-
sive behaviors, than male offenders.207 It is not surprising, 
then, that abusive mothers have been found to have mood 
and personality disorders and a history of psychiatric diag-
noses.208 Juvenile murderers have been described in clini-
cal diagnosis as “overtly hostile,” “explosive or volatile,” 
“anxious,” and “depressed.”209 Studies of men accused of 
murder found that 75 percent could be classifi ed as hav-
ing some mental illness, including schizophrenia.210 Also, 
the reported substance abuse among the mentally ill is sig-
nifi cantly higher than that of the general population.211 Kids 
growing up in homes where parents suffer mental illness are 
much more likely to be at risk for family instability, poverty, 
and other factors that are related to future delinquency and 
crime. So not only may mental illness be a cause of crime, 
but its effect may be intergenerational.212
The diagnosed mentally ill appear in arrest and court 
statistics at a rate disproportionate to their presence in the 
population.213 There is also evidence that the mentally ill 
are prone to attack their caregivers: doctors working with 
mental patients are signifi cantly more likely to be attacked 
by patients than any other health care provider.214
Nor is this relationship unique to the United States. 
 Forensic criminologist Henrik Belfrage studied mental pa-
tients in Sweden and found that 40 percent of those dis-
charged from institutional care had a criminal record as 
compared to less than 10 percent of the general pub-
lic.215 Another Swedish study found that about 1 in 20 
serious crimes in that country were committed by people 
with severe mental illness. Australian men diagnosed with 
schizophrenia are four times more likely than the general 
population to be convicted for serious violence.216 And a re-
cent Danish study found a signifi cant positive relationship 
between mental disorders such as schizophrenia and crimi-
nal violence.217 Similarly, a study of German inmates found 
a signifi cant amount of mental illness in both male and fe-
male prisoners.218
In sum, people who suffer psychosis, including paranoid 
or delusional feelings, and who believe others wish them 
harm or that their mind is dominated by forces beyond their 
control, seem to be violence prone.219
The National Mental Health Association (NMHA) 
is the country’s oldest and largest nonprofit 
organization addressing all aspects of mental health and

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  161
These experiences include personally observing others 
acting aggressively to achieve some goal or watching people 
being rewarded for violent acts on television or in mov-
ies. People learn to act aggressively when, as children, they 
model their behavior after the violent acts of adults. Later in 
life, these violent behavior patterns persist in social relation-
ships. For example, the boy who sees his father repeatedly 
strike his mother with impunity is the one most likely to 
grow up to become a battering parent and husband.
Though social learning theorists agree that mental or 
physical traits may predispose a person toward violence, 
they believe that activating a person’s violent tendencies is 
achieved by factors in the environment. The specifi c forms 
that aggressive behavior takes, the frequency with which it 
is expressed, the situations in which it is displayed, and the 
specifi c targets selected for attack are largely determined by 
social learning. However, people are self-aware and engage 
in purposeful learning. Their interpretations of behavior 
outcomes and situations infl uence the way they learn from 
experiences. One adolescent who spends a weekend in jail 
for drunk driving may find it the most awful experience 
of her life—one that teaches her to never drink and drive 
again. Another person, however, may fi nd it an exciting ex-
perience about which he can brag to his friends.
Social Learning and Violence Social learning theorists 
view violence as something learned through a process called 
behavior modeling. In modern society, aggressive acts are 
usually modeled after three principal sources:
Behavioral Theory
Psychological behavior theory maintains that human ac-
tions are developed through learning experiences. Rather 
than focusing on unconscious personality traits or cognitive 
development patterns produced early in childhood, behav-
ior theorists are concerned with the actual behaviors people 
engage in during the course of their daily lives. The major 
premise of behavior theory is that people alter their behav-
ior according to the reactions it receives from others. Behav-
ior is supported by rewards and extinguished by negative 
reactions or punishments. Behavioral theory is quite com-
plex with many different subareas. With respect to criminal 
activity, the behaviorist views crimes, especially violent acts, 
as learned responses to life situations that do not necessarily 
represent psychologically abnormal responses.
Social Learning Theory Social learning is the branch 
of behavior theory most relevant to criminology.229 Social 
learning theorists, most notably Albert Bandura, argue that 
people are not actually born with the ability to act vio-
lently, but that they learn to be aggressive through their life 
experiences.
To read about the life and work of Albert 
Bandura, visit the Criminal Justice CourseMate 
at cengagebrain.com, then access the “Web Links” for 
this chapter.
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) believes 
a person should not be held legally responsible for a 
crime if his or her behavior meets the following stan-
dard developed by legal expert Richard Bonnie:
A person charged with a criminal offense should 
be found not guilty by reason of insanity if it 
is shown that as a result of mental disease or 
mental retardation he was unable to appreciate 
the wrongfulness of his conduct at the time of 
the offense.
As used in this standard, the terms mental disease and mental 
retardation include only those severely abnormal mental condi-
tions that grossly and demonstrably impair a person’s perception 
or understanding of reality and that are not attributable primar-
ily to the voluntary ingestion of alcohol or other psychoactive 
substances.

Mass media. 
 
■
Films and television shows commonly 
depict violence graphically. Moreover, violence is often 
portrayed as an acceptable behavior, especially for he-
roes who never have to face legal consequences for their 
actions.
The Criminological Enterprise feature “Violent Media/
Violent Behavior?” has more on the effects of the media and 
violent behavior.
Social learning theorists have tried to determine what 
triggers violent acts. One position is that a direct, pain-
producing physical assault will usually trigger a violent 
Family interaction. 
 
■
Studies of family life show that ag-
gressive children have parents who use similar tactics 
when dealing with others. For example, the children of 
wife batterers are more likely to use aggressive tactics 
themselves than children in the general population, es-
pecially if the victims (their mothers) suffer psychologi-
cal distress from the abuse.
Environmental experiences. 
 
■
People who reside in areas in 
which violence is a daily occurrence are more likely to 
act violently than those who dwell in low-crime areas 
whose norms stress conventional behavior.
Does the media influence behavior? Does 
broadcast violence cause aggressive be-
havior in viewers? This has become a hot 
topic because of the persistent theme of 
violence on television and in films. Critics 
have called for drastic measures, ranging 
from banning TV violence to putting warn-
ing labels on heavy metal albums out of 
fear that listening to hard-rock lyrics pro-
duces delinquency.
If there is in fact a TV–violence link, the 
problem is indeed alarming: Marketing re-
search indicates that adolescents ages 11 
to 14 view violent horror movies at a higher 
rate than any other age group. Children 
this age use older peers and siblings and 
apathetic parents to gain access to R-rated 
films. Most U.S. households now have 
cable TV, which features violent films and 
shows unavailable on broadcast networks. 
Even children’s programming is saturated 
with violence.
The fact that children watch so much 
violent TV is not surprising considering the 
findings of a well-publicized study con-
ducted by UCLA researchers who found 
that at least 10 network shows made heavy 
use of violence. Of the 161 television mov-
ies monitored (every one that aired that 
season), 23 raised concerns about their 
use of violence, violent theme, violent title, 
or inappropriate portrayals of a scene. Of 
the 118 theatrical films monitored (every 
one that aired that season), 50 raised con-
cerns about their use of violence.
On-air promotions also reflect a continu-
ing, if not worsening, problem. Some series 
may contain several scenes of violence, 
each of which is appropriate within its con-
text. An advertisement for that show, how-
ever, will feature only those violent scenes 
without any of the context. Even some chil-
dren’s television programming had worri-
some signs, featuring “sinister combat” as 
the theme of the show. The characters are 
usually happy to fight and frequently do so 
with little provocation.
There have been numerous anecdotal 
cases of violence linked to TV and films. 
For example, in a famous incident, John 
Hinckley shot President Ronald Reagan 
due to his obsession with actress Jodie 
Foster, which developed after he watched 
her play a prostitute in the violent film Taxi 
Driver. Hinckley viewed the film at least 
15 times.
 While not all experts believe that media 
violence is a direct cause of violent behav-
ior (because if it was, there would be mil-
lions of daily incidents in which viewers 
imitated the aggression they watched on TV 
or in movies), many do agree that media vi-
olence contributes to aggression. Develop-
mental psychologist John Murray carefully 
reviewed existing research on the effect of 
TV violence on children and reached the 
conclusion that viewing media violence 
is related to both short- and long-term in-
creases in aggressive attitudes, values, and 
behaviors; the effects of media violence are 
both real and strong. Similarly, Brad Bush-
man and Craig Anderson have found that 
watching violence on TV is correlated to ag-
gressive behaviors.
There is also evidence that kids who 
watch TV are more likely to persist in aggres-
sive behavior as adults. A recent study con-
ducted by researchers at Columbia University 
found that kids who watch more than an hour 
of TV each day show an increase in assaults, 
fights, robberies, and other acts of aggres-
sion later in life and into adulthood. One rea-
son is that TV viewing may create changes in 
personality and cognition that produce long-
term behavioral changes. Dimitri Christakis 
and his associates found that for every hour 
of television watched daily between the ages 
of 1 and 3, the risk of developing attention 
problems increased by 9 percent over the life 
course; attention problems have been linked 
to antisocial behaviors.
There are several explanations for the 
effects of television and film violence on 
behavior:
Media violence can provide aggressive 
 
■
“scripts” that children store in memory. 
Repeated exposure to these scripts 
can increase their retention and lead to 
changes in attitudes.
Children learn from what they observe. 
 
■
In the same way they learn cognitive and 
social skills from their parents and friends, 
children learn to be violent from television.
Television violence increases the arousal

more prone to act aggressively. Studies

hand—show that viewing violent televi-
sion shows led to increased arousal lev-
els in young children.
Watching television violence promotes 
 
■
such negative attitudes as suspicious-
ness and the expectation that the viewer 
will become involved in violence. Those 
who watch television frequently come to 
view aggression and violence as com-
mon and socially acceptable behavior.
Television violence allows aggressive 
 
■
youths to justify their behavior. It is pos-
sible that, instead of causing violence, 
television helps violent youths rationalize 
their behavior as a socially acceptable 
and common activity.
Television violence may disinhibit ag-
 
■
gressive behavior, which is normally 
controlled by other learning processes. 
Disinhibition takes place when adults 
are viewed as being rewarded for 
violence and when violence is seen as 
socially acceptable. This contradicts 
previous learning experiences in which 
violent behavior was viewed as wrong.
Debating the Media–Violence Link
While this research is quite persuasive, 
not all criminologists accept that watch-
ing TV and movies or playing violent video 
games actually leads to interpersonal vio-
lence. Just because kids who are exposed 
to violent media also engage in violent be-
haviors is not proof of a causal connection. 
It is also possible that kids who are violent 
later seek out violent media: what would we 
expect violent gang boys to watch on TV? 
Hannah Montana? There is little evidence 
that areas that experience the highest lev-
els of violent TV viewing also have rates 
of violent crime that are above the norm. 
Millions of children watch violence every 
night but do not become violent criminals. 
If violent TV shows did, indeed, cause in-
terpersonal violence, then there should be 
few ecological and regional patterns in the 
crime rate, but there are many. Put another 
way, how can regional differences in the 
violence rate be explained considering the 
fact that people all across the nation watch 
the same TV shows and films? Nor can the 
media–violence link explain recent crime 
trends. Despite a rampant increase in vio-
lent TV shows, films, and video games, the 
violence rate among teens has been in a 
significant decline.
One reason for the ongoing debate may 
be that media violence may affect one sub-
set of the population but have relatively little 
effect on others. Sociologist George Com-
stock has identified attributes that make 
some people especially prone to the effects 
of media violence:
Predisposition for aggressive or antiso-
 
■
cial behavior
Rigid or indifferent parenting
 
■
Unsatisfactory social relationships
 
■
Low psychological well-being
 
■
Having been diagnosed as suffering 
 
■
from disruptive behavior disorders 
(DBDs)
So if the impact of media on behavior 
is not in fact universal, it may have the 
greatest effect on those who are the most 
socially and psychologically vulnerable.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Should the government control the con-
tent of TV shows and limit the amount 
of weekly violence? How could the na-
tional news be shown if violence were 
omitted? What about boxing matches 
or hockey games?
 2. How can we explain the fact that mil-
lions of kids watch violent TV shows 
and remain nonviolent? If there is a 
 TV–violence link, how can we explain 
the fact that violence rates may have 
been higher in the Old West than they 
are today? Do you think violent gang 
kids stay home and watch TV shows?

response. Yet the relationship between painful attacks and 
aggressive responses has been found to be inconsistent. 
Whether people counterattack in the face of physical at-
tack depends, in part, on their skill in fi ghting and their 
perception of the strength of their attackers. Verbal taunts 
and insults have also been linked to aggressive responses. 
People who are predisposed to aggression by their learn-
ing experiences are likely to view insults from others as a 
challenge to their social status and to react with violence. 
Still another violence-triggering mechanism is a perceived 
reduction in one’s life conditions. Prime examples of this 
phenomenon are riots and demonstrations in poverty-
stricken ghetto areas. Studies have shown that discontent 
also produces aggression in the more successful members 
of lower-class groups who have been led to believe they 
can succeed but then have been thwarted in their aspira-
tions. While it is still uncertain how this relationship is 
constructed, it is apparently complex. No matter how de-
prived some individuals are, they will not resort to vio-
lence. It seems evident that people’s perceptions of their 
relative deprivation have different effects on their aggres-
sive responses.

to the stage on this continuum at which their moral develop-
ment ceased to grow. Kohlberg and his associates conducted 
studies in which criminals were found to be signifi cantly 
lower in their moral judgment development than noncrimi-
nals of the same social background.232 Since his pioneering 
efforts, researchers have continued to show that criminal of-
fenders are more likely to be classifi ed in the lowest levels 
of moral reasoning (Stages 1 and 2), whereas noncriminals 
have reached a higher stage of moral development (Stages 3 
and 4).233
Recent research indicates that the decision not to com-
mit crimes may be infl uenced by one’s stage of moral de-
velopment. People at the lowest levels report that they are 
deterred from crime because of their fear of sanctions. Those 
in the middle consider the reactions of family and friends. 
Those at the highest stages refrain from crime because they 
believe in duty to others and universal rights.234
Moral development theory suggests that people who 
obey the law simply to avoid punishment or have outlooks 
mainly characterized by self-interest are more likely to com-
mit crimes than those who view the law as something that 
benefi ts all of society. Those at higher stages of moral rea-
soning tend to sympathize with the rights of others and are 
associated with conventional behaviors, such as honesty, 
generosity, and nonviolence. Subsequent research has found 
that a significant number of noncriminals display higher 
stages of moral reasoning than criminals and that engaging 
in criminal behavior leads to reduced levels of moral reason-
ing, which in turn produces more delinquency in a never-
ending loop.235
The deterrent effect of informal sanctions and feelings of 
shame discussed in Chapter 4 may hinge on the level 
of a person’s moral development. The lower one’s state 
of moral development, the less impact informal sanc-
tions may have; increased moral development and infor-
mal sanctions may be better able to control crime.
CONNECTIONS
Information Processing When cognitive theorists who 
study information processing try to explain antisocial be-
havior, they do so in terms of mental perception and how 
people use information to understand their environment. 
When people make decisions, they engage in a sequence of 
cognitive thought processes:
 1. Encode information so that it can be interpreted.
 2. Search for a proper response.
 3. Decide on the most appropriate action.
 4. Act on the decision.236
Not everyone processes information in the same way, 
and the differences in interpretation may explain the devel-
opment of radically different visions of the world.
In summary, social learning theorists have said that the 
following four factors may contribute to violent and/or ag-
gressive behavior:
An event that heightens arousal. 
 
■
Such as a person frustrat-
ing or provoking another through physical assault or 
verbal abuse.
Aggressive skills. 
 
■
Learned aggressive responses picked up 
from observing others, either personally or through the 
media.
Expected outcomes. 
 
■
The belief that aggression will some-
how be rewarded. Rewards can come in the form of re-
ducing tension or anger, gaining some fi nancial reward, 
building self-esteem, or gaining the praise of others.
Consistency of behavior with values. 
 
■
The belief, gained 
from observing others, that aggression is justifi ed and 
appropriate, given the circumstances of the current 
situation.
Cognitive Theory
One area of psychology that has received increasing recog-
nition in recent years has been the cognitive school. Psy-
chologists with a cognitive perspective focus on mental 
processes and how people perceive and mentally represent 
the world around them and solve problems. The pioneers 
of this school were Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), Edward 
Titchener (1867–1927), and William James (1842–1920). 
Today, there are several subdisciplines within the cognitive 
area. The moral development branch is concerned with the 
way people morally represent and reason about the world. 
Humanistic psychology stresses self-awareness and “get-
ting in touch with feelings.” The information processing
branch focuses on the way people process, store, encode, 
retrieve, and manipulate information to make decisions and 
solve problems.
Moral and Intellectual Development Theory The moral 
and intellectual development branch of cognitive psychol-
ogy is perhaps the most important for criminological the-
ory. Jean Piaget (1896–1980), the founder of this approach, 
hypothesized that people’s reasoning processes develop in 
an orderly fashion, beginning at birth and continuing until 
they are 12 years old and older.230 At fi rst, children respond 
to the environment in a simple manner, seeking interesting 
objects and developing their refl exes. By the fourth and fi nal 
stage, the formal operations stage, they have developed into 
mature adults who can use logic and abstract thought.
Lawrence Kohlberg fi rst applied the concept of moral 
development to issues in criminology.231 He found that 
people travel through stages of moral development during 
which their decisions and judgments on issues of right and 
wrong are made for different reasons. It is possible that seri-
ous offenders have a moral orientation that differs from that 
of law-abiding citizens. Kohlberg classifi ed people according

emphasize aggressive responses are repeatedly rehearsed as 
the child matures.248
To violence-prone kids, people seem more aggressive 
than they actually are and seem to intend them ill when 
there is no reason for alarm. According to information pro-
cessing theory, as these children mature, they use fewer cues 
than most people to process information. Some use violence 
in a calculating fashion as a means of getting what they 
want; others react in an overly volatile fashion to the slight-
est provocation. Aggressors are more likely to be vigilant, 
on edge, or suspicious. When they attack victims, they may 
believe they are defending themselves, even though they are 
misreading the situation.249
Adolescents who use violence as a coping technique with 
others are also more likely to exhibit other social problems, 
such as drug and alcohol abuse.250 There is also evidence 
that delinquent boys who engage in theft are more likely to 
exhibit cognitive defi cits than nondelinquent youth. For ex-
ample, they have a poor sense of time, leaving them incapa-
ble of dealing with or solving social problems in an effective 
manner.251 Information processing theory has been used to 
explain the occurrence of date rape. Sexually violent males 
believe that when their dates say no to sexual advances the 
women are really “playing games” and actually want to be 
taken forcefully.252
Errors in cognition and information processing have 
been used to explain the behavior of child abusers. Distorted 
thinking patterns abusers express include the following:
According to this cognitive approach, people who use 
information properly, who are better conditioned to make 
reasoned judgments, and who can make quick and reasoned 
decisions when facing emotion-laden events are the ones 
best able to avoid antisocial behavior choices.237 In contrast, 
crime-prone people may have cognitive deficits and use 
information incorrectly when they make decisions.238 Law 
violators may lack the ability to perform cognitive functions 
in a normal and orderly fashion.239 Some may be sensation 
seekers who are constantly looking for novel experiences, 
whereas others lack deliberation and rarely think through 
problems. Some may give up easily, whereas others act with-
out thinking when they get upset.240
People with inadequate cognitive processing perceive 
the world as stacked against them; they believe they have 
little control over the negative events in their life.241 Chronic 
offenders come to believe that crime is an appropriate means 
to satisfy their immediate personal needs, which take pre-
cedence over more distant social needs such as obedience 
to the law.242 They have a distorted view of the world that 
shapes their thinking and colors their judgments. Because 
they have diffi culty making the right decision while under 
stress, they pursue behaviors that they perceive as benefi -
cial and satisfying, but that turn out to be harmful and det-
rimental.243 They may take aggressive action because they 
wrongly believe that a situation demands forceful responses 
when it actually does not. They fi nd it diffi cult to under-
stand or sympathize with other people’s feelings and emo-
tions, which leads them to blame their 
victims for their problems.244 Thus, the 
sexual offender believes his target ei-
ther led him on or secretly wanted the 
forcible sex to occur: “She was asking 
for it.”245
Shaping Perceptions People whose 
cognitive processes are skewed or 
faulty may be relying on mental scripts 
learned in childhood that tell them how 
to interpret events, what to expect, how 
they should react, and what the out-
come of the interaction should be.246 
Hostile children may have learned im-
proper scripts by observing how oth-
ers react to events; their own parents’ 
aggressive and inappropriate behavior 
would have considerable impact. Some 
may have had early and prolonged ex-
posure to violence (for example, child 
abuse), which increases their sensitiv-
ity to slights and maltreatment. Over-
sensitivity to rejection by their peers is 
a continuation of sensitivity to rejection 
by their parents.247 Violent behavior re-
sponses learned in childhood become a 
stable behavior because the scripts that

Zachariah Blanton, 17, is led into the Jackson County Courthouse in Brownstown, Indiana, 
by sheriff’s deputies on July 26, 2006. Blanton was tried on charges of murder, attempted 
murder, and criminal recklessness for a series of highway shootings that killed a man in 
southern Indiana. Blanton had been on a hunting trip with relatives but got into an argument 
and drove off in anger shortly before the attacks. He drove to a nearby overpass, aimed his 
rifle over the trunk of his vehicle, and fired at trucks on Interstate 65. Can such incidents of 
random and seemingly unprovoked violence be a product of watching too much violent media 
in which shooting is made to look routine and ordinary?

with psychological problems and the development of anti-
social behavior trends. Two of the most critical— personality 
and intelligence—are discussed in detail in the following 
sections.
Personality and Crime
Personality can be defi ned as the reasonably stable patterns 
of behavior, including thoughts and emotions, that distin-
guish one person from another.257 One’s personality refl ects 
a characteristic way of adapting to life’s demands and prob-
lems. The way we behave is a function of how our personal-
ity enables us to interpret life events and make appropriate 
behavioral choices. Can the cause of crime be linked to 
personality?
The association between personality traits and crime 
has a long history. Sheldon Glueck and Eleanor Glueck 
Child as a sexual being
 
■
. Children are perceived as being 
able to and wanting to engage in sexual activity with 
adults.253
Nature of harm
 
■
. The offender perceives that sexual activ-
ity does not cause harm (and may in fact be benefi cial) 
to the child.
Entitlement
 
■
. The child abuser perceives that he is supe-
rior and more important than others and hence is able 
to have sex with whomever and whenever he wants.
Dangerous world
 
■
. An offender perceives that others are 
abusive and rejecting, and he must fi ght to be safe.
Uncontrollable.
 
■
 The world is perceived as uncontrollable, 
and circumstances are outside of his control.
Treatment based on how people process information 
takes into account that people are more likely to respond 
aggressively to a provocation because thoughts tend to in-
tensify the insult or otherwise stir feelings of anger. Cogni-
tive therapists, during the course of treatment, attempt to 
teach explosive people to control aggressive impulses by 
viewing social provocations as problems demanding a solu-
tion rather than retaliation. Programs are aimed at teaching 
problem-solving skills that may include self-disclosure, role-
playing, listening, following instructions, joining in, and us-
ing self-control.254
Therapeutic interventions designed to make people 
better problem solvers may involve such measures as (a) 
enhancing coping and problem-solving skills; (b) enhanc-
ing relationships with peers, parents, and other adults; 
(c) teaching confl ict resolution and communication skills 
and methods for resisting peer pressure related to drug use 
and violence; (d) teaching consequential thinking and de-
cision-making abilities; (e) modeling prosocial behaviors, 
including cooperation with others, self-responsibility, re-
specting others, and public speaking effi cacy; and (f) teach-
ing empathy.255
Treatment interventions based on learning social skills 
are relatively new, but there are some indications that this 
approach can have long-term benefi ts for reducing criminal 
behavior.256
The various psychological theories of crime are set out 
in Concept Summary 5.2.
PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAITS 
AND CHARACTERISTICS
In addition to creating theories of behavior and develop-
ment, psychologists also study psychological traits and char-
acteristics that defi ne an individual and shape how he or she 
functions in the world. Certain traits have become associated 
CONCEPT SUMMARY 5.2
Psychological Trait Theories
Psychodynamic
The major premise of the theory is that the development of 
 
■
the unconscious personality early in childhood influences 
behavior for the rest of the person’s life. Criminals have weak 
egos and damaged personalities.
The strengths of the theory are that it explains the onset of 
 
■
crime and why crime and drug abuse cut across class lines.
The research focuses of the theory are on mental disorders, 
 
■
personality development, and unconscious motivations and 
drives.
Behavioral
The major premise of the theory is that people commit crime 
 
■
when they model their behavior after others they see being 
rewarded for similar acts. Behavior is reinforced by rewards 
and extinguished by punishment.
The strengths of the theory are that it explains the role of 
 
■
significant others in the crime process; it shows how the 
media can influence crime and violence.
The research focuses of the theory are the media and 
 
■
violence, as well as the effects of child abuse.
Cognitive
The major premise of the theory is that individual reasoning 
 
■
processes influence behavior. Reasoning is influenced by the 
way people perceive their environment.
The strengths of the theory are that it shows why criminal 
 
■
behavior patterns change over time as people mature and 
develop their reasoning powers. It may explain the aging-out 
process.
The research focuses of the theory are perception and 
 
■
cognition.

disorder, the greater the likelihood that the individual will 
engage in serious and repeated antisocial acts.264 Take for 
instance sadistic personality disorder, defined as a re-
peating pattern of cruel and demeaning behavior. People 
suffering from this type of extreme personality disturbance 
seem prone to engage in serious violent attacks, including 
homicides motivated by sexual sadism.265
The Antisocial Personality The Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) de-
fi nes the antisocial personality as a pervasive pattern of dis-
regard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins 
in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adult-
hood. In addition, those suffering from this disease usually 
exhibit at least three of the following behaviors:
Failure to conform to social norms with respect to law-
 
■
ful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts 
that are grounds for arrest
Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeatedly lying, use of 
 
■
aliases, or conning others for personal profi t or pleasure
Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead
 
■
Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated 
 
■
physical fi ghts or assaults
Reckless disregard for safety of self or others
 
■
Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated 
 
■
failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor 
fi nancial obligations
Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to 
 
■
or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from 
another266
The terms psychopath and sociopath are commonly 
used to describe people who have an antisocial personality 
(though the APA considers the terms antiquated and obso-
lete). People with these traits have been involved in some of 
the nation’s most notorious crimes (see the accompanying 
Profi les in Crime feature).
Though these terms are often used interchangeably, some 
psychologists distinguish between sociopaths and psycho-
paths, suggesting that the former are a product of a destruc-
tive home environment whereas the latter are a product of 
an inherited genetic defect.267 This condition is discussed in 
The Criminological Enterprise feature “The Psychopath” on 
page 170.
Research on Personality Since maintaining a deviant per-
sonality has been related to crime and delinquency, numer-
ous attempts have been made to devise accurate measures 
of personality and determine whether they can predict anti-
social behavior. One of the most widely used psychological 
tests is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, 
commonly called the MMPI. This test has subscales de-
signed to measure many different personality traits, includ-
ing psychopathic deviation (Pd scale), schizophrenia (Sc), 
identifi ed a number of personality traits that they believe 
characterize antisocial youth:258
self-assertiveness 
lack of concern for
defi ance 
others
extroversion 
feeling unappreciated
ambivalence 
distrust of authority
impulsiveness 
poor personal skills
narcissism 
mental instability
suspicion 
hostility
destructiveness 
resentment
sadism 
The Glueck research is representative of the view that 
antisocial people maintain a distinct set of personal 
traits, which makes them particularly sensitive to 
 environmental stimuli. Once dismissed by mainstream 
criminologists, the section on life course theories in 
Chapter 9 shows how the Gluecks’ views still infl uence 
contemporary criminological theory.
CONNECTIONS
Psychologist Hans Eysenck linked personality to crime 
when he identifi ed two traits that he associated with antiso-
cial behavior: extroversion-introversion and stability-instabil-
ity. Extreme introverts are overaroused and avoid sources of 
stimulation; in contrast, extreme extroverts are unaroused 
and seek sensation. Introverts are slow to learn and be con-
ditioned; extroverts are impulsive individuals who lack the 
ability to examine their own motives and behaviors. Those 
who are unstable, a condition Eysenck calls “neuroticism,” 
are anxious, tense, and emotionally unstable.259 People 
who are both neurotic and extroverted lack self-insight and 
are impulsive and emotionally unstable; they are unlikely 
to have reasoned judgments of life events. While extrovert 
neurotics may act self-destructively (e.g., abusing drugs), 
more stable people will be able to reason that such behav-
ior is ultimately harmful and life threatening. Eysenck be-
lieves that personality is controlled by genetic factors and 
is heritable.
A number of research efforts have found an association 
between the personality traits identified by Eysenck and 
repeat and chronic criminal offending.260 Other suspected 
traits include impulsivity, hostility, and aggressiveness.261
Callous, unemotional traits in very young children can be 
a warning sign for future psychopathy and antisocial behav-
ior.262 Personality defects have been linked not only to ag-
gressive antisocial behaviors such as assault and rape, but 
also to white-collar and business crimes.263
According to this view, the personality is the key to 
understanding antisocial behavior. The more severe the

ferred to as the “Preppie Murder Case,” it 
became one of the most notorious murders 
in New York City history. The case dragged 
on for two years before trial and while the 
jury deadlocked for nine days, Chambers 
decided to plead guilty in exchange for a 
sentence of 5 to 15 years in prison.
What the jury did not know was that 
between his arrest and trial Chambers was 
out and about, attending parties and having 
a grand time. At one event, a friend taped 
Chambers as he put on a woman’s wig and 
choked himself with his own hands as he 
gagged loudly. He picked up a doll and 
twisted its neck. Chambers spoke in a high 
female voice as he said, “My name is . . .” 
The head of the doll suddenly came off the 
body. “Oops,” he said in a maniacal voice, 
“I think I killed it!”
The public was shocked when the out-
rageous tape was played on TV and opinion 
turned against Chambers. All of a sudden, 
people realized how incredible it was to be-
lieve that Chambers had been attacked by 
Jennifer Levin, who stood 5’3” and weighed 
120 pounds. Levin’s mother mounted a 
campaign to keep Chambers behind bars, 
and he served the maximum sentence, 
15 years. After release in 2003, he led a 
dissolute life, dealing drugs with an old girl-
friend until busted by an undercover agent. 
On August 11, 2008, Chambers pleaded 
guilty to selling drugs. On September 2, 
2008, he was sentenced to 19 years on the 
drug charges.
Jennifer Levin had the misfortune of 
running into a young man who displayed 
many of the characteristics of the clas-
sic sociopath/psychopath. He was callous, 
lacked empathy, was constantly involved in 
antisocial activities, and experienced un-
controlled rage. He did not learn from his 
mistakes because he could never believe 
he made any; Jennifer Levin’s death was 
her fault and not his.

The Preppie Murder Case
Her friends described Jennifer Levin as out-
going, pretty, and having a good sense of 
style. She may have had her wild side, gain-
ing entrance to the New York club scene 
though she was only 17 years old. It was 
at a club called Dorrian’s that she spot-
ted Robert Chambers. Standing 6’4” and 
weighing 200 pounds, movie-star-hand-
some Chambers seemed like the ideal man. 
What Levin and her friends didn’t realize 
was that Chambers had his own dark side, 
doing poorly in school, committing burglar-
ies, and selling and using drugs. He had 
attended Boston University, but got kicked 
out when he stole someone’s credit card.
On the night of August 25, 1986, he 
hooked up with an adoring Jennifer Levin

and hypomania (Ma).268 Research studies have detected an 
association between scores on the Pd scale and criminal in-
volvement.269 Another frequently administered personality 
test, the  California Personality Inventory (CPI), has also 
been used to distinguish deviants from nondeviant groups.270 
The  Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) 
allows researchers to assess such personality traits as control, 
aggression, alienation, and well-being.271 Evaluations using 
this scale indicate that adolescent offenders who are crime 
prone maintain “negative emotionality,” a tendency to experi-
ence aversive affective states, such as anger, anxiety, and irrita-
bility. They also are predisposed to weak personal constraints, 
and they have diffi culty controlling impulsive behavior urges. 
Because they are both impulsive and aggressive, crime-prone 
people are quick to take action against perceived threats.
Evidence that personality traits predict crime and vio-
lence is important because it suggests that the root cause 
of crime can be found in the forces that infl uence human 
development at an early stage of life. If these results are 
valid, rather than focus on job creation and neighborhood 
improvement, crime control efforts might be better focused 
on helping families raise children who are reasoned and re-
fl ective and enjoy a safe environment.
Intelligence and Crime
Intelligence refers to a person’s ability to reason, compre-
hend ideas, solve problems, think abstractly, understand 
complex ideas, learn from experience, and discover solutions

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  169
criminals, these scores may refl ect criminals’ cultural back-
ground, not their mental ability. Studies challenging the 
assumption that people automatically committed crimi-
nal acts because they had below-average IQs began to ap-
pear as early as the 1920s. In 1926, John Slawson studied 
1,543 delinquent boys in New York institutions and com-
pared them with a control group of New York City boys.275
Slawson found that although 80 percent of the delinquents 
achieved lower scores in abstract verbal intelligence, delin-
quents were about normal in mechanical aptitude and non-
verbal intelligence. These results indicated the possibility 
of cultural bias in portions of the IQ tests. He also found 
that there was no relationship between the number of ar-
rests, the types of offenses, and IQ.
Though many early criminologists believed there was a 
link between intelligence and crime, in 1931, Edwin Suther-
land evaluated IQ studies of criminals and delinquents and 
noted signifi cant variation in the fi ndings, which disproved 
any notion that criminals were “feebleminded.”276 The 
IQ–crime link was all but forgotten in the criminological 
literature.
More than 40 years later, the respected criminologists 
Travis Hirschi and Michael Hindelang resurrected the IQ–
crime debate. They reexamined existing research data and 
concluded that the weight of evidence shows that IQ is a 
more important factor than race and socioeconomic class 
for predicting criminal and delinquent involvement.277 Re-
jecting the notion that IQ tests are race and class biased, 
they concluded that major differences exist between crimi-
nals and noncriminals within similar racial and socioeco-
nomic class categories. They proposed the idea that low IQ 
increases the likelihood of criminal behavior through its ef-
fect on school performance. That is, youths with low IQs do 
poorly in school, and school failure and academic incom-
petence are highly related to delinquency and later to adult 
criminality.
Hirschi and Hindelang’s inferences have been supported 
by research conducted by both U.S. and international schol-
ars.278 The Bell Curve, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Mur-
ray’s influential albeit controversial book on intelligence, 
comes down fi rmly for an IQ–crime link. Their extensive 
review of the available literature shows that people with 
lower IQs are more likely to commit crime, get caught, and 
be sent to prison.279
Some studies have found a direct IQ–delinquency link 
among samples of adolescent boys.280 When Alex Piquero 
examined violent behavior among groups of children in 
Philadelphia, he found that scores on intelligence tests were 
the best predictors of violent behavior and could be used 
to distinguish between groups of violent and nonviolent of-
fenders.281 Others fi nd that the IQ–crime link is an indi-
rect one: low intelligence leads to poor school performance, 
which enhances the chances of criminality.282 The IQ–crime 
relationship has also been found in cross-national studies 
conducted in a number of countries, including Sweden, 
Denmark, and Canada.283
to complex problems. It was long believed that people who 
maintain a below-average intelligence quotient (IQ) were at 
risk to criminality. Criminals were believed to have inherently 
substandard intelligence, and thus, they seemed naturally in-
clined to commit more crimes than more intelligent persons. 
Furthermore, it was thought that if authorities could determine 
which individuals had low IQs, they might identify potential 
criminals before they committed socially harmful acts.
Social scientists had a captive group of subjects in juve-
nile training schools and penal institutions, and they began 
to measure the correlation between IQ and crime by testing 
adjudicated offenders. Thus, inmates of penal institutions 
were used as a test group around which numerous theories 
about intelligence were built, leading ultimately to the na-
ture-versus-nurture controversy that is still going on today. 
These concepts are discussed in some detail in the following 
sections.
Nature Theory Nature theory argues that intelligence 
is largely determined genetically, that ancestry determines 
IQ, and that low intelligence, as demonstrated by low IQ, is 
linked to criminal behavior. When the newly developed IQ 
tests were administered to inmates of prisons and juvenile 
training schools in the fi rst decades of the twentieth century, 
the nature position gained support because a very large pro-
portion of the inmates scored low on the tests. During his 
studies in 1920, Henry Goddard found that many institu-
tionalized persons were what he considered “feebleminded”; 
he concluded that at least half of all juvenile delinquents 
were mental defectives.272 In 1926, William Healy and Au-
gusta Bronner tested groups of delinquent boys in Chicago 
and Boston and found that 37 percent were subnormal in 
intelligence. They concluded that delinquents were fi ve to 
ten times more likely to be mentally defi cient than normal 
boys.273 These and other early studies were embraced as 
proof that low IQ scores identifi ed potentially delinquent 
children and that a correlation existed between innate low 
intelligence and deviant behavior. IQ tests were believed 
to measure the inborn genetic makeup of individuals, and 
many criminologists accepted the idea that individuals with 
substandard IQs were predisposed toward delinquency and 
adult criminality.
Nurture Theory The rise of culturally sensitive explana-
tions of human behavior in the 1930s led to the nurture 
school of intelligence. Nurture theory states that intel-
ligence must be viewed as partly biological but primarily 
sociological. Because intelligence is not inherited, low-IQ 
parents do not necessarily produce low-IQ children.274
Nurture theorists discredited the notion that people commit 
crimes because they have low IQs. Instead, they postulated 
that environmental stimulation from parents, relatives, so-
cial contacts, schools, peer groups, and innumerable  others 
create a child’s IQ level and that low IQs result from an 
environment that also encourages delinquent and crimi-
nal behavior. Thus, if low IQ scores are recorded among

tests, and members of that group are also the ones most 
likely to commit crime. The low IQ–crime association is 
spurious: people who suffer disadvantages such as pov-
erty and limited educational resources do poorly on 
IQ tests and also commit crime.
The measurement of intelligence is often varied and hap-
 
■
hazard, and results may depend on the particular method 
used. The correlation between intelligence and antisocial 
behavior using IQ tests as a measure of aptitude is slight; 
it is stronger if attendance in special programs or special 
schools is used as an indicator of intellectual ability.286
People with low IQs are stigmatized and negatively 
 
■
labeled by middle-class decision makers such as 
IQ and Crime Reconsidered The Hirschi-Hindelang re-
search increased interest and research on the association be-
tween IQ and crime, but the issue is far from settled and is still 
a matter of signifi cant debate. While the studies cited above 
found an IQ–crime association, others suggest that IQ level 
has negligible infl uence on criminal behavior.284 An evaluation 
of existing knowledge on intelligence conducted by the Amer-
ican Psychological Association concluded that the strength of 
an IQ–crime link was “very low.”285 Those who question the 
IQ–crime link suggest that any association may be based on 
spurious data and inadequate research methodologies:
IQ tests are biased and refl ect middle class values. As a 
 
■
result, socially disadvantaged people do poorly on IQ 
their misdeeds. When they commit antiso-
cial acts, they are less likely to feel shame or 
empathize with their victims.
Hervey Cleckley, a leading authority on 
psychopathy, described them as follows:
[Psychopaths are] chronically 
antisocial individuals who are 
always in trouble, profi ting neither 
from experience nor punishment, 
and maintaining no real loyalties 
to any person, group, or code. 
They are frequently callous and 
hedonistic, showing marked 
emotional immaturity, with lack of 
responsibility, lack of judgment and 
an ability to rationalize their behavior 
so that it appears warranted, 
reasonable and justifi ed.
Considering these personality traits, it is 
not surprising that research studies show 
that people evaluated as psychopaths are 
significantly more prone to criminal and 
violent behavior when compared to nonpsy-
chopathic control groups. Psychopaths 
tend to continue their criminal careers long 
after other offenders burn out or age out of 
crime. They are continually in trouble with 
the law and, therefore, are likely to wind up 
in penal institutions. After reviewing avail-
able data, forensic psychologist James 
Blair and his colleagues conclude that ap-
proximately 15 to 25 percent of U.S. prison 
inmates meet diagnostic criteria for psy-
chopathy. Once they are released, former 
inmates who suffer from psychopathy are 
three times more likely to reoffend within 
a year of release than other prisoners, and 
four times more likely to reoffend violently.
The Cause of Psychopathy
Though psychologists are still not certain 
of the cause of psychopathy, a number 
of factors are believed to contribute to its 
development.
Traumatic Socialization
Some explanations focus on family experi-
ences, suggesting that the influence of an 
unstable parent, parental rejection, lack 
of love during childhood, and inconsistent 
discipline may be related to psychopathy. 
Children who lack the opportunity to form 
an attachment to a mother figure in the 
first three years of life, who suffer sudden 
separation from the mother figure, or who 
see changes in the mother figure are most 
likely to develop psychopathic personali-
ties. According to this view, the path runs 
from antisocial parenting to psychopathy 
to criminality. Psychologist David Lykken 
suggests that psychopaths have an in-
herited “low fear quotient,” which inhibits 
their fear of punishment. All people have 
a natural or innate fear of certain stimuli, 
such as spiders, snakes, fires, or strang-
ers. Psychopaths, as a rule, have few fears. 
Normal socialization processes depend 
on punishing antisocial behavior to inhibit 
future transgressions. Someone who does 
not fear punishment is simply harder to 
socialize.
The Psychopath
Some violent offenders may have a dis-
turbed character structure commonly re-
ferred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or 
antisocial personality. Although they may 
exhibit superficial charm and above-average 
intelligence, this often masks a disturbed 
personality that makes them incapable of 
forming enduring relationships with others 
and continually involves them in such devi-
ant behaviors as violence, risk taking, sub-
stance abuse, and impulsivity.
From an early age, many psychopaths 
have had home lives that were filled with 
frustration, bitterness, and quarreling. An-
tisocial youths exhibit low levels of guilt and 
anxiety and persistently violate the rights 
of others. Their intelligence may alter their 
criminal career development, and render 
it quite different from that of nonpsycho-
pathic criminals; high intelligence appears 
to enhance the destructive potential of a 
psychopath, while intelligence may mediate 
the criminality of the nonpsychopath.
As a result of this instability and frustra-
tion, these individuals developed person-
alities that became unreliable, unstable, 
demanding, and egocentric. Most psycho-
paths are risk-taking, sensation seekers who 
are constantly involved in a garden variety 
of antisocial behaviors. Some may become 
almost addicted to thrill seeking, resulting in 
repeated and dangerous risky behaviors. They 
are often described as grandiose, egocentric, 
manipulative, forceful, and cold-hearted, with 
shallow emotions and the inability to feel re-
morse, empathy with others, or anxiety over

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  171
Maintaining a low IQ may infl uence some criminal 
 
■
patterns, such as arson and sex crimes, but not others, 
further clouding the waters.287
Even if it can be shown that known offenders have 
lower IQs than the general population, it is difficult to 
explain many patterns in the crime rate. Why are there 
more male than female criminals? (Are females smarter 
than males?) Why do crime rates vary by region, time 
of year, and even weather patterns? Why does aging out 
occur? IQs do not increase with age, so why should crime 
rates fall?
 police offi cers, teachers, and guidance counselors. It is not 
a low IQ that causes criminal behavior, but the reaction to 
negative labels: alienation, stigma, and resentment.
Research using offi cial record data may be fl awed. It’s 
 
■
possible that criminals with high IQ are better able to 
avoid detection and punishment than low-IQ people. 
Research using data from arrestees may omit the more 
intelligent members of the criminal subclass. And even 
if they are caught, high-IQ offenders are less likely to be 
convicted and punished. Because their favorable treat-
ment helps higher-IQ offenders avoid the pains of crim-
inal punishment, it lessens their chances of recidivism.
that part of the brain that plays a crucial role 
in processing emotions. As James Blair and 
his colleagues suggest, amygdala dysfunc-
tion gives rise to impairments in aversive 
conditioning, instrumental learning, and the 
processing of fearful and sad expressions. 
These impairments interfere with socializa-
tion; people with impaired amygdalea do 
not learn to avoid actions that cause harm 
to other individuals. Because of this defi-
ciency, psychopaths have problems dis-
tinguishing and processing people’s facial 
expressions. When Quentin Deeley and his 
colleagues compared facial recognition abil-
ity of psychopaths with a control group, they 
found that the former were significantly less 
likely to recognize and emotionally respond 
to facial and other signals of distress. This 
inability may help explain the lack of emo-
tional empathy observed among people with 
antisocial personalities.
Chronic Offending
The antisocial personality concept seems 
to jibe with what is known about chronic 
offending. As many as 80 percent of these 
high-end chronic offenders exhibit socio-
pathic behavior patterns. Though com-
prising about 4 percent of the total male 
population and less than 1 percent of the 
total female population, they are responsible 
for half of all serious felony offenses com-
mitted annually. Not all high-rate chronic of-
fenders are sociopaths, but enough are to 
support a strong link between personality 
dysfunction and long-term criminal careers.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Should people diagnosed as psycho-
paths be separated and treated even if 
they have not yet committed a crime?
 2. Should psychopathic murderers be 
spared the death penalty because 
they lack the capacity to control their 
behavior?

Neurological Disorder
Psychopaths may suffer from lower than 
normal levels of arousal. Research stud-
ies show that psychopaths have lower 
skin conductance levels and fewer spon-
taneous responses than normal subjects. 
There may be a link between psychopathy 
and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dys-
function. The ANS mediates physiological 
activities associated with emotions and 
is manifested in such measurements as 
heartbeat rate, blood pressure, respiration, 
muscle tension, capillary size, and elec-
trical activity of the skin (called galvanic 
skin resistance). Psychopaths may be less 
capable of regulating their activities than 
other people. While some people may be-
come anxious and afraid when facing the 
prospect of committing a criminal act, 
psychopaths in the same circumstances 
feel no such fear. James Ogloff and Ste-
phen Wong conclude that their reduced 
anxiety levels result in behaviors that are 
more impulsive and inappropriate and 
in deviant behavior, apprehension, and 
incarceration.
Brain Structure
Another view is that psychopathy is related 
to abnormal brain structures. Consequently, 
psychopaths may need greater than aver-
age stimulation to bring them up to com-
fortable levels (similar to arousal theory, dis-
cussed earlier).
Another view is that psychopathy is 
bound up in an impairment of the amygdala,

primary prevention programs that seek to treat personal 
problems before they manifest themselves as crime. To this 
end, thousands of family therapy organizations, substance 
abuse clinics, and mental health associations operate 
throughout the United States. Teachers, employers, rela-
tives, welfare agencies, and others make referrals to these 
facilities. These services are based on the premise that if 
a person’s problems can be treated before they become 
overwhelming, some future crimes will be prevented. Sec-
ondary prevention programs provide treatment such as 
psychological counseling to youths and adults who are at 
risk for law violation. Tertiary prevention programs may 
be a requirement of a probation order, part of a diversion-
ary sentence, or aftercare at the end of a prison sentence.
Biologically oriented therapy is also being used in the 
criminal justice system. Programs have altered diets, changed 
lighting, compensated for learning disabilities, treated aller-
gies, and so on.288 More controversial has been the use of 
mood-altering chemicals, such as lithium, pemoline, imip-
ramine, phenytoin, and benzodiazepines, to control behav-
ior. Another practice that has elicited concern is the use of 
psychosurgery (brain surgery) to control antisocial behav-
ior. Surgical procedures have been used to alter the brain 
structure of convicted sex offenders in an effort to eliminate 
or control their sex drives. Results are still preliminary, but 
some critics argue that these procedures are without scien-
tifi c merit.289
Numerous psychologically based treatment methods 
range from individual counseling to behavior modifi cation. 
For example, treatment based on how people process infor-
mation takes into account that people are more likely to re-
spond aggressively to provocation if thoughts intensify the 
insult or otherwise stir feelings of anger. Cognitive thera-
pists attempt to teach explosive people to control aggres-
sive impulses by viewing social provocations as problems 
demanding a solution rather than retaliation. Therapeutic 
interventions designed to make people better problem solv-
ers may involve measures that enhance:

While some research shows that people who act aggressively in social 
settings also have lower IQ scores than their peers, other findings 
suggest that the association between intelligence and crime is 
insignificant. Should mentally challenged offenders be punished in 
the same manner as those who are not intellectually impaired? Here,

CHAPTER 5 | Trait Theories  173
 1. Be familiar with the develop-
ment of trait theory
The view that criminals have 
 
■
physical or mental traits that 
make them different began with 
the Italian physician and crimi-
nologist Cesare Lombroso. In the 
early 1970s, spurred by the pub-
lication of Sociobiology: The New 
Synthesis, by Edmund O. Wil-
son, biological explanations of 
crime once again emerged. Trait 
theorists today recognize that 
crime-producing interactions 
involve both personal traits and 
environmental factors. If only a 
few offenders become persistent 
repeaters, what sets them apart 
from the rest of the criminal 
population may be some crime-
producing trait.
 2. Discuss the biochemical condi-
tions that produce crime
Biochemical conditions infl u-
 
■
ence antisocial behavior. Bio-
criminologists maintain that an 
improper diet can cause chemi-
cal and mineral imbalance and 
lead to cognitive and learning 
defi cits and problems, and 
these factors in turn are associ-
ated with antisocial behaviors. 
Abnormal levels of male sex 
hormones (androgens) can pro-
duce aggressive behavior. Ex-
posure to lead has been linked 
to emotional and behavioral 
disorders.
 3. Be familiar with the neurophysi-
ological conditions associated 
with crime
Inherited or acquired neurolog-
 
■
ical and physical abnormalities 
control behavior throughout the 
life span. Neurological impair-
ment may also lead to the de-
velopment of personality traits 
linked to antisocial behaviors. 
According to arousal theory, a 
need for high levels of environ-
mental stimulation may lead 
to aggressive, violent behavior 
patterns.
 4. Link genetics to crime
Another biosocial theme is that 
 
■
the human traits associated 
with criminality have a genetic 
basis. According to this view, 
(1) antisocial behavior is inher-
ited, (2) the genetic makeup 
of parents is passed on to chil-
dren, and (3) genetic abnor-
mality is linked to a variety of 
antisocial behaviors.
 5. Explain the evolutionary view 
of crime
Human traits that produce vio-
 
■
lence and aggression have been 
advanced by the long process 
of human evolution. According 
to evolutionary theory, behavior 
patterns are inherited, impul-
sive behavior becomes inter-
generational, passed down from 
parents to children.
 6. Discuss the elements of the 
psychodynamic perspective
The id is the primitive part of 
 
■
people’s mental makeup, the 
ego is shaped by learning and 
experience, and the superego 
refl ects the morals and values of 
parents and signifi cant others. 
Criminals are id-driven people 
who suffer from weak or dam-
aged egos. Crime is a manifesta-
tion of feelings of oppression 
and the inability to develop the 
proper psychological defenses 
and rationales to keep these 
feelings under control.
 7. Link behavioral theory to crime
People are not born with the 
 
■
ability to act violently; rather, 
they learn to be aggressive 
through their life experiences. 
These experiences include per-
sonally observing others acting 
aggressively to achieve some 
goal or observing people being 
rewarded for violent acts.
 8. Know the cognitive processes 
related to crime
Crime-prone people may have 
 
■
cognitive defi cits and use in-
formation incorrectly when 
they make decisions. They 
view crime as an appropriate 
means to satisfy their immedi-
ate personal needs, which take 
precedence over more distant 
social needs such as obedience 
to the law.
 9. Discuss the elements of person-
ality related to crime
Sociopathic, psychopathic, or 
 
■
antisocial people cannot empa-
thize with others, and are short-
sighted and hedonistic. These 
traits make them prone to 
problems ranging from psycho-
pathology to drug abuse, sexual 
promiscuity, and violence. 
Factors related to personality 
problems include improper 
socialization, having a psycho-
pathic parent, experiencing pa-
rental rejection and lack of love 
during childhood, and receiving 
inconsistent discipline.
 10. Be aware of the controversy 
over the association between in-
telligence and crime
Proponents of nature theory 
 
■
argue that intelligence is largely 
determined genetically, that 
ancestry determines IQ, and 
that low intelligence is linked to 
criminal behavior. Proponents 
of nurture theory argue that 
intelligence is not inherited 
and that low-IQ parents do not 
necessarily produce low-IQ 
children. The IQ–criminality 
debate is unlikely to be settled 
soon. Measurement is beset by 
many methodological problems.

 1. What should be done with the 
young children of violence-prone 
criminals if in fact research could 
show that the tendency to commit 
crime is inherited?
 2. After considering the existing re-
search on the subject, would you 
recommend that young children 
be forbidden from eating foods 
with a heavy sugar content?
 3. Knowing what you do about 
trends and patterns in crime, how 
would you counteract the asser-
tion that people who commit 
crime are physically or mentally 
abnormal? For example, how 
would you explain the fact that 
crime is more likely to occur in 
western and urban areas than in 
eastern or rural areas?
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
 4. Aside from becoming a criminal, 
what other career paths are open 
to psychopaths?
 5. Research shows that kids who 
watch a lot of TV in adolescence 
are more likely to behave aggres-
sively in adulthood. This has led 
some to conclude that TV watch-
ing is responsible for adult vio-
lence. Can this relationship be 
explained in another way?

The tiny country of El Salvador (population 7.2 million) is home to more than 40,000 gang members. Rather 
than being a homegrown phenomenon, gangs are actually a U.S. import. How did this happen? In the early 
1990s, hundreds of members of two of Los Angeles’s largest gangs, the 18th Street Gang and the MS-13 gang, 
who had illegally made their home in the United States, were deported back to El Salvador. The deportees 
brought L.A. gang culture with them to a country already swamped with weapons from an ongoing civil war. 
Now on their home turf, gang boys recruited thousands of local teenagers into their reconstituted gangs. 
Joining a gang gave these poor, urban teenagers a powerful sense of identity and belonging. They were also 
free now to show their courage and manhood by engaging in a never-ending turf war with one another.

shows the routine use of violence and the national scope of 
the problem.
This association between social conditions and crime is 
not lost on criminologists, many of whom conclude that crim-
inals are indigent and desperate people rather than abnormal, 
calculating, or evil. Raised in deteriorated parts of town, they 
lack the social support and economic resources available to 
more affl uent members of society. According to this view, it 
is social forces—and not individual traits—that cause crime. 
Social forces in disadvantaged areas may be so powerful that 
they overwhelm individual choice. In disadvantaged neigh-
borhoods, residents develop a feeling of fatalism and adopt a 
“nothing to lose” attitude. Regardless of personal traits or char-
acteristics, these factors force individuals to take advantage of 
criminal opportunities. While in a middle-class environment, 
people who maintain an antisocial or impulsive personality 
may fi nd the support they need to resist (or desist) the lure of 
antisocial activities; in the most disorganized inner-city areas 
of the city, everyone is susceptible to crime.5 According to this 
Both MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang are part of a signifi -
cant national gang population that has spread across the 
nation. Teen gangs have become an ever-present fi xture of 
the American urban experience. Gang members are heav-
ily armed, dangerous, and more violent than nonmembers. 
They are about 10 times more likely to carry handguns than 
nongang members, and gun-toting gang members commit 
about 10 times more violent crimes than nonmembers; gang 
homicides seem to be on an upswing. The most recent na-
tional survey fi nds that gangs exist in all levels of the social 
strata, from rural counties to metropolitan areas.3
To criminologists it comes as no surprise that gangs 
develop in poor, deteriorated urban neighborhoods. Many 
kids in these areas grow up hopeless and alienated, believ-
ing that they have little chance of being part of the Ameri-
can Dream.4 Joining a gang holds the promise of economic 
rewards and status enhancements, which the conventional 
world simply cannot provide. The Profiles in Crime fea-
ture discusses a recent case of gang activity in Virginia that 
Ironically, both gangs were started in Los Angeles by Salvadorans fl eeing a civil war. When they fi rst 
arrived in L.A. they were preyed upon by preexisting Mexican gangs. The MS-13 gang was formed as a means 
of self-protection. The gang’s name—Mara Salvatrucha—most likely comes from mara, slang for “army ant,” 
and salvatrucha, local slang for tough, streetwise Salvadorans; the “13” is a common L.A. gang reference. Over 
time, both gangs’ ranks grew and members entered a variety of rackets, from extortion to drug traffi cking. 
When law enforcement cracked down and deported members, the deportees quickly created outposts in El 
Salvador and throughout Central America. The Salvadoran government has responded by criminalizing gang 
membership and arresting thousands. But government efforts have not stemmed the tide of recruitment, and 
the gangs appear to be more popular than ever.1
MS-13 operates in at least 42 states and the District of Columbia and has about 6,000 to 10,000 members 
nationwide. Its members engage in a wide range of criminal activity, including drug distribution, murder, 
rape, prostitution, robbery, home invasions, immigration offenses, kidnapping, carjackings/auto thefts, 
and vandalism. MS-13 is expanding its membership through recruitment and migration. New members 
are recruited by experienced gang boys who glorify the gang lifestyle (often on the Internet, complete with 
pictures and videos) and by absorbing smaller gangs. MS-13 members supplement their illegal income by 
working for legitimate businesses (often by presenting false documentation). They primarily pick employers 
that don’t scrutinize employment documents, especially in the construction, restaurant, delivery service, and 
landscaping industries.
MS-13 originated in Los Angeles, but when members migrated eastward, they began forming cliques 
that for the most part operated independently. These cliques, though, often maintain regular contact with 
members in other regions to coordinate recruitment/criminal activities and to prevent confl icts.2
Some experts believe that the 10,000-member MS-13 is now the nation’s most dangerous gang, while the 
18th Street Gang, with over 20,000 members, is the largest.

numbers. Manchester, England, had 12,000 inhabitants 
in 1760 and 400,000 in 1850; during the same period, 
the population of Glasgow, Scotland, rose from 30,000 to 
300,000.
The development of machinery such as power looms 
had doomed cottage industries and given rise to a factory 
system in which large numbers of people toiled for ex-
tremely low wages. The spread of agricultural machines in-
creased the food supply while reducing the need for a large 
rural workforce; these excess laborers further swelled city 
populations. At the same time, political, religious, and so-
cial traditions continued to be challenged by the scientifi c 
method.
Quetelet and Durkheim
The application of sociological concepts to criminology can 
be traced to the works of pioneering sociologists L. A. J. 
(Adolphe) Quetelet (1796–1874) and (David) Émile Dur-
kheim (1858–1917). Quetelet instigated the use of data 
and statistics in performing criminological research. Dur-
kheim, considered one of the founders of sociology, defi ned 
crime as a normal and necessary social event.6 These two 
perspectives have been extremely influential on modern 
criminology.
view, rather than focusing on individual choice or traits to un-
derstand the root cause of criminal behavior, we must analyze 
the infl uence of these destructive social forces. In this chapter, 
we trace the origin of sociological criminology and then focus 
on how a person’s place in the social structure determines and 
shapes his or her behavior.
DEVELOPMENT 
OF SOCIOLOGICAL 
CRIMINOLOGY
At the same time that biological positivists were conduct-
ing their experiments, others were using social data to sci-
entifi cally study the major changes that were taking place in 
nineteenth-century society and in so doing helping to create 
the fi eld of sociology.
Sociology seemed an ideal perspective from which to 
study society. After thousands of years of stability, the world 
was undergoing a population explosion: the population 
estimated at 600 million in 1700 had risen to 900 million 
by 1800. People were fl ocking to cities in ever-increasing 
Road in Alexandria, Virginia. Once Luna 
and the prostitute arrived at Manor Road, 
they were quickly subdued by the heavily 
armed MS-13 members. When the gang 
bangers demanded extortion payments 
from Luna, he refused to a pay. A struggle 
ensued during which Luna attempted to 
grab Portillo’s handgun. The boys cut his 
throat and shot him three times but left the 
young woman unharmed. Portillo, Arguera, 
and Umaña fled after taking the money 
that Luna and the prostitute had earned 
that day. The young woman then flagged 
down a police car and called for help. An 
investigation was initiated by the local po-
lice departments, and federal agencies, 
including the FBI and the U.S. Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement office of 
investigations, leading to the arrest of the 
MS-13 in Action
MS-13 is considered one of the most fear-
some gangs in the United States, and the 
events of July 29, 2009, give clear sup-
port to this view. On that day, three MS-13 
members—Adolfo Amaya Portillo, Eris Ra-
mon Arguera, and Alcides Umaña—posed 
as potential customers to lure a pimp, Car-
los Luna, and one of his “girls” to Manor

someone’s life in what might be considered 
a minor dispute over money. It also shows 
the effects of gang migration: a gang formed 
in Los Angeles is now active in Virginia.

consequences of the shift from a small, rural society, which 
he labeled “mechanical,” to the more modern “organic” so-
ciety with a large urban population, division of labor, and 
personal isolation.10 From this shift fl owed anomie, or norm 
and role confusion, a powerful sociological concept that 
helps describe the chaos and disarray accompanying the 
loss of traditional values in modern society. Durkheim’s re-
search on suicide indicated that anomic societies maintain 
high suicide rates; by implication, anomie might cause other 
forms of deviance as well.
The Chicago School and Beyond
The primacy of sociological positivism as the intellectual 
basis of criminology was secured by research begun in the 
early twentieth century by Albion W. Small (1854–1926), 
who organized the famed sociology department at the Uni-
versity of Chicago. Referred to as the Chicago School, ur-
ban sociologists such as W. I. Thomas (1863–1947), Robert 
Ezra Park (1864–1944), Ernest W. Burgess (1886–1966), 
and Louis Wirth (1897–1952) pioneered research on the 
social ecology of the city. In 1915, Robert Ezra Park called 
for anthropological methods of description and observation 
to be applied to urban life.11 He was concerned with how 
neighborhood structure developed, how isolated pockets 
of poverty formed, and what social policies could be used 
to alleviate urban problems. In response, Chicago School 
sociologists carried out an ambitious program of research 
and scholarship on urban topics, including criminal be-
havior patterns. Harvey Zorbaugh’s The Gold Coast and the 
Slum, Frederick Thrasher’s The Gang, and Louis Wirth’s 
The Ghetto12 are classic examples of objective, highly de-
scriptive accounts of urban life. Park, with Ernest Burgess, 
studied the social ecology of the city and found that some 
neighborhoods form so-called natural areas of wealth and 
affl uence, while others suffered poverty and disintegration.13 
Regardless of their race, religion, or ethnicity, the everyday 
behavior of people living in these areas was controlled by 
the social and ecological climate.
This body of research inspired a generation of scholars 
to conclude that social forces operating in urban areas cre-
ate “natural areas” for crime.14 These urban neighborhoods 
maintain such a high level of poverty that critical institu-
tions of socialization and control, such as the school and the 
family, begin to break down. While normally these social in-
stitutions can apply the social control necessary to restrain 
the neighborhood youth, their weakness means that kids 
are now free to engage in exciting and enticing law-violat-
ing behaviors. As crime rates soar and residents are afraid 
to leave their homes at night, the neighborhood becomes 
socially disorganized—unable to apply social control on its 
residents. It can no longer muster the cohesion needed to 
protect its residents from crime, drug abuse, and violence. 
Criminal behavior is not then a function of personal traits 
or choice, but is linked to environmental conditions that 
Quetelet was a Belgian mathematician who began (along 
with a Frenchman, André-Michel Guerry) what is known 
as the cartographic school of criminology.7 This approach 
made use of social statistics that were being developed in 
Europe in the early nineteenth century. Statistical data pro-
vided important demographic information on the popula-
tion, including density, gender, religious affiliations, and 
wealth.
Quetelet studied data gathered in France (called the 
Comptes generaux de l’administration de la justice) to inves-
tigate the influence of social factors on the propensity to 
commit crime. In addition to fi nding a strong infl uence of 
age and sex on crime, Quetelet also uncovered evidence 
that season, climate, population composition, and poverty 
were related to criminality. More specifi cally, he found that 
crime rates were greatest in the summer, in southern areas, 
among heterogeneous populations, and among the poor and 
uneducated. He also found crime rates to be infl uenced by 
drinking habits.8 Quetelet identifi ed many of the relation-
ships between crime and social phenomena that still serve 
as a basis for criminology today. His fi ndings that crime had 
a social basis was a direct challenge to Lombrosian biologi-
cal determinism.
According to Émile Durkheim’s vision of social positiv-
ism, crime is part of human nature because it has existed 
during periods of both poverty and prosperity.9 Crime is 
normal because it is virtually impossible to imagine a society 
in which criminal behavior is totally absent. Such a soci-
ety would almost demand that all people be and act exactly 
alike. Durkheim believed that the inevitability of crime is 
linked to the differences (heterogeneity) within society. Since 
people are so different from one another and employ such 
a variety of methods and forms of behavior to meet their 
needs, it is not surprising that some will resort to criminal-
ity. Even if “real” crimes were eliminated, human weaknesses 
and petty vices would be elevated to the status of crimes. 
As long as human differences exist, then, crime is inevitable 
and one of the fundamental conditions of social life.
Durkheim argued that crime can even be useful and, on 
occasion, healthy for society. He held that the existence of 
crime paves the way for social change and indicates that the 
social structure is not rigid or infl exible. Put another way, 
if such differences did not exist, it would mean that every-
one behaved the same way and agreed on what is right and 
wrong. Such universal conformity would stifl e creativity and 
independent thinking. To illustrate this concept, Durkheim 
offered the example of the Greek philosopher Socrates, who 
was considered a criminal and put to death for corrupting 
the morals of youth simply because he expressed ideas that 
were different from what people believed at that time.
Durkheim reasoned that another benefit of crime is 
that it calls attention to social ills. A rising crime rate can 
signal the need for social change and promote a variety of 
programs designed to relieve the human suffering that may 
have caused crime in the fi rst place. In his infl uential book, 
The Division of Labor in Society, Durkheim described the

CHAPTER 6 | Social Structure Theories  189
Nor is the wealth concentration effect unique to the 
United States; it is a worldwide phenomenon. According to 
the most recent World Wealth Report, there are about 6 mil-
lion high net worth individuals in the world today (people 
with more than $1 million in assets excluding their primary 
residence); they have a collective net worth of more than 
$30.8 trillion, and their numbers are steadily growing.16
In contrast, the indigent have scant, if any, resources and 
suffer socially and economically as a result. And while the 
United States is the richest country in the world, the most 
recent federal data indicate that the number and rate of peo-
ple living in poverty has risen since 2000.17 (See Figure 6.1.) 
 Almost 40 million Americans now live in poverty.
Lower-class areas are scenes of inadequate housing and 
health care, disrupted family lives, underemployment, and 
despair. Members of the lower class also suffer in other 
ways. They are more prone to depression, less likely to have 
achievement motivation, and less likely to put off immediate 
gratifi cation for future gain. For example, they may be less 
willing to stay in school because the rewards for educational 
achievement are in the distant future.
The poor are constantly bombarded by the media with 
advertisements linking material possessions to self-worth, 
but they are often unable to attain desired goods and services 
through conventional means. Though they are members of a 
society that extols material success above any other, they are 
unable to satisfactorily compete for such success with mem-
bers of the upper classes. As a result, they may turn to illegal 
solutions to their economic plight: they may deal drugs for 
profi t, steal cars and sell them to “chop shops,” or commit 
armed robberies for desperately needed funds. They may be-
come so depressed that they take alcohol and drugs as a form 
of self-tranquilization, and because of their poverty, they may 
acquire the drugs and alcohol through illegal channels.
The Underclass
In 1966, sociologist Oscar Lewis argued that the crushing 
lifestyle of lower-class areas produces a culture of poverty, 
which is passed from one generation to the next.18 Apathy, 
cynicism, helplessness, and mistrust of social institutions 
such as schools, government agencies, and the police mark 
the culture of poverty. This mistrust prevents members of 
the lower class from taking advantage of the meager op-
portunities available to them. Lewis’s work was the fi rst of 
a group that described the plight of at-risk children and 
adults. In 1970, Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal de-
scribed a worldwide underclass that was cut off from soci-
ety, its members lacking the education and skills needed to 
be effectively in demand in modern society.19
Economic disparity will continually haunt members of 
the underclass and their children over the course of their 
life span. Even if they value education and other middle-
class norms, their desperate life circumstances (e.g., high 
unemployment and nontraditional family structures) may 
fail to provide residents with proper human relations and 
development.
The Chicago School sociologists initiated the view that 
crime and social ecological conditions were linked. Neigh-
borhood conditions, and not individual pathology, infl u-
ence and shape the direction of crime rates. Their writings 
became the core of sociological criminology, and the social 
environment and its influence on human behavior have 
remained the primary focus of criminology. Their author-
ity was such that most criminologists have been trained in 
sociology, and criminology courses are routinely taught in 
departments of sociology. What is their vision and how do 
they connect criminality with a person’s place in the social 
structure?
Concern about the ecological distribution of crime, 
the effect of social change, and the interactive nature 
of crime itself has made sociology the foundation of 
modern criminology. This chapter reviews sociological 
theories that emphasize the relationship between social 
status and criminal behavior. In Chapter 7, the focus 
shifts to sociological social psychology theories that 
emphasize socialization and its infl uence on crime and 
deviance; Chapter 8 covers theories based on the con-
cept of social confl ict.
CONNECTIONS
SOCIOECONOMIC 
STRUCTURE AND CRIME
People in the United States live in a stratifi ed society.  Social 
strata are created by the unequal distribution of wealth, 
power, and prestige. Social classes are segments of the pop-
ulation whose members have a relatively similar portion of 
desirable things and who share attitudes, values, norms, and 
an identifi able lifestyle. In U.S. society, it is common to iden-
tify people as upper-, middle-, and lower-class citizens, with 
a broad range of economic variations existing within each 
group. The upper-upper class is reserved for a small number 
of exceptionally well-to-do families who maintain enormous 
fi nancial and social resources. The top 20 percent of house-
holds earn more than $90,000 per year while the bottom 
20 percent averages about $19,000. The “super rich”—the 
top one-tenth of 1 percent (0.1 percent)— averages about 
$1.6 million in income each year.15 The very top, the 400 
highest-earning U.S. households, reported an average of 
$345 million in income in a single year (2007); the average 
income reported by the top 400 earners more than doubled 
from $131.1 million in 2001.

that impede their long-term development. Children who 
live in extreme poverty or who remain poor for multiple 
years appear to suffer the worst outcomes.
Besides their increased chance of physical illness, poor 
children are much more likely than wealthy children to suf-
fer various social and physical ills, ranging from low birth 
weight to a limited chance of earning a college degree. Many 
live in substandard housing—high-rise, multiple-family 
dwellings—which can have a negative influence on their 
long-term psychological health.26 Adolescents in the worst 
neighborhoods share the greatest risk of dropping out of 
school and becoming teenage parents.

Foundation, is a national and state-by-state effort

States. For more information, visit the Criminal Justice

Minority Group Poverty
The burdens of underclass life are often felt most acutely by mi-
nority group members. As Table 6.1 shows, there is real dispar-
ity in the annual income of Asian ($65,469), white ($54,461), 
Hispanic ($38,039), and black ($32,584) households.27
prevent them from developing the skills, habits, and life-
styles that lead fi rst to educational success and later to suc-
cess in the workplace.20 Their ability to maintain social ties 
in the neighborhood become weak and attenuated, further 
weakening a neighborhood’s cohesiveness and its ability to 
regulate the behavior of its citizens.21
Child Poverty
The timing of poverty also seems to be relevant. Findings 
suggest that poverty during early childhood may have a 
more severe impact on behavior than poverty during ado-
lescence and adulthood.22 This is particularly important to-
day because, as Figure 6.2 shows, children have a higher 
poverty rate, 19 percent, than any other age group.
Children are hit especially hard by poverty. Hundreds 
of studies have documented the association between fam-
ily poverty and children’s health, achievement, and behav-
ior impairments.23 Children who grow up in low-income 
homes are less likely to achieve in school and are less likely 
to complete their schooling than children with more affl u-
ent parents.24 Poor children are also more likely to suffer 
from health problems and to receive inadequate health care. 
The number of U.S. children covered by health insurance is 
declining and will continue to do so for the foreseeable fu-
ture.25 Without health benefi ts or the means to afford medi-
cal care, these children are likely to have health problems

in structured preschool settings. Clearly, minority children 
begin life with signifi cant social and educational defi cits.30
Race-based economic disparity can take a terrifi c toll. 
While whites use their economic, social, and political ad-
vantages to live in sheltered gated communities protected 
by security guards and police, minorities are denied similar 
protections and privileges.31 In contrast, a signifi cant pro-
portion of minority group members are relegated to living in 
inner-city areas, where they are hit hard by race-based dis-
parity such as income inequality and institutional racism.32
Black crime rates, more so than white, seem to be infl u-
enced by the shift of high-paid manufacturing jobs overseas 
and their replacement with lower-paid service sector jobs.33 In 
desperation, some turn to crime and drug dealing as a means 
of economic survival. More often than not, these desperate 
acts go awry, and the result is gunplay and death. And be-
cause victims may be white, there appears to be a racial moti-
vation. However, what appear to be racially motivated crimes 
may be more a function of economic factors (i.e., the shift of 
jobs overseas) rather than interracial hate or antagonism.34
Race, Income, and Crime Minority group problems are 
exacerbated by the lack of meaningful social effort to inte-
grate communities, resulting in neighborhoods that are all 
black, all white, all Hispanic, and so on. There is also the 
perception in the minority community that the police are 
overzealous in their duties, leading to feelings of injustice; in 
some neighborhoods a signifi cant portion—up to half—of

The share of young black men without jobs has climbed 
relentlessly, with only a slight pause during the economic 
peak of the late 1990s. Today, the African American unem-
ployment rate is signifi cantly higher than the white unem-
ployment rate.28 About 25 percent of African Americans and 
22 percent of Hispanics live in poverty as compared to 8 
percent of non-Hispanic whites and 11 percent of Asians.29 
These problems are not only experienced by adults: the rates 
of child poverty in the United States also vary signifi cantly 
by race and ethnicity. Latino and African American children 
are more than twice as likely to be poor as Asian and white 
children. Minority children are four times less likely to have 
health insurance as other kids. There are large ethnic dis-
parities in the amount of time preschool-age children spend

all minority males are under criminal justice system con-
trol.35 The costs of crime, such as paying for lawyers and 
court costs, perpetuate poverty by depriving families and 
children of this money.36 Among recent fi ndings about the 
plight suffered by young minority males are the following:
If they do commit crime, minority youth are more likely 
 
■
to be offi cially processed to the juvenile court than 
Caucasian youths, helping them develop an offi cial re-
cord at an early age, an outcome that may increase their 
chances of incarceration as adults.37
According to a recent report by the Pew Foundation, 
 
■
while 1 in 30 men between the ages of 20 and 34 is 
behind bars, for black males in that age group the fi gure 
is 1 in 9. One in 100 black women in their mid- to late-
30s are incarcerated compared to 1 in 355 European 
American women.38 One reason may be that the justice 
system routinely provides less favorable outcomes for 
minority youth, increasing the chances they will de-
velop an offi cial criminal record at an early age.
While dropout rates have declined, about 6 percent of 
 
■
white, 11 percent of black, and 22 percent of Hispanic 
students drop out of high school each year. In the in-
ner cities, more than half of all black men do not fi nish 
high school.39
These differentials are critical because interracial crime 
 
■
rate differentials may be explained by differences in 
standard of living: if interracial economic disparity 
would end, so too might differences in the crime rate.40
The issue of minority poverty is explored further in the

Just Race,” which discusses the works of William Julius  Wilson,

SOCIAL STRUCTURE 
THEORIES
The problems caused by poverty and income inequality are 
not lost on criminologists. They recognize that the various 
sources of crime data show that crime rates are highest in 
neighborhoods characterized by poverty and social disorder. 
Although members of the middle and upper classes some-
times engage in crime, these are generally nonviolent acts, 
such as embezzlement and fraud, which present little danger 
to the general public. In contrast, lower-class crime is often 
the violent, destructive product of youth gangs and marginally 
and underemployed young adults. The real crime problem is 
essentially a lower-class phenomenon, which breeds criminal 
behavior that begins in youth and continues into young adult-
hood. Kids growing up poor and living in households that 
lack economic resources are much more likely to get involved 
in serious crime than their wealthier peers.41 To explain this 
phenomenon, criminologists have formu-
lated social structure theories. As a group, 
they suggest that social and economic forces 
operating in deteriorated lower-class areas 
are the key determinant of criminal behavior 
patterns. Social forces begin to affect people 
while they are relatively young and continue 
to influence them throughout their lives. 
Though not all youthful offenders become 
adult criminals, those who are exposed to a 
continual stream of violence in deteriorated 
inner-city neighborhoods are the ones most 
likely to persist in their criminal careers.42
Social structure theorists challenge 
those who suggest that crime is an expres-
sion of some personal trait or individual 
choice. They argue that people living in 
equivalent social environments tend to be-
have in a similar, predictable fashion. If 
the environment did not infl uence human 
behavior, then crime rates would be dis-
tributed equally across the social structure, 
which they are not.43 Because crime rates 
are higher in lower-class urban centers than

About 25 percent of children in the United States live in poverty. These children are less 
likely to achieve in school or to complete their education. They are more likely to have 
health problems and to receive inadequate health care. Children living in poverty suffer a 
variety of social and physical ills, ranging from low birth weight to dropping out of school 
to becoming teenage parents.

either accept their condition and live out their days as 
socially responsible, if unrewarded, citizens, or they can 
choose an alternative means of achieving success, such 
as theft, violence, or drug traffi cking.
Cultural deviance theory
 
■
, the third variation of struc-
tural theory, combines elements of both strain and so-
cial disorganization. According to this view, because of 
strain and social isolation, a unique lower-class culture 
develops in disorganized neighborhoods. These inde-
pendent subcultures maintain a unique set of values 
and beliefs that are in confl ict with conventional social 
norms. Criminal behavior is an expression of confor-
mity to lower-class subcultural values and traditions 
and not a rebellion from conventional society. Subcul-
tural values are handed down from one generation to 
the next in a process called cultural transmission.
Although each of these theories is distinct in critical as-
pects, each approach has at its core the view that socially 
isolated people, living in disorganized neighborhoods, are 
the ones most likely to experience crime-producing social 
forces. Each branch of social structure theory will now be 
discussed in some detail.
Social Disorganization Theory
Social disorganization theory links crime rates to neighbor-
hood ecological characteristics. Communities where the 
fabric of social life has become frayed and torn are unable 
in middle-class suburbs, social forces must be operating in 
blighted urban areas that infl uence or control behavior.44
There are three independent yet overlapping branches 
within the social structure perspective—social disorganiza-
tion, strain theory, and cultural deviance theory (outlined in 
Figure 6.3):
Social disorganization theory 
 
■
focuses on the conditions 
within the urban environment that affect crime rates. A 
disorganized area is one in which institutions of social 
control—such as the family, commercial establishments, 
and schools—have broken down and can no longer carry 
out their expected or stated functions. Indicators of so-
cial disorganization include high unemployment, school 
dropout rates, deteriorated housing, low-income levels, 
and large numbers of single-parent households. Resi-
dents in these areas experience confl ict and despair, and, 
as a result, antisocial behavior fl ourishes.
Strain theory
 
■
 holds that crime is a function of the 
confl ict between the goals people have and the means 
they can use to obtain them legally. Most people in 
the United States desire wealth, material possessions, 
power, prestige, and other life comforts. And although 
these social and economic goals are common to people 
in all economic strata, strain theorists insist that the 
ability to obtain these goals is class dependent. Mem-
bers of the lower class are unable to achieve these 
symbols of success through conventional means. Con-
sequently, they feel anger, frustration, and resentment, 
which is referred to as strain. Lower-class citizens can 
Cultural deviance theory
combines the other two:
•  Development of subcultures
    as a result of disorganization
    and stress
•  Subcultural values in opposition
    to conventional values
Social disorganization theory focuses
on conditions in the environment:
•  Deteriorated neighborhoods
•  Inadequate social control
•  Law-violating gangs and groups
•  Conflicting social values
Strain theory focuses on conflict
between goals and means:
•  Unequal distribution of wealth and power
•  Frustration
•  Alternative methods of achievement

194  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
William Julius Wilson, one of the nation’s 
most prominent sociologists, has pro-
duced an impressive body of work that 
details racial problems and racial politics 
in American society. In 1987, he provided 
a description of the plight of the lowest 
levels of the underclass, which he labeled 
the truly disadvantaged. Wilson portrayed 
members of this group as socially isolated 
people who dwell in urban inner cities, oc-
cupy the bottom rung of the social ladder, 
and are the victims of discrimination. They 
live in areas in which the basic institutions 
of society––family, school, housing––have 
long since declined. Their decline triggers 
similar breakdowns in the strengths of in-
ner-city areas, including the loss of commu-
nity cohesion and the ability of people living 
in the area to control the flow of drugs and 
criminal activity. For example, in a more af-
fluent area, neighbors might complain to 
parents that their children were acting out. 
In distressed areas, this element of informal 
social control may be absent because par-
ents are under stress or all too often absent. 
These effects magnify the isolation of the 
underclass from mainstream society and 
promote a ghetto culture and behavior.
Because the truly disadvantaged rarely 
come into contact with the actual source 
of their oppression, they direct their anger 
and aggression at those with whom they 
are in close and intimate contact, such 
as neighbors, businesspeople, and land-
lords. Members of this group, plagued by 
under- or unemployment, begin to lose 
self-confidence, a feeling supported by the 
plight of kin and friendship groups who also 
experience extreme economic marginal-
ity. Self-doubt is a neighborhood norm, 
overwhelming those forced to live in areas 
of concentrated poverty.
In his important book, When Work Dis-
appears, Wilson assesses the effect of 
joblessness and underemployment on resi-
dents in poor neighborhoods on Chicago’s 
south side. He argues that for the first time 
since the nineteenth century, most adults 
in inner-city ghetto neighborhoods are not 
working during a typical week. He finds that 
inner-city life is only marginally affected by 
changes in the nation’s economy and unaf-
fected by technological development. Pov-
erty in these inner-city areas is eternal and 
unchanging and, if anything, worsening as 
residents are further shut out of the eco-
nomic mainstream.
Wilson focuses on the plight of the Af-
rican American community, which had en-
joyed periods of relative prosperity in the 
1950s and 1960s. He suggests that as dif-
ficult as life was in the 1940s and 1950s for 
African Americans, they at least had a rea-
sonable hope of steady work. Now, because 
of the globalization of the economy, those 
opportunities have evaporated. Though in 
the past racial segregation had limited op-
portunity, growth in the manufacturing sec-
tor fueled upward mobility and provided 
the foundation of today’s African American 
middle class. Those opportunities no longer 
exist as manufacturing plants have moved 
to inaccessible rural and overseas locations 
where the cost of doing business is lower. 
With manufacturing opportunities all but 
obsolete in the United States, service and 
retail establishments, which depended on 
blue-collar spending, have similarly disap-
peared, leaving behind an economy based 
on welfare and government supports. In 
less than 20 years, formerly active Afri-
can American communities have become 
crime-infested inner-city neighborhoods.
The hardships faced by residents in 
Chicago’s south side are not unique to that 
community. Beyond sustaining inner-city 
poverty, the absence of employment op-
portunities has torn at the social fabric of 
the nation’s inner-city neighborhoods. Work 
helps socialize young people into the wider 
society, instilling in them such desirable 
values as hard work, caring, and respect for 
others. When work becomes scarce, how-
ever, the discipline and structure it provides 
are absent. Community-wide underemploy-
ment destroys social cohesion, increasing 
the presence of neighborhood social prob-
lems ranging from drug use to educational 
failure. Schools in these areas are unable 
to teach basic skills and because desirable 
employment is lacking, there are few adults 
to serve as role models. In contrast to more 
affluent suburban households where daily 
life is organized around job and career 
demands, children in inner-city areas are 
not socialized in the workings of the main-
stream economy.
In The Bridge over the Racial Divide: 
Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics, Wil-
son expands on his views of race in con-
temporary society. He argues that there is a 
growing inequality in American society, and 
ordinary families, of all races and ethnic ori-
gins, are suffering. Whites, Latinos, African 
Americans, Asians, and Native Americans 
must therefore begin to put aside their dif-
ferences and concentrate more on what 
they have in common—their aspirations, 
problems, and hopes. There needs to be 
mutual cooperation across racial lines.

to provide essential services to their residents, such as 
education, health care, and proper housing. Residents in 
these crime-ridden neighborhoods want to fl ee the area at 
the earliest opportunity. Because they want out, they be-
come uninterested in community matters. As a result, these 
neighborhoods are destabilized. There is constant popula-
tion turnover; people are not interested in investing in these 
communities. Soon streets are littered and untidy, housing 
becomes deteriorated, and the neighborhood is rezoned for 
mixed-use (i.e., residential and commercial property exist 
side by side).
Because the area is undergoing stress, the normal sources 
of social control common to most neighborhoods—the family, 
school, neighbors, business owners, the church, law enforce-
ment, and social service agencies—become ineffective, weak, 
and disorganized. Personal relationships are strained because

CHAPTER 6 | Social Structure Theories  195
One reason for this set of mutual prob-
lems is that the government tends to ag-
gravate rather than ease the financial stress 
being placed on ordinary families. Monetary 
policy, trade policy, and tax policy are harm-
ful to working-class families. A multiracial 
citizens’ coalition could pressure national 
public officials to focus on the interests of 
ordinary people. As long as middle- and 
working-class groups are fragmented along 
racial lines, such pressure is impossible.
Wilson finds that racism is becoming 
more subtle and harder to detect. Whites 
believe that blacks are responsible for their 
inferior economic status because of their 
cultural traits. Because even affluent whites 
fear corporate downsizing, they are unwill-
ing to vote for governmental assistance to 
the poor because it means more taxes and 
lower corporate profits, a condition that 
threatens their jobs. Whites are continuing 
to be suburban dwellers, further isolating 
poor minorities in central cities and making 
their problems distant and unimportant. Wil-
son continues to believe that the changing 
marketplace, with its reliance on sophisti-
cated computer technologies, is continually 
decreasing demand for low-skilled workers, 
which impacts African Americans more 
negatively than other better educated and 
affluent groups.
Wilson argues for a cross-race, class-
based alliance of working- and middle-
class Americans to pursue policies that will 
benefit them rather than the affluent. These 
include full employment, programs to help 
families and workers in their private lives, 
and a reconstructed “affirmative opportu-
nity” program that benefits African Ameri-
cans without antagonizing whites.
In There Goes the Neighborhood, Wil-
son, along with Richard Taub, assesses 
racial relations in four Chicago neighbor-
hoods. The picture he paints is quite bleak. 
He finds that racism is still an active part of 
people’s lives though its motif is changing. 
People are unusually hostile when outsid-
ers move into their enclave. If they have a 
choice, they move; if not, they are angry 
and sullen. In a white middle-class neigh-
borhood, people are angry when black and 
Latino newcomers arrive, believing they 
threaten property values and neighbor-
hood stability. Whites and Latinos are able 
to reach common ground on only one social 
issue: preventing kids from being bused to a 
black school district. People seem unfazed 
about using offensive racist language to ex-
press their feelings and feel superior to other 
groups and races. Racism seems to cloak 
social anxiety: people worried about jobs 
and health care take their frustrations out 
on others. Wilson as always comes up with a 
prescription for positive change: strengthen 
neighborhood social organizations and peo-
ple will be less likely to flee. Race relations 
can be improved if people from diverse 
backgrounds can come together to reach 
common goals such as school improve-
ment. Society as a whole must be willing to 
help out and repair inner-city ghetto areas. 
Without such help, racial and class tensions 
spread throughout the city.
In his most recent work, More than Just 
Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner 
City, Wilson tries to explain the persistence 
of poverty in black neighborhoods: is it cul-
tural (family, personal values) or structural 
(segregation, racism)? He finds that both 
factors play a role. For example, a law-
and-order political philosophy and fear of 
racial conflict have led to high incarcera-
tion rates among African American males. 
While black women can get jobs in service 
industries, employers are less likely to hire 
black men, especially those with a criminal 
record. As a result, there has been a de-
cline in the ability of black men to be pro-
viders and further stress on the stability of 
the African American family. Here we can 
see how structure and culture intertwine 
to produce stress in the African American 
community. In an era of 10 percent unem-
ployment, the picture Wilson paints is not 
encouraging.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Is it unrealistic to assume that a govern-
ment-sponsored public works program 
can provide needed jobs in this era of 
budget cutbacks?
 2. What are some of the hidden costs of 
unemployment in a community setting?
 3. How would a biocriminologist explain 
Wilson’s findings?

neighbors are constantly relocating to better areas. Resident 
turnover further weakens communication and blocks the 
establishment of common goals. The result: any attempt at 
community-level problem solving ends in frustration.45
The problems encountered in this type of disorganized 
area take the form of a contagious disease, destroying the 
inner workings that enable neighborhoods to survive; the 
community becomes “hollowed out.”46 Crime and violence 
take the form of a “slow epidemic,” spreading to surround-
ing areas and infecting them with inner-city problems.47
Gang Formation Because social institutions are frayed or 
absent, law-violating youth groups and gangs form and are 
free to recruit neighborhood youth. Both boys and girls who 
feel detached and alienated from their social world are at 
risk to become gang members.48

196  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Foundations of Social Disorganization Theory Social 
disorganization theory was fi rst popularized by the work 
of two Chicago sociologists, Clifford R. Shaw and Henry D. 
McKay, who linked life in disorganized, transitional urban 
areas to neighborhood crime rates. Shaw and McKay began 
their pioneering work on crime in Chicago during the early 
1920s while working as researchers for a state-supported 
social service agency.51 They were heavily influenced by 
Chicago School sociologists Ernest Burgess and Robert Park, 
who had pioneered the ecological analysis of urban life.
Shaw and McKay began their analysis during a period in 
the city’s history that was fairly typical of the transition that 
was taking place in many other urban areas. Chicago had 
experienced a mid-nineteenth-century population expan-
sion, fueled by a dramatic infl ux of foreign-born immigrants 
and, later, migrating southern families. Congregating in the 
central city, the newcomers occupied the oldest housing ar-
eas and therefore faced numerous health and environmental 
hazards.
Sections of the city started to physically deteriorate. This 
condition prompted the city’s wealthy, established citizens 
to become concerned about the moral fabric of Chicago 
society. The belief was widespread that immigrants from 
Europe and the rural South were crime prone and morally 
dissolute. In fact, local groups were created with the very 
purpose of “saving” the children of poor families from moral 
decadence.52 It was popular to view crime as the property of 
inferior racial and ethnic groups.
Transitional Neighborhoods Shaw and McKay explained 
crime and delinquency within the context of the changing 
urban environment and ecological development of the city. 
They saw that Chicago had developed into distinct neighbor-
hoods (natural areas), some affl uent and others wracked by 
extreme poverty. These poverty-ridden, transitional neigh-
borhoods suffered high rates of population turnover and 
were incapable of inducing residents to remain and defend 
the neighborhoods against criminal groups.
Low rents in these areas attracted groups with different 
racial and ethnic backgrounds. Newly arrived immigrants 
from Europe and the South congregated in these transitional 
neighborhoods. Their children were torn between assimilat-
ing into a new culture and abiding by the traditional val-
ues of their parents. They soon found that informal social 
control mechanisms that had restrained behavior in the 
“old country” or rural areas were disrupted. These urban 
areas were believed to be the spawning grounds of young 
criminals.
In transitional areas, successive changes in the popu-
lation composition, disintegration of traditional cultures, 
diffusion of divergent cultural standards, and gradual indus-
trialization of the area result in dissolution of neighborhood 
culture and organization. The continuity of conventional 
neighborhood traditions and institutions is broken, leaving 
children feeling displaced and without a strong or defi nitive 
set of values.
Not surprisingly, then, there are now more than 27,000 
gangs such as MS-13 in the United States, containing about 
800,000 members.49 Nor is ganging unique to the United 
States. In his recent book, A World of Gangs (2008), John 
Hagedorn, a leading authority on the topic, shows there are 
now more than a billion people who live in urban slums 
around the world. Gangs are a common feature in these 
disorganized areas. They engage in a variety of activities, 
including drug dealing and crime and in some areas are 
involved in political violence. While gangs may be orga-
nized by race, their true purpose is to provide a platform 
for members to confront poverty, racism, and confl ict. They 
have their own culture language (i.e., gangsta rap), and 
members espouse a philosophy of survival by any means 
necessary. Gangs will fl ourish and expand if globalization 
continues to produce masses of the very poor and a few 
super-rich.50
The elements of social disorganization theory are shown 
in Figure 6.4.

CHAPTER 6 | Social Structure Theories  197
McKay’s time, the most important elements of their fi ndings 
still hold up:55
Crime rates are sensitive to the destructive social forces 
 
■
operating in lower-class urban neighborhoods.
Environmental factors, rather than individual differ-
 
■
ences, are the root cause of crime. Personal abnormality 
or inferiority has little to do with crime rates.
Crime is a constant fi xture in poverty areas regardless of 
 
■
racial or ethnic makeup.
Neighborhood disintegration and the corresponding 
 
■
erosion of social control are the primary causes of crim-
inal behavior; community values, norms, and cohesive-
ness affect individual behavior choices.
Despite these noteworthy achievements, the validity of 
some of Shaw and McKay’s positions have been challenged. 
Some critics have faulted their assumption that neighbor-
hoods are essentially stable, suggesting that there is a great 
deal more fl uidity and transition than assumed by Shaw and 
McKay.56 There is also concern about their reliance on po-
lice records to calculate neighborhood crime rates. Relying 
on offi cial data means that fi ndings may be more sensitive 
to the validity of police-generated data than they are true in-
terzone crime rate differences. Numerous studies indicate 
that police use extensive discretion when arresting people 
and that social status is one factor that infl uences their de-
cisions.57 It is possible that people in middle-class neigh-
borhoods commit many criminal acts that never show up 
in official statistics, whereas people in lower-class areas 
face a far greater chance of arrest and court adjudication.58 
Concentric Zones Shaw and McKay 
identifi ed the areas in Chicago that had 
excessive crime rates. Using a model of 
analysis pioneered by Ernest Burgess, 
they noted that distinct ecological areas 
had developed in the city, comprising a 
series of fi ve concentric circles, or zones, 
and that there were stable and signifi-
cant differences in interzone crime rates 
(Figure 6.5). The areas of heaviest con-
centration of crime appeared to be the 
transitional inner-city zones, where large 
numbers of foreign-born citizens had re-
cently settled.53 The zones furthest from 
the city’s center had correspondingly 
lower crime rates.
Analysis of these data indicated a 
surprisingly stable pattern of criminal 
activity in the various ecological zones 
over a 65-year period. Shaw and  McKay 
concluded that, in the transitional 
neighborhoods, multiple cultures and 
diverse values, both conventional and 
deviant, coexist. Children growing up in 
the street culture often fi nd that adults 
who have adopted a deviant lifestyle are the most fi nan-
cially successful people in the neighborhood: for example, 
the gambler, the pimp, or the drug dealer. Required to 
choose between conventional and deviant lifestyles, many 
inner-city kids saw the value in opting for the latter. They 
join with other like-minded youths and form law-violating 
gangs and cliques. The development of teenage law-violat-
ing groups is an essential element of youthful misbehavior 
in lower-class areas. The values that inner-city youths adopt 
are often in conflict with existing middle-class norms, 
which demand strict obedience to the legal code. Conse-
quently, a value conflict occurs that sets the delinquent 
youth and his or her peer group even further apart from 
conventional society. The result is a more solid embrace of 
deviant goals and behavior. To justify their choice of goals, 
these youths seek support by recruiting new members and 
passing on the delinquent tradition.
Shaw and McKay’s statistical analysis confirmed their 
theoretical suspicions. Even though crime rates changed, 
they found that the highest rates were always in Zones I and 
II (central city and a transitional area). The areas with the 
highest crime rates retained high rates even when their eth-
nic composition changed (in the areas Shaw and McKay ex-
amined, from German and Irish to Italian and Polish).54
The Legacy of Shaw and McKay Social disorganization 
concepts articulated by Shaw and McKay have remained a 
prominent fi xture of criminological scholarship and think-
ing for more than 75 years. While cultural and social con-
ditions have changed and American society today is much 
more heterogeneous and mobile than during Shaw and

sources of social control common to most neighborhoods—the family, school, personal ties, 
interest of the business community, law enforcement, and social service agencies—become 
weak and disorganized. When social control can be maintained, the likelihood of crime and 
violence decreases.

structural theory that emphasizes the association of commu-
nity deterioration and economic decline to criminality, but 
places less emphasis on the value and norm confl ict that lay 
at the core of Shaw and McKay’s vision. According to this 
more contemporary view, living in deteriorated, crime-rid-
den neighborhoods exerts a powerful infl uence over behav-
ior that is strong enough to neutralize the positive effects of a 
supportive family and close social ties. If individual or family 
status infl uences criminality and violence, it is because of the 
nature of the communities in which disadvantaged persons 
and families reside and not the strength of family relation-
ships themselves.60 In the following sections, some of the 
more recent social ecological research is discussed in detail.
Community Deterioration Social ecologists have focused 
their attention on the association between crime rates and 
community deterioration: disorder, poverty, alienation, 
disassociation, and fear of crime.61 They find that neigh-
borhoods with a high percentage of deserted houses and 
apartments experience high crime rates; abandoned build-
ings serve as a “magnet for crime.”62 Areas in which houses 
are in poor repair, boarded up, and burned out, and whose 
owners are best described as “slumlords,” are also the lo-
cation of the highest violence rates and gun crime.63 These 
are neighborhoods in which retail establishments often go 
bankrupt, are abandoned, and deteriorate physically.64
Poverty Concentration William Julius Wilson describes 
how working- and middle-class families fl ee inner-city pov-
erty areas, resulting in a poverty concentration effect in 
which the most disadvantaged population is consolidated 
in the most disorganized urban neighborhoods. Poverty 
concentration has been associated with income and wealth 
disparities, nonexistent employment opportunities, inferior 
housing patterns, and unequal access to health care.65 Ur-
ban areas marked by concentrated poverty become isolated 
and insulated from the social mainstream and more prone 
to criminal activity, violence, and homicide.66
How does neighborhood poverty concentration produce 
high crime rates? White families are more likely to leave 
an area when they perceive that the surrounding neigh-
borhoods have become predominantly minority.67 As the 
working and middle classes move out to the suburbs, they 
take with them their fi nancial and institutional resources 
and support, undermining the community’s level of infor-
mal social control.68 People left behind are socially isolated 
and have even a tougher time managing urban decay and 
confl ict and/or controlling youth gangs and groups; after all, 
the most successful people in the community have left for 
“greener pastures.”69 Businesses are disinclined to locate in 
poverty areas; banks become reluctant to lend money for 
new housing or businesses.70
In sum, inner-city crime motivates middle-class fl ight to 
the suburbs, isolating the poor in central-city ghettos and 
barrios, concentrating poverty and creating an environment 
within which criminal behavior becomes normative, and 
The relationship between ecology and crime rates, therefore, 
may refl ect police behavior more than criminal behavior.
These criticisms aside, the concept of social disorgani-
zation provides a valuable contribution to our understand-
ing of the causes of criminal behavior. By introducing a new 
variable—the ecology of the city—to the study of crime, 
Shaw and McKay paved the way for a whole generation of 
criminologists to focus on the social infl uences of criminal 
and delinquent behavior.

CHAPTER 6 | Social Structure Theories  199
they are approached by someone in the neighborhood sell-
ing drugs. They become afraid when they see neighborhood 
kids hanging out in community parks and playgrounds or 
when gangs proliferate in the neighborhood.82 They may fear 
that their children will also be approached and seduced into 
the drug life.83 The presence of such incivilities, especially 
when accompanied by relatively high crime rates, convinces 
residents that their neighborhood is dangerous; becoming 
a crime victim seems inevitable.84 Eventually they become 
emotionally numb, and as their exposure to crime increases, 
they experience indifference to the suffering of others.85
Fear can become contagious. People tell others when 
they have been victimized, spreading the word that the 
neighborhood is getting dangerous and that the chances 
of future victimization are high.86 They dread leaving their 
homes at night and withdraw from community life.
Fear of repeat victimization may be both instinctual and 
accurate. Remember that in Chapter 3 we discussed the 
fact that some people may be “victim prone” and fated 
to suffer repeated victimization over the life course.
CONNECTIONS
When people live in areas where the death rates are high 
and life expectancies are short, they may alter their behavior 
out of fear. They may feel, “Why plan for the future when 
there is a signifi cant likelihood that I may never see it?” In 
such areas, young boys and girls may psychologically as-
similate by taking risks and discounting the future. Teenage 
birthrates soar and so do violence rates.87 For these chil-
dren, the inevitability of death skews their perspective of 
how they live their lives.
When fear grips a neighborhood, business conditions 
begin to deteriorate, population mobility increases, and 
a “criminal element” begins to drift into the area.88 In es-
sence, the existence of fear incites more crime, increasing 
the chances of victimization, producing even more fear, in 
a never-ending loop.89 Fear is often associated with other 
community-level factors:
 1. Race and fear. Fear of crime is also bound up in anxiety 
over racial and ethnic confl icts. Fear becomes most pro-
nounced in areas undergoing rapid and unexpected ra-
cial and age-composition changes, especially when they 
are out of proportion to the rest of the city.90 Whites be-
come particularly fearful when they sense that they are 
becoming a racial minority in their neighborhood.91
The fear experienced by whites may be based on ra-
cial stereotypes, but it may also be caused by the premo-
nition that they will become less well protected because 
police do not provide adequate services in predomi-
nantly African American neighborhoods.92
Whites are not the only group to experience race-
based fear. Minority group members may experience 
greater levels of fear than whites, perhaps because they 
leading impressionable youth to adopt criminal lifestyles. 
The resulting deterioration in social capital in high-poverty 
areas reduces community social control, opening the door 
forever to expanding community crime rates.71
Chronic Unemployment The association between unem-
ployment and crime is still unsettled: aggregate crime rates 
and aggregate unemployment rates seem weakly related. In 
other words, crime rates sometimes rise during periods of 
economic prosperity and fall during periods of economic 
decline.72 Yet, as Shaw and McKay claimed, neighborhoods 
that experience chronic unemployment also encounter so-
cial disorganization and crime.73 How can these divergent 
trends be explained?
One possibility is that even though short-term national 
economic trends may have little effect on crime, long-term 
local unemployment rates may have a more signifi cant impact 
on conditions at the community or neighborhood level.74
How does job loss lead to crime? Unemployment destabi-
lizes households, and unstable families are the ones most 
likely to produce children who put a premium on violence 
and aggression as a means of dealing with limited oppor-
tunity. This lack of opportunity perpetuates higher crime 
rates, especially when large groups or cohorts of people of 
the same age compete for relatively scant resources.75
Limited employment opportunities also reduce the sta-
bilizing influence of parents and other adults, who may 
have once been able to counteract the allure of youth gangs. 
Sociologist Elijah Anderson’s analysis of Philadelphia neigh-
borhood life found that “old heads” (i.e., respected neigh-
borhood residents) who at one time played an important 
role in socializing youth have been displaced by younger 
street hustlers and drug dealers. While the old heads com-
plain that these newcomers may not have earned or worked 
for their fortune in the “old-fashioned way,” the old heads 
also admire and envy these kids whose gold chains and 
luxury cars advertise their wealth amid poverty.76 The old 
heads may admire the fruits of crime, but they disdain the 
violent manner in which they were acquired.
Community Fear In neighborhoods where people help 
one another, residents are less likely to fear crime and be 
afraid of becoming a crime victim.77 When people feel dis-
tant from one another, disconnected from others in the com-
munity, they are more likely to view their environment as a 
dangerous place.78
People feel safe in neighborhoods that are orderly and in 
repair.79 In contrast, those living in neighborhoods that suffer 
social and physical incivilities—rowdy youth, trash and litter, 
graffi ti, abandoned storefronts, burned-out buildings, littered 
lots, strangers, drunks, vagabonds, loiterers, prostitutes, noise, 
congestion, angry words, dirt, and stench—are much more 
likely to be fearful. Put another way, disorder breeds fear.80
Fear is based on experience. Residents who have already 
been victimized are more fearful of the future than those 
who have escaped crime.81 People become afraid when

unexpected results. This is the topic of the accompany-
ing Thinking Like a Criminologist feature.
Community Change In our postmodern society, the ur-
ban areas undergoing rapid structural changes in racial and 
economic composition also seem to experience the greatest 
change in crime rates. In contrast, stable neighborhoods, 
even those with a high rate of poverty, experience relatively 
low crime rates and have the strength to restrict substance 
abuse and criminal activity.100
Recent studies recognize that change, not stability, is the 
hallmark of inner-city areas. A neighborhood’s residents, 
wealth, density, and purpose are constantly evolving. Even 
disorganized neighborhoods acquire new identifying fea-
tures. Some may become multiracial, while others become 
racially homogeneous. Some areas become stable and fam-
ily oriented, while in others, mobile, never-married people 
predominate.101
As areas decline, some residents fl ee to safer, more stable 
localities. Those who cannot leave because they cannot afford 
to live in more affl uent communities face an increased risk of 
victimization. Those who can move to more affl uent neigh-
borhoods fi nd that their lifestyles and life chances improve 
immediately and continue to do so over their life span.102 
Take for instance the Gautreaux Program, a major initiative 
ordered by the courts in 1976 to provide a metropolitan-wide 
remedy for racial discrimination in Chicago’s public housing 
program. The program helped inner-city families relocate to 
more affl uent white suburbs. Research on the effects of the 
Gautreaux program shows that most families who moved to 
Chicago’s suburbs were still living in those suburbs 10 and 
even 20 years later. Despite some race-based problems, chil-
dren’s attitudes toward school improved and their grades did 
not drop. Moreover, as children in these Gautreaux families 
grew up and left home, they moved to neighborhoods that 
were far safer and more affl uent than the inner-city neighbor-
hoods their families had left behind.103
High population turnover can have a devastating effect 
on community culture because it thwarts communication 
and information fl ow.104 In response to this turnover, a cul-
ture may develop that dictates standards of dress, language, 
and behavior to neighborhood youth that are in opposition 
to those of conventional society. All these factors are likely 
to produce increased crime rates.
The Cycles of Community Change During periods of 
population turnover, communities may undergo changes 
that undermine their infrastructure. Urban areas seem to 
have life cycles, which begin with building residential dwell-
ings and are followed by a period of decline, with marked 
decreases in socioeconomic status and increases in popula-
tion density.105 Later stages in this life cycle include changing 
racial or ethnic makeup, population thinning, and fi nally, 
a renewal stage in which obsolete housing is replaced and 
upgraded (gentrifi cation). Areas undergoing such change 
seem to experience an increase in their crime rates.106
may have fewer resources to address ongoing social 
problems.93 Fear can be found among other racial and 
ethnic groups, especially when they believe they are in 
the minority and vulnerable to attack. In their study of 
race relations in Florida, Ted Chiricos and his associates 
found that whites feel threatened by Latinos and blacks 
but only in South Florida where whites are outnumbered 
by those two groups; in contrast, Latinos are threatened 
by blacks but only outside of South Florida where Lati-
nos are the minority.94
 2. Gangs and fear. Gangs fl ourish in deteriorated neighbor-
hoods with high levels of poverty, lack of investment, high 
unemployment rates, and population turnover.95 Unlike 
any other crime, however, gang activity is frequently un-
dertaken out in the open, on the public ways, and in full 
view of the rest of the community.96 Brazen criminal ac-
tivity undermines community solidarity because it signals 
that the police must be either corrupt or inept. The fact 
that gangs are willing to openly engage in drug sales and 
other types of criminal activity shows their confi dence 
that they have silenced or intimidated law-abiding people 
in their midst. The police and the community alike be-
come hopeless about their ability to restore community 
stability, producing greater levels of community fear.
 3. Mistrust and fear. People who report living in neighbor-
hoods with high levels of crime and civil disorder be-
come suspicious and mistrusting.97 They develop a 
sense of powerlessness, which amplifies the effect of 
neighborhood disorder and increases levels of mistrust. 
Some residents become so suspicious of authority that 
they develop a siege mentality in which the outside 
world is considered the enemy out to destroy the neigh-
borhood. Elijah Anderson found that residents in the 
African American neighborhoods he studied believed in 
the existence of a secret plan to eradicate the population 
by such strategies as permanent unemployment, police 
brutality, imprisonment, drug distribution, and AIDS.98 
White officials and political leaders were believed to 
have hatched this conspiracy, and it was demonstrated 
by the lax law enforcement efforts in poor areas. Resi-
dents felt that police cared little about black-on-black 
crime because it helped reduce the population. Rumors 
abounded that federal government agencies, such as the 
CIA, controlled the drug trade and used profi ts to fund 
illegal overseas operations.
This siege mentality results in mistrust of critical 
social institutions, including business, government, 
and schools. Government officials seem arrogant and 
haughty. Residents become self-conscious, worried 
about garnering any respect, and are particularly at-
tuned to anyone who disrespects them. Considering this 
feeling of mistrust, when police ignore crime in poor ar-
eas or, conversely, when they are violent and corrupt, 
anger fl ares, and people take to the streets and react in 
violent ways.99 When people are fearful, they may de-
mand more aggressive police protection, with sometimes

that justify violence as a means of protecting their property 
and way of life by violently resisting newcomers.111 They 
may also demand more money be spent on police and other 
justice agencies. As racial prejudice increases, the call for 
law and order aimed at controlling the minority population 
grows louder.112
Collective Efficacy
Cohesive communities, whether urban or rural, with high 
levels of social control and social integration, where people 
know one another and develop interpersonal ties, may also 
develop collective effi cacy: mutual trust, a willingness to 
intervene in the supervision of children, and the mainte-
nance of public order.113 It is the cohesion among neigh-
borhood residents combined with shared expectations for 
informal social control of public space that promotes col-
lective effi cacy.114 Residents in these areas are able to enjoy 
a better life because the fruits of cohesiveness can be better 
education, health care, and housing opportunities.115
In contrast, residents of socially disorganized neighbor-
hoods fi nd that efforts at social control are weak and attenu-
ated. People living in economically disadvantaged areas are 
As communities go through cycles, neighborhood 
deterioration precedes increasing rates of crime and de-
linquency.107 Neighborhoods most at risk for crime rate in-
creases contain large numbers of single-parent families and 
unrelated people living together, have gone from having 
owner-occupied to renter-occupied units, and have an eco-
nomic base that has lost semiskilled and unskilled jobs (in-
dicating a growing residue of discouraged workers who are 
no longer seeking employment).108 These ecological disrup-
tions strain existing social control mechanisms and inhibit 
their ability to control crime and delinquency.
Racial Threat Community change may also have racial 
overtones. Because of racial differences in economic well-be-
ing, those “left behind” are all too often minority citizens.109
Those who cannot move fi nd themselves surrounded by a 
constant infl ux of new residents. Whites may feel threatened 
as the number of minorities in the population increases and 
competes with them for jobs and political power.110 Accord-
ing to the racial threat hypothesis, as the percentage of mi-
nority group members in the population increases, so too 
does the crime rate. Why does this phenomenon occur? In 
changing neighborhoods, adults may actually encourage the 
law-violating behavior of youths. They may express attitudes 
A number of citizen complaints have been filed 
against Northtown police officers Donald Libby 
and Karen O’Brien, each of whom have more 
than 15 years on the force. The problems began 
soon after Chief Wayne Goldner, under pressure 
from the media to “do something” about the 
gang problem in the central city area, initiated 
Operation Hammerhead. Designed to bring 
about immediate change in the area, Hammer-
head created an independent gang control unit 
made up of 12 officers who were to act independently 
under supervision of a lieutenant. The Hammerhead squad created 
files on known gang members and gang locales, and ran a group of 
informers to generate intelligence on gang activity. The squad was to 
respond quickly to emergencies and calls for assistance pertaining to 
gang activity. One of their assignments was to displace gang mem-
bers who hung out on corners, harassed passersby, exhorted money 
from merchants, and actively sold drugs.
After a few months on the job, two members of the team, Libby 
and O’Brien, were the target of numerous complaints, which cen-
tered on their treatment of neighborhood youth. They were charged 
with roughing up neighborhood kids, slapping some of them around, 
and being disrespectful. In the most serious incident, they used 
a nightstick on the head of a 15-year-old they suspected of being 
a member of the local 13th Street gang and who was seen selling 
drugs openly on the street. The youth suffered a 
broken arm and concussion and required hos-
pitalization. When interviewed by the Internal 
Affairs Bureau, the officers claimed they were 
“only doing their job” and that the boy had been 
aggressive and disrespectful when apprehended. 
Besides, they argued, Hammerhead’s command-
ing officer knew they were using aggressive tac-
tics, community leaders had demanded results, 
and—most importantly—gang activity had de-
clined 22 percent in the area since Hammerhead 
was instituted. So while the two readily admit to all the allegations 
lodged against them, they contend that they were justified under the 
circumstances. The boy and his parents have also filed suit, claim-
ing that the amount of force used was unnecessary and violated his 
civil rights.

as schools and afternoon programs, is often attenuated or 
blocked.126 Children are at risk for recruitment into gangs 
and law-violating groups when there is a lack of effective 
public services. Gangs become an attractive alternative when 
adolescents have little to do after school and must rely on 
out-of-home care rather than more structured school-based 
programs.127 As a result, crime may fl ourish and neighbor-
hood fear increases, conditions that decrease a community’s 
cohesion and thwart the ability of its institutions to exert 
social control over its residents.128
To combat these infl uences, communities that have col-
lective effi cacy attempt to utilize their local institutions to 
control crime. Sources of institutional social control include 
businesses, stores, schools, churches, and social service and 
volunteer organizations.129 When these institutions are effec-
tive, crime rates decline.130 Some institutions, such as recre-
ation centers for teens, have been found to lower crime rates 
because they exert a positive effect; others, such as taverns 
and bars, can help destabilize neighborhoods and increase 
the rate of violent crimes such as rape and robbery.131
Public Social Control Stable neighborhoods are also 
able to arrange for external sources of social control. If they 
can draw on outside help and secure external resources—a 
process referred to as public social control—they are better 
able to reduce the effects of disorganization and maintain 
lower levels of crime and victimization.132 Racial differences 
in crime and violence rates may be explained in part by the 
ability of citizens in affl uent, predominantly white neigh-
borhoods to use their economic resources, and the politi-
cal power they bring, to their own advantage. They demand 
and receive a level of protection in their communities that is 
not enjoyed in less affl uent minority communities.133
The level of policing, one of the primary sources of pub-
lic social control, may vary from neighborhood to neigh-
borhood. The police presence is typically greatest when 
community organizations and local leaders have suffi cient 
political clout to get funding for additional law enforcement 
personnel. An effective police presence sends a message that 
the area will not tolerate deviant behavior. Because they 
can respond vigorously to crime, the police prevent crimi-
nal groups from gaining a toehold in the neighborhood.134 
Criminals and drug dealers avoid such areas and relocate to 
easier and more appealing targets.135 In contrast, crime rates 
are highest in areas where police are mistrusted because 
they engage in misconduct, such as use of excessive force, 
or because they are seemingly indifferent to neighborhood 
problems.136
In more disorganized areas, the absence of political 
powerbrokers limits access to external funding and protec-
tion.137 Without outside funding, a neighborhood may lack 
the ability to get back on its feet.138 In these areas, there 
are fewer police, and those that do patrol the area are less 
motivated and their resources are stretched tighter. These 
communities cannot mount an effective social control effort 
because as neighborhood disadvantage increases, the level 
of informal social control decreases.139
signifi cantly more likely to perceive their immediate surround-
ings in more negative terms (i.e., higher levels of incivilities) 
than those living in areas that maintain collective effi cacy.116 
When community social control efforts are blunted, crime 
rates increase, further weakening neighborhood cohesive-
ness.117 There are actually three forms of collective effi cacy: 
informal, institutional, and public social control.
Informal Social Control Some elements of collective ef-
fi cacy operate on the primary or private level and involve 
peers, families, and relatives. These sources exert informal 
control by either awarding or withholding approval, respect, 
and admiration. Informal control mechanisms include direct 
criticism, ridicule, ostracism, desertion, or physical punish-
ment.118 Because they already have a propensity to commit 
crime without informal social controls, some people will be 
unable to avoid entanglements in antisocial behaviors.119
The most important wielder of informal social control 
is the family, which may keep at-risk kids in check through 
such mechanisms as corporal punishment, withholding 
privileges, or ridiculing lazy or disrespectful behavior. The 
importance of the family to apply informal social control 
takes on greater importance in neighborhoods with few so-
cial ties among adults and limited collective effi cacy. In these 
areas, parents cannot call upon neighborhood resources to 
take up the burden of controlling children and face the bur-
den of providing adequate supervision.120
The family is not the only force of informal social control. 
In some neighborhoods, people are committed to preserving 
their immediate environment by confronting destabilizing 
forces such as teen gangs.121 By helping neighbors become 
more resilient and self-confi dent, adults in these areas provide 
the external support systems that enable youth to desist from 
crime. Residents teach one another that they have moral and 
social obligations to their fellow citizens; children learn to be 
sensitive to the rights of others and to respect differences.
In some areas, neighborhood associations and self-help 
groups form.122 The threat of skyrocketing violence rates 
may draw people together to help each other out. While 
criminologists believe that crime rates are lower in cohesive 
neighborhoods, it is also possible that an escalating crime 
rate may bring people closer together to fight a common 
problem.123 Some neighbors may get involved in informal 
social control through surveillance practices, for example, 
by keeping an eye out for intruders when their neighbors go 
out of town. Informal surveillance has been found to reduce 
the levels of some crimes such as street robberies; however, 
if robbery rates remain high, surveillance may be terminated 
because people become fearful for their safety.124
Institutional Social Control Social institutions such as 
schools and churches cannot work effectively in a climate 
of alienation and mistrust. Unsupervised peer groups and 
gangs, which fl ourish in disorganized areas, disrupt the infl u-
ence of those neighborhood control agents that do exist.125
People who reside in these neighborhoods find that

they feel a sense of obligation to maintain order themselves 
and are more willing to work hard to encourage informal 
social control. In areas where social institutions and pro-
cesses—such as police protection—are working adequately, 
residents are willing to intervene personally to help control 
unruly children and uncivil adults.148
In contrast, in disorganized areas, the population is tran-
sient and people want to leave as soon as they can afford to 
fi nd better housing. Interpersonal relationships remain su-
perfi cial, and people are less willing to help out neighbors or 
exert informal controls over their own or neighbors’ children. 
Social institutions such as schools and churches cannot work 
effectively in a climate of alienation and mistrust.149 Children 
who live in these neighborhoods fi nd that involvement with 
conventional social institutions, such as schools and after-
noon programs, is blocked; they are instead at risk for re-
cruitment into gangs.150 These problems are stubborn and 
diffi cult to overcome. And even when an attempt is made 
to revitalize a disorganized neighborhood by creating institu-
tional support programs such as community centers and bet-
ter schools, the effort may be countered by the ongoing drain 
of deep-rooted economic and social deprivation.151
According to the social ecology school, then, the quality 
of community life, including levels of change, fear, incivility, 
poverty, and deterioration, has a direct infl uence on an area’s 
crime rate. It is not some individual property or trait that 
causes people to commit crime, but the quality and ambi-
ence of the community in which they reside. Conversely, in 
areas that have high levels of social control and collective 
effi cacy, crime rates have been shown to decrease—no mat-
ter what the economic situation. Concept Summary 6.1 sets 
out the features of social disorganization theory.

“Broken Windows,” which discusses the concept

Justice CourseMate at cengagebrain.com, then access the

The government can also reduce crime by providing eco-
nomic and social supports through publicly funded social 
support and welfare programs. Though welfare is often criti-
cized by conservative politicians as being a government hand-
out, there is evidence of a signifi cant association between the 
amount of welfare money people receive and lowered crime 
rates.140 Government assistance may help people improve 
their social status by providing them with the fi nancial re-
sources to clothe, feed, and educate their children while at the 
same time reducing stress, frustration, and anger. Using gov-
ernment subsidies to reduce crime is controversial and not all 
research has found that it actually works as advertised.141
People living in disorganized areas may also be able 
to draw on resources from their neighbors in more affl u-
ent surrounding communities, helping to keep crime rates 
down.142 This phenomenon may explain, in part, why vi-
olence rates are high in poor African American neighbor-
hoods cut off from outside areas for support.143
The Effect of Collective Efficacy In areas where collective 
effi cacy remains high, children are less likely to become in-
volved with deviant peers and engage in problem behaviors.144 
In these more stable areas, kids are able to use their wits to 
avoid violent confrontations and to feel safe in their own 
neighborhood, a concept referred to as street effi cacy.145 This 
association is important because adolescents living in commu-
nities with high levels of effi cacy are less likely to resort to vio-
lence themselves or to associate with delinquent peers.146
In contrast, adolescents who live in neighborhoods with 
concentrated disadvantage and low collective effi cacy begin 
to lose confi dence in their ability to avoid violence. They 
perceive, and rightly so, that the community cannot provide 
the level of social control needed to neutralize or make up 
for what individuals lack in personal self-control.147 The 
lack of community controls may convince them to take mat-
ters in their own hands—for example, joining a gang or car-
rying a weapon for self-protection.
Collective effi cacy has other benefi ts. When residents are 
satisfi ed that their neighborhoods are good places to live,

aggression and hostility and, eventually, leads to violence 
and crime. The effect of inequality may be greatest when the 
impoverished population believes they are becoming less 
able to compete in a society where the balance of economic 
and social power is shifting further toward the already affl u-
ent. Under these conditions, the likelihood that the poor will 
choose illegitimate life-enhancing activities increases.156 The 
basic components of strain theory are set out in Figure 6.6.
Strain theories come in two distinct formulations:
Structural strain
 
■
. Using a sociological lens, structural 
strain suggests that economic and social sources of 
strain shape collective human behavior.
Individual strain
 
■
. Using a psychological reference, 
individual strain theories suggest that individual life 
experiences cause some people to suffer pain and 
misery, feelings that are then translated into antisocial 
behaviors.
The Concept of Anomie
The roots of strain theories can be traced to Émile Dur-
kheim’s notion of anomie (from the Greek a nomos, “with-
out norms”). According to Durkheim, an anomic society is 
one in which rules of behavior (i.e., values, customs, and 
norms) have broken down or become inoperative during 
periods of rapid social change or social crisis such as war or 
famine. Anomie is most likely to occur in societies that are 
moving from a preindustrial society, which is held together 
by traditions, shared values, and unquestioned beliefs (i.e., 
mechanical solidarity) to a postindustrial social system, 
which is highly developed and dependent upon the divi-
sion of labor. In this modern society, people are connected 
by their interdependent needs for one 
another’s services and production (i.e., 
 organic solidarity). The shift in tradi-
tions and values creates social turmoil. 
Established norms begin to erode and 
lose meaning. If a division occurs be-
tween what the population expects and 
what the economic and productive forces 
of society can realistically deliver, a crisis 
situation develops that can manifest itself 
in normlessness or anomie. This condi-
tion can be found in modern day Russia 
as it shifts from a Communist system to a 
free enterprise system without the social 
support and guarantees the population 
has come to expect.157
Anomie undermines society’s social 
control function. Every society works to 
limit people’s goals and desires. If a so-
ciety becomes anomic, it can no longer 
establish and maintain control over its 
population’s wants and desires. Because 
STRAIN THEORIES
As a group, strain theorists believe that most people share 
similar values and goals. They want to earn money, have a 
nice home, drive a great car, and wear stylish clothes. They 
also want to care for their families and educate their chil-
dren. Unfortunately, the ability to achieve these personal 
goals is stratifi ed by socioeconomic class. While the affl uent 
may live out the American Dream, the poor are shut out 
from achieving their goals. Because they can’t always get 
what they want, they begin to feel frustrated and angry, a 
condition that is referred to as strain.
Strain is related to criminal motivation. People who feel 
economically and socially humiliated may perceive the right 
to humiliate others in return.152 Psychologists warn that 
under these circumstances those who consider themselves 
“losers” begin to fear and envy “winners” who are doing 
very well at their expense. If they fail to take risky aggressive 
tactics, they are surely going to lose out in social competi-
tion and have little chance of future success.153 These gen-
eralized feelings of relative deprivation are precursors to 
high crime rates.154
According to the strain view, sharp divisions between 
the rich and poor create an atmosphere of envy and mistrust 
that may lead to violence and aggression.155 People who 
feel deprived because of their race or economic class stand-
ing eventually develop a sense of injustice and discontent. 
The less fortunate begin to distrust the society that has nur-
tured social inequality and obstructed their chances of pro-
gressing by legitimate means. The constant frustration that 
results from these feelings of inadequacy produces pent-up 
John Ziebell yells at Immigration Day protest marchers as they pass by his home in New 
Haven, Connecticut, on May 1, 2007. Ziebell was angry because, he said, he was 
unemployed and has been unable to find a job. According to strain theory, conflict results 
when, because of rapid changes in society, a gulf develops between personal goals and the 
means available to achieve them. The result: alienation and conflict.

CHAPTER 6 | Social Structure Theories  205
In the United States, Merton argued, legitimate means 
to acquire wealth are stratifi ed across class and status lines. 
Those with little formal education and few economic re-
sources soon fi nd that they are denied the ability to legally 
acquire wealth—the preeminent success symbol. When so-
cially mandated goals are uniform throughout society and 
access to legitimate means is bound by class and status, 
the resulting strain produces anomie among those who are 
locked out of the legitimate opportunity structure. Conse-
quently, they may develop criminal or delinquent solutions 
to the problem of attaining goals.
Social Adaptations Merton argued that each person has 
his or her own concept of the goals of society and the means 
at his or her disposal to attain them. Table 6.2 shows Merton’s 
diagram of the hypothetical relationship between social goals, 
the means for getting them, and the individual actor. Here is a 
brief description of each of these modes of adaptation:
Conformity. 
 
■
Conformity occurs when individuals both 
embrace conventional social goals and also have the 
means at their disposal to attain them. The conform-
ist desires wealth and success and can obtain them 
through education and a high paying job. In a balanced, 
stable society, this is the most common social adapta-
tion. If a majority of its people did not practice confor-
mity, the society would cease to exist.
Innovation. 
 
■
Innovation occurs when an individual accepts 
the goals of society but rejects or is incapable of attaining 
them through legitimate means. Many people desire ma-
terial goods and luxuries but lack the fi nancial ability to 
attain them. The resulting confl ict forces them to adopt 
innovative solutions to their dilemma: they steal, sell 
drugs, or extort money. Of the fi ve adaptations, innova-
tion is most closely associated with criminal behavior.
If successful, innovation can have serious, long-term 
social consequences. Criminal success helps convince oth-
erwise law-abiding people that innovative means work 
better and faster than conventional ones. The prosperous 
drug dealer’s expensive car and fl ashy clothes give out the 
message that crime pays. Merton claims, “The process thus 
enlarges the extent of anomie within the system, so that oth-
ers, who did not respond in the form of deviant behavior to 
the relatively slight anomie which they fi rst obtained, come 
to do so as anomie is spread and is intensifi ed.”160 This ex-
plains why crime is initiated and sustained in certain low-
income ecological areas.
Ritualism. 
 
■
Ritualists have gained the tools to accu-
mulate wealth—for example, they are educated and 
informed—but reject established cultural goals of 
contemporary society. These are people who enjoy 
the routine of work without having the ambition to 
climb to the top of their profession; they are not risk 
takers. Some may enjoy being mid-level government 
bureaucrats. They are the professors who want to get 
people fi nd it diffi cult to control their appetites, their de-
mands become unlimited. Under these circumstances, 
obedience to legal codes may be strained, and alternative 
behavior choices, such as crimes, may be inevitable.
Merton’s Theory of Anomie
Durkheim’s ideas were applied to criminology by sociolo-
gist Robert Merton in his theory of anomie.158 Merton used 
a modifi ed version of the concept of anomie to fi t social, 
economic, and cultural conditions found in modern U.S. 
society.159 He found that two elements of culture interact to 
produce potentially anomic conditions: culturally defi ned 
goals and socially approved means for obtaining them. Con-
temporary society stresses the goals of acquiring wealth, 
success, and power. Socially permissible means include hard 
work, education, and thrift.
Poverty
Relative deprivation
Feelings of inadequacy
Siege mentality
Maintenance of conventional rules and norms
Despite adversity, people remain loyal to
conventional values and rules of dominant
middle-class culture.
Strain
People who desire conventional success but lack means
and opportunity will experience strain and frustration.
Formation of gangs and groups
People form law-violating groups to seek alternative
means of achieving success.
Crime and delinquency
People engage in antisocial acts to achieve success and
relieve their feelings of strain.
Criminal careers
Feelings of strain may endure, sustaining criminal careers.

206  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Evaluation of Anomie The-
ory According to anomie 
theory, social inequality leads 
to perceptions of anomie. To 
resolve the goals–means con-
flict and relieve their sense 
of strain, some people inno-
vate by stealing or extorting 
money, others retreat into 
drugs and alcohol, others 
rebel by joining revolutionary 
groups, and still others get 
involved in ritualistic behav-
ior by joining a religious cult.
Merton’s view of anomie 
has been one of the most en-
during and infl uential socio-
logical theories of criminality. 
By linking deviant behavior 
to the success goals that con-
trol social behavior, anomie 
theory attempts to pinpoint 
the cause of the confl ict that 
produces personal frustration 
and consequent criminality. 
By acknowledging that so-
ciety unfairly distributes the 
legitimate means to achiev-
ing success, anomie theory 
helps explain the existence of high-crime areas and the ap-
parent predominance of delinquent and criminal behavior 
among the lower class. By suggesting that social conditions, 
not individual personalities, produce crime, Merton greatly 
infl uenced the direction taken to reduce and control crimi-
nality during the latter half of the twentieth century.
A number of questions are left unanswered by anomie 
theory.161 Merton does not explain why people choose to 
commit certain types of crime. For example, why does one 
anomic person become a mugger and another deal drugs? 
tenure, but do not strive to become chairperson of the 
department. Some ritualists gain pleasure from prac-
ticing traditional ceremonies regardless of whether 
they have a real purpose or goal. The rules and cus-
toms in religious orders, clubs, and college fraterni-
ties are appealing to ritualists. Ritualists should have 
the lowest level of criminal behavior because they 
have abandoned the success goal, which is at the root 
of criminal activity.
Retreatism. 
 
■
Retreatists reject both the goals and the 
means of society. Merton suggests that people who 
adjust in this fashion are “in the society but not of it.” 
Included in this category are “psychotics, psychoneu-
rotics, chronic autists, pariahs, outcasts, vagrants, vaga-
bonds, tramps, chronic drunkards, and drug addicts.” 
Because such people are morally or otherwise incapable 
of using both legitimate and illegitimate means, they 
attempt to escape their lack of success by withdrawing, 
either mentally or physically.
Rebellion. 
 
■
Rebellion involves substituting an alternative 
set of goals and means for conventional ones. Revolu-
tionaries who wish to promote radical change in the 
existing social structure and who call for alternative 
lifestyles, goals, and beliefs are engaging in rebellion. 
Rebellion may be a reaction against a corrupt and hated 
government or an effort to create alternate opportuni-
ties and lifestyles within the existing system.
Merton describes a number of adaptations to the anomie caused by the disjunction of goals and means. 
Here, children stand among the tents set up in a shantytown being built in the Liberty City neighborhood 
in Miami, Florida, October 24, 2006. Several organizations and individuals occupied the public land to 
build the shantytown to serve the needs of the poor African American community in the wake of a 
government housing scandal. The lot had been vacant for years since the city of Miami purchased, and 
subsequently demolished, the low-rent apartment complex that had been located at the site. Which of 
Merton’s adaptations best describes this social action?

exceedingly high national crime rate, is that anomic condi-
tions have been allowed to “develop to such an extraordinary 
degree.”166 There do not seem to be any alternatives that 
would serve the same purpose or strive for the same goal.
Impact of Anomie Why does anomie pervade American 
culture? According to Messner and Rosenfeld, it is because 
capitalist culture promotes intense pressures for economic 
success. Prosocial, noneconomic institutions that might oth-
erwise control the exaggerated emphasis on fi nancial success, 
such as religious or charitable institutions, have been ren-
dered powerless or obsolete. As a result, the value structure 
of society is dominated by economic realities that weaken 
institutional social control. In other words, people are so in-
terested in making money that their behavior cannot be con-
trolled by the needs of family or the restraints of morality.
There are three reasons social institutions have been under-
mined. First, noneconomic functions and roles have been de-
valued. Performance in other institutional settings—the family, 
school, or community—is assigned a lower priority than the 
goal of fi nancial success. Few students go to college to study 
the classics; most want to major in a fi eld with good job pros-
pects. Second, when confl icts emerge, noneconomic roles be-
come subordinate to and must accommodate economic roles. 
The schedules, routines, and demands of the workplace take 
priority over those of the home, the school, the community, 
and other aspects of social life. A parent given the opportunity 
for a promotion thinks nothing of uprooting his family and 
moving them to another part of the country. And third, eco-
nomic language, standards, and norms penetrate into noneco-
nomic realms. Economic terms become part of the common 
vernacular. People want to get to the “bottom line”; spouses 
view themselves as “partners” who “manage” the household. 
Retired people say they want to “downsize” their household; 
we “outsource” home repairs instead of doing them ourselves. 
Corporate leaders run for public offi ce promising to “run the 
country like a business.” People join social clubs to make con-
nections and “network,” not to make close friends.
According to Messner and Rosenfeld, the relatively high 
U.S. crime rates can be explained by the interrelationship 
between culture and institutions. The dominance of the 
American Dream mythology ensures that many people will 
develop wishes and desires for material goods that cannot 
be satisfi ed by legitimate means. People are willing to do 
anything to get ahead, from cheating on tests to get higher 
grades to engaging in corporate fraud and tax evasion.167 
Those who cannot succeed become willing to risk every-
thing, including a prison sentence.
The American Dream mythos may have a different effect 
on people depending on their place in the social structure. 
In their analysis of survey data, Stephen Cernkovich and his 
associates found that the American Dream mythology had a 
greater effect on whites than African Americans. Cernkovich 
reasons that whites may have greater expectations of mate-
rial success than African Americans, whose aspirations have 
been tempered by a long history of racial and economic 
Anomie may be used to explain differences in crime rates, 
but it cannot explain why most young criminals desist from 
crime as adults. Does this mean that perceptions of anomie 
dwindle with age? Is anomie short-lived?
Critics have also suggested that people pursue a num-
ber of different goals, including educational, athletic, and 
social success. Juveniles may be more interested in imme-
diate goals, such as having an active social life or being a 
good athlete, than in long-term “ideal” achievements, such 
as monetary success. Achieving these goals is not a matter 
of social class alone; other factors, including athletic ability, 
intelligence, personality, and family life, can either hinder or 
assist goal attainment.162 Anomie theory also assumes that 
all people share the same goals and values, which is false.163
Some contemporary theories are grounded on Merton’s 
visionary concepts. Some of these are macro-level theories 
that hold that the success goal integrated within American 
society influences the nature and extent of the aggregate 
crime rate. There are also individual micro-level versions of 
the theory, which focus on how an individual is affected by 
feelings of alienation and strain.
Macro-Level Strain Theory: 
Institutional Anomie Theory
An important addition to the strain literature is the book 
Crime and the American Dream, by Steven Messner and Rich-
ard Rosenfeld.164 Their macro-level version of anomie the-
ory views antisocial behavior as a function of cultural and 
institutional infl uences in U.S. society, a model they refer 
to as institutional anomie theory. Messner and Rosenfeld 
agree with Merton’s view that the success goal is pervasive 
in American culture. They refer to this as the American 
Dream, a term they employ as both a goal and a process. 
As a goal, the American Dream involves accumulating mate-
rial goods and wealth via open individual competition. As a 
process, it involves both being socialized to pursue material 
success and believing that prosperity is an achievable goal in 
American culture. In the United States, the capitalist system 
encourages innovation in pursuit of monetary rewards. Busi-
nesspeople such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Donald 
Trump are considered national heroes and leaders. Anomic 
conditions occur because the desire to succeed at any cost 
drives people apart, weakens the collective sense of commu-
nity, fosters ambition, and restricts desires to achieve any-
thing that is not material wealth. Achieving a “good name” 
and respect is not suffi cient. Capitalist culture “exerts pres-
sures toward crime by encouraging an anomic cultural en-
vironment, an environment in which people are encouraged 
to adopt an ‘anything goes’ mentality in the pursuit of per-
sonal goals . . . the anomic pressures inherent in the Ameri-
can Dream are nourished and sustained by an institutional 
balance of power dominated by the economy.”165

Messner and Rosenfeld, and what most likely determines the

the crime rate, Agnew explains why individuals who feel 
stress and strain are more likely to commit crimes. Agnew 
also offers a more general explanation of criminal activity 
among all elements of society rather than restricting his 
views to lower-class crime.173
Multiple Sources of Stress Agnew suggests that crimi-
nality is the direct result of negative affective states—the 
anger, frustration, and adverse emotions that emerge in the 
wake of negative and destructive social relationships. He 
fi nds that negative affective states are produced by a variety 
of sources of strain (Figure 6.7):
Failure to achieve positively valued goals. 
 
■
This category of 
strain, similar to what Merton speaks of in his theory 
of anomie, is a result of the disjunction between aspira-
tions and expectations. This type of strain occurs when 
people aspire for wealth and fame, but, lacking fi nancial 
and educational resources, assume that such goals are 
impossible to achieve. These people, wracked by de-
spair, who feel few opportunities for success, are at risk 
for crime.174
Disjunction of expectations and achievements. 
 
■
Strain can 
also be produced when there is a disjunction between 
expectations and achievements. When people compare 
themselves to peers who seem to be doing a lot better 
fi nancially or socially (such as making more money or 
getting better grades), even those doing relatively well 
feel strain. For example, when a high school senior is 
accepted at a good college but not a “prestige school” 
like some of her friends, she will feel strain. Perhaps she 
is not being treated fairly because the “playing fi eld” is 
tilted against her; “other kids have connections,” she 
may say. Perceiving inequity may result in adverse reac-
tions, ranging from running away from its source to 
deprivation. When whites experience strain, they are more 
apt to react with anger and antisocial behavior.168
Institutional Effects At the institutional level, the domi-
nance of economic concerns weakens the informal social 
control exerted by the family, church, and school. These in-
stitutions have lost their ability to regulate behavior and have 
instead become a conduit for promoting material success. 
Parents push their kids to succeed at any cost; schools en-
courage kids to get into the best colleges; religious institutions 
promote their wealth and power.169 Crime rates may rise even 
in a healthy economy because national prosperity heightens 
the attractiveness of monetary rewards, encouraging people 
to gain fi nancial success by any means possible, including il-
legal ones. Meanwhile, the importance of social institutions as 
a means of exerting social control is reduced. In this “culture 
of competition,” self-interest prevails and generates amorality, 
acceptance of inequality, and disdain for the less fortunate.170
The Messner-Rosenfeld version of anomie strain may be 
a blueprint for crime-reduction strategies: if citizens are pro-
vided with an economic safety net, they may be able to re-
sist the infl uence of economic deprivation and commit less 
crime. Nations that provide such resources—welfare, pen-
sion benefi ts, health care—have signifi cantly lower crime 
rates.171 In contrast, crime and violence rates are highest in 
nations that experience high levels of income inequality.172

wronged and produces a desire for revenge, energizes indi-
viduals to take action, and lowers inhibitions. Violence and 
aggression seem justifi ed if you have been wronged and are 
righteously angry.
Because it produces these emotions, strain can be con-
sidered a predisposing factor for criminality when it is 
chronic and repetitive and creates a hostile, suspicious, and 
aggressive attitude. Individual strain episodes may serve as 
a situational event or trigger that produces crime, such as 
when a particularly stressful event ignites a violent reaction. 
Strain may predispose people toward antisocial behaviors 
rather than cause them to commit a specifi c act to relieve 
strain. So the person who feels strain because of fi nancial 
need may be as likely to beat up a rival as he is to rob a 
liquor store.182
Sources of Strain
There are a variety of sources of strain. Sometimes it can 
be a particular individual who is causing problems, such 
as a peer group rival. When individuals identify a target to 
blame for their problems, they are more likely to respond 
with retaliatory action (for example, “Joe stole my wife 
away by lying about me, so I beat him up!”). Sometimes 
the source of strain is diffi cult to pinpoint (for example, “I 
feel depressed because of the way the world is going”); this 
type of ambiguous strain is unlikely to produce an aggres-
sive response.183
Social Sources of Strain People may begin to feel strain 
because of their membership in a peer or social group. The 
relationship may be reciprocal. People who report feelings of 
stress and anger are more likely to interact with others who 
are similarly stressed out.184 Peer group membership has its 
benefi ts, such as friendship, companionship, and support, 
but such groups also force members into behavior patterns 
(such as using drugs) that can be the source of unwelcome 
stress. Feelings of strain and being overwhelmed may be-
come magnifi ed as individuals attempt to comply with peer 
group demands. People may, for example, get involved in an 
unwanted shoplifting spree to pay for drugs, creating even 
more stress in their lives.185 Experiments show that people 
who perceive strain because they are being treated unfairly 
report (1) high levels of situational anger that lead to (2) 
higher levels of theft from an employer.186 People who live 
in strain-producing social conditions are more likely to cope 
with their negative emotions through crime.187
People who perceive strain because their success goals 
are blocked are more likely to engage in criminal activi-
ties.188 This association is universal: research efforts con-
ducted in foreign locales (such as Italy and South Korea) 
have found support for an association between strain and 
involvement in criminal acts.189 Though some culture-based 
differences have been found, the basic premises of the GST 
do not seem culture bound.190
lowering the benefi ts of others through physical attacks 
or vandalizing their property.
Removal of positively valued stimuli. 
 
■
Strain may occur 
because of the actual or anticipated removal or loss of 
a positively valued stimulus from the individual. Di-
vorce can produce strain, as can the death of a loved 
one, moving to a new neighborhood, or getting a new 
job. The loss of positive stimuli may lead to criminality 
when a person tries to prevent the loss, retrieve what 
has been lost, obtain substitutes, or seek revenge against 
those responsible for the loss.175
The effect of removal of positive stimuli may be 
class bound. Middle-class people are less able to cope 
with the removal of positive stimuli. When you are ex-
pected to succeed because of your class position, failure 
may be harder to swallow; those who have limited op-
portunities and lower expectations may be able to take 
failure in stride.176
Presentation of negative stimuli.
 
■
 While the GST recog-
nizes that the removal of positive stimuli produces 
strain, it relies more heavily on the effects of negative 
or noxious stimuli. Included within this category are 
such pain-inducing social interactions as child abuse 
and neglect, crime victimization, physical punishment, 
family and peer confl ict, school failure, and interaction 
with stressful life events ranging from family breakup, 
unemployment, moving, feelings of dissatisfaction 
with friends and school to verbal threats and air pol-
lution.177 Becoming the target of racism and dis-
crimination may also trigger the anger and aggression 
predicted by Agnew.178
Another important source of negative stimuli is 
to experience violent crime fi rsthand. Agnew himself 
found evidence that the strain associated with becom-
ing a crime victim and anticipating future victimization 
may cause people to embrace antisocial behavior.179 
People who are victims of violent crimes may develop 
angry emotionality that translates into anger and subse-
quent antisocial behaviors.180
The effect of negative stimuli is not always a one-shot 
deal but may be ongoing. Some people who feel con-
stantly picked on and maltreated by others will become 
detached and sullen. And even though they are angry 
and disengaged, they may be forced to interact with the 
source of strain, such as their boss, on a regular basis. 
Because this is unpleasant, they get angry and frustrated 
and plan corrective action: they can assault or seek 
revenge against the source of their strain or even self-
medicate by using drugs and alcohol.181
According to Agnew, the greater the intensity and fre-
quency of strain experiences, the greater their impact and 
the more likely they are to cause criminality. Each type of 
strain will increase the likelihood of experiencing such 
negative emotions as disappointment, depression, fear, and, 
most important, anger. Anger increases perceptions of being

210  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Strain and Criminal Careers While some people can effec-
tively cope with strain, how does GST explain both chronic 
offending and the stability of crime over the life course? GST 
recognizes that certain people have traits that may make 
them particularly sensitive to strain. These include an explo-
sive temperament, being overly sensitive or emotional, low 
tolerance for adversity, and poor problem-solving skills.195
Aggressive people who have these traits are likely to 
have poor interpersonal skills and are more likely to be 
treated negatively by others; their combative personalities 
make them feared and disliked. These people are likely to 
live in families whose caretakers share similar personality 
traits. They are also more likely to reject conventional peers 
and join deviant groups. Such individuals are subject to a 
high degree of strain over the course of their lives.
Crime peaks during late adolescence because this is a 
period of social stress caused by the weakening of paren-
tal supervision and the development of relationships with 
a diverse peer group. Peers may help soften the blow of 
strainful events or may exacerbate their impact. Kids who 
fi nd themselves the target of stressful life events may be at 
greater risk to crime when they turn to peers who them-
selves are involved in criminality.196 Agnew created the con-
cept of storylines to help explain how people deal with the 
stressors of everyday life. This concept is discussed in The 
Criminological Enterprise.
Many kids going through the trauma of family breakup 
and frequent changes in family structure fi nd themselves 
feeling a high degree of strain. They may react by becoming 
involved in precocious sexuality or by turning to substance 
abuse to mask the strain. For example, research shows 
that young girls of any social class are more likely to bear 
out-of-wedlock children if they themselves experienced an 
unstable family life.197 Adolescence is also a period during 
which hormone levels peak, and the behavior moderating 
aspects of the brain have not fully developed—two factors 
that make adolescent males susceptible to environmental 
sources of strain.198
As they mature, children’s expectations increase; some 
fi nd that they are unable to meet academic and social de-
mands. Adolescents are very concerned about their stand-
ing with peers. Those defi cient in these areas may fi nd they 
are social outcasts, another source of strain. In adulthood, 
crime rates drop because these sources of strain are reduced, 
new sources of self-esteem emerge, and adults seem more 
likely to bring their goals in line with reality.
Explaining continuity and change in offending rates 
over the life course has become an important goal of 
criminologists. Analysis of latent trait and life course 
theories in Chapter 9 provides some recent thinking on 
this topic.
CONNECTIONS
Community Sources of Strain The GST generally focuses 
on individual-level sources of strain, yet there are distinct 
ecological variations in the crime rate. Some regions, cities, 
and neighborhoods are more crime prone than others. Can 
ecological differences produce “negative affective states” in 
large segments of the population, which account for these 
differences? Agnew suggests that there are, in fact, commu-
nity-level factors, such as blocked opportunities and lack of 
social support, that produce feelings of strain. According to 
Agnew, communities contribute to strain in several ways:
They infl uence the goals people pursue and the ability 
 
■
people have to meet these goals.
They infl uence feelings of relative deprivation and ex-
 
■
posure to aversive stimuli, including family confl ict, 
incivility, and economic deprivation.
They infl uence the likelihood that angry, strain-fi lled 
 
■
individuals will interact with one another.
Consequently, not only does GST predict deviance on an in-
dividual level, but it can also account for community-level 
differences in the crime rate.
Coping with Strain
Not all people who experience strain fall into a life of crime 
and eventually resort to criminality. Some are able to marshal 
their emotional, mental, and behavioral resources to cope 
with the anger and frustration produced by strain. Coping 
ability may be a function of both individual traits and per-
sonal experiences over the life course. Personal tempera-
ment, prior learning of antisocial attitudes and behaviors, 
and association with criminal peers who reinforce anger are 
among other factors affecting the ability to cope. People who 
are impulsive and lack attachments to others are less able 
to cope than those who are bonded to others and maintain 
higher levels of self-control.191 Those high in negative emo-
tionality and low in constraint will be more likely to react to 
strain with antisocial behaviors.192 In contrast, those people 
who can call on family, friends, and social institutions for 
help and support are better able to cope with strain.193
Although it may be socially disapproved, criminality can 
provide relief and satisfaction for someone living an other-
wise stress-fi lled life. Using violence for self-protection may 
increase feelings of self-worth among those who feel inad-
equate or intellectually insecure.194
Some defenses are cognitive; individuals may be able to 
rationalize frustrating circumstances. Not getting the career 
they desire is “just not that important”; they may be poor, 
but the “next guy is worse off”; and if things didn’t work 
out, then they “got what they deserved.” Others seek be-
havioral solutions: they run away from adverse conditions 
or seek revenge against those who caused the strain. Oth-
ers will try to regain emotional equilibrium with techniques 
ranging from physical exercise to drug abuse.

demands that debts be repaid, gambling 
losses, drug binges, or the pressure to 
pay legal fines or fees. So this storyline 
might go: “I knew the Knicks were going 
to beat the Celtics, so I borrowed $500 
for a bet, and then they lost on a lucky 
shot. I had to pay the loan back so I 
stole my brother-in-law’s plasma TV and 
sold it on the street.”
An Unresolved Dispute. 
 
■
This storyline 
begins when someone does or says 
something that the individual does not 
like, or challenges and/or threatens a 
core identity value or status. The indi-
vidual experiences one or more negative 
emotions, such as anger and humilia-
tion, and then finds someone to blame 
for this negative treatment. This type of 
storyline often has a romantic twist: “I 
thought someone was hitting on my girl, 
because she was acting very strange. I 
thought she was trying to hook up with 
someone and I was really upset. Then 
I saw this guy with her. I was afraid she 
was going to be unfaithful, so I hit him in 
the face with a pipe.”
A Brief but Close Involvement with a 
 
■
Criminal Other(s). Individuals often de-
velop close associations with criminal 
others over long periods of time, but 
sometimes the associations are more 
fleeting—lasting only hours, days, or 
weeks. This storyline can have a number 
of elements. The individual gets involved 
with another individual or group who 
entices them into committing a crime 
they would never have committed on 
their own. Success in a crime might lead 
to invitations for other crimes. Using this 
storyline, a person might say, “I was in a 
bar drinking when these guys I met told 
me that I could get some great weed for 
only $100 an ounce. I usually don’t do 
things like that, but the price seemed so 
good I couldn’t pass it up.”
A Brief, Tempting Opportunity for Crime. 
 
■
Individuals may develop or encounter 
tempting opportunities for crime that 
last from several hours to weeks. Being 
tempted means that the cost of crime is 
perceived as being low while the ben-
efits are high and that this advantaged 
circumstance will persist for some time. 
This storyline might be, “I know this guy 
who is working as a security guard in an 
electronics store. He will sell me video 
games for $10 each that I know I can 
peddle on the street for $30. He can get 
me 50 games next week. Why pass up 
an easy $1,000? And besides, I can’t get 
in trouble because I didn’t really take the 
stuff myself.”
Of course, individuals may experience 
more than one storyline at a time, each one 
contributing to or influencing another: a kid 
runs away from home, creating a desperate 
need for money; this gets him into disputes 
with other kids on the street, putting him in 
temporary contact with antisocial peers, and 
creates tempting opportunities for crime.
Agnew believes that storylines are the 
key to understanding the immediate cause 
of crime. The ebb and flow of storylines, 
partly a function of luck and chance, help 
explain why some people commit crime, 
then stop, only to start again. They also help 
us understand the context of crime, why it 
occurs in some situations and not others. 
A person may commit a violent act when he 
or she is in the midst of a domestic crisis, 
but resolve the same situation peacefully at 
another point in his or her life.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. What storylines do college students use 
when they cheat on tests? Smoke pot? 
Get drunk at a frat party? Are they simi-
lar to Agnew’s vision?
 2. If people use storylines to get involved 
in crime, are there ones that prevent or 
inhibit illegal activities?

Storylines
Criminologist Robert Agnew has identified 
a concept—storylines—to help explain why 
people commit crimes. He finds that when 
criminals are asked why they offend, they 
typically tell a story explaining why they en-
gaged in crime. These stories describe the 
stressful events and conditions leading up 
to the crime and how they dealt with the 
pressure and strain. Very often it is some 
unusual or unplanned event that led them 
to feel strain and resort to criminal actions to 
solve their problems: they were insulted by 
a rival and sought revenge; they lost money 
gambling and, needing to pay off their debt, 
had to commit a burglary; some guy was 
hitting on their girl so they were forced to 
give them a beatdown. A storyline is a tem-
porally limited, interrelated set of events and 
conditions that increases the likelihood that 
individuals will engage in a crime or a series 
of related crimes.
Storylines begin with a particular event; 
that is, “something happens” that is upset-
ting. This event affects the characteristics 
of the individual, leads to increased feel-
ings of strain, and alters their associations 
and interactions. The feeling was tempo-
rary; they may claim “that’s not really like 
me.” They turn into a new person—jealous, 
angry, desperate, violent—that is out of 
character. The storyline ends when some 
event restores the individual’s normal level 
of functioning, ending the temporary drama 
in their lives.
What are some typical stories that are 
told?
A Desperate Need for Money.
 
■
 Offenders 
often report that they engage in crime 
during those periods when something 
has happened that creates a temporary 
but desperate need for money, and the 
individual believes that there are no 
good legitimate options for obtaining 
such money. Usually cited for this turn 
of events are unexpected expenses, poor 
budgeting between paydays, temporary 
employment problems, the temporary 
loss of other sources of financial support,

212  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Evaluating GST
Agnew’s work is important because it both clarifies the 
concept of strain and directs future research agendas. The 
model has been shown to predict crime and deviance within 
a number of subject, racial, gender, and age groups.199 It 
also addresses the dynamic nature of criminal behavior: lev-
els of strain vary over the life course and so do crime rates. 
As levels of strain increase, so does involvement in antisocial 
activities; as strain levels decrease, so do individual crime 
rates. Feelings of strain then appear to play a key role in of-
fending continuity and change.200
One of the biggest question marks about GST is its abil-
ity to adequately explain gender differences in the crime 
rate. Females experience as much or more strain, frustra-
tion, and anger as males, but their crime rate is much lower. 
Is it possible that there are gender differences either (a) in 
the relationship between strain and criminality or (b) in the 
ability to cope with the effects of strain? Not all sources of 
strain produce the anger envisioned by Agnew.201 Although 
females may experience more strain, males may be more 
deeply affected by interpersonal stress.202
There is evidence that stress infl uences both males and 
females equally; however, the degree to which it leads to 
criminal behavior is much higher among males than fe-
males.203 When presented with similar types of strain, males 
and females respond with a different constellation of nega-
tive emotions.204 Females may be socialized to internalize 
stress, blaming themselves for their problems; males may 
take the same type of strain and relieve it by striking out 
at others and defl ecting criticism with aggression.205 Con-
sequently, males may resort to criminality in the face of 
stressors of any magnitude, but only extreme levels of strain

seek out their peers when they are faced with strain, whereas

is certainly needed to understand the cross-gender impact 
of strain.207
These issues aside, general strain theory has proven to 
be an enduring vision of the cause of criminality. Research-
ers have continued to show that people who perceive strain 
are the ones most likely to engage in delinquent activity.208

CULTURAL DEVIANCE 
THEORIES
The third branch of social structure theory combines the 
effects of social disorganization and strain to explain how 
people living in deteriorated neighborhoods react to social 
isolation and economic deprivation. Because their lifestyle is 
draining, frustrating, and dispiriting, members of the lower 
class create an independent subculture with its own set of 
rules and values. Middle-class culture stresses hard work,

CHAPTER 6 | Social Structure Theories  213
Focal Concerns
In his classic 1958 paper, “Lower Class Culture as a Gener-
ating Milieu of Gang Delinquency,” Walter Miller identifi ed 
the unique value system that defi nes lower-class culture.214 
Conformance to these focal concerns dominates life among 
the lower class. According to Miller, clinging to lower-class 
focal concerns promotes illegal or violent behavior. Tough-
ness may mean displaying fi ghting prowess; street smarts 
may lead to drug deals; excitement may result in drinking, 
gambling, or drug abuse. Focal concerns do not necessar-
ily represent a rebellion against middle-class values; rather, 
these values have evolved specifi cally to fi t conditions in 
lower-class areas. The major lower-class focal concerns are 
set out in Exhibit 6.1.215 The Profi les in Crime feature “A 
Life in the Drug Trade” illustrates how lower-class focal con-
cerns shape behavior in the inner city.
It is this adherence to the prevailing cultural demands 
of lower-class society that causes urban crime. Research, in 
fact, shows that members of the lower class value tough-
ness and want to show they are courageous in the face of 
provocation.216 A reputation for toughness helps them ac-
quire social power while at the same time insulating them 
from becoming victims. Violence is also seen as a means to 
acquire the accouterments of wealth (nice clothes, fl ashy 
cars, or access to clubs), control or humiliate another per-
son, defy authority, settle drug-related “business” disputes, 
delayed gratification, formal educa-
tion, and being cautious; the lower-class 
subculture stresses excitement, tough-
ness, risk taking, fearlessness, immedi-
ate gratifi cation, and “street smarts.” The 
lower-class subculture is an attractive 
alternative because the urban poor fi nd 
that it is impossible to meet the behav-
ioral demands of middle-class society.
Unfortunately, subcultural norms of-
ten clash with conventional values. Peo-
ple who have close personal ties to the 
neighborhood, especially when they are 
to deviant networks such as gangs and 
criminal groups, may fi nd that commu-
nity norms interfere with their personal 
desire for neighborhood improvement. 
So when the police are trying to solve a 
gang-related killing, neighbors may fi nd 
that their loyalty to the gang boy and 
his family outweighs their desire to cre-
ate a more stable crime-free community 
by giving information to the police.209 
Figure 6.8 outlines the elements of cul-
tural deviance theory.
Conduct Norms
The concept that the lower class develops a unique culture 
in response to strain can be traced to Thorsten Sellin’s classic 
1938 work, Culture Confl ict and Crime, a theoretical attempt 
to link cultural adaptation to criminality.210 Sellin’s main 
premise is that criminal law is an expression of the rules of 
the dominant culture. The content of the law, therefore, may 
create a clash between conventional, middle-class rules and 
splinter groups, such as ethnic and racial minorities who are 
excluded from the social mainstream. These groups main-
tain their own set of conduct norms—rules governing the 
day-to-day living conditions within these subcultures.211 
Conduct norms can be found in almost any culture and are 
not the property of any particular group, culture, or political 
structure.
Complicating matters is the fact that most of us belong 
to several social groups. In a complex society, the number 
of groups people belong to—family, peer, occupational, and 
religious—is quite large. “A confl ict of norms is said to ex-
ist when more or less divergent rules of conduct govern the 
specifi c life situation in which a person may fi nd himself.”212 
According to Sellin, culture confl ict occurs when the rules 
expressed in the criminal law clash with the demands 
of group conduct norms. To make his point, Sellin cited 
the case of a Sicilian father in New Jersey who killed the 
16-year-old boy who seduced his daughter and then ex-
pressed surprise at being arrested. He claimed that he had 
“merely defended his family honor in a traditional way.”213

According to cultural deviance theory, gangs flourish in an environment where there is strain 
and social disorganization. They provide an alternative for neighborhood kids who feel they 
can never make it in the legitimate world. Here, Los Angeles police officers question a 
17-year-old gang member caught associating with another member and violating his 
probation. The boy was handcuffed and taken to the Rampart police station for a hearing 
with a probation officer. Local residents have a deep-seated resentment of the LAPD. The 
area is known for its violent gangs, which compete for the lucrative drug trade. Los Angeles’s 
violent crime rates, traditionally among the highest in California, have recently fallen as 
gangs have shifted to outlying counties where real estate prices are more affordable. Does 
that mean that crime-producing inner-city norms and values will be spreading to 
surrounding areas and infecting them with inner-city problems?

labels status frustration.219 As a result, many of them join 
together in gangs and engage in behavior that is “nonutili-
tarian, malicious, and negativistic.”220
Cohen viewed the delinquent gang as a separate subcul-
ture, possessing a value system directly opposed to that of 
the larger society. He describes the subculture as one that 
“takes its norms from the larger culture, but turns them up-
side down. The delinquent’s conduct is right by the stan-
dards of his subculture precisely because it is wrong by the 
norms of the larger cultures.”221
attain retribution, satisfy the need for thrills or risk taking, 
and respond to challenges to one’s manhood.217
To some criminologists, the infl uence of lower-class fo-
cal concerns and culture seems as relevant today as when 
first identified by Miller almost 50 years ago. The Race, 
Culture, Gender, and Criminology feature “The Code of the 
Streets” discusses a recent version of the concept of cultural 
deviance.
Theory of Delinquent Subcultures
Albert Cohen fi rst articulated the theory of delinquent sub-
cultures in his classic 1955 book, Delinquent Boys.218 Cohen’s 
central position was that delinquent behavior of lower-class 
youths is actually a protest against the norms and values of 
middle-class U.S. culture. Because social conditions make 
them incapable of achieving success legitimately, lower-class 
youths experience a form of culture conflict that Cohen

FIGURE 6.8
Elements of Cultural Deviance Theory
EXHIBIT 6.1
Miller’s Lower-Class Focal Concerns
Trouble
In lower-class communities, people are evaluated by their 
actual or potential involvement in making trouble. Getting 
into trouble includes such behavior as fighting, drinking, 
and sexual misconduct. Dealing with trouble can confer 
prestige—for example, when a man establishes a reputation 
for being able to handle himself well in a fight. Not being able 
to handle trouble, and having to pay the consequences, can 
make a person look foolish and incompetent.
Toughness
Lower-class males want local recognition of their physical and 
spiritual toughness. They refuse to be sentimental or soft and 
instead value physical strength, fighting ability, and athletic 
skill. Those who cannot meet these standards risk getting a 
reputation for being weak, inept, and effeminate.
Smartness
Members of the lower-class culture want to maintain an 
image of being streetwise and savvy, using their street smarts, 
and having the ability to outfox and out-con the opponent. 
Though formal education is not admired, knowing essential 
survival techniques, such as gambling, conning, and 
outsmarting the law, is a requirement.
Excitement
Members of the lower class search for fun and excitement to 
enliven an otherwise drab existence. The search for 
excitement may lead to gambling, fighting, getting drunk, and 
sexual adventures. In between, the lower-class citizen may 
simply “hang out” and “be cool.”
Fate
Lower-class citizens believe their lives are in the hands of 
strong spiritual forces that guide their destinies. Getting lucky, 
finding good fortune, and hitting the jackpot are all slum 
dwellers’ daily dreams.
Autonomy
Being independent of authority figures, such as the police, 
teachers, and parents, is required. Losing control is an

impress authority fi gures, such as teachers, employers, or 
supervisors. Cohen calls the standards set by these author-
ity fi gures middle-class measuring rods. The confl ict and 
frustration lower-class youths experience when they fail to 
meet these standards is a primary cause of delinquency. For 
example, the fact that a lower-class student is deemed by 
those in power to be substandard or below the average of 
what is expected can have an important impact on his or 
her future life chances. A school record may be reviewed 
by juvenile court authorities and by the military. Because 
a military record can infl uence whether or not someone is 
qualifi ed for certain jobs, it is quite infl uential.222 Negative 
evaluations become part of a permanent fi le that follows an 
individual for the rest of his or her life. When he or she 
wants to improve, evidence of prior failures is used to dis-
courage advancement.
According to Cohen, the development of the delin-
quent subculture is a consequence of socialization prac-
tices found in the ghetto or inner-city environment. These 
children lack the basic skills necessary to achieve social 
and economic success in the demanding U.S. society. They 
also lack the proper education and therefore do not have 
the skills upon which to build a knowledge or socializa-
tion foundation. He suggests that lower-class parents are 
incapable of teaching children the necessary techniques 
for entering the dominant middle-class culture. The conse-
quences of this deprivation include developmental handi-
caps, poor speech and communication skills, and inability 
to delay gratifi cation.
Middle-Class Measuring Rods One signifi cant handicap 
that lower-class children face is the inability to positively 
told the jury that he headed a group of 
heroin vendors who did business from his 
“spot,” his sales area, between Daly and 
Honeywell Avenues in the Bronx. He said 
he had learned the trade from a stepfather, 
a building superintendent who he said had 
a second job as a narcotics entrepreneur: 
“I always knew about the drug business. I 
was raised around it.”
As a mid-level drug dealer, Vega re-
ceived heroin on consignment from big-time 
drug wholesalers and turned it over in $100 
packages to people he called his “manag-
ers,” who in turn found “runners” to sell 
it on the street. His job was to “make sure 
everybody is working, and I will make sure 
everything is running correctly.” Vega re-
ceived a “commission” of about 35 percent 
of all sales in his organization; he estimated 
that he made a total of at least $500,000 in 
the five years before his arrest.
Vega told how he used strict rules to run 
his organization. He did not sell between 
1 and 3 P.M. because of “school hours.” 
He did not allow anyone to sell at his spot 
without his approval, or steal drugs from 
him, or pass him a counterfeit bill, or taint 
the quality of drugs sold under his name. 
If that happened, he said, “I’d be looking 
like a fool. The drug spot will go down.” 
When Manny, one of his workers, stole 
one package of heroin, Vega slashed his 
face with a box cutter. When the wound 
did not immediately bleed, “I didn’t see 
nothing cut, I didn’t see anything I did, so 
I did it a second time,” he said, until he 
saw blood. Angered by a counterfeit bill he 
received from a crack addict, “I punched 
him in the face, I kicked him, I threw him 
on the floor and kicked him again.” He dis-
ciplined one stranger who cheated him by 
hitting the man in the back of the head with 
a three-foot tree branch. Police informants 
were given special treatment. “In the drug 
world, in the drug law, we say that snitches 
get stitches,” he said. “In jail, you cut their 
face. In the street, you beat them. You kill 
them.”
Vega testified that the defendants Quiño-
nes and Rodriguez were heroin wholesalers 
and that he began buying drugs from them 
a few months before Santiago’s death. After 
he learned that Quiñones suspected San-
tiago of working undercover for the police, 
he helped him lure Santiago to the apart-
ment of a girlfriend where the beatings and 
murder took place. For his cooperation, 
Vega faced a 15-year sentence rather than 
the death penalty.

of Life as Drug Dealer,” New York Times,

A Life in the Drug Trade
In summer 2004, a dramatic murder trial 
took place in New York City that aptly illus-
trates how lower-class cultural concerns—
the code of the streets—clash with the 
rules and values of American culture and 
how deviant cultures can exist side by side 
with middle-class culture.
Two Bronx men, Alan Quiñones and Di-
ego Rodriguez, were accused of heroin traf-
ficking and killing a police informant. The 
trial hinged on the testimony of one of their 
confederates—Hector Vega, a key govern-
ment witness who had previously pleaded 
guilty to taking part in the murder. He de-
scribed in vivid detail how he watched the 
defendants beat the victim, Edwin San-
tiago, as he lay handcuffed on the floor of a 
Bronx apartment. He told the jury how the 
defendants Quiñones and Rodriguez spit in 
Santiago’s face to show what they thought 
of police informants. Santiago’s body was 
found mutilated and burned beyond recog-
nition on June 28, 1999.
During the trial, Vega gave the jury a 
detailed lesson in retail drug operations. In 
the Bronx, beatings, slashings, and shoot-
ings are routinely used to enforce what he 
called “the drug law”: “If people deserved 
it, I beat them up.” He showed them a 
tattoo on his upper right arm that meant 
“Money, Power, Respect.” Vega, 31, also

216  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
A widely cited view of the interrelationship 
of culture and behavior is Elijah Anderson’s 
concept of the “code of the streets.” He sees 
that life circumstances are tough for the 
“ghetto poor”—lack of jobs that pay a living 
wage, stigma of race, fallout from rampant 
drug use and drug trafficking, and alienation 
and lack of hope for the future. Living in 
such an environment places young people 
at special risk of crime and deviant behavior.
There are two cultural forces running 
through the neighborhood that shape their 
reactions. Decent values are taught by 
families committed to middle-class values 
and representing mainstream goals and 
standards of behavior. Though they may 
be better off financially than some of their 
street-oriented neighbors, they are gener-
ally “working poor.” They value hard work 
and self-reliance and are willing to sacrifice 
for their families; they harbor hopes for a 
better future for their children. Most go to 
church and take a strong interest in educa-
tion. Some see their difficult situation as a 
test from God and derive great support from 
their faith and from the church community.
In opposition, street values are born 
in the despair of inner-city life and are in 
opposition to those of mainstream society. 
The street culture has developed what An-
derson calls a code of the streets, a set of 
informal rules setting down both proper at-
titudes and ways to respond if challenged. 
If the rules are violated, there are penalties 
and sometimes violent retribution.
At the heart of the code is the issue of 
respect—loosely defined as being “treated 
right.” The code demands that disrespect 
be punished or hard-won respect will be 
lost. With the right amount of respect, a 
person can avoid being bothered in pub-
lic. If he is bothered, not only may he be in 
physical danger, but he has been disgraced 
or “dissed” (disrespected). Some forms of 
dissing, such as maintaining eye contact 
for too long, may seem pretty mild. But 
to street kids who live by the code, these 
actions become serious indications of the 
other person’s intentions and a warning of 
imminent physical confrontation.
These two orientations—decent and 
street—socially organize the community. 
Their coexistence means that kids who 
are brought up in decent homes must be 
able to successfully navigate the demands 
of the street culture. Even in decent fami-
lies, parents recognize that the code must 
be obeyed or at the very least negotiated; it 
cannot simply be ignored.
The Respect Game
Young men in poor inner-city neigh-
borhoods build their self-image on the 
foundation of respect. Having “juice” 
(as respect is sometimes called on the 
street) means that they can take care of 
themselves even if it means resorting to 
violence. For street youth, losing respect 
on the street can be damaging and dan-
gerous. Once they have demonstrated that 
they can be insulted, beaten up, or stolen 
from, they become an easy target. Kids 
from decent families may be able to keep 
their self-respect by getting good grades 
or a scholarship. Street kids do not have 
that luxury. With nothing to fall back on, 
they cannot walk away from an insult. 
They must retaliate with violence.
One method of preventing attacks is to go 
on the offensive. Aggressive, violence-prone 
people are not seen as easy prey. Robbers 
do not get robbed, and street fighters are not 
the favorite targets of bullies. A youth who 
communicates an image of not being afraid 
to die and not being afraid to kill has given 
himself a sense of power on the street.
Anderson’s work has been well received 
by the criminological community. A number 
of researchers have found that the “code of 
the streets” does in fact exist and that An-
derson’s observations are in fact valid. Jef-
fery Fagan’s interviews with 150 young men 
who had experiences with violent crimes 
while living in some of New York City’s 
toughest neighborhoods found that many 
alternated their demeanor between “de-
cent” and “street” codes of behavior. Both 
orientations existed side by side within the 
same individuals. The street code’s rules 
for getting and maintaining respect through 
aggressive behavior forced many “decent” 
youths to situationally adopt a tough de-
meanor and perhaps behave violently in 
order to survive an otherwise hostile and 
possibly dangerous environment.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Does the code of the street, as de-
scribed by Anderson, apply in the 
neighborhood in which you were raised? 
That is, is it universal?
 2. Is there a form of “respect game” being 
played out on college campuses? If so, 
what is the substitute for violence?

The Formation of Deviant Subcultures Cohen believes 
lower-class boys who suffer rejection by middle-class deci-

cultures: the corner boy, the college boy, or the delinquent 
boy. The corner boy role is the most common response to 
middle-class rejection. The corner boy is not a chronic de-
linquent, but may be a truant who engages in petty or sta-
tus offenses, such as precocious sex and recreational drug 
abuse. His main loyalty is to his peer group, on which he 
depends for support, motivation, and interest. His values,

CHAPTER 6 | Social Structure Theories  217
Youth gangs are an important part of the delinquent sub-
culture. Although not all illegal acts are committed by gang 
youth, they are the source of the most serious, sustained, 
and costly criminal behaviors. Delinquent gangs spring up 
in disorganized areas where youths lack the opportunity to 
gain success through conventional means.
True to strain theory principles, Cloward and Ohlin por-
tray inner-city kids as individuals who want to conform to 
middle-class values but lack the means to do so.229
Differential Opportunities The centerpiece of the 
Cloward and Ohlin theory is the concept of differential 
 opportunity, which states that people in all strata of society 
share the same success goals but that those in the lower class 
have limited means of achieving them. People who perceive 
themselves as failures within conventional society will seek 
alternative or innovative ways to gain success. People who 
conclude that there is little hope for advancement by legiti-
mate means may join with like-minded peers to form a gang. 
Gang members provide the emotional support to handle the 
shame, fear, or guilt they may develop while engaging in 
illegal acts. Delinquent subcultures then reward these acts 
that conventional society would punish. The youth who is 
considered a failure at school and is only qualifi ed for a me-
nial job at a minimum wage can earn thousands of dollars 
plus the respect of his or her peers by joining a gang and 
engaging in drug deals or armed robberies.
Cloward and Ohlin recognize that the opportunity for 
both successful conventional and criminal careers is limited. 
In stable areas, adolescents may be recruited by professional 
criminals, drug traffi ckers, or organized crime groups. Un-
stable areas, however, cannot support fl ourishing criminal 
opportunities. In these socially disorganized neighborhoods, 
adult role models are absent, and young criminals have few 
opportunities to join established gangs or to learn the fi ne 
points of professional crime. Cloward and Ohlin’s most im-
portant fi nding, then, is that all opportunities for success, 
both illegal and conventional, are closed for the most “truly 
disadvantaged” youth.
Because of differential opportunity, kids are likely to join 
one of three types of gangs:
Criminal gangs. 
 
■
Criminal gangs exist in stable lower-
class areas in which close connections among ado-
lescent, young adult, and adult offenders create an 
environment for successful criminal enterprise.230 
Youths are recruited into established criminal gangs that 
provide a training ground for a successful criminal ca-
reer. Gang membership provides a learning experience 
in which the knowledge and skills needed for success in 
crime are acquired. During this “apprenticeship stage,” 
older, more experienced members of the criminal sub-
culture hold youthful “trainees” on tight reins, limiting 
activities that might jeopardize the gang’s profi ts (for ex-
ample, engaging in nonfunctional, irrational violence). 
Over time, new recruits learn the techniques and at-
titudes of the criminal world and how to “cooperate 
therefore, are those of the group with which he is in close 
personal contact. The corner boy, well aware of his failure to 
achieve the standards of the American Dream, retreats into 
the comforting world of his lower-class peers and eventually 
becomes a stable member of his neighborhood, holding a 
menial job, marrying, and remaining in the community.
The college boy embraces the cultural and social val-
ues of the middle class. Rather than scorning middle-class 
measuring rods, he actively strives to be successful by those 
standards. Cohen views this type of youth as one who is em-
barking on an almost hopeless path, since he is ill-equipped 
academically, socially, and linguistically to achieve the re-
wards of middle-class life.
The delinquent boy adopts a set of norms and principles 
in direct opposition to middle-class values. He engages in 
short-run hedonism, living for today and letting “tomorrow 
take care of itself.”223 Delinquent boys strive for group au-
tonomy. They resist efforts by family, school, or other sources 
of authority to control their behavior. They may join a gang 
because it is perceived as autonomous, independent, and the 
focus of “attraction, loyalty, and solidarity.”224 Frustrated by 
their inability to succeed, these boys resort to a process Cohen 
calls reaction formation. Symptoms of reaction formation in-
clude overly intense responses that seem disproportionate to 
the stimuli that trigger them. For the delinquent boy, this takes 
the form of irrational, malicious, and unaccountable hostility 
to the enemy, which in this case are “the norms of respectable 
middle-class society.”225 Reaction formation causes delinquent 
boys to overreact to any perceived threat or slight. They sneer 
at the college boy’s attempts at assimilation and scorn the cor-
ner boy’s passivity. The delinquent boy is willing to take risks, 
violate the law, and fl out middle-class conventions.
Cohen’s work helps explain the factors that promote and 
sustain a delinquent subculture. By introducing the concepts 
of status frustration and middle-class measuring rods, Co-
hen makes it clear that social forces and not individual traits 
promote and sustain a delinquent career. By introducing the 
corner boy, college boy, delinquent boy triad, he helps ex-
plain why many lower-class youth fail to become chronic 
offenders: there is more than one social path open to indi-
gent youth.226 His work is a skillful integration of strain and 
social disorganization theories and has become an enduring 
element of the criminological literature.
Theory of Differential Opportunity
In their classic work Delinquency and Opportunity, written 
50 years ago, Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin combined 
strain and social disorganization principles into a portrayal 
of a gang-sustaining criminal subculture.227 Cloward and 
Ohlin agreed with Cohen and found that independent de-
linquent subcultures exist within society. They consider a 
delinquent subculture to be one in which certain forms of 
delinquent activity are essential requirements for perform-
ing the dominant roles supported by the subculture.228

tried crime or violence but are too 
clumsy, weak, or scared to be accepted 
in criminal or violent gangs. They then 
retreat into a role on the fringe of soci-
ety. Members of the retreatist subculture 
constantly search for ways of getting 
high—alcohol, pot, heroin, unusual sex-
ual experiences, music. They are always 
“cool,” detached from relationships with 
the conventional world. To feed their 
habit, retreatists develop a “hustle”—
pimping, conning, selling drugs, and 
committing petty crimes. Personal status 
in the retreatist subculture is derived 
from peer approval.
Evaluating Social 
Structure Theories
The social structure approach has signif-
icantly influenced both criminological 
theory and crime-prevention strategies. 
Its core concepts seem to be valid in 
view of the relatively high crime and 
delinquency rates and gang activity oc-
curring in the deteriorated inner-city areas of the nation’s 
largest cities.234 The public’s image of the disorganized in-
ner city includes roaming bands of violent teenage gangs, 
drug users, prostitutes, muggers, and similar frightening 
examples of criminality. All of these are present today in 
inner-city areas.
Critics of the approach charge that we cannot be sure 
that it is lower-class culture itself that promotes crime and 
not some other force operating in society. They deny that 
residence in urban areas alone is suffi cient to cause people 
to violate the law.235 It is possible, they counter, that lower-
class crime rates may be an artifact of bias in the criminal 
justice system. Lower-class areas seem to have higher crime 
rates because residents are arrested and prosecuted by 
agents of the justice system who, as members of the middle 
class, exhibit class bias.236 Class bias is often coupled with 
discrimination against minority group members, who have 
long suffered at the hands of the justice system.
Even if the higher crime rates recorded in lower-class 
areas are valid, it is still true that most members of the 
lower class are not criminals. The discovery of the chronic 
offender indicates that a signifi cant majority of people liv-
ing in lower-class environments are not criminals and that a 
relatively small proportion of the population commits most 
crimes. If social forces alone could be used to explain crime, 
how can we account for the vast number of urban poor who 
remain honest and law abiding? Given these circumstances, 
law violators must be motivated by some individual mental, 
physical, or social process or trait.237
successfully with others in criminal enterprises.”231 To 
become a fully accepted member of the criminal gang, 
novices must prove themselves reliable and dependable 
in their contacts with their criminal associates.
Confl ict gangs. 
 
■
Confl ict gangs develop in communities 
unable to provide either legitimate or illegitimate op-
portunities. These highly disorganized areas are marked 
by transient residents and physical deterioration. Crime 
in this area is “individualistic, unorganized, petty, poorly 
paid, and unprotected.”232 There are no successful adult 
criminal role models from whom youths can learn crimi-
nal skills. When such severe limitations on both criminal 
and conventional opportunity intensify frustrations of the 
young, violence is used as a means of gaining status. The 
image of the confl ict gang member is the swaggering, 
tough adolescent who fi ghts with weapons to win respect 
from rivals and engages in unpredictable and destructive 
assaults on people and property. Confl ict gang members 
must be ready to fi ght to protect their own and their 
gang’s integrity and honor. By doing so, they acquire a 
“rep,” which provides them with a means for gaining ad-
miration from their peers and consequently helps them 
develop their own self-image. Confl ict gangs, according 
to Cloward and Ohlin, “represent a way of securing ac-
cess to the scarce resources for adolescent pleasure and 
opportunity in underprivileged areas.”233
Retreatist gangs.

to gain success through legitimate means and unwill-
ing to do so through illegal ones. Some retreatists have

Kids may join gangs because they are looking for acceptance and respect. The gang may 
serve as a surrogate family. By providing an alternative, community programs hope to entice 
kids away from gangs. Some programs have a religious theme. Here, the Venerable Khon 
Sao, a Buddhist monk, teaches Cambodian youths, many of them gang members, how 
to pray at a Buddhist temple in Lowell, Massachusetts. In conjunction with the police 
department, the temple has begun a program that teaches teens the fundamentals of 
Buddhist thought two evenings a week. In the classes, the youths learn how to pray, 
meditate, and act peacefully.

CHAPTER 6 | Social Structure Theories  219
It is also questionable whether a distinct lower-class 
culture actually exists. Several researchers have found that 
gang members and other delinquent youths seem to value 
middle-class concepts, such as sharing, earning money, and 
respecting the law, as highly as middle-class youths. Crimi-
nologists contend that lower-class youths also value educa-
tion as highly as middle-class students do.238 Public opinion 
polls can also be used as evidence that a majority of lower-
class citizens maintain middle-class values. National surveys 
fi nd that people in the lowest income brackets want tougher 
drug laws, more police protection, and greater control over 
criminal offenders.239 These opinions seem similar to con-
ventional middle-class values rather than representative of an 
independent, deviant subculture. While this evidence con-
tradicts some of the central ideas of social structure theory, 
the discovery of stable patterns of lower-class crime, the high 
crime rates found in disorganized inner-city areas, and the 
rise of teenage gangs and groups support a close association 
between crime rates and social class position. Concept Sum-
mary 6.3 sets out the features of cultural deviance theories.

IMPLICATIONS OF SOCIAL

Social structure theory has had a significant influence

to criminal behavior can be provided by giving inner-city 
dwellers opportunities to share in the rewards of conven-
tional society.
One approach is to give indigent people direct fi nan-
cial aid through welfare programs that assist needy families. 
Although welfare has been curtailed through the Federal 
Welfare Reform Act of 1996, research shows that crime 
rates decrease when families receive supplemental income 
through public assistance payments.240
There are also efforts to reduce crime by improving the 
community structure in high-crime inner-city areas. Crime-
prevention efforts based on social structure precepts can be 
traced back to the Chicago Area Project, supervised by Clif-
ford R. Shaw. This program attempted to organize existing 
community structures to develop social stability in other-
wise disorganized lower-class neighborhoods. The project 
sponsored recreation programs for children in the neigh-
borhoods, including summer camping. It campaigned for 
community improvements in such areas as education, sani-
tation, traffi c safety, physical conservation, and law enforce-
ment. Project members also worked with police and court 
agencies to supervise and treat gang youth and adult offend-
ers. In a 25-year assessment of the project, Solomon Kobrin 
found that it was successful in demonstrating the feasibility 
of creating youth welfare organizations in high-delinquency 
areas.241 Kobrin also discovered that the project made a dis-
tinct contribution to ending the isolation of urban males 
from the mainstream of society.
Social structure concepts, especially Cloward and Ohlin’s 
views, were a critical ingredient in the Kennedy and Johnson 
administrations’ “War on Poverty,” begun in the early 1960s. 
Rather than organizing existing community structures, as 
Shaw’s Chicago Area Project had done, this later effort called 
for an all-out attack on the crime-producing structures of

the country. Weed and Seed sites range in size from several 
neighborhood blocks to 15 square miles.242 The strategy 
involves a two-pronged approach. First, law enforcement 
agencies and prosecutors cooperate in “weeding out” crimi-
nals who participate in violent crime and drug abuse, and 
attempt to prevent their return to the targeted area. Then, 
participating agencies begin “seeding,” which brings human 
services to the area, encompassing prevention, intervention, 
treatment, and neighborhood revitalization. A community-
oriented policing component bridges weeding and seeding 
strategies. Offi cers obtain helpful information from area res-
idents for weeding efforts while they aid residents in obtain-
ing information about community revitalization and seeding 
resources. Operation Weed and Seed is an example of a 
modern-day crime-control approach that relies on changing 
neighborhood structure to reduce crime rates.

of the inner-city area. They sought to reduce crime by devel-
oping a sense of community pride and solidarity in poverty 
areas and by providing educational and job opportunities 
for crime-prone youths. Some War on Poverty programs—
Head Start, Neighborhood Legal Services, and the Commu-
nity Action Program—have continued to help people.
Today, Operation Weed and Seed is the foremost struc-
tural theory–based crime-reduction strategy. Its aim is to 
prevent, control, and reduce violent crime, drug abuse, and 
gang activity in targeted high-crime neighborhoods across 
SUMMARY
 1. Be familiar with the different el-
ements of the social structure
People in the United States live 
 
■
in a stratifi ed society; social 
strata are created by the unequal 
distribution of wealth, power, 
and prestige. There are now 
40 million Americans living in 
poverty. The crushing lifestyle 
of lower-class areas produces a 
culture of poverty that is passed 
from one generation to the next 
and is stained by apathy, cyni-
cism, helplessness, and mistrust 
of social institutions. Children 
in these areas are hit especially 
hard by poverty. The burdens 
of underclass life are often felt 
most acutely by minority group 
members. Almost 25 percent 
of African Americans and 22 
percent of Latino Americans still 
live in poverty, compared to less 
than 10 percent of whites.
 2. Describe the association be-
tween social structure and crime
According to social structure 
 
■
theory, the root cause of crime 
can be traced directly to the 
socioeconomic disadvantages 
that have become embedded in 
American society. Lower-class 
people are driven to desperate 
measures, such as crime and 
substance abuse, to cope with 
their economic plight. Aggravat-
ing this dynamic is the constant 
media bombardment linking 
material possessions to self-
worth.
 3. Know the elements of social dis-
organization theory
Crime occurs in disorganized 
 
■
areas where institutions of so-
cial control, such as the family, 
commercial establishments, and 
schools, have broken down and 
can no longer perform their 
expected or stated functions. 
Indicators of social disorganiza-
tion include high unemploy-
ment and school dropout rates, 
deteriorated housing, low in-
come levels, and large numbers 
of single-parent households. 
Residents in these areas experi-
ence confl ict and despair, and, 
as a result, antisocial behavior 
fl ourishes.
 4. Be familiar with the views of 
Shaw and McKay
Shaw and McKay explained 
 
■
crime and delinquency within 
the context of the changing 
urban environment and eco-
logical development of the city. 
Poverty-ridden transitional 
neighborhoods suffered high 
rates of population turnover and 
were incapable of inducing resi-
dents to remain and defend the 
neighborhoods against criminal 
groups. The values that slum 
youths adopt often confl ict with 
existing middle-class norms, 
which demand strict obedience 
to the legal code. Consequently, 
a value confl ict further separates 
the delinquent youth and his 
or her peer group from con-
ventional society; the result is a 
more solid embrace of deviant 
goals and behavior.
 5. Know the various elements of 
ecological theory
Crime rates and the need for 
 
■
police services are associated 
with community deterioration: 
disorder, poverty, alienation, 
disassociation, and fear of crime. 
In larger cities, neighborhoods 
with a high percentage of de-
serted houses and apartments 
experience high crime rates. In 
disorganized neighborhoods 
that suffer social and physical

incivilities that cause fear, as 
fear increases, quality of life 
deteriorates. People who live in 
neighborhoods that experience 
high levels of crime and civil 
disorder become suspicious and 
mistrusting and may develop 
a “siege mentality.” As areas 
decline, residents fl ee to safer, 
more stable localities.
 6. Be able to discuss the associa-
tion between collective effi cacy 
and crime
Cohesive communities develop 
 
■
collective effi cacy: mutual trust, 
a willingness to intervene in the 
supervision of children, and the 
maintenance of public order. 
Some elements of collective ef-
fi cacy operate on the primary, 
or private, level and involve 
peers, families, and relatives. 
Communities that have col-
lective effi cacy attempt to use 
their local institutions to control 
crime. Stable neighborhoods are 
also able to arrange for external 
sources of social control, such as 
more police on patrol, that fur-
ther reduce crime rates.
 7. Discuss what is meant by the 
concept of strain
Strain theorists argue that al-
 
■
though social and economic 
goals are common to people in 
all economic strata, the ability 
to obtain these goals is class 
dependent. Most people in the 
United States desire wealth, 
material possessions, power, 
prestige, and other life comforts. 
Members of the lower class are 
unable to achieve these symbols 
of success through conventional 
means. Consequently, they feel 
anger, frustration, and resent-
ment, referred to collectively as 
strain.
 8. Know what Merton meant by 
the term anomie
Merton argues that in the 
 
■
United States legitimate means 
to acquire wealth are stratifi ed 
across class and status lines. 
Some people have inadequate 
means of attaining success; 
others who have the means 
reject societal goals. To resolve 
the goals–means confl ict and 
relieve their sense of strain, 
some people innovate by steal-
ing or extorting money; others 
retreat into drugs and alcohol; 
some rebel by joining revolu-
tionary groups; and still oth-
ers get involved in ritualistic 
behavior by joining a religious 
cult.
 9. Discuss the concept of negative 
affective states
Agnew suggests that criminal-
 
■
ity is the direct result of nega-
tive affective states—the anger, 
frustration, and adverse emo-
tions that emerge in the wake of 
destructive social relationships. 
He fi nds that negative affective 
states are produced by a variety 
of sources of strain, including 
the failure to achieve success, 
application of negative stimuli, 
and removal of positive stimuli.
 10. Discuss the elements of cultural 
deviance theory
Cultural deviance theory com-
 
■
bines elements of both strain 
and social disorganization 
theories. A unique lower-class 
culture has developed in disor-
ganized neighborhoods. These 
independent subcultures main-
tain unique values and beliefs 
that confl ict with conventional 
social norms. Criminal behavior 
is an expression of conformity 
to lower-class subcultural values 
and traditions, not a rebellion 
from conventional society. Sub-
cultural values are handed down 
from one generation to the 
next in a process called cultural 
transmission.

222  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
 1. Is there a “transition” area in your 
town or city? Does the crime rate 
remain constant in this neighbor-
hood regardless of the racial, eth-
nic, or cultural composition of its 
residents?
 2. Do you believe a distinct lower-
class culture exists? Do you know 
anyone who has the focal concerns 
Miller talks about? Did you 
experience elements of these focal 
concerns while you were in high 
school? Will forms of communica-
tion such as the Internet reduce 
cultural differences and create a 
more homogenous society, or are 
subcultures resistant to such 
infl uences?
 3. Do you agree with Agnew that 
there is more than one cause of 
strain? If so, are there other 
sources of strain that he did not 
consider?
 4. How would a structural theorist 
explain the presence of middle-
class crime?
 5. How would biosocial theories ex-
plain the high levels of violent 
crime in lower-class areas?

TEENAGER
Teenager Genarlow Wilson was an honor student and a gifted athlete, attractive, popular, and outgoing. He 
had a 3.2 grade point average, was all-conference in football, voted 11th-grade prom prince, and his senior 
year was capped off with a special honor when he was elected Douglas County High’s fi rst-ever homecoming 
king. Instead of going right to his college of choice, Genarlow instead served a sentence in a Georgia prison. 
His crime: engaging in consensual sex when he was 17 years old with a girl two years younger. Wilson was 
convicted of aggravated child molestation even though he and the girl were both minors at the time and the 
sex was clearly consensual.
Wilson engaged in oral sex with the girl during a wild party involving a bunch of kids, marijuana, and 
alcohol, all captured on videotape. The tapes made it clear the sex was voluntary and not coerced. Though the

as a misdemeanor, and without assistance from this 
court, will spend eight more years in prison, is a grave 
miscarriage of justice.3
Here we can see how social processes infl uence both the 
defi nition of what is to be considered a crime and who is 
to be considered a criminal. How people are socialized and 
how they are perceived by others are critical determinants of 
a person’s status and behavior. 
SOCIALIZATION AND CRIME
During the 1930s and 1940s, a group of sociologists began 
to link social-psychological interactions to criminological 
behavior. Sociological social psychology (also known as 
psychological sociology) is the study of human interactions 
and relationships that emphasizes such issues as group dy-
namics and socialization.
According to this school of thought, an individual’s re-
lationship to important social processes, such as education, 
family life, and peer relations, is the key to understanding 
human behavior. Poverty and social disorganization alone 
are not sufficient to cause criminal activity because, after 
all, many people living in the most deteriorated areas never 
commit criminal offenses. Something else is needed. Re-
search seemed to show that children who grow up in homes 
prosecutor favored leniency, Wilson refused a plea bargain because it would mean admitting he was a sexual 
predator, a charge he vehemently denied and that no one, including the prosecutor, believed was true. Ironically, 
if the couple had had sexual intercourse, it would have been considered a misdemeanor, but since oral sex was 
involved, the crime was considered a felony. An additional irony in the case: after Wilson was convicted, the 
Georgia law was changed, making consensual oral sex between minors a misdemeanor as well. But the new law 
did not apply retroactively. Instead of using his college scholarship, Wilson was sent to prison.1
Genarlow Wilson’s case shows how social interactions and process shape crime. He did not consider 
himself a criminal and even in court denied his culpability. Here is an exchange he had with the prosecutor 
during the trial:
Wilson:  Aggravated child molestation is when like a 60-year-some old man likes messing with 10-year-old 
girls. I’m 17, the girl was 15, sir. You call that child molestation, two years apart?
Barker: I didn’t write the law.
Wilson: I didn’t write the law, either.
Barker: That’s what the law states is aggravated child molestation, Mr. Wilson, not me.
Wilson:  Well, sir, I understand you’re just doing your job. I don’t blame you. . . . But do you think it’s fair? 
. . . Would you want your son on trial for something like this?2
S
Should Genarlow Wilson have been labeled a “sexual preda-
tor”? If he had engaged in a different type of sex act, the 
case would never have been made public. The law itself was 
designed to protect young girls from being abused by older 
men, not members of their own peer group with whom they 
were socializing freely. And if the act itself was so bad, why 
was it decriminalized a short time later? The bottom line: if 
the party had occurred a few months later, Genarlow Wil-
son would have been playing football at Georgia State Uni-
versity, and not sent to Georgia State Prison!
Genarlow Wilson was in fact labeled a sexual predator and 
sent to prison because those in power, who defi ne the law and 
control its process, decided that his behavior constituted a se-
rious crime, a felony. They could have just as easily ignored 
the action and let him go. It would have been just another case 
of teens behaving badly. But even powerful decision makers 
can change their minds and reassess labels. On June 9, 2007, 
a Georgia judge threw out Genarlow’s 10-year sentence and 
amended it to misdemeanor aggravated child molestation with 
a 12-month term, plus credit for time served. Under the rul-
ing, Genarlow, who had been behind bars for more than two 
years, would not be required to register as a sex offender. In 
making his decision, the Georgia judge stated:
If this court or any court cannot recognize the injustice 
of what has occurred here, then our court system has 
lost sight of the goal our judicial system has always 
strived to accomplish . . . justice being served in a fair 
and equal manner. . . . The fact that Genarlow Wilson 
has spent two years in prison for what is now classifi ed

type of environment develop poor emotional well-being, ex-
ternalizing problems, and antisocial behavior.7
Even those children living in so-called high-crime areas 
will be better able to resist the temptations of the streets if 
they receive fair discipline, care, and support from parents 
who provide them with strong, positive role models. None-
theless, living in a disadvantaged neighborhood places ter-
rifi c strain on family functioning, especially in single- parent 
families that experience social isolation from relatives, 
friends, and neighbors. Children who are raised within such 
distressed families are at risk for delinquency.8
The relationship between family structure and crime is 
critical when the high rates of divorce and single parents are 
considered. Today about 32 percent of children live in sin-
gle-family homes, and there are signifi cant racial differences 
in family structure (see Table 7.1).9 Family disruption or 
change can have a long-lasting impact on children. Research 
conducted in both the United States and abroad shows that 
children raised in homes with one or both parents absent 
may be prone to antisocial behavior.10 It is not surprising 
that the number of single-parent households in the popula-
tion is signifi cantly related to arrest rates.11
The Effects of Divorce Why is the effect of divorce or sep-
aration so devastating? Even if single mothers (or fathers) can 
make up for the loss of a second parent, it is diffi cult to do so 
and the chances of failure increase. Single parents may fi nd 
it diffi cult to provide adequate supervision, exposing kids to 
the negative effects of antisocial peers.12 Poorly supervised 
kids may be more prone to act impulsively and are therefore 
less able to employ self-control to restrain their activities.13
Living in a single-parent household has been linked to 
educational failure. Kids living with a single parent may re-
ceive less encouragement and less help with schoolwork. 
Poor school achievement and limited educational aspirations 
have been associated with delinquent behavior. Also, because 
they are receiving less attention as a result of having just one 
parent, these children may be more prone to rebellious acts, 
such as running away and truancy.14 Children in two-parent 
households, on the other hand, are more likely to want to go 
on to college than kids in single-parent homes.15
wracked by confl ict, attend inadequate schools, and/or asso-
ciate with deviant peers become exposed to procrime forces.
In this view, the key to understanding crime can be 
found in human socialization—the interactions people 
have with various organizations, institutions, and processes 
of society. Most people are infl uenced by their family rela-
tionships, peer group associations, educational experiences, 
and interactions with authority fi gures, including teachers, 
employers, and agents of the justice system. If these rela-
tionships are positive and supportive, people can succeed 
within the rules of society; if these relationships are dys-
functional and destructive, conventional success may be 
impossible, and criminal solutions may become a feasible 
alternative. Taken together, this view of crime is referred to 
as social process theory.
The infl uence of social process theories has endured be-
cause the relationship between social class and crime is still 
uncertain. Most residents of inner-city areas refrain from 
criminal activity, and few of those who do commit crimes 
remain persistent chronic offenders into their adulthood. If 
poverty were the sole cause of crime, then indigent adults 
would be as criminal as indigent teenagers. The association 
between economic status and crime has been called prob-
lematic because class position alone cannot explain crime 
rates.4 Today, more than 40 million Americans live below 
the poverty line. Even if we were to assume that all crimi-
nals come from the lower class—which they do not—it is 
evident that the great majority of the most indigent Amer-
icans do not commit criminal acts even though they may 
have a great economic incentive to do so. Relatively few 
adolescents living in the most deteriorated areas become 
persistent offenders; most kids who do commit crime desist 
when they reach adulthood despite the continuing pressure 
of poverty and social decay. Some other force, then, must be 
at work to explain why the majority of at-risk individuals 
do not become persistent criminal offenders and to explain 
why some who have no economic or social reason to com-
mit crime do so anyway.
Criminologists have long studied the critical elements 
of socialization to determine how they contribute to a bur-
geoning criminal career. Prominent among these elements 
are the family, the peer group, and the school.
Family Relations
For some time, family relationships have been considered 
a major determinant of behavior.5 In fact, there is abun-
dant evidence that parenting factors, such as the ability to 
communicate and to provide proper discipline, may play 
a critical role in determining whether people misbehave as 
children and even later as adults.
Youths who grow up in households characterized by 
confl ict and tension, and where there is a lack of familial 
love and support, are susceptible to the crime-promoting 
forces in the environment.6 Adolescents who live in this

daily pressures it creates for them, such as 
being unable to pay bills or acquire basic 
necessities such as adequate food, hous-
ing, clothing, and medical care. As parents 
become more emotionally distressed, they 
tend to interact with one another and their 
children in a more irritable and less sup-
portive fashion. These patterns of behavior 
increase instability in the marriage and also 
disrupt effective parenting practices, such 
as monitoring children’s activities and us-
ing consistent and appropriate disciplinary 
strategies. Marital instability and disrupted 
parenting, in turn, increase children’s risk 
of suffering developmental problems, such 
as depressed mood, substance abuse, and 
engaging in delinquent behaviors. These 
economic stress processes also decrease 
children’s ability to function in a competent 
manner in school and with peers.
The findings also show, however, that 
parents who remain supportive of one an-
other, and who demonstrate effective prob-
lem-solving skills in spite of hardship, can 
disrupt this negative process and shield 
their children and themselves from these 
adverse consequences of economic stress. 
These parenting skills can be taught and 
used by human service professionals to as-
sist families experiencing economic pres-
sure or similar stresses in their lives.
CRITICAL THINKING
To help deal with these problems, Conger 
advocates support for social policies that ad-
equately aid families during stressful times 
as they recover from downturns in the econ-
omy. He also advocates educating parents 
about effective strategies for managing the 
economic, emotional, and family relation-
ship challenges they will face when hard-
ship occurs. What would you add to the mix 
to improve family functioning in America?

Family Functioning and Crime
Rand Conger is one of the nation’s lead-
ing experts on family life. For the past two 
decades, he has been involved with four 
major community studies that have exam-
ined the influence of economic stress on 
families, children, and adolescents. In sum, 
these studies involve almost 1,500 families 
and over 4,000 individual family members 
who represent a diverse cross-section of 
society. The extensive information that has 
been collected on all of these families over 
time includes reports by family members, 
videotaped discussions in the home, and 
data from schools and other community 
agencies.
One thing that Conger and his associ-
ates have learned is that in all of these dif-
ferent types of families, economic stress 
appears to have a harmful effect on par-
ents and children. According to his Fam-
ily Stress Model of economic hardship, 
such factors as low income and income 
loss increase parents’ sadness, pessimism 
about the future, anger, despair, and with-
drawal from other family members. Eco-
nomic stress has this impact on parents’ 
social-emotional functioning through the 
The Criminological Enterprise
The Criminological Enterprise
Because their incomes may decrease substantially in the 
aftermath of marital breakup, some divorced mothers are 
forced to move to residences in deteriorated neighborhoods 
that may place children at risk of crime and drug abuse. In 
poor neighborhoods, single parents cannot call upon neigh-
borhood resources to take up the burden of controlling chil-
dren, and, as a result, a greater burden is placed on families 
to provide adequate supervision.16 Some groups (i.e., His-
panics, Asians) have been raised in cultures where divorce 
is rare and parents have less experience in developing child-
rearing practices that buffer the effects of family breakup on 
adolescent problem behavior.17
When a mother remarries, it does not seem to miti-
gate the effects of divorce on youth. Children living with 
a stepparent exhibit as many problems as youth in single-
parent families and considerably more problems than those 
who are living with both biological parents.18 The concept 
of family functioning and crime and the factors that dis-
turb this interaction are discussed in The Criminological 
Enterprise.
Family Deviance A number of studies have found that 
parental deviance has a powerful infl uence on children’s fu-
ture behavior. Kids look up to and are infl uenced by their 
parents, so it comes as no surprise that they are willing to 
model their behavior along parental lines.19 When parents 
drink, take drugs, and commit crimes, the effects can be 
both devastating and long term. In fact, research shows the 
effect is intergenerational: the children of deviant parents 
produce delinquent children themselves.20
Some of the most important data on the infl uence of 
parental deviance were gathered by British criminologist 
David Farrington, whose longitudinal research data were 
gathered in the long-term Cambridge Study in Delinquent 
Development (CSDD). Some of the most important results 
include:
A signifi cant number of delinquent youths have crimi-
 
■
nal fathers. About 8 percent of the sons of noncriminal 
fathers became chronic offenders, compared to 37 per-
cent of youths with criminal fathers.21

and self-injurious behaviors.34 The effects of family dys-
function are felt well beyond childhood. Kids who experi-
ence high levels of family confl ict grow up to lead stressful 
adult lives, punctuated by periods of depression.35 Children 
whose parents are harsh, angry, and irritable are likely to 
behave in the same way toward their own children, putting 
their own offspring at risk.36 Thus the seeds of adult dys-
function are planted early in childhood.
The Chicken or the Egg? Which comes fi rst, bad par-
ents or bad kids? Does poor parenting cause delinquency 
or do delinquents undermine their parents’ supervisory 
abilities? In a recent survey, David Huh and his colleagues 
questioned 500 adolescent girls from eight different schools 
to determine their perceived parental support and control 
and whether they engage in problem behaviors such as ly-
ing, stealing, running away, or substance abuse. Huh and 
his colleagues found little evidence that poor parenting is 
a direct cause of children’s misbehavior problems or that 
it escalates misbehavior. Rather, their results suggest that 
children’s problem behaviors undermine parenting effec-
tiveness. Increases in adolescent behavior problems, such 
as substance abuse, result in a decrease in parental control 
School yard bullying may be both inter- and intragen-
 
■
erational. Bullies have children who bully others, and 
these “second-generation bullies” grow up to become 
the parents of children who are also bullies (see Chap-
ter 9 for more on bullying in the school yard).22 Thus, 
one family may have a grandfather, father, and son who 
are or were school yard bullies.23
Kids whose parents go to prison are much more likely 
 
■
to be at risk for delinquency than children of nonincar-
cerated parents.24
Parental Efficacy While poor parenting and parental de-
viance may increase exposure to criminality, children raised 
by parents who have excellent parenting skills, who are sup-
portive and can effectively control their children in a non-
coercive fashion, are more insulated from crime-producing 
forces in society.25 Effective parenting can help neutralize 
the effect of both individual (e.g., emotional problems) and 
social (e.g., delinquent peers) forces that promote delin-
quent behaviors.26 Even kids who are at risk to delinquency 
because of personality problems or neurological syndromes, 
such as ADHD, have a much better prognosis if they receive 
effective, supportive parenting.27
Research shows that antisocial behavior will be reduced 
if parents provide the type of structure that integrates chil-
dren into families, while giving them the ability to assert 
their individuality and regulate their own behavior—a phe-
nomenon referred to as parental effi cacy.28 In some cul-
tures, emotional support from the mother is critical, whereas 
in others the father’s support remains the key factor.29
Numerous studies have uncovered links between the 
quality of family life and delinquency. Children who feel in-
hibited with their parents and refuse to discuss important 
issues with them are more likely to engage in deviant activi-
ties. Kids who report having troubled home lives also exhibit 
lower levels of self-esteem and are more prone to antisocial 
behaviors.30 One reason for poor communication is parents 
who rely on authoritarian disciplinary practices, holding a 
“my way or the highway” orientation. Telling kids that “as 
long as you live in my house you will obey my rules” does 
little to improve communications and may instead produce 
kids who are rebellious and crime prone.31
While the prevailing wisdom is that bad parents produce 
bad kids, some recent research by David Huh and his col-
leagues found that the relationship may not be what it seems. 
Child Maltreatment There is also a suspected link be-
tween crime and child abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse.32
Numerous studies conducted in the United States and 
abroad show that there is a signifi cant association between 
child maltreatment and serious self-reported and offi cial de-
linquency, even when taking into account gender, race, and 
class.33 Children, both males and females, black or white, 
who experience abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse are believed 
to be more crime prone and suffer from other social prob-
lems such as depression, suicide attempts, substance abuse,

Children raised by parents who have excellent parenting skills, who 
are supportive, and who can effectively control their children in a 
noncoercive fashion are more insulated from crime-producing forces 
in society. Effective parenting can help neutralize the effect of both 
individual and social forces that promote delinquent behaviors. Parental 
efficacy means that parents provide the type of structure that integrates 
children into families, while giving them the ability to assert their 
individuality and regulate their own behavior. Bringing children to the 
library and encouraging them to read is but one method of effective 
parenting that can neutralize crime-promoting forces in society.

out is not directly related to crime, it reduces earnings and 
dampens future life achievements.
Peer Relations
Psychologists have long recognized that the peer group has a 
powerful effect on human conduct and can have a dramatic 
infl uence on decision making and behavior choices.44 Peer 
infl uence on delinquent and criminal behavior has been re-
corded in different cultures and may be a universal norm.45
Peer relations can be a double-edged sword. Popular 
kids who hang out with their friends without parental su-
pervision are at risk for delinquent behaviors mainly be-
cause they have more opportunity to get into trouble.46 
Less-popular kids, who are routinely rejected by their peers, 
are more likely to display aggressive behavior and to disrupt 
group activities through bickering, bullying, or other anti-
social behavior.47 Those who report inadequate or strained 
peer relations, and who say they are not popular with the 
opposite sex, are prone to delinquent behaviors.48
Though experts have long debated the exact relation-
ship between peer group interaction and delinquency, there 
is little question that some kids are particularly susceptible 
to peer infl uence.49 The more antisocial the peer group, the 
more likely its members will engage in delinquency; non-
delinquent friends will help moderate delinquency.50 One 
recent study found that kids involved in delinquency are 
fi ve times more likely than nonoffenders to associate with 
delinquent peers.51
While there is agreement that the association between 
peers and criminality exists, there is some debate over the 
path of the relationship:
Delinquent friends cause law-abiding youth to get 
 
■
in trouble. Kids who fall in with a bad crowd are at 
risk for delinquency.52 For girls, a “bad crowd” usu-
ally means teenage boys! It may not be surprising that 
delinquent girls are signifi cantly more likely than their 
nondelinquent peers to identify males as their closest 
friends.53 For girls, hanging out with males may be a 
precursor to antisocial behavior.54
Antisocial youths seek out and join up with like-
 
■
minded friends; deviant peers sustain and amplify 
delinquent careers.55 Those who choose aggressive or 
violent friends are more likely to begin engaging in 
antisocial behavior themselves and suffer psychological 
defi cits.56 A number of research efforts have found that 
boys who go through puberty at an early age are more 
likely to later engage in violence, property crimes, drug 
use, and precocious sexual behavior.57 The boys who 
mature early are the most likely to develop strong at-
tachments to delinquent friends and to be infl uenced 
by peer pressure.58
As children move through their life course, antisocial 
 
■
friends help youths maintain delinquent careers and 
and support. Parental control actually played a small role in 
infl uencing children’s behavior problems.
Huh suggests it is possible that the parents of adolescents 
who consistently misbehave may become more tolerant of 
their behavior and give up on attempts at control. As their 
kids’ behaviors become increasingly threatening and unruly, 
parents may simply detach from and reject their kids. So in 
the fi nal analysis, the egg may control the chicken and not 
vice versa.37
Educational Experience
The educational process and adolescent achievement in 
school have been linked to criminality. Studies show that 
children who do poorly in school, lack educational moti-
vation, and feel alienated are the most likely to engage in 
criminal acts.38 Children who fail in school have been found 
to offend more frequently than those who are successful in 
school. These children commit more serious and violent of-
fenses and persist in their offending into adulthood.39
Schools contribute to criminality when they label prob-
lem youths and set them apart from conventional society. 
One way in which schools perpetuate this stigmatization is 
the “track system,” which identifi es some students as col-
lege bound and others as academic underachievers or po-
tential dropouts.40 Those children placed in tracks labeled 
advanced placement, college prep, or honors will develop 
positive self-images and achievement motivation, whereas 
those assigned to lower level or general courses of study 
may believe academic achievement is closed to someone of 
their limited skills.
Dropping Out Another signifi cant educational problem 
is that many students leave high school without gaining a 
diploma. Each year, approximately 1.2 million students fail 
to graduate from high school, more than half of whom are 
from minority groups. Nationally, about 71 percent of all 
students graduate from high school, but there are signifi -
cant differences across racial groups. About half of African 
American and Hispanic students earn diplomas with their 
peers; in many states, there is a gap of as many as 40 or 50 
percentage points between white and black students. There 
are also economic differences: a 16- to 24-year-old coming 
from the highest quartile of family income is about seven 
times as likely to have completed high school as a 16- to 
24-year-old coming from the lowest quartile.41
The research on the effect of dropping out is a mixed 
bag. Some research fi ndings indicate that school dropouts 
face a signifi cant chance of entering a criminal career, but 
other efforts using sophisticated methodological tools have 
failed to fi nd a dropout effect.42 If there is a “dropout effect,” 
it is because those who leave school early already have a 
long history of poor school performance and antisocial be-
haviors.43 In other words, poor school performance predicts 
both dropping out and antisocial activity. Even if dropping

enhances the effect of parental affection in two-parent homes 
and also helps kids living in single-parent homes resist the 
infl uence of deviant peers. Petts found that religious partici-
pation helps reduce deviant behavior involvement through-
out the life course, from adolescence until marriage.69
Socialization and Crime
To many criminologists, social process, social interaction, 
and socialization are the chief determinants of criminal be-
havior. While a person’s place in the social structure may 
contribute to crime, environment alone is not enough to ex-
plain criminality. People living in even the most deteriorated 
urban areas can successfully resist inducements to crime if 
they have a positive self-image, learn moral values, and have 
the support of their parents, peers, teachers, and neighbors. 
The girl with a positive self-image who is chosen for a college 
scholarship has the warm, loving support of her parents and 
is viewed by friends and neighbors as someone who is “going 
places.” She is less likely to adopt a criminal way of life than 
another adolescent who is abused at home, lives with crimi-
nal parents, and whose bond to her school and peer group 
is shattered because she is labeled a troublemaker.70 The 
boy who has learned criminal behavior from his parents and 
siblings and then joins a neighborhood gang is much more 
likely to become an adult criminal than his next-door neigh-
bor who idolizes his hard-working, deeply religious parents. 
obstruct the aging-out process.59 In contrast, noncrimi-
nal friends moderate criminality.60 When (and if) adult-
hood brings close and sustaining ties to conventional 
friends, marriage, and family, levels of deviant behavior 
decline.61 Troubled kids choose delinquent peers out 
of necessity rather than desire. The social baggage they 
cart around prevents them from developing associations 
with conventional peers. Because they are impulsive, 
they may join cliques whose members are danger-
ous and get them into trouble.62 The most at-risk kids 
may choose older peers, perhaps because they believe 
these older, tougher friends can provide some level of 
protection; their choices may backfi re when their more 
mature companions enmesh them in a deviant subcul-
ture.63 Older peers do not cause straight kids to go bad, 
but they amplify the likelihood of a troubled kid getting 
further involved in antisocial behaviors.64 The fear of 
punishment is diminished among kids who hang with 
delinquent friends, and loyalty to delinquent peers may 
outweigh the fear of punishment.65
Religion and Belief
Logic would dictate that people who hold high moral val-
ues and beliefs, who have learned to distinguish right from 
wrong, and who regularly attend religious services should 
also eschew crime and other antisocial behaviors.66 Religion 
binds people together and forces them to 
confront the consequences of their be-
havior. Committing crimes would violate 
the principles of all organized religions.
More than 40 years ago in a now 
classic study, Travis Hirschi and Rodney 
Stark found that, contrary to expecta-
tions, the association between religious 
attendance and belief and delinquent 
behavior patterns is negligible and insig-
nifi cant.67 Since the publication of their 
milestone study, there have been numer-
ous research efforts to review the infl u-
ence of religion on misbehavior, and a 
majority have reached an opposite con-
clusion: maintaining religious beliefs and 
attending religious services signifi cantly 
helps reduce crime.68 Recently, Rich-
ard Petts used data from a national sur-
vey and found that adolescents residing 
within two-parent families are less likely 
to become delinquent and that support-
ive parenting practices reduce the likeli-
hood of their becoming delinquent even 
further. However, whether they reside 
in single-parent or two-parent families, 
kids who are involved in religion are less 
likely to engage in delinquency. Religion

Many kids have religious affiliations or belong to other institutions that teach moral values 
that may help shield them from delinquency. Here, Natalie Kruger (15) gives a high-five to 
youth leader Adrian Martin at a food distribution center in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as other 
teenagers from Eastminster Presbyterian Church gather around them after the group 
finished stocking items they brought from their church. The teens joined their peers 
nationwide for “World Vision,” a 30-hour fast during which they also donated food and 
necessities to organizations that distribute them to the needy.

ers. Each of these independent branches will be discussed

SOCIAL LEARNING THEORY
Social learning theorists believe crime is a product of learn-
ing the norms, values, and behaviors associated with crimi-
nal activity. Social learning can involve the actual techniques 
of crime—how to hot-wire a car or roll a joint—as well as 
the psychological aspects of criminality—how to deal with 
It is socialization, not the social structure, that determines life 
chances. The more social problems encountered during the 
socialization process, the greater the likelihood that youths 
will encounter diffi culties and obstacles as they mature, such 
as being unemployed or becoming a teenage mother.
Theorists who believe that an individual’s socialization 
determines the likelihood of criminality adopt the social 
process approach to human behavior. The social process ap-
proach has several independent branches (Figure 7.1):
Social learning theory
 
■
 suggests that people learn 
the techniques and attitudes of crime from close and 
intimate relationships with criminal peers; crime is a 
learned behavior.
Social control theory
 
■
 maintains that everyone has the 
potential to become a criminal, but that most people are 
controlled by their bonds to society. Crime occurs when 
the forces that bind people to society are weakened or 
broken.
Social reaction theory (labeling theory
 
■
) says people 
become criminals when signifi cant members of society 
label them as such, and they accept those labels as a 
personal identity.

are born good and learn to be bad; social control theory

occasions when violent motion pictures seem to provoke 
mass criminal episodes, these outbreaks can be more 
readily explained as a reaction to peer group pressure 
than as a reaction to the fi lms themselves.
Criminal techniques are learned. 
 
■
Learning criminal be-
havior involves acquiring the techniques of commit-
ting the crime, which are sometimes very complicated 
and sometimes very simple. This requires learning the 
specifi c direction of motives, drives, rationalizations, 
and attitudes. Some kids may meet and associate with 
criminal “mentors” who teach them how to be success-
ful criminals and gain the greatest benefi ts from their 
criminal activities.75 They learn the proper way to pick 
a lock, shoplift, and obtain and use narcotics. In addi-
tion, novice criminals learn to use the proper terminol-
ogy for their acts and then acquire “proper” reactions to 
law violations. For example, getting high on marijuana 
and learning the proper way to smoke a joint are be-
havior patterns usually acquired from more experienced 
companions. Moreover, criminals must learn how to re-
act properly to their illegal acts, such as when to defend 
them, rationalize them, or show remorse for them.
Perceptions of the legal code infl uence motives and drives. 
 
■
The specifi c direction of motives and drives is learned 
from perceptions of various aspects of the legal code as 
being favorable or unfavorable. The reaction to social 
rules and laws is not uniform across society, and people 
constantly come into contact with others who maintain 
different views on the utility of obeying the legal code. 
Some people they admire may openly disdain or fl out 
the law or ignore its substance. People experience what 
Sutherland calls culture confl ict when they are exposed 
to different and opposing attitudes toward what is right 
and wrong, moral and immoral. The confl ict of social 
attitudes and cultural norms is the basis for the concept 
of differential association.
Differential associations may vary in frequency, duration, 
 
■
priority, and intensity. Whether a person learns to obey 
the law or to disregard it is infl uenced by the quality 
of social interactions. Those of lasting duration have 
greater infl uence than those that are brief. Similarly, fre-
quent contacts have greater effect than rare and haphaz-
ard contacts. Sutherland did not specify what he meant 
by priority, but Cressey and others have interpreted the 
term to mean the age of children when they fi rst en-
counter defi nitions of criminality. Contacts made early 
in life probably have a greater and more far-reaching 
infl uence than those developed later on. Finally, inten-
sity is generally interpreted to mean the importance 
and prestige attributed to the individual or groups from 
whom the defi nitions are learned. For example, the 
infl uence of a father, mother, or trusted friend far out-
weighs the effect of more socially distant fi gures.
The process of learning criminal behavior by association 
 
■
with criminal and anticriminal patterns involves all of the 
mechanisms involved in any other learning process. This 
the guilt or shame associated with illegal activities. This sec-
tion briefl y reviews the three most prominent forms of social 
learning theory: differential association theory, differential 
reinforcement theory, and neutralization theory.
Differential Association Theory
One of the most prominent social learning theories is Ed-
win H. Sutherland’s differential association theory. Often 
considered the preeminent U.S. criminologist, Sutherland 
fi rst put forth his theory in his 1939 text, Principles of Crimi-
nology.71 The fi nal version of the theory appeared in 1947. 
When Sutherland died in 1950, Donald Cressey, his long-
time associate, continued his work. Cressey was so success-
ful in explaining and popularizing his mentor’s efforts that 
differential association remains one of the most enduring 
explanations of criminal behavior.
Sutherland’s research on white-collar crime, profes-
sional theft, and intelligence led him to dispute the notion 
that crime was a function of the inadequacy of people in the 
lower classes.72 To Sutherland, criminality stemmed neither 
from individual traits nor from socioeconomic position; in-
stead, he believed it to be a function of a learning process 
that could affect any individual in any culture. Acquiring a 
behavior is a social learning process, not a political or legal 
process. Skills and motives conducive to crime are learned 
as a result of contacts with procrime values, attitudes, and 
defi nitions and other patterns of criminal behavior.
Principles of Differential Association The basic prin-
ciples of differential association are explained as follows:73
Criminal behavior is learned. 
 
■
This statement differentiates 
Sutherland’s theory from prior attempts to classify crim-
inal behavior as an inherent characteristic of criminals. 
By suggesting that delinquent and criminal behavior is 
learned, Sutherland implied that it can be classifi ed in 
the same manner as any other learned behavior, such as 
writing, painting, or reading.
Learning is a by-product of interaction. 
 
■
Criminal behavior 
is learned as a by-product of interacting with others. 
Sutherland believed individuals do not start violating 
the law simply by living in a criminogenic environ-
ment or by manifesting personal characteristics, such as 
low IQ or family problems, associated with criminality. 
People—family, friends, peers—have the greatest infl u-
ence on their deviant behavior and attitude develop-
ment. Relationships with these infl uential individuals 
color and control the way people interpret everyday 
events. For example, research shows that children who 
grow up in homes where parents abuse alcohol are more 
likely to view drinking as being socially and physically 
benefi cial.74 The intimacy of these associations far out-
weighs the importance of any other form of communica-
tion, such as movies or television. Even on those rare

238  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
definitions favorable toward criminality and are isolated 
from counteracting forces. A definition favorable toward 
criminality occurs, for example, when a person is exposed 
to friends sneaking into a theater to avoid paying for a ticket 
or talking about the virtues of getting high on drugs. A defi -
nition unfavorable toward crime occurs when friends or 
parents demonstrate their disapproval of crime. Neutral be-
havior, such as reading a book, is neither positive nor nega-
tive with respect to law violation. Cressey argues that neutral 
behavior is important; for example, when a child is occupied 
doing something neutral, it prevents him or her from being 
in contact with those involved in criminal behaviors.76
In sum, differential association theory holds that people 
learn criminal attitudes and behavior while in their adoles-
cence from close and trusted friends and/or relatives. A crim-
inal career develops if learned antisocial values and behaviors 
are not at least matched or exceeded by conventional atti-
tudes and behaviors. Criminal behavior, then, is learned in a 
process that is similar to learning any other human behavior.
Testing Differential Association Theory Numerous re-
search efforts have supported the core principles of differen-
tial association. These generally show a correlation between 
suggests that learning criminal behavior patterns is 
similar to learning nearly all other patterns and is not a 
matter of mere imitation.
Criminal behavior is an expression of general needs and 
 
■
values, but it is not excused by those general needs and 
values because noncriminal behavior is also an expression 
of those same needs and values. This principle suggests 
that the motives for criminal behavior cannot logically 
be the same as those for conventional behavior. Suther-
land rules out such motives as desire to accumulate 
money or social status, personal frustration, or low 
self-concept as causes of crime because they are just as 
likely to produce noncriminal behavior, such as getting 
a better education or working harder on a job. It is only 
the learning of deviant norms through contact with an 
excess of defi nitions favorable toward criminality that 
produces illegal behavior.
A person becomes a criminal when he or she perceives 
more favorable than unfavorable consequences to violat-
ing the law (Figure 7.2). According to Sutherland’s theory, 
individuals become law violators when they are in contact 
with people, groups, or events that produce an excess of

CHAPTER 7 | Social Process Theories: Socialization and Society  239
I had a friend of mine who was an older guy, and he 
 introduced me to selling marijuana to make a few dol-
lars. I started selling a little and made a few dollars. For 
a young guy to be making a hundred dollars or so, it 
was a lot of money. So I got kind of tied up in that as-
pect of selling drugs.91
Tunnell found that making connections is an important 
part of the dealer’s world. Adolescent drug users are likely to 
have intimate relationships with a peer friendship network 
that supports their substance abuse and teaches them how 
to deal within the drug world.92
Differential association may also be used to explain the 
gender difference in the crime rate. Males are more likely to 
socialize with deviant peers than females and, when they do, 
are more deeply infl uenced by peer relations.93 Females are 
shielded by their unique moral sense, which makes caring 
about people and avoiding social harm a top priority. Males, 
in contrast, have a more cavalier attitude toward others and 
are more interested in their own self-interests. They are there-
fore more susceptible to the infl uence of deviant peers.94
Analysis of Differential Association Theory There have 
been a number of important critiques of the theory. Ac-
cording to the cultural deviance critique, differential associa-
tion is invalid because it suggests that criminals are people 
“properly” socialized into a deviant subculture; that is, they 
are taught criminal norms by signifi cant others. Supporters 
counter that differential association also recognizes that in-
dividuals can embrace criminality because they have been 
improperly socialized into the normative culture.95
Differential association theory also fails to explain why 
one youth who is exposed to delinquent defi nitions eventu-
ally succumbs to them, while another, living under the same 
conditions, is able to avoid criminal entanglements. It also 
fails to account for the origin of delinquent defi nitions: How 
did the fi rst “teacher” learn delinquent attitudes and defi ni-
tions in order to pass them on? Who taught the teacher?
Differential association theory assumes that youths learn 
about crime and then commit criminal acts, but it is also 
possible that experienced delinquents and criminals seek 
out like-minded peers after they engage in antisocial acts 
and that the internalization of deviant attitudes follows, 
rather than precedes, criminality (“birds of a feather fl ock 
together”).96 Research on gang boys shows that they are in-
volved in high rates of criminality before they join gangs, in-
dicating that the group experience facilitates their antisocial 
behavior rather than playing a role in its creation.97
Despite these criticisms, differential association theory 
maintains an important place in the study of criminal be-
havior. For one thing, it provides a consistent explanation 
of all types of delinquent and criminal behavior. Unlike so-
cial structure theories, it is not limited to the explanation of 
a single facet of antisocial activity, such as lower-class gang 
activity. The theory can also account for the extensive de-
linquent behavior found even in middle- and upper-class 
(a) having deviant parents and friends, (b) holding deviant 
attitudes, and (c) committing deviant acts.77 A recent meta-
analysis of the literature by Travis Pratt and his associates 
found that the association between crime and measures of 
differential association are “quite strong.”78 Among the most 
important fi ndings are:
Crime appears to be intergenerational. Kids whose par-
 
■
ents are deviant and criminal are more likely to become 
criminals themselves and eventually to produce crimi-
nal children.
The more deviant an adolescent’s social network and 
 
■
network of affi liations, including parents, peers, and 
romantic partners, the more likely that adolescent is to 
engage in antisocial behavior.79 This fi nding supports 
the hypothesis that children learn criminal attitudes 
from exposure to deviant others, rather than crime be-
ing a function of inherited criminal traits.80
People who report having attitudes that support devi-
 
■
ant behavior are also likely to engage in deviant behav-
ior.81 As people mature, having delinquent friends who 
support criminal attitudes and behavior is strongly 
related to developing criminal careers. Association with 
deviant peers has been found to sustain the deviant 
attitudes.82
The infl uence of deviant friends is highly supportive 
 
■
of delinquency, regardless of race and/or class.83 One 
reason is that within peer groups, high-status leaders 
will infl uence and legitimize deviant behavior. In other 
words, if one of your friends whom you look up to 
drinks and smokes, it makes it a lot easier for you to 
engage in those behaviors yourself and to believe they 
are appropriate.84
Romantic partners who engage in antisocial activities 
 
■
may infl uence their partner’s behavior, which suggests 
that partners learn from one another.85 Adolescents 
with deviant romantic partners are more delinquent 
than those youths with more prosocial partners, regard-
less of friends’ and parents’ behavior.86
Kids who associate and presumably learn from aggres-
 
■
sive peers are more likely to behave aggressively them-
selves.87 Deviant peers interfere with the natural process 
of aging out of crime by helping provide the support 
that keeps kids in criminal careers.88
Differential association is multicultural. Scales measur-
 
■
ing differential association have been signifi cantly cor-
related with criminal behaviors among samples taken in 
other nations and cultures.89
Differential association also seems especially relevant in 
trying to explain the onset of substance abuse and a career 
in the drug trade. This requires learning proper techniques 
and attitudes from an experienced user or dealer.90 In his 
interview study of low-level drug dealers, Kenneth Tunnell 
found that many novices were tutored by a more experi-
enced criminal dealer who helped them make connections 
with buyers and sellers. One told him:

their behavior as good or at least as justifi ed, rather than as 
undesirable, the more likely they are to engage in it. Adoles-
cents who join a drug-abusing peer group whose members 
value drugs and alcohol, encourage their use, and provide 
opportunities to observe people abusing substances will be 
encouraged, through this social learning experience, to use 
drugs themselves.
Akers’s theory posits that the principal infl uence on 
behavior comes from “those groups that control individu-
als’ major sources of reinforcement and punishment and 
expose them to behavioral models and normative defi ni-
tions.”100 The important groups are the ones with which 
a person is in differential association—peer and friend-
ship groups, schools, churches, and similar institutions. 
Within the context of these critical groups, according to 
Akers, “deviant behavior can be expected to the extent 
that it has been differentially reinforced over alternative 
behavior . . . and is defi ned as desirable or justifi ed.”101
Once people are indoctrinated into crime, their behavior 
can be reinforced by being exposed to deviant behavior 
models—associating with deviant peers—without be-
ing subject to negative reinforcements for their antisocial 
acts. The deviant behavior, originally executed by imitat-
ing someone else’s behavior, is sustained by social sup-
port. For example, kids who engage in computer crime 
and computer hacking may fi nd their behavior reinforced 
by peers who are playing the same game.102
It is possible that differential reinforcements help estab-
lish criminal careers and are a key factor in explaining per-
sistent criminality.
Testing Differential Reinforcement The principles of 
differential reinforcement have been subject to empirical re-
view by Akers and other criminologists.103 In an important 
test of his theory, Akers and his associates surveyed 3,065 
male and female adolescents on drug- and alcohol-related 
activities and their perception of variables related to social 
learning and differential reinforcement. Items in the scale in-
cluded the respondents’ perceptions of esteemed peers’ atti-
tudes toward drug and alcohol abuse, the number of people 
they admired who actually used controlled substances, and 
whether people they admired would reward or punish them 
for substance abuse. Akers found a strong association be-
tween drug and alcohol abuse and social learning variables: 
those who believed they would be rewarded for deviance 
by those they respect were the ones most likely to engage 
in deviant behavior.104 Aker’s efforts have been supported 
by research showing that kids whose deviant behavior (such 
as smoking pot) is reinforced by signifi cant others (such as 
parents or peers) are more likely to accelerate their rates of 
deviance.105
Akers also found that the learning–deviant behavior 
link is not static. The learning experience continues within 
a deviant group as behavior is both infl uenced by and ex-
erts infl uence over group processes. For example, adoles-
cents may learn to smoke because their friends are smoking 
areas, where youths may be exposed to a variety of prodelin-
quent defi nitions from such sources as overly opportunistic 
parents and friends. The theory appears fl exible and able to 
explain current trends in crime and is not bound by those 
that existed when the theory was fi rst created. For example, 
Sameer Hinduja and Jason Ingram found that adolescents 
who pirate music off the Internet are influenced by both 
personal friends and also online friends they meet in chat 
rooms and so on. Internet music piracy is not a crime that 
Sutherland had in mind when he fi rst proposed the theory 
more than 70 years ago.98
Differential Reinforcement Theory
Differential reinforcement theory is another attempt to 
explain crime as a type of learned behavior. First proposed 
by Ronald Akers in collaboration with Robert Burgess in 
1966, it is a version of the social learning view that employs 
both differential association concepts along with elements of 
psychological learning theory.
Psychological learning theories were fi rst discussed in 
Chapter 5. These trait theories maintain that human 
actions are developed through learning experiences. 
Behavior is supported by rewards and extinguished by 
negative reactions or punishments. In contrast, socio-
logical learning theory holds that behavior is constantly 
being shaped by life experiences.
CONNECTIONS
According to Akers, the same process is involved in 
learning both deviant and conventional behavior. People 
learn to be neither “all deviant” nor “all conforming,” but 
rather strike a balance between the two opposing poles of 
behavior. This balance is usually stable, but it can undergo 
revision over time.99
A number of learning processes shape behavior. Direct 
conditioning, also called differential reinforcement, oc-
curs when behavior is reinforced by being either rewarded 
or punished while interacting with others. When behavior 
is punished, this is referred to as negative reinforcement. 
This type of reinforcement can be distributed either by us-
ing negative stimuli (punishment) or by loss of a positive 
reward. Whether deviant or criminal behavior has been ini-
tiated or persists depends on the degree to which it has been 
rewarded or punished and the rewards or punishments at-
tached to its alternatives.
According to Akers, people learn to evaluate their own 
behavior through their interactions with significant oth-
ers and groups in their lives. These groups control sources 
and patterns of reinforcement, defi ne behavior as right or 
wrong, and provide behaviors that can be modeled through 
observational learning. The more individuals learn to defi ne

considering the outcome of their past experiences, potential 
offenders decide which criminal acts will be profi table and 
which are dangerous and should be avoided.108 Integrat-
ing these perspectives, people make rational choices about 
crime because they have learned to balance risks against the 
potential for criminal gain.
Neutralization Theory
Neutralization theory is identifi ed with the writings of Da-
vid Matza and his associate Gresham Sykes.109 They view 
the process of becoming a criminal as a learning experi-
ence in which potential delinquents and criminals master 
techniques that enable them to counterbalance or neutral-
ize conventional values and drift back and forth between 
illegitimate and conventional behavior. One reason this is 
possible is the subterranean value structure of American 
society. Subterranean values are morally tinged infl uences 
that have become entrenched in the culture but are pub-
licly condemned. They exist side by side with conventional 
values and while condemned in public may be admired 
or practiced in private. Examples include viewing porno-
graphic fi lms, drinking alcohol to excess, and gambling on 
sporting events. In American culture, it is common to hold 
both subterranean and conventional values; few people are 
“all good” or “all bad.”
Matza argues that even the most committed criminals 
and delinquents are not involved in criminality all the time; 
they also attend schools, family functions, and religious 
services. Their behavior can be conceived as falling along a 
continuum between total freedom and total restraint. This 
process, which he calls drift, refers to the movement from 
one extreme of behavior to another, resulting in behavior 
that is sometimes unconventional, free, or deviant and at 
other times constrained and sober.110 Learning techniques 
of neutralization enables a person to temporarily “drift 
away” from conventional behavior and get involved in more 
subterranean values and behaviors, including crime and 
drug abuse.111
Sykes and Matza base their theoretical model on these 
observations:112
Criminals sometimes voice a sense of guilt over their illegal 
 
■
acts. If a stable criminal value system existed in opposi-
tion to generally held values and rules, it would be un-
likely that criminals would exhibit any remorse for their 
acts, other than regret at being apprehended.
Offenders frequently respect and admire honest, law-abiding 
 
■
people. Really honest people are often revered, and if for 
some reason such people are accused of misbehavior, 
the criminal is quick to defend their integrity. Those 
admired may include sports fi gures, priests and other 
clergy, parents, teachers, and neighbors.
Criminals draw a line between those whom they can vic-
 
■
timize and those whom they cannot. Members of similar 
and, therefore, approve of this behavior. Over time, smok-
ing influences friendships and peer group memberships 
as smokers seek out one another for companionship and 
support.106
Differential reinforcement theory is an important per-
spective that endeavors to determine the cause of criminal 
activity. It considers how the content of socialization condi-
tions crime. Because not all socialization is positive, it ac-
counts for the fact that negative social reinforcements and 
experiences can produce criminal results. This concurs with 
research that demonstrates that parental deviance is related 
to adolescent antisocial behavior.107 Parents may reinforce 
their children’s deviant behavior by supplying negative so-
cial reinforcements. Akers’s work also fi ts well with rational 
choice theory because they both suggest that people learn 
the techniques and attitudes necessary to commit crime. 
Criminal knowledge is gained through experience. After

Differential association theory suggests that people learn the 
techniques and attitudes necessary to commit crime. Criminal 
knowledge is gained through experience, and after considering the 
outcomes of their past experiences, potential offenders decide which 
criminal acts will be profitable and which are dangerous and should be 
avoided. Here, a young man is shown photographing a drug deal on 
his cell phone. Is it possible that he is documenting the experience to 
learn and keep a record of the best techniques of drug dealing?

242  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Deny injury. 
 
■
By denying the wrongfulness of an act, 
criminals are able to neutralize illegal behavior. For 
example, stealing is viewed as borrowing; vandalism is 
considered mischief that has gotten out of hand. Delin-
quents may fi nd that their parents and friends support 
their denial of injury. In fact, they may claim that the 
behavior was merely a prank, helping affi rm the offend-
er’s perception that crime can be socially acceptable. 
Since no one was “really hurt” the act was not “really a 
crime.” The Profi les in Crime feature illustrates this ele-
ment of neutralization. 
Deny the victim. 
 
■
Criminals sometimes neutralize wrong-
doing by maintaining that the victim of crime “had it 
coming.” Vandalism may be directed against a disliked 
teacher or neighbor; homosexuals may be beaten up by 
a gang because their behavior is considered offensive. 
Denying the victim may also take the form of ignoring 
the rights of an absent or unknown victim—for ex-
ample, stealing from the unseen owner of a department 
store. It becomes morally acceptable for the criminal 
to commit such crimes as vandalism when the victims, 
because of their absence, cannot be sympathized with 
or respected.
Condemn condemners. 
 
■
An offender views the world as a 
corrupt place with a dog-eat-dog code. Because police 
and judges are on the take, teachers show 
favoritism, and parents take out their 
frustrations on their kids, it is ironic and 
unfair for these authorities to condemn 
his or her misconduct. By shifting the 
blame to others, criminals are able to 
repress the feeling that their own acts are 
wrong.
■  Appeal to higher loyalties. Novice crimi-
nals often argue that they are caught 
in the dilemma of being loyal to their 
own peer group while at the same time 
attempting to abide by the rules of the 
larger society. The needs of the group 
take precedence over the rules of soci-
ety because the demands of the former 
are immediate and localized.
In sum, the theory of neutraliza-
tion presupposes a condition that al-
lows people to neutralize unconventional 
norms and values by using such slogans 
as “I didn’t mean to do it,” “I didn’t really 
hurt anybody,” “They had it coming to 
them,” “Everybody’s picking on me,” and 
“I didn’t do it for myself.” These excuses 
allow people to drift into criminal modes 
of behavior.
Testing Neutralization Theory At-
tempts have been made to verify the 
assumptions of neutralization theory 
ethnic groups, churches, or neighborhoods are often off 
limits. This practice implies that criminals are aware of 
the wrongfulness of their acts.
Criminals are not immune to the demands of conformity.
 
■
 
Most criminals frequently participate in many of the 
same social functions as law-abiding people—for ex-
ample, in school, church, and family activities.
Because of these factors, Sykes and Matza conclude that 
criminality is the result of the neutralization of accepted so-
cial values through the learning of a standard set of tech-
niques that allow people to counteract the moral dilemmas 
posed by illegal behavior.113
Techniques of Neutralization Sykes and Matza suggest 
that people develop a distinct set of justifi cations for their 
law-violating behavior (Figure 7.3). These neutralization 
techniques enable them to temporarily drift away from the 
rules of the normative society and participate in subterra-
nean behaviors. These techniques of neutralization include 
the following patterns:
Deny responsibility. 
 
■
Young offenders sometimes claim 
their unlawful acts were simply not their fault. Criminal 
acts resulted from forces beyond their control or were 
accidents.

market bogus flu shots and other health 
care services to doctors, churches, pharma-
cies, retirement communities, and others in 
Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, and Colorado.
El Hawa and Gonzales then ordered sy-
ringes, vials of sterilized water to serve as 
the fake vaccine, and other medical sup-
plies from legitimate medical suppliers. To 
cover their tracks and make the vaccine 
appear—at least on paper—to be legiti-
mate, they forged invoices and other docu-
ments. Since they used sterilized water, 
they assumed no one would really get hurt; 
their plan soon went awry.
The nurses hired by the pair unknow-
ingly administered thousands of fake shots. 
El Hawa and Gonzales also provided sy-
ringes prefilled with the fake vaccine to at 
least one doctor’s office. That put the health 
of some unsuspecting victims at risk, since 
the pair frequently didn’t bother to use 
proper hygienic methods to fill the syringes. 
After the shots were given, El Hawa and 
Gonzales created fake medical records, 
submitted fraudulent claims to Medicare, 
Medicaid, and various insurance compa-
nies, and then sat back and waited for the 
insurance reimbursement checks to start 
rolling in.
How were they caught? One of the 
nurses got suspicious and called the FBI 
after discovering that there were no vials of 
vaccine and that the couple could not pro-
vide the manufacturer tracking numbers for 
the vaccine. As federal agents closed in, 
they caught El Hawa trying to discard left-
over syringes in a dumpster near his office. 
He and Gonzales were later convicted and 
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

But the Water Was Sterile!
Anticipating another tough flu season, 
some 1,100 employees at a Texas-based 
oil company lined up to get flu shots dur-
ing a company-sponsored health fair. 
Little did they—or their employer—know 
that after rolling up their sleeves, they’d 
be injected with water, not vaccine. And 
they weren’t the only ones to receive the 
fake shots—residents of retirement com-
munities and others in the Houston area 
got them too.
It was part of an elaborate scam orches-
trated over several months by Iyad Abu El 
Hawa and Martha Denise Gonzales, a pair 
of Houston-area criminals hoping to cash in 
on insurance money.
Here’s how El Hawa and Gonzales 
staged their ruse. First, they set up fake 
health care offices in three different lo-
cations, staffed them with unlicensed 
“medical practitioners,” and hired a few 
unsuspecting licensed nurses to make the 
offices look legitimate.
Next, Gonzales used her connections 
from a job as a doctor’s office manager to

empirically, but the results have been inconclusive.114 One 
area of research has been directed at determining whether 
there really is a need for law violators to neutralize moral 
constraints. The thinking behind this research is this: if 
criminals hold values in opposition to accepted social norms, 
then there is really no need to neutralize. So far, the evi-
dence is mixed. Some studies show that law violators ap-
prove of criminal behavior, such as theft and violence, and 
still others fi nd evidence that even though they may be ac-
tive participants themselves, criminals voice disapproval of 
illegal behavior.115 Some studies indicate that law violators 
approve of social values such as honesty and fairness; others 
come to the opposite conclusion.116
In addition to youthful delinquent behaviors, the adop-
tion of neutralization techniques has also been used to ex-
plain the onset of white-collar crime.117 Businessmen may 
fi nd it easier to cut corners by claiming that “the govern-
ment exaggerates dangers to the consumer” (denial of in-
jury) or the “markets are generally safe so the corporate 
producers should not have to take blame for the few in-
juries that occur” (denial of responsibility) or “the bottom 
line is all that matters” (appeal to higher loyalty). The need 
to get ahead in the corporate world may help them neutral-
ize the moral constraints that their parents may have taught 
them in adolescence, such as play fair, don’t cheat, take 
responsibility.
The theory of neutralization, then, is a major contribu-
tion to the literature of crime and delinquency. It can ac-
count for the aging-out process: youths can forgo criminal 
behavior as adults because they never really rejected the 
morality of normative society. It helps explain the behavior 
of the occasional or nonchronic delinquent, who is able to 
successfully age out of crime. Because teens are not commit-
ted to criminality, as they mature they simply drift back into 
conventional behavior patterns. While they are young, justi-
fi cations and excuses neutralize guilt and enable individuals 
to continue to feel good about themselves.118 In contrast, 
people who remain criminals as adults may be using newly 
learned techniques to neutralize the wrongfulness of their 
actions and avoid guilt. For example, psychotherapists ac-
cused of sexually exploiting their clients blame the victim 
for “seducing them”; some claim there was little injury 
caused by the sexual encounter; others seek scapegoats to 
blame for their actions.119

244  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Topalli refers to streetwise offenders 
such as Bacca as “hardcores,” who expe-
rience no guilt for their actions and oper-
ate with little or no regard for the law. They 
have little contact with agents of formal 
social control or conventional norms be-
cause their crimes are not directed toward 
conventional society—they rob drug deal-
ers. Most hardcores maintain no perma-
nent home, staying in various residences 
as their whim dictates. Their lifestyles are 
almost entirely dominated by the street eth-
ics of violence, self-sufficiency, and oppor-
tunism. Obsessed with a constant need for 
cash, drugs, and alcohol in order to “keep 
the party going,” on the one hand, and lim-
ited by self-defeating and reckless spend-
ing habits on the other, they often engage in 
violent crime to bankroll their street life ac-
tivities. They do not have to neutralize con-
ventional values, because they have none.
Rather than neutralizing conventional 
values, hard-core criminals often have to 
neutralize deviant values: they are expected 
to be “bad” and have to explain good be-
havior. Even if they themselves are the vic-
tims of crime, they can never help police 
or even talk to them, a practice defined as 
snitching and universally despised and dis-
couraged. Smokedog, a carjacker and drug 
dealer, described the anticipated guilt of 
colluding with the police in this way, “You 
know I ain’t never told on nobody and I ain’t 
never gonna tell on nobody ’cause I would 
feel funny in the world if I told on some-
body. You know, I would feel funny, I would 
have regrets about what I did.”
Street criminals are also expected to 
seek vengeance if they are the target of 
theft or violence. If they don’t, their self-
image is damaged, and they look weak 
and ineffective. If they decide against ven-
geance, they must neutralize their decision 
by convincing themselves that they are be-
ing merciful, respecting direct appeals by 
their target’s family and friends. T-dog, a 
young drug dealer and car thief, told Topalli 
how he neutralized the decision not to seek 
revenge by allowing his uncle to “calm him 
down.” The older man, a robber and drug 
dealer himself, intervened before T-dog 
could leave his house armed with two 9mm 
automatics: “That’s basically what he told 
me, ‘Calm down.’ He took both my guns 
and gave me a little .22 to carry when I’m 
out to put me back on my feet. Gave me an 
ounce of crack and a pound of weed. That’s 
what made me let it go.” In other cases, 
offenders claimed the target was just not 
worth the effort, reserving their vengeance 
for those who were worthy opponents.
Do these findings indicate that neutral-
ization theory is invalid? Topalli concludes 
that the strength of the theory is its empha-
sis on cognitive processes that occur prior 
to offending. He suggests that neutraliza-
tion theory’s current emphasis on a con-
ventional cultural value orientation must be 
expanded to accommodate the values of 
the street culture.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Are there deviant norms and values that 
you have to neutralize in order to engage 
in conventional behaviors? What neutral-
izations have you come up with in order 
to save face when your friends wanted 
to engage in some forms of deviance but 
you decided not to take the risk?
 2. Do you agree with Topalli that kids in 
disorganized neighborhoods shun con-
ventional values? Or do you agree with 
Sykes and Matza that everyone shares 
conventional norms and values?
SOURCES: Volkan Topalli, “When Being Good Is 
Bad: An Expansion of Neutralization Theory,” 
Criminology 43 (2005): 797–836.
When Being Good Is Bad
In their neutralization theory, Sykes and 
Matza claim that neutralizations provide of-
fenders with a means of preserving a non-
criminal self-concept even as they engage 
in crime and deviance. Sykes and Matza’s 
vision assumes that most criminals believe 
in conventional norms and values and must 
use neutralizations in order to shield them-
selves from the shame attached to criminal 
activity. Recent research by criminologist 
Volkan Topalli finds that Sykes and Matza 
may have ignored the influential street 
culture that exists in highly disadvantaged 
neighborhoods. Using data gleaned from 
191 in-depth interviews with active crimi-
nals in St. Louis, Missouri, Topalli finds 
that street criminals living in disorganized, 
gang-ridden neighborhoods “disrespect 
authority, lionize honor and violence, and 
place individual needs above those of all 
others.” Rather than having to neutralize 
conventional values in order to engage in 
deviant ones, these offenders do not experi-
ence guilt that requires neutralizations; they 
are “guilt free.” There is no need for them 
to “drift” into criminality, Topalli finds, be-
cause their allegiance to nonconventional 
values and lack of guilt perpetually leave 
them in a state of openness to crime.
Rather than being contrite or ashamed, 
the offenders Topalli interviewed took great 
pride in their criminal activities and abili-
ties. Bacca, a street robber who attacked 
a long-time neighbor without provocation, 
exemplified such sentiments:
Actually I felt proud of myself just 
for robbing him, just for doing what 
I did I felt proud of myself. I didn’t 
feel like I did anything wrong, I 
didn’t feel like I lost a friend ’cause 
the friends I do have . . . are lost, 
they’re dead. I feel like I don’t have 
anything to lose. I wanted to do just 
what I wanted to do.

CHAPTER 7 | Social Process Theories: Socialization and Society  245
SOCIAL CONTROL THEORY
Social control theories maintain that all people have the po-
tential to violate the law and that modern society presents 
many opportunities for illegal activity. Criminal activities, 
such as drug abuse and car theft, are often exciting pastimes 
that hold the promise of immediate reward and gratifi cation.
Considering the attractions of crime, the question con-
trol theorists pose is: why do people obey the rules of so-
ciety? A choice theorist would respond that it is the fear of 
punishment; structural theorists would say that obedience 
is a function of having access to legitimate opportunities; 
learning theorists would explain that obedience is acquired 
through contact with law-abiding parents and peers. In 
contrast, social control theorists argue that people obey the 
law because behavior and passions are being controlled by 
internal and external forces. Because they have been prop-
erly socialized, most people have developed a strong moral 
sense, which renders them incapable of hurting others and 
violating social norms. They develop a commitment to 
conformity, which requires that they obey the rules of soci-
ety.121 Properly socialized people believe that getting caught 
at criminal activity will hurt a dearly loved parent or jeop-
ardize their chance at a college scholarship, or perhaps they 
feel that their job will be forfeited if they get in trouble with 
the law. In other words, people’s behavior, including criminal 
activity, is controlled by their attachment and commitment 
to conventional institutions, individuals, and processes. On 
the other hand, those who have not been properly social-
ized, who lack a commitment to others or themselves, are 
free to violate the law and engage in deviant behavior. Those 
who are “uncommitted” are not deterred by the threat of le-
gal punishments because they have little to lose.122
Self-Concept and Crime
Early versions of control theory speculated that control 
was a product of social interactions. Maladaptive social re-
lations produced weak self-concept and poor self-esteem, 
rendering kids at risk to crime. In contrast, youths who 
felt good about themselves and maintained a positive at-
titude were able to resist the temptations of the streets. 
As early as 1951, sociologist Albert Reiss described how 
delinquents had weak egos.123 Scott Briar and Irving Pili-
avin noted that youths who believe criminal activity will 
damage their self-image and their relationships with others 
will be most likely to conform to social rules; they have 
a commitment to conformity. In contrast, those less con-
cerned about their social standing are free to violate the 
law.124 In his containment theory, pioneering control 
theorist Walter Reckless argued that a strong self-image 
Are Learning Theories Valid?
Learning theories make a significant contribution to our 
understanding of the onset of criminal behavior. Nonethe-
less, the general learning model has been subject to some 
criticism. One complaint is that learning theorists fail to ac-
count for the origin of criminal defi nitions. How did the fi rst 
“teacher” learn criminal techniques and defi nitions? Who 
came up with the original neutralization technique? And, 
as The Criminological Enterprise feature suggests, hard core 
offenders feel little need to neutralize moral restraints—they 
may not have any!
Learning theories also imply that people systemati-
cally learn techniques that enable them to be active and 
successful criminals, but they fail to adequately explain 
spontaneous and wanton acts of violence and damage and 
other expressive crimes that appear to have little utility 
or purpose. Principles of differential association can eas-
ily explain shoplifting, but is it possible that a random 
shooting is caused by excessive deviant defi nitions? It is 
estimated that about 70 percent of all arrestees were un-
der the infl uence of drugs and alcohol when they com-
mitted their crime. Do “crack heads” pause to neutralize 
their moral inhibitions before mugging a victim? Do drug-
involved kids stop to consider what they have “learned” 
about moral values?120
Little evidence exists substantiating that people learn 
the techniques that enable them to become criminals before 
they actually commit criminal acts. It is equally plausible 
that people who are already deviant seek out others with 
similar lifestyles. Early onset of deviant behavior is now 
considered a key determinant of criminal careers. It is dif-
fi cult to see how extremely young adolescents had the op-
portunity to learn criminal behavior and attitudes within a 
peer group setting.
Despite these criticisms, learning theories maintain an 
important place in the study of delinquent and criminal be-
havior. Unlike social structure theories, these theories are 
not limited to the explanation of a single facet of antiso-
cial activity—for example, lower-class gang activity; they 
may be used to explain criminality across all class struc-
tures. Even corporate executives may be exposed to a vari-
ety of procriminal defi nitions and learn to neutralize moral 
constraints.

246  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Though his work has achieved a prominent place in 
criminological literature, Hirschi, along with Michael 
Gottfredson, has restructured his concept of control by 
integrating biosocial, psychological, and rational choice 
theory ideas into a “General Theory of Crime.” This the-
ory of self-control is discussed more fully in Chapter 9.
CONNECTIONS
Elements of the Social Bond Hirschi argues that the so-
cial bond a person maintains with society is divided into 
four main elements: attachment, commitment, involvement, 
and belief (Figure 7.4).
Attachment. 
 
■
Attachment refers to a person’s sensitivity to 
and interest in others.128 Without a sense of attachment, 
psychologists believe a person becomes a psychopath 
and loses the ability to relate coherently to the world. 
The acceptance of social norms and the development 
of a social conscience depend on attachment to and 
caring for other human beings. Hirschi views parents, 
peers, and schools as the important social institutions 
with which a person should maintain ties. Attachment 
to parents is the most important. Even if a family is 
shattered by divorce or separation, a child must retain a 
strong attachment to one or both parents. Without this 
attachment, it is unlikely that feelings of respect for oth-
ers in authority will develop.
insulates a youth from the pressures and pulls of crimi-
nogenic influences in the environment.125 In a series of 
studies conducted within the school setting, Reckless and 
his colleagues found that nondelinquent youths are able to 
maintain a positive self-image in the face of environmental 
pressures toward delinquency.126
It is Travis Hirschi’s vision of social control, articulated 
in his highly infl uential 1969 book Causes of Delinquency, 
that remains the dominant version of the theory.127
Hirschi’s Social Bond Theory
In his insightful work, Hirschi links the onset of criminal-
ity to the weakening of the ties that bind people to society. 
He assumes that all individuals are potential law violators, 
but they are kept under control because they fear that il-
legal behavior will damage their relationships with friends, 
parents, neighbors, teachers, and employers. Without these 
social ties or bonds, and in the absence of sensitivity to and 
interest in others, a person is free to commit criminal acts. 
Hirschi does not view society as containing competing sub-
cultures with unique value systems. Most people are aware 
of the prevailing moral and legal codes. He suggests, how-
ever, that in all elements of society people vary in how they 
respond to conventional social rules and values. Among all 
ethnic, religious, racial, and social groups, people whose 
bond to society is weak may fall prey to criminogenic be-
havior patterns.

CHAPTER 7 | Social Process Theories: Socialization and Society  247
Those who shunned unconventional acts were attached 
 
■
to their peers.
Delinquents and nondelinquents shared similar beliefs 
 
■
about society.
Supporting Research Hirschi’s data lent important sup-
port to the validity of control theory. Even when the statisti-
cal signifi cance of his fi ndings was less than he expected, the 
direction of his research data was notably consistent. Only 
in very rare instances did his fi ndings contradict the theory’s 
most critical assumptions.
Hirschi’s version of social control theory has been cor-
roborated by numerous research studies, in the United 
States and abroad, showing that delinquent youth often feel 
detached from society.132 Their relationships within the fam-
ily, peer group, and school often appear strained, indicative 
of a weakened social bond.133 Associations among indicators 
of lack of attachment, belief, commitment, and involvement 
with measures of delinquency have tended to be positive 
and signifi cant.134 In contrast, strong positive attachments 
help control delinquency.135
Attachment. 
 
■
Research indicates that, as Hirschi predicts, 
kids who are attached to their families, friends, and 
school are less likely to get involved in a deviant peer 
group and consequently less likely to engage in criminal 
activities.136 Teens who are attached to their parents are 
also able to develop the social skills that equip them 
both to maintain harmonious social ties and to escape 
life stresses such as school failure.137 In contrast, family 
detachment—including intrafamily confl ict, abuse of 
children, and lack of affection, supervision, and family 
pride—are predictive of delinquent conduct.138
  Attachment to education is equally important. Youths 
who are detached from the educational experience are at 
risk of criminality; those who are committed to school 
are less likely to engage in delinquent acts.139 Detach-
ment and alienation from school may be even more 
predictive of delinquency than school failure and/or 
educational underachievement.140
Belief. 
 
■
There is support for Hirschi’s view that holding 
positive beliefs is inversely related to criminality. Chil-
dren who are involved in religious activities and hold 
conventional religious beliefs are less likely to become 
involved in substance abuse.141 Kids who live in areas 
marked by strong religious values and who hold strong 
religious beliefs themselves are less likely to engage in 
delinquent activities than adolescents who do not hold 
such beliefs or who live in less devout communities.142
Commitment. 
 
■
As predicted by Hirschi, kids who are 
committed to future success and achievement are less 
likely to become involved in delinquent behaviors than 
those who lack such commitment.143
Involvement. 
 
■
Research shows that youths who are in-
volved in conventional leisure activities, such as super-
vised social activities and noncompetitive sports, are 
Commitment. 
 
■
Commitment involves the time, energy, 
and effort expended in conventional lines of action, 
such as getting an education and saving money for 
the future. If people build a strong commitment to 
conventional society, they will be less likely to engage 
in acts that will jeopardize their hard-won position. 
Conversely, the lack of commitment to conventional 
values may foreshadow a condition in which risk-taking 
behavior, such as crime, becomes a reasonable behavior 
alternative. The association may be reciprocal. Kids who 
drink and engage in deviant behavior are more likely to 
fail in school; kids who fail in school are more likely to 
later drink and engage in deviant behavior.129
Involvement. 
 
■
Heavy involvement in conventional activi-
ties leaves little time for illegal behavior. When people 
become involved in school, recreation, and family, 
Hirschi believes, it insulates them from the potential 
lure of criminal behavior, whereas idleness enhances it.
Belief. 
 
■
People who live in the same social setting often 
share common moral beliefs; they may adhere to such 
values as sharing, sensitivity to the rights of others, and 
admiration for the legal code. If these beliefs are absent 
or weakened, individuals are more likely to participate 
in antisocial or illegal acts.
Hirschi further suggests that the interrelationship of social 
bond elements controls subsequent behavior. People who 
feel kinship and sensitivity to parents and friends should be 
more likely to adopt and work toward legitimate goals or 
gain skills that help them avoid antisocial or dangerous be-
haviors. Girls, for example, who have higher levels of bond-
ing to parents and develop good social skills in adolescence 
are less likely to experience dating violence as young adults. 
The reason: a close bond to parents reduces early adolescent 
alcohol use, a factor that shields girls from victimization.130
Testing Social Bond Theory One of Hirschi’s most signif-
icant contributions was his attempt to test the principal hy-
potheses of social bond theory. He administered a detailed 
self-report survey to a sample of more than 4,000 junior and 
senior high school students in Contra Costa County, Cali-
fornia.131 In a detailed analysis of the data, Hirschi found 
considerable evidence to support the control theory model. 
Among Hirschi’s more important fi ndings are the following:
Youths who were strongly attached to their parents were 
 
■
less likely to commit criminal acts.
Commitment to conventional values, such as striving 
 
■
to get a good education and refusing to drink alcohol 
and “cruise around,” was indicative of conventional 
behavior.
Youths involved in conventional activity, such as home-
 
■
work, were less likely to engage in criminal behavior.
Youths involved in unconventional behavior, such as 
 
■
smoking and drinking, were more delinquency prone.
Youths who maintained weak and distant relationships 
 
■
with people tended toward delinquency.

248  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Here are some elements that have come under criticism and 
need further study:
Friendship. 
 
■
One signifi cant criticism concerns Hirschi’s 
contention that delinquents are detached loners whose 
bond to their family and friends has been broken. Some 
critics have questioned whether delinquents (a) do have 
strained relations with family and peers and (b) may be 
infl uenced by close relationships with deviant peers and 
family members. A number of research efforts do show 
that delinquents maintain relationships with deviant 
peers and are infl uenced by members of their deviant 
peer group.149 Delinquents, however, may not be “lone 
wolves” whose only personal relationships are exploitive; 
their friendship patterns seem quite close to those of 
conventional youth.150 In fact, some types of offenders, 
such as drug abusers, may maintain even more intimate 
relations with their peers than nonabusers.151 Hirschi 
would counter that what appears to be a close friendship 
is really a relationship of convenience and that “birds of 
a feather fl ock together” only when it suits their criminal 
activities. His view is supported by recent research con-
ducted by criminologists Lisa Stolzenberg and Stewart 
D’Alessio, who found that most juvenile offenses are 
committed by individuals acting alone and that group 
less likely to engage in delinquency than those who are 
involved in unconventional leisure activities and un-
supervised, peer-oriented social pursuits.144 One study 
found that students who engage in a signifi cant amount 
of extracurricular activities from 8th grade through 
12th grade are more likely to experience high academic 
achievement and prosocial behaviors extending into 
young adulthood.145
Cross-national surveys have also supported the general 
findings of Hirschi’s control theory.146 For example, one 
study of Canadian youth found that perception of paren-
tal attachment was the strongest predictor of delinquent or 
law-abiding behavior. Teens who are attached to their par-
ents may develop the social skills that equip them both to 
maintain harmonious social ties and to escape life stresses 
such as school failure.147
The Profi les in Crime feature describes a case that may 
rest on a frayed and tattered bond to society.
Opposing Views A great deal of scholarly research has 
been conducted to corroborate social control theory by rep-
licating Hirschi’s original survey techniques.148 There has 
been signifi cant empirical support for Hirschi’s work, but 
there are also those who question some or all of its elements. 
kids who came and went at all hours of the 
day. Jesse was a popular guy, an outgoing 
kid who, despite being short in stature, was 
an excellent athlete. How was Jesse able 
to do all this? Unknown to many, he was a 
large-scale marijuana dealer.
Jesse’s world began to unravel when he 
came up with a scheme to get money owed 
to him by Benjamin Markowitz, 22, who was 
one of his customers. Hollywood and some 
friends headed for Markowitz’s family home 
on August 6, 2000, planning to kidnap him 
and hold him for ransom. On the way there, 
Jesse and his friends spotted Markowitz’s 
15-year-old stepbrother, Nicholas, whom  
they kidnapped and held for a few days. 
Mistakenly believing they would receive life 
sentences for kidnapping, they forced Nick 
Markowitz to walk a mile into Los Padres Na-
tional Forest before being shot and buried in 
a shallow grave. His body was discovered four 
days later by hikers.
Four other kids were tried and con-
victed in the case, but Hollywood escaped

Alpha Dog
In November of 2005, twenty-five-year-
old Jesse James Hollywood (that is his 
real name) was enjoying a comfortable life 
in Brazil, teaching English and living in a 
fashionable neighborhood, when he was ar-
rested and sent back to California to face 
charges of kidnapping and killing a 15-year-
old boy.
His story is rather unique. Even though 
Hollywood had never held a job, he was able, 
by age 19, to purchase a $200,000 house in 
West Hills, California, and a Mercedes. His 
place became a favorite hangout for local

and became the subject of an international 
manhunt, his mug shot plastered on the 
FBI’s website. He wound up in Brazil, where 
he used fake papers that identified him as 
Michael Costa Giroux, a native of Rio de Ja-
neiro. Cooperating with the FBI, Brazilian 
authorities deported him as an illegal alien. 
On July 8, 2009, a jury found him guilty of 
kidnapping and first-degree murder with 
special circumstances; afterward Hollywood 
was sentenced to life in prison.
The 2006 film Alpha Dog, starring Bruce 
Willis, Justin Timberlake, and Sharon Stone, 
is based on the case.

CHAPTER 7 | Social Process Theories: Socialization and Society  249
Changing bonds. 
 
■
Social bonds seem to change over time, 
a phenomenon ignored by Hirschi.1163 It is possible that 
at one age level, weak bonds (to parents) lead to delin-
quency, while at another, strong bonds (to peers) lead to 
delinquency.
Crime and social bonds. 
 
■
It is possible that Hirschi mis-
calculated the direction of the relationship between 
criminality and a weakened social bond.164 Social bond 
theory projects that a weakened bond leads to delin-
quency, but it is possible that the chain of events may 
fl ow in the opposite direction: kids who break the law 
fi nd that their bond to parents, schools, and society 
eventually becomes weak and attenuated.165
Although these criticisms need to be addressed with 
further research, the weight of existing empirical evidence 
supports control theory, and it has emerged as one of the 
preeminent theories in criminology. For many criminolo-
gists, it is perhaps the most important way of understanding 
the onset of youthful misbehavior.
SOCIAL REACTION THEORY
Social reaction theory, commonly called labeling theory (the 
two terms are used interchangeably here), explains how 
criminal careers form based on destructive social interac-
tions and encounters. Its roots are found in the symbolic 
interaction theory of sociologists Charles Horton Cooley 
and George Herbert Mead, and later, Herbert Blumer.166 
Symbolic interaction theory holds that people communicate 
offending, when it does occur, is incidental and of little 
importance to explaining the onset of delinquency.152
Not all elements of the bond are equal. 
 
■
Hirschi makes little 
distinction between the importance of each element 
of the social bond, yet research evidence suggests that 
there may be differences. Some adolescents who report 
high levels of “involvement,” which Hirschi suggests 
should reduce delinquency, are involved in criminal 
behavior. As kids get involved in behaviors outside the 
home, it is possible that parental control weakens, and 
youths have greater opportunity to commit crime.153 
When asked, children report that concepts such as “in-
volvement” and “belief” have relatively little infl uence 
over behavior patterns.”154
Deviant involvement.
 
■
 Adolescents who report high levels 
of involvement, which Hirschi suggests should reduce 
delinquency, actually report high levels of criminal 
behavior. Typically, these are kids who are involved in 
activities outside the home without parental supervi-
sion.155 Kids who spend a lot of time hanging out with 
their friends, unsupervised by parents and/or other 
authority fi gures, and who own cars that give them the 
mobility to get into even more trouble are the ones most 
likely to get involved in antisocial acts such as drink-
ing and taking drugs.156 This is especially true of dat-
ing relationships: kids who date, especially if they have 
multiple partners, are the ones who are likely to get into 
trouble and engage in delinquent acts.157 It is possible 
that although involvement is important, it depends on 
the behavior in which a person is involved!
Deviant peers and parents. 
 
■
Hirschi’s conclusion that any 
form of social attachment is benefi cial, even to deviant 
peers and parents, has also been disputed. Rather than 
deter delinquency attachment to deviant peers, it 
may support and nurture antisocial behavior. In 
a now classic study, criminologist Michael Hinde-
lang found that attachment to delinquent peers 
escalated rather than restricted criminality.158 In a 
similar fashion, a number of research efforts have 
found that youths attached to drug-abusing par-
ents are more likely to become drug users them-
selves.159 Attachment to deviant family members, 
peers, and associates may help motivate youths 
to commit crime and facilitate their antisocial 
acts.160
Restricted in scope. 
 
■
There is some question as to 
whether the theory can explain all modes of crim-
inality (as Hirschi maintains) or is restricted to 
particular groups or forms of criminality. Control 
variables seem better able to explain minor de-
linquency (such as alcohol and marijuana abuse) 
than more serious criminal acts and associations 
(such as the association between child abuse and 
violence).161 Research efforts have found control 
variables are more predictive of female than male 
behavior.162 Perhaps girls are more deeply infl u-
enced by the quality of their bond to society.

According to labeling theory, perceptions guide behavior. Would you want to 
invite this guy to lunch with your family? He is The Scary Guy (his real name) 
and he spends his time teaching students and adults about what they can do 
to change the world by taking responsibility for their own behavior. His mission 
is to eliminate hate, violence, and prejudice worldwide. He is shown here 
hammering home his message at Valencia Middle School in Tucson, Arizona.

exclude them from social 
opportunities, including 
housing and work. In 
contrast, self-stigma oc-
curs when negative social 
attitudes are internalized, 
subsequently harming 
a person’s self-esteem, 
and inducing shame. If 
during the self-stigma 
process a devalued sta-
tus is conferred by a sig-
nificant other—teacher, 
police offi cer, elder, par-
ent, or valued peer—the 
negative label may cause 
permanent harm. The 
degree to which a person 
is perceived as a social 
deviant may affect his or 
her treatment at home, 
at work, at school, and 
in other social situations. 
Children may find that 
their parents consider 
them a bad infl uence on 
younger brothers and 
sisters. School officials 
may limit them to classes 
reserved for people with 
behavioral problems. 
Likewise, when adults are 
labeled as criminal, ex-
con, or drug addict, they 
may fi nd their eligibility 
for employment severely 
restricted. Furthermore, 
if the label is bestowed as 
the result of conviction 
for a criminal offense, the 
labeled person may be 
subjected to offi cial sanc-
tions ranging from a mild 
reprimand to incarceration.
Beyond these immediate results, labeling advocates 
maintain that, depending on the visibility of the label and 
the manner and severity with which it is applied, a person 
will have an increasing commitment to a deviant career. 
They may be watched and become the leading suspect when 
a similar crime occurs. Labeled people may fi nd themselves 
turning to others similarly stigmatized for support and com-
panionship. Isolated from conventional society, they may 
identify themselves as members of an outcast group and 
become locked into a deviant career. Figure 7.5 illustrates 
this process. The Thinking Like a Criminologist feature ad-
dresses this issue.
via symbols—gestures, signs, words, or images—that stand 
for or represent something else. For example, a gold band 
on your ring fi nger conveys many meanings: married; sta-
ble; sexually off limits; conventional.
People interpret symbolic gestures from others and in-
corporate them in their self-image. When a teacher puts an 
A on your paper, it tells you that you are an excellent stu-
dent, and the symbol pumps up your self-image. Symbols 
are used by others to let people know how well they are 
doing and whether they are liked or appreciated. Wearing 
a Rolex and driving a Mercedes is a symbolic way of let-
ting people know that you are quite successful. Designer 
clothes display their symbol to let people know that the 
wearer has both taste and income. How people view reality 
then depends on the content of the messages and situations 
they encounter, the subjective interpretation of these inter-
actions, and how they shape future behavior. There is no 
objective reality. When someone takes another person’s life, 
it could be self-defense or cold-blooded murder, depend-
ing on how people interpret the act. The police offi cer who 
punches a suspect may, depending on how people interpret 
the incident, get a medal for subduing a dangerous crimi-
nal or be suspended for police brutality. Because interpreta-
tion changes over time, so do the meanings of concepts and 
symbols.
Social reaction theory picks up on these concepts of 
interaction and interpretation.167 Throughout their lives, 
people are given a variety of symbolic labels and ways to 
interact with others. These labels represent behavior and 
attitude characteristics; labels help define not just one 
trait but the whole person. People labeled insane are also 
assumed to be dangerous, dishonest, unstable, violent, 
strange, and otherwise unsound. Valued labels, including 
smart, honest, and hard working, suggest overall com-
petence. These labels can improve self-image and social 
standing. Research shows that people who are labeled with 
one positive trait, such as being physically attractive, are 
assumed to maintain other traits, such as being intelligent 
and competent.168 In contrast, negative labels—including 
troublemaker, mentally ill, and stupid—help stigmatize 
the recipients of these labels and reduce their self-image. 
Those who have accepted these labels are more prone to 
engage in deviant behaviors than those whose self-image 
has not been so tarnished.169
Both positive and negative labels involve subjective inter-
pretation of behavior: a troublemaker is merely someone people 
label as troublesome. There need not be any objective proof or 
measure indicating that the person is actually a troublemaker. 
Though a label may be a function of rumor, innuendo, or un-
founded suspicion, its adverse impact can be immense.
Patrick Corrigan notes that labeling and stigma can harm 
and diminish both the public and private self. Some groups 
bear public stigma, and being labeled as part of a stigmatized 
group “robs people of social opportunities.”170 Public stigma 
occurs when there is prejudice about a group that stigma-
tizes members (i.e., sex workers, mental patients) and helps

The difference between a forcible rape and a consensual 
sexual encounter often rests on whom the members of a jury 
believe and how they interpret the events that took place. 
The difference between an excusable act and a criminal one 
is often subject to change and modifi cation. Remember Ge-
narlow Wilson: was he a sex offender or a kid who partied 
too much? It depends on your viewpoint and the view of 
those in power. Acts such as performing an abortion, using 
marijuana, possessing a handgun, and gambling have been 
legal at some times and places and illegal at others.
Differential Enforcement
An important principle of social reaction theory is that the law 
is differentially applied, benefi ting those who hold economic 
and social power and penalizing the powerless. The probabil-
ity of being brought under the control of legal authority is a 
function of a person’s race, wealth, gender, and social stand-
ing. A core concept of social reaction theory is that police of-
fi cers are more likely to suspect, question, search, and arrest 
males, minority group members, and those in the lower class 
and to use their discretionary powers to give benefi cial treat-
ment to more favored groups.175 The term racial profi ling
has been used to signify that police suspicion is often directed 
at minority group males. Minorities and the poor are more 
likely to be prosecuted for criminal offenses and to receive 
harsher punishments when convicted.176 Judges may sym-
pathize with white defendants and help them avoid criminal 
labels, especially if they seem to come from “good families,” 
whereas minority defendants are not afforded that luxury.177
This evidence is used to support the labeling concept 
that personal characteristics and social interactions are 
Interpreting Crime
Labeling theorists use an interactionist defi nition of crime. 
In a defining statement, sociologist Kai Erickson argues, 
“Deviance is not a property inherent in certain forms of be-
havior, it is a property conferred upon those forms by the 
audience which directly or indirectly witnesses them.”171
Crime and deviance, therefore, are defi ned by the social au-
dience’s reaction to people and their behavior and the sub-
sequent effects of that reaction; they are not defi ned by the 
moral content of the illegal act itself.172
In another famous statement, Howard Becker sums up 
the importance of the audience’s reaction:
Social groups create deviance by making rules whose in-
fractions constitute deviance, and by applying those rules 
to particular people and labeling them as outsiders. From 
this point of view, deviance is not a quality of the act a 
person commits, but rather a consequence of the applica-
tion by others of rules and sanctions to an “offender.” The 
deviant is one to whom the label has successfully been ap-
plied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so label.173
In its purest form, social reaction theory argues that 
such crimes as murder, rape, and assault are only bad or 
evil because people label them as such. After all, the differ-
ence between an excusable act and a criminal one is often a 
matter of legal defi nition, which changes from place to place 
and from year to year. 
Becker refers to people who create rules as moral entre-
preneurs. An example of a moral entrepreneur today might 
be members of an ultra-orthodox religious group who target 
the gay lifestyle and mount a campaign to prevent gays from 
adopting children or conducting same-sex marriages.174
The principal of the local high school, a big 
fan of control theory (she used to be in your 
class), asks for your opinion on a new policy 
she intends to propose to the school board. 
She wants to increase students’ bond to edu-
cation and the school experience by creating 
three tracks of students: one college bound, 
the other average, and the third for kids 
who need remedial help. The college-bound 
would take advanced math and science, the 
average track would be reserved for those 
who plan to forgo college, and the remedial 
track would offer less-challenging course work and be designed 
to get the students through high school. She argues that the 
college-bound students will be recognized for 
their achievements and rewarded for their efforts, 
a process that will solidify their bond to the edu-
cational experience, all the while insulating them 
from more disruptive teens.
❯❯ Write a memo to the principal commenting on 
the ethics of this approach: Is it fair to reward one 
group of students while isolating another? What 
would be the consequences of such a policy? Would 
it encourage the better students to achieve or might 
it damage those who do not fall in the elite group? 
Would such a policy negatively label and stigmatize kids who 
were not in the college-bound track?

enjoying a higher education, well-paying jobs, and other so-
cial benefi ts. Such alienation leads to a low self-image.
Joining Deviant Cliques When people are labeled as de-
viant, they may join up with similarly outcast delinquent 
peers who facilitate their behavior.190 Eventually, antisocial 
behavior becomes habitual and automatic.191 The desire to 
join deviant cliques and groups may stem from a self-reject-
ing attitude (“at times, I think I am no good at all”), which 
eventually results in a weakened commitment to conven-
tional values and behaviors. In turn, these people may ac-
quire motives to deviate from social norms. Facilitating this 
attitude and value transformation is the bond social outcasts 
form with similarly labeled peers in the form of a deviant 
subculture.192
Membership in a deviant subculture often involves con-
forming to group norms that conflict with those of con-
ventional society. Deviant behaviors that defy conventional 
values can serve a number of different purposes. Some acts 
are designed to show contempt for the source of the nega-
tive labels. Other acts are planned to distance the transgres-
sor from further contact with the source of criticism (for 
example, an adolescent runs away from critical parents).193
Retrospective Reading After someone is labeled because 
of some unusual or inexplicable act, people begin to re-
construct the culprit’s identity so that the act and the label 
become understandable (e.g., “we always knew there was 
something wrong with that boy”). It is not unusual for the 
media to lead the way and interview boyhood friends of an 
assassin or serial killer. On the 11 o’clock news we can hear 
them report that the suspect was withdrawn, suspicious, 
and negativistic as a youth, expressing violent thoughts and 
ideation, a loner, troubled, and so on. Yet, until now no one 
was suspicious and nothing was done. This is referred to as 
retrospective reading, a process in which the past of the 
labeled person is reviewed and reevaluated to fi t his or her 
current status. By conducting a retrospective reading, we 
can now understand what prompted his current behavior; 
therefore, the label must be accurate.194 
Dramatization of Evil Labels become the basis of per-
sonal identity. As the negative feedback of law enforcement 
agencies, parents, friends, teachers, and other fi gures am-
plifi es the force of the original label, stigmatized offenders 
may begin to reevaluate their own identities. If they are not 
really evil or bad, they may ask themselves, why is everyone 
making such a fuss? Frank Tannenbaum, a social reaction 
theory pioneer, referred to this process as the dramatiza-
tion of evil. With respect to the consequences of labeling 
delinquent behavior, Tannenbaum stated:
The process of making the criminal, therefore, is a 
process of tagging, defi ning, identifying, making con-
scious and self-conscious; it becomes a way of stimu-
lating, suggesting and evoking the very traits that are 
more important variables in developing criminal careers 
than merely violating the law. Social reaction theorists also 
argue that the content of the law reflects power relation-
ships in society. They point to the evidence that white-collar 
crimes—economic crimes usually committed by members 
of the upper class—are most often punished by a relatively 
small fi ne and rarely result in a prison sentence. This treat-
ment contrasts with long prison sentences given to those 
convicted of “street crimes,” such as burglary or car theft, 
which are the province of the lower, powerless classes.178
In sum, a major premise of social reaction theory is that 
the law is differentially constructed and applied, depending 
on the offenders. It favors the powerful members of soci-
ety who direct its content and penalizes people whose ac-
tions represent a threat to those in control, such as minority 
group members and the poor who demand equal rights.179
Consequences of Labeling
This labeling process is important because once they are stig-
matized as troublemakers, adolescents begin to reassess their 
self-image. Parents who label their children as troublemakers 
promote deviance amplifi cation. Labeling alienates parents 
from their children, and negative labels reduce children’s 
self-image and increase delinquency; this process is referred 
to as refl ected appraisals.180 Parental labeling is extremely 
damaging because it may cause adolescents to seek deviant 
peers whose behavior amplifi es the effect of the labeling.181
As they mature, children are in danger of receiving re-
peated, intensive, offi cial labeling, which has been shown to 
produce self-labeling and to damage identities.182 Kids who 
perceive that they have been negatively labeled by signifi -
cant others, such as peers and teachers, are also more likely 
to self-report delinquent behavior and to adopt a deviant 
self-concept.183 They are likely to make deviant friends and 
join gangs, associations that escalate their involvement in 
criminal activities.184 If their deviant activities land them 
in court, the effects can be devastating. An offi cial label in-
creases the risk of their later dropping out of high school. 
Rather than deterring crime, court intervention increases 
the likelihood of future criminality.185 Ironically, the offi cial 
labeling process may take a greater toll on novice criminals 
than on more experienced offenders—a consequence that 
indicates the power of negative labels.186
As these youth become adults, the labeling process contin-
ues to take its toll. Male drug users labeled as addicts by social 
control agencies eventually become self-labeled and increase 
their drug use.187 People arrested in domestic violence cases, 
especially those with a low stake in conformity (for example, 
those who are jobless and unmarried), increase offending after 
being given offi cial labels.188 And once in prison, inmates la-
beled high risk are more likely to have disciplinary problems 
than those who are spared such negative labels.189
Labels are believed to produce stigma. The labeled devi-
ant becomes a social outcast who may be prevented from

CHAPTER 7 | Social Process Theories: Socialization and Society  253
according to Lemert, “employs his behavior or a role based 
upon it as a means of defense, attack, or adjustment to the 
overt and covert problems created by the consequent social 
reaction to him.”197 Secondary deviance produces a deviance 
amplifi cation effect. Offenders feel isolated from the main-
stream of society and become fi rmly locked within their de-
viant role. They may seek out others similarly labeled to form 
deviant subcultures or groups. Ever more fi rmly enmeshed 
in their deviant role, they are locked into an escalating cycle 
of deviance, apprehension, more powerful labels, and iden-
tity transformation. Lemert’s concept of secondary deviance 
expresses the core of social reaction theory: deviance is a pro-
cess in which one’s identity is transformed. Efforts to control 
the offenders, whether by treatment or punishment, simply 
help lock them in their deviant role.
Research on Social Reaction Theory
Research on social reaction theory can be classified into 
two distinct categories. The fi rst focuses on the character-
istics of offenders who are chosen for labels. The theory 
maintains that these offenders should be relatively power-
less people who are unable to defend themselves against 
the negative labeling. The second type of research attempts 
to discover the effects of being labeled. Labeling theorists 
predict that people who are negatively labeled should view 
themselves as deviant and commit increasing amounts of 
criminal behavior.
Who Gets Labeled? The poor and powerless people 
are victimized by the law and justice system; labels are 
not equally distributed across class and racial lines. Crit-
ics charge that although substantive and procedural laws 
govern almost every aspect of the American criminal jus-
tice system, discretionary decision making controls its op-
eration at every level. From the police offi cer’s decision on 
whom to arrest to the prosecutor’s decisions on whom to 
charge and for how many and what kind of charges, to 
the court’s decision on whom to release or on whom to 
permit bail, to the grand jury’s decision on indictment, to 
the judge’s decision on the length of the sentence, discre-
tion works to the detriment of minorities, including Af-
rican Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native 
Americans.198
Although these arguments are persuasive, little defi nitive 
evidence exists that the justice system is inherently unfair 
and biased. Procedures such as arrest, prosecution, and sen-
tencing seem to be more often based on legal factors, such 
as prior record and severity of the crime, than on personal 
characteristics, such as class and race.199 However, it is pos-
sible that discriminatory practices in the labeling process are 
subtle and hidden. For example, in a thorough review of sen-
tencing disparity, Samuel Walker, Cassia Spohn, and Miriam 
DeLone identify what they call contextual discrimination. 
This term refers to judges’ practices in some jurisdictions of 
complained of. If the theory of relation of response to 
stimulus has any meaning, the entire process of dealing 
with the young delinquent is mischievous insofar as 
it identifi es him to himself or to the environment as a 
delinquent person. The person becomes the thing he is 
described as being.195
Primary and Secondary Deviance
One of the best-known views of the labeling process is 
Edwin Lemert’s concept of primary deviance and second-
ary deviance.196 According to Lemert, primary deviance 
involves norm violations or crimes that have very little in-
fl uence on the actor and can be quickly forgotten. For ex-
ample, a college student takes a “fi ve-fi nger discount” at the 
campus bookstore. He successfully steals a textbook, uses 
it to get an A in a course, goes on to graduate, is admitted 
into law school, and later becomes a famous judge. Because 
his shoplifting goes unnoticed, it is a relatively unimportant 
event that has little bearing on his future life.
In contrast, secondary deviance occurs when a deviant 
event comes to the attention of signifi cant others or social 
control agents who apply a negative label. The newly labeled 
offender then reorganizes his or her behavior and personal-
ity around the consequences of the deviant act. The shoplift-
ing student is caught by a security guard and expelled from 
college. With his law school dreams dashed and his future 
cloudy, his options are limited; people who know him say 
he “lacks character,” and he begins to share their opinion. 
He eventually becomes a drug dealer and winds up in prison 
(Figure 7.6).
Secondary deviance involves resocialization into a devi-
ant role. The labeled person is transformed into one who,

effect on people who have been burdened with social and 
emotional problems since birth.210
While these criticisms are telling, criminologists Ray-
mond Paternoster and Leeann Iovanni have identified 
features of the labeling perspective that are important con-
tributions to the study of criminality:211
The labeling perspective identifi es the role played by social 
 
■
control agents in the process of crime causation. Criminal 
behavior cannot be fully understood if the agencies and in-
dividuals empowered to control and treat it are neglected.
Labeling theory recognizes that criminality is not a 
 
■
disease or pathological behavior. It focuses attention 
on the social interactions and reactions that shape indi-
viduals and their behavior.
Labeling theory distinguishes between criminal acts 
 
■
(primary deviance) and criminal careers (secondary 
deviance) and shows that these concepts must be inter-
preted and treated differently.
Labeling theory is also important because of its focus on 
interaction as well as the situations surrounding the crime. 
Rather than viewing the criminal as a robot-like creature 
whose actions are predetermined, it recognizes that crime 
is often the result of complex interactions and processes. 
The decision to commit crime involves actions of a variety 
of people, including peers, the victim, the police, and other 
key characters. Labels may expedite crime because they 
guide the actions of all parties involved in these criminal 
interactions. Actions deemed innocent when performed by 
one person are considered provocative when someone who 
has been labeled as deviant engages in them. Similarly, la-
beled people may be quick to judge, take offense, or misin-
terpret behavior of others because of past experience.
Labeling theory is also supported by research showing 
that convicted criminals who are placed in treatment pro-
grams aimed at reconfi guring their self-image may be able to 
develop revamped identities and desist from crime. Some are 
able to go through “redemption rituals” in which they are able 
to cast off their damaged identities and develop new ones. As 
a result, they develop an improved self-concept, which refl ects 
the positive reinforcement they receive while in treatment.212
EVALUATING SOCIAL 
PROCESS THEORIES
The branches of social process theory—social learning, social 
control, and social reaction—are compatible because they sug-
gest that criminal behavior is part of the socialization process. 
When interactions with critically important social institutions 
and processes—the family, schools, justice system, peer groups, 
employers, and neighbors—are troubled and disturbed, peo-
ple may turn to criminal solutions for their problems.
imposing harsher sentences on African Americans only in 
some instances, such as when they victimize whites and not 
other African Americans.200 They may also be more likely to 
impose prison sentences on racial minorities in “borderline” 
cases for which whites get probation. According to their view, 
racism is very subtle and hard to detect, but it still exerts an 
infl uence in the distribution of criminal sanctions.
Labeling Effects Considerable evidence indicates social 
sanctions lead to self-labeling and deviance amplifi cation.201 
Children negatively labeled by their parents routinely suffer a 
variety of problems, including antisocial behavior and school 
failure.202 This process has been observed in the United 
States and abroad, indicating that the labeling process is uni-
versal, especially in nations in which a brush with the law 
brings personal dishonor, such as China and Japan.203
Empirical evidence supports the view that labeling 
plays a signifi cant role in persistent offending.204 Although 
labels may not cause adolescents to initiate criminal behav-
iors, experienced criminals are signifi cantly more likely to 
continue offending if they believe their parents and peers 
view them in a negative light; they now have a “damaged 
identity.”205 Maintaining a damaged identity after offi cial 
labeling may, along with other negative social reactions 
from society, produce a “cumulative disadvantage,” which 
provokes some adolescents into repeating their antisocial 
behaviors.206 Using longitudinal data obtained from youths 
ages 13 to 22, Jön Gunnar Bernburg and Marvin Krohn 
found evidence that, rather than deterring future offending, 
the “cumulative disadvantage” created by offi cial interven-
tion actually increases the probability that a labeled person 
will get involved in subsequent antisocial behavior. A label 
triggers exclusionary processes that limit conventional op-
portunities, such as educational attainment and employ-
ment. Kids who were labeled in adolescence were much 
more likely to engage in crime in early adulthood unless 
they were able to overcome labels and do well in school 
and obtain meaningful employment opportunities.207
Is Labeling Theory Valid?
Labeling theory has been the subject of academic debate in 
criminological circles. Those who criticize it point to its in-
ability to specify the conditions that must exist before an act 
or individual is labeled deviant—that is, why some people 
are labeled and others remain “secret deviants.”208
There is also some question about the real cost of being 
labeled. In an in-depth analysis of research on the crime-
producing effects of labels, criminologist Charles Tittle 
found little evidence that stigma produces crime.209 Tittle 
claims that many criminal careers occur without labeling; 
that labeling often comes after, rather than before, chronic 
offending; and that criminal careers may not follow even 
when labeling takes place. Getting labeled by the justice sys-
tem and having an enduring criminal record may have little

CHAPTER 7 | Social Process Theories: Socialization and Society  255
Though there is some disagreement about the relative 
importance of those infl uences and the form they take, 
there seems to be little question that social interactions 
shape the behavior, beliefs, values, and self-image of the 
offender. People who have learned deviant social values, 
find themselves detached from conventional social re-
lationships, or are the subject of stigma and labels from 
significant others will be the most likely to fall prey to 
criminal behavior. These negative influences can affect 
people in all walks of life, beginning in their youth and 
continuing through their majority. The major strength 
of the social process view is the vast body of empirical 
data showing that delinquents and criminals are people 
who grew up in dysfunctional families, who had troubled 
childhoods, and who failed at school, at work, and in

SOCIAL LEARNING THEORIES
Differential association theory
People learn to commit crime 
from exposure to antisocial 
definitions.
Explains onset of criminality. Explains 
the presence of crime in all elements 
of social structure. Explains why some 
people in high-crime areas refrain 
from criminality. Can apply to adults 
and juveniles.
Measuring definitions 
toward crime; influence 
of deviant peers and 
parents.
Differential reinforcement theory
Criminal behavior depends 
on the person’s experiences 
with rewards for conventional 
behaviors and punishment for 
deviant ones. Being rewarded 
for deviance leads to crime.
Adds psychological learning theory 
principles to differential association. 
Links sociological and psychological 
principles.
The cause of criminal 
activity; how the 
content of socialization 
conditions crime.
Neutralization theory
Youths learn ways of 
neutralizing moral restraints 
and periodically drift in and out 
of criminal behavior patterns.
Explains why many delinquents do 
not become adult criminals. Explains 
why youthful law violators can 
participate in conventional behavior.
Identifying the 
neutralizations people 
use to commit crime 
without jeopardizing their 
cherished beliefs and 
values.
SOCIAL CONTROL THEORY
Hirschi’s control theory
A person’s bond to society 
prevents him or her from 
violating social rules. If the 
bond weakens, the person is 
free to commit crime.

marriage. Prison data show that these characteristics are 
typical of inmates.
Although persuasive, these theories do not always account 
for the patterns and fl uctuations in the crime rate. If social 
process theories are valid, for example, people in the West and 
South must be socialized differently from those in the Mid-
west and New England because these latter regions have much 
lower crime rates. How can the fact that crime rates are lower 
in October than in July be explained if crime is a function of 
learning or control? How can social processes explain why 
criminals escalate their activity or why they desist from crime 
as they age? Once a social bond is broken, how can it be “reat-
tached”? Once crime is “learned,” how can it be “unlearned”?

and research focus of social process theories.

furlough, and educational opportunity programs being de-
veloped in the nation’s prisons. These programs are designed 
to help inmates maintain a stake in society so they will be 
less willing to resort to criminal activity on their release.
Labeling theorists caution against too much interven-
tion. Rather than ask social agencies to attempt to rehabili-
tate people having problems with the law, they argue, “less is 
better.” Put another way, the more institutions try to “help” 
people, the more these people will be stigmatized and la-
beled. For example, a special education program designed 
to help problem readers may cause them to label themselves 
and others as slow or stupid. Similarly, a mental health re-
habilitation program created with the best intentions may 
cause clients to be labeled as crazy or dangerous.
 
The influence of labeling theory can be viewed 
in the development of diversion and restitution programs. 
Diversion programs are designed to remove both juvenile 
and adult offenders from the normal channels of the crimi-
nal justice process by placing them in programs designed 
for rehabilitation. A college student whose drunken driving 
causes injury to a pedestrian may, before a trial occurs, be 
placed for six months in an alcohol treatment program. If 
he successfully completes the program, charges against him 
will be dismissed. Thus, he avoids the stigma of a criminal 
label. Such programs are common throughout the nation. 
Often, they offer counseling, medical advice, and vocational, 
educational, and family services.
Another label-avoiding innovation that has gained pop-
ularity is restitution. Rather than face the stigma of a formal 
trial, an offender is asked to either pay back the victim of the 
crime for any loss incurred or do some useful work in the 
community in lieu of receiving a court-ordered sentence.
Despite their good intentions, stigma-reducing programs 
have not met with great success. Critics charge that they sub-
stitute one kind of stigma for another—for instance, attend-
ing a mental health program in place of a criminal trial. In 
addition, diversion and restitution programs usually screen 
out violent offenders and repeat offenders. Finally, there is 
little hard evidence that the recidivism rate of people placed 
in alternative programs is less than that of people sent to 
traditional programs.
PUBLIC POLICY 
IMPLICATIONS OF SOCIAL 
PROCESS THEORY
Social process theories have had a major infl uence on policy 
making since the 1950s. Learning theories have greatly infl u-
enced the way criminal offenders are dealt with and treated. 
The effect of these theories has mainly been felt by young 
offenders, who are viewed as being more salvageable than 
“hardened” criminals. If people become criminal by learning 
defi nitions and attitudes toward criminality, advocates of the 
social learning approach argue that they can “unlearn” them 
by being exposed to defi nitions toward conventional behav-
ior. It is common today for residential and nonresidential 
programs to offer treatment programs that teach offenders 
about the harmfulness of drugs, how to forgo delinquent 
behavior, and how to stay in school. If learning did not af-
fect behavior, such exercises would be futile.
Control theories have also infl uenced criminal justice and 
other public policy. Programs have been developed to increase 
people’s commitment to conventional lines of action. Some 
work at creating and strengthening bonds early in life before 
the onset of criminality. The educational system has been the 
scene of numerous programs designed to improve basic skills 
and create an atmosphere in which youths will develop a 
bond to their schools. The most famous of these efforts is the 
Head Start program. Today, Head Start is administered by the 
Head Start Bureau; the Administration on Children, Youth, 
and Families (ACFY); the Administration for Children and 
Families (ACF); and the Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS). It receives annual funding of almost $7 bil-
lion, enrolls close to 1 million children, and provides support 
to more than 1,600 individual programs.213
Control theories have focused on the family and have 
played a key role in putting into operation programs de-
signed to strengthen the bond between parent and child. 
Others attempt to repair bonds that have been broken and 
frayed. Examples of this approach are the career, work

tions, institutions, and processes 
in society. People in all walks of 
life have the potential to become 
criminals if they maintain destruc-
tive social relationships. Improper 
socialization is a key component 
of crime.
 2. Be able to discuss the differ-
ences between social learning, 
control, and reaction theory
Social learning theory stresses 
that people learn how to commit 
SUMMARY
crimes and suggests that people 
learn criminal behaviors much as 
they learn conventional behavior. 
Social control theory analyzes the 
failure of society to control crimi-
nal tendencies. Social reaction 
(labeling) theory maintains that 
negative labels produce criminal 
careers.

CHAPTER 7 | Social Process Theories: Socialization and Society  257
 3. Discuss the effect of families 
and education on crime
Kids growing up in troubled fami-
lies are crime prone. Parental ef-
fi cacy reduces crime. Divorce can 
strain families. School failure is 
linked to delinquency. Dropping 
out may infl uence later criminal-
ity. School violence and confl ict 
are also problems.
 4. Be aware of the link between 
peers and delinquency
Delinquent peers sustain individ-
ual offending patterns. Delinquent 
friends may help kids neutral-
ize the fear of punishment. The 
greater the exposure to delinquent 
peers, the greater the likelihood of 
criminal behavior.
 5. Be familiar with the association 
between beliefs and 
criminality
People with high moral standards 
can resist crime. Church at-
tendance is related to low crime 
rates: the more people attend 
religious services, the less likely 
they will engage in antisocial 
behaviors. 
 6. Discuss the main types of social 
learning theory
Differential association theory 
was formulated by Edwin 
Sutherland. It holds that crimi-
nality is a result of a person’s 
perceiving an excess of defi ni-
tions in favor of crime. Gresham 
Sykes and David Matza created 
the theory of neutralization, 
which stresses that youths 
learn mental techniques that 
enable them to overcome 
societal values and drift into 
delinquency. 
 7. Be familiar with the principles 
of control theory
Control theory maintains that 
all people have the potential 
to become criminals, but their 
bonds to conventional society 
prevent them from violating the 
law. This view suggests that a 
person’s self-concept aids his or 
her commitment to conventional 
action. Travis Hirschi’s social 
control theory describes the so-
cial bond as containing elements 
of attachment, commitment, in-
volvement, and belief. Weakened 
bonds allow youths to behave 
antisocially.
 8. Know the basic elements of 
social reaction or labeling 
theory
Social reaction or labeling 
theory holds that criminality is 
promoted by becoming negatively 
labeled by signifi cant others. 
Such labels as “criminal,” “ex-
con,” and “junkie” isolate people 
from society and lock them into 
lives of crime.
 9. Be aware of the effects of 
labeling
Labels create expectations that the 
labeled person will act in a certain 
way; labeled people are always 
watched and suspected. Eventu-
ally these people begin to accept 
their labels as personal identities, 
locking them further into lives 
of crime and deviance. Edwin 
Lemert suggests that people who 
accept labels are involved in sec-
ondary deviance while primary 
deviants are able to maintain an 
undamaged identity.
 10. Link social process theory to 
crime prevention efforts
Social process theories have 
greatly infl uenced social policy. 
They have been applied in treat-
ment orientations as well as com-
munity action policies. Some 
programs teach kids conventional 
attitudes and behaviors. Others 
are designed to improve the social 
bond they have with parents and 
teachers.

258  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
 1. Do negative labels cause crime? Or 
do people who commit crime be-
come negatively labeled? That is, are 
labels a cause of crime or a result?
 2. Once weakened, can a person’s 
bonds to society become reat-
tached? What social processes 
might help reattachment?
 3. Can you devise a test of Suther-
land’s differential association the-
ory? How would you go about 
measuring an excess of defi nitions 
toward criminality?
 4. Can you think of ways you may 
have supported your peers’ or 
siblings’ antisocial behavior by 
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
helping them learn criminal 
techniques or attitudes?
 5. Do you recall neutralizing any 
guilt you might have felt for com-
mitting a criminal or illegal act? 
Did your neutralizations come be-
fore or after you committed the 
act in question?

In June 2009, Amnesty International, the civil rights watchdog organization, published a report accusing the 
Sri Lankan government of a vicious cycle of civil rights abuse in its war against the Tamil Tiger rebel group. 
In addition, the Sri Lankan government was accused of failing to investigate civil rights violations, including 
disappearances and torture of political suspects, in their suppression of the Tamil independence movement. 
Even when the government formed Commissions of Inquiry to investigate disappearances and other human 
rights–related issues, Amnesty found that these commissions lacked credibility and actually delayed criminal 
investigations; very few prosecutions for human rights violations ever took place.
These allegations stemmed from the recently ended confl ict between government forces and the Tamil 
Tigers (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE), a group that sought to carve out an independent state for

Critical criminologists often take the broader view, op-
posing racism, sexism, and genocide, rather than focusing 
on burglary, robbery, and rape.4 They want to publicize the 
fact that while spending is being cut on social programs, it 
is being raised on military expansion. The rapid buildup of 
the prison system and passage of draconian criminal laws 
that threaten civil rights and liberties—the death penalty, 
three strikes laws—are other elements of the conservative 
agenda. Critical criminologists believe that they are respon-
sible for informing the public about the dangers of these 
developments.5
This chapter reviews the historical development of criti-
cal criminology. It covers its principle ideas, and then looks 
at policies that have been embraced by critical thinkers, 
which focus on peace and restoration rather than punish-
ment and exclusion. Figure 8.1 illustrates the various inde-
pendent branches of social confl ict theory.
THE HISTORICAL 
DEVELOPMENT OF 
CRITICAL CRIMINOLOGY
The roots of critical criminology can be traced to the so-
cial philosopher Karl Marx (1818–1883), who identifi ed the 
economic structures in society that control all human rela-
tions. Marx’s view of society was shaped by the economic 
trends and structures of that period. He lived in an era of 
unrestrained capitalist expansion.6 The tools of the Indus-
trial Revolution had become regular features of society by 
the Tamil people, an ethnic/religious minority group. The confl ict lasted more than 20 years, and enforced 
disappearances and extrajudicial executions reached vast proportions. But it was not just the rebels who were 
hunted and killed. There were more than 30,000 disappearances of people considered sympathetic to the 
Tamil cause, including businessmen, journalists, and individuals suspected of having terrorist links; even a 
vice chancellor of a university was a victim. Once they were taken into government hands, people suspected 
of aiding the rebels were often never seen again. In addition to this outrage, hundreds of thousands of 
innocent people were displaced from their homes.1
T
The civil rights violations and executions carried out in Sri 
Lanka are extreme examples of the social confl ict that domi-
nates and shapes contemporary society. We live in a world rife 
with political, social, and economic conflict in nearly every 
corner of the globe. Confl ict comes in many forms, occurs at 
many levels of society, and involves a whole slew of adversaries: 
workers and bosses, the United States and its overseas enemies, 
religious zealots and apostates, citizens and police. It occurs 
within cities, in neighborhoods, and even within the family.
Conflict can be destructive when it leads to war, vio-
lence, and death; it can be functional when it results in posi-
tive social change. Confl ict promotes crime by creating a 
social atmosphere in which the law is a mechanism for con-
trolling dissatisfi ed, have-not members of society while the 
wealthy maintain their power. This is why crimes that are 
the province of the wealthy, such as illegal corporate activi-
ties, are sanctioned much more leniently than those, such as 
burglary, that are considered lower-class activities.
Criminologists who view crime as a function of social 
confl ict and economic rivalry have in the past been known 
by a number of titles, such as confl ict, Marxist, left, or radi-
cal criminologists, but today most commonly they are re-
ferred to as critical criminologists and their fi eld of study 
as critical criminology.
Like their title hints, critical criminologists view them-
selves as social critics who dig beneath the surface of society 
to uncover its inequities. They reject the notion that law is 
designed to maintain a tranquil, fair society and that crimi-
nals are malevolent people who wish to trample the rights of 
others. They believe that the law is an instrument of power, 
wielded by those who control society in order to maintain 
their wealth, social position, and class advantage. They con-
sider acts of racism, sexism, imperialism, unsafe working con-
ditions, inadequate child care, substandard housing, pollution 
of the environment, and war-making as a tool of foreign policy 
to be “true crimes.” The crimes of the helpless—burglary, rob-
bery, and assault—are more expressions of rage over unjust 
economic conditions than actual crimes.2
Contemporary critical criminologists try to explain 
crime within economic and social contexts and to express 
the connection between social class, crime, and social con-
trol.3 They are concerned with issues such as these:

1850. Mechanized factories, the use of coal to drive steam 
engines, and modern transportation all inspired economic 
development. Production had shifted from cottage indus-
tries to large factories. Industrialists could hire workers on 
their own terms; as a result, conditions in factories were 
atrocious. Factory owners and the government enforcement 
agents in their pay ruthlessly suppressed trade unions that 
promised workers salvation from these atrocities.
Marx’s early career as a journalist was interrupted 
by government suppression of the newspaper where he 
worked, because of the paper’s liberal editorial policy. 
He then moved to Paris, where he met Friedrich Engels

(1820–1895), who would become his friend and economic 
patron. By 1847, Marx and Engels had joined with a group 
of primarily German socialist revolutionaries known as the 
Communist League.

268  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Marx believed societies and their structures were not 
stable and, therefore, could change through slow evolution 
or sudden violence. If social confl icts are not resolved, they 
tend to destabilize society, leading to social change.
The ebb and fl ow of the capitalist business cycle cre-
ates social confl icts that contain the seeds of its own de-
struction. Marx predicted that from its ashes would grow 
a socialist state in which the workers themselves would 
own the means of production. In his analysis, Marx used 
the dialectic method, based on the analysis developed 
of the working class, he believed, would eventually lead to 
class confl ict and the end of the capitalist system.
Marx focused his attention on the economic condi-
tions perpetuated by the capitalist system. He stated that 
its development had turned workers into a dehumanized 
mass who lived an existence that was at the mercy of their 
capitalist employers. He wrote of the injustice of young 
children being sent to work in mines and factories from 
dawn to dusk. He focused on the people who were being 
beaten down by a system that demanded obedience and 
cooperation and offered little in return. These oppressive 
conditions led Marx to conclude that the character of ev-
ery civilization is determined by its mode of production—
the way its people develop and produce material goods 
(materialism).
Marx identifi ed the economic structures in society that 
control all human relations. Production has two compo-
nents: productive forces, which include such things as 
technology, energy sources, and material resources, and 
productive relations, which are the relationships that ex-
ist among the people producing goods and services. The 
most important relationship in industrial culture is be-
tween the owners of the means of production, the capital-
ist bourgeoisie, and the people who do the actual labor, 
the proletariat.
Throughout history, society has been organized this 
way: master–slave, lord–serf, and now capitalist–proletariat. 
According to Marx, capitalist society is subject to the devel-
opment of a rigid class structure with the capitalist bour-
geoisie at the top, followed by the working proletariat, who 
actually produce goods and services, and at the bottom, 
the fringe, nonproductive members who produce nothing 
and live, parasitically, off the work of others—the lumpen 
 proletariat (Figure 8.2).
In Marxist theory, the term class does not refer to an 
attribute or characteristic of a person or a group; rather, it 
denotes position in relation to others. Thus, it is not nec-
essary to have a particular amount of wealth or prestige to 
be a member of the capitalist class; it is more important to 
have the power to exploit others economically, legally, and 
socially. The political and economic philosophy of the dom-
inant class infl uences all aspects of life. Consciously or un-
consciously, artists, writers, and teachers bend their work to 
the whims of the capitalist system. Thus, the economic sys-
tem controls all facets of human life. Consequently, people’s 
lives revolve around the means of production.
As Marx said:
In all forms of society, there is one specifi c kind of pro-
duction which predominates over the rest, whose rela-
tions thus assign rank and infl uence to the others. It is a 
general illumination which bathes all the other colours 
and modifi es their particularity. It is a particular ether 
which determines the specifi c gravity of every being 
which has materialized within it.7

CHAPTER 8 | Social Conflict, Critical Criminology, and Restorative Justice  269
by the philosopher Georg Hegel (1770–1831). Hegel ar-
gued that for every idea, or thesis, there exists an oppos-
ing argument, or antithesis. Since neither position can 
ever be truly accepted, the result is a merger of the two 
ideas, a synthesis. Marx adapted this analytic method for 
his study of class struggle. History, argued Marx, is replete 
with examples of two opposing forces whose confl ict pro-
motes social change. When conditions are bad enough, the 
oppressed will rise up to fi ght the owners and eventually 
replace them. Thus, in the end, the capitalist system will 
destroy itself.
A Marxist Vision of Crime
Marx did not write a great deal on the subject of crime, but 
he mentioned it in a variety of passages scattered through-
out his writing. He viewed crime as the product of law en-
forcement policies akin to a labeling process theory.8 He also 
saw a connection between criminality and the inequities 
found in the capitalist system. He reasoned: “There must be 
something rotten in the very core of a social system which 
increases in wealth without diminishing its misery, and in-
creases in crime even more rapidly than in numbers.”9
His collaborator, Friedrich Engels, however, did spend 
some time on the subject in his work, The Condition of the 
Working Class in England in 1844.10 Engels portrayed crime 
as a function of social demoralization—a collapse of peo-
ple’s humanity reflecting a decline in society. Workers, 
demoralized by capitalist society, are caught up in a pro-
cess that leads to crime and violence. According to Engels, 
workers are social outcasts, ignored by the structure of 
capitalist society and treated as brutes.11 Left to their own 
devices, working people commit crime because their choice 
is a slow death of starvation or a speedy one at the hands of 
the law. The brutality of the capitalist system, he believed, 
turns workers into animal-like creatures without a will of 
their own.
The writings of Karl Marx greatly influenced the de-
velopment of the view of crime that rested on the concept 
of social confl ict. Even though Marx himself did not write 
much on the topic of crime, his views on the relationship 
between the concept of social confl ict was fi rst applied to 
criminology by three distinguished scholars: Willem Bonger, 
Ralf Dahrendorf, and George Vold. In some instances, their 
works share the Marxist view that industrial society is 
wracked by confl ict between the proletariat and the bour-
geoisie; in other instances, their writings diverge from Marx-
ist dogma. The writing of each of these pioneers is briefl y 
described in Exhibit 8.1.

EXHIBIT 8.1
Willem Bonger, Ralf Dahrendorf, and George 
Vold on Crime
Willem Bonger
Bonger believed that society is divided into have and have-not 
groups, not on the basis of people’s innate ability, but 
because of the system of production that is in force. In every 
society that is divided into a ruling class and an inferior class, 
penal law serves the will of the ruling class. Even though 
criminal laws may appear to protect members of both 
classes, hardly any act is punished that does not injure the 
interests of the dominant ruling class. Crimes, then, are 
considered to be antisocial acts because they are harmful 
to those who have the power at their command to control 
society. Under capitalism, the legal system discriminates 
against the poor by defending the actions of the wealthy. 
Because the proletariat are deprived of the materials that 
are monopolized by the bourgeoisie, they are more likely to 
violate the law.
Ralf Dahrendorf
Dahrendorf argued that modern society is organized into 
what he called imperatively coordinated associations. 
These associations comprise two groups: those who possess 
authority and use it for social domination and those who 
lack authority and are dominated. Society is a plurality of 
competing interest groups. He proposed a unified conflict 
theory of human behavior, which can be summarized as 
follows:
Every society is at every point subject to processes of 
 
■
change; social change is everywhere.
Every society displays at every point dissent and conflict; 
 
■
social conflict is everywhere.
Every element in a society renders a contribution to its 
 
■
disintegration and change.
Every society is based on the coercion of some of its 
 
■
members by others.
George Vold
Vold argued that laws are created by politically oriented 
groups, who seek the government’s assistance to help them 
defend their rights and protect their interests. If a group can 
marshal enough support, a law will be created to hamper and 
curb the interests of some opposition group. Every stage of 
the process—from passing the law to prosecuting the case to 
developing relationships between inmate and guard, parole 
agent and parolee—is marked by conflict. Criminal acts are a 
consequence of direct contact between forces struggling to 
control society.

laws that benefi t themselves and keep rivals in check. Law 
is not an abstract body of rules that represents an absolute 
moral code; rather, law is an integral part of society, a force 
that represents a way of life and a method of doing things. 
Crime is a function of power relations and an inevitable re-
sult of social confl ict. Criminals are not simply social misfi ts 
but people who have come up short in the struggle for suc-
cess and are seeking alternative means of achieving wealth, 
status, or even survival.
As a group, these social thinkers began to show how in 
our postindustrial, capitalist society the economic system in-
variably produces haves and have-nots.16 The mode of pro-
duction shapes social life. Because economic competitiveness 
is the essence of capitalism, confl ict increases and eventually 
destabilizes both social institutions and social groups.17
Contemporary Critical Criminology
From these early roots, a robust critical criminology was formed. 
At fi rst, these alternative forms of criminology were considered 
Marxist and radical. They have morphed into a critical crimi-
nology that is antiestablishment and questioning of the socio-
economic structures that produce crime and criminality.18
Today, critical criminologists devote their attention to a 
number of important themes and concepts. One is the use 
and misuse of power, or the ability of persons and groups to 
determine and control the behavior of others and to shape 
public opinion to meet their personal interests. Because 
those in power shape the content of the law, it comes as no 
surprise that their behavior is often exempt from legal sanc-
tions. Those who deserve the most severe sanctions (wealthy 
white-collar criminals whose crimes cost society millions of 
dollars) usually receive lenient punishments, while those 
whose relatively minor crimes are committed out of eco-
nomic necessity (petty thieves and drug dealers) receive 
stricter penalties, especially if they are minority group mem-
bers who lack social and economic power.19
Critical criminologists also critique the fi eld of criminol-
ogy, questioning the role criminologists play in supporting 
the status quo and aiding in the oppression of the poor and 
powerless.20 After all, criminologists may spend their time 
creating effective crime control mechanisms that swell the 
nation’s prisons with indigent and desperate people while 
corporate executives make fat profi ts.
Critical criminologists have also been deeply concerned 
about the current state of the American political system and 
the creation of what they consider to be an American empire 
abroad. Ironically, recent events such as the war in Iraq and 
the efforts to penalize immigrants and close U.S. borders have 
energized critical thinkers; their vision seems as pertinent to-
day as it was during its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s.21 
The conservative agenda, they believe, calls for the disman-
tling of welfare and health programs, lowering of labor costs 
through union busting, tax cuts that favor the wealthy, ending 
affi rmative action, and reducing environmental control and 
CREATING A CRITICAL 
CRIMINOLOGY
The social ferment of the 1960s gave birth to critical crimi-
nology. In 1968, a group of British sociologists formed the 
National Deviancy Conference (NDC). With about 300 
members, this organization sponsored several national sym-
posia and dialogues. Members came from all walks of life, 
but at its core the NDC was a group of academics who were 
critical of the positivist criminology being taught in British 
and American universities. More specifi cally, they rejected 
the conservative stance of criminologists and their close fi -
nancial relationship with government funding agencies.
The NDC called attention to ways in which social con-
trol might actually cause deviance rather than just respond 
to antisocial behavior. Many conference members became 
concerned about the political nature of social control.
In 1973, critical theory was given a powerful academic 
boost when British scholars Ian Taylor, Paul Walton, and 
Jock Young published The New Criminology.12 This brilliant, 
thorough, and well-constructed critique of existing concepts 
in criminology called for the development of new methods 
of criminological analysis and critique. The New Criminology 
became the standard resource for scholars critical of both the 
fi eld of criminology and the existing legal process. Since its 
publication there has been a tradition for critical criminolo-
gists to turn their attention to the fi eld itself, questioning the 
role criminology plays in supporting the status quo and aid-
ing in the oppression of the poor and powerless.13
U.S. scholars were also infl uenced during the late 1960s 
and early 1970s by the widespread unrest and social change 
that shook the world. The war in Vietnam, prison struggles, 
and the civil rights and feminist movements produced a cli-
mate in which criticism of the ruling class seemed a natural 
by-product. Mainstream, positivist criminology was criti-
cized as being overtly conservative, pro-government, and 
antihuman. Critical criminologists scoffed when their fellow 
scholars used statistical analysis of computerized data to de-
scribe criminal and delinquent behavior. Several infl uential 
scholars embraced the idea that the social confl ict produced 
by the unequal distribution of power and wealth was at the 
root cause of crime. William Chambliss and Robert Seidman 
wrote the well-respected treatise Law, Order and Power, 
which documented how the justice system protects the rich 
and powerful.14 Chambliss and Seidman’s work showed 
how control of the political and economic system affects the 
way criminal justice is administered and that the defi nitions 
of crime used in contemporary society favor those who con-
trol the justice system.
In another infl uential work, The Social Reality of Crime, 
Richard Quinney also proclaimed that in contemporary so-
ciety criminal law represents the interests of those who hold 
power.15 Where there is confl ict between social groups—the 
wealthy and the poor—those who hold power will create

Robert Bohm, is to make the public aware that these be-
haviors “are crimes just as much as burglary and robbery.”25
Take for instance what Alette Smeulers and Roelof Haveman 
call supranational crimes: war crimes, crimes against hu-
manity, genocide, and other human rights violations. Smeul-
ers and Haveman believe that these types of crimes should 
merit more attention by criminologists, and therefore they 
call for a separate specialization.26
The nature of a society controls the direction of its criminal-
ity; criminals are not social misfi ts but products of the society 
and its economic system.27 According to Michael Lynch and 
W. Byron Groves, three implications follow from this view:
 1. Each society produces its own types and amounts of 
crime.
 2. Each society has its own distinctive ways of dealing with 
criminal behavior.
 3. Each society gets the amount and type of crime that it 
deserves.28
This analysis tells us that criminals are not a group of out-
siders who can be controlled by increased law enforcement. 
Criminality, instead, is a function of social and economic or-
ganization. To control crime and reduce criminality, societ-
ies must remove the social conditions that promote crime.
In our advanced technological society, those with eco-
nomic and political power control the defi nition of crime 
and the manner in which the criminal justice system en-
forces the law.29 Consequently, the only crimes available to 
the poor are the severely sanctioned “street crimes”: rape, 
murder, theft, and mugging. Members of the middle class 
cheat on their taxes and engage in petty corporate crime 
(employee theft), acts that generate social disapproval but 
are rarely punished severely. The wealthy are involved in 
acts that should be described as crimes but are not, such as 
racism, sexism, and profi teering. Although regulatory laws 
control illegal business activities, these are rarely enforced, 
and violations are lightly punished. One reason is that an 
essential feature of capitalism is the need to expand business 
and create new markets. This goal often confl icts with laws 
designed to protect the environment and creates clashes 
with those who seek their enforcement. In our postindus-
trial society, the need for expansion usually triumphs. For 
example, corporate spokespeople and their political allies 
will brand environmentalists as “tree huggers” who stand in 
the way of jobs and prosperity.30
The rich are insulated from street crimes because they 
live in areas far removed from crime. Those in power use 
the fear of crime as a tool to maintain their control over so-
ciety. The poor are controlled through incarceration, and 
the middle class is diverted from caring about the crimes of 
the powerful by their fear of the crimes of the powerless.31
Ironically, they may have more to lose from the economic 
crimes committed by the rich than from the street crimes of 
the poor. Stock market swindles and savings and loan scams 
cost the public billions of dollars but are typically settled 
with fi nes and probationary sentences.
regulation. Some try to show how racism still pervades the 
American system and manifests itself in a wide variety of so-
cial practices ranging from the administration of criminal jus-
tice to the “whitening” of the teaching force because selection 
rests upon a racially skewed selection process.22
Because corporations are now more powerful than ever, 
at the expense of government, spending is being cut on so-
cial programs and increased on military expansion. The 
rapid buildup of the prison system and passage of draconian 
criminal laws that threaten civil rights and liberties—the war 
on drugs, the death penalty, “three strikes laws,” and the Pa-
triot Act—are other elements of the conservative agenda. Tax 
cuts for the wealthy mean less money for social programs. 
The war on drugs has resulted in millions of people being 
incarcerated, most of whom are poor and powerless. Critical 
criminologists believe they are responsible for informing the 
public about the dangers of these developments.23
The USA Patriot Act will be discussed further in Chap-
ter 11 within the context of legal efforts to thwart ter-
rorism. While some welcome its provisions that make it 
easier for the government to monitor people considered 
dangerous, critical thinkers fear loss of individual free-
dom at the expense of state power.
CONNECTIONS
Critical criminologists have turned their attention to the 
threat competitive capitalism presents to the working class. 
In addition to perpetuating male supremacy and racism, they 
believe that modern global capitalism helps destroy the lives 
of workers in less developed countries. Capitalists hailed 
China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 as a 
signifi cant economic event. However, critical thinkers point 
out that the economic boom has signifi cant costs: the aver-
age manufacturing wage in China is 20 to 25 cents per hour; 
many thousands of workers are killed at work each year and 
millions more disabled.24
HOW CRITICAL 
CRIMINOLOGISTS 
DEFINE CRIME
According to critical theorists, crime is a political concept 
designed to protect the power and position of the upper 
classes at the expense of the poor. Some, but not all, would 
include in a list of “real” crimes such acts as violations of 
human rights due to racism, sexism, and imperialism and 
other violations of human dignity and physical needs and 
necessities. Part of the critical agenda, argues criminologist

forced into service jobs at minimum wage. Many become 
temporary employees without benefi ts or a secure position.
As more people are thrust outside the economic main-
stream, a condition referred to as marginalization, a larger 
portion of the population is forced to live in areas conducive to 
crime. Once people are marginalized, commitment to the sys-
tem declines, producing another criminogenic force: a weak-
ened bond to society.32 This process is illustrated in Figure 8.3.
The government may be quick to respond during periods 
of economic decline because those in power assume that poor 
economic conditions breed crime and social disorder. When 
unemployment is increasing, public officials assume the 
worst and devote greater attention to the criminal justice sys-
tem, perhaps building new prisons to prepare for the coming 
“crime wave.”33 Empirical research confi rms that economic 
downturns are indeed linked to both crime rate increases and 
government activities such as passing anticrime legislation.34 
As the level of surplus value increases, so too do police ex-
penditures, most likely because of the perceived or real need 
for the state to control those on the economic margin.35
The theory of surplus value can be quite complex.

Globalization
The new global economy is a particularly vexing develop-
ment for critical theorists and their use of the concept of 
surplus value. Globalization, which usually refers to the 
process of creating transnational markets and political and 
Because private ownership of property is the true mea-
sure of success in American society (as opposed to, say, 
being a worthy person), the state becomes an ally of the 
wealthy in protecting their property interests. As a result, 
theft-related crimes are often punished more severely than 
are acts of violence because although the former may be in-
terclass, the latter are typically intraclass.
HOW CRITICAL 
CRIMINOLOGISTS VIEW 
THE CAUSE OF CRIME
Critical thinkers believe that the key crime-producing ele-
ment of modern corporate capitalism is the effort to create 
surplus value—the profi ts produced by the laboring classes 
that are accrued by business owners. Once accumulated, 
surplus value can be either reinvested or used to enrich the 
owners. To increase the rate of surplus value, workers can 
be made to toil harder for less pay, be made more effi cient, 
or be replaced by machines or technology. Therefore, eco-
nomic growth does not benefi t all elements of the popula-
tion, and in the long run it may produce the same effect as a 
depression or recession.
As the rate of surplus value increases, more people are 
displaced from productive relationships and the size of the 
marginal population swells. As corporations downsize to 
increase profi ts, high-paying labor and managerial jobs are 
lost to computer-driven machinery. Displaced workers are

Globalization may be responsible for the recent unrest 
in the fi nancial systems and in so doing has created a fertile 
ground for contemporary enterprise crimes. By expanding 
the reach of both criminal and noncriminal organizations, 
globalization also increases the vulnerability of indigenous 
people with a traditional way of life.38 With money and 
power to spare, criminal enterprise groups can recruit new 
members, bribe government offi cials, and even fund private 
armies. International organized crime has globalized its ac-
tivities for the same reasons legitimate multinational cor-
porations have expanded around the world: new markets 
bring new sources of profi ts. As international crime expert 
Louise Shelley puts it:
Just as multinational corporations establish branches 
around the world to take advantage of attractive labor 
or raw material markets, so do illicit businesses. Fur-
thermore, international businesses, both legitimate and 
illicit, also establish facilities worldwide for production, 
marketing, and distribution needs. Illicit enterprises are 
able to expand geographically to take advantage of these 
new economic circumstances thanks to the communica-
tions and international transportation revolution.39
legal systems, has shifted the focus of 
critical inquiry to a world perspective.
Globalization began when large com-
panies decided to establish themselves in 
foreign markets by adapting their prod-
ucts or services to the local culture. The 
process took off with the fall of the So-
viet Union, which opened new European 
markets. The development of China into 
a super industrial power encouraged 
foreign investors to take advantage of 
China’s huge supply of workers. As the 
Internet and communication revolution 
unfolded, companies were able to estab-
lish instant communications with their 
far-fl ung corporate empires, a technologi-
cal breakthrough that further aided trade 
and foreign investments. A series of trans-
national corporate mergers and takeovers 
(such as when Ford bought Swedish car 
maker Volvo in 1999 and then in 2010 
sold Volvo to the Chinese car company 
Geely) produced ever-larger transnational 
corporations.
Some experts believe globalization 
can improve the standard of living in 
third-world nations by providing jobs 
and training, but critical theorists question the altruism of 
multinational corporations. Their motives are exploiting 
natural resources, avoiding regulation, and taking advantage 
of desperate workers. When these giant corporations set up 
a factory in a developing nation, it is not to help the local 
population but to get around environmental laws and take 
advantage of needy workers who may be forced to labor in 
substandard conditions. In some instances, transnational 
companies take advantage of national unrest and calamity in 
order to engage in profi teering. For example, recent exami-
nations of illegal mineral expropriation in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DRC) highlight the role that trans-
national corporations and international marketplaces played 
in the theft of Congolese gold. While these companies did 
not directly encourage the confl ict or the massive human 
rights violations and crimes against humanity committed in 
the region, they were simply taking advantage of existing 
disorder and violence in order to make a huge profi t.36
Globalization has replaced imperialism and colonization 
as a new form of economic domination and oppression and 
now presents, according to critical thinkers, a threat to the 
world economy:

Globalization has changed the traditional ways of doing business, creating prosperity in 
some nations and chaos in others. People are now moving from nation to nation seeking 
jobs and a fresh start. Here, supporters of immigration reform rally for immigrants’ rights at 
the state capitol in Salem, Oregon, on April 9, 2006. Several thousand people gathered to 
support expanding immigrants’ rights and to protest congressional bill HR 4437, which was 
designed to tighten U.S. immigration. The sign reads, “We are not criminals.” Should 
immigration policies be tightened to protect American jobs, or should immigrants be allowed 
to enter the United States in order to take part in the “American Dream”?

controls. Globalization has allowed both individual offend-
ers and criminal gangs to gain tremendous operational ben-
efi ts while reducing risks of apprehension and punishment.
Globalization may have a profound influence on the 
concept of surplus value. Workers in the United States may 
be replaced in high-paying manufacturing jobs not by ma-
chines but by foreign workers. Instant communication via 
the Internet and global communications, a development 
that Marx could not have foreseen, will speed the effect im-
measurably. Globalization will have a profound effect both 
on the economy and eventually on crime rates.
State (Organized) Crime
While mainstream criminologists focus on the crimes of the 
poor and powerless, critical criminologists focus their atten-
tion on the law violations of the powerful. One area of con-
cern is referred to as state (organized) crime—acts defi ned 
Shelley argues that two elements of globalization en-
courage criminality: one technological, the other cultural. 
Technological advances such as efficient and widespread 
commercial airline traffi c, improvements in telecommunica-
tions (ranging from global cell phone connectivity to the In-
ternet), and the growth of international trade have all aided 
the growth in illicit transnational activities. These changes 
have facilitated the cross-border movement of goods and 
people, conditions exploited by criminals who now use 
Internet chat rooms to plan their activities. On a cultural 
level, globalization brings with it an ideology of free mar-
kets and free trade. The cultural shift means less interven-
tion and regulation, conditions exploited by crime groups 
to cross unpatrolled borders and to expand their activities 
to new regions of the world. Transnational crime groups 
freely exploit this new freedom to travel to regions where 
they cannot be extradited, base their operations in countries 
with ineffective or corrupt law enforcement, and launder 
their money in countries with bank secrecy or few effective 
and gases and atomic weapons.” Although 
the U.S. was never directly threatened or 
provoked by Iraq, President Bush declared 
war allegedly to “disarm Iraq . . . and to 
defend the world from grave danger.” The 
Bush administration’s propaganda cam-
paign was so successful that 70 percent of 
the U.S. public believed Iraq was directly 
involved in the attacks of 9/11 when the 
U.S.-led invasion of Iraq began.
According to Bonn, the cost of Bush’s 
deception was high. Iraq has been em-
broiled in a civil war, more than 4,000 U.S. 
soldiers and more than 1 million Iraqis 
(3.7 percent of the population) have been 
killed, and the war has cost the American 
taxpayer $10 billion per month.
Bonn believes that the war in Iraq 
amounts to state organized crime. It was 
precipitated by the Bush administration 
and reinforced by the news media, which 
exploited preexisting negative stereotypes 
of Arabs. The Bush administration perpe-
trated state crimes and war crimes as well 
as violations of international criminal law 
when they invaded Iraq. What was the real 
cause of the war? While the truth may never 
be known, one possibility is the unfinished 
Bush family business with Saddam Hussein 
resulting from the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
Another motivation was the Bush adminis-
tration’s desire to control Iraq’s oil produc-
tion and massive oil reserves.
Bonn critiques the war and the occupa-
tion of Iraq as violations of both U.S. and 
international laws. He believes that despite 
what amounted to committing war crimes, 
the Bush administration enjoyed both po-
litical and bureaucratic exemptions from 
prosecution under international law; it is 
unlikely to ever be held accountable for its 
actions. Bonn introduces a unique, inte-
grated, and interdisciplinary theory called 
“critical communication” to explain how 
and why political elites and the news media 
periodically create public panics that ben-
efit both parties.
CRITICAL THINKING
Is it fair to brand the war in Iraq as state 
organized crime? Does Bonn have it right, 
or were Bush’s motives more genuine: to 
protect the Iraqi people and the world from 
an evil dictator’s ambitions?
SOURCE: Scott A. Bonn, Mass Deception: Moral 
Panic and the U.S. War on Iraq (Piscataway, NJ: 
Rutgers University Press, 2010).
Mass Deception
In his recent (2010) book, Mass Deception,
criminologist Scott Bonn argues that the 
George W. Bush administration manufac-
tured public support for war with Iraq by 
falsely claiming that its leader, Saddam Hus-
sein, was involved in the terrorist attacks of 
9/11 and that Iraq possessed weapons of 
mass destruction. Bonn explains that the 
war was a function of a “moral panic” engi-
neered by the Bush administration with the 
support of the U.S. news media. A moral 
panic occurs when the general population 
begins to feel threatened by a person or 
group even though there may be little actual 
evidence to support the intensity of feeling 
expressed by the population. Bonn believes 
that despite overwhelming evidence that 
the attacks had been solely orchestrated 
by Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda, the 
Bush administration initiated a campaign 
to link 9/11 to Iraq, Saddam Hussein, and 
his Ba’ath Party. They convinced the U.S. 
public and the world that Iraq (a) was in-
volved in the attacks of 9/11, (b) possessed 
weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and 
(c) represented a grave and growing threat 
to U.S. security. In 2002, President Bush 
proclaimed that “the Iraqi dictator must not 
be permitted to threaten America and the 
world with horrible poisons and diseases

CHAPTER 8 | Social Conflict, Critical Criminology, and Restorative Justice  275
Another state crime involves the operation of the cor-
rectional systems in nations that are notorious for depriv-
ing detainees of basic necessities and routinely using hard 
labor and torture to punish political dissidents. The CIA has 
made use of their brutal regimes to soften up terror suspects 
for interrogation and sent suspected terror suspects to se-
cret prisons abroad, without trial or indictment. There they 
can be subject to harsh interrogation tactics forbidden in the 
United States.44
Other human rights violations are directed against mi-
grant laborers. For example, thousands of South Asian 
migrant workers are now working on a $27 billion island 
development in the United Arab Emirates. According to the 
Human Rights Watch, to obtain the visas needed to work in 
the UAE, nearly all workers paid hefty fees to “labor-supply 
agencies”; many workers sold their homes or land or bor-
rowed money at high rates of interest to pay the agencies’ 
fees. Upon arrival in the UAE, the indebted workers—many 
of whom are illiterate—were required to sign contracts with 
the construction companies on much worse terms than they 
had been promised back home, ensuring that their debts 
can never be paid off. In the worst cases, they are subjected 
to what may be considered forced labor or virtual slavery.45
State-Corporate Crime This type of state crime is commit-
ted by individuals who abuse their state authority or who fail 
to exercise it when working with people and organizations in 
the private sector. For example, a state environmental agency 
may fail to enforce laws, resulting in the pollution of pub-
lic waterways. State-corporate crime is particularly alarming, 
considering that regulatory law aimed at controlling private 
corporations is being scaled back while globalization has 
made corporations worldwide entities both in production 
and in advancing the consumption of their products.46
State Violence Sometimes nations engage in violence to 
maintain their power over dissident groups. Army or police 
offi cers form death squads—armed vigilante groups that kill 
suspected political opponents or other undesirables. These 
groups commit assassinations and kidnappings using ex-
tremely violent methods to intimidate the population and 
deter political activity against the government. For example, 
on January 24, 2009, Manoel Mattos, human rights activ-
ist and vice-president of the workers’ party in the state of 
Pernambuco, Brazil was shot in his own home by intrud-
ers. Mattos had received repeated death threats as a result of 
his work denouncing killings and abuses by death-squads 
across north-east Brazil. Despite the threats, federal police 
had recently withdrawn the protection he was receiving, al-
legedly because they felt it was no longer necessary.47
While the use of death squads is common in third-
world countries, police violence and use of deadly force 
are not uncommon in Western industrialized nations. In 
some nations, such as during the civil war in the Russian 
province of Chechnya, almost all political detainees are 
subjected to torture, including electric shocks, burnings, 
and severe beating with boots, sticks, plastic bottles fi lled 
by law as criminal and committed by state offi cials, both 
elected or appointed, in pursuit of their jobs as government 
representatives. Their actions, or in some cases failure to act, 
amount to a violation of the criminal law they are bound by 
oath or duty to uphold.
Among the most controversial claims made by critical 
criminologists are those linking the United States to state 
crime and violence. The Criminological Enterprise feature 
reviews a new book that makes just such a claim.
Those who study state crime argue that these antisocial 
behaviors arise from efforts to either maintain governmental 
power or to uphold the race, class, and gender advantages 
of those who support the government. In industrial society, 
the state will do everything to protect the property rights of 
the wealthy while opposing the real interests of the poor. 
They might even go to war to support the capitalist classes 
who need the wealth and resources of other nations. The de-
sire for natural resources such as rubber, oil, and metals was 
one of the primary reasons for Japan’s invasion of China and 
other Eastern nations that sparked their entry into World 
War II. Fifty years later, the U.S. was accused by many me-
dia commentators and political pundits of invading Iraq in 
order to secure its oil for American use.40
There are a number of categories of state crime and these 
are set out in some detail below.41
Illegal Domestic Surveillance This occurs when govern-
ment agents listen in on telephone conversations or intercept 
e-mails without proper approval in order to stifl e dissent and 
monitor political opponents. Sometimes the true purpose of 
the surveillance is masked by the need for national security 
while in reality it is illegal organizational policy and practice 
that has in some cases been sanctioned by heads of state for 
political purposes. The dangers of illegal surveillance have 
become magnifi ed because closed-circuit TV cameras are 
now routinely used by metropolitan police agencies. Many 
cities, including Washington, New York, Chicago, and Los 
Angeles, have installed signifi cant numbers of police-op-
erated cameras trained on public spaces. While ostensibly 
used to deter crime, once these surveillance facilities are put 
in place, police departments can use them to record the faces 
of political demonstrators, to record what people are read-
ing, and to store their photographs on computer databases 
without knowledge or permission. This capability worries 
both civil libertarians as well as critical criminologists.42
Human Rights Violations Some governments, such as 
Iran, routinely deny their citizens basic civil rights, hold-
ing them without trial and using “disappearances” and sum-
mary executions to rid themselves of political dissidents. 
After students rioted against governmental controls in 1999, 
more than 70 simply disappeared, another 1,200 to 1,400 
were detained, and dozens were killed when security forces 
broke up demonstrations.43 Similar violent actions to break 
up demonstrations took place in June 2009 in the wake of 
the disputed election that returned President Mahmoud Ah-
madinejad to power.

276  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Instrumental Theory
According to the instrumental view, the law and justice sys-
tem serve the powerful and rich and enable them to impose 
their morality and standards of behavior on the entire so-
ciety. Those who wield economic power are able to extend 
their self-serving defi nition of illegal or criminal behavior 
to encompass those who might threaten the status quo or 
interfere with their quest for ever-increasing profi ts.49 The 
concentration of economic assets in the nation’s largest in-
dustrial fi rms translates into the political power needed to 
control tax laws to limit the firms’ tax liabilities.50 Some 
have the economic clout to hire top attorneys to defend 
them against antitrust actions, making them almost immune 
to regulation.
The poor, according to this branch of critical theory, 
may or may not commit more crimes than the rich, but they 
certainly are arrested and punished more often. Under the 
capitalist system, the poor are driven to crime because a nat-
ural frustration exists in a society in which affl uence is well 
publicized but unattainable. When class confl ict becomes 
unbearable, frustration can spill out in riots, such as the one 
that occurred in Los Angeles on April 29, 1992, which was 
with water or sand, and heavy rubber-coated cables. The 
rest are subject to psychological pressure, such as threats 
or imitation of sexual abuse or execution, as well as threats 
to harm their relatives.48 The Profi les in Crime box focuses 
on this abuse.
INSTRUMENTAL VS. 
STRUCTURAL THEORY
Not all critical thinkers share a similar view of society and its 
control by the means of production. Instrumental theorists
view criminal law and the criminal justice system solely as 
instruments for controlling the poor, have-not members of 
society. They view the state as the tool of capitalists. In con-
trast, structural theorists believe that the law is not the ex-
clusive domain of the rich; rather, it is used to maintain the 
long-term interests of the capitalist system and to control 
members of any class who threaten its existence.

suicide bombers, death squad commandos 
tortured her to gain information and then 
shot her to death. One of the death squad 
members told reporters, “We disposed of 
her body in a field. We placed an artillery 
shell between her legs and one over her 
chest, added several 200-gram TNT blocks 
and blew her to smithereens. The trick is 
to make sure absolutely nothing is left. No 
body, no proof, no problem.” The technique 
was known as pulverization. The young re-
cruits she was training were taken away by 
another unit for further interrogation before 
they, too, were executed. Not only were sus-
pected rebels victimized, but also people 
close to them were systematically tracked, 
abducted, tortured, and killed. Intelligence 
was often extracted by breaking limbs with 
a hammer, administering electric shocks, 
and forcing men to perform sexual acts on 
each other. The bodies were either buried 
in unmarked pits or pulverized. The scenes 
would occasionally be filmed and circulated 
among enemy combatants as a form of psy-
chological warfare.
The Russian government publicly con-
demned torture and extrajudicial killing and 
denied that its army committed war crimes 
in Chechnya. Despite government protesta-
tions, the truth seems to be different. Far 
from being the work of a few ruthless mav-
ericks, these methods were widely used by 
death squads among the special forces.

Russia’s Death Squads
Russia’s two wars against breakaway prov-
ince Chechnya went on from the mid-1990s 
until 2009, when with massive firepower 
they crushed the separatist rebel groups; 
hundreds of thousands died during the 
conflict. As the war raged, Chechen fighters 
launched suicide attacks against civilians in 
the Moscow metro and at a rock festival. In 
2002, a gang that included 18 female sui-
cide bombers seized more than 800 hos-
tages in a Moscow theatre, 129 of whom 
died when the Russians pumped poison-
ous gas into the building on day three of 
the siege. In 2004, rebels took hundreds of

described as a “class rebellion of the underprivileged against 
the privileged.”51 Because of class confl ict, a deep-rooted 
hostility is generated among members of the lower class to-
ward a social order they are not allowed to shape and whose 
benefi ts are unobtainable.52
Instrumental theorists consider it essential to demystify
law and justice—that is, to unmask its true purpose. Crimi-
nological theories that focus on family structure, intelligence, 
peer relations, and school performance keep the lower classes 
servile by showing why they are more criminal, less intelli-
gent, and more prone to school failure and family problems 
than the middle class. Demystifi cation involves identifying 
the destructive intent of capitalist inspired and funded crimi-
nology. Instrumental theory’s goal for criminology is to show 
how capitalist law preserves ruling-class power.53
Structural Theory
Structural theorists disagree with the view that the relation-
ship between law and capitalism is unidirectional, always 
working for the rich and against the poor.54 If law and jus-
tice were purely instruments of the wealthy, why would 
laws controlling corporate crimes, such as price-fi xing, false 
advertising, and illegal restraint of trade, have been created 
and enforced?
To a structuralist, the law is designed to keep the system 
operating effi ciently, and anyone, worker or owner, who rocks 
the boat is targeted for sanction. For example, antitrust legis-
lation is designed to prevent any single capitalist from domi-
nating the system. If the free enterprise system is to function, 
no single person can become too powerful at the expense of 
the economic system as a whole. Structuralists would regard 
the efforts of the U.S. government to break up Microsoft as an 
example of a conservative government using its clout to keep 
the system on an even keel. The long prison sentences given 
to corporate executives who engage in insider trading are a 
warning to capitalists that they must play by the rules.
RESEARCH ON CRITICAL 
CRIMINOLOGY
Critical criminologists rarely use standard social science 
methodologies to test their views because many believe 
the traditional approach of measuring research subjects is 
antihuman and insensitive.55 Critical thinkers believe that 
the research conducted by mainstream liberal and positivist 
criminologists is often designed to unmask weak, powerless 
members of society so they can be better dealt with by the 
legal system. They are particularly offended by purely em-
pirical studies, such as those designed to show that minority 
group members have lower IQs than whites or that the in-
ner city is the site of the most serious crime whereas mid-
dle-class areas are relatively crime free. Critical scholars are 
more likely to examine historical trends and patterns than 
to do surveys and crunch numbers. For example, to exam-
ine the changes in criminal law, historian Michael Rusti-
gan analyzed historical records to show that law reform in 
nineteenth-century England was largely a response to pres-
sure from the business community to increase punishment 
for property law violations to protect their rapidly increas-
ing wealth.56 Other research has focused on topics such as 
how the relationship between convict work and capitalism 
evolved during the nineteenth century. During this period, 
prisons became a profi table method of centralized state con-
trol over lower-class criminals, whose labor was exploited 
by commercial concerns. These criminals were forced to la-
bor to pay off wardens and correctional administrators.57
Empirical research, however, is not considered totally 
incompatible with critical criminology, and there have been 
some important efforts to test its fundamental assumptions. 
One area of critical research involves examining the criminal 
justice system to see if it operates as an instrument of class 
oppression or as a fair, even-handed social control agency. 
Research has found that jurisdictions with signifi cant levels 
of economic disparity are also the most likely to have large 
numbers of people killed by police offi cers. Police may act 
more forcefully in areas where class confl ict creates the per-
ception that extreme forms of social control are needed to 
maintain order.58
The enforcement of laws against illegal business activi-
ties such as price fi xing, restraint of trade, environmental 
crimes, and false advertising is discussed in Chapter 12. 
Although some people are sent to prison for these white-
collar offenses, many offenders are still punished with a 
fi ne or economic sanction.
CONNECTIONS
Empirical research also shows, as predicted by critical 
theory, that a suspect’s race is an important factor in shaping 
justice system decision making. Using data from a national 
survey, Ronald Weitzer and Steven Tuch found that about 
40 percent of African American respondents claimed they 
were stopped by police because of their race, as compared 
to just 5 percent of whites; almost 75 percent of young Afri-
can American men, ages 18 to 34, said they were victims of 
profi ling.59 Recent research by Albert Meehan and Michael 
Ponder found that police are more likely to use racial pro-
fi ling to stop black motorists as they travel further into the 
boundaries of predominantly white neighborhoods: black 
motorists driving in an all-white neighborhood set up a red 
fl ag because they are “out of place.”60 It is not surprising to 
critical theorists that police brutality complaints are highest

278  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Faulkner was able to draw his gun and 
fire one return shot that struck Abu-Jamal 
in the upper abdomen. Having fired this 
shot, Officer Faulkner fell to the sidewalk. 
While Faulkner lay helpless, Abu-Jamal ap-
proached him and shot him numerous times 
at close range, killing him instantly.
At trial, four eyewitnesses testified that 
they saw Abu-Jamal kill Faulkner, experts 
testified that the gun that killed Faulkner 
was Abu-Jamal’s, and jurors heard that 
a wounded Abu-Jamal was found at the 
scene of the crime. He was convicted and 
sentenced to death. Despite the conviction, 
the case has become a cause celebre for 
many reasons. Supporters claim that many 
procedural irregularities occurred during 
the trial and that the conviction of Abu-
Jamal violated his constitutional rights to 
a fair trial. Among other things, he was de-
nied the right to represent himself at trial. 
Others claim that Abu-Jamal was targeted 
and framed because of his radical political 
activities. The prosecution hid evidence, in-
timidated witnesses, and illegally excused 
potential African American jurors.
Abu-Jamal has now been on death row 
for more than 25 years. The case has at-
tracted the attention of anti–death penalty 
activists from all over the world. Abu- Jamal 
has continued his political activism, pub-
lished a book titled Live from Death Row, 
completed B.A. and M.A. degrees, and 
made frequent radio broadcasts. The 
French have made him an honorary citi-
zen of Paris and in 2006 named a street 
Rue Mumia Abu-Jamal in his honor. Or-
ganizations including Amnesty Interna-
tional,  Human Rights Watch, the European 
Parliament, and the Japanese Diet have 
demanded that he be awarded a new trial 
because of the problems in the original 
case. However, there are also groups who 
are aghast at the attention paid to some-
one they consider a cold-blooded cop killer. 
One group filed a lawsuit against the city 
of Paris, which said in part “awarding the 
honors of a city to a killer of a policeman is 
an immoral and irresponsible decision.”
In 2008, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 
Third Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 
murder conviction, but ordered a new capi-
tal sentencing hearing over concerns that 
the jury was improperly instructed. Mumia 
Abu-Jamal is currently incarcerated at 
Pennsylvania’s SCI Greene prison.
Critical criminologists view the Mumia 
Abu-Jamal case as an indicator of the so-
cial conflict that infects the nation’s social 
and political systems. People are targeted 
because of their political views, minorities 
cannot get a fair trial, and people who are 
viewed as a threat to the system may find 
themselves behind bars or even on death 
row. Conflict rather than consensus rules 
and shapes society.

Mumia Abu-Jamal
Mumia Abu-Jamal (born Wesley Cook on 
April 24, 1954) began his journalism career 
with the radical Black Panther party in the 
1960s. By the time he was 15, Abu-Jamal 
was appointed minister of information for 
the Philadelphia branch. After the Panther 
party disbanded, Abu-Jamal used his writ-
ing and speaking talent to become a lo-
cal broadcaster, even winning a Peabody 
Award for his coverage of the Pope’s visit; in 
1980, he became president of the Philadel-
phia Association of Black Journalists.
Then Mumia Abu-Jamal’s life was turned 
upside down when he was charged with first-
degree murder in the killing of Philadelphia 
police officer Daniel Faulkner. According to 
authorities, on December 9, 1981, Faulkner, 
25, stopped a car for driving the wrong way 
down the street. Calling for backup, he ap-
proached the car and asked the driver, Wil-
liam Cook, to exit the vehicle. A struggle 
ensued. According to prosecutors, Mumia 
Abu-Jamal, Cook’s older brother, was sit-
ting in a taxicab across the street watching 
the events unfold. Abu-Jamal approached 
Officer Faulkner and shot him in the back.

to receive stricter sentences if their personal characteristics 
(single, young, urban, male) show them to be members of 
the “dangerous classes.”63 Unemployed racial minorities 
may be perceived as “social dynamite” who present a real 
threat to society and must be controlled and incapacitated.64
Race also plays a role in prosecution and punishment. Afri-
can American defendants are more likely to be prosecuted 
under habitual offender statutes if they commit crimes 
where there is a greater likelihood of a white victim—for 
in minority neighborhoods, especially those that experience 
relative deprivation (African American residents earn signif-
icantly less money than the European American majority).61
The confl ict between police and the minority community 
can result in violence and charges of racism, a topic explored 
in the Profi les in Crime feature “Mumia Abu-Jamal.”
Criminal courts are also more likely to dole out harsh 
punishments to members of powerless, disenfranchised 
groups.62 Both white and black offenders have been found

CHAPTER 8 | Social Conflict, Critical Criminology, and Restorative Justice  279
Other critics suggest that critical theorists unfairly ne-
glect the capitalist system’s efforts to regulate itself—for 
example, by instituting antitrust regulations and putting vi-
olators in jail. Similarly, they ignore efforts to institute social 
reforms aimed at helping the poor.73 There seems to be no 
logic in condemning a system that helps the poor and em-
powers them to take on corporate interests in a court of law. 
Even inherently conservative institutions such as police de-
partments have made attempts at self-regulation when they 
become aware of class- and race-based inequality such as 
the use of racial profi ling in making traffi c stops.74
Some argue that critical thinkers refuse to address the 
problems and confl icts that exist in socialist countries, such 
as the gulags and purges of the Soviet Union under Stalin. 
Similarly, they fail to explain why some highly capitalist 
countries, such as Japan, have extremely low crime rates. 
Critical criminologists are too quick to blame capitalism for 
every human vice without adequate explanation or regard 
for other social and environmental factors.75 In so doing, 
they ignore objective reality and refuse to acknowledge that 
members of the lower classes tend to victimize one another. 
They ignore the plight of the lower classes, who must live in 
crime-ridden neighborhoods, while condemning the capi-
talist system from the security of the “ivory tower.”
FORMS OF CRITICAL 
CRIMINOLOGY
Critical criminologists are exploring new avenues of inquiry 
that fall outside the traditional models of confl ict and criti-
cal theories. The following sections discuss in detail some 
recent developments in the confl ict approach to crime.
Left Realism
Some critical scholars are now addressing the need for the left 
wing to respond to the increasing power of right-wing con-
servatives. They are troubled by the emergence of a strict “law 
and order” philosophy, which has as its centerpiece a policy of 
punishing juveniles severely in adult court. At the same time, 
they fi nd the focus of most left-wing scholarship—the abuse 
of power by the ruling elite—too narrow. It is wrong, they 
argue, to ignore inner-city gang crime and violence, which of-
ten target indigent people.76 The approach of left realism is 
most often connected to the writings of British scholars John 
Lea and Jock Young. In their well-respected 1984 work, What 
Is to Be Done About Law and Order?, they reject the utopian 
views of idealists who portray street criminals as revolutionar-
ies.77 They take the more “realistic” approach that street crim-
inals prey on the poor and disenfranchised, thus making the 
example, larceny and burglary—than if they commit violent 
crimes that are largely intraracial; where there is a perceived 
“racial threat,” punishment is enhanced.65 Critical analysis 
also shows that despite legal controls, the use of the death 
penalty also seems to be skewed against racial minorities.66
Considering these examples of how confl ict controls the 
justice process, it is not surprising when analysis of national 
population trends and imprisonment rates shows that as the 
percentage of minority group members increases in a pop-
ulation, the imprisonment rate does likewise.67 Similarly, 
states with a substantial minority population have a much 
higher imprisonment rate than those with predominantly 
white populations.68
Some critical researchers have attempted to show how 
capitalism infl uences the distribution of punishment. Rob-
ert Weiss found that the expansion of the prison population 
is linked to the need for capitalists to acquire a captive and 
low-paid labor force to compete with overseas laborers and 
domestic immigrant labor. Employing immigrants has its 
political downside because it displaces “American” workers 
and antagonizes their legal representatives. In contrast, using 
prison labor can be viewed as a humanitarian gesture. Weiss 
also observes that an ever-increasing prison population is 
politically attractive because it masks unemployment rates. 
Many inmates were chronically unemployed before their 
imprisonment; incarcerating the chronically unemployed al-
lows politicians to claim they have lowered unemployment. 
When the millions of people who are on probation and pa-
role and who must maintain jobs are added to the mix, the 
correctional system is now playing an increasingly impor-
tant role in suppressing wages and maintaining the profi t-
ability of capitalism.69
CRITIQUE OF CRITICAL 
CRIMINOLOGY
Critical criminology has been sharply criticized by some 
members of the criminological mainstream, who charge that 
its contribution has been “hot air, heat, but no real light.”70
In turn, critical thinkers have accused mainstream crimi-
nologists of being culprits in developing state control over 
individual lives and selling out their ideals for the chance to 
receive government funding.
Mainstream criminologists have also attacked the sub-
stance of critical thought. Some argue that critical theory 
simply rehashes the old tradition of helping the underdog, in 
which the poor steal from the rich to survive.71 In reality, most 
theft is for luxury, not survival. While the wealthy do com-
mit their share of illegal acts, these are nonviolent and leave 
no permanent injuries.72 People do not live in fear of corrupt 
businessmen and stock traders; they fear muggers and rapists.

work of strain theorists, social ecologists, and other main-
stream views. Community-based efforts seem to hold the 
greatest promise of crime control.
Left realism has been criticized by critical thinkers as 
legitimizing the existing power structure: by supporting 
existing defi nitions of law and justice, it suggests that the 
“deviant” and not the capitalist system causes society’s prob-
lems. Critics question whether left realists advocate the very 
institutions that “currently imprison us and our patterns of 
thought and action.”83 In rebuttal, left realists say that it is 
unrealistic to speak of a socialist state lacking a police force 
or a system of laws and justice. They believe the criminal 
code does, in fact, represent public opinion.
Critical Feminist Theory
Like so many theories in criminology, most of the efforts of 
critical theorists have been devoted to explaining male crim-
inality.84 To remedy this theoretical lapse, a number of femi-
nist writers have attempted to explain the cause of crime, 
gender differences in crime rates, and the exploitation of fe-
male victims from a critical perspective.
Critical feminism views gender inequality as stemming 
from the unequal power of men and women in a capitalist 
society, which leads to the exploitation of women by fathers 
and husbands. Under this system, women are considered a 
commodity worth possessing, like land or money.85
The origin of gender differences can be traced to the de-
velopment of private property and male domination of the 
laws of inheritance, which led to male control over prop-
erty and power.86 A patriarchal system developed in which 
men’s work was valued and women’s work was devalued. As 
capitalism prevailed, the division of labor by gender made 
women responsible for the unpaid maintenance and repro-
duction of the current and future labor force, which was de-
risively called “domestic work.” Although this unpaid work 
done by women is crucial and profi table for capitalists, who 
reap these free benefi ts, such labor is exploitative and op-
pressive for women.87 Even when women gained the right 
to work for pay, they were exploited as cheap labor. The 
dual exploitation of women within the household and in the 
labor market means that women produce far greater surplus 
value for capitalists than men.
Patriarchy, or male supremacy, has been and continues 
to be supported by capitalists. This system sustains female 
oppression at home and in the workplace.88 Although the 
number of traditional patriarchal families is in steep decline, 
in those that still exist, a wife’s economic dependence ties 
men more securely to wage-earning jobs, further serving the 
interests of capitalists by undermining potential rebellion 
against the system.
Patriarchy and Crime Critical feminists link criminal be-
havior patterns to the gender confl ict created by the economic 
and social struggles common in postindustrial societies. In 
poor doubly abused, fi rst by the capitalist system and then by 
members of their own class.
Lea and Young’s view of crime causation borrows from 
conventional sociological theory and closely resembles the 
relative deprivation approach, which posits that experienc-
ing poverty in the midst of plenty creates discontent and 
breeds crime. As they put it, “The equation is simple: rela-
tive deprivation equals discontent; discontent plus lack of 
political solution equals crime.”78
In a more recent book, Crime in Context: A Critical Crimi-
nology of Market Societies (1999), Ian Taylor recognizes that 
anyone who expects an instant socialist revolution to take 
place is simply engaging in wishful thinking.79 He uses 
data from both Europe and North America to show that the 
world is currently in the midst of multiple crises that are 
shaping all human interaction, including criminality. These 
crises include lack of job creation, social inequality, social 
fear, political incompetence and failure, gender confl ict, and 
family and parenting issues. These crises have led to a so-
ciety in which the government seems incapable of creating 
positive social change: people have become more fearful and 
isolated from one another and some are excluded from the 
mainstream because of racism and discrimination; manufac-
turing jobs have been exported overseas to nations that pay 
extremely low wages; and fi scal constraints inhibit the pos-
sibility of reform. These problems often fall squarely on the 
shoulders of young black men, who suffer from exclusion 
and poverty and who now feel the economic burden created 
by the erosion of manufacturing jobs due to the globaliza-
tion of the economy. In response, they engage in a form of 
hypermasculinity, which helps increase their crime rates.80
Crime Protection Left realists argue that crime victims 
in all classes need and deserve protection; crime control re-
fl ects community needs. They do not view police and the 
courts as inherently evil tools of capitalism whose tough tac-
tics alienate the lower classes. In fact, they recognize that 
these institutions offer life-saving public services. The left 
realists wish, however, that police would reduce their use 
of force and increase their sensitivity to the public.81 They 
want the police to be more responsive to community needs, 
end racial profi ling, and improve efforts at self-regulation 
and enforcement through citizen review boards and other 
control mechanisms.
Preemptive deterrence is an approach in which com-
munity organization efforts eliminate or reduce crime be-
fore police involvement becomes necessary. The reasoning 
behind this approach is that if the number of marginalized 
youths (those who feel they are not part of society and have 
nothing to lose by committing crime) could be reduced, 
then delinquency rates would decline.82
Although implementing a socialist economy might help 
eliminate the crime problem, left realists recognize that 
something must be done to control crime under the exist-
ing capitalist system. To develop crime control policies, left 
realists not only welcome critical ideas but also build on the

them to demonstrate physical bravery. Violence directed 
toward women is an especially economical way to demon-
strate manhood. Would a weak, effeminate male ever attack 
a woman?
Feminist writers have supported this view by maintaining 
that in contemporary society men achieve masculinity at the ex-
pense of women. In the best-case scenario, men must convince 
others that in no way are they feminine or have female quali-
ties. For example, they are sloppy and don’t cook or do house-
work because these are “female” activities. More ominously, 
men may work at excluding, hurting, denigrating, exploiting, 
or otherwise abusing women. Even in all-male groups, men of-
ten prove their manhood by treating the weakest member of 
the group as “woman-like” and abusing him accordingly. Men 
need to defend themselves at all costs from being contaminated 
with femininity, and these efforts begin in children’s playgroups 
and continue into adulthood and marriage.96
Exploitation and Criminality Critical feminists also focus 
on the social forces that shape women’s lives and experiences 
to explain female criminality.97 They attempt to show how 
the sexual victimization of girls is a function of male social-
ization because so many young males learn to be aggressive 
and to exploit women. Males seek out same-sex peer groups 
for social support; these groups encourage members to ex-
ploit and sexually abuse women. On college campuses, peers 
encourage sexual violence against women who are consid-
ered “teasers,” “bar pickups,” or “loose women.” These de-
rogatory labels allow the males to justify their actions; a code 
of secrecy then protects the aggressors from retribution.98
Capitalism, Patriarchy, and Crime, James Messerschmidt ar-
gues that capitalist society is marked by both patriarchy and 
class confl ict. Capitalists control the labor of workers, and 
men control women both economically and biologically.89 
This “double marginality” explains why females in a capitalist 
society commit fewer crimes than males. Because they are iso-
lated in the family, they have fewer opportunities to engage in 
elite deviance (white-collar and economic crimes). Although 
powerful females as well as males will commit white-collar 
crimes, the female crime rate is restricted because of the pa-
triarchal nature of the capitalist system.90 Women are also de-
nied access to male-dominated street crimes.
Because capitalism renders lower-class women power-
less, they are forced to commit less serious, nonviolent, self-
destructive crimes, such as abusing drugs. Recent efforts of 
the capitalist classes to undermine the social support of the 
poor has hit women particularly hard. The end of welfare, 
concentration on welfare fraud, and cutbacks to social ser-
vices, all have directly and uniquely affected women.91
Powerlessness also increases the likelihood that women 
will become targets of violent acts.92 When lower-class males 
are shut out of the economic opportunity structure, they try 
to build their self-image through acts of machismo; such acts 
may involve violent abuse of women. This type of reaction 
accounts for a signifi cant percentage of female victims who 
are attacked by a spouse or intimate partner. According to 
this view, female victimization should decline as women’s 
place in society is elevated, and they are able to obtain more 
power at home, in the workplace, and in government. Em-
pirical research seems to support this view. A 2004 cross-
national study of educational and 
occupational status of women 
shows that in nations where the 
status of women is generally high, 
sexual violence rates are signifi-
cantly lower than in nations where 
women do not enjoy similar educa-
tional and occupational opportuni-
ties.93 Women’s victimization rates 
decline as they are empowered so-
cially, economically, and legally.94
In Masculinities and Crime, 
Messerschmidt expands on these 
themes.95 He suggests that in every 
culture males try to emulate “ideal” 
masculine behaviors. In Western 
culture, this means being authori-
tative, in charge, combative, and 
controlling. Failure to adopt these 
roles leaves men feeling effeminate 
and unmanly. Their struggle to 
dominate women in order to prove 
their manliness is called “doing 
gender.” Crime is a vehicle for men 
to “do gender” because it separates 
them from the weak and allows 
Critical feminists view gender inequality as a function of female exploitation by men. Women have 
become a “commodity” worth possessing, like land or money. The origin of gender differences can 
be traced to the development of private property and men’s domination over the laws of 
inheritance, which led to their control over property and power. Are these teen prostitutes—shown

and his associates found that when fathers and mothers hold 
equally valued managerial positions, the similarity between 
the rates of their daughters’ and sons’ delinquency is great-
est. By implication, middle-class girls are the most likely to 
violate the law because they are less closely controlled than 
their lower-class counterparts. In homes in which both par-
ents hold positions of power, girls are more likely to have the 
same expectations of career success as their brothers. Conse-
quently, siblings of both sexes will be socialized to take risks 
and engage in other behavior related to delinquency.
Evaluating Power–Control This power–control theory 
has received a great deal of attention in the criminological 
community because it encourages a new approach to the 
study of criminality, one that includes gender differences, class 
position, and the structure of the family. Empirical analysis 
of its premises has generally been supportive. Brenda Sims 
Blackwell’s research supports a key element of power–control 
theory: females in paternalistic households have learned to 
fear legal sanctions more than have their brothers.105
Not all research is as supportive.106 Some critics have 
questioned its core assumption that power and control vari-
ables can explain crime.107 More specifi cally, critics fail to 
replicate the fi nding that upper-class girls are more likely to 
deviate than their lower-class peers or that class and power 
interact to produce delinquency.108 Some researchers have 
found few gender-based supervision and behavior differ-
ences in worker-, manager-, or owner-dominated house-
holds.109 Research indicates that single-mother families may 
be different from two-parent egalitarian families, though 
Hagan’s theory equates the two.110
It is possible that the concept of family employed by 
Hagan may have to be reconsidered. Power–control theorists 
should consider the multitude of power and control rela-
tionships that are emerging in postmodern society: blended 
families, families where mothers hold managerial positions 
and fathers are blue-collar workers, and so forth.111
Finally, power and control may interact with other per-
sonal traits, such as personality and self-control, to shape be-
havior.112 Further research is needed to determine whether 
power–control can have an independent infl uence on be-
havior and can explain gender differences in the crime rate.
Peacemaking Criminology
To members of the peacemaking movement, the main pur-
pose of criminology is to promote a peaceful, just society. 
Rather than standing on empirical analysis of data, peace-
making draws its inspiration from religious and philosophical 
teachings ranging from Quakerism to Zen.113 For example, 
rather than seeing socioeconomic status as a “variable” that 
is correlated with crime, as do mainstream criminologists, 
peacemakers view poverty as a source of suffering—almost 
a crime in and of itself. Poverty enervates people, makes 
them suffer, and becomes a master status that subjects them 
According to the critical feminist view, exploitation trig-
gers the onset of female delinquent and deviant behavior. 
When female victims run away and abuse substances, they 
may be reacting to abuse they have suffered at home or at 
school. Their attempts at survival are labeled as deviant or 
delinquent behavior.99 When the exploited girl fi nds herself 
in the arms of the justice system her problems may just be 
beginning. While boys who get in trouble may be considered 
“overzealous” youth or kids who just went too far, young girls 
who get in trouble are seen as in opposition and a threat to 
acceptable images of femininity; their behavior is considered 
even more unusual and dangerous than male delinquency.100
Power–Control Theory
John Hagan and his associates have created a critical femi-
nist model that uses gender differences to explain the onset 
of criminality.101 Hagan’s view is that crime and delinquency 
rates are a function of two factors: class position (power) 
and family functions (control).102 The link between these 
two variables is that, within the family, parents reproduce 
the power relationships they hold in the workplace; a posi-
tion of dominance at work is equated with control in the 
household. As a result, parents’ work experiences and class 
position infl uence the criminality of children.103
In paternalistic families, fathers assume the traditional 
role of breadwinners, while mothers tend to have menial jobs 
or remain at home to supervise domestic matters. Within 
the paternalistic home, mothers are expected to control the 
behavior of their daughters while granting greater freedom 
to sons. In such a home, the parent–daughter relationship 
can be viewed as a preparation for the “cult of domesticity,” 
which makes girls’ involvement in delinquency unlikely, 
whereas boys are freer to deviate because they are not subject 
to maternal control. Girls growing up in patriarchal families 
are socialized to fear legal sanctions more than are males; 
consequently, boys in these families exhibit more delinquent 
behavior than their sisters. The result is that boys not only 
engage in more antisocial behaviors but have greater access to 
legitimate adult behaviors, such as working at part-time jobs 
or possessing their own transportation. In contrast, without 
these legitimate behavioral outlets, girls who are unhappy or 
dissatisfi ed with their status are forced to seek out risky role 
exit behaviors, including such desperate measures as run-
ning away and contemplating suicide.
In egalitarian families—those in which the husband 
and wife share similar positions of power at home and in the 
workplace—daughters gain a kind of freedom that refl ects 
reduced parental control. These families produce daughters 
whose law-violating behavior mirrors their brothers’. In an 
egalitarian family, girls may have greater opportunity to en-
gage in legitimate adult status behaviors and less need to 
enact deviant role exits.104
Ironically, Hagan believes that these relationships also oc-
cur in female-headed households with absent fathers. Hagan

to lives fi lled with suffering. From a peacemaking perspec-
tive, a key avenue for preventing crime is, in the short run, 
diminishing the suffering poverty causes and, in the long 
run, embracing social policies that reduce the prevalence of 
economic suffering in contemporary society.114
Peacemakers view the efforts of the state to punish 
and control as crime-encouraging rather than crime-dis-
couraging. These views were fi rst articulated in a series of 
books with an anarchist theme written by criminologists 
Larry Tifft and Dennis Sullivan in 1980.115 Tifft argues, 
“The violent punishing acts of the state and its controlling 
professions are of the same genre as the violent acts of in-
dividuals. In each instance these acts refl ect an attempt to 
monopolize human interaction.”116
Sullivan stresses the futility of correcting and punish-
ing criminals in the context of our confl ict-ridden society: 
“The reality we must grasp is that we live in a culture of 
severed relationships, where every available institution 
provides a form of banishment but no place or means for 
people to become connected, to be responsible to and for 
each other.”117 Sullivan suggests that mutual aid rather 
than coercive punishment is the key to a harmonious so-
ciety. In Restorative Justice, Sullivan and Tifft reaffi rm their 
belief that society must seek humanitarian forms of justice 
without resorting to brutal punishments:
By allowing feelings of vengeance or retribution to narrow 
our focus on the harmful event and the person respon-
sible for it—as others might focus solely on a sin com-
mitted and the “sinner”—we tell ourselves we are taking 
steps to free ourselves from the effects of the harm or the 
sin in question. But, in fact, we are putting ourselves in 
a servile position with respect to life, human growth, and 
the further enjoyment of relationships with others.118
Today, advocates of the peacemaking movement, such as 
Harold Pepinsky and Richard Quinney, try to fi nd humanist 
solutions to crime and other social problems.119 Rather than

Restorative justice advocates want to take coercion out of the justice 
process, and for that reason they are opposed to the death penalty. 
At a rally kicking off Amnesty International USA’s annual meeting in 
Austin, Texas, attendees raised black flags in protest and called on 
Republican Governor Rick Perry and Texas legislators to abolish the 
death penalty. Can restorative principles be applied to criminals who 
commit the most violent, heinous crimes, or are they only suitable for 
petty and first-time offenders?

the process of healing. Zehr maintains that the core value 
of the restoration process can be translated into respect for 
all, even those who are different from us, even those who 
seem to be our enemies. At its core, Zehr argues, restor-
ative justice is a set of principles, a philosophy, an alternate 
set of guiding questions that provide an alternative frame-
work for thinking about wrongdoing.122 Restorative justice 
would reject concepts such as “punishment,” “deterrence” 
and “incarceration” and embrace “apology,” “rehabilitation,” 
“reparation,” “healing,” “restoration,” and “reintegration.” 
The Thinking Like a Criminologist feature explores an ethi-
cal dilemma that might be produced by a restorative justice 
program.
Restorative justice has grown out of a belief that the tra-
ditional justice system has done little to involve the commu-
nity in the process of dealing with crime and wrongdoing. 
What has developed is a system of coercive punishments, 
administered by bureaucrats, that are inherently harmful 
to offenders and reduce the likelihood offenders will ever 
become productive members of society. This system relies 
on punishment, stigma, and disgrace. In his controversial 
book, The Executed God: The Way of the Cross in Lockdown 
America, theology professor Mark Lewis Taylor discusses 
the similarities between this contemporary, coercive justice 
system and that which existed in imperial Rome when Je-
sus and many of his followers were executed because they 
were an inspiration to the poor and slave populations. They 
represented a threat to the ruling Roman power structure. 
So, too, is our modern justice system designed to keep 
the downtrodden in their place. Taylor suggests that there 
should be a movement to reduce such coercive elements 
of justice as police brutality and the death penalty before 
our “lockdown society” becomes the model used around 
the globe.123
CRITICAL THEORY AND 
PUBLIC POLICY
At the core of all the varying branches of social confl ict the-
ory is the fact that confl ict causes crime. If confl ict and com-
petition in society could somehow be reduced, it is possible 
that crime rates would fall. Some critical theorists believe 
this goal can only be accomplished by thoroughly reorder-
ing society so that capitalism is destroyed and a socialist 
state is created. Others call for a more “practical” application 
of confl ict principles. Nowhere has this been more success-
ful than in applying peacemaking principles in the criminal 
justice system.
Rather than punish law violators harshly and make 
them outcasts of society, peacemakers look for ways to bring 
them back to the community. This peacemaking move-
ment has adopted nonviolent methods and applied them to 
what is known as restorative justice. Springing both from 
academia and justice system personnel, the restorative ap-
proach relies on nonpunitive strategies for crime prevention 
and control.121 The next sections discuss the foundation and 
principles of restorative justice.
The Concept of Restorative Justice
The term restorative justice is often hard to defi ne because it 
encompasses a variety of programs and practices. Accord-
ing to a leading restorative justice scholar, Howard Zehr, re-
storative justice requires that society address victims’ harms 
and needs, hold offenders accountable to put right those 
harms, and involve victims, offenders, and communities in 
A student wants to discuss a personal matter. It 
seems that a few weeks ago she was at a party 
when she was sexually assaulted by a fellow stu-
dent. The attack was quite traumatic and she 
suffered both physical and emotional injury. The 
police were called and the boy charged with 
rape. Now that a few weeks have passed, she 
has been contacted by a local program that 
bills itself as a restorative treatment program. 
It seems that her attacker is now a client and 
wants to engage in some form of reconciliation. 
At an arranged meeting, he professes his regret for the 
attack and wishes to make amends. He and the program director 
have worked out a schedule in which the victim will be compensated 
for her pain and suffering in the amount of $5,000 in exchange for 
her agreeing to a recommendation to the pros-
ecutor that the case be treated informally rather 
than going to trial. She doesn’t know what to do: 
she needs the money, having missed work after 
the attack, but at the same time is concerned that 
people will think she has accepted a bribe to with-
draw the charges.
❯❯ Write a paper describing the advice you 
would give to the student in this situation. How 
would you suggest that she respond to the pro-
gram director? Do you consider the payment a 
bribe or restitution for an evil deed? Can restorative justice be 
used in a crime such as rape?

CHAPTER 8 | Social Conflict, Critical Criminology, and Restorative Justice  285
For example, most states have passed sex offender registry 
and notifi cation laws that make public the names of those 
convicted of sex offenses and warn neighbors of their pres-
ence in the community.127
But the fear of shame can backfire or be neutralized. 
When shame is managed well, people acknowledge they 
made mistakes and suffered disappointments, and try to 
work out what can be done to make things right; this is re-
ferred to as shame management. However, in some cases, 
to avoid the pain of shaming, people engage in improper 
shame management, a psychological process in which they 
deny shame by shifting the blame of their actions to their 
target or to others.128 They may blame others, get angry, and 
take out their frustrations on those whom they can domi-
nate. Improper shame management of this sort has been 
linked to antisocial acts ranging from school yard bullying 
to tax evasion.129
Massive levels of improper shame management may oc-
cur on a societal scale during periods of social upheaval. 
Because of this, some nations that previously have had low 
crime rates may experience a surge of antisocial behavior 
during periods of war and revolution. Rape, an act which 
may have been unthinkable to most men, suddenly be-
comes commonplace because of the emergence of narcis-
sistic pride, feeling dominant and arrogant, and developing 
a sense of superiority over others, in this case your enemy. 
This sense of hubris fosters aggressive actions and allows 
combatants to rape women whom they perceive as belong-
ing to an enemy group.130
Braithwaite argues that crime control can be better 
achieved through a policy of reintegrative shaming. Here 
disapproval is extended to the offenders’ evil deeds, while 
at the same time they are cast as respected people who can 
be reaccepted by society. A critical element of reintegrative 
shaming occurs when the offenders begin to understand 
and recognize their wrongdoing and shame themselves. To 
be reintegrative, shaming must be brief and controlled and 
then followed by ceremonies of forgiveness, apology, and 
repentance.
To prevent crime, Braithwaite charges, society must en-
courage reintegrative shaming. For example, the women’s 
movement can reduce domestic violence by mounting a 
crusade to shame spouse abusers.131 Similarly, parents who 
use reintegrative shaming techniques in their childrearing 
practices may improve parent–child relationships and ul-
timately reduce the delinquent involvement of their chil-
dren.132 Because informal social controls may have a greater 
impact than legal or formal ones, it may not be surprising 
that the fear of personal shame can have a greater deterrent 
effect than the fear of legal sanctions. It may also be applied 
to produce specific deterrence. Offenders can meet with 
victims so that the offenders can experience shame. Fam-
ily members and peers can be present to help the offender 
reintegrate.133 Such efforts can humanize a system of justice 
that today relies on repression rather than forgiveness as the 
basis of specifi c deterrence.
Advocates of restorative justice argue that rather than 
today’s lockdown mentality, what is needed is a justice 
policy that repairs the harm caused by crime and that in-
cludes all parties who have suffered from that harm: the 
victim, the community, and the offender. They have made 
an ongoing effort to reduce the confl ict created by the crim-
inal justice system when it hands out harsh punishments 
to offenders, many of whom are powerless social outcasts. 
Based on the principle of reducing social harm, restorative 
justice advocates argue that the old methods of punishment 
are a failure: after all, upwards of two-thirds of all prison 
inmates recidivate soon after their release. And tragically, 
not all inmates are released. Some are given life sentences 
for relatively minor crimes under three strikes laws, which 
mandate such a sentence for a third conviction; some are 
given sentences of life with no parole, which are in essence 
death sentences.124
Reintegrative Shaming
One of the key foundations of the restoration movement 
is contained in John Braithwaite’s infl uential book Crime, 
Shame, and Reintegration.125 Braithwaite’s vision rests on the 
concept of shame: the feeling we get when we don’t meet 
the standards we have set for ourselves or that signifi cant 
others have set for us. Shame can lead people to believe 
that they are defective, that there is something wrong with 
them. Braithwaite notes that countries such as Japan, in 
which conviction for crimes brings an inordinate amount 
of shame, have extremely low crime rates. In Japan, crimi-
nal prosecution proceeds only when the normal process of 
public apology, compensation, and the victim’s forgiveness 
breaks down.
Shame is a powerful tool of informal social control. Citi-
zens in cultures in which crime is not shameful, such as the 
United States, do not internalize an abhorrence for crime 
because when they are punished, they view themselves as 
mere victims of the justice system. Their punishment comes 
at the hands of neutral strangers, such as police and judges, 
who are being paid to act. In contrast, shaming relies on the 
victim’s participation.126
Braithwaite divides the concept of shame into two dis-
tinct types. The most common form of shaming typically 
involves stigmatization, an ongoing process of degradation 
in which the offender is branded as an evil person and cast 
out of society. Shaming can occur at a school disciplinary 
hearing or a criminal court trial. Bestowing stigma and deg-
radation may have a general deterrent effect: it makes peo-
ple afraid of social rejection and public humiliation. As a 
specifi c deterrent, stigma is doomed to failure; people who 
suffer humiliation at the hands of the justice system “re-
ject their rejectors” by joining a deviant subculture of like-
minded people who collectively resist social control. Despite 
these dangers, there has been an ongoing effort to brand of-
fenders and make their shame both public and permanent.

286  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Restoration involves turning the justice system into a 
 
■
“healing” process rather than being a distributor of ret-
ribution and revenge.
Reconciliation is a big part of the restorative approach. 
 
■
Most people involved in offender–victim relationships 
actually know one another or were related in some way 
before the criminal incident took place. Instead of treat-
ing one of the involved parties as a victim deserving of 
sympathy and the other as a criminal deserving of pun-
ishment, it is more productive to address the issues that 
produced confl ict between these people.134
The effectiveness of justice ultimately depends on the 
 
■
stake a person has in the community (or a particular 
social group). If a person does not value his or her 
membership in the group, the person will be unlikely 
to accept responsibility, show remorse, or repair the 
injuries caused by his or her actions. In contrast, people 
who have a stake in the community and its principle 
institutions, such as work, home, and school, fi nd that 
their involvement enhances their personal and familial 
well-being.135
The offender must make a commitment to both mate-
 
■
rial (monetary) restitution and symbolic reparation 
(an apology). A determination must also be made of 
community support and assistance for both victim and 
offender.
The intended result of the process is to repair injuries 
suffered by the victim and the community while ensuring 
reintegration of the offender.
Restoration Programs Negotiation, 
mediation, consensus-building, and 
peacemaking have been part of the dis-
pute resolution process in European 
and Asian communities for centuries.136 
Native American and Native Canadian 
people have long used the type of com-
munity participation in the adjudication 
process (for example, sentencing circles, 
sentencing panels, elders panels) that 
restorative justice advocates are now 
embracing.137
In some Native American communi-
ties, people accused of breaking the law 
meet with community members, victims 
(if any), village elders, and agents of the 
justice system in a sentencing circle. 
Each member of the circle expresses his 
or her feelings about the act that was 
committed and raises questions or con-
cerns. The accused can express regret 
about his or her actions and a desire to 
change the harmful behavior. People 
may suggest ways the offender can make 
things up to the community and those 
The Process of Restoration
The restoration process begins by redefi ning crime in terms 
of a confl ict among the offender, the victim, and affected 
constituencies (families, schools, workplaces, and so forth). 
Therefore, it is vitally important that the resolution take 
place within the context in which the confl ict originally oc-
curred rather than being transferred to a specialized insti-
tution that has no social connection to the community or 
group from which the confl ict originated. In other words, 
most confl icts are better settled in the community than in 
a court.
By maintaining “ownership” or jurisdiction over the 
confl ict, the community is able to express its shared outrage 
about the offense. Shared community outrage is directly 
communicated to the offender. The victim is also given a 
chance to voice his or her story, and the offender can di-
rectly communicate his or her need for social reintegration 
and treatment. All restoration programs involve an under-
standing among all the parties involved in a criminal act: the 
victim, the offender, and community. Although processes 
differ in structure and style, they generally include these 
elements:
The offender is asked to recognize that he or she caused 
 
■
injury to personal and social relations along with a 
determination and acceptance of responsibility (ideally 
accompanied by a statement of remorse). Only then can 
the offender be restored as a productive member of the 
community.
Restoration programs can take many forms. Regina Talbert and Anthony Belcher hand out food 
and clothing on skid row in Los Angeles, February 16, 2007. The two former addicts are part of 
the New Directions team, who perform outreach to addicted and alcoholic army, navy, and air 
force veterans in some of the city’s most dangerous neighborhoods. Veterans of U.S. wars, 
including the current campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, are increasingly turning up with 
alarming signs of PTSD and other serious mental issues. Regina (left), who has been in 
recovery for nine years, hands out fliers about the New Directions treatment center. Would 
you consider this a “restoration”-based initiative?

the discussion on condemning the act without condemn-
ing the character of the actor. Offenders are asked to tell 
their side of the story, what happened, how they have felt 
about the crime, and what they think should be done. The 
victims and others are asked to describe the physical, fi -
nancial, and emotional consequences of the crime. This 
discussion may lead the offenders, their families, and their 
friends to experience the shame of the act, prompting an 
apology to the victim. A plan of action is developed and 
signed by key participants. The plan may include the of-
fender paying compensation to the victim, doing work for 
the victim or the community, or similar solutions. It is the 
responsibility of the conference participants to determine 
the outcomes that are most appropriate for these particular 
victims and these particular offenders. All eight states and 
territories in Australia have used the conference model at 
some time or another.
Reconciliation Restoration has also been used as a na-
tional policy to heal internal rifts. For example, after 50 years 
of oppressive white rule in South Africa, the race-dividing 
apartheid policy was abolished in the early 1990s, and in 
1994 Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Con-
gress (ANC), was elected president.143 Some black leaders 
wanted revenge for the political murders carried out during 
the apartheid era, but Mandela established the Truth and Rec-
onciliation Commission. Rather than seeking vengeance for 
the crimes, this government agency investigated the atroci-
ties with the mandate of granting amnesty to those individu-
als who confessed their roles in the violence and could prove 
that their actions served some political motive rather than 
being based on personal factors such as greed or jealousy.
Supporters of the commission believed that this ap-
proach would help heal the nation’s wounds and prevent 
years of racial and ethnic strife. Mandela, who had been un-
justly jailed for 27 years by the regime, had reason to desire 
vengeance. Yet, he wanted to move the country forward af-
ter the truth of what happened in the past had been estab-
lished. Though many South Africans, including some ANC 
members, believe that the commission is too lenient, Man-
dela’s attempts at reconciliation have prevailed. The com-
mission is a model of restoration over revenge.
In sum, restoration can be or has been used at the fol-
lowing stages of justice:

■
As a tool for school offi cials

he or she harmed. A treatment program, such as Alcoholics 
Anonymous, can be suggested, if appropriate.
Restorative justice is now being embraced on many lev-
els within our society and the justice system:
Community. 
 
■
Communities that isolate people and have 
few mechanisms for interpersonal interaction encour-
age and sustain crime. Those that implement forms of 
community dialogue to identify problems and plan tac-
tics for their elimination, guided by restorative justice 
practices and principles, may create a climate in which 
violent crime is less likely to occur.138
Schools. 
 
■
Some schools have embraced restorative jus-
tice practices to deal with students who are involved 
in drug and alcohol abuse without having to resort to 
more punitive measures such as expulsion. Schools in 
Minnesota, Colorado, and elsewhere are now trying 
to involve students in “relational rehabilitation” pro-
grams that strive to improve individuals’ relationships 
with key fi gures in the community who may have been 
harmed by their actions.139
Police. 
 
■
Restorative justice has also been implemented 
by police when crime is fi rst encountered. The new 
community policing models are an attempt to bring 
restorative concepts into law enforcement. Restor-
ative justice relies on the fact that criminal justice 
policymakers need to listen and respond to the needs 
of those who are to be affected by their actions, and 
community policing relies on policies established 
with input and exchanges between offi cers and 
citizens.140
Courts. 
 
■
Restorative programs in the courts typically 
involve diverting the formal court process. These pro-
grams encourage meeting and reconciling the confl icts 
between offenders and victims via victim advocacy, 
mediation programs, and sentencing circles, in which 
crime victims and their families are brought together 
with offenders and their families in an effort to formu-
late a sanction that addresses the needs of each party. 
Victims are given a chance to voice their stories, and 
offenders can help compensate them fi nancially or pro-
vide some service (for example, fi xing damaged prop-
erty).141 The goal is to enable offenders to appreciate 
the damage they have caused, to make amends, and to 
be reintegrated back into society.
Restoration programs are being used in court systems 
around the world. One example is the justice system in 
Australia, which makes use of a conferencing process to 
divert offenders from the justice system.142 This offers of-
fenders the opportunity to attend a conference to discuss 
and resolve their offense instead of being charged and ap-
pearing in court. (Those who deny guilt are not offered 
conferencing.) The conference, normally lasting one to 
two hours, is attended by the victims and their support-
ers, the defendant and his or her supporters, and other 
concerned parties. The conference coordinator focuses

288  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
The RESTORE Program
One of the Denver VORP programs is de-
signed to help kids who have gotten into 
trouble by shoplifting from a local store.
When a youth is referred by juvenile court, 
a RESTORE intake form is completed. The 
youth and a parent or guardian attend two 
RESTORE sessions and complete a con-
tract, as described below.
Part 1. During this session, the youth and 
their parents listen to speakers discuss 
the impact of shoplifting on the merchant 
community, as well as the community-at-
large. They also hear other youth speak 
about how shoplifting has affected them, 
their peers, and their families.
Part 2. The youth and their parents 
meet in smaller groups to talk about the 
shoplifting incidents they were involved 
in and how they have been affected by 
this incident. This group also includes 
other juvenile shoplifters, their parents, 
community member, peer representa-
tive, and merchant representative, and 
is facilitated by RESTORE volunteers.
Part 3. When the group sessions are 
complete, each youth (with his/her par-
ent or guardian) reviews and signs a con-
tract to repair the harm to the victim, the 
community, their family, and themselves, 
including community service. They sign 
up for a contract completion date and 
time to return to the RESTORE council.
The youth returns in one or two months 
to present his or her completed contract 
results and projects, including verification 
of community service and other contract 
items. By participating in the RESTORE 
program, youth can:
Learn more about shoplifting and how it 
 
■
affects victims and the community
Repair the harm done by the incident in 
 
■
a meaningful way
Make choices about the consequences 
 
■
for their actions
Have their theft charge dismissed upon 
 
■
successful completion of the program
The RESTORE program uses the prin-
ciples of restorative justice to reintegrate 
young offenders back into the community. It 
is an example of turning theory into action.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Could you design a program for recre-
ational drug users using the RESTORE 
model?
 2. Do you believe restorative justice pro-
grams can work or are they a method 
for kids who commit crime to avoid 
legal responsibility?

Program of Denver, 2009, www.denvervorp.org 
(accessed September 25, 2010).
The Victim Offender Reconciliation Pro-
gram (VORP) of Denver began in 1993 
in response to a summer of violence in 
the metro Denver area. VORP has col-
laborated with the justice system to pro-
vide restorative justice processes for the 
community as a way of addressing issues 
overlooked in a more traditional, adversar-
ial justice system. VORP has been a cata-
lyst for long-term answers to crime. Each 
system has its role and provides part of 
the solution to the problem of administer-
ing justice. The VORP program, steeped 
in diverse cultural roots, gives an opportu-
nity for reconciling and restoring relation-
ships between victims, offenders, and the 
community.
Programs are conducted by trained 
volunteers in restorative justice, media-
tion, facilitation, cultural competency, and 
communication. Currently VORP offers 
victim–offender mediation, community 
group conferencing, peace circles, and a 
reparative panel as restorative justice tools. 
As needed, VORP staff and facilitators also 
work one on one with victims and offenders 
of crime.
VORP has three principal aims in fur-
thering its mission:
Reduce recidivism
 
■
Restore and strengthen community 
 
■
relationships
Empower victims and the community

The Challenge of Restorative Justice
Restorative justice holds great promise, but there are also 
some concerns:
Is it a political movement or a treatment process? 
 
■
Restorative justice is viewed as an extremely liberal 
alternative, and its advocates often warn of the uneven 
exercise of state power. Some view it as a social move-
ment rather than a method of rehabilitation.145 Can it 
survive in a culture that is becoming increasingly con-
servative and focused on security rather than personal 
freedom?
Restorative justice programs must be wary of the 
 
■
cultural and social differences that can be found 
throughout our heterogeneous society. What may be 
considered “restorative” in one subculture may be con-
sidered insulting and damaging in another.146
There is still no single defi nition of what constitutes 
 
■
restorative justice.147 Consequently, many diverse pro-
grams that call themselves restorative-oriented pursue 
objectives that seem remote from the restorative ideal.
Restorative justice programs face the diffi cult task of bal-
 
■
ancing the needs of offenders with those of their victims. 
If programs focus solely on victims’ needs, they may risk 
ignoring the offenders’ needs and increase the likelihood 
of reoffending. Declan Roache, a lecturer in law at the 
London School of Economics, makes the argument that 
the seductive promise of restorative justice may blind

offenders learn prosocial ways of behaving. Restorative 
justice advocates may falsely assume that relatively brief 
interludes of public shaming will change deeply rooted 
criminal predispositions.149
These are a few of the obstacles that restorative justice 
programs must overcome to be successful and productive. 
Yet because the method holds so much promise, criminolo-
gists are conducting numerous demonstration projects to 
fi nd the most effective means of returning the ownership of 
justice to the people and the community.150
admirers to the benefi ts of traditional methods and pre-
vent them from understanding or appreciating some of 
the pitfalls of restoration. There is danger, he warns, in a 
process that is essentially informal, without lawyers, and 
with little or no oversight on the outcome. The restora-
tion process gives participants unchecked power with-
out the benefi t of procedural safeguards.148
Benefi ts may only work in the short term while ignor-
 
■
ing long-term treatment needs. Sharon Levrant and her 
colleagues suggest that restorative justice programs that 
feature short-term interactions with victims fail to help 
 1. Be familiar with the concept of 
social confl ict and how it 
shapes behavior
Social confl ict theorists view 
 
■
crime as a function of the con-
fl ict that exists in society. Con-
fl ict theorists suggest that crime 
in any society is caused by class 
confl ict. Laws are created by 
those in power to protect their 
own rights and serve their own 
interests.
 2. Be able to discuss elements of 
confl ict in the criminal justice 
system
All criminal acts have political 
 
■
undertones. The justice system 
is biased against the poor and 
designed to protect the wealthy. 
Social and political oppression 
produce crime. Crime would 
disappear if equality rather than 
discrimination was the norm.
 3. Be familiar with the ideas of 
critical criminology
Critical criminology views the 
 
■
competitive nature of the capi-
talist system as a major cause of 
crime. The poor commit crimes 
because of their frustration, 
anger, and need. The wealthy 
engage in illegal acts because 
they are used to competition 
and because they must do so to 
maintain their positions in so-
ciety. Critical scholars have at-
tempted to show that the law is 
designed to protect the wealthy 
and powerful and to control the 
poor, “have-not” members of 
society.
 4. Defi ne the concept of state 
 (organized) crime
State crimes involve a violation 
 
■
of citizen trust. They are acts 
defi ned by law as criminal and 
committed by state offi cials in 
pursuit of their jobs as govern-
ment representatives. Some 
state crimes are committed by 
individuals who abuse their 
state authority, or fail to exercise 
it, when working with people 
and organizations in the private 
sector. State–corporate crime 
involves the deviant activities 
by which the privileged classes 
strive to maintain or increase 
their power.
 5. Be able to discuss the difference 
between structural theory and 
instrumental theory
Critical theorists subscribe to 
 
■
either instrumental theory or 
structural theory. Instrumental 
theorists hold that those in 
authority wield their power to 
control society and keep the 
lower classes in check. Struc-
tural theorists believe that the 
justice system is designed to 
maintain the status quo and is 
used to punish the wealthy, as 
well as members of the lower 
classes, when they break the 
rules governing capitalism.
 6. Know the various techniques of 
critical research
SUMMARY
Research on critical theory fo-
 
■
cuses on how the justice system 
was designed and how it oper-
ates to further class interests. 
Quite often, this research uses 
historical analysis to show how 
the capitalist classes have ex-
erted control over the police, 
the courts, and correctional 
agencies.
 7. Be familiar with the critiques of 
critical criminology
Critical criminology has been 
 
■
criticized by traditional crimi-
nologists. Some critics suggest 
that critical criminologists make 
fundamental errors in their 
concepts of ownership and class 
interest.
 8. Know some of the basic ideas of 
critical feminism
Critical feminist writers draw 
 
■
attention to the infl uence of 
patriarchal society on crime. 
According to power–control 
theory, gender differences in the 
crime rate can be explained by 
the structure of the family in a 
capitalist society.
 9. Explain the concept of left 
realism
Left realism sees crime as a 
 
■
function of relative depriva-
tion under capitalism and 
views the justice system as 
necessary to protect the lower 
classes until a socialist society 
can be developed, which will 
end crime.

In 2004, Californians Thomas and Jackie Hawks decided to sell their yacht, which had been their full-time 
home, and settle down to spend more time with their grandchild. They were contacted by a proposed buyer, 
Skylar Deleon, who seemed interested enough to take a test cruise. When Deleon showed up on November 15, 
2004, he was accompanied by his wife, Jennifer Henderson, and two male companions, Alonso Machain and 
John Kennedy. The trio soon overpowered the Hawks and beat, blindfolded, and gagged the terrifi ed couple. 
Deleon took out a laptop computer and started demanding personal information, including Social Security 
numbers, dates of birth, and Jackie Hawks’s maiden name, so their accounts could be later looted. Finally the 
gang handcuffed the Hawks to the yacht’s anchor and sent them hurtling to their deaths in the ocean. Deleon

296  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
FOUNDATIONS OF 
DEVELOPMENTAL THEORY
During the twentieth century, some criminologists began 
to integrate sociological, psychological, and economic ele-
ments into more complex developmental views of crime 
causation. Hans Eysenck published Crime and Personality in 
1964 and proclaimed that antisocial behavior was linked to 
psychological conditions that were a product of heredity.2
His controversial theory integrated social, biological, and 
psychological factors, a vision that upset the sociologists 
who controlled the fi eld at that time.3
However, it is Sheldon (1896–1980) and Eleanor 
(1898–1972) Glueck who are today considered founders of 
the developmental branch of criminological theory. While at 
Harvard University in the 1930s, they conducted research 
(shown in the photo on page 294) and the other men then turned the boat around and began an hour-long trip 
back to the shore, during which they cracked open beers and fi shed over the side of the boat.
After the plot unraveled, Jennifer Henderson was tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to life in 
prison without the possibility of parole. Machain cooperated with the prosecution in a deal to avoid the death 
penalty; co-conspirator Kennedy was sentenced to death for the crime, as was Skylar Deleon.
Deleon’s personal story is as bizarre as his crime was horrifi c. Born John Julius Jacobson, Jr., the son of a 
convicted drug dealer, he began acting in bit parts in commercials as a child and at age 14, appeared in the 
series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. At age 20, when his acting career faltered because he had a diffi cult 
time remembering lines, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps, but went AWOL 15 days later and received a 
dishonorable discharge. He drifted into a life of petty and serious crime.
At his trial, in an effort to spare him the death penalty, Deleon’s lawyer and other witnesses told the jury 
that he had suffered a horrifi c childhood, during which his brutal drug-addicted father exposed him to both 
physical and sexual abuse. From the time he was 2 years old, Deleon was beaten and abused, including 
multiple occasions on which his father shoved toothpicks under his fi ngernails. John senior was described 
by witnesses as a control freak, drug addict, and family abuser; he eventually died of AIDS.
As it turns out, the brutal murder of Tom and Jackie Hawks was not Deleon’s fi rst involvement with a 
capital crime. He was also convicted in the 2003 murder of John Jarvi, whom Deleon baited into traveling 
to Mexico for an easy-money business deal; once they arrived, Jarvi was robbed of $50,000, murdered, and 
his body left near a Mexican highway. And then there was the attempted murder of witnesses in the Hawks 
trial. Daniel Elias, a career criminal who met Deleon at the Orange County jail, later testifi ed that Deleon 
promised him $1 million if he killed witnesses in the upcoming trial. Another bizarre twist: while in prison 
Deleon attempted to sever his sexual organs, claiming that the robbery was merely a means to fund a sex 
change operation.1
C
Career criminals like Skylar Deleon defy what is com-
monly known about criminal behavior: they do not age 
out of crime as do most youthful offenders, but persist into 
their adulthood. Nor do they get involved in a single crime 
and then forgo illegal activity; they have a long history of 
antisocial behavior, continually planning and getting in-
volved in criminal acts of greater seriousness until they are 
captured and imprisoned. Criminologists have struggled 
to understand the factors that explain the onset and con-
tinuation of a criminal career. Rather than look at a single 
factor, such as poverty or low intelligence, and suggest that 
people who maintain this trait are predisposed to crime, 
those who engage in developmental criminology attempt 
to provide a more global vision of a criminal career en-
compassing its onset, continuation, and termination. This 
chapter reviews the most important issues in developmen-
tal criminology, and discusses major concepts and theories 
in some detail.

CHAPTER 9 | Developmental Theories: Life Course, Latent Trait, and Trajectory  297
John Laub, who used modern statistical techniques to rean-
alyze the Gluecks’ carefully drawn empirical measurements. 
Their fi ndings, published in a series of books and articles, 
fueled the popularity of what is now referred to as the life 
course approach.7
The critical Philadelphia cohort research by Mar-
vin Wolfgang and his associates was another milestone 
prompting interest in explaining criminal career devel-
opment.8 As you may recall, Wolfgang found that while 
many offenders commit a single criminal act and desist 
from crime, a small group of chronic offenders engage in 
frequent and repeated criminal activity and continue to do 
so across their life span. Wolfgang’s research focused atten-
tion on criminal careers. Criminologists were now asking 
this fundamental question: what prompts one person to 
engage in persistent criminal activity while another, who 
on the surface suffers the same life circumstances, fi nds 
a way to steer clear of crime and travel along a more con-
ventional path?
A 1990 review paper by Rolf Loeber and Marc LeBlanc 
was another important event that generated interest in de-
velopmental theory. In this landmark work, Loeber and 
LeBlanc proposed that criminologists should devote time 
and effort to understanding some basic questions about the 
evolution of criminal careers: Why do people begin com-
mitting antisocial acts? Why do some stop while others 
continue? Why do some escalate the severity of their crimi-
nality (that is, go from shoplifting to drug dealing to armed 
robbery) while others deescalate and commit less serious 
crimes as they mature? If some terminate their criminal ac-
tivity, what, if anything, causes them to begin again? Why do 
some criminals specialize in certain types of crime, whereas 
others are generalists engaging in a variety of antisocial be-
havior? According to Loeber and LeBlanc’s developmental 
view, criminologists must pay attention to how a criminal 
career unfolds, how it begins, why it is sustained, and how 
it comes to an end.9
Life Course, Latent Traits, 
and Trajectories
These scholarly advances created enormous excitement 
among criminologists and focused their attention on 
criminal career research. As research on criminal careers 
has evolved, three distinct viewpoints have taken shape: 
life course view, latent trait view, and trajectory view. Life 
course theory sees criminality as a dynamic process, in-
fl uenced by a multitude of individual characteristics, traits, 
and social experiences. As people travel through the life 
course, they are constantly bombarded by changing per-
ceptions and experiences, and as a result their behavior will 
change directions, sometimes for the better and sometimes 
for the worse (Figure 9.1). In contrast, latent trait theory
on the careers of known criminals to determine the factors 
that predicted persistent offending, making extensive use 
of interviews and records in their elaborate comparisons of 
criminals and noncriminals.
The Gluecks’ research focused on early onset of delin-
quency as a harbinger of a criminal career: “[T]he deeper 
the roots of childhood maladjustment, the smaller the 
chance of adult adjustment.”4 They also noted the stability 
of offending careers: children who are antisocial early in life 
are the most likely to continue their offending careers into 
adulthood.
The Gluecks identifi ed a number of personal and so-
cial factors related to persistent offending, the most im-
portant of which was family relations. This factor was 
considered in terms of quality of discipline and emotional 
ties with parents. The adolescent raised in a large, single-
parent family of limited economic means and educational 
achievement was the most vulnerable to delinquency. Not 
restricting their analysis to social variables, the Gluecks 
measured such biological and psychological traits as body 
type, intelligence, and personality, and found that physi-
cal and mental factors also played a role in determin-
ing behavior. Children with low intelligence, who had a 
background of mental disease, and who had a powerful 
(“mesomorph”) physique were the most likely to become 
persistent offenders.
Integrating biological, social, and psychological ele-
ments, the Gluecks’ research suggested that the initiation 
and continuity of a criminal career was a developmental 
process infl uenced by both internal and external situations, 
conditions, and circumstances. While impressive, their re-
search was heavily criticized by sociologists such as Edwin 
Sutherland who wanted to keep criminology within the fi eld 
of sociology and feared or disparaged efforts to integrate bi-
ological or psychological concepts into the fi eld.5
In a series of longitudinal research studies, the Gluecks 
followed the careers of known delinquents to determine the 
characteristics that predicted persistent offending.6
Social process theories lay the foundation for assuming 
that peer, family, educational, and other interactions, 
which vary over the life course, influence behaviors. 
See the fi rst few sections of Chapter 7 for a review of 
these issues. As you may recall from Chapter 2, a great 
deal of research has been conducted on the relationship 
of age and crime and the activities of chronic offenders. 
This scholarship has prompted interest in the life cycle 
of crime.

298  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
LIFE COURSE 
FUNDAMENTALS
According to the life course view, even as toddlers, people be-
gin relationships and behaviors that will determine their adult 
life course. At fi rst they must learn to conform to social rules 
and function effectively in society. Later they are expected to 
begin to think about careers, leave their parental homes, fi nd 
permanent relationships, and eventually marry and begin 
their own families.11 These transitions are expected to take 
place in order—beginning with fi nishing school, then enter-
ing the workforce, getting married, and having children.
Some individuals, however, are incapable of maturing in a 
reasonable and timely fashion because of family, environmen-
tal, or personal problems.12 In some cases, transitions can oc-
cur too early—an adolescent girl who engages in precocious 
sex gets pregnant and is forced to drop out of high school. In 
other cases, transitions may occur too late—a teenage male falls 
in with the wrong crowd, goes to prison, and fi nds it diffi cult 
to break into the job market upon release; he puts off getting 
married because of his diminished economic circumstances. 
Sometimes interruption of one tran-
sition can harm another. A teenager 
who has family problems may fi nd 
that her educational and career de-
velopment is upset or that she suffers 
from psychological impairments.13 
Because the shift from one stage of 
life to another can be a bumpy ride, 
the propensity to commit crimes is 
neither stable nor constant: it is a de-
velopmental process. A positive life 
experience may help some criminals 
desist from crime, whereas a negative 
one may cause them to resume their 
activities. Criminal careers are said 
to be developmental because people 
are constantly being influenced by 
the behavior of those around them, 
and they, in turn, influence others’ 
behavior. A youth’s antisocial behav-
ior may turn his more conventional 
friends against him; their rejection 
solidifi es and escalates his antisocial 
behavior.14
Disruption Promotes 
Criminality
Disruptions in life’s major tran-
sitions can be destructive and 
ultimately can promote criminal-
ity. Those who are already at risk 
holds that human development is controlled by a stable 
propensity or “master trait,” present at birth or soon after. 
As people travel through their life course, this trait is al-
ways there, directing their behavior and shaping the course 
of their life. Because this master trait is enduring, the ebb 
and fl ow of criminal behavior is directed by the impact of 
external forces such as interpersonal interactions and crim-
inal opportunity; though people don’t change, their oppor-
tunities and experiences do.
A third view, trajectory theory, suggests there are 
multiple trajectories in a criminal career. According to this 
approach, there are multiple subgroups within a popula-
tion that follow distinctively different developmental tra-
jectories that lead them toward a criminal career. Some 
people may begin early in antisocial activities and dem-
onstrate a propensity for crime, while others begin later 
and are infl uenced by life circumstances. This view sug-
gests that both the life course and latent trait visions may 
have validity because there are different types and classes 
of offenders.10
Each of these positions is discussed in detail in the fol-
lowing sections.

and variety depending on external
factors ranging from opportunity
to social control.

CHAPTER 9 | Developmental Theories: Life Course, Latent Trait, and Trajectory  299
Problem Behavior Syndrome
Most criminological theories portray crime as the outcome 
of social problems. Learning theorists view a troubled home 
life and deviant friends as precursors of criminality; struc-
tural theorists maintain that acquiring deviant cultural 
values leads to criminality. In contrast, the developmental 
view is that criminality may best be understood as one of 
many social problems faced by at-risk youth, a view called 
problem behavior syndrome (PBS). According to this 
view, crime is one among a group of interrelated antisocial 
behaviors that cluster together and typically involve family 
dysfunction, sexual and physical abuse, substance abuse, 
smoking, precocious sexuality and early pregnancy, educa-
tional underachievement, suicide attempts, sensation seek-
ing, and unemployment.23 People who suffer from one of 
these conditions typically exhibit many symptoms of the 
rest.24 All varieties of criminal behavior, including violence, 
theft, and drug offenses, may be part of a generalized PBS, 
indicating that all forms of antisocial behavior have similar 
developmental patterns (Exhibit 9.1).25
Many examples support the existence of PBS:26
Adolescents with a
 
■
 history of gang involvement are 
more likely to have been expelled from school, be binge 
drinkers, test positively for marijuana, have been in 
three or more fi ghts in the past six months, have non-
monogamous partners, and test positive for sexually 
transmitted diseases.27
Kids who gamble and take risks at an early age also take 
 
■
drugs and commit crimes.28
People who exhibit one of these conditions typically 
 
■
exhibit many of the others.29
Those who suffer from PBS are prone to more diffi culties 
than the general population.30 They fi nd themselves with a 
because of socioeconomic problems or family dysfunction 
are the most susceptible to these  awkward transitions. 
Criminality, according to this view, cannot be attributed 
to a single cause, nor does it rep resent a single underly-
ing tendency.15 People are infl uenced by different factors 
as they mature. Consequently, a factor that may have an 
important infl uence at one stage of life (such as delin-
quent peers) may have little infl uence later on.16
These negative life events can become cumulative: as 
people acquire more personal defi cits, the chances of ac-
quiring additional ones increases.17 The cumulative impact 
of these disruptions sustains criminality from childhood 
into adulthood.18
Changing Life Influences
Life course theories also recognize that as people mature, 
the factors that infl uence their behavior change.19 As people 
make important life transitions—from child to adolescent, 
from adolescent to adult, from unwed to married—the na-
ture of social interactions changes.20
At first, family relations may be most influential; it 
comes as no shock to life course theorists when research 
shows that criminality runs in families and that having 
criminal relatives is a signifi cant predictor of future mis-
behaviors.21 In later adolescence, school and peer relations 
predominate; in adulthood, vocational achievement and 
marital relations may be the most critical infl uences. Some 
antisocial children who are in trouble throughout their 
adolescence may manage to fi nd stable work and maintain 
intact marriages as adults; these life events help them desist 
from crime. In contrast, less fortunate adolescents who de-
velop arrest records and get involved with the wrong crowd 
may fi nd themselves limited to menial jobs and at risk for 
criminal careers.
LIFE COURSE CONCEPTS
A view of crime has emerged that incorporates personal 
change and growth. The factors that produce crime and de-
linquency at one point in the life cycle may not be relevant 
at another; as people mature, the social, physical, and en-
vironmental infl uences on their behavior are transformed. 
People may show a propensity to offend early in their lives, 
but the nature and frequency of their activities are often af-
fected by forces beyond their control, which elevate and 
sustain their criminal activity.22

they are much more likely to be troublesome and exhibit 
aggressive behavior in adulthood.44
Early-onset criminals seem to be more involved in ag-
gressive acts ranging from cruelty to animals to peer-di-
rected violence.45 In contrast, late starters are more likely 
to be involved in nonviolent crimes such as theft.46 Recent 
research by Daniel Nagin and Richard Tremblay shows that 
late-onset physical aggression is the exception, not the rule, 
and that the peak frequency of physical aggression occurs 
during early childhood and generally declines thereafter.47
Why is early onset so important? Starting early in delin-
quent behavior creates a downward spiral in a young per-
son’s life.48 Thereafter tension may begin to develop with 
parents and other family members, emotional bonds to 
conventional peers become weakened and frayed, and op-
portunities to pursue conventional activities like sports dry 
up and wither away. Replacing them are closer involvement 
with more deviant peers and involvement in a delinquent 
way of life.49 As they emerge into adulthood, persisters re-
port less emotional support, lower job satisfaction, distant 
peer relationships, and more psychiatric problems than 
those who desist.50
Continuity and Desistance What causes some kids to 
begin offending at an early age? Among the suspected root 
causes are poor parental discipline and monitoring, inad-
equate emotional support, distant peer relationships, and 
psychological issues and problems.51 The psychic scars of 
childhood are hard to erase.52
Children who are improperly socialized by unskilled 
parents are the most likely to rebel by wandering the streets 
with deviant peers.53 Parental infl uences may be replaced: 
in middle childhood, social rejection by conventional peers 
and academic failure sustains antisocial behavior; in later 
adolescence, commitment to a deviant peer group creates 
a training ground for crime. While the youngest and most 
serious offenders may persist in their criminal activity into 
late adolescence and even adulthood, others are able to age 
out of crime or desist.
Gender and Desistance As they mature, both males and 
females who have early experiences with antisocial behav-
ior are the ones most likely to persist throughout their life 
course. Like boys, early-onset girls continue to experience 
diffi culties—increased drug and alcohol use, poor school ad-
justment, mental health problems, poor sexual health, psy-
chiatric problems, higher rates of mortality, criminal behavior, 
insuffi cient parenting skills, relationship dysfunction, lower 
performance in academic and occupational environments, 
involvement with social service assistance, and adjustment 
problems—as they enter young adulthood and beyond.54
There are also some distinct gender differences. For 
males, the path runs from early onset in childhood to later 
problems at work and involvement with substance abuse. 
For females, the path seems somewhat different: early anti-
social behavior leads to relationship problems, depression, 
range of personal dilemmas ranging from drug abuse to be-
ing accident prone, requiring more health care and hospital-
ization, becoming teenage parents, or having mental health 
problems.31 PBS has been linked to individual-level person-
ality problems (such as impulsiveness, rebelliousness, and 
low ego), family problems (such as intrafamily confl ict and 
parental mental disorder), substance abuse, and educational 
failure.32 Research shows that social problems such as drug 
abuse, low income, aggression, single parenthood, residence 
in isolated urban areas, lack of family support or resources, 
racism, and prolonged exposure to poverty are all interre-
lated.33 Considering the types of problems that cluster to-
gether (e.g., mental illness, drug abuse, hospitalization), it is 
not surprising that people who have a long and varied crim-
inal career are more likely to die early and have greater than 
average mortality rates. Criminal conduct has been found to 
increase the chances of premature death due to both natural 
and unnatural causes, including deaths from accidents, ho-
micide, and suicide. The more crime a person commits, the 
more likely he or she is to suffer premature death.34
In sum, problem behavior syndrome portrays crime as 
a type of social problem rather than the product of other 
social problems.35 People involved in crime may fall prey 
to other social problems, ranging from poverty to prema-
ture death.36
Offense Specialization/Generalization
Some offenders are specialists, limiting their criminal activities 
to a cluster of crime such as theft offenses, including burglary 
and larceny, or violent offenses such as assault and rape.37 
Others are generalists who engage in a variety of criminal ac-
tivities such as drug abuse, burglary, and/or rape, depending 
on the opportunity to commit crime and the likelihood of 
success.38 There is an ongoing debate over generalization/spe-
cialization: some criminologists believe that most criminals 
are generalists, while others have found evidence that more 
serious offenders tend to specialize in a narrower range of an-
tisocial activities.39 The answer may lie in between these two 
positions; there is evidence for specialization, but it is neither 
overwhelming not universal.40 Some offenders may special-
ize in the short term but engage in a wider variety of offenses 
when presented with opportunities to commit crime.41
Age of Onset/Continuity of Crime
Most life course theories assume that the seeds of a criminal 
career are planted early in life and that early onset of devi-
ance strongly predicts later and more serious criminality.42 
Children who will later become the most serious delinquents 
begin their deviant careers at a very early (preschool) age, 
and the earlier the onset of criminality, the more frequent, 
varied, and sustained the criminal career.43 If children are 
aggressive and antisocial during their public school years,

relied on the data originally collected by the Gluecks more 
than 40 years before. Using modern statistical analysis, Laub 
and Sampson relied on this data to formulate a life course/
developmental view of crime.58 Some of the principles of 
age-graded theory are listed below:
Individual traits and childhood experiences are impor-
 
■
tant to understand the onset of delinquent and criminal 
behavior. But these alone cannot explain the continuity 
of crime into adulthood.
Experiences in young adulthood and beyond can redi-
 
■
rect criminal transitions. In some cases people can be 
turned in a positive direction, while in others negative 
life experiences can be harmful and injurious.
Repeat negative experiences create a condition called 
 
■
cumulative disadvantage. Serious problems in adoles-
cence undermine life chances and reduce employability 
and social relations. People who increase their cumula-
tive disadvantage risk continued offending.
a tendency to commit suicide, and poor health in adult-
hood.55 Males seem to be more deeply influenced by an 
early history of childhood aggression: males who exhibited 
chronic physical aggression during the elementary school 
years exhibit the risk of continued physical violence and 
delinquency during adolescence. There is less evidence of 
a linkage between childhood physical aggression and adult 
aggression among females.56
THEORIES OF THE CRIMINAL 
LIFE COURSE
A number of systematic theories have been formulated that 
account for onset, continuance, and desistance from crime. 
As a group they integrate societal level variables such as 
measures of social control, social learning, and structural 
models. It is not uncommon for life course theories to inter-
connect personal factors such as personality and intelligence, 
social factors such as income and neighborhood, socialization 
factors such as marriage and military service, cognitive factors 
such as information processing and attention/perception, 
and situational factors such as criminal opportunity, effective 
guardianship, and apprehension risk into complex multifac-
tor explanations of human behavior. In this sense they are 
integrated theories because they incorporate social, per-
sonal, and developmental factors into complex explanations 
of human behavior. They do not focus on the relatively sim-
ple question—why do people commit crime?—but on more 
complex issues: Why do some offenders persist in criminal 
careers while others desist from or alter their criminal activ-
ity as they mature?57 Why do some people continually esca-
late their criminal involvement, whereas others slow down 
and turn their lives around? Are all criminals similar in their 
offending patterns, or are there different types of offenders 
and paths to offending? Life course theorists want to know 
not only why people enter a criminal way of life, but why, 
once they do, they are able to alter the trajectory of their 
criminal involvement. One of the more important life course 
theories, Sampson and Laub’s age-graded theory, is set out 
below in some detail. Exhibit 9.2 outlines the principles of 
some other important life course theories.
Sampson and Laub: 
Age-Graded Theory
Most theories focus on why people get involved in crime. In 
an important 1993 work, Crime in the Making, Robert Samp-
son and John Laub instead focus on whether there are trails 
back to conformity. In formulating their Age-Graded Theory 
of Informal Social Control (Figure 9.2). Laub and Sampson 
High-priced call girl, drug abuser, identity thief—Audrey Atlas, 45, of

hope to other troubled women who think there is no hope. For now, at 
least, she is beating the odds. Shown here, a dinner/meeting at Pastor 
Lisa Cram’s house; Pastor Cram specializes in counseling women. 
What could cause a chronic offender such as Atlas to turn her life 
around and step off the criminal path?

Principal Life Course Theories
Name Social Development Model (SDM)
Principal Theorists J. David Hawkins, Richard Catalano
Major Premise Community-level risk factors make some 
people susceptible to antisocial behaviors. Preexisting risk 
factors are either reinforced or neutralized by socialization. To 
control the risk of antisocial behavior, a child must maintain 
prosocial bonds. Over the life course, involvement in prosocial 
or antisocial behavior determines the quality of attachments. 
Commitment and attachment to conventional institutions, 
activities, and beliefs insulate youths from the criminogenic 
influences in their environment. The prosocial path inhibits 
deviance by strengthening bonds to prosocial others and 
activities. Without the proper level of bonding, adolescents 
can succumb to the influence of deviant others.
Name Interactional Theory
Principal Theorists Terence Thornberry and Marvin Krohn, 
Alan Lizotte, Margaret Farnworth
Major Premise The onset of crime can be traced to a 
deterioration of the social bond during adolescence, marked 
by weakened attachment to parents, commitment to school, 
and belief in conventional values. The cause of crime and 
delinquency is bidirectional: weak bonds lead kids to develop 
friendships with deviant peers and get involved in delinquency. 
Frequent delinquency involvement further weakens bonds and 
makes it difficult to reestablish conventional ones. Delinquency-
promoting factors tend to reinforce one another and sustain a 
chronic criminal career. Kids who go through stressful life events 
such as a family financial crisis are more likely to later get 
involved in antisocial behaviors and vice versa. Criminality is 
a developmental process that takes on different meaning 
and form as a person matures. During early adolescence, 
attachment to the family is critical; by mid-adolescence, the 
influence of the family is replaced by friends, school, and youth 
culture; by adulthood, a person’s behavioral choices are shaped 
by his or her place in conventional society and his or her own 
nuclear family. Although crime is influenced by these social 
forces, it also influences these processes and associations. 
Therefore, crime and social processes are interactional.
Name General Theory of Crime and Delinquency (GTCD)
Principal Theorist Robert Agnew
Major Premise Crime and social relations are reciprocal. 
Family relationships, work experiences, school performance, 
and peer relations influence crime. In turn, antisocial acts have 
a significant impact on family relationships, work experiences, 
school performance, and peer relations. Engaging in crime 
leads to a weakened bond with significant others and 
strengthens the association with criminal peers. Close ties to 
criminal peers weakens bonds to conventional society.
Crime is most likely to occur when the constraints against 
crime (e.g., fear of punishment, stake in conformity, self-control) 
are low and the motivations for crime (e.g., beliefs favorable to 
crime, exposure to criminals, criminal learning experiences) 
are high. The way an individual reacts to constraints and 
motivations is shaped by five key elements of human 
development, called life domains:
Self. 
 
■
Irritability and/or low self-control.
Family.
 
■
 Poor parenting and no marriage or a bad marriage.
School. 
 
■
Negative school experiences and limited education.
Peers.
 
■
 Delinquent friends.
Work.
 
■
 Unemployment or having a bad job.
The structure and impact of each of the life domains is 
continuously evolving. Each has an influence over the others; 
they are mutually interdependent.

Positive life experiences and relationships can help a 
 
■
person become reattached to society and allow him or 
her to knife off from a criminal career path.
Positive life experiences such as gaining employment, 
 
■
getting married, or joining the military create informal 
social control mechanisms that limit criminal behavior 
opportunities. These elements of informal social control 
are called turning points in crime.
Two critical elements of informal social control/turning 
 
■
points are marriage and career. Adolescents who are 
at risk for crime can live conventional lives if they can 
fi nd good jobs, achieve successful military careers, or 
enter into a successful marriage. Turning points may be 
serendipitous and unexpected: success may hinge on a 
lucky break; someone takes a chance on them; they win 
the lottery.
Another vital feature that helps people desist from 
 
■
crime is “human agency” or the purposeful execution of 
choice and free will. Former delinquents may choose to 
go straight and develop a new sense of self and an iden-
tity. They can choose to desist from crime and become 
family men and hard workers.59
While some people persist in crime simply because they 
 
■
fi nd it lucrative or perhaps because it serves as an outlet 
for their frustrations, others choose not to participate 
because as human beings they fi nd other, more con-
ventional paths more benefi cial and rewarding. Human 
choice cannot be left out of the equation.

Laub and Sampson’s most important contributions is identi-
fying the life events that enable adult offenders to desist from

crime. According to them, trajectories are long-term patterns 
in life, while transitions are “short-term events embedded 
in trajectories.”60 Both transitions and trajectories can have 
a positive or negative connotation. A positive transition, for 
example, might include graduating from college and getting 
a good job; a negative trajectory might be joining a gang.
A major concept in the Sampson and Laub theory is that 
criminal careers are a dynamic process in which an important 
life event can (a) produce a transition in the life course, and 
(b) change the direction of a person’s life course trajectory; 
they refer to these as turning points. Two critical turning 
points are marriage and career. Adolescents who are at risk 
for crime can live conventional lives if they can fi nd good 
jobs or achieve successful careers. Even those who have been 
in trouble with the law may turn from crime if employers are 
willing to give them a chance despite their records.
Social Capital Social scientists recognize that people build 
social capital—positive relations with individuals and institu-
tions that are life sustaining. Laub and Sampson view the devel-
opment of social capital as essential for desistance. In the same 
manner that building fi nancial capital improves the chances for 
personal success, building social capital supports conventional 
behavior and inhibits deviant behavior. A successful marriage 
creates social capital when it improves a person’s stature, cre-
ates feelings of self-worth, and encourages people to trust the 
individual. A successful career inhibits crime by creating a 
stake in conformity; why commit crime when you are doing 
well at your job? The relationship is reciprocal. If people are 
chosen to be employees, they return the favor by doing the 
best job possible; if they are chosen as spouses, they blossom 
into devoted partners. In contrast, people who fail to accumu-
late social capital are more prone to commit  criminal acts.61

capital) while reducing criminal involvement.70 Simi-
larly, people who are fortunate enough to obtain high-
quality jobs are likely to reduce their criminal activities 
even if they had a prior history of offending.71
The Marriage Factor When they achieve adulthood, ado-
lescents who had signifi cant problems with the law are able 
to desist from crime if they can establish meaningful social 
ties that provide informal social control. Of these, none is 
more important than a successful marriage. People who 
cannot sustain secure marital relations are less likely to de-
sist from crime. People who can fi nd a spouse who supports 
them despite knowing about their past misdeeds are the ones 
most likely to steer away from the path of crime. Marriage 
both transforms people and reduces their opportunity to 
commit crimes. It helps cut off a person’s past, provides new 
relationships, creates new levels of supervision, and helps 
the former offender develop structured routines focused on 
family life. Happy marriages are life sustaining, and marital 
quality can even improve over time (as people work less and 
have fewer parental responsibilities).72 Spending time in 
marital and family activities also reduces exposure to devi-
ant peers, which in turn reduces the opportunity to become 
involved in criminal activities.73 As Mark Warr states:
For many individuals, it seems, marriage marks a tran-
sition from heavy peer involvement to a preoccupation 
with one’s spouse. That transition is likely to reduce 
interaction with former friends and accomplices and 
thereby reduce the opportunities as well as the motiva-
tion to engage in crime.74
Even people who have histories of criminal activity and 
have been convicted of serious offenses reduce the frequency 
of their offending if they live with spouses and maintain em-
ployment when they are in the community (see The Crimi-
nological Enterprise feature titled “Love, Sex, Marriage, 
and Crime”).75 The marriage benefi t may also be intergen-
erational: children who grow up in two-parent families are 
more likely to later have happy marriages themselves than 
children who are the product of divorced or never-married 
parents.76 If people with marital problems are more crime 
prone, their children will also suffer a greater long-term risk 
of marital failure and antisocial activity.
Future Research Directions Although age-graded the-
ory has received enormous attention, there are still many 
research questions left unanswered. For example, what is 
it about a military career that helps reduce future crimi-
nality? Does the connection between military service and 
desistance suggest universal military service as a crime pre-
vention alternative? Why are some troubled youths able to 
conform to the requirements of a job or career while others 
cannot? If acquiring social capital—family, friends, educa-
tion, marriage, and employment—aids in the successful re-
covery from crime, does the effect produce an actual change 
in the propensity to commit crime or merely the reduction 
of criminal opportunity?77
The fact that social capital infl uences the trajectory of a 
criminal career underscores the life course view that events 
that occur in later adolescence and adulthood do in fact 
infl uence behavior choices. Life events that occur in adult-
hood can help either terminate or sustain deviant careers.
Testing Age-Graded Theory There have been a number 
of research efforts that have supported the basic assump-
tions of age-graded theory:
Empirical research now shows that, as predicted by 
 
■
Sampson and Laub, people change over the life course 
and that the factors that predict delinquency in adoles-
cence, such as a weak bond to parents, may have less 
of an impact on adult crime when other factors, such as 
marriage and family, take on greater importance.62
Criminality appears to be dynamic and is affected both 
 
■
by the erosion of informal social control and by interac-
tion with antisocial infl uences. For example, accumulat-
ing deviant peers helps sustain criminality: the more 
deviant friends one accumulates over time, the more 
likely one is to maintain a criminal career.63
As levels of cumulative disadvantage increase, crime-
 
■
resisting elements of social life are impaired. Adoles-
cents who are convicted of crime at an early age are 
more likely to develop antisocial attitudes later in life. 
They later develop low educational achievement, de-
clining occupational status, and unstable employment 
records.64 People who get involved with the justice 
system as adolescents may fi nd that their career paths 
are blocked well into adulthood.65 The relationship 
is reciprocal: men who are unemployed or underem-
ployed report higher criminal participation rates than 
employed men.66
Evidence is also available that confi rms Sampson and 
 
■
Laub’s suspicion that criminal career trajectories can be 
reversed if life conditions improve and they gain social 
capital.67 Kids who have long-term exposure to poverty 
fi nd that their involvement in crime escalates. Those, 
however, whose life circumstances improve because 
their parents are able to escape poverty and move to 
more attractive environments fi nd that they can be re-
leased from criminal trajectories. Relocating may place 
them in better educational environments where they 
can have a positive high school experience, facilitated 
by occupationally oriented course work, small class 
size, and positive peer climates. Such children are 
less likely to become incarcerated as adults than those 
who do not enjoy these social benefi ts.68 Research by 
Ross Macmillan and his colleagues shows that children 
whose mothers were initially poor but escaped from 
poverty were no more likely to develop behavior prob-
lems than children whose mothers were never poor.
Gaining social capital later in life helps erase some of the 
 
■
damage caused by its absence in youth.69 Delinquents 
who enter the military, serve overseas, and receive vet-
erans’ benefi ts enhance their occupational status (social

task is to determine whether the theory’s basic premises are 
still valid considering these structural changes in society. Re-
cent research by Ryan Schroeder and his colleagues show 
that getting involved in the drug culture has a much more 
damaging effect on marriage and employment than heavy al-
cohol abuse.78 Similarly, joining the military today may have 
a signifi cantly different meaning and produce signifi cantly 
different effects than it did for the men in the Glueck sam-
ple: recent research indicates that the 12-month prevalence 
of common mental illnesses in the United States military is 
Probably the most important issue that must be ad-
dressed is whether the relationships that underpin age-
graded theory are still valid today. Laub and Sampson’s 
theory relies heavily on the Glueck data collected more than 
50 years ago. The Glueck sample lived in a world that was 
quite different from contemporary society: they did not 
watch violent video games or TV shows; they used alcohol 
but were not part of a drug culture; marriage was the norm 
and the divorce rate was much lower; globalization and 
wide-scale job loss were not issues. An important research 
offenders were far less likely to return to 
crime if they settled down into the routines 
of a solid marriage. People who get mar-
ried are more likely to have nine-to-five 
jobs, come home for dinner, take care of 
children if they have them, watch televi-
sion, go to bed, and repeat that cycle over 
and over again. Single people have a lot of 
free time to do what they want, especially 
if they are not employed. There’s some-
thing about crossing the line of getting 
married that helps these men stay away 
from crime.
Marriage may also mark a physical/
biological turning point in the life course. 
Kevin Beaver and his colleagues find that 
as people mature and go through biological 
changes, they slow down, prompting them 
to quit the hectic and strenuous criminal 
way of life and instead settling into a more 
comfortable and less taxing marital routine.
Why Do People Have Happy Marriages?
Because the marriage benefit is so great 
and long-lasting, it is troubling that so many 
marriages do not succeed; an estimated 
40 to 50 percent of first marriages, 67 per-
cent of second marriages, and 74 percent 
of third marriages end in divorce. Sociolo-
gist Rand Conger and his colleagues have 
discovered that the seeds of divorce are 
planted early in childhood: kids who grow 
up with warm, nurturing parents are the 
ones most likely to have intact marriages. 
Well-nurtured kids develop into warm and 
supportive marital partners who produce 
marriages that are happy, satisfying, and 
likely to endure. The quality of the parents’ 
marital relationship had no direct influence 
on the young adult romantic relationship: it 
is the quality of parenting and not the ob-
servation of adult romantic relations that 
socializes a young person to engage in 
behaviors likely to promote successful and 
lasting romantic unions as an adult.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Do you think that marriage is different 
than merely being in love? While the Mc-
Carthy and Casey research indicates that 
having a romantic relationship may help 
reduce crime, can marriage work better?
 2. Even if we can show that married peo-
ple are less likely to commit crime, does 
that fact prove that getting married is 
a cause of desistance? Isn’t it possible 
that people who have given up antiso-
cial behaviors are ready to get married 
and make more attractive mates?

Love, Sex, Marriage, and Crime
Is it marriage or the promise of romantic 
love to which it is attached that protects 
people from crime? When sociologists Bill 
McCarthy and Teresa Casey examined the 
association between love, sex, and delin-
quency in a sample of teens, they found 
that the closeness offered by adolescent 
romantic love may fill an important void 
found between the weakening of bonds 
with parents and the onset of adult attach-
ments, and it may discourage an array of 
negative outcomes, including involvement 
in crime. Adolescent sexual activity without 
the promise of love increases the likelihood 
of offending because it is associated with 
strain created by loveless relationships. Mc-
Carthy and Casey find that romantic love 
has a deterrent effect that actually encour-
ages youth who have offended to decrease 
their involvement in crime. It is possible, 
they speculate, that romantic love discour-
ages offending by strengthening the social 
bond. By contrast, the association between 
sex and crime is intensified in relationships 
short on love. It is possible that kids who 
engage in sex without love or romance are 
willing to partake in other risky and/or self-
indulgent behaviors, including delinquency 
and drug usage. The McCarthy/Casey re-
search indicates that while marriage may 
help at-risk people knife off from crime, 
falling in love with a romantic partner may 
work just as well.

Donald, and Karen Parker tracked 524 
men in their late teens and early 20s for

who survived to age 50, 24 percent had no 
arrests for delinquent acts of violence and 
property after age 17 (6 percent had no ar-
rests for total delinquency); 48 percent had 
no arrests for predatory delinquency after 
age 25 (19 percent for total delinquency); 
60 percent had no arrests for predatory 
delinquency after age 31 (33 percent for 
total delinquency); and 79 percent had no 
arrests for predatory delinquency after age 
40 (57 percent for total delinquency). They 
conclude that desistance from delinquency 
is the norm and that most, if not all, serious 
delinquents desist from delinquency.
Why Do Delinquents Desist?
Laub and Sampson’s earlier research indi-
cated that building social capital through 
marriage and jobs was a key component of 
desistance from delinquency. However, in 
this new round of research, Laub and Samp-
son were able to find out more about long-
term desistance by interviewing 52 men 
as they approached age 70. The follow-up 
showed a dramatic drop in criminal activ-
ity as the men aged. Between the ages of 
17 and 24, 84 percent of the subjects had 
committed violent crimes; in their 30s and 
40s, that number dropped to 14 percent; 
it fell to just 3 percent as the men reached 
their 60s and 70s. Property crimes and al-
cohol- and drug-related crimes also showed 
significant decreases. They found that men 
who desisted from crime were rooted in 
structural routines and had strong social 
ties to family and community. Drawing on 
the men’s own words, they found that one 
important element for “going straight” is the 
“knifing off” of individuals from their imme-
diate environment and offering the men a 
new script for the future. Joining the military 
can provide this knifing-off effect, as does 
marriage or changing one’s residence. One 
former delinquent (age 69) told them:
I’d say the turning point was, number 
one, the Army. You get into an outfi t, 
you had a sense of belonging, you 
made your friends. I think I became a 
pretty good judge of character. In the 
Army, you met some good ones, you 
met some foul balls. Then I met the 
wife. I’d say probably that would be 
the turning point. Got married, then 
naturally, kids come. So now you got to 
get a better job, you got to make more 
money. And that’s how I got to the 
Navy Yard and tried to improve myself.
Former delinquents who went straight 
were able to put structure into their lives. 
Structure often led the men to disassociate 
from delinquent peers, reducing the oppor-
tunity to get into trouble. Getting married, 
for example, may limit the number of nights 
men can “hang with the guys.” As one wife 
Shared Beginnings, Divergent Lives
Why are some delinquents destined to be-
come persistent criminals as adults? John 
Laub and Robert Sampson have conducted 
a follow-up to their reanalysis of Sheldon 
Glueck and Eleanor Glueck’s study that 
matched 500 delinquent boys with 500 
nondelinquents. The individuals in the 
original sample were reinterviewed by the 
Gluecks at ages 25 and 32. Sampson and 
Laub located and interviewed the survivors 
of the delinquent sample, the oldest 70 
years old and the youngest 62.
Persistence and Desistance
Laub and Sampson find that delinquency and 
other forms of antisocial conduct in childhood 
are strongly related to adult delinquency and 
drug and alcohol abuse. Former delinquents 
also suffer consequences in other areas of 
social life, such as school, work, and fam-
ily life. For example, delinquents are far less 
likely to finish high school than are nondelin-
quents and subsequently are more likely to 
be unemployed, receive welfare, and experi-
ence separation or divorce as adults.
In their latest research, Laub and Samp-
son address one of the key questions posed 
by life course theories: is it possible for for-
mer delinquents to turn their lives around 
as adults? They find that most antisocial 
children do not remain antisocial as adults. 
For example, of men in the study cohort

estimated to be 26 percent, far above the level in the civil-
ian population. Considering this condition, it is diffi cult to 
believe that serving in the military today has the same effect 
it did 60 years ago.79
To answer some of these questions, Laub and Samp-
son contacted the surviving members of the Glueck 
cohort. Some of their fi ndings are discussed in The Crim-
inological Enterprise feature “Shared Beginnings, Diver-
gent Lives.”

LATENT TRAIT THEORIES
In a critical 1990 article, David Rowe, D. Wayne Osgood, 
and W. Alan Nicewander proposed the concept of latent 
traits to explain the fl ow of crime over the life cycle. Their 
model assumes that a number of people in the population 
have a personal attribute or characteristic that controls their 
inclination or propensity to commit crimes.80 This disposi-
tion, or latent trait, may be either present at birth or es-
tablished early in life, and it can remain stable over time. 
Suspected latent traits include defective intelligence, dam-
aged or impulsive personality, genetic abnormalities, the 
physical-chemical functioning of the brain, and environmen-
tal infl uences on brain function such as drugs, chemicals,

and injuries.81 Some latent trait theorists maintain that this 
master trait is infl exible, stable, and unchanging throughout 
a person’s lifetime, while others recognize that under some 
circumstances a latent trait can be altered, infl uenced, or 
changed by experiences and interactions (Exhibit 9.3).
Regardless of gender or environment, those who possess 
one of these suspect traits may be at risk to crime and in dan-
ger of becoming career criminals; those who lack the traits 
have a much lower risk.82 Because latent traits are stable, 
people who are antisocial during adolescence are the most 
likely to persist in crime. The positive association between 
past and future criminality detected in the cohort studies 
of career criminals refl ects the presence of this underlying 
unnatural death. So while many troubled 
youth are able to reform, their early excesses 
may haunt them across their life span.
Policy Implications
Laub and Sampson find that youth prob-
lems—delinquency, substance abuse, vio-
lence, dropping out, teen pregnancy—often 
share common risk characteristics. Interven-
tion strategies, therefore, should consider a 
broad array of antisocial, criminal, and devi-
ant behaviors and not limit the focus to just 
one subgroup or delinquency type. Because 
criminality and other social problems are 
linked, early prevention efforts that reduce 
delinquency will probably also reduce alco-
hol abuse, drunk driving, drug abuse, sexual 
promiscuity, and family violence. The best 
way to achieve these goals is through four 
significant life-changing events: marriage, 
joining the military, getting a job, and chang-
ing one’s environment or neighborhood. 
What appears to be important about these 
processes is that they all involve, to varying 
degrees, the following items: a knifing off of 
the past from the present; new situations 
that provide both supervision and monitoring 
as well as new opportunities of social support 
and growth; and new situations that provide 
the opportunity for transforming identity. 
Prevention of delinquency must be a policy 
at all times and at all stages of life.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Do you believe that the factors that in-
fluenced the men in the original Glueck 
sample are still relevant for change? For 
example, considering the high current 
divorce rate, is marriage still a stabiliz-
ing force?
 2. Recent reports show that male U.S. 
veterans are twice as likely to die by 
suicide than people with no military 
service, and are more likely to kill 
themselves with a gun than others who 
commit suicide. Considering this recent 
finding, do you agree with Laub and 
Sampson that military service might be 
beneficial and help troubled kids turn 
their lives around?

of a former delinquent said, “It is not how 
many beers you have, it’s who you drink 
with.” Even multiple offenders who did time 
in prison were able to desist with the help of 
a stabilizing marriage.
Former delinquents who can turn their 
life around, who have acquired a degree 
of maturity by taking on family and work 
responsibilities, and who have forged new 
commitments are the ones most likely to 
make a fresh start and find new direction 
and meaning in life. It seems that men who 
desisted changed their identity as well, 
and this, in turn, affected their outlook and 
sense of maturity and responsibility. The 
ability to change did not reflect delinquency 
“specialty”: violent offenders followed the 
same path as property offenders.
While many former delinquents desisted 
from delinquency, they still faced the risk of 
an early and untimely death. Thirteen per-

to only 6 percent (N=28) of the nondelin-
quent subjects died unnatural deaths such 
as violence, cirrhosis of the liver caused by

on. By age 65, 29 percent (N=139) of the

ural causes. Frequent delinquent involve-
ment in adolescence and alcohol abuse

308  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Crime and Human Nature
Latent trait theorists were encouraged when two prominent 
social scientists, James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein, 
published Crime and Human Nature in 1985 and suggested 
that personal traits—such as genetic makeup, intelligence, 
and body build—may outweigh the importance of social 
variables as predictors of criminal activity.84
According to Wilson and Herrnstein, all human behav-
ior, including criminality, is determined by its perceived con-
sequences. A criminal incident occurs when an individual 
chooses criminal over conventional behavior (referred to as 
noncrime) after weighing the potential gains and losses of each: 
“The larger the ratio of net rewards of crime to the net rewards 
of noncrime, the greater the tendency to commit the crime.”85
Wilson and Herrnstein’s model assumes that both biolog-
ical and psychological traits infl uence the crime–noncrime 
choice. They see a close link between a person’s decision to 
choose crime and such biosocial factors as low intelligence, 
mesomorphic body type, genetic infl uences (parental crimi-
nality), and possessing an autonomic nervous system that 
responds too quickly to stimuli. Psychological traits, such as 
an impulsive or extroverted personality or generalized hos-
tility, also determine the potential to commit crime.
In their focus on the association between these consti-
tutional and psychological factors and crime, Wilson and 
Herrnstein seem to be suggesting the existence of an elusive 
latent trait that predisposes people to commit crime.86 Their 
vision helped inspire other criminologists to identify the elu-
sive latent trait that causes criminal behavior. The most prom-
inent latent trait theory is Gottfredson and Hirschi’s General 
Theory of Crime (GTC). Exhibit 9.4 discusses some other 
important contributions to the latent trait model.
General Theory of Crime
In their important work A General Theory of Crime, Michael 
Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi link the propensity to com-
mit crime to two latent traits: an impulsive personality and a 
lack of self-control.87
Gottfredson and Hirschi attribute the tendency to com-
mit crimes to a person’s level of self-control. People with 
limited self-control tend to be impulsive; they are insensitive 
to other people’s feelings, physical (rather than mental), risk 
takers, shortsighted, and nonverbal.88 They have a here-and-
now orientation and refuse to work for distant goals; they 
lack diligence, tenacity, and persistence. People lacking self-
control tend to be adventuresome, active, and self-centered. 
As they mature, they often have unstable marriages, jobs, and 
friendships.89 They are less likely to feel shame if they engage 
in deviant acts and are more likely to fi nd them pleasurable.90 
They are also more likely to engage in dangerous behaviors 
such as drinking, smoking, and reckless driving; all of these 
behaviors are associated with criminality (see  Exhibit 9.5 for 
a list of factors that indicate low self-control).91
stable criminal propensity. That is, if an impulsive personal-
ity contributes to delinquency in childhood, it should also 
cause the same people to offend as adults because personal-
ity traits remain stable over the life span.
How Can the Aging Out Process Be Explained? Be-
cause latent traits are stable, people who are antisocial dur-
ing adolescence are the most likely to persist in crime. The 
positive association between past and future criminality de-
tected in the cohort studies of career criminals refl ects the 
presence of this underlying stable criminal propensity. That 
is, if an impulsive personality contributes to delinquency in 
childhood, it should also cause the same people to offend as 
adults because personality traits remain stable over the life 
span. According to the concept of state dependence, kids 
who have the propensity to commit crime will fi nd that this 
latent trait profoundly and permanently disrupts normal so-
cialization. Disruptions in socialization thereafter increase 
the risk of prolonged antisocial behavior. In this view, early 
rule breaking increases the probability of future rule break-
ing because it weakens inhibitions to crime and strengthens 
criminal motivation. In other words, once kids get a taste of 
antisocial behavior, they like it and want to continue down 
a deviant path 83
How then can a latent trait theorist explain the well-
known fact that people do commit less crime as they mature? 
It’s possible that declining criminal activity may not be a valid 
indicator of real behavioral change. Why does this illusion ex-
ist? Whereas the propensity to commit crime is stable, the op-
portunity to commit crime fl uctuates over time. People may 
appear to age out of crime as they mature and develop simply 
because there are fewer opportunities to commit crimes and 
greater inducements to remain straight. They may marry, have 
children, and obtain jobs. The former delinquents’ newfound 
adult responsibilities leave them little time to hang with their 
friends, abuse substances, and get into scrapes with the law. 
So while their propensity to commit crime remains stable, 
their opportunity to commit crime has changed.
To understand this concept of stable criminal propensity 
better, assume that intelligence as measured by IQ tests is a 
stable latent trait associated with crime. Intelligence remains 
stable and unchanging over the life course, but crime rates 
decline with age. How can latent trait theory explain this 
phenomenon? Teenagers have more opportunity to commit 
crime than adults, so at every level of intelligence, adolescent 
crime rates will be higher. As they mature, however, teens 
with both high and low IQs will commit less crime because 
their adult responsibilities provide them with fewer criminal 
opportunities. They may get married and raise a family, get 
a job, and buy a home. And like most people, as they age 
they lose strength and vigor, qualities necessary to commit 
crime. Though their IQ remains stable and their propensity 
to commit crime is unchanged, their living environment and 
physical condition have undergone radical change. Even if 
they wanted to engage in criminal activities, the former de-
linquents may lack the opportunity and energy to do so.

CHAPTER 9 | Developmental Theories: Life Course, Latent Trait, and Trajectory  309
In his original version of control theory, discussed in 
Chapter 7, Hirschi focused on the social controls that 
attach people to conventional society and insulate them 
from criminality. In this newer work, he concentrates 
on self-control as a stabilizing force. The two views are 
connected, however, because both social control (or so-
cial bonds) and self-control are acquired through early 
experiences with effective parenting.
CONNECTIONS
Because those with low self-control enjoy risky, excit-
ing, or thrilling behaviors with immediate gratifi cation, they 
are more likely to enjoy criminal acts, which require stealth, 
agility, speed, and power, than conventional acts, which de-
mand long-term study and cognitive and verbal skills. As 
Gottfredson and Hirschi put it, they derive satisfaction from 
“money without work, sex without courtship, revenge with-
out court delays.”92 Many of these individuals who have a 
propensity for committing crime also engage in other risky, 
impulsive behaviors such as smoking, drinking, gambling, 
and illicit sexuality.93 Although these acts are not illegal, 
they too provide immediate, short-term gratifi cation.

Some Important Latent Trait Theories
Name Integrated Cognitive Antisocial Potential (ICAP) Theory
Principal Theorist David Farrington
Latent Trait Antisocial potential
Major Premise People maintain a range of antisocial potential 
(AP), the potential to commit antisocial acts. AP can be viewed 
as both a long- and short-term phenomenon. Those with high 
levels of long-term AP are at risk for offending over the life 
course; those with low AP levels live more conventional lives. 
Though AP levels are fairly consistent over time, they peak in 
the teenage years because of the effects of maturational 
factors—such as increase in peer influence and decrease in 
family influence—that directly affect crime rates. Long-term 
AP can be reduced by life-changing events such as marriage. 
There is also short-term AP when immediate life events 
may increase a personal antisocial potential so that, in the 
immediate moment, people may advance their location on 
the AP continuum. For example, a person with a relatively 
low long-term AP may suffer a temporary amplification if he 
is bored, angry, drunk, or frustrated. According to the ICAP 
theory, the commission of offenses and other types of 
antisocial acts depends on the interaction between the 
individual (with his immediate level of AP) and the social 
environment (especially criminal opportunities and victims).
Name Differential Coercion Theory
Principal Theorist Mark Colvin
Latent Trait Perceptions of coercion
Major Premise Perceptions of coercion begin early in life when 
children experience punitive forms of discipline—both physical 
attacks and psychological coercion, including negative 
commands, critical remarks, teasing, humiliation, whining, yelling, 
and threats. Through these destructive family interchanges, 
coercion becomes ingrained and guides reactions to adverse 
situations that arise in both family and nonfamily settings.
 There are two sources of coercion: interpersonal and 
impersonal. Interpersonal coercion is direct, involving the use 
or threat of force and intimidation from parents, peers, and 
significant others. Impersonal coercion involves pressures 
beyond individual control, such as economic and social 
pressure caused by unemployment, poverty, or competition 
among businesses or other groups. High levels of coercion 
produce criminality, especially when the episodes of coercive 
behavior are inconsistent and random, because this teaches 
people that they cannot control their lives. Chronic offenders 
grew up in homes where parents used erratic control and 
applied it in an inconsistent fashion.
Name Control Balance Theory
Principal Theorist Charles Tittle
Latent Trait Control/balance
Major Premise The concept of control has two distinct 
elements: the amount of control one is subject to by others and 
the amount of control one can exercise over others. Conformity 
results when these two elements are in balance; control 
imbalances produce deviant and criminal behaviors.
 Those people who sense a deficit of control turn to three 
types of behavior to restore balance:
Predation 
 
■
involves direct forms of physical violence, such as 
robbery, sexual assault, or other forms of assault.
Defiance 
 
■
challenges control mechanisms but stops short of 
physical harm: for example, vandalism, curfew violations, and 
unconventional sex.
Submission
 
■
 involves passive obedience to the demands 
of others, such as submitting to physical or sexual abuse 
without response.
 An excess of control can result in crimes of (a) exploitation, 
which involves using others to commit crimes, such as 
contract killers or drug runners, (b) plunder, which involves 
using power without regard for others, such as committing a 
hate crime or polluting the environment, or (c) decadence, 
which involves spur of the moment, irrational acts such as 
child molesting.

310  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
What Causes Impulsivity? Gottfredson and Hirschi trace 
the root cause of poor self-control to inadequate childrear-
ing practices that begin soon after birth and can infl uence 
neural development. Once experiences are ingrained, the 
brain establishes a pattern of electrochemical activation that 
remains for life.94 Parents who refuse or are unable to moni-
tor a child’s behavior, to recognize deviant behavior when it 
occurs, and to punish that behavior will produce children 
who lack self-control. Children who are not attached to their 
parents, who are poorly supervised, and whose parents are 
criminal or deviant themselves are the most likely to develop 
poor self-control. In a sense, lack of self-control occurs nat-
urally when steps are not taken to stop its development.95
The “poor parenting produces low self-control children” 
model may be intergenerational: parents who themselves 
manifest low self-control are the ones most likely to use 
damaging and inappropriate supervision and punishment 
mechanisms, such as corporal punishment. Inappropriate 
discipline modes have been linked to lack of self-control in 
adolescence. These impulsive kids grow up to become poor 
parents, who use improper discipline, and produce another 
generation of impulsive kids.96
Learning or Biology? While the General Theory assumes 
self-control is a function of socialization and parenting, 
some criminologists maintain it may also have a biological 
basis. Measures of neuropsychological defi cits, birth com-
plications, and low birth weight have all been found to 
have signifi cant direct or indirect effects on levels of self-
control.97 Recent research shows that children who suffer 
anoxia (oxygen starvation) during birth are the ones most 
likely to lack self-control later in life, suggesting that impul-
sivity may have a biological basis.98 When Kevin Beaver and 
his associates examined impulsive personality and self-con-
trol in twin pairs, they discovered evidence that these traits 
may be inherited rather than developed. That might explain 
the stability of these latent traits over the life course.99
Crime Rate Variations If individual differences are stable 
over the life course, why do crime rates vary? Why do people 
commit less crime as they age? Why are some regions more 
crime prone than others? Why are some groups more crime 
prone than others? Does that mean there are between-group 
differences in self-control? If male crime rates are higher than 
female rates, does that mean men are more impulsive and lack-
ing in self-control? How does the GTC address these issues?
Gottfredson and Hirschi remind us that criminal propen-
sity and criminal acts are separate concepts (Figure 9.3). On 
the one hand, criminal acts, such as robberies or burglaries, 
are illegal events or deeds that offenders engage in when they 
perceive them to be advantageous. Burglaries are typically 
committed by young males looking for cash, liquor, and 
entertainment; the crime provides “easy, short-term gratifi -
cation.”100 Crime is rational and predictable; people commit 
crime when it promises rewards with minimal threat of pain; 
the threat of punishment can deter crime. If targets are well

According to Gottfredson and Hirschi’s General Theory of Crime, 
impulsive teens who lack self-control are the ones most often involved 
in crime. Even if they do not violate the law, they may be risk takers 
who engage in such hazardous behaviors as drinking, precocious 
sexuality, smoking, and gambling.

Environment and Impulsivity The effects of impulsiv-
ity and environment may interact in other ways. Recently, 
criminologist Gregory Zimmerman examined how environ-
ment and personality interact and found that the effect of 
impulsivity and low self-control is actually suppressed in 
criminogenic environments, but encouraged in areas where 
the social push toward crime is minimized. How can this 
surprising fi nding be explained? In disadvantaged neighbor-
hoods, individuals tend to possess a feeling of fatalism and 
adopt a “nothing to lose” attitude. These factors cause both 
nonimpulsive and impulsive individuals to take advantage 
of criminal opportunities. In high-crime neighborhoods, 
everyone commits crime, regardless of personality dimen-
sions. Even if they can control their criminal urges, people 
fear losing respect if they choose not to offend. In contrast, 
in high-income, low-crime areas, nonimpulsive people are 
better able to conform, while those lacking self-control are 
immune from community-level informal social control and 
collective effi cacy. According to Zimmerman’s research, as 
neighborhood affl uence and organization increase, the in-
fl uence of low self-control becomes greater!102

Self-Control and Crime Gottfredson and Hirschi claim 
that the principles of self-control theory can explain all va-
rieties of criminal behavior and all the social and behavioral 
correlates of crime. That is, such widely disparate crimes 
as burglary, robbery, embezzlement, drug dealing, murder, 
rape, and insider trading all stem from a defi ciency of self-
control. Likewise, gender, racial, and ecological differences 
in crime rates can be explained by discrepancies in self-
control.
guarded, crime rates diminish. Only the truly irrational of-
fender would dare to strike under those circumstances.
On the other hand, while criminal offenders are people 
predisposed to commit crimes, they are not robots who com-
mit crime without restraint; their days are also fi lled with 
conventional behaviors, such as going to school, parties, 
concerts, and church. But given the same set of criminal op-
portunities, such as having a lot of free time for mischief and 
living in a neighborhood with unguarded homes contain-
ing valuable merchandise, crime-prone people have a much 
higher probability of violating the law than do noncriminals. 
The propensity to commit crimes remains stable throughout 
a person’s life. Change in the frequency of criminal activity 
is purely a function of change in criminal opportunity.
If we accept this provision of the GTC, then both crimi-
nal propensity and criminal opportunity must be considered 
to explain criminal participation. So if males and females are 
equally impulsive but their crime rates vary, the explanation 
is that males have more opportunity to commit crime. Young 
teenage girls may be more closely monitored by their parents 
and therefore lack the freedom to offend. Girls are also social-
ized to have more self-control than boys: although females 
get angry as often as males, many have been taught to blame 
themselves for such feelings. Females are socialized to fear that 
anger will harm relationships; males are encouraged to react 
with “moral outrage,” blaming others for their discomfort.101
Opportunity can also be used to explain ecological vari-
ation in the crime rate. How does the GTC explain the fact 
that crime rates are higher in the summer than the winter? 
The number of impulsive people lacking in self-control is 
no higher in August than it is in December. Gottfredson and 
Hirschi would argue that seasonal differences are explained 
by opportunity: during the summer kids are out of school 
and have more opportunity to commit crime. Similarly, if 
crime rates are higher in Los Angeles than Minneapolis, it is 
because either there are more criminal opportunities in this 
western city, or because the fast-paced life of L.A. attracts 
more impulsive people than the laid-back Midwest.

attempted to test the validity of Gottfredson and Hirschi’s 
theoretical views.103 The general consensus of this research 
is that people with low self-control and poor impulse con-
trol are the most likely to engage in serious crime.104
One approach has been to identify indicators of impul-
siveness and self-control to determine whether these factors 
correlate with measures of criminal activity. As a group they 
suggest that the lower a person’s self-control, the more likely 
they are to engage in antisocial behaviors.105 The lack of self-
control may begin early in adolescence and be manifested in 
aggressive behavior that turn kids into school yard bullies. 
Aggressive bullies are rejected by other kids, marginalized, 
and prone to school failure, a path that winds up in a delin-
quent way of life.106
Recently, for example, Matt Delisi and Michael Vaughn 
examined the association between low self-control and 
criminal careers.107 They found that compared to non-career 
offenders, career criminals had signifi cantly lower levels of 
self-control and that the lower the level of a person’s self-
control, the greater his or her chance of becoming a career 
criminal. Importantly, Delisi and Vaughn discovered that low 
self-control was by far the strongest predictor of career crimi-
nality, exceeding the impact of age, race, ethnicity, gender, 
socioeconomic status, mental illness, attention defi cit hyper-
activity disorder diagnosis, and trauma experience. More-
over, when Alexander Vazsonyi and his associates analyzed 
self-control and deviant behavior in samples drawn from a 
number of different countries (Hungary, Switzerland, the 
Netherlands, the United States, and Japan), they found that 
low self-control is signifi cantly related to antisocial behavior 
and that the association can be seen regardless of culture or 
national settings.108 Showing that the self-control–crime as-
sociation is invariant across cultures is a signifi cant contri-
bution to supporting its validity. These results lend strong 
support to the GTC. Gottfredson and Hirschi’s view has be-
come a cornerstone of contemporary criminological theory.
Analyzing the General Theory of Crime By integrating 
the concepts of socialization and criminality, Gottfredson and 
Hirschi help explain why some people who lack self-control 
can escape criminality, and, conversely, why some people 
who have self-control might not escape. People who are at 
risk because they have impulsive personalities may forgo 
criminal careers because there are no criminal opportuni-
ties that satisfy their impulsive needs; instead, they may fi nd 
other outlets for their impulsive personalities. In contrast, if 
the opportunity is strong enough, even people with relatively 
strong self-control may be tempted to violate the law; the in-
centives to commit crime may overwhelm self-control.
Integrating criminal propensity and criminal opportu-
nity can explain why some children enter into chronic of-
fending while others living in similar environments are able 
to resist criminal activity. It can also help us understand why 
the corporate executive with a spotless record gets caught up 
in business fraud. Even a successful executive may fi nd self-
control inadequate if the potential for illegal gain is large. 
Unlike other theoretical models that explain only nar-
row segments of criminal behavior (i.e., teenage gang for-
mation), Gottfredson and Hirschi argue that self-control 
applies equally to all crimes, ranging from murder to corpo-
rate theft. White-collar crime rates remain low, they claim, 
because people who lack self-control rarely attain the po-
sitions necessary to commit those crimes. However, the 
relatively few white-collar criminals lack self-control to the 
same degree and in the same manner as criminals such as 
rapists and burglars (see the Profi les in Crime feature “James 
Paul Lewis, Jr.: ‘Crime Against Humanity,’” for an account of 
someone who may fi t this description).
Empirical Support for GTC Since the publication of 
A General Theory of Crime, numerous researchers have

One criticism of the General Theory of Crime is that people actually do 
change over their lifetimes. Here, pictures of cofounder of the Crips gang 
Stanley “Tookie” Williams show him at an early age. Sentenced to prison 
for the 1979 murders of four people, Williams spent several years 
involved with violent activities in prison, but around 1993 changed his 
behavior and became an antigang activist. Williams coauthored such 
books as Life in Prison, which encourages kids to stay out of gangs, and 
his memoir Blue Rage, Black Redemption. Williams was nominated for 
the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Do you believe that a gang leader 
like Tookie Williams can really change, or did his changing life 
circumstances (i.e., being incarcerated) simply prevent him from 
committing violent criminal acts? Williams was executed in 2005.

efforts. Others, more impulsive, may bend the rules for 
their own benefi t. The Profi les in Crime feature illustrates 
the crimes of one such impulsive person.
Different classes of criminals.
 
■
 As you may recall, Moffi tt 
has identifi ed two classes of criminals—adolescent-
limited and life course persistent.112 Other researchers 
have found that there may be different criminal paths 
or trajectories. People offend at a different pace, commit 
different kinds of crimes, and are infl uenced by differ-
ent external forces.113 For example, most criminals tend 
to be “generalists” who engage in a garden variety of 
criminal acts. However, some people “specialize” in vio-
lent crimes and others in theft offenses, and these two 
groups seem quite different in personality and tempera-
ment.114 This would contradict the GTC vision that a 
single factor causes crime and that there is a single class 
of offender.
Ecological differences.
 
■
 The GTC also fails to address indi-
vidual and ecological patterns in the crime rate. If crime 
rates are higher in Los Angeles than in Albany, New 
York, can it be assumed that residents of Los Angeles 
are more impulsive than residents of Albany? There is 
little evidence of regional differences in impulsivity or 
self-control. Can these differences be explained solely 
by variation in criminal opportunity? Few researchers 
The driven executive, accustomed to both academic and 
fi nancial success, may fi nd that the fear of failure can neu-
tralize his or her self-control. During tough economic times, 
the impulsive manager who fears dismissal may be tempted 
to circumvent the law to improve the bottom line.109
Although the General Theory seems persuasive, several 
questions and criticisms remain unanswered. Among the 
most important are the following:
Tautological.
 
■
 Some critics argue that the theory is tauto-
logical or involves circular reasoning: How do we know 
when people are impulsive? When they commit crimes! 
Are all criminals impulsive? Of course, or else they 
would not have broken the law!110
Gottfredson and Hirschi counter by saying that impul-
sivity is not itself a propensity to commit crime but a con-
dition that inhibits people from appreciating the long-term 
consequences of their behavior. Consequently, if given the 
opportunity, they are more likely to indulge in criminal 
acts than their nonimpulsive counterparts.111 According to 
Gottfredson and Hirschi, impulsivity and criminality are 
neither identical nor equivalent. Some impulsive people 
may channel their reckless energies into noncriminal ac-
tivity, such as trading on the commodities markets or real 
estate speculation, and make a legitimate fortune for their 
distressed businesses. Instead of investing 
the investors’ money as promised, Lewis 
used the funds to purchase homes in Villa 
Park, Laguna Niguel, Palm Desert, San Di-
ego, and Greenwich, Connecticut. He also 
used investors’ money to purchase luxury 
automobiles for himself, his wife, and his 
girlfriend. Among other schemes, he used 
investor money to trade currency futures, 
managing to lose at least $22 million. To 
conceal the scheme at FAC, Lewis ran a 
Ponzi scheme: he took the money of new 
investors (and new purchases of those who 
had already bought into the funds) to pay 
the rates of return promised to investors. In 
other words, he used the principal to pay 
the interest—until the money ran out. At 
one point, nearly 3,300 investors had a to-
tal balance of $813,932,080 in the funds, 
but FAC and Lewis’s bank accounts held 
only slightly more than $2 million.
At Lewis’s sentencing hearing, United 
States District Judge Cormac J. Carney 
ordered him to pay $156 million in restitu-
tion. Because many of his victims were el-
derly, Judge Carney described the scheme 
as a “crime against humanity.” Several vic-
tims told the court about their losses, which 
included life savings and college funds. 
Many victims described being forced back 
to work after losing their retirement savings 
in the scheme.
How would Gottfredson and Hirschi 
explain Lewis’s ongoing criminal activi-
ties? Can someone so calculating lack self-
control?

On May 26, 2006, James Paul Lewis, Jr., 
the former director of Orange County, 
 California–based Financial Advisory Consul-
tants (FAC), was sentenced to 30 years in 
federal prison for running a massive Ponzi

lose more than $156 million of their hard-
earned money.
What exactly did James Lewis do to earn 
a 30-year prison sentence? He offered in-
vestors opportunities to invest in two mu-
tual funds. Through false and fraudulent 
brochures and other promotional material 
issued by FAC, he told investors that they 
would earn annual rates of return of up 
to 18 percent in an income fund, which 
claimed to generate revenue from the 
leasing of medical equipment, commer-
cial lending, and financing insurance pre-
miums, and 40 percent annual returns in 
a growth fund, which claimed to generate 
revenue through the purchase and sale of

life (making deviant friends) should not infl uence crimi-
nal propensity. Gottfredson and Hirschi might counter 
that it should come as no surprise that impulsive kids, 
lacking in self-control, seek out peers with similar per-
sonality characteristics.
People change.
 
■
 One of the most important questions 
raised about the GTC concerns its assumption that 
criminal propensity does not change. Is it possible that 
human personality and behavior patterns remain unal-
tered over the life course? Research shows that changing 
life circumstances, such as starting and leaving school, 
abusing substances and then getting straight, and start-
ing or ending personal relationships all infl uence the 
frequency of offending.125 Involvement in organized 
activities such as karate that teach self-discipline and 
self-regulation have been shown to improve personality 
traits in at-risk kids, even those diagnosed with opposi-
tional defi ance disorder.126 As people mature, they may 
be better able to control their impulsive behavior and 
reduce their criminal activities.127
Effective parenting.
 
■
 Gottfredson and Hirschi propose that 
children either develop self-control by the end of early 
childhood or fail to develop it at all. Research shows, 
however, that some kids who are predisposed toward 
delinquency may fi nd their life circumstances improved 
and their involvement with antisocial behavior dimin-
ished if they are exposed to positive and effective parent-
ing that appears later in life.128 Parenting can infl uence 
self-control in later adolescence and kids who receive 
improved parenting may improve their self-control much 
later in the life course than predicted by the GTC.129
 Some of the most signifi cant research on this topic 
has been conducted by Ronald Simons and his col-
leagues. Simons has found that boys who were involved 
in deviant and oppositional behavior during child-
hood were able to turn their lives around if they later 
experienced improved parenting, increased school 
commitment, and/or reduced involvement with deviant 
peers. So while early childhood antisocial behavior may 
increase the chances of later criminality, even the most 
diffi cult children are at no greater risk for delinquency 
than are their conventional counterparts if they later 
experience positive changes in their daily lives and in-
creased ties with signifi cant others and institutions.130
Modest relationship.
 
■
 Some research results support the 
proposition that self-control is a causal factor in crimi-
nal and other forms of deviant behavior, but that the 
association is at best quite modest.131 This would indi-
cate that other forces infl uence criminal behavior and 
that low self-control alone cannot predict the onset of a 
criminal or deviant career. Perhaps antisocial behavior 
is best explained by a condition that either develops 
subsequent to the development of self-control or is 
independent of a person’s level of impulsivity.132 This 
alternative quality, which may be the real stable latent 
trait, is still unknown.
have tried to account for the infl uence of culture, ecol-
ogy, economy, and so on. Gottfredson and Hirschi 
might counter that crime rate differences may refl ect 
criminal opportunity: one area may have more effec-
tive law enforcement, more draconian laws, and higher 
levels of guardianship. In their view, opportunity is con-
trolled by economy and culture.
Racial and gender differences.
 
■
 Although distinct gen-
der differences in the crime rate exist, there is little 
evidence that males are more impulsive than females 
(although females and males differ in many other per-
sonality traits).115 Some research efforts have found 
gender differences in the association between self-con-
trol and crime; the theory predicts no such difference 
should occur.116
 Looking at this relationship from another perspec-
tive, males who persist in crime exhibit characteristics 
that are different than female persisters. Women seem 
to be infl uenced by their place of residence, childhood 
and recent abuses, living with a criminal partner, sell-
ing drugs, stress, depression, fearfulness, their romantic 
relationships, their children, and whether they have 
suicidal thoughts. In contrast, men are more likely to 
persist because of their criminal peer associations, car-
rying weapons, alcohol abuse, and aggressive feelings. 
Impulsivity alone may not be able to explain why males 
and females persist or desist.117
 Similarly, Gottfredson and Hirschi explain racial dif-
ferences in the crime rate as a failure of childrearing 
practices in the African American community.118 In so 
doing, they overlook issues of institutional racism, pov-
erty, and relative deprivation, which have been shown 
to have a signifi cant impact on crime rate differentials.
Moral beliefs.
 
■
 The General Theory also ignores the moral 
concept of right and wrong, or “belief.”119 Recent re-
search by Olena Antonaccio and Charles Tittle found 
that holding moral values may trump low self-control—
that is, high moral standards can inhibit crime even 
among impulsive individuals.120
Peer infl uence
 
■
. A number of research efforts show that 
the quality of peer relations either enhances or controls 
criminal behavior and that these infl uences vary over 
time.121 As children mature, peer infl uence continues to 
grow.122 Research shows that kids who lack self-control 
also have trouble maintaining relationships with law-
abiding peers. They may either choose or be forced to 
seek out friends who are similarly limited in their ability 
to maintain self-control.123 Similarly, as they mature they 
may seek out romantic relationships with law-violating 
boyfriends or girlfriends, and these entanglements en-
hance the likelihood that they will get further involved 
in crime (girls seem more deeply infl uenced by their 
delinquent boyfriends than boys by their delinquent 
girlfriends).124 This fi nding contradicts the GTC, which 
suggests the infl uence of friends should be stable and 
unchanging and that a relationship established later in

CHAPTER 9 | Developmental Theories: Life Course, Latent Trait, and Trajectory  315
You think I wanta be selling drugs on the street my 
whole life? No way, but I know these n—[above me] 
are making more money. . . . So you know, I fi gure I 
got a chance to move up. But if not, s—, I get me a 
job doin’ something else.142
 This quotation does not comport with the notion of a 
super-impulsive young criminal. Even though few gang 
recruits will ever become gang leaders, they are willing 
to take the risk in order to earn a future benefi t. This 
fi nding contradicts Gottfredson and Hirschi’s vision 
of an impulsive criminal who lives for today without 
worrying about tomorrow.
Self-control may waiver.
 
■
 Gottfredson and Hirschi assume 
that impulsivity is a singular construct—one is either 
impulsive or not. However, there may be more than one 
kind of impulsive personality and it may waiver over 
time. Some people may be impulsive because they are 
sensation seekers who are constantly looking for novel 
experiences, while others lack deliberation and rarely 
think through problems. Some may give up easily while 
others act without thinking. Some people may have the 
ability to persist in self-control while others “get tired” 
and eventually succumb to their impulses.143 Think of 
it this way: a dieter ogles the cheesecake in the fridge all 
day but has the self-control not to take a slice. Then he 
wakes hungry in the middle of the night and makes his 
way into the kitchen, thinking “a little piece of cheese-
cake won’t hurt me.” His self-control slips, and his diet 
goes out the window.
From the above, it is easy to gauge interest in the GTC. 
And while there has been criticism, it remains one of the 
most important criminological theories of the past few de-
cades. Although questions remain, the strength of the GTC 
lies in its scope and breadth: it attempts to explain all forms 
of crime and deviance, from lower-class gang delinquency 
to sexual harassment in the business community.144 By in-
tegrating concepts of criminal choice, criminal opportunity, 
socialization, and personality, Gottfredson and Hirschi make 
a plausible argument that all deviant behaviors may origi-
nate at the same source. Continued efforts are needed to test 
the GTC and establish the validity of its core concepts. It 
remains one of the key developments of modern crimino-
logical theory.
TRAJECTORY THEORIES
Trajectory theory is a third developmental approach that 
combines elements of latent trait and life course theory. The 
basic premise is that there is more than one path to crime and 
more than one class of offender; there are different trajectories 
Cross-cultural differences. 
 
■
There is some evidence that 
criminals in other countries do not lack self-control, 
indicating that the GTC may be culturally limited. Ot-
win Marenin and Michael Resig actually found equal or 
higher levels of self-control in Nigerian criminals than 
in noncriminals.133 Behavior that may be considered 
imprudent in one culture may be socially acceptable 
in another and therefore cannot be viewed as lack of 
self-control.134 There is, however, emerging evidence 
that the GTC may have validity in predicting criminality 
abroad.135
Misreads human nature.
 
■
 According to Francis Cullen, 
John Paul Wright, and Mitchell Chamlin, the GTC 
makes fl awed assumptions about human character.136 It 
assumes that people are essentially selfi sh, self-serving, 
and hedonistic and must therefore be controlled lest 
they gratify themselves at the expense of others. A more 
plausible view is that humans are inherently generous 
and kind; selfi sh hedonists may be a rare exception.
One of many causes.
 
■
 Research shows that even if lack 
of self-control is a prerequisite to crime, so are other 
social, neuropsychological, and physiological factors.137 
Social cultural factors have been found to make an 
independent contribution to criminal offending pat-
terns.138 Among the many psychological characteristics 
that set criminals apart from the general population is 
their lack of self-direction; their behavior has a here-
and-now orientation rather than being aimed at provid-
ing long-term benefi ts.139 Law violators also exhibit 
lower resting heart rates and perform poorly on tasks 
that trigger cognitive functions.140
Some criminals are not impulsive.
 
■
 Gottfredson and Hir-
shi assume that criminals are impatient or “present-
oriented.” They choose to commit crime because the 
rewards can be enjoyed immediately while the costs 
or punishments come later or may not come at all. As 
long as the gains from crime are immediate while the 
costs of crime are delayed, impulsive present-oriented 
individuals will commit crimes even if they are not 
obviously lucrative. However, not all research efforts 
support this position. As you may recall (Chapter 4), 
Steven Levitt and Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh found that 
many young gang boys are willing to wait years to “rise 
through the ranks” before earning high wages. Their 
stay in the gang is fueled by the promises of future 
compensation, a fact that contradicts the GTC. Levitt 
and Venkatesh conclude that the economic aspects of 
the decision to join the gang can be viewed as a tour-
nament in which participants vie for large awards that 
only a small fraction will eventually obtain. Members 
of the gang accept low wages in the present in the hope 
that they will advance in the gang and earn well above 
market wages in the future.141
 Moreover, gang members seem acutely aware that 
they are making an investment in the future by forego-
ing present gains. As one noted:

chronic offenders. Some are high-rate offenders, whereas 
others offend at relatively low frequencies but are persistent 
in their criminal activities, never really stopping.150
In sum, there are different paths to crime. Both life 
course and latent trait theories maintain that most persis-
tent offenders are early starters, beginning their delinquent 
careers in their adolescence and persisting into adulthood. 
In contrast, trajectory theories hold that people begin their 
offending careers at different points of their lives and fol-
low different offending trajectories. Those who engage in 
repeated and sustained involvement with the law in early 
adolescence are the ones most likely to continue to violate 
the law late into their adulthood.151
However, not all chronic offenders begin early in life. 
Some are “late bloomers” who stay out of trouble until 
relatively late in adolescence.152 Researchers Sarah Bacon, 
Raymond Paternoster, and Robert Brame found that late 
bloomers are actually the teens most likely to get involved 
in serious adult offending.153 Because late bloomers com-
bine psychopathology with risk-taking behavior and poor 
social skills, their behavior becomes increasingly violent 
over time.154 So while these late starters may start slow, they 
eventually catch up later in their adolescence.
 There is also a group of abstainers or non-offenders. 
Despite the fact that most of their peers engage in a wide 
variety of antisocial activities, these people never break the 
law; their conventional behavior makes them deviant be-
cause offending is the norm!
Why do some people refrain from antisocial activity of 
any sort? Who are these folks who never ever shoplifted, 
smoked pot, got drunk, or 
had a fi ght? According to so-
cial psychologist Terrie Mof-
fitt, abstainers are social 
introverts as teens, whose un-
popularity shielded them from 
group pressure to commit de-
linquent acts.155 Other experts 
disagree, suggesting that con-
formity may be related more 
to close parental monitoring 
and involvement with proso-
cial peer groups than it is to 
being unpopular.156
Pathways to Crime
Trajectory theory recognizes 
that criminals may travel 
more than a single road. Some 
may specialize in violence 
and extortion; some may be 
involved in theft and fraud; 
others may engage in a variety 
of criminal acts.
in a criminal career. All people are different, and one model 
cannot hope to describe every person’s journey through life. 
Some are social and have a large peer group, while others are 
loners who make decisions on their own.145 Because latent 
trait theories disregard social infl uences during the life span, 
and life course theories maintain that social events seem to 
affect all people equally, they both miss out on the fact that 
there are different classes and types of offenders.
The reality is that there may be different paths or trajecto-
ries to a criminal career. People offend at a different pace, com-
mit different kinds of crimes, and are infl uenced by different 
external forces.146 For example, people who commit violent 
crimes may be different from nonviolent offenders and main-
tain a unique set of personality traits and problem behaviors.147 
This would contradict the GTC vision that a single factor causes 
delinquency and that there is a single class of offender.
Early, Late, and Non-Starters
According to this view, not all persistent offenders begin at 
an early age. Some are precocious, beginning their criminal 
careers early and persisting into adulthood.148 Others stay 
out of trouble in adolescence and do not violate the law un-
til their teenage years. Some offenders may peak at an early 
age, whereas others persist into adulthood. Some people 
maximize their offending rates at a relatively early age and 
then reduce their antisocial activity; others persist into their 
20s. Some are high-rate offenders, whereas others offend 
at relatively low rates.149 There are even different classes of 
There is a strong association between parental and children’s deviance. In this photo from surveillance 
videotape in a Bedford, New Hampshire, store, a woman with her daughter (behind the counter) and her 
son (at left) are shown in the process of stealing more than $2,000 worth of jewelry. The woman turned 
herself in after Bedford police made the video public.

This behavior eventually escalates to more serious forms

larceny, and fencing to passing bad checks, using stolen

Some of the most important research on delinquent 
paths or trajectories has been conducted by Rolf Loeber and

burgh youth, Loeber has identifi ed three distinct paths to a

318  PART TWO | THEORIES OF CRIME CAUSATION
Later as adults, some specialize in a particular criminal ac-
tivity such as drug traffi cking, while others are involved in 
an assortment of deviant acts—selling drugs, committing 
robberies, and getting involved in break-ins—when the 
situation arises and the opportunities are present.158 There 
may be a multitude of criminal career subgroupings (for ex-
ample, prostitutes, drug dealers), each with its own distinc-
tive career path. The Profi les in Crime feature describes the 
path to murder taken by a band of notorious killers.
two and even three paths simultaneously: they are stub-
born, lie to teachers and parents, are bullies, and commit 
petty thefts. Those taking more than one path are the most 
likely to become persistent offenders as they mature.
Although some persistent offenders may specialize in 
one type of behavior, others engage in varied criminal acts 
and antisocial behaviors as they mature. As adolescents, 
they cheat on tests, bully kids in the school yard, take drugs, 
commit burglary, steal a car, and then shoplift from a store. 
Hunter, and Salas armed themselves with 
aluminum bats, put on all-black clothing, 
covered their faces with scarves, kicked in 
the front door, and attacked Belanger and 
her roommates as they slept. All six victims, 
including Erin Belanger, were beaten and 
stabbed beyond recognition. All six died.
The perpetrators of the deadly attack left 
a trail of clues that resulted in their quick 
arrest and indictment on murder charges. 
It was a pretty sad bunch; they all seemed 
to have lived troubled lives. Michael Salas 
was abused even before his birth by his 
mother, who used drugs during her preg-
nancy, traded food stamps for cocaine, and 
left her three sons alone for long periods 
during the winter. Child protective services 
found cigarette burns on the boys’ bodies. 
Salas’s father died of AIDS when Salas was 
9. Hunter is a clinically depressed, mentally 
ill man whose parents were both committed 
to mental hospitals at the time of the mas-
sacre. As early as age 3, Hunter conversed 
with his identical twin brother Jeremy, who 
died from pneumonia at 6 months old. But it 
was Victorino, a 6-foot-6, 300-pound career 
criminal, who most outraged the public. 
He had spent 8 of the last 11 years before 
the killings serving prison sentences for a 
variety of crimes, including auto theft, bat-
tery, arson, burglary, and theft. In 1996, he 
beat a man so severely that doctors needed 
15 titanium plates to rebuild the victim’s 
face. Not surprisingly, Victorino also had a 
long history of physical and sexual abuse 
that began at the time he was 2 years old. 
He suffered from neurological impairment 
that resulted in poor impulse control and 
the inability to manage his violent temper.
Despite their personal problems, on Au-
gust 2, 2006, Victorino and Hunter were 
sentenced to death by lethal injection, and 
Cannon and Salas to life in prison with-
out the possibility of parole. Victorino and 
Hunter remain on death row at the Florida 
State Prison in Starke because the average 
length of incarceration of a Florida inmate 
prior to execution is more than 10 years.
The Xbox killers followed a classic de-
velopmental path: early abuse and prob-
lems in childhood leading to a long and 
sustained criminal career. These killers did 
not age out of crime but persisted and es-
calated their criminal involvement until it 
culminated in unspeakable tragedy.

The Xbox Killers
In the hot summer months of 2004, Troy 
Victorino and friends Robert Cannon, Je-
rome Hunter, and Michael Salas were ille-
gally squatting in a Deltona, Florida, home 
and using it as a “party house.” The own-
ers, who were spending the summer in 
Maine, asked their granddaughter, Erin Be-
langer, to check up on the property. When 
she saw what was going on she called the 
police in order to get the squatters removed 
from the premises. Victorino (who was in 
jail on an unrelated matter at the time his 
friends were evicted) left behind an Xbox 
game system and some clothes, and Be-
langer took possession of these items. 
Once he was released from jail on bond, 
Victorino, feeling disrespected because the 
police had been called and his stuff con-
fiscated, threatened Belanger and slashed 
the tires on her car. He warned her that un-
less she returned the items, he was going 
to come back and beat her with a baseball 
bat while she was sleeping. It was not an 
idle threat. On August 6, 2004, in what is 
now known either as the Xbox murders or 
the Deltona massacre, Victorino, Cannon,

environment seem to have the greatest influence on life 
course persistence.163
It is not surprising, then, that many life course persist-
ers display elements of problem behavior syndrome, includ-
ing mental health problems, psychiatric pathologies, limited 
school achievement, ADHD, and health issues.164
Research shows that the persistence patterns predicted 
by Moffi tt are valid and accurate.165 Life course persisters 
offend more frequently and engage in a greater variety of an-
tisocial acts than other offenders; they also manifest signifi -
cantly more mental health problems, including psychiatric 
pathologies, than adolescent-limited offenders.166
The Thinking Like a Criminologist feature concerns the 
behavior of a life course persister.
EVALUATING 
DEVELOPMENTAL THEORIES
Although the differences between the views presented in 
this chapter may seem irreconcilable, they in fact share 
some common ground. They indicate that a criminal career 
must be understood as a passage along which people travel, 
Adolescent-Limited Offenders vs. Life 
Course Persisters
According to psychologist Terrie Moffi tt, most young offend-
ers follow one of two paths. Adolescent-limited offenders
may be considered “typical teenagers” who get into minor 
scrapes and engage in what might be considered rebellious 
teenage behavior with their friends.159 As they reach their 
mid-teens, adolescent-limited delinquents begin to mimic 
the antisocial behavior of more troubled teens, only to re-
duce the frequency of their offending as they mature to 
around age 18.160 So while it may be cool for some kids to 
swagger around and get into trouble during their teenage 
years, they are ready to settle down and assume more con-
ventional roles as they enter young adulthood.
The second path is the one taken by a small group of 
life course persisters who begin their offending career at 
a very early age and continue to offend well into adult-
hood.161 Moffi t fi nds that the seeds of life course persis-
tence are planted early in life and may combine the effects 
of abnormal traits, such as neurological defi cits, with se-
vere family dysfunction. Life course persisters are more 
likely to manifest abnormal personal traits such as low 
verbal ability, impaired reasoning skills, limited learning 
ability, and weak spatial and memory functions than ad-
olescent-limited offenders.162 Individual traits rather than 
Gary L. Sampson, 41, addicted to alcohol and co-
caine, was a deadbeat dad, a two-bit thief, and a 
bank robber with a long history of violence. On 
August 1, 2001, he turned himself in to the Ver-
mont State Police after fleeing from a string of 
three murders he committed in Massachusetts 
and New Hampshire.
Those who knew Sampson speculated 
that his murders were a desperate finale to a 
troubled life. During his early life in New Eng-
land, he once bound, gagged, and beat three 
elderly women in a candy store, hijacked 
cars at knifepoint, and had been medically 
diagnosed as schizophrenic. In 1977, he 
married a 17-year-old girl he had impregnated; two months later 
he was arrested and charged with rape for having “unnatural in-
tercourse with a child under 16.” Although he was acquitted of 
that charge, his wife noticed that Sampson was developing a hair-
trigger temper and had become increasingly violent; their mar-
riage soon ended. As the years passed, Sampson had at least 
four failed marriages, was an absentee father to two children, and 
became an alcoholic and a drug user; he spent nearly half of his 
adult life behind bars.
Jumping bail after being arrested for theft from an an-
tique store, he headed south to North Carolina and took 
on a new identity: Gary Johnson, a construction worker. 
He took up with Ricki Carter, a transvestite, but their re-
lationship was anything but stable. Sampson once put a 
gun to Carter’s head, broke his ribs, and threatened to kill 
his family. After his breakup with Carter, Sampson moved 
in with a new girlfriend, Karen Anderson, and began pulling 
bank jobs. When the police closed in, Sampson fled north. 
Needing transportation, he carjacked three vehicles and 
killed the drivers, one a 19-year-old college freshman who 
had stopped to give Sampson a hand. In December 2003, 
Sampson received a death sentence from a jury that was not 
swayed by his claim that he was mentally unfit.

clemency in the case and reduce Sampson’s sentence to life in 
prison because of the abuse he suffered as a child. She asks you 
to help her make the judgment. To help her, select two groups, 
one representing Sampson’s interests, the other the prosecution’s, 
and present the governor with a memorandum that will help her 
decide Sampson’s future. Make sure you address the following is-

that it has a beginning and an end, and that events and life 
circumstances infl uence the journey. The factors that affect 
a criminal career may include structural factors, such as in-
come and status; socialization factors, such as family and 
peer relations; biological factors, such as size and strength; 
psychological factors, including intelligence and personality; 
and opportunity factors, such as free time, inadequate police 
protection, and a supply of easily stolen merchandise.
Life course theories emphasize the infl uence of changing 
interpersonal and structural factors (that is, people change 
along with the world they live in). Latent trait theories place 
more emphasis on the fact that behavior is linked less to 
personal change and more to changes in the surround-
ing world. Trajectory theories fi nd that there are different 
classes of offenders who may change at different points of 
their criminal career.
These perspectives differ in their view of human devel-
opment. Do people constantly change, as life course theo-
ries suggest, or are they stable, constant, and changeless, as 
the latent trait view indicates? Are the factors that produce 
criminality different at each stage of life, as the life course 
view suggests, or does a master trait—such as control bal-
ance, self-control, or coercion—steer the course of human 
behavior? Is there a single path to crime or are there differ-
ent paths and different trajectories?
It is also possible that these positions are not mutu-
ally exclusive, and each may make a notable contribution 
to understanding the onset and continuity of a criminal 
career. In other words, stable individual characteristics—
latent traits—may interact with or modify the effects of 
life course–varying social factors to increase their effect 
and shape the direction of criminal careers.167 Is it possi-
ble that people take different paths to crime because they 
have different levels of criminal propensity? Needless to 
say, measuring these effects is quite complex and relies on 
sophisticated research techniques. One research effort by 
Bradley Entner Wright and his associates found evidence 
supporting both latent trait and life course theories.168 
Their research, conducted with subjects in New Zealand, 
indicates that low self-control in childhood predicts dis-
rupted social bonds and criminal offending later in life, a 
fi nding that supports latent trait theory. They also found 
that maintaining positive social bonds helps reduce crimi-
nality and that maintaining prosocial bonds could even 
counteract the effect of low self-control. Latent traits are an 
important infl uence on crime, but their fi ndings indicate 
that social relationships that form later in life appear to in-
fl uence criminal behavior “above and beyond” individuals’ 
preexisting characteristics.169 This fi nding may refl ect the 
fact that there are different classes of criminals: a less seri-
ous group who are infl uenced by life events, and a more 
chronic group whose latent traits insulate them from any 
positive prosocial relationships; this fi nding supports tra-
jectory theory concepts.170
Concept Summary 9.1 sets out the most important life 
course, latent trait, and trajectory theories.
PUBLIC POLICY 
IMPLICATIONS OF 
DEVELOPMENTAL 
THEORY
There have been a number of policy initiatives based on 
premises of developmental theory. These typically feature 
multisystemic treatment efforts designed to provide at-risk 
kids with personal, social, educational, and family services. 
For example, one program found that an intervention that 
promotes academic success, social competence, and educa-
tional enhancement during the elementary grades can re-
duce risky sexual practices and their accompanying health 
consequences in early adulthood.171
Other programs are now employing multidimensional 
strategies and are aimed at targeting children in preschool 
through the early elementary grades in order to alter the 
direction of their life course. Many of the most successful 
programs focus on strengthening children’s social-emo-
tional competence and positive coping skills and suppress-
ing the development of antisocial, aggressive behavior.172 
Research evaluations indicate that the most promising mul-
ticomponent crime and substance abuse prevention pro-
grams for youths, especially those at high risk, are aimed 
at improving their developmental skills. They may include 
a school component, an after-school component, and a 
parent-involvement component. All of these components 
have the common goal of increasing protective factors and 
decreasing risk factors in the areas of the family, the com-
munity, the school, and the individual.173 The Boys and 
Girls Clubs and School Collaborations’ Substance Abuse 
Prevention Program includes a school component called 
SMART (Skills Mastery and Resistance Training) Teach-
ers, an after-school component called SMART Kids, and 
a parent-involvement component called SMART Parents. 
Each component is designed to reduce specifi c risk factors 
in the children’s school, family, community, and personal 
environments.174
Another successful program, Fast Track, is designed to 
prevent serious antisocial behavior and related adolescent 
problems in high-risk children entering first grade. The 
intervention is guided by a developmental approach that 
suggests that antisocial behavior is the product of the inter-
action of multiple social and psychological infl uences:
Residence in low-income, high-crime communities 
 
■
places stressors and infl uences on children and families 
that increase their risk levels. In these areas, families 
characterized by marital confl ict and instability make 
consistent and effective parenting diffi cult to achieve, 
particularly with children who are impulsive and of 
 diffi cult temperament.

support from teachers. All of these processes increase 
the risk of antisocial behaviors, in a process that begins 
in elementary school and lasts throughout adolescence. 
During this period, peer infl uences, academic diffi cul-
ties, and dysfunctional personal identity development 
can contribute to serious conduct problems and related 
risky behaviors.149

LIFE COURSE 
THEORIES
As people go through the life course, 
social and personal traits undergo 
change and influence behavior.
Explains why some at-risk children 
desist from crime.
Identify critical moments in 
a person’s life course that 
produce crime.
Interactional Theory
Criminals go through lifestyle changes 
during their offending career. Crime 
influences lifestyle and changing 
lifestyle influences crime.
Combines sociological and 
psychological theories.
Identify crime-producing 
interpersonal interactions 
and their reciprocal effects.
General Theory of Crime 
and Delinquency (GTCD)
Five critical life domains shape 
criminal behavior and are shaped by 
criminal behavior.
Shows that crime and other aspects 
of social life are interactive and 
developmental.
Measure the relationship 
between life domains and 
crime.
Age-Graded Theory
As people mature, the factors that 
influence their propensity to commit 
crime change. In childhood, family 
factors are critical; in adulthood, 
marital and job factors are key.
Shows how crime is a 
developmental process that shifts 
in direction over the life course.
Identify critical points 
in the life course that 
produce crime. Analyze the 
association between social 
capital and crime.
LATENT TRAIT 
THEORIES
A master trait controls human 
development.
Explains the continuity of crime 
and chronic offending.
Identify master trait that 
produces crime.
Integrated Cognitive 
Antisocial Potential 
(ICAP) Theory
People with antisocial potential (AP) 
are at risk to commit antisocial acts. 
AP can be viewed as both a long- and 
short-term phenomenon.
Identifies different types of 
criminal propensities and shows 
how they may influence behavior in 
both the short and long term.
Identify the components of 
long- and short-term AP.
General Theory of Crime
Crime and criminality are separate 
concepts. People choose to commit 
crime when they lack self-control. 
People lacking self-control will seize 
criminal opportunities.
Integrates choice and social control 
concepts. Identifies the difference 
between crime and criminality.
Measure associations among 
impulsivity, low self-control, 
and criminal behaviors.
Differential Coercion 
Theory
Individuals exposed to coercive 
environments develop social-
psychological deficits that enhance 
their probability of engaging in 
criminal behavior.
Explains why a feeling of coercion 
is a master trait that determines 
behavior.
Measuring the sources of 
coercion.
Control Balance Theory
A person’s “control ratio” influences 
his or her behavior.
Explains how the ability to control 
one’s environment is a master trait.
Measuring control balance 
and imbalance.
TRAJECTORY THEORY
There is more than one pathway to 
crime.
Explains the existence of different 
types and classes of criminals.
Measuring different criminal 
paths.
Life Course Persistent/
Adolescent Limited
People begin their criminal activities 
at different points in their lives.
Explains why most adolescent 
misbehavior is limited to youthful 
misadventures.
Measuring the starting and 
stopping points of criminal 
activity.

Group differences continued through adolescence. Court 
records indicate that by eighth grade, 38 percent of the in-
tervention group boys had been arrested, in contrast with 
42 percent of the control group. Finally, psychiatric inter-
views after ninth grade indicate that the Fast Track interven-
tion has reduced serious conduct disorder by over a third, 
from 27 percent to 17 percent. These effects generalized 
across gender and ethnic groups and across the wide range 
of child and family characteristics measured by Fast Track.
playground. By the end of the third grade, 37 percent of the 
intervention group had become free of conduct problems, in 
contrast with 27 percent of the control group. By the end of 
elementary school, 33 percent of the intervention group had 
a developmental trajectory of decreasing conduct problems, 
as compared with 27 percent of the control group. Further-
more, placement in special education by the end of elemen-
tary school was about one-fourth lower in the intervention 
group than in the control group.
 1. Discuss the history of develop-
mental theory
The foundation of this theory is 
 
■
Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck’s 
integration of biological, psy-
chological, and social factors. 
Later the Glueck data was 
rediscovered by criminolo-
gists Robert Sampson and John 
Laub. The Philadelphia cohort 
research by Marvin Wolfgang 
and his associates investigated 
criminal career development. 
Rolf Loeber and Marc LeBlanc 
proposed that criminologists 
should devote time and effort to 
understanding basic questions 
about the evolution of criminal 
careers.
 2. Distinguish between the life 
course, latent trait, and trajec-
tory theories
Life course theorists view 
 
■
criminality as a dynamic pro-
cess infl uenced by a multitude 
of individual characteristics, 
traits, and social experiences. 
Life course theories look at 
such issues as the onset of 
crime, the escalation of of-
fenses, the persistence of crime, 
and desistance from crime. 
Latent trait theorists believe 
that human development is 
controlled by a “master trait” 
that guides human develop-
ment and gives some people an 
increased propensity to commit 
crime. Trajectory theory holds 
that there are multiple path-
ways to crime.
 3. Be familiar with the principles 
of the life course theory
At an early age, people begin 
 
■
relationships and behaviors 
that will determine their adult 
life course. Some individuals 
are incapable of maturing in a 
reasonable and timely fashion. 
A positive life experience may 
help some criminals desist 
from crime for a while, but a 
negative experience may cause 
them to resume their criminal 
activities. As people mature, 
the factors that infl uence their 
behavior change. The social, 
physical, and environmental 
infl uences on their behavior 
are transformed.
 4. Explain the term problem 
 behavior syndrome
Crime is one of a group of inter-
 
■
related antisocial behaviors that 
cluster together. Problem be-
haviors typically involve family 
dysfunction, sexual and physical 
abuse, substance abuse, smok-
ing, precocious sexuality and 
early pregnancy, educational 
underachievement, suicide at-
tempts, sensation seeking, and 
unemployment. People who suf-
fer from one of these conditions 
SUMMARY
typically exhibit many symp-
toms of the rest.
 5. Discuss why age of onset is an 
important factor in crime
Early onset of antisocial behavior 
 
■
predicts later and more serious 
criminality. Adolescent offenders 
whose criminal behavior persists 
into adulthood are likely to have 
begun their deviant careers at a 
very early (preschool) age. Early-
onset kids tend to have poor 
parental discipline and monitor-
ing, inadequate emotional sup-
port, distant peer relationships, 
and psychological issues and 
problems.
 6. Know the basic principles of 
Sampson and Laub’s age-graded 
theory
Sampson and Laub fi nd that 
 
■
the maintenance of a criminal 
career can be affected by events 
that occur later in life. They rec-
ognize the role of social capital 
and its infl uence on the trajec-
tory of a criminal career. When 
faced with personal crisis, of-
fenders lack the social supports 
that can help them reject crimi-
nal solutions. Sampson and 
Laub view criminal careers as a 
dynamic process in which im-
portant life events can change 
the direction of a person’s life-
course trajectory; these key 
events are called turning points.

CHAPTER 9 | Developmental Theories: Life Course, Latent Trait, and Trajectory  323
According to Wilson and 
 
■
Herrnstein, all human behav-
ior, including criminality, is 
determined by its perceived 
consequences. A criminal 
incident occurs when an indi-
vidual chooses criminal over 
conventional behavior. Wilson 
and Herrnstein assume that 
both biological and psychologi-
cal traits infl uence the choice 
between crime and noncrime. 
Wilson and Herrnstein suggest 
the existence of an elusive latent 
trait that predisposes people to 
committing crime.
 9. Understand the basic principles 
of the General Theory of Crime
Gottfredson and Hirschi link 
 
■
the propensity to commit crime 
to an impulsive personality and 
a lack of self-control. People 
with limited self-control tend to 
be impulsive; they are insensi-
tive to other people’s feelings, 
predisposed toward physical 
(rather than mental) activities 
and solutions, risk takers, 
shortsighted, and nonverbal. 
Because those with low self-
control enjoy risky, exciting, 
or thrilling behaviors with im-
mediate gratifi cation, they are 
more likely to enjoy criminal 
acts. Gottfredson and Hirschi 
trace the root cause of poor 
self-control to inadequate child-
rearing practices.
 10. Discuss the concept of criminal 
trajectories
There are different pathways 
 
■
to crime and different types of 
criminals. Some career crimi-
nals may specialize in violence 
and extortion; some may be 
involved in theft and fraud; 
some may engage in a variety of 
criminal acts. Some offenders 
begin their careers early in life, 
whereas others are late bloom-
ers who begin committing 
crime at about the time when 
most people desist.
 7. Defi ne the term latent trait
A number of people in the 
 
■
population have a personal 
attribute or characteristic that 
controls their inclination or 
propensity to commit crimes. 
A latent trait is a stable feature, 
characteristic, property, or 
condition, present at birth or 
soon after, that makes some 
people crime prone over the 
life course. A latent trait may 
be either present at birth or 
established early in life, and it 
can remain stable over time. 
Suspected latent traits include 
defective intelligence, dam-
aged or impulsive personal-
ity, genetic abnormalities, the 
physical-chemical functioning 
of the brain, and environmen-
tal infl uences on brain func-
tion, such as drugs, chemicals, 
and injuries.

Crime Typologies
Criminologists group criminal offenders and criminal behaviors into categories 
or typologies so they may be more easily studied and understood. Are there 
common traits or characteristics that link offenders together and make them 
distinct from nonoffenders? Are there common areas between seemingly differ-
ent acts such as murder and rape?
In this section, we focus on crime typologies. They are clustered into six 
groups: violent crime (Chapter 10), political crime and terrorism (Chapter 11), 
property crimes involving common theft offenses and arson (Chapter 12), en-
terprise crimes involving white-collar and green-collar criminals (Chapter 13), 
public order crimes, such as prostitution and drug abuse (Chapter 14), and  cyber 
crimes and transnational organized crime (Chapter 15). This format groups crim-
inal behaviors by their focus: bringing physical harm to others,  misappropriating 
other people’s property, violating laws designed to protect public morals, and us-
ing technology to commit crime.
Typologies can be useful in classifying large numbers of criminal offenses or 
offenders into easily understood categories. This text has grouped offenses and 
offenders on the basis of their legal defi nitions and their collective goals, objec-
tives, and consequences.

The Huntsville Times/Landov 
BACK
(continued on page 332)
Back in 2006, Dr. Amy Bishop, a Harvard-trained neurobiologist, along with her husband Jim Anderson, 
invented a portable cell growth incubator designed to replace the old practice of growing cells in a Petri dish. 
Their highly sophisticated endeavor held much promise, and they were able to raise more than $1 million in 
start-up money to organize a biotech business. Four years later, this highly educated woman was in the news 
for an entirely different reason: while attending a faculty meeting at the University of Alabama’s Huntsville 
campus, Bishop shot to death three of her colleagues and severely wounded three others. The alleged reason: 
despite her achievements, Bishop was denied tenure (a lifetime academic appointment).
The case soon took on other bizarre twists. According to Massachusetts law enforcement authorities, 
in 1986, when she was 19, Bishop killed her own brother, Seth Bishop, with a shotgun blast. While there

332  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
THE CAUSES OF VIOLENCE
What sets off a violent person? Criminologists have a va-
riety of views on this subject. Some believe that violence 
is a function of human traits and makeup. Others point to 
improper socialization and upbringing. Violent behavior 
may be culturally determined and relate to dysfunctional 
social values.4 The various sources of violence are set out 
in Figure 10.1.
Psychological/Biological 
Abnormality
On March 13, 1995, an ex–Scout leader named Thomas 
Hamilton took four high-powered rifl es into the primary 
school of the peaceful Scottish town of Dunblane and 
slaughtered 16 kindergarten children and their teacher 
before taking his own life. This horrific crime shocked 
the British Isles into implementing strict controls on all 
guns.5 Bizarre outbursts such as Hamilton’s support a link 
between violence and some sort of mental or biological 
abnormality.
were suspicions of foul play at the time, the incident was ruled an accident and Bishop was not charged. 
In the aftermath of the Huntsville killings, the case was reopened. It seems that Amy Bishop took her 
father’s shotgun, loaded it, and fi red a shot in her bedroom, then went downstairs to the kitchen and 
shot her brother in the chest. She said she accidentally shot him while trying to fi gure how to unload 
the shotgun. However, it turns out that the police never told the district attorney’s offi ce that after she 
supposedly shot her brother by accident, Amy tried to commandeer a getaway car at gunpoint, and that 
she refused to drop her gun until offi cers repeatedly ordered her to do so. Another giveaway: a photo 
found in her bedroom, where she had loaded the 12-gauge shotgun, showed a National Enquirer article 
describing how a teenager wielding a 12-gauge shotgun killed the parents of actor Patrick Duffy, who 
played Bobby Ewing on the television show Dallas, and then commandeered a getaway car at gunpoint 
from an auto dealership. Bishop was indicted on her brother’s murder on June 16, 2010, and tried to 
commit suicide two days later.1 Then it was discovered that she was also a suspect in another violent 
incident: a package containing two bombs was sent to the home of Dr. Paul Rosenberg, a professor and 
doctor at Boston’s Children’s Hospital, soon after he had criticized her doctoral research.2 Ironically, at 
the time Amy Bishop is headed off to prison, the innovative medical device she created will be heading 
to market.
T
The Bishop case illustrates the toll violent crime takes on 
American society. It can divide a community, damage repu-
tations, and cause lifelong harm. It tells people that no mat-
ter where they go, they may encounter violent acts, even at 
a faculty meeting or in their own kitchen. Nor is violence 
committed solely by gang boys and drug dealers. You can 
also be attacked by your own sister or work colleague! Mil-
lions of violent crimes occur each year. Some are expressive 
violence—acts that vent rage, anger, or frustration—and 
some are instrumental violence—acts designed to improve 
the fi nancial or social position of the criminal, for example, 
through an armed robbery or murder for hire. No matter its 
cause, interpersonal violence takes a terrible toll. It causes 
people to live in fear, staying home at night and avoiding 
dangerous neighborhoods. It can also bring disorder to 
whole communities, disrupting services and driving down 
real estate values, further destabilizing areas already reeling 
from the shock of violent crimes.3
This chapter explores the concept of violence in some 
depth. First, it reviews the suggested causes of violent crime. 
Then it focuses on specifi c types of interpersonal violence—
rape, homicide, assault, robbery, and newly recognized 
types of interpersonal violence such as stalking and work-
place violence. Finally, it briefl y examines political violence 
and terrorism.

torturing and killing animals.12 Animal cruelty has been as-
sociated with a number of psychiatric disorders, including 
antisocial personality disorder.13
Human Instinct
Sigmund Freud believed that human behavior is shaped by 
two instinctual drives: eros, the life instinct, which drives 
people toward self-fulfi llment and enjoyment, and thanatos, 
the death instinct, which produces self-destruction. Thana-
tos can be expressed externally (e.g., violence and sadism) or 
internally (e.g., suicide, alcoholism, or other self-destructive 
habits).14
In his celebrated book On Aggression, anthropologist 
Konrad Lorenz argued that aggressive energy is produced 
by inbred instincts that are independent of environmental 
forces.15 In the animal kingdom, aggression usually serves 
a productive purpose—for example, it leads members of 
grazing species such as zebras and antelopes to spread out 
over available territory to ensure an ample food supply and 
the survival of the fi ttest. Lorenz found that humans possess 
some of the same aggressive instincts as animals. But among 
lower species, aggression is rarely fatal; when a confl ict oc-
curs, the winner is determined through a test of skill or en-
durance. This inhibition against killing members of their 
own species protects animals from self-extinction. Humans, 
lacking this inhibition against fatal violence, are capable of 
killing their own kind in war or as a result of interpersonal 
confl icts such as those arising over fi nding suitable mates.16
Lorenz feared that as technology develops and more 
lethal weapons are produced, the extinction of the human 
species becomes a signifi cant possibility.

Social Interaction In his recent book Violence: A Micro-
sociological Theory, sociologist Randall Collins proposes 
a theory of violence that seems diametrically opposed to 
Lorenz: humans are inherently passive and violence is a 
function of social interaction. Collins argues that most hu-
mans shirk from violent encounters and even those who 
talk aggressively are fearful and tense during violent en-
counters. Humans typically resort to violence only when 
they have overwhelming superiority over their opponents 
in terms of arms and numbers. While the thought of vio-
lence makes most people weak and scared, a supportive 
audience helps it become more palatable. Whether it’s gang 
boys acting in a group or terrorists being supported by 
their leaders, violence is more of a group process than an 
individual choice.
People who are involved in violent episodes may be suf-
fering from severe mental abnormalities.6 In a classic work, 
psychologist Dorothy Otnow Lewis showed that kids who 
kill may be suffering from multiple symptoms of psycho-
logical abnormality: neurological impairment (e.g., abnor-
mal EEGs, multiple psychomotor impairments, and severe 
seizures), low intelligence, and psychotic symptoms such 
as paranoia, illogical thinking, and hallucinations.7 In her 
book Guilty by Reason of Insanity, Lewis found that death 
row inmates have a history of mental impairment and intel-
lectual dysfunction.8
Lewis’s research is not unique. Abnormal personality 
structures, including such traits as depression, impulsivity, 
aggression, dishonesty, pathological lying, lack of remorse, 
borderline personality syndrome, and psychopathology, 
have all been associated with various forms of violence.9 It 
comes as no surprise to psychologists that many murderers 
kill themselves shortly after committing their crime.10
There is also evidence that personality disturbance is 
linked to some physical trait or characteristic. Neurosci-
entists claim to have found differences in both the limbic 
system and the prefrontal cortex of the brain that separates 
aggressive, violent people from the more level-headed and 
reasonable. According to this view, if some defect or injury 
impairs communication between the limbic system and the 
frontal cortex, a person might not be entirely able to moder-
ate his or her emotional reactions.11
Considering this association, it is not surprising that a 
recent (2009) survey examining the association between 
early incidence of animal cruelty and later involvement with 
violence found that aggressive men had a long history of

334  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Substance Abuse
Substance abuse has been associated 
with violence on both the individual 
and social levels: substance abusers have 
higher rates of violence than nonabus-
ers; neighborhoods with high levels of 
substance abuse have higher violence 
rates when compared to areas with low 
use rates.18 A direct association has been 
found between community levels of 
crack cocaine and heroin use and the 
incidence of street robberies.19 High use 
areas may also face social disorganiza-
tion, poverty, and unemployment, fac-
tors that further escalate violence rates.20
The link between substance abuse 
and violence appears in three different 
formats21:
■    Psychopharmacological relationship. 
Violence may be the direct conse-
quence of ingesting mood-altering 
substances. Experimental evidence 
shows that high doses of drugs 
such as PCP and amphetamines 
produce violent, aggressive behav-
ior.22 For example, binge drinking 
has been closely associated with 
violent crime rates.23 Heavy drink-
ing reduces cognitive 
 ability, information processing skills, and the ability to 
process and react to verbal and nonverbal behavior. As 
a result, miscommunication becomes more likely and 
the capacity for rational dialogue is compromised.24 It 
is not surprising that males involved in sexual assaults 
often claim that they were drinking and misunderstood 
their victims’ intentions.25 Drinking becomes particu-
larly dangerous when abusers have access to fi rearms; 
guns and alcohol do not mix well.26
Economic compulsive behavior.
 
■
 Drug users resort to violence 
to obtain the fi nancial resources to support their habit. 
Studies conducted in the United States and Europe show 
that addicts commit hundreds of crimes each year.27
Systemic link. 
 
■
Violence escalates when drug-dealing 
gangs fl ex their muscle to dominate territory and drive 
out rivals. Studies of gangs that sell drugs show that 
their violent activities may result in a signifi cant propor-
tion of all urban homicides.28
Socialization and Upbringing
Another view is that improper socialization and upbringing are 
responsible for the onset of violent acts. Absent or deviant par-
ents, inconsistent discipline, physical abuse, and lack of super-
vision have all been linked to persistent violent offending.29
Collins finds that the myth that humans enjoy blood-
shed is perpetuated by media depictions of violence. Take 
for instance the barroom brawl shown in numerous fi lms. A 
fi ght breaks out in a bar and soon everyone joins in, joyously 
punching each other and breaking up the premises. When 
the crowd doesn’t join in, they generally will make a space 
for the individuals to fi ght, cheering and shouting encourage-
ment. Fights are drawn out with two evenly matched oppo-
nents punching each other for long periods of combat. While 
normative in the movies, Collins points out that these events 
never actually happen in real life. When a fi ght does break 
out, most patrons typically back away to a safe distance and 
watch, shrinking away as far as possible. Rather than shout-
ing encouragement, onlookers tend to withdraw vocally as 
well as physically. And rather than drawn-out brawls, fi ghts 
are over quickly, typically with a single punch. Most brawlers 
are willing to quit without a clear-cut victory as soon as a few 
punches are launched. When there is a group brawl, it’s be-
cause sides had been chosen beforehand based on social and 
political views or even sports team loyalty. In these instances, 
the “free-for-all” that may look chaotic and unstructured to 
outsiders is actually carefully organized. Prior organization, 
group identity, and support, Collins fi nds, are what enables 
individuals to overcome their own pervasive fear of violence 
and confrontation; if it were not well organized, wide-partic-
ipation group fi ghting would not be possible.17
While rates of violent crime are higher in the United States than in most other Western nations, 
violence abroad is not unknown. One of the most catastrophic incidents occurred in the village 
of Dunblane, Scotland, on July 8, 1996, when heavily armed Thomas Hamilton walked onto 
the grounds of St. Luke’s Infant School and began to methodically shoot children in this 
kindergarten class. Sixteen children and their teacher were killed. The Dunblane massacre 
prompted the passage of legislation to control handguns in Scotland and England, which failed 
to please some critics who felt there should be an outright ban on the possession of guns.

CHAPTER 10 | Interpersonal Violence  335
Although infants demonstrate individual temperaments, 
who they become may have a lot to do with how they are 
treated during their early years. Some children are harder 
to soothe than others; in some cases, diffi cult infant tem-
perament has been associated with later aggression and be-
havioral problems.30 Parents who fail to set adequate limits 
or to use proper, consistent discipline reinforce a child’s co-
ercive behavior.31 The effects of inadequate parenting and 
early rejection may affect violent behavior throughout life.32 
There is evidence that children who are maltreated and ne-
glected in early childhood are the ones most likely to be ini-
tiated into criminality and thereafter continue or persist in a 
criminal career.33
There are also indications that children who are subject 
to even minimal amounts of physical punishment may be 
more likely one day to use violence themselves.34 Sociolo-
gist Murray Straus reviewed the concept of discipline in a 
series of surveys and found a powerful relationship between 
exposure to physical punishment and later aggression.35 The 
effect of physical punishment may be mediated or neutral-
ized to some extent if parents also provide support, warmth, 
and care. When kids experience physical punishment in the 
absence of parental involvement, they feel angry and un-
justly treated and are more willing to defy their parents and 
engage in antisocial behavior.36
Abused Children A number of research studies have 
found that children who are clinically diagnosed as abused 
later engage in delinquent behaviors, including violence, at 
a rate signifi cantly greater than that of children who were 
not abused.37 Samples of convicted murderers reveal a high 
percentage of seriously abused youth.38 The abuse–violence 
association has been established in many cases in which par-
ents have been killed by their children; sexual abuse is also a 
constant factor in father (patricide) and mother (matricide) 
killings.39 Lewis found in her study of juvenile death row 
inmates that all had long histories of intense child abuse.40
Abuse may have the greatest effect if it is persistent and 
extends from childhood to adolescence.41 Children who are 
physically punished by their parents are likely to physically 
abuse a sibling and later engage in spousal abuse and other 
forms of criminal violence.42 There is evidence that spousal 
batterers received signifi cantly less love and more punish-
ment from their mothers than did men in a general popula-
tion comparison group. Abusive childhood experiences may 
be a key factor in the later development of relationship aggres-
sion.43 Lonnie Athens, a well-known criminologist who links 
violence to early experiences with child abuse, has coined the 
phrase violentization process to describe how abused kids 
are turned into aggressive adults.44 The stages of this process 
are described in Exhibit 10.1. Athens recognizes that abuse 
alone is not a suffi cient condition to cause someone to be-
come a dangerous violent criminal. One must complete the 
full cycle of the violentization process—brutalization, bel-
ligerence, violent performances, and virulency—to become 
socialized into violence. Many brutalized children do not go 
EXHIBIT 10.1
Stages in the Violentization Process
 1. Brutalization stage. During this phase of the violentization 
process, a young victim develops a belligerent, angry de-
meanor as a result of being mistreated by abusive parents 
or caretakers. Brutalization can be broader than paren-
tal physical or sexual abuse and can result from violent 
coaching by peers, neighbors, and schoolmates. Although 
most brutalization occurs early in life, some people can be 
brutalized as they mature. There are a number of facets in 
the brutalization stage:
Violent subjugation.
 
■
 A person is coerced into 
compliance by physical or verbal force. Coercive 
violence ends at submission, but retaliatory violence 
continues regardless of submission, with the goal of 
gaining long-term submission.
Personal horrification.
 
■
 An individual is exposed to 
violence directed at someone else close to them, 
leading to inner conflict and guilt associated with their 
helplessness to do anything about the abuse.
Violent coaching.
 
■
 A brutalizer, through ridicule, threats, 
or coercion, advises the brutalized individual to depend 
only on his or her self, encourages defensiveness, 
and insists that they have a personal responsibility to 
commit violence.
 2. Belligerency stage. During this stage, the target of brutal-
ization begins to understand their dilemma. At first they 
may wonder, “Why can’t I stop this violence and brutaliza-
tion?” Then they begin a cognitive process in which they 
conclude that sometimes violence is a necessary evil in the 
world. They think, “Why have I not done anything to stop 
my own and my intimates’ violent subjugation?” They then 
conclude that resorting to violence is sometimes necessary 
in this world.
 3. Violent performance stage. Brutalized youth may become 
belligerent and angry. When confronted at home, school, 
or on the street, these belligerent youth respond with vio-
lent performances of angry, hostile behavior. The success 
of their violent confrontations provides them with a sense 
of power and achievement.
 4. Virulency stage. The emerging criminal develops a 
violent identity that makes them feared; they enjoy in-
timidating others. Filled with feelings of exultancy, the 
brutalized person believes they can perform even more 
impressive violent feats in the future. They believe they 
are now invincible. This process takes violent youths 
full circle from being the victims of aggression to being 
its initiators; they are now the same person they grew 
up despising, ready to begin the process with their own 
children.

of pathways to violence among 7,000 Chicago area people 
in 80 randomly selected neighborhoods.48 Interviews with 
youths aged 9 to 15 show that large numbers of these chil-
dren have been victims of or witnesses to violence and that 
many carry weapons.
Between 30 and 40 percent of the children who re-
ported exposure to violence also displayed signifi cant vio-
lent behavior themselves. Earls fi nds that young teens who 
witness gun violence are more than twice as likely as non-
witnesses to commit violent crime themselves in the fol-
lowing years.49 Even a single exposure to fi rearm violence 
doubles the chance that a young person will later engage in 
violent behavior.
Children living in these conditions become crusted 
over: they do not let people inside, nor do they express their 
feelings. They exploit others and in turn are exploited by 
those older and stronger; as a result, they develop a sense of 
hopelessness. They fi nd that parents and teachers focus on 
their failures and problems, not their achievements. Conse-
quently, they are vulnerable to the lure of delinquent gangs 
and groups.50
Cultural Values/Subculture 
of Violence
Violence may be the product of cultural be-
liefs, values, and behaviors that develop in 
poor and disorganized neighborhoods.51 To 
explain this phenomenon, criminologists Mar-
vin Wolfgang and Franco Ferracuti formulated 
the famous concept that some areas contain an 
independent subculture of violence.52
The subculture of violence’s norms are 
separate from society’s central, dominant value 
system. In this subculture, a potent theme of 
violence infl uences lifestyles, the socialization 
process, and interpersonal relationships. Even 
though the subculture’s members share some of 
the dominant culture’s values, they expect that 
violence will be used to solve social confl icts 
and dilemmas. In some cultural subgroups, 
then, violence has become legitimized by cus-
tom and norms. It is considered appropriate 
behavior within culturally defi ned confl ict sit-
uations in which an individual who has been 
offended by a negative outcome in a dispute 
seeks reparations through violent means—a 
concept referred to as disputatiousness.53
There is evidence that a subculture of vio-
lence may be found in areas that experience 
concentrated poverty and social disorganiza-
tion.54 Though most people abhor violence, in-
come inequality and racial disparity may help 
instill a sense of hopelessness that nourishes 
on to become violent criminals, and some later reject the fact 
that they were abused as youths and redefi ne their early years 
as normative.
Exposure to Violence
People who are constantly exposed to violence in the environ-
ment may adopt violent methods themselves. Children living 
in areas marked by extreme violence may eventually become 
desensitized to the persistent brutality.45 Much of the differ-
ence in violent crime rates between whites and racial minori-
ties can be explained by the fact that the latter are often forced 
to live in high-crime neighborhoods, which increases their 
risk of exposure to violence.46 Areas where people have little 
confi dence in the police and are therefore reluctant to call for 
help—a condition common in the minority community—
may also experience higher levels of violent behavior.47
Social scientist Felton Earls and his associates con-
ducted the Project on Human Development in Chicago 
Neighborhoods, a government-funded longitudinal study 
On January 8, 2011, in an incident that shocked the nation, a mass shooting occurred 
at a political meeting near Tucson, Arizona. A 22-year-old Tucson man, Jared Lee 
Loughner, used an automatic weapon to kill six people and wound 14 others before 
being subdued by onlookers. His target was U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, 
who was meeting with constituents in a Safeway supermarket parking lot. Among those 
killed were John Roll, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for Arizona, and Christina 
Green, a 9-year-old girl who had wanted to attend the rally. Giffords was severely 
wounded; she is shown here being taken to the hospital directly after the attack. 
Federal prosecutors quickly filed charges against Loughner, including the attempted 
assassination of a member of Congress. Investigators found notes in his home that 
indicated an intent to assassinate Giffords. While Loughner appeared highly disturbed, 
many commentators linked his violent outburst to political attacks by national 
commentators on liberal lawmakers. How can such an outburst be explained? Was it a 
hate crime directed against someone whom Loughner considered a threat to his way of 
life? A product of a deranged personality? And importantly, was this attack an isolated 
incident or are we in danger of becoming a culture of politically motivated violence?

behavior quickly escalates; after they leave, it significantly 
declines.61 A recent study by Andrew Papachristos of gang 
homicide supports the association between cultural values 
and violence.62 Papachristos fi nds that members do not kill 
because they are poor, young, or live in a socially disadvan-
taged neighborhood, but rather because they live in a culture 
that maintains norms conducive to violent retaliation. When 
a gang boy kills a rival, murders spread through a process of 
social contagion as gangs are forced to respond in order to 
maintain their social status and honor through a display of 
solidarity. The culture that houses gangs associates honor with 
hypermasculinity and the use of violence to protect reputa-
tion. Because formal social control (i.e., the police) is absent in 
gang areas, violence is condoned or promoted as an acceptable 
form of social control. The need to conform to cultural values 
and to protect the gang’s rep is more important than individual 
thoughts and feelings. While some may link gang violence to 
“turf wars,” disputes that lead to murder are less about a parcel 
of land than about a gang’s status and perceived dominance. 
The Thinking Like a Criminologist feature focuses on the life 
of a gang boy and asks the question “Can he be saved?”
National Values Some nations—including the United 
States, Sri Lanka, Angola, Uganda, and the Philippines—have 
relatively high violence rates; others are much more peace-
ful. According to research by sociologist Jerome Neapolitan, a 
pro-violence norms and values.55 In these areas people are 
more likely to carry weapons and use them in assaults and 
robberies. Victims are aware of these tactics and are less 
likely to fi ght back forcibly when attacked.56 However, when 
pressed to the limit even passive victims may eventually fi ght 
back. When Charis Kubrin and Ronald Weitzer studied ho-
micide in St. Louis, Missouri, they discovered that a certain 
type of killing referred to as cultural retaliatory homicide is 
common in neighborhoods that suffer economic disadvan-
tage. In these areas, residents resolve interpersonal confl icts 
informally—without calling the police—even if it means kill-
ing their opponent; neighbors understand and support their 
violent methods.57  Because police and other agencies of for-
mal social control are viewed as weak and devalued, under-
staffed and/or corrupt, people are willing to take matters into 
their own hands and violence rates increase accordingly.58
The Gang Subculture Empirical evidence shows that 
violence rates are highest in urban areas where subcultural 
values support teenage gangs whose members typically 
embrace the use of violence.59 Gang boys are more likely 
to own guns and other weapons than non–gang members. 
They are also more likely to have peers who are gun owners 
and are more likely to carry guns outside the home.60
While many boys are predisposed toward violence before 
joining a gang, research shows that once in gangs their violent 
The story of prison inmate Juan Suarez is an all-
too-familiar account of a life filled with displace-
ment, poverty, and chronic predatory crime. The 
illegitimate son of a Cuban prostitute in Havana, 
Suarez was sent to a juvenile reformatory for 
robbery at the age of 9. After returning home, 
he lived with his mother and stepfather, who 
routinely abused him and sold him to child 
pornographers who used him in sex films with 
adults. He has told friends that getting a full 
meal in his childhood was a rare treat.
Suarez emigrated to the United States and soon after became 
a street thug in Chicago, where he joined the Latin Kings, the city’s 
most notorious gang. After moving to the Bronx, Suarez shot and 
killed his girlfriend. Sentenced to 20 years to life for aggravated 
manslaughter, Juan Suarez ended up at Collins Correctional Fa-
cility in Helmuth, New York, where he started a New York prison 
chapter of the Latin Kings. Even while he was in prison segregation, 
authorities believe he was able to order the leader of the Latin Kings 
in New York’s Rikers Island jail to attack a rival; the victim died after 
being stabbed. Suarez was then convicted on second-degree mur-
der for ordering the hit.
Suarez now spends 23 hours a day in a 
7-by-12-foot cell, allowed one hour to run in a 
hall outside his cell in a maximum security fa-
cility. As his parole date approaches, the head 
of rehabilitation services at the institution has 
evaluated Suarez and is convinced that he is 
above average intelligence and can benefit from 
community release. In her report, she notes that 
Suarez is now over 40 years old and has ma-
tured and seems ready for change. She recom-
mends that he be made eligible for a program that 
would allow him to leave the prison grounds for up to 10 hours a 
day. He would return to the prison at night but would be placed in 
the general population. If the program is successful, he could be 
given conditional early parole.
❯❯ The governor has asked you to investigate the case and 
make a written recommendation to the parole board. As a 
criminologist, do you believe that someone like Juan Suarez 
can change and forego a life of violence? Would you recom-
mend granting him early release, a special treatment denied 
to his victims?

338  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
On April 12, 2009, a Jordanian man con-
fessed to stabbing to death his pregnant 
sister and mutilating her body to protect 
the family honor. The 28-year-old married 
woman, who was five months pregnant, was 
stabbed repeatedly in the face, neck, abdo-
men, and back and then hacked up with a 
meat cleaver. She had moved back in with 
her family after an argument with her hus-
band six months earlier. The brother believed 
that she had then started seeing other men 
and had gotten pregnant out of wedlock.
Honor killing and honor crime involve 
violence against women and girls, including 
such acts as beating, battering, or killing, 
by a family member or relative. The attacks 
are provoked by the belief or perception 
that an individual’s or family’s honor has 
been threatened because of the actual or 
perceived sexual misconduct of the female. 
Honor killings are most common in tradi-
tional societies in the Middle East, South-
west Asia, India, China, and Latin America. 
However, the custom is now being exported 
around the world: in a crime that outraged 
Germany, a 24-year-old man, identified 
as Ahmad-Sobair O., killed his sister Mor-
sal on May 15, 2008. He said he had ob-
jected to the pretty schoolgirl’s lifestyle, 
her clothing, and her attempts to distance 
herself from her family. And Germany is not 
alone. In 2008, Yaser Abdel Said took his 
two teenaged daughters for a ride in his taxi 
cab, under the guise of taking them to get 
something to eat, then drove them to Irving, 
Texas, where he allegedly shot both girls to 
death. The reason: for dating boys against 
his will.
Honor killing of a woman or girl by her 
father, brother, or other male relative may 
occur because of a suspicion that she en-
gaged in sexual activities before or outside 
marriage and thus has dishonored the fam-
ily. Even when rape of a woman or girl has 
occurred this may be seen as a violation of 
the honor of the family for which the female 
must be killed. Wives’ adultery and daugh-
ters’ premarital “sexual activity,” including 
rape, are seen as extreme violations of the 
codes of behavior and thus may result in 
the death of the female through this so-
called “honor” killing. Honor killing/crime is 
based on the shame that a loss of control of 
the woman or girl brings to the family and 
to the male heads of the family.
According to criminologist Linda Wil-
liams, men consider honor killings culturally 
necessary because any suspicion of sexual 
activity or suspicion that a girl or a woman 
was touched by another in a sexual manner 
is enough to raise questions about the fam-
ily’s honor. Consequently, strict control of 
women and girls within the home and out-
side the home is justified. Women are re-
stricted in their activities in the community, 
religion, and politics. These institutions, in 
turn, support the control of females. Wil-
liams believes that the existence of honor 
killing is designed for maintaining male 
dominance. Submissiveness may be seen 
as a sign of sexual purity, and a woman’s 
or girl’s attempts to assert her rights can 
be seen as a violation of the family’s honor 
that needs to be redressed. Rules of honor 
and threats against females who “violate” 
such rules reinforce the control of women 
and have a powerful impact on their lives. 
Honor killings/crimes serve to keep women 
and girls from “stepping out of line.” The 
manner in which such behaviors silence 
women and kill their spirit has led some to 
label honor killings/crimes more broadly as 
“femicide.”
CRITICAL THINKING
While we may scoff at honor killings, are 
there elements of American culture and life 
that you consider harmful to women yet are 
still tolerated? What can be done to change 
them?

number of national characteristics are predictive of violence, 
including a high level of social disorganization, economic 
stress, high child abuse rates, approval of violence by the 
government, political corruption, and an ineffi cient justice 
system.63 Children in high-violence nations are likely to be 
economically deprived and socially isolated, exposed to con-
stant violence, and lacking in hope and respect for the law. 
Guns are common in these nations because, lacking an ef-
fi cient justice system, people arm themselves or hire private 
security forces for protection.64 In contrast, nations such as 
Japan have relatively low violence rates because of cultural 
and economic strengths. Japan boasts a system of exception-
ally effective informal social controls that help reduce crime. 
It also has had a robust economy that may alleviate the 
stresses that produce violence.65 The Race, Culture, Gender, 
and Criminology feature “The Honor Killing of Women and 
Girls” discusses one type of culturally based violent crime.
Does the United States maintain values that promote vi-
olence? According to historian David Courtwright, relatively 
high violence rates in the United States can be traced to a 
frontier culture that was characterized by racism and pre-
occupation with personal honor.66 Westerners drank heav-
ily and frequented saloons and gambling halls, where petty 
arguments could become lethal because most patrons car-
ried guns and knives. Violent acts often went unpunished 
because law enforcement agencies were unable or unwilling

CHAPTER 10 | Interpersonal Violence  339
History of Rape
Rape has been a recognized crime throughout history. It 
has been the subject of art, literature, fi lm, and theater. 
Paintings such as the Rape of the Sabine Women by Nico-
las Poussin, novels such as Clarissa by Samuel Richardson, 
poems such as The Rape of Lucrece by William Shakespeare, 
and fi lms such as The Accused and The Last House on the 
Left have sexual violence as their central theme.
In early civilization rape was common. Men staked a 
claim of ownership on women by forcibly abducting and rap-
ing them. This practice led to males’ solidifi cation of power 
and their historical domination of women.72 Under Babylo-
nian and Hebraic law, the rape of a virgin was a crime punish-
able by death. However, if the victim was married, then both 
she and her attacker were considered equally to blame, and 
unless her husband intervened, both were put to death.
During the Middle Ages, it was common for ambitious 
men to abduct and rape wealthy women in an effort to force 
them into marriage. The practice of “heiress stealing” illus-
trates how feudal law gave little thought or protection to 
women and equated them with property.73 Only in the late 
fi fteenth century, after a monetary economy developed, was 
forcible sex outlawed. Thereafter, the violation of a virgin 
caused an economic hardship on her family, who expected 
a signifi cant dowry for her hand in marriage. However, the 
to take action. The popu-
lation of the frontier was 
mostly young bachelors who 
were sensitive about honor, 
morally indifferent, heavily 
armed, and unchecked by 
adequate law enforcement. 
Many died from disease, but 
others succumbed to drink 
and violence. Smoking, 
gambling, and heavy drink-
ing became a cultural imper-
ative, and those who were 
disinclined to indulge were 
considered social outcasts. 
Courtwright claims that over 
time gender ratios equal-
ized as more men brought 
families to the frontier and 
children of both sexes were 
born. Many men died, re-
turned home, or drifted else-
where. By the mid-twentieth 
century, America’s overall 
male surplus was disappear-
ing, and a balanced popula-
tion helped bring down the 
crime rate, but remnants of 
the frontier mentality still 
exist in contemporary American society.

FORCIBLE RAPE
Rape (from the Latin rapere, to take by force) is defi ned in 
common law as “the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly 
and against her will.”67 It is one of the most loathed, mis-
understood, and frightening crimes. Under traditional com-
mon-law defi nitions, rape involves nonconsensual sexual 
intercourse that a male performs against a female he is nei-
ther married to nor cohabitating with.68 There are of course 
other forms of sexual assault, including male on male, fe-
male on female, and female on male sexual assaults, but 
these are not considered within the traditional defi nition of 
rape.69 However, recognizing changing contemporary stan-
dards, almost every state has now revised their rape stat-
utes, making them gender neutral.70 In addition, states now 
recognize that rape can occur among married couples and 
people who previously have been sexually intimate.71

Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665), which hangs in the Louvre in Paris. In early civilization men staked a claim

power and their historical domination of women.

law only applied to the wealthy; peasant women and mar-
ried women were not considered rape victims until well into 
the sixteenth century. The Christian condemnation of sex 
during this period was also a denunciation of women as evil, 
having lust in their hearts, and redeemable only by mother-
hood. A woman who was raped was almost automatically 
suspected of contributing to her attack.
Rape and the Military
The link between the military and rape is inescapable. 
Throughout recorded history, rape has been associated with 
armies and warfare. Soldiers of conquering armies have 
considered sexual possession of their enemies’ women one 
of the spoils of war. Among the ancient Greeks, rape was 
socially acceptable within the rules of warfare. During the 
Crusades, even knights and pilgrims, ostensibly bound by 
vows of chivalry and Christian piety, took time to rape as 
they marched toward Constantinople.
The belief that women are part of the spoils of war has 
continued. During World War II, the Japanese army forced 
as many as 200,000 Korean women into frontline brothels, 
where they were repeatedly raped. In a 1998 Japanese rul-
ing, the surviving Korean women were awarded the equiva-
lent of $2,300 each in compensation.74 The systematic rape 
of Bosnian and Kosovar women by Serbian army officers 
during the civil war in the former Yugoslavia horrifi ed the 
world during the 1990s. These crimes seemed particularly 
atrocious because they appeared to be part of an offi cial pol-
icy of genocide: rape was deliberately used to impregnate 
Bosnian women with Serbian children.
On March 9, 1998, Dragoljub Kunarac, 37, a former 
Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander, admitted before an 
international tribunal in the Netherlands that he had raped 
Muslim women during the Bosnian war in 1992. His con-
fession made him the fi rst person to plead guilty to rape as a 
war crime.75 Human rights groups have estimated that more 
than 30,000 women and young girls were sexually abused 
in the Balkan fi ghting.
Though shocking, the war crimes discovered in Bosnia 
have not deterred conquering armies from using rape as a 
weapon. In 2004, pro-government militias in the Darfur re-
gion of Sudan were accused of using rape and other forms 
of sexual violence “as a weapon of war” to humiliate black 
African women and girls as well as the rebels fi ghting the 
Sudanese government in Khartoum.76
Incidence of Rape
According to the most recent UCR data (2009), about 88,000 
rapes or attempted rapes are now being reported to U.S. po-
lice each year, a rate of about 30 per 100,000 inhabitants.77 
Like other violent crimes, the rape rate has been in a decade-
long decline, and the 2009 totals are signifi cantly below 1992 
levels, when 84 women per 100,000 were rape victims.
While the overwhelming percentage of rape victims are 
female, thousands of men report being sexually assaulted 
each year. One significant difference: while women most 
often are attacked by strangers, almost every male rape in-
volve a friend or acquaintance.78
Population density infl uences the rape rate. Metropoli-
tan areas today have rape rates signifi cantly higher than ru-
ral areas; nonetheless, urban areas have experienced a much 
greater drop in rape reports than rural areas. The police make 
arrests in slightly more than half of all reported rape offenses. 
Of the offenders arrested, typically about half are under 25 
years of age, and about two-thirds are white. The racial and 
age pattern of rape arrests has been fairly consistent for some 
time. Finally, rape is a warm-weather crime—most incidents 
occur during July and August, with the lowest rates occur-
ring during December, January, and February.
These data must be interpreted with caution because 
rape is a traditionally under-reported crime. Some crimi-
nologists estimate that as many as 10 percent of all adult 
women may have been raped during their lifetime.79 Ac-
cording to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), 
more than 100,000 rapes and attempted rapes take place 
each year, suggesting that a considerable number of rape in-
cidents are not reported to police.80
Why is rape, one of the most serious violent crimes, also 
one of the most under-reported? Many victims fail to report 
rapes because they are embarrassed, believe nothing can be 
done, or blame themselves. Some victims of sexual assaults 
may even question whether they have really been raped; re-
search indicates that when the assault involves an acquain-
tance, such as a boyfriend, and the victim had been drinking 
or taking drugs, they are unlikely to label their situations 
as being a “real” rape. Similarly, if the assault involved oral 
or digital sex it was less likely to be labeled a “real” rape.81 
Women are more likely to report rape when it is committed 
by a stranger who uses a weapon or causes physical injury, 
or when the rape occurred in a public place—or if at home, 
was the result of “home blitz” (in which an attacker broke in 
or entered without permission).82 Therefore it is likely that 
many acquaintance rapes and date rapes go unreported.
There may be many more rape victims than the offi cial 
data allow.83 But even if victims fail to acknowledge that 
their attack was “real” and refuse to report it to the police, 
the experience can have devastating psychological effects 
that last long after the attack has been completed.84
Types of Rape and Rapists
Some rapes are planned, others are spontaneous; some focus 
on a particular victim, whereas others occur almost as an af-
terthought during the commission of another crime, such 
as a burglary. Some rapists commit a single crime, whereas 
others are multiple offenders; some attack alone, and others 
engage in group or gang rapes.85 Some use force to attack 
their target, others prey upon those who are incapacitated 
by drugs and alcohol.86 Because there is no single type of

CHAPTER 10 | Interpersonal Violence  341
Research by Janet Warren and her associates determined 
that increasers (about 25 percent of serial rapists) tend to 
be white males who attack multiple victims who are typi-
cally older than the norm. During these attacks, the rapist 
uses excessive profanity and takes more time than during 
typical rapes. Increasers have a limited criminal history for 
other crimes, a fact suggesting that their behavior is focused 
almost solely on sexual violence.90
Some serial rapists commit “blitz rapes,” in which they 
attack their victims without warning, whereas others try to 
“capture” their victims by striking up a conversation or of-
fering them a ride. Others use personal or professional rela-
tionships to gain access to their targets.91
Acquaintance Rape Acquaintance rape involves some-
one known to the victim, including family members and 
friends. Included within acquaintance rapes are the sub-
categories of date rape, which involves a sexual attack 
during a courting relationship; statutory rape, in which 
the victim is underage; and marital rape, which is forc-
ible sex between people who are legally married to each 
other.92 It is diffi cult to estimate the ratio between rapes 
involving strangers and those in which victim and assailant 
are in some way acquainted because women may be more 
reluctant to report acts involving acquaintances. By some 
estimates, about 50 percent of rapes involve acquaintances, 
a number that is not surprising considering the prevalence 
of negative attitudes toward women and attitudes that sup-
port sexual coercion among some groups of young men.93 
Stranger rapes are typically more violent than acquaintance 
rapes; attackers are more likely to carry a weapon, threaten 
the victim, and harm her physically. Stranger rapes may 
also be less likely to be prosecuted than acquaintance rapes 
because victims may be more reluctant to recount their or-
deal at trial if the attack involved a stranger than if their 
attacker was someone they knew or had been involved with 
in an earlier relationship.94
Date Rape Date rape was fi rst identifi ed as a signifi cant 
social problem in the 1980s when Mary Koss conducted 
surveys fi nding that a signifi cant number of college-age 
women had been sexually assaulted by a dating partner; 
about 27 percent of the respondents were the victim of 
rape or attempted rape. However, only about a quarter of 
the women considered what had happened to them “real” 
rape; the majority either blamed themselves or denied 
they had really been raped.95 The Koss research helped 
identify a social problem that all too long had remained 
below the radar.
There is no single form of date rape. Some occur on 
fi rst dates, others after a relationship has been developing, 
and still others occur after the couple has been involved 
for some time. In long-term or close relationships, the male 
partner may feel he has invested so much time and money 
in his partner that he is owed sexual relations or that sexual 
intimacy is an expression that the involvement is progress-
ing. He may make comparisons to other couples who have 
rape or rapist, criminologists have attempted to defi ne and 
categorize the vast variety of rape situations.
Criminologists now recognize that there are numerous mo-
tivations for rape and as a result various types of rapists. One 
of the best-known attempts to classify the personalities of rap-
ists was made by psychologist A. Nicholas Groth, an expert on 
classifying and treating sex offenders. According to Groth, ev-
ery rape encounter contains at least one of these three elements: 
anger, power, and sadism.87 Consequently, rapists can be clas-
sifi ed according to one of the three dimensions described in 
Exhibit 10.2. In treating rape offenders, Groth found that about 
55 percent were of the power type; about 40 percent, the anger 
type; and about 5 percent, the sadistic type.88
Gang Rape Research studies estimates that as many as 
25 percent or more of rapes involve multiple offenders.89 
There is generally little difference in the demographic char-
acteristics of single- or multiple-victim rapes. However, 
women who are attacked by multiple offenders are subject 
to more violence, such as beatings and the use of weapons, 
and the rapes are more likely to be completed than indi-
vidual rapes. Gang rape victims are more likely to resist and 
face injury than those attacked by single offenders. They are 
more likely to call police, to seek therapy, and to contem-
plate suicide. Gang rapes then, as might be expected, are 
more severe in violence and outcome.
Serial Rape Some rapists are one-time offenders, but 
others engage in multiple or serial rapes. Some serial rap-
ists constantly increase their use of force; others do not. 
EXHIBIT 10.2 
Varieties of Forcible Rape
Anger rape.
 
■
 This rape occurs when sexuality becomes a 
means of expressing and discharging pent-up anger and 
rage. The rapist uses far more brutality than would have 
been necessary if his real objective had been simply to have 
sex with his victim. His aim is to hurt his victim as much as 
possible; the sexual aspect of rape may be an afterthought.
Power rape.
 
■
 This type of rape involves an attacker who 
does not want to harm his victim as much as he wants to 
possess her sexually. His goal is sexual conquest, and he 
uses only the amount of force necessary to achieve his 
objective. The power rapist wants to be in control, to be 
able to dominate women and have them at his mercy.
Sadistic rape.
 
■
 This type of rape involves both sexuality 
and aggression. The sadistic rapist is caught up in 
ritual—he may torment his victim, bind her, or torture 
her. Victims are usually related, in the rapist’s view, to a 
personal characteristic that he wants to harm or destroy.

342  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
U.S. courts; more than 100 nations have abolished the mari-
tal exemption.106 However, although marital rape is now 
recognized, most states do not give wives the same legal 
protection as they would nonmarried couples, and when 
courts do recognize marital rape, the perpetrators are sanc-
tioned less harshly than are those accused of nonmarital 
sexual assaults.107 For example, in 30 states, a husband is 
exempt from charges of rape when he does not have to use 
force; because of the marital contract, a wife’s consent is as-
sumed unless she overtly refuses her husband’s advances. 
The existence of some spousal exemptions in the majority 
of states indicates that rape in marriage is still treated as a 
lesser crime than other forms of rape.108
Statutory Rape The term statutory rape refers to sexual re-
lations between an underage minor and an adult. Although 
the sex is not forced or coerced, the law says that young 
people are incapable of giving informed consent, so the act is 
legally considered nonconsensual. Typically a state’s law will 
defi ne an age of consent above which there can be no crimi-
nal prosecution for sexual relations. Although each state is 
different, most evaluate the age differences between the par-
ties to determine whether an offense has taken place. For 
example, Indiana law mandates prosecution of men aged 21 
or older who have consensual sex with girls younger than 
14. In some states, defendants can claim they mistakenly as-
sumed their victims were above the age of consent, whereas 
in others, “mistake-of-age” defenses are ignored. An Ameri-
can Bar Association (ABA) survey found that prosecution is 
often diffi cult in statutory rape cases because the young vic-
tims are reluctant to testify. Often parents have given their 
blessing to the relationships, and juries are reluctant to con-
vict men involved in consensual sex even with young teen-
aged girls.109
The Causes of Rape
What factors predispose some men to commit rape? Crimi-
nologists’ responses to this question are almost as varied as 
the crime itself. However, most explanations can be grouped 
into a few consistent categories.
Evolutionary, Biological Factors One explanation is that 
rape may be instinctual, developed over the ages as a means 
of perpetuating the species. In more primitive times, forc-
ible sexual contact may have helped spread genes and maxi-
mize offspring. Some believe that these prehistoric drives 
remain: males still have a natural sexual drive that encour-
ages them to have intimate relations with as many women 
as possible.110 The evolutionary view is that the sexual urge 
corresponds to the unconscious need to preserve the species 
by spreading one’s genes as widely as possible. Men who are 
sexually aggressive will have a reproductive edge over their 
more passive peers.111
dated as long and are sexually active.96 Some use a vari-
ety of strategies to coerce sex, including getting their dates 
drunk, threatening them with termination of the relation-
ship, threatening to disclose negative information, making 
them feel guilty, or uttering false promises (i.e., “we’ll get 
engaged”) to obtain sex.97
Date rape is believed to be frequent on college campuses. 
It has been estimated that 15 to 30 percent of all college 
women are victims of rape or attempted rape. One survey 
of college women found that 27 percent of the sample had 
experienced unwanted sexual contact ranging from kissing 
and petting to sexual intercourse.98
The actual incidence of date rape may be even higher 
than surveys indicate, because many victims blame them-
selves and do not recognize the incident as a rape, say-
ing, for example, “I should have fought back harder” or 
“I shouldn’t have gotten drunk.”99 Victims tend to have his-
tories of excessive drinking and prior sexuality, conditions 
which may convince them that their intemperate and/or 
immoderate behavior contributed to their own victimiza-
tion.100 Some victims do not report rapes because they do 
not view their experience as a real rape, which, they believe, 
involves a strange man “jumping out of the bushes.” Other 
victims are embarrassed and frightened. Many will tell their 
friends about their rape but refuse to let authorities know 
what happened; reporting is most common in the most seri-
ous cases, such as when a weapon is used; it is less common 
when drugs and alcohol are involved.101
Marital Rape In 1978, Greta Rideout fi led rape charges 
against her husband John. This Oregon case grabbed head-
lines because it was the fi rst in which a husband was pros-
ecuted for raping his wife while sharing a residence with 
her. John was acquitted, and the couple briefl y reconciled; 
later, continued violent episodes culminated in divorce and 
a jail term for John.102
Traditionally, a legally married husband could not be 
charged with raping his wife; this was referred to as the 
marital exemption. The origin of this legal doctrine can be 
traced to the sixteenth-century pronouncement of Matthew 
Hale, England’s chief justice, who wrote:
But the husband cannot be guilty of rape committed 
by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual 
matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given 
up herself in this kind unto the husband which she 
cannot retract.103
However, research indicates that many women are raped 
each year by their husbands as part of an overall pattern of 
spousal abuse, and they deserve the protection of the law. 
Many spousal rapes are accompanied by brutal, sadistic 
beatings and have little to do with normal sexual interests.104 
Not surprisingly, the marital exemption has undergone sig-
nifi cant revision. In 1980, only three states had laws against 
marital rape; today every state recognizes marital rape as a 
crime.105 Piercing the marital exemption is not unique to

are beaten, raped, or tortured has been linked to sexually 
aggressive behavior in men.123
Sexual Motivation Most criminologists believe rape is a 
violent act that is not sexually motivated. Yet it might be 
premature to dismiss the sexual motive from all rapes.124 
NCVS data reveal that rape victims tend to be young and 
that rapists prefer younger, presumably more attractive, vic-
tims. Data show an association between the ages of rapists 
and their victims, indicating that men choose rape targets of 
approximately the same age as consensual sex partners. And, 
although younger criminals are usually the most violent, 
older rapists tend to harm their victims more than younger 
rapists. This pattern indicates that older criminals may rape 
for motives of power and control, whereas younger offend-
ers may be seeking sexual gratifi cation and may therefore be 
less likely to harm their victims.
Rape and the Law
Unlike other crime victims, women may fi nd that their claim 
of sexual assault is greeted with some skepticism by police 
and court personnel.125 They will soon find they have to 
prove that they did not engage in sex only to have remorse 
afterwards.126 Police offi cers may be hesitant to make arrests 
and testify in court when the alleged assaults do not yield 
obvious signs of violence or struggle (presumably showing 
the victim strenuously resisted the attack). However, police 
and courts are now becoming more sensitive to the plight of 
rape victims and are just as likely to investigate acquaintance 
rapes as they are aggravated rapes involving multiple of-
fenders, weapons, and victim injuries. In some jurisdictions, 
the justice system takes all rape cases seriously and does not 
ignore those in which victim and attacker have had a prior 
relationship or those that did not involve serious injury.127
Proving Rape Proving guilt in a rape case is extremely 
challenging for prosecutors. Although the law does not 
recognize it, jurors are sometimes swayed by the insinua-
tion that the rape was victim precipitated; thus the blame is 
shifted from rapist to victim. To get a conviction, prosecutors 
must establish that the act was forced and violent and that 
no question of voluntary compliance exists. They may be re-
luctant to prosecute cases where they have questions about 
the victim’s moral character or if they believe that the victim’s 
demeanor and attitude (i.e., they were dressed provocatively) 
will turn off the jury and undermine the chance of convic-
tion.128 Prosecutors may be more willing to bring charges in 
interracial rape cases because they know that juries are more 
likely to believe victims and convict defendants in cases in-
volving interracial rape than in intraracial rapes.129
As well, there is always fear that a frightened and trauma-
tized victim may identify the wrong man, which happened 
in the case of Dennis Maher, a Massachusetts man freed after 
spending more than 19 years in prison for rapes he did not 
Male Socialization Some researchers argue that rape is 
a function of modern male socialization. Some men have 
been socialized to be aggressive with women and believe 
that the use of violence or force is legitimate if their sexual 
advances are rebuffed—that is, “women like to play hard to 
get and expect to be forced to have sex.” Those men who 
have been socialized to believe that “no means yes” are more 
likely to be sexually aggressive.112 The use of sexual violence 
is aggravated if pro-force socialization is reinforced by peer 
group members who share similar values.113
Diana Russell, a leading expert on sexual violence, sug-
gests that rape is actually not a deviant act but one that 
conforms to the qualities regarded as masculine in U.S. 
society.114 Russell maintains that from an early age boys 
are taught to be aggressive, forceful, tough, and dominat-
ing. Men are taught to dominate at the same time that they 
are led to believe that women want to be dominated. Rus-
sell describes the virility mystique—the belief that males 
must separate their sexual feelings from needs for love, 
respect, and affection. She believes men are socialized to 
be the aggressors and expect to be sexually active with 
many women; consequently, male virginity and sexual 
inexperience are shameful. Similarly, sexually aggressive 
women frighten some men and cause them to doubt their 
own masculinity. Sexual insecurity may lead some men 
to commit rape to bolster their self-image and masculine 
identity.115
Feminists suggest that as the nation moves toward gen-
der equality there may be an immediate increase in rape 
rates because of increased threats to male virility and domi-
nance. However, in the long term, gender equality will re-
duce rape rates because there will be an improved social 
climate toward women.116
Psychological Abnormality Another view is that rap-
ists suffer from some type of personality disorder or men-
tal illness. Research shows that a signifi cant percentage of 
incarcerated rapists exhibit psychotic tendencies, and many 
others have hostile, sadistic feelings toward women.117 A 
high proportion of serial rapists and repeat sexual offend-
ers exhibit psychopathic personality structures.118 There is 
evidence linking rape proclivity with narcissistic personal-
ity disorder, a pattern of traits and behaviors that indicate 
infatuation and fi xation with one’s self to the exclusion of all 
others and the egotistic and ruthless pursuit of one’s gratifi -
cation, dominance, and ambition.119
Social Learning This perspective submits that men learn 
to commit rapes much as they learn any other behavior. For 
example, sexual aggression may be learned through interac-
tion with peers who articulate attitudes supportive of sexual 
violence.120 Nicholas Groth found that 40 percent of the 
rapists he studied were sexually victimized as adolescents.121 
A growing body of literature links personal sexual trauma 
with the desire to infl ict sexual trauma on others.122 Watch-
ing violent or pornographic films featuring women who

commit. Though three victims provided eyewitness identi-
fi cation at trial, DNA testing proved that Maher could not 
have been the rapist.130 The Profi les in Crime discusses one 
of the nation’s most notorious false rape accusations.
Consent Rape represents a major legal challenge to the 
criminal justice system for a number of reasons.131 One issue 
involves the concept of consent. It is essential to prove that 
the attack was forced and that the victim did not give volun-
tary consent to her attacker. In a sense, the burden of proof 
is on the victim to show that her character is beyond ques-
tion and that she in no way encouraged, enticed, or misled 
the accused rapist. On the other hand, some states, such as 
California and Illinois, now recognize that once given con-
sent can be withdrawn if a woman changes her mind about 
sex even after relations have begun. Once she says stop, the 
act must end or else a rape has occurred. Provisions of Cali-
fornia’s rape law are set out in Exhibit 10.3.
Proving victim dissent is not a requirement in any other 
violent crime. For example, robbery victims do not have to 
prove they did not entice their attackers by fl aunting expen-
sive jewelry; yet the defense counsel in a rape case can create 
reasonable doubt about the woman’s credibility. A common 
Despite initial shock, public senti-
ment began to shift as the facts of the case 
were leaked to the press. There was a lack 
of physical evidence, the victim’s story 
constantly changed, her character was 
questioned, there were changes to and 
inconsistencies in her statement, and the 
second stripper did not back up her ac-
count. The press got hold of testimony by 
a lab director that the prosecutor, Durham 
District Attorney Mike Nifong, deliberately 
withheld evidence from the defense that 
might have cleared the suspects (i.e., DNA 
from other men but not the Duke play-
ers were found on the victim’s body). On 
December 22, 2006, Nifong dropped the 
rape charges against the three indicted 
players. After ethics charges were filed 
against him, Nifong asked to be removed, 
and on January 13, 2007, North Carolina 
Attorney General Roy Cooper agreed to 
take over the case. Soon after, Duke Uni-
versity announced that Finnerty and Selig-
mann had been invited to return to school 
while they awaited trial and were eligible 
to rejoin the team (David Evans had al-
ready graduated). On April 11, 2007, all 
remaining charges were dropped against 
the three players and in an ironic turn-
about, Nifong was brought up on miscon-
duct charges, during which he abruptly 
resigned his post; he was later stripped of 
his law license.
The case is troubling because it sup-
ports the notion that a great many rape ac-
cusations are false, making it more difficult 
to prosecute and gain conviction in those 
that are valid.

The Duke Rape Case
On March 13, 2006, after a “performance” 
by strippers at a private residence, three 
members of Duke University’s men’s la-
crosse team allegedly raped one of the 
women who had been hired to entertain 
the team. The three players, David Evans, 
Reade Seligmann, and Collin Finnerty, were 
charged with first-degree forcible rape, first-
degree sexual offense, and kidnapping.
Media outlets had a field day with the 
case: the young woman was African Ameri-
can and the players white. The event soon 
drew national media attention and high-
lighted racial tensions not only in Durham, 
North Carolina, where the crime took place, 
but across the entire nation. The accused 
boys were wealthy, attractive, and success-
ful. Did they actually believe they could 
rape a poor young minority woman and get 
away with the crime because of their power 
and position? Members of the community 
demanded justice, the public voiced its 
outrage, and school officials suspended the 
accused students, dismissed the coach, 
and cancelled the lacrosse team’s season.
Profiles in Crime
Profiles in Crime
defense tactic is to introduce suspicion in the minds of the jury 
that the woman may have consented to the sexual act and later 
regretted her decision. Even the appearance of impropriety can 
undermine a case. When Kobe Bryant was accused of raping a 
young woman in 2003, the alleged victim was described in the 
press as being promiscuous, suicidal, mentally ill, a gold dig-
ger, on drugs, and so on; she was harassed by Kobe’s fans, and 
three men were actually jailed for making threats.132 When she 
refused to testify, the charges were dropped; a civil suit was 
later settled out of court. Research shows that even when a 
defendant is found guilty in a sexual assault case, punishment 
is signifi cantly reduced if the victim’s personal characteristics 
are viewed as being negative (e.g., transient, hitchhiker, gold-
digger, or substance abuser).133 Proving the victim had good 
character is not a requirement in any other crime.
Conversely, it is diffi cult for a prosecuting attorney to 
establish that a woman’s character is so impeccable that the 
absence of consent is a certainty. Such distinctions are im-
portant in rape cases because male jurors may be sympa-
thetic to the accused if the victim is portrayed as unchaste. 
Referring to the woman as “sexually liberated” or “promiscu-
ous” may be enough to result in exoneration of the accused, 
even if violence and brutality were used in the attack.134

of sexual assault.”137 Sexual assault laws outlaw any type of 
forcible sex, including homosexual rape.138
Most states and the federal government have developed 
shield laws, which protect women from being questioned 
about their sexual history unless it directly bears on the case. 
In some instances these laws are quite restrictive, whereas in 
others they grant the trial judge considerable discretion to 
admit prior sexual conduct in evidence if it is deemed rel-
evant for the defense. In an important 1991 case, Michigan v. 
Lucas, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the validity of shield 
laws and ruled that excluding evidence of a prior sexual 
relationship between the parties did not violate the defen-
dant’s right to a fair trial.139
In addition to requiring evidence that consent was not 
given, the common law of rape required corroboration that 
the crime of rape actually took place. This involved the need 
for independent evidence from police officers, physicians, 
and witnesses that the accused was actually the person who 
committed the crime, that sexual penetration took place, and 
that force was present and consent absent. This requirement 
shielded rapists from prosecution in cases where the victim 
delayed reporting the crime or in which physical evidence 
had been compromised or lost. Corroboration is no longer 
required except under extraordinary circumstances, such as 
when the victim is too young to understand the crime, has had 
a previous sexual relationship with the defendant, or gives a 
version of events that is improbable and self-contradictory.140
The federal government may have given rape victims an-
other source of redress when it passed the Violence Against 
Women Act in 1994. This statute allows rape victims to sue 
in federal court on the grounds that sexual violence violates 
their civil rights; the provisions of the act have so far been 
upheld by appellate courts.141
International Trends Rape reform is not unique to the 
United States and has become an international movement.142 
A number of nations have made rape a gender-neutral crime. 
For example, South Africa removed gender from its rape law 
in 1988, dropping the restriction that perpetrators be male 
and victims female. The Caribbean nations of Antigua and Bar-
buda dropped their marital-exclusion clause in 1995, thereaf-
ter criminalizing nonconsensual sex between a husband and 
wife. The kinds of persons and acts subject to and protected 
by rape laws have expanded dramatically. In Zimbabwe, Ar-
ticle 8 of the 2001 Sexual Offences Act punishes any kind of 
illegal sexual assault with the same kind of penalties provided 
by law for rape. With this reform, Zimbabwe greatly increased 
the range of nonconsensual sexual activities that fall under the 
umbrella of rape. There has also been an international effort to 
unify rape laws so that they apply equally to men and women 
of all classes and statuses. Take rape law in the South Ameri-
can nation of Paraguay. Until 1989, Article 315 of that nation’s 
penal code (Código Penal) set harsher penalties for the rape of 
a married woman (four to eight years in prison) than the rape 
of an unmarried woman (three to six years), even if the latter 
were “an honest woman of good name.” Why the distinction? 
When Cassia Spohn and David Holleran studied prosecu-
tors’ decisions in rape cases, they found that perception of 
the victim’s character was still a critical factor in their deci-
sion to fi le charges. In cases involving acquaintance rape, 
prosecutors were reluctant to fi le charges when the victim’s 
character was questioned—for example, when police re-
ports described the victim as sexually active or engaged in 
a sexually oriented occupation such as stripper. In cases in-
volving strangers, prosecutors were more likely to take ac-
tion if a gun or knife was used. Spohn and Holleran state 
that prosecutors are still infl uenced by perceptions of what 
constitutes “real rape” and who are “real victims.”135
Reform Because of the diffi culty rape victims have in obtain-
ing justice, rape laws have been changing around the country. 
Efforts for reform include changing the language of statutes, 
dropping the condition of victim resistance, and changing the 
requirement of use of force to include the threat of force or 
injury.136 A number of states and the federal government have 
replaced rape laws with the more gender-neutral term “crimes 
EXHIBIT 10.3 
California Rape Law
 (a)  Rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a 
person not the spouse of the perpetrator. Among the fol-
lowing circumstances sex is considered to be rape:
(1)  Where the victim is incapable, because of a mental 
disorder or developmental or physical disability, of giv-
ing legal consent.
(2)  Where sex occurred against a person’s will by means 
of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immedi-
ate and unlawful bodily injury.
(3)  Where a victim is prevented from resisting by any in-
toxicating or controlled substance.
(4)  Where a person is at the time unconscious of the na-
ture of the act.
(A) Was unconscious or asleep.
(B) Was not aware that the act occurred.
(C) Was the victim of the perpetrator’s fraud
(5)  Where a person submits under the wrongful belief 
that the person committing the act was their spouse.
(6)  Where the act is accomplished against the victim’s will 
by threatening to retaliate in the future.
(7)  Where the act is accomplished against the victim’s will 
by threatening to use the authority of a public official 
to incarcerate, arrest, or deport the victim.
(8)  It is considered rape if a man continues to have sex 
with a woman who originally consented but then 
changed her mind during the sex act.

346  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Second-degree murder requires the killer to have mal-
ice aforethought but not premeditation or deliberation. 
A second-degree murder occurs when a person’s wanton 
disregard for the victim’s life and his or her desire to infl ict 
serious bodily harm on the victim, usually with a weapon, 
results in the victim’s death.
Homicide without malice is called manslaughter and is 
usually punished by anywhere from 1 to 15 years in prison. 
Voluntary or nonnegligent manslaughter refers to a kill-
ing, typically without a weapon, committed in the heat of 
passion or during a sudden quarrel that provoked violence. 
Although intent may be present, malice is not. Involuntary 
manslaughter or negligent manslaughter refers to a killing 
that occurs when a person’s acts are negligent and without 
regard for the harm they may cause others. Most involun-
tary manslaughter cases involve motor vehicle deaths—for 
example, when a drunk driver kills a pedestrian. However, 
one can be held criminally liable for the death of another in 
any instance where disregard of safety kills.
Deliberate Indifference Murder While murder is often 
considered to be an intentional act, a person can also be 
held criminally liable for the death of another even if he or 
she did not intend to injure another person but exhibited 
deliberate indifference to the danger his or her actions might 
cause. The deliberate indifference standard is met when a 
person knows of, and yet disregards or ignores, an exces-
sive risk to an another’s health or safety. For example, dur-
ing a barroom fi ght one participant hurls a heavy beer mug 
at another, missing him but fatally hitting another patron in 
the head. Though the perpetrator had no intention of killing 
another person, he should have known that hurling a heavy 
beer mug could cause a fatal injury.
One of the most famous cases illustrating deliberate indif-
ference murder occurred on January 26, 2001, when Diane 
Whipple, a San Francisco woman, died after two large dogs at-
tacked her in the hallway of her apartment building. One of 
the dogs’ owners/keepers, Robert Noel, was found guilty of 
manslaughter and his wife Marjorie Knoller was convicted on 
charges of second-degree murder, because they knew that the 
dogs were highly dangerous but did little or nothing to control 
their behavior. Their deliberate indifference put their neighbor 
at risk with tragic consequences. After a long series of appeals, 
on June 1, 2007, the California Supreme Court ruled that a 
dog owner who knows the animal is a potential killer and ex-
poses other people to that danger may be guilty of murder even 
though he or she did not intend for that particular victim to be 
injured or killed. In a unanimous decision, the appellate court 
ruled that Knoller could be convicted of murder because she 
acted with “conscious disregard of the danger to human life.’’ 
On September 22, 2008, the court sentenced Marjorie Knoller 
to serve 15 years to life for the death of Diane Whipple.147
“Born and Alive” One issue that has received national at-
tention is whether a murder victim can be a fetus that has 
not yet been delivered; this is referred to as feticide. In some 
instances, fetal harm involves a mother whose behavior 
It was assumed that the rapist could make things right by mar-
rying his victim if she was an unmarried woman! Today, few 
codes still include such differential treatments.

MURDER AND HOMICIDE
Murder is defi ned in common law as “the unlawful killing of a 
human being with malice aforethought.”143 It is the most seri-
ous of all common-law crimes and the only one that can still 
be punished by death. Western society’s abhorrence of mur-
derers is illustrated by the fact that there is no statute of limita-
tions in murder cases. Whereas state laws limit prosecution of 
other crimes to a fi xed period, usually 7 to 10 years, accused 
killers can be brought to justice at any time after their crimes 
were committed. To legally prove that a murder has taken 
place, most state jurisdictions require prosecutors to show that 
the accused maliciously intended to kill the victim. “Express 
or actual malice” is the state of mind assumed to exist when 
someone kills another person in the absence of any apparent 
provocation. “Implied or constructive malice” is considered to 
exist when a death results from negligent or unthinking be-
havior. In these cases, even though the perpetrator did not 
wish to kill the victim, the killing resulted from an inherently 
dangerous act and therefore is considered murder. An unusual 
example of this concept is the attempted murder conviction of 
Ignacio Perea, an AIDS-infected Miami man who kidnapped 
and raped an 11-year-old boy. Perea was sentenced to up to 
25 years in prison when the jury agreed with the prosecutor’s 
contention that the AIDS virus is a deadly weapon.144
Degrees of Murder
There are different levels or degrees of homicide.145 First-
degree murder occurs when a person kills another after pre-
meditation and deliberation. Premeditation means that the 
killing was considered beforehand and suggests that it was 
motivated by more than a simple desire to engage in an act of 
violence. Deliberation means the killing was planned after 
careful thought rather than carried out on impulse: “To con-
stitute a deliberate and premeditated killing, the slayer must 
weigh and consider the question of killing and the reasons for 
and against such a choice; having in mind the consequences, 
he decides to and does kill.”146 The planning implied by this 
defi nition need not be a long process; it may be an almost 
instantaneous decision to take another’s life. Also, a killing 
accompanying a felony, such as robbery or rape, usually con-
stitutes fi rst-degree murder (felony murder).

phenomenon? Large cities experience the greatest rates of 
structural disadvantage—poverty, joblessness, racial hetero-
geneity, residential mobility, family disruption, and income 
inequality—that are linked to high murder rates.151 Not 
surprisingly, large cities are much more commonly the site 
of drug-related killings and gang-related murders, and rela-
tively less likely to be the location of family-related homi-
cides, including murders of intimates.
Murder victims and offenders tend to be males: about 
80 percent of homicide victims and nearly 90 percent of of-
fenders are male. Males are more likely to kill others of simi-
lar social standing in more public contexts; women kill family 
members and intimate partners in private locations.152
Murder, like rape, tends to be an intraracial crime: about 
90 percent of victims are slain by members of their own race. 
About half of all murder victims are African Americans. Ap-
proximately one-third of murder victims and almost half the 
offenders are under the age of 25. As  Figure 10.2 shows, the 
rate per 100,000 peaks in the 18- to 24-year-old age group, 
while adults and adolescents suffer the same murder rate.
Some murders involve very young children, a crime 
referred to as infanticide (killing older children is called 
fi licide), and others involve senior citizens, referred to as 
 eldercide.153 The UCR indicates that about 350 juveniles 
are murdered each year. The younger the child, the greater 
the risk for infanticide. At the opposite end of the age spec-
trum, less than 5 percent of all homicides involve people 
age 65 or older. Males age 65 or older are more likely than 
females of the same age to be homicide victims. Although 
most of the offenders who committed eldercide were age 50 
or younger, elderly females were more likely than elderly 
males to be killed by an elderly offender.154
Murderers typically have a long involvement in crime; 
few people begin a criminal career by killing someone. 
endangers an unborn child; in other cases, feticide results 
from the harmful action of a third party.
Some states have prosecuted women for endangering or 
killing their unborn fetuses by their drug or alcohol abuse. 
Some of these convictions have been overturned because the 
law applies only to a “human being who has been born and 
is alive.”148 However, in Whitner v. State of South Carolina, 
the Supreme Court of South Carolina ruled that a woman 
could be held liable for actions during pregnancy that could 
affect her viable fetus.149 In holding that a fetus is a “viable 
person,” the court opened the door for a potential homicide 
prosecution if a mother’s action resulted in fetal death. As 
for third-party actions, only 12 states still follow the com-
mon-law “born alive” rule: Colorado, Connecticut, Dela-
ware, Hawaii, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 
Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, and Wyoming. 
In contrast, a number of states have passed legislation creat-
ing a separate class of crime that increases criminal penalties 
when a person causes injury to a woman he or she knows is 
pregnant, and the injury results in miscarriage or stillbirth. 
At the federal level, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 
2004 makes it a separate crime to harm a fetus during an 
assault on the mother. If the attack causes death or bodily 
injury to a child who is in utero at the time the conduct takes 
place, the penalty is the same as that for conduct had the 
injury or death occurred to the unborn child’s mother.
There is still a great deal of state-to-state variation in fe-
ticide laws. Some make it a separate crime to kill a fetus or 
commit an act of violence against a pregnant woman. Oth-
ers have a viability requirement: feticide can only occur if 
the unborn child could at the time potentially have survived 
outside the mother’s body.150
The Nature and Extent of 
Murder
It is possible to track U.S. murder rate trends 
from 1900 to the present with the aid of coro-
ners’ reports and UCR data. The murder rate 
peaked in 1933, a time of high unemployment 
and lawlessness, and then fell until 1958. Then 
the homicide rate began to skyrocket, doubling 
from the mid-1960s to a peak in 1991 when 
almost 25,000 people were killed in a single 
year, a rate of about 10 per 100,000 people. 
The murder rate has since been in a decline. 
In 2009, there were about 15,500 murders, a 
rate of about 5 per 100,000 population.
What else do offi cial crime statistics tell 
us about murder today? Murder tends to be 
an urban crime. More than half of homicides 
occur in cities with a population of 100,000 
or more; almost one-quarter of homicides 
occur in cities with a population of more 
than 1 million. Why is homicide an urban

by family members than by strangers. What kind of rela-
tionships promote murder and why?
Spousal Relations As Figure 10.3 shows, intramarriage 
homicide is not unknown, though the rate of homicide 
among cohabitating couples has declined signifi cantly dur-
ing the past two decades, a fi nding that can be attributed to 
the shift away from marriage in modern society. There are, 
however, signifi cant gender differences in homicide trends 
among unmarried people. The number of unmarried men 
killed by their partners has declined (mirroring the overall 
trend in the murder rate), but the number of women killed 
by the men they live with has increased dramatically.
It is possible that men kill their spouses or partners be-
cause they fear losing control and power. Because unmar-
ried people who live together have a legally and socially 
more open relationship, males in such relationships may be 
Research shows that people arrested for homicide are signifi -
cantly more likely to have been in trouble with the law prior 
to their arrest than people arrested for other crimes.155
Today few would deny that some relationship exists 
between social and ecological factors and murder. The fol-
lowing section explores some of the more important issues 
related to these factors.
Murderous Relations
One factor that has received a great deal of attention from 
criminologists is the relationship between the murderer and 
the victim.156 As Figure 10.3 shows, a signifi cant number of 
murders involve people who knew each other beforehand, 
ranging from family members to acquaintances. In fact, in 
cases where relationships are known, more people are killed

CHAPTER 10 | Interpersonal Violence  349
Stranger Relations While in the past people tended to kill 
someone they knew or were related to, over the past decade 
the number of stranger homicides has increased. Today more 
than half of murderers are strangers to their victims, a signifi -
cant increase from years past. Stranger homicides occur most 
often as felony murders during rapes, robberies, and burglar-
ies. Others are random acts of urban violence that fuel pub-
lic fear. For example, a homeowner tells a motorist to move 
his car because it is blocking the driveway, an argument en-
sues, and the owner gets a pistol and kills the motorist; or 
consider a young boy who kills a store manager because, he 
says, “something came into my head to hurt the lady.”164
Why do stranger killings now make up a greater per-
centage of all murders than in years past? It is possible that 
tough new sentencing laws, such as the three strikes laws 
used in California and other habitual criminal statutes, are 
responsible. These laws mandate that a “three-time loser” be 
given a life sentence if convicted of multiple felonies. It is 
possible, as Tomislav Kovandzic and his associates found, 
that these laws encourage criminals to kill while committing 
burglaries and robberies. Why hesitate to kill now? If they 
are caught they will receive a life sentence anyway.165
Student Relations Sadly, violence in schools has become 
commonplace.166 According to the latest national survey of 
crime in schools, more than 2 million nonfatal crimes oc-
cur on school grounds each year, including almost 800,000 
violent acts. About 10 percent of male and 5 percent of fe-
male high school students reported being threatened or in-
jured with a weapon on school property in the past year. Of 
the violent acts, about 500,000 involved a weapon, includ-
ing 7,000 physical attacks, 600 robberies, and 4,500 rapes 
and sexual batteries.
Violence and bullying have become routine; surveys 
indicate that more than 16 percent of U.S. schoolchildren 
have been bullied by other students during the current 
school term, and approximately 30 percent of 6th- through 
10th-grade students reported being involved in some as-
pect of moderate to frequent bullying, either as a bully, the 
target of bullying, or both. Sometimes violence and bully-
ing can escalate into a school shooting, such as the Colum-
bine High School massacre, which resulted in the deaths 
of 15 people.
While relatively rare, these incidents may be expected 
because up to 10 percent of students report bringing weap-
ons to school on a regular basis.167 Many of these kids have 
a history of being abused and bullied; many perceive a lack 
of support from peers, parents, and teachers.168 Kids who 
have been the victims of crime themselves and who hang 
with peers who carry weapons are most likely to bring guns 
to school.169 Troubled kids with little social support and 
carrying deadly weapons make for an explosive situation.
Research shows that most shooting incidents occur 
around the start of the school day, the lunch period, or the 
end of the school day.170 In most of the shootings (55 per-
cent), a note, threat, or other action indicating risk for 
more likely to feel loss of control and exert their power with 
violence.157
Research indicates that most females who kill their mates 
do so after suffering repeated violent attacks.158 Perhaps the 
number of males killed by their partners has declined be-
cause alternatives to abusive relationships, such as battered 
women’s shelters, are becoming more prevalent around the 
United States. Regions that provide greater social support for 
battered women and that have passed legislation to protect 
abuse victims also have lower rates of female-perpetrated 
homicide.159
Some people kill their mates because they fi nd them-
selves involved in a love triangle.160 Interestingly, women 
who kill out of jealousy aim their aggression at their part-
ners; in contrast, men are more likely to kill their mates’ 
suitors. Love triangles tend to become lethal when the of-
fenders believe they have been lied to or betrayed. Lethal 
violence is more common when (a) the rival initiated the 
affair, (b) the killer knew the spouse was already in a steady 
relationship outside the marriage, and (c) the killer was re-
peatedly lied to or betrayed.161
It is possible that men who perceive loss of face aim their 
aggression at rivals who are competing with them for a 
suitable partner. Biosocial theory (Chapter 5) suggests 
that this behavior is motivated by the male’s instinctual 
need to replenish the species and protect his place in the 
gene pool. Killing a rival would help a spouse maintain 
control over a potential mother for his children.
CONNECTIONS
Personal Relations Most murders occur among people 
who are acquainted. Although on the surface the kill-
ing might have seemed senseless, it often is the result of 
a long-simmering dispute motivated by revenge, dispute 
resolution, jealousy, drug deals, racial bias, or threats to 
identity or status.162 For example, a prior act of violence, 
motivated by profi t or greed, may generate revenge kill-
ing, such as when a buyer robs his dealer during a drug 
transaction.
How do these murderous relations develop between 
two people who may have had little prior conflict? In a 
classic study, David Luckenbill studied murder transac-
tions to determine whether particular patterns of behav-
ior are common between the killer and the victim.163 He 
found that many homicides follow a sequential pattern. 
First, the victim makes what the offender considers an of-
fensive move. The offender typically retaliates verbally or 
physically. An agreement to end things violently is forged 
with the victim’s provocative response. The battle ensues, 
leaving the victim dead or dying. The offender’s escape is 
shaped by his or her relationship to the victim or the reac-
tion of the audience, if any.

350  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
On November 30, 1993, the Brady 
Handgun Violence Prevention Act was 
enacted, amending the Gun Control Act 
of 1968. The bill was named after former 
Press Secretary James Brady, who was 
severely wounded in the attempted as-
sassination of President Ronald Reagan 
by John Hinckley in 1981. The Brady Law 
imposes a waiting period of five days be-
fore a licensed importer, manufacturer, 
or dealer may sell, deliver, or transfer a 
handgun to an unlicensed individual. The 
waiting period applies only in states with-
out an acceptable alternate system of 
conducting background checks on hand-
gun purchasers. Beginning November 30, 
1998, the Brady Law changed, providing 
an instant check on whether a prospec-
tive buyer is prohibited from purchasing a 
weapon. Federal law bans gun purchases 
by people convicted of or under indictment 
for felony charges, fugitives, the mentally 
ill, those with dishonorable military dis-
charges, those who have renounced U.S. 
citizenship, illegal aliens, illegal drug users, 
and those convicted of domestic violence 
misdemeanors or who are under domes-
tic violence restraining orders (individual 
state laws may create other restrictions). 
The Brady Law now requires background 
approval not just for handgun buyers but 
also for those who buy long guns and shot-
guns. In addition, the Federal Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 
banned a group of military-style semiauto-
matic firearms (that is, assault weapons). 
However, this ban on assault weapons was 
allowed to lapse in 2004.
Although gun control advocates see 
this legislation as a good first step, some 
question whether such measures will ul-
timately curb gun violence. When Jens 
Ludwig and Philip Cook compared two sets 
of states—32 that installed the Brady Law 
in 1994 and 18 states plus the District of 
Columbia that already had similar types of 
laws prior to 1994—they found there was 
no evidence that implementing the Brady 
Law contributed to a reduction in homicide. 
However, there is evidence that legislation 
targeting specific crimes can bring positive 
results. A number of states have instituted 
laws restricting access to firearms by indi-
viduals who are subject to a restraining or-
der or have been convicted of a domestic 
violence misdemeanor or allow law enforce-
ment officers to confiscate firearms at a do-
mestic violence scene. Research indicates 
that taking guns out of the hands of domes-
tic abusers can lower rates of intimate part-
ner homicides.
Another approach is to severely pun-
ish people caught with unregistered hand-
guns. The most famous attempt to regulate 
handguns using this method is the Mas-
sachusetts Bartley-Fox Law, which pro-
vides a mandatory one-year prison term for 
possessing a handgun (outside the home) 
without a permit. A detailed analysis of vio-
lent crime in Boston after the law’s passage 
found that the use of handguns in robber-
ies and murders did decline substantially 
(in robberies by 35 percent and in murders 
by 55 percent in a two-year period). How-
ever, these optimistic results must be tem-
pered by two facts: rates for similar crimes 
dropped significantly in comparable cities 
that did not have gun control laws, and the 
use of other weapons, such as knives, in-
creased in Boston.
Even if severely restricted, the govern-
ment’s ability to control guns is problematic. 
If legitimate gun stores were strictly regu-
lated, private citizens could still sell, barter, 
or trade handguns. Unregulated gun fairs 
and auctions are common throughout the 
The association between guns and crime 
has spurred many Americans to advocate 
controlling the sale of handguns and ban-
ning the cheap mass-produced hand-
guns known as Saturday night specials. 
In contrast, gun advocates view control as 
a threat to personal liberty and call for se-
vere punishment of criminals rather than 
control of handguns. They argue that the 
Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitu-
tion protects the right to bear arms, a belief 
supported by two recent Supreme Court de-
cisions, District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) 
and McDonald v. Chicago (2010), which 
prohibited states from banning handguns 
while leaving open regulation. In Heller, the 
Court listed areas that could be restricted, 
such as those “prohibit[ing] . . . the posses-
sion of firearms by felons or mentally ill,” 
as well as “laws forbidding the carrying of 
firearms in sensitive places such as schools 
and government buildings, or laws impos-
ing conditions and qualifications on the 
commercial sale of arms”; these restrictions 
are legally permissible and not directly dealt 
with in this case. Though the absolute right 
to own guns is now uncontested, efforts to 
control them persist. States and many lo-
cal jurisdictions have laws banning or re-
stricting sales or possession of guns; some 
regulate dealers who sell guns. The Federal 
Gun Control Act of 1968, which is still in ef-
fect, requires that all dealers be licensed, 
fill out forms detailing each trade, and avoid 
selling to people prohibited from owning 
guns, such as minors, ex-felons, and drug 
users. Dealers must record the source and 
properties of all guns they sell and carefully 
account for their purchase. Gun buyers 
must provide identification and sign waiv-
ers attesting to their ability to possess guns. 
Unfortunately, the resources available to 
enforce this law are meager.
Should Guns Be Controlled?
violence occurred before the event. Shooters were also likely 
to have expressed some form of suicidal behavior and to 
have been bullied by their peers.171

cusses this issue in some detail.

power so that they may actually be inhib-
ited from attacking. Guns may also enable 
victims to escape serious injury. Victims 
may be inhibited from fighting back without 
losing face; it is socially acceptable to back 
down from a challenge if the opponent is 
armed with a gun. Guns then can de-es-
calate a potentially violent situation. The 
benefits of gun ownership, he concludes, 
outweigh the costs.
Does Defensive Gun Use Really Work?
While this research is persuasive, many 
criminologists are still skeptical about the 
benefits of carrying a handgun. Tomislav 
Kovandzic and his colleagues used data 
for all large (population over 100,000) 
U.S. cities to examine the impact of “right 
to carry” concealed handgun laws on vio-
lent crime rates from the period of 1980 
to 2000 and found that carry laws have 
little effect on local crime rates. And while 
Kleck’s research shows that carrying a gun 
can thwart crimes, other research shows 
that defensive gun use may be more lim-
ited than he believes: people who carry 
guns may be at greater risk of victimization 
than those who do not. Even people with 
a history of violence and mental disease 
are less likely to kill when they use a knife 
or other weapon than when they employ a 
gun. Do guns kill people or do people kill 
people? Research indicates that even the 
most dangerous people are less likely to re-
sort to lethal violence if the gun is taken out 
of their hands.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Considering the Supreme Court’s 
most recent decisions, should all re-
strictions on handgun ownership be 
lifted? Should people qualified to own 
a gun be forced to register with the 
government?
 2. Do you personally believe that carrying 
a gun deters would-be criminals? Does 
the deterrent effect of gun ownership 
make up for the danger of having a gun 
around the house?

United States; many gun deals are made at 
gun shows with few questions asked. Peo-
ple obtain firearms illegally through a mul-
titude of unauthorized sources including 
unlicensed dealers, corrupt licensed deal-
ers, and “straw” purchasers (people who 
buy guns for those who cannot purchase 
them legally).
Regulating dealers is difficult, and 
tighter controls on them would only en-
courage private sales and bartering. Rela-
tively few guns are stolen in burglaries, but 
many are sold to licensed gun dealers who 
circumvent the law by ignoring state regis-
tration requirements or making unrecorded 
or misrecorded sales to individuals and un-
licensed dealers. Even a few corrupt deal-
ers can supply tens of thousands of illegal 
handguns.
Is There a Benefit to Having Guns?
Not all experts are convinced that strict 
gun control is a good thing. Some such 
as Gary Kleck, a leading advocate of gun 
ownership, argues that guns may actu-
ally inhibit violence. He finds that Ameri-
cans use guns for defensive purposes 
more than 2 million times a year. While 
this  figure seems huge, it must be viewed 
in the context of gun ownership: almost 
50 million households own a gun; more 
than 90 million, or 49 percent of the adult 
U.S. population, live in households with 
guns; and about 59 million adults person-
ally own guns. Considering these num-
bers, it is not implausible that 3 percent 
of the people (or 2.5 million people) with 
access to guns could have used one de-
fensively in a given year.
Guns have other uses. In many assaults, 
Kleck reasons, the aggressor does not wish 
to kill but only to scare the victim. Possess-
ing a gun gives aggressors enough killing 
after committing gruesome killings in the 1970s he went 
underground and disappeared from view. After 25 years 
of silence, he renewed his communications with a local 
news station. His last communication contained a com-
puter disk, which was traced to 59-year-old Dennis Rader 
after FBI analysis of deleted data on the disk. Rader later 
confessed to 10 murders in an effort to escape the death 
penalty.
Criminologists consider a serial killer, such as Rader, 
to be a person who kills three or more persons in three 
or more separate events. In between the murders, the se-
rial killer reverts to his normal lifestyle. Rader worked as

homicide” and how murders were “the 
only way I have of reminding myself 
that I’m still alive.”175
While Swango obtained pleasure 
from killing, other health care work-
ers who have committed serial murder 
rationalize their behavior by thinking 
they are helping patients end their suf-
fering when they put them to death. 
Harold Frederick Shipman, Britain’s 
most notorious serial killer, was a gen-
eral practitioner convicted of 15 mur-
ders, most involving elderly patients. 
After he committed suicide in 2004, 
further investigation found that he ac-
tually killed 218 patients and perhaps 
even more.176
Another type, the psychopathic 
killer, is motivated by a character disor-
der that causes an inability to experience 
shame, guilt, sorrow, or other normal 
human emotions; these murderers are 
concerned solely with their own needs 
and passions.
Serial murder experts James Alan 
Fox and Jack Levin have developed 
the following typology of serial killer 
motivations:
Thrill killers
 
■
 strive for either sexual sadism or domi-
nance. This is the most common form of serial 
murderer.
Mission killers
 
■
 want to reform the world or have a vision 
that drives them to kill.
Expedience killers
 
■
 are out for profi t or want to protect 
themselves from a perceived threat.177
Female Serial Killers An estimated 10 to 15 percent of 
serial killers are women. A study by criminologists Belea 
Keeney and Kathleen Heide investigated the characteristics 
of a sample of 14 female serial killers and found some strik-
ing differences between the way male and female killers car-
ried out their crimes.178 Males were much more likely than 
females to use extreme violence and torture. Whereas males 
used a “hands-on” approach, including beating, bludgeon-
ing, and strangling their victims, females were more likely 
to poison or smother their victims. Men tracked or stalked 
their victims, but women were more likely to lure victims 
to their death. There were also gender-based personal-
ity and behavior characteristics. Female killers, somewhat 
older than their male counterparts, abused both alcohol 
and drugs; males were not likely to be substance abusers. 
Women were diagnosed as having histrionic, manic-depres-
sive, borderline, dissociative, and antisocial personality dis-
orders; men were more often diagnosed as having antisocial 
personalities. Aileen Wuornos, executed for killing seven 
a supervisor of the Compliance Department at Park City, 
Kansas, which put him in charge of animal control, housing 
problems, zoning, general permit enforcement, and a vari-
ety of nuisance cases. A married father of two, he served as 
a county commissioner, a Cub Scout leader, and a member 
of Christ Lutheran Church where he had been elected pres-
ident of the Congregation Council. Rader’s biography and 
personal life give few clues to his murderous path, which is 
perhaps why it took more than three decades to track him 
down.172
Types of Serial Killers There are different types of se-
rial killers. Some wander the countryside killing at random; 
others hide themselves in a single locale and lure victims 
to their death.173 Theodore Bundy, convicted killer of three 
young women and suspected killer of many others, roamed 
the country in the 1970s, killing as he went. Wayne Gacy, 
during the same period, killed more than 30 boys and 
young men without leaving Chicago.
Some serial killers are sadists who gain satisfaction 
from torturing and killing.174 Sadists wish to gain com-
plete control over their victims through humiliation, 
shame, enslavement, and terror. Dr. Michael Swango, 
who is suspected of killing between 35 and 60 patients, 
wrote in his diary of the pleasure he obtained from mur-
der. He wrote of the “sweet, husky, close smell of indoor 
Serial killers keep their identity secret while they engage in their murderous activities. Some 
may hold trusted positions that shield them from suspicion. Here, former nurse Charles Cullen 
is led by Pennsylvania state troopers to Lehigh County Court in Allentown, Pennsylvania, 
November 17, 2004. Cullen pleaded guilty to six murders and three attempted murders. He 
claimed to have murdered as many as 40 patients during the 16 years he worked at 10 
hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

characteristics on violent crimes around the country.185 This 
program links crimes to determine if they are the product of 
a single culprit.
Mass Murders
In contrast to serial killings, mass murder involves the kill-
ing of four or more victims by one or a few assailants within 
a single event.186 The murderous incident can last but a few 
minutes or as long as several hours. In order to qualify as a 
mass murder, the incident must be carried out by one or a 
few offenders. Highly organized or institutionalized killings 
(i.e., war crimes and large-scale acts of political terrorism, as 
well as certain acts of highly organized crime rings), while 
atrocious, are not considered mass murder and are moti-
vated by a totally different set of factors. The 2004 brutal 
and senseless Xbox murders, which involved the killing of 
six people in Florida by a gang of four men out to avenge 
the theft of clothes and video games, is a mass murder (see 
Chapter 9); the genocide of Hitler’s Third Reich or a terrorist 
attack is not.
Mass murderers engage in a single, uncontrollable out-
burst called “simultaneous killing.” Charles Whitman killed 
14 people and wounded 30 others from atop the 307-foot 
tower on the University of Texas campus on August 1, 1966; 
James Huberty killed 21 people in a McDonald’s restaurant 
in San Ysidro, California, on July 18, 1984; George Hen-
nard, on October 16, 1991, killed 22 people in a Killeen, 
Texas, cafeteria before committing suicide as police closed 
in; and Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and wounded 25 at 
Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007.
Fox and Levin defi ne four types of mass murderers:
Revenge killers
 
■
 seek to get even with individuals or 
society at large. Their typical target is an estranged 
wife and “her” children or an employer and “his” 
employees.
Love killers
 
■
 are motivated by a warped sense of devo-
tion. They are often despondent people who commit 
suicide and take others, such as a wife and children, 
with them.
Profi t killers
 
■
 are usually trying to cover up a crime, elim-
inate witnesses, and carry out a criminal conspiracy.
Terrorist killers
 
■
 are trying to send a message. Gang kill-
ings tell rivals to watch out; cult killers may actually 
leave a message behind to warn society about impend-
ing doom.187
While it often appears that our society has spawned the 
mass murder, a recent study by Grant Duwe shows that 
more than 900 mass killings took place between 1900 and 
1999 and that mass killings were nearly as common dur-
ing the 1920s and 1930s as they are today. More of the ear-
lier incidents involved familicide (i.e., killing of one’s family) 
and killers were more likely to be older and more suicidal 
than they are today. The most signifi cant difference between 
men, was diagnosed with a severe psychopathic personality, 
a product most likely of her horrifi c childhood marred by 
beatings, alcoholism, rape, incest, and prostitution.179
The profi le of the female serial killer that emerges is a 
person who smothers or poisons someone she knows. Dur-
ing childhood she suffered from an abusive relationship in 
a disrupted family. Female killers’ education levels are be-
low average, and if they hold jobs, they are in low-status 
positions.
Why Do Serial Killers Kill? The cause of serial murder 
eludes criminologists. Such disparate factors as mental ill-
ness, sexual frustration, neurological damage, child abuse 
and neglect, smothering relationships with mothers (David 
Berkowitz, the notorious Son of Sam, slept in his parents’ 
bed until he was 10), and childhood anxiety are suspected. 
Most experts view serial killers as sociopaths who from early 
childhood demonstrate bizarre behavior, such as tortur-
ing animals. Some are sadists who enjoy the sexual thrill of 
murdering and who are both pathological and destructive 
narcissists.180
This behavior extends to the pleasure they reap from 
killing, their ability to ignore or enjoy their victims’ suffer-
ing, and their propensity for basking in the media limelight 
when apprehended for their crimes. Killing provides a way 
to fi ll their emotional hunger and reduce their anxiety lev-
els.181 Wayne Henley, Jr., who along with Dean Corill killed 
27 boys in Houston, offered to help prosecutors fi nd the 
bodies of additional victims so he could break Chicago killer 
Wayne Gacy’s record of 33 murders.182
According to experts Fox and Levin, serial killers enjoy 
the thrill, the sexual gratifi cation, and the dominance they 
achieve over the lives of their victims. The serial killer rarely 
uses a gun because this method is too quick and would de-
prive him of his greatest pleasure, exulting in his victim’s 
suffering. Levin and Fox dispute the notion that serial kill-
ers have some form of biological or psychological problems, 
such as genetic anomalies or schizophrenia. Even the most 
sadistic serial murderers are not mentally ill or driven by 
delusions or hallucinations. Instead, they typically exhibit a 
sociopathic personality that deprives them of pangs of con-
science or guilt to guide their behavior. Serial killers are not 
insane, they claim, but “more cruel than crazy.”183
Controlling Serial Killers Serial killers come from di-
verse backgrounds. To date, law enforcement offi cials have 
been at a loss to control random killers who leave few clues, 
constantly move, and have little connection to their victims. 
Catching serial killers is often a matter of luck. To help local 
law enforcement offi cials, the FBI has developed a profi ling 
system to identify potential suspects. Because serial killers 
often use the same patterns in each attack, they leave a sig-
nature that might help in their capture.184
In addition, the Justice Department’s Violent Criminal 
Apprehension Program (VICAP), a computerized infor-
mation service, gathers information and matches offense

offensive touching, such as if a man kisses a woman against 
her will or puts his hands on her body. In some legal juris-
dictions, biting someone when infected with AIDS is con-
sidered an aggravated assault; some AIDs-infected people 
have been convicted of aggravated assault for spitting on 
their victims.194
Nature and Extent of Assault
The pattern of criminal assault is similar to that of homi-
cide; one could say that the only difference between the two 
is that the victim survives.195 Assaults may be common in 
our society simply because of common life stresses. Motor-
ists who assault each other have become such a familiar oc-
currence that the term road rage has been coined. There 
have even been frequent incidents of violent assault among 
frustrated passengers who lose control while traveling.
Every citizen is bound by the law of assault, even police 
offi cers. Excessive use of force can result in criminal charges 
being fi led even if it occurs while police offi cers are arresting 
a dangerous felony suspect. Only the minimum amount of 
force needed to subdue the suspect is allowed by law, and if 
police use more aggressive tactics than required, they may 
fi nd themselves the target of criminal charges and civil law-
suits that can run into the millions of dollars.196
The FBI records about 825,000 assaults each year, a rate 
of about 275 per 100,000 inhabitants. Like other violent 
crimes, the number of assaults has been in decline, down 
about 20 percent in the past decade. People arrested for as-
sault and those identifi ed by victims are usually young, male 
(about 80 percent), and white, although the number of Af-
rican Americans arrested for assault (about one-third of the 
total) is disproportionate to their representation in the pop-
ulation. Assault victims tend to be male, but females also 
face a signifi cant danger. Assault rates are highest in urban 
areas, during summer, and in southern and western regions. 
The most common weapons used in assaults are blunt in-
struments and hands and feet.
The NCVS indicates that only about half of all serious 
assaults are reported to the police. The NCVS indicates that 
the number of assault victimizations has been in steep de-
cline, dropping more than 50 percent during the past de-
cade; even weapon-related assaults have dropped sharply.
Assault in the Home
Violent attacks in the home are one of the most frightening types 
of assault. Criminologists recognize that intrafamily violence is 
an enduring social problem in the United States and abroad.
The UN’s World Health Organization (WHO) found that 
around the world, women often face the greatest risk for vi-
olence in their own homes and in familiar settings. Almost 
half the women who die due to homicide are killed by their 
current or former husbands or boyfriends; in some countries 
contemporary mass murders and those in the past: more 
killers use guns today and more incidents involve drug 
traffi cking.188
Spree Killers In 2009, Michael McLendon, 28, killed 
10 people in rural Alabama before taking his own life. He 
had a target list that detectives found in his home. After 
killing seven members of his family, he drove around the 
county and killed three more people at random.189 Spree 
killers like McLendon engage in a rampage of violence tak-
ing place over a period of days or weeks. Unlike mass mur-
derers, their killing is not confi ned to a single outburst, and 
unlike serial killers, they don’t have a “cooling off” period 
between murders or return to their “normal” identities in 
between killings.
The most notorious spree killing to date occurred in 
October 2002, in the Washington, D.C., area.190 John Lee 
Malvo, 17, a Jamaican citizen, and his traveling companion 
John Allen Muhammad, 41, an Army veteran with an ex-
pert’s rating in marksmanship, went on a rampage that left 
more than 10 people dead.
Some spree killers target a specifi c group or class. John 
Paul Franklin targeted mixed race couples, African Americans, 
and Jews, committing more than 20 murders in 12 states in 
an effort to instigate a race war (Franklin also shot and para-
lyzed Hustler publisher Larry Flynt because he published pic-
tures of interracial sex).191 Others, like the D.C. snipers Malvo 
and Muhammed, kill randomly and do not seek out a specifi c 
class of victim; their targets included young and old, African 
Americans and whites, men and women.192
ASSAULT AND BATTERY
Although many people mistakenly believe the term as-
sault and battery refers to a single act, they are actually two 
separate crimes. Battery requires offensive touching, such 
as slapping, hitting, or punching a victim. Assault requires 
no actual touching but involves either attempted battery or 
intentionally frightening the victim by word or deed. Al-
though common law originally intended these twin crimes 
to be misdemeanors, most jurisdictions now upgrade them 
to felonies either when a weapon is used or when they oc-
cur during the commission of a felony (for example, when 
a person is assaulted during a robbery). In the UCR, the FBI 
defi nes serious assault, or aggravated assault, as “an unlaw-
ful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of 
infl icting severe or aggravated bodily injury”; this defi nition 
is similar to the one used in most state jurisdictions.193
Under common law, battery required bodily injury, 
such as broken limbs or wounds. However, under modern 
law, battery occurs if the victim suffers a temporarily pain-
ful blow, even if no injury results. Battery can also involve

CHAPTER 10 | Interpersonal Violence  355
Causes of Child Abuse As Figure 10.4 shows, the great 
majority of child abuse cases involve parents. Why do par-
ents physically assault their children? Such maltreatment is 
a highly complex problem with neither a single cause nor 
a readily available solution. It cuts across ethnic, religious, 
and socioeconomic lines. Abusive parents cannot be catego-
rized by sex, age, or educational level; they come from all 
walks of life.203
A number of factors have been commonly linked to 
abuse and neglect:
Family violence seems to be perpetuated from one gen-
 
■
eration to another within families. The behavior of abu-
sive parents can often be traced to negative experiences in 
their own childhood—physical abuse, lack of love, emo-
tional neglect, incest, and so on.
Blended families, which include children living with 
 
■
an unrelated adult such as a stepparent or another 
unrelated co-resident, have also been linked to abuse. 
Children who live with a mother’s boyfriend are at much 
greater risk for abuse than children living with two ge-
netic parents. Some stepparents do not have strong emo-
tional ties to their nongenetic children, nor do they reap 
emotional benefi ts from the parent–child relationship.204
Parents may also become abusive if they are isolated 
 
■
from friends, neighbors, or relatives who can help in 
times of crisis. Potentially abusive parents are often 
about 70 percent of all female deaths are domes-
tic homicides. It is possible that nearly one in 
four women will experience violence by an inti-
mate partner in their lifetime, and most of these 
are subjected to multiple acts of violence over 
extended periods of time. In addition to physical 
abuse, a third to over half of these cases are ac-
companied by sexual violence; in some countries, 
up to one-third of adolescent girls report forced 
sexual initiation.197 The WHO report found that 
the percentage of women assaulted by a spouse or 
intimate partner varied considerably around the 
world: less than 3 percent in the United States, 
Canada, and Australia and up to 38 percent of 
the married women in the Republic of Korea and 
52 percent of Palestinian women on the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip.198 In many places, assaults 
and even murders occur because men believe 
that their partners have been defi led sexually, ei-
ther through rape or sex outside of marriage. In 
some societies, the only way to cleanse the family 
honor is by killing the offending female. In Al-
exandria, Egypt, for example, 47 percent of the 
women who were killed by a relative were mur-
dered after they had been raped.199
Child Abuse One area of intrafamily violence 
that has received a great deal of media attention is 
child abuse. This term describes any physical or 
emotional trauma to a child for which no reason-
able explanation, such as an accident or ordinary disciplinary 
practices, can be found.200 Child abuse can result from actual 
physical beatings administered to a child by hands, feet, weap-
ons, belts, sticks, burning, and so on. Another form of abuse 
results from neglect—not providing a child with the care and 
shelter to which he or she is entitled.
Yearly national surveys conducted by the Department 
of Health and Human Services show that while child abuse 
rates are in decline the problem is still signifi cant: child pro-
tective services (CPS) agencies throughout the United States 
receive more than 3 million referrals each year involving the 
alleged maltreatment of approximately 6 million children. Of 
these, approximately 63 percent of the referrals were screened 
in for investigation or assessment by CPS agencies. In other 
words, nearly 2 million reports had an investigation or as-
sessment. Of these approximately 24 percent of the investi-
gations or assessments determined at least one child to be a 
victim of abuse or neglect, or more than 500,000 per year.201 
While these numbers seem high, the number of confi rmed 
child abuse/neglect cases has been declining. In 1995, for ex-
ample, more than 1 million cases were confi rmed. Accord-
ing to child maltreatment authority David Finkelor and his 
colleagues, there are a variety of reasons for the decline, but 
the easy availability of psychotropic drugs, which may relieve 
parental anger and stress, might be the greatest contributor to 
the decline in reported child abuse.202

356  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Spousal Abuse Spousal abuse has occurred throughout 
recorded history. Roman men had the legal right to beat their 
wives for minor acts such as attending public games with-
out permission, drinking wine, or walking outdoors with 
their faces uncovered.215 More serious transgressions, such 
as adultery, were punishable by death. During the later stages 
of the Roman Empire, the practice of wife beating abated, 
and by the fourth century, excessive violence on the part of 
husband or wife was grounds for divorce.216 During the early 
Middle Ages, there was a separation of love and marriage.217 
The ideal woman was protected, cherished, and loved from 
afar. In contrast, the wife, with whom marriage had been ar-
ranged by family ties, was guarded jealously and could be 
punished severely for violating her duties. A husband was 
expected to beat his wife for “misbehaviors” and might him-
self be punished by neighbors if he failed to do so.218
Through the later Middle Ages and into modern times 
(from 1400 to 1900), there was little community objection 
to a man using force against his wife as long as the assault 
did not exceed certain limits, usually construed as death or 
disfi gurement. By the mid-nineteenth century, severe wife 
beating fell into disfavor, and accused wife beaters were 
subject to public ridicule. Nonetheless, limited chastise-
ment was still the rule. By the close of the nineteenth cen-
tury, England and the United States outlawed wife beating. 
Yet the long history of husbands’ domination of their wives 
made physical coercion hard to control. Until recent times, 
the subordinate position of women in the family was be-
lieved to give husbands the legal and moral obligation to 
manage their wives’ behavior. Even after World War II, Eng-
lish courts found physical assault a reasonable punishment 
for a wife who had disobeyed her husband.219 These ideas 
form the foundation of men’s traditional physical control of 
women and have led to severe cases of spousal assault.
The Nature and Extent of Spousal Abuse It is diffi cult 
to estimate how widespread spousal abuse is today; however, 
some statistics indicate the extent of the problem. In their clas-
sic study of family violence, Richard Gelles and Murray Straus 
found that 16 percent of surveyed families had experienced 
husband–wife assaults.220 In police departments around the 
country, 60 to 70 percent of evening calls involve domestic 
disputes.
Not only married women are prone to being victimized 
by an intimate partner. Dating violence is quite common, 
and an estimated one in five high school girls may suffer 
sexual or physical abuse from a boyfriend. Dating violence 
has been linked to substance abuse, unsafe sex, and eating 
disorders.221
Women are not the only victims of spousal abuse. One 
recent study of 12,000 male abuse victims serving in the 
U.S. Army found that abused men were at greater risk for 
early army discharge and hospitalization than were nonvic-
tims—particularly hospitalizations for depression, alcohol 
dependence, and mental health problems.222
Some of the personal attributes and characteristics of spouse 
abusers and abusive situations are listed in Exhibit 10.4.
alienated from society; they have carried the concept of 
the shrinking nuclear family to its most extreme form 
and are cut off from ties of kinship and contact with 
other people in the neighborhood.205
Sexual Abuse Another aspect of the abuse syndrome is 
sexual abuse—the exploitation of children through rape, 
incest, and molestation by parents or other adults. It is dif-
fi cult to estimate the incidence of sexual abuse, but a num-
ber of attempts have been made to gauge the extent of the 
problem. In a classic study, Diana Russell’s survey of women 
in the San Francisco area found that 38 percent had ex-
perienced intra- or extrafamilial sexual abuse by the time 
they reached age 18.206 Others have estimated that at least 
20 percent of females suffer some form of sexual violence; 
that is, at least one in fi ve girls suffer sexual abuse.207
Although sexual abuse is still prevalent, the number of 
reported cases has been in a signifi cant decline.208 However, 
this trend must be interpreted with caution. While it is pos-
sible that the actual number of cases is truly in decline be-
cause of the effectiveness of prevention programs, increased 
prosecution, and public awareness campaigns, declines 
might be the result of more cases being overlooked because 
of (a) increased evidentiary requirements to substantiate 
cases, (b) increased caseworker caution due to new legal 
rights for caregivers, and (c) increasing limitations on the 
types of cases that agencies accept for investigation.209
Sexual abuse is of particular concern because children 
who have been abused experience a long list of symptoms, 
including fear, posttraumatic stress disorder, behavior prob-
lems, sexualized behavior, and poor self-esteem.210 Women 
who were abused as children are also at greater risk to be 
reabused as adults than those who avoided childhood vic-
timization.211 The amount of force used during the abuse, its 
duration, and its frequency are all related to the extent of the 
long-term effects and the length of time needed for recovery.
Regardless of its cause, child abuse can have devastating 
long-term effects, ranging from depression to loss of self-
 esteem.212 Not surprisingly, a history of childhood sexual 
and physical abuse among persons with severe mental ill-
ness is disproportionately high.213
Parental Abuse Parents are sometimes the target of abuse 
from their own children. Research conducted by Arina 
 Ulman and Murray Straus found:
The younger the child, the higher the rate of child-to-
 
■
parent violence (CPV).
At all ages, more children were violent to mothers than 
 
■
to fathers.
Both boys and girls hit mothers more often than fathers.
 
■
At all ages, slightly more boys than girls hit parents.
 
■
Ulman and Straus found that child-to-parent violence was 
associated with some form of violence by parents, which could 
either be husband-to-wife, wife-to-husband, corporal punish-
ment of children, or physical abuse. They suggest that if the 
use of physical punishment could be eliminated or curtailed, 
then child-to-parent violence would similarly decline.214

CHAPTER 10 | Interpersonal Violence  357
This May 18, 2010, security photo shows Michael Mara, a man the 
FBI nicknamed the “Granddad Bandit,” holding a black wallet 
containing a holdup note. Mara robbed 25 banks in 13 eastern and 
central states, beginning his crime spree with a robbery in Mobile, 
Alabama, on January 16, 2009. FBI officials believe he struck three 
times in Atlanta, Georgia, and twice in Mobile, Alabama. He robbed 
four banks overall in Alabama, four in Georgia, three in Texas, two in 
Arkansas, and one each in the other states. Michael Mara’s crime 
spree came to an end with an arrest on August 11, 2010.

ROBBERY
The common-law defi nition of robbery (and the one used 
by the FBI) is “the taking or attempting to take anything 
of value from the care, custody or control of a person or 
persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by put-
ting the victim in fear.”223 A robbery is considered a violent 
crime because it involves the use of force to obtain money 
or goods. Robbery is punished severely because the victim’s 
life is put in jeopardy. In fact, the severity of punishment is 
based on the amount of force used during the crime, not the 
value of the items taken.
The FBI records about 400,000 robberies each year, a 
rate of about 140 per 100,000 population. As with most 
other violent crimes, there has been a signifi cant reduction 
in the robbery rate during the past decade; the robbery rate 
is down almost 40 percent.
Attempts have been made to classify and explain the 
nature and dynamics of robbery. One approach is to char-
acterize robberies by type (Exhibit 10.5), and another is 
to characterize types of robbers based on their specialties 
(Exhibit 10.6).
As these typologies indicate, the typical armed robber 
is unlikely to be a professional who carefully studies targets 
while planning a crime. People walking along the street, 
convenience stores, and gas stations are much more likely 
robbery targets than banks or other highly secure environ-
ments. Robbers, therefore, seem to be diverted by modest 
EXHIBIT 10.4
Factors that Predict Spousal Abuse
Presence of alcohol.
 
■
 Excessive alcohol use may turn 
otherwise docile husbands into wife abusers.
Access to weapons.
 
■
 A perpetrator’s access to a gun and 
previous threat with a weapon may lead to abuse.
Stepchild in the home. 
 
■
Having a stepchild living in the 
home may provoke abuse because the parent may have a 
more limited bond to the child.
Estrangement.
 
■
 This may occur especially in the case of 
a controlling partner and subsequent involvement with 
another partner.
Hostility toward dependency.
 
■
 Some husbands who appear 
docile and passive may resent their dependence on their 
wives and react with rage and violence; this reaction has 
been linked to sexual inadequacy.
Excessive brooding.
 
■
 Obsession with a wife’s behavior, 
however trivial, can result in violent assaults.
Social learning.
 
■
 Some males believe society approves of 
spouse or mate abuse and use these beliefs to justify their 
violent behavior. Peer support helps shape their attitudes 
and behaviors.
Socioeconomic factors.
 
■
 Men who fail as providers and are 
under economic stress may take their frustrations out on 
their wives.
Flashes of anger.
 
■
 Research shows that a significant amount 
of family violence results from a sudden burst of anger 
after a verbal dispute.
Military service.
 
■
 Spousal abuse among men who have served 
in the military service is extremely high. Similarly, those 
serving in the military are more likely to assault their wives 
than civilian husbands. The reasons for this phenomenon 
may be the violence promoted by military training and the 
close proximity in which military families live to one another.
Having been battered children.
 
■
 Husbands who assault 
their wives were generally battered as children.
Unpredictability.
 
■
 Batterers are unpredictable, unable to be 
influenced by their wives, and impossible to prevent from 
battering once an argument has begun.

defensive measures, such as having more than one clerk in a 
store or locating stores in strip malls; they are more likely to 
try an isolated store.224
Acquaintance Robbery
As Exhibit 10.6 suggests, one type of robber may focus on 
people they know, a phenomenon referred to as acquain-
tance robbery. This seems puzzling because victims can 
easily identify their attackers and report them to the police. 
However, despite this threat, acquaintance robbery may be 
attractive for a number of rational reasons:225
Victims may be reluctant to report these crimes because 
 
■
they do not want to get involved with the police. They 
may be involved in crime themselves (drug dealers, for 
EXHIBIT 10.6 
Types of Robbers
Professional robbers.
 
■
 These robbers have a long-term 
commitment to crime as a source of livelihood. This type of 
robber plans and organizes crimes prior to committing them 
and seeks money to support a hedonistic lifestyle. Some 
professionals are exclusively robbers, whereas others engage 
in additional types of crimes. Professionals are committed 
to robbing because it is direct, fast, and profitable. They 
hold no other steady job and plan three or four “big scores” 
a year to support themselves. Planning and skill are the 
trademarks of the professional robber, who usually operates 
in groups with assigned roles. Professionals usually steal 
large amounts from commercial establishments. After a 
score, they may stop for a few weeks until “things cool off.”
Opportunist robbers.
 
■
 These robbers steal to obtain small 
amounts of money when an accessible target presents itself. 
They are not committed to robbery but will steal from cab 
drivers, drunks, the elderly, and other vulnerable persons 
if they need some extra spending money. Opportunists are 
usually teens and gang members who do not plan their 
crimes. Although they operate within the milieu of the juvenile 
gang, they are seldom organized and spend little time 
discussing weapon use, getaway plans, or other strategies.
Addict robbers. 
 
■
These people steal to support their drug 
habits. They have a low commitment to robbery because 
of its danger but a high commitment to theft because it 
supplies needed funds. The addict is less likely to plan 
crime or use weapons than the professional robber but is 
more cautious than the opportunist. Addicts choose targets 
that present minimal risk; however, when desperate for 
funds, they are sometimes careless in selecting the victim 
and executing the crime. They rarely think in terms of the 
big score; they just want enough money to get their next fix.
Alcoholic robbers. 
 
■
These people steal for reasons related to 
their excessive consumption of alcohol. Alcoholic robbers 
steal (a) when, in a disoriented state, they attempt to get 
some money to buy liquor or (b) when their condition 
makes them unemployable and they need funds. Alcoholic 
robbers have no real commitment to robbery as a way of 
life. They plan their crimes randomly and give little thought 
to their victim, circumstance, or escape. For that reason, 
they are the most likely to be caught.

EXHIBIT 10.5 
Types of Robberies
Robbery in an open area. 
 
■
These robberies include street 
muggings, purse snatchings, and other attacks. Street 
robberies are the most common type, especially in urban 
areas, where this type of robbery constitutes about 60 
percent of reported totals. Street robbery is most closely 
associated with mugging or yoking, which refers to 
grabbing victims from behind and threatening them with a 
weapon. Street muggers often target unsavory characters 
such as drug dealers or pimps who carry large amounts 
of cash, because these victims would find it awkward to 
report the crime to the police. Most commit their robberies 
within a short distance from their homes.
Commercial robbery.
 
■
 This type of robbery occurs in 
businesses ranging from banks to liquor stores. Banks are 
among the most difficult targets to rob, because they have 
more personnel and a higher level of security.
Robbery on private premises. 
 
■
This type of robbery involves 
breaking into people’s homes. FBI records indicate that this 
type of robbery accounts for about 10 percent of all offenses.
Robbery after a short, preliminary association.
 
■
 This type 
of robbery comes after a chance meeting—in a bar, at a 
party, or after a sexual encounter.
Robbery after a longer association between victim and 
 
■
offender. An example of this type of robbery would be an 
intimate acquaintance robbing his paramour and then 
fleeing the jurisdiction.
Carjacking.
 
■
 This is a completed or attempted theft of a 
motor vehicle by force or threat of force.

CHAPTER 10 | Interpersonal Violence  359
the dispute by stealing the victim’s property. In this in-
stance, robbery may be considered a substitute for an 
assault: the robber wants retribution and revenge rather 
than remuneration.226
Because the robber knows the victim personally, the 
 
■
robber has inside information that there will be a “good 
take.” Offenders may target people they know to be 
carrying a large amount of cash or who just purchased 
expensive jewelry.
When a person in desperate need for immediate cash runs 
 
■
out of money, the individual may target people in close 
proximity simply because they are convenient targets.
When Richard Felson and his associates studied acquain-
tance robbery, they found that victims were more likely to 
be injured in acquaintance robberies than in stranger rob-
beries, indicating that revenge rather than reward was the 
primary motive.227 Similarly, robberies of family members 
were more likely to have a bigger payoff than stranger rob-
beries, an indication that the offender was aware that the 
target had a large amount of cash on hand.
EMERGING FORMS OF 
INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
Assault, rape, robbery, and murder are traditional forms 
of interpersonal violence. As more data become available, 
criminologists have recognized relatively new subcategories 
within these crime types, such as serial murder and date 
rape. Additional new categories of interpersonal violence 
are now receiving attention in criminological literature; the 
next sections describe three of these forms of violent crime.
Hate Crimes
Hate crimes usually involve convenient, vulnerable tar-
gets who are incapable of fi ghting back. For example, there 
have been numerous reported incidents of teenagers attack-
ing vagrants and the homeless in an effort to rid their town 
or neighborhood of people they consider undesirable.228 
Another group targeted for hate crimes is gay men and 
women: gay bashing has become common in U.S. cities. 
The Profi les in Crime discusses a highly publicized New 
York hate crime.
Racial and ethnic minorities have also been the targets of 
attack. In California, Mexican laborers have been attacked and 
killed; in New Jersey, Indian immigrants have been the targets 
of racial hatred.229 Although hate crimes are often mindless 
attacks directed toward “traditional” minority victims, politi-
cal and economic trends may cause this form of violence to be 
redirected. For example, Asians have been attacked by groups 
who resent the growing economic power of Japan and Korea 
as well as the commercial success of Asian Americans.230 The 
factors that precipitate hate crimes are listed in Exhibit 10.7.
The Roots of Hate Why do people commit bias crimes? In 
their book Hate Crimes, Jack McDevitt and Jack Levin identify 
three motivations for hate crimes: thrill-seeking hate crimes, 
reactive (defensive) hate crimes, and mission hate crimes:
Thrill-seeking hate crimes.
 
■
 In the same way some kids 
like to get together to shoot hoops, hatemongers join 
forces to have fun by bashing minorities or destroying 
property. Infl icting pain on others gives them a sadistic 
thrill.
Reactive (defensive) hate crimes.
 
■
 Perpetrators of these 
crimes rationalize their behavior as a defensive stand 
taken against outsiders whom they believe threaten their 
community or way of life. A gang of teens that attacks 
a new family in the neighborhood because they are the 
“wrong” race is committing a reactive hate crime.
Mission hate crimes.
 
■
 Some disturbed individuals see it 
as their duty to rid the world of evil. Those on a “mis-
sion,” like skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), and 
white supremacist groups, may seek to eliminate people 
who threaten their religious beliefs because they are 
members of a different faith or threaten “racial purity” 
because they are of a different race.231
More recent research by McDevitt and Levin with Su-
san Bennett used data from the Community Disorders Unit 
(CDU) of the Boston Police Department to uncover a new 
category of hate crime: retaliatory hate crimes. These of-
fenses are committed in response to a hate crime, whether 
real or perceived; whether the original incident actually oc-
curred is irrelevant. Their more recent research indicates 
that most hate crimes can be classifi ed as thrill motivated 
(66 percent) followed by defensive (25 percent) and re-
taliatory (8 percent). Few cases were mission-oriented 
offenders.232
In his book The Violence of Hate, Levin notes that in 
addition to the traditional hatemongers, hate crimes can 
be committed by “dabblers”—people who are not com-
mitted to hate but drift in and out of active bigotry. They 
may be young people who get drunk on Saturday night 
and assault a gay couple or attack an African American 
man who happens by; they then go back to work or school 
on Monday. Some are thrill seekers, while others may be 
reacting to the presence of members of a disliked group 
in their neighborhood. Levin also notes that some people 
are “sympathizers”: they may not attack African Americans 
but think nothing of telling jokes with racial themes or 
agreeing with people who despise gays. Finally, there are 
“spectators” who may not actively participate in bigotry 
but who do nothing to stop its course. They may even vote 
for politicians who are openly bigoted because they agree 
with their tax policies or some other positions, neglecting 
to process the fact that their vote empowers prejudice and 
leads to hate.233

360  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Nature and Extent of Hate Crime According to the 
FBI, about 8,000 hate crime incidents occur each year.234
 Almost half are motivated by racial bigotry, 20 percent by 
religious intolerance, another 17 percent were the result of 
a sexual-orientation bias, and about 11 percent are triggered 
by an ethnicity/national origin bias; the remainder involved 
a bias against a disability.235 A recent analysis of 3,000 hate 
crime cases reported to the police found that about 60 per-
cent of hate crimes involved a violent act, most commonly 
intimidation or simple assault, and 40 percent of the inci-
dents involved property crimes, most commonly damage, 
destruction, or vandalism of property.236 While intimidation 
was the most common form of hate crime, about 20 percent 
involve assault with a weapon and a few lead to death.
In crimes where victims could actually identify the cul-
prits, most victims reported that they were acquainted with 
their attackers or that their attackers were actually friends, 
coworkers, neighbors, or relatives.237 Younger victims were 
Though Conroy admitted to stabbing 
Lucero when he was interrogated by police, 
at trial he changed his story and claimed 
that another boy was responsible. Why did 
he make a false confession? To protect a 
friend, Christopher Overton, 17, who was 
already on probation and facing a long 
prison sentence as a second offender. The 
jury did not buy Conroy’s explanation and 
found him guilty of manslaughter. Though 
the jury found that Conroy did not intend 
to kill Lucero (which would have been sec-
ond-degree murder), they concluded his 
reckless actions did cause death; the judge 
sentenced him to 25 years in prison, the 
maximum under law. 
The Lucero case became a focal point 
for the tensions that had developed between 
the Hispanic community and local Anglo 
residents on Eastern Long Island. Soon 
after the stabbing, a number of Hispanic 
residents came forward saying they were 
the victims of harassment and assaults. 
The Suffolk County Police Department was 
criticized for failing to fully investigate com-
plaints of assaults on Latinos.
What would motivate a young man 
such as Jeffrey Conroy to kill a complete 
stranger for no apparent reason? His par-
ents and friends saw him as a friendly, 
athletic teenager in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. He was no hater, they claimed, 
having several Hispanics among his clos-
est friends, including the girl he had been 
dating off and on for years. In contrast, the 
prosecutors portrayed him as an aggres-
sive teenager with a swastika tattoo on his 
thigh who stabbed an innocent immigrant 
out of hate and anger, and then lied in 
court when he blamed someone else for 
the crime.

Bound by Hate
On November 8, 2008, 17-year-old Jef-
frey Conroy and six other Long Island, New 
York, teenagers decided to hunt for His-
panic men to assault, an activity they called 
“Mexican hopping.” Around midnight in 
the parking lot of the Patchogue, Long Is-
land, train station, the boys encountered 
37-year-old Marcelo Lucero, a local man 
who worked in a neighborhood dry clean-
ing shop. Lucero and another man were 
walking to a friend’s house when they were 
surrounded, taunted, and attacked with a 
knife. One of Lucero’s arteries was severed 
and he bled to death. The gang members 
were soon identified and arrests made.

simply a robbery gone bad: “It was not because me and 
Aaron had anything against gays.”241
However, in his important book Punishing Hate: Bias 
Crimes under American Law, Frederick Lawrence argues 
that criminals motivated by bias deserve to be punished 
more severely than those who commit identical crimes for 
other motives.242 He suggests that a society dedicated to the 
equality of all its people must treat bias crimes differently 
from other crimes and in so doing enhance the punishment 
of these crimes.243
Some criminals choose their victims randomly; oth-
ers select specifi c victims, for example, as in crimes of re-
venge. Bias crimes are different. They are crimes in which 
(a) distinct identifying characteristics of the victim are criti-
cal to the perpetrator’s choice of victim, and (b) the indi-
vidual identity of the victim is irrelevant.244 Lawrence views 
a bias crime as one that would not have been committed 
but for the victim’s membership in a particular group.245
Bias crimes should be punished more severely because the 
harm caused will exceed that caused by crimes with other 
motivations:246
Bias crimes are more likely to be violent and involve 
 
■
serious physical injury to the victim.
Bias crimes will have signifi cant emotional and psycho-
 
■
logical impact on the victim; they result in a “height-
ened sense of vulnerability,” which causes depression, 
anxiety, and feelings of helplessness.
Bias crimes harm not only the victim but also the “tar-
 
■
get community.”
Bias crimes violate the shared value of equality among 
 
■
citizens and racial and religious harmony in a heteroge-
neous society.
Recent research by McDevitt and his associates that 
made use of bias crime records collected by the Boston po-
lice supports Lawrence’s position. McDevitt found that the 
victims of bias crime experience more severe post-crime 
psychological trauma, for a longer period of time, than do 
victims of similar crimes that are not motivated by hate or 
bias. Hate crime victims are more likely to suffer intrusive 
thoughts, feelings of danger, nervousness, and depression 
at a higher level than other crime victims.247 Considering 
the damage caused by bias crimes, it seems appropriate 
that they be punished more severely than typical common-
law crimes.
Legal Controls Should symbolic acts of hate such as 
drawing a swastika or burning a cross be banned or are 
they protected by the free speech clause of the First Amend-
ment? The U.S. Supreme Court helped answer this ques-
tion in the case of Virginia v. Black (2003) when it upheld a 
Virginia statute that makes it a felony “for any person . . . 
with the intent of intimidating any person or group . . . to 
burn . . . a cross on the property of another, a highway or 
other public place,” and specifi es that “[a]ny such burning 
more likely to be victimized by people known to them. Hate 
crimes can occur in many settings, but most are perpetrated 
in public settings.
While 8,000 hate-related incidents each year may seem 
like a lot, many hate crimes go unreported, so that fi gure 
may represent only the tip of the iceberg. Defining hate 
crimes may differ between legal jurisdictions and so may 
the incentive to enforce hate crime laws. In a recent study, 
Ryan King and his associates investigated the association be-
tween past lynchings (1882 to 1930) and contemporary law 
enforcement responses to hate crimes in the United States. 
They found that contemporary hate crime policing and 
prosecution is less vigorous where lynching was more prev-
alent prior to 1930, especially in areas that now have large 
African American populations. That is, past lynching com-
bined with a sizeable black population largely suppresses 
(a) police compliance with federal hate crime law, (b) police 
reports of hate crimes that target blacks, and (c) the like-
lihood of prosecuting a hate crime case. Their conclusion: 
social control of intergroup confl ict (i.e., hate-related crime) 
is in part a function of both current racial threat and a long-
held cultural tradition of apathy toward the protection of 
minorities.238
Controlling Hate Crimes Because of the extent and seri-
ousness of the problem, a number of legal jurisdictions have 
made a special effort to control the spread of hate crimes. 
Boston maintains the Community Disorders Unit, and the 
New York City Police Department formed the Bias Incident 
Investigating Unit in 1980. When a crime anywhere in the 
city is suspected of being motivated by bias, the unit initi-
ates an investigation. The unit also assists victims and works 
with concerned organizations such as the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Gay and Lesbian Task Force. These 
agencies deal with noncriminal bias incidents through me-
diation, education, and other forms of prevention.239
There are also specifi c hate crime laws that originated af-
ter the Civil War and that were designed to protect the rights 
of freed slaves.240 Today, almost every state jurisdiction has 
enacted some form of legislation designed to combat hate 
crimes: 39 states have enacted laws against bias-motivated 
violence and intimidation; 19 states have statutes that spe-
cifi cally mandate the collection of hate crime data.
Some critics argue that it is unfair to punish criminals 
motivated by hate any more severely than those who com-
mit similar crimes whose motivation is revenge, greed, or 
anger. There is also the danger that what appears to be a 
hate crime, because the target is a minority group mem-
ber, may actually be motivated by some other factor such 
as vengeance or monetary gain. In November 2004, Aaron 
McKinney (who is serving a life sentence for killing Mat-
thew Shepard) told ABC News correspondent Elizabeth Var-
gas that he was high on methamphetamine when he killed 
Shepard, and that his intent was robbery and not hate. His 
partner, Russell Henderson, claimed that the killing was

362  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Not all workplace violence is triggered by manage-
ment-induced injustice. In some incidents coworkers have 
been killed because they refused romantic relationships 
with the assailants or reported them for sexual harassment. 
 Others have been killed because they got a job the assail-
ant coveted.
Irate clients and customers have also killed because of 
poor service or perceived slights. While hospital employ-
ees are taught to handle agitated patients, sometimes peo-
ple whose demands have not been met may turn on these 
caregivers: health care and social services workers have the 
highest rate of nonfatal assault injuries. Nurses are three 
times more likely to experience workplace violence than 
any other professional group.253 In one Los Angeles inci-
dent, a former patient shot and critically wounded three 
doctors because his demands for painkillers had gone un-
heeded.254 There are a variety of responses to workplace 
provocations. Some people take out their anger and aggres-
sion by attacking their supervisors in an effort to punish 
the company that dismissed them; this is a form of murder 
by proxy.255 Disgruntled employees may also attack family 
members or friends, misdirecting the rage and frustration 
caused by their work situation. Others are content with 
sabotaging company equipment; computer databases are 
particularly vulnerable to tampering. The aggrieved party 
may do nothing to rectify the situation; this inaction is re-
ferred to as sufferance. Over time, the unresolved confl ict 
may be compounded by other events that cause an even-
tual eruption.
The Extent of Workplace Violence According to secu-
rity experts Michael Mantell and Steve Albrecht, the cost of 
workplace violence for American businesses runs more than 
$4 billion annually, including lost work time, employee 
medical benefi ts, legal expenses, replacing lost employees 
and retraining new ones, decreased productivity, higher in-
surance premiums, raised security costs, bad publicity, lost 
business, and expensive litigation.256
These huge costs can be explained by the fact that, on 
average, 1.7 million people are the victims of violent crime 
while working or on duty in the United States. An estimated 
1.3 million (75 percent) of these incidents are simple as-
saults while an additional 19 percent are aggravated assaults. 
Of the occupations examined, police offi cers, corrections of-
fi cers, and taxi drivers were victimized at the highest rates. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Census of Fatal Occupational 
Injuries (CFOI) reported that about 12,000 workplace ho-
micides have occurred since 1992; like other violent crimes, 
the number has been in decline.257
Can Workplace Violence Be Controlled? One approach 
is to use third parties to mediate disputes. The restorative 
justice movement (discussed in Chapter 8) advocates the 
use of mediation to resolve interpersonal disputes. Re-
storative justice techniques may work particularly well in 
the workplace, where disputants know one another, and 
. . . shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate 
a person or group.” The Court ruled that cross burning was 
intertwined with the Ku Klux Klan and its reign of terror 
throughout the South. The Court has long held that state-
ments in which the speaker intends to communicate intent 
to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular indi-
vidual or group of individuals is not protected free speech 
and can be criminalized; the speaker need not actually in-
tend to carry out the threat.248
Workplace Violence
On August 3, 2010, Omar Thornton, 34, a driver forced to 
resign after being caught stealing beer from the warehouse 
where he worked, returned to work and went on a shooting 
rampage, killing eight people and injuring two before com-
mitting suicide.249
Thornton’s violent outburst is sadly not unique. It has 
become commonplace to read of irate employees or former 
employees attacking coworkers or sabotaging machinery and 
production lines. Workplace violence is now considered 
one of the leading causes of occupational injury or death.250 
Workplace violence can take a number of different forms:
TYPE 1. Violent acts by criminals who have no other 
connection with the workplace, but enter to commit 
robbery or another crime.
TYPE 2. Violence directed at employees by customers, 
clients, patients, students, inmates, or any others for 
whom an organization provides services.
TYPE 3. Violence against coworkers, supervisors, or 
managers by a present or former employee.
TYPE 4. Violence committed in the workplace by 
someone who doesn’t work there, but has a personal 
relationship with an employee—an abusive spouse or 
domestic partner.251
Who engages in workplace violence? The typical of-
fender is a middle-aged white male who faces termination 
in a worsening economy. The fear of economic ruin is es-
pecially strong in agencies such as the U.S. Postal Service, 
where long-term employees fear job loss because of automa-
tion and reorganization. In contrast, younger workers usu-
ally kill while committing a robbery or another felony.
Creating Workplace Violence A number of factors pre-
cipitate workplace violence. One suspected cause is a man-
agement style that appears cold and insensitive to workers. 
As corporations cut their staffs because of some economic 
downturn or workers are summarily replaced with cost-
 effective technology, long-term employees may become irate 
and irrational; their unexpected layoff can lead to violent re-
actions.252 The effect is most pronounced when managers 
are unsympathetic and nonsupportive; their callous attitude 
may help trigger workplace violence.

that increases the risk of stalking compared to women in the 
general population, these data make it clear that stalking is a 
very widespread phenomenon.
Most victims know their stalker. A 2007 meta-analysis 
of existing research conducted by Brian Spitzberg and Wil-
liam Cupach found that most stalking (79 percent) emerged 
from preexisting relationships and about half of all stalking 
emerged specifi cally from romantic relationships.263
Women are most likely to be stalked by an intimate 
partner—a current spouse, a former spouse, someone they 
lived with, or even a date. In contrast, men typically are 
stalked by a stranger or an acquaintance. The typical female 
victim is stalked because her assailant wants to control her, 
scare her, or keep her in a relationship. Victims of both gen-
ders fi nd that there is a clear relationship between stalking 
and other emotionally controlling and physically abusive 
behavior. Some psychologists believe that most stalkers are 
persons with mental illness who create social and public 
problems due to their violent behavior.264
Stalkers behave in ways that induce fear, but they do not 
always make overt threats against their victims. Many fol-
low or spy upon their victims, some threaten to kill pets, 
and others vandalize property. Criminologist Mary Brewster 
found that stalkers who make verbal threats are the ones 
most likely to later attack their victims.265 However, it is not 
uncommon for stalking to end in violence. In their review, 
Spitzberg and Cupach found that 32 percent of stalking 
cases involved physical violence and about 12 percent in-
volved sexual violence.266
Though stalking is a serious problem, research indicates 
that many cases are dropped by the courts even though the 
stalkers often have extensive criminal histories and are fre-
quently the subject of protective orders. A lenient response 
may be misplaced considering that there is evidence that 
stalkers repeat their criminal activity within a short time of 
the lodging of a stalking charge with police authorities.267 
Victims experience its social and psychological conse-
quences long afterward. About one-third seek psychological 
treatment, and about one-fi fth lose time from work; some 
never return to work.
Why does stalking stop? Most often because the victim 
moved away or the police got involved or, in some cases, 
when the stalker met another love interest.

tensions may be simmering over a long period. This may 
help control the rising tide of workplace violence. Another 
idea is a human resources approach, with aggressive job re-
training and continued medical coverage after layoffs; it is 
also important to use objective, fair hearings to thwart un-
fair or biased terminations. Perhaps rigorous screening tests 
can help identify violence-prone workers so that they can 
be given anger management training. Most importantly, em-
ployers may want to establish policies restricting weapons 
in the workplace: recent research shows that workplaces 
where guns were specifically permitted are five to seven 
times more likely to be the site of a worker homicide than 
those where all weapons were prohibited.258
Stalking
In Wes Craven’s popular Scream movies, the heroine Sydney 
(played by Neve Campbell) is pursued by a mysterious ad-
versary who scares her half to death while killing off most 
of her peer group. Although obviously extreme even by 
Hollywood standards, the Scream movies focus on a newly 
recognized form of long-term and repeat victimization: 
stalking.259
While it is a complex phenomenon, stalking can be de-
fi ned as a course of conduct directed at a specifi c person 
that involves repeated physical or visual proximity, non-
consensual communication, or verbal, written, or implied 
threats suffi cient to cause fear in a reasonable person.260
How big a problem is stalking? Kathleen Basile and her 
associates used a large national sample of almost 10,000 
adults to determine the prevalence of stalking in the United 
States. Analysis showed about 4.5 percent of adults reported 
having been stalked. Women had signifi cantly higher preva-
lence (7 percent) of stalking victimization than did men 
(2 percent). People who were never married (or who were 
separated, widowed, or divorced) had signifi cantly higher 
odds of being stalked than those who were married or had a 
partner. People aged 55 years or older and those who were 
retired were least likely to report stalking victimization. 
Stalking affects nearly 1 in 22 adults or almost 10 million 
people, approximately 80 percent of whom are women, at 
sometime during their life.261
While this research is disturbing, it may actually under-
count the problem. Bonnie Fisher and her associates found 
that about 13 percent of the women in a nationally drawn 
sample of more than 4,000 college women were the victims 
of stalking. Considering that there are more than 6.5 mil-
lion women attending college in the United States, about 
700,000 women are being stalked each year on college cam-
puses alone.262 Though students most likely have a lifestyle

364  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
 1. Be familiar with the various 
causes of violent crime
Violence has become an all-too-
 
■
common aspect of modern life. 
Among the various explanations 
of sources of violent crime are 
exposure to violence, personal 
traits and makeup, evolutionary 
factors and human instincts, 
cultural values and a subcul-
ture of violence, substance 
abuse, and socialization and 
upbringing.
 2. Be able to discuss the history of 
rape and know the different 
types of rape
Rape, the carnal knowledge of a 
 
■
female forcibly and against her 
will, has been known through-
out history, but the view of rape 
has evolved. Rape has been an 
instrument of war for thou-
sands of years. There are nu-
merous forms of rape, including 
statutory, acquaintance, and 
date rape.
 3. Discuss the legal issues in rape 
prosecution
Rape is an extremely diffi cult 
 
■
charge to prove in court. The 
victim’s lack of consent must 
be proven; therefore, it almost 
seems that the victim is on trial. 
Rape shield laws have been de-
veloped to protect victims from 
having their personal life placed 
on trial.
 4. Recognize that there are differ-
ent degrees of murder
Murder is defi ned as killing 
 
■
a human being with malice 
aforethought. There are dif-
ferent degrees of murder, and 
punishments vary accordingly. 
First-degree murder involves 
malice and premeditation. Sec-
ond-degree murder requires 
malice aforethought but not 
premeditation or deliberation. 
Voluntary manslaughter refers 
to a killing, typically without 
a weapon, committed in the 
heat of passion or during a 
sudden quarrel that provoked 
violence. Although intent 
may be present, malice is not. 
Involuntary or negligent man-
slaughter refers to a killing 
that occurs when a person’s 
acts are negligent and without 
regard for the harm they may 
cause others.
 5. Be able to discuss the differ-
ences among serial killing, mass 
murder, and spree killing
Murder can involve a single 
 
■
victim or be a serial killing, 
mass murder, or spree killing, 
which involve multiple victims. 
The difference between a spree 
killer and a serial killer is that 
the latter retains his or her 
identity and kills secretly. The 
spree killer abandons his or her 
normal identity and continues 
killing until he or she is identi-
fi ed and captured.
 6. Discuss the concept of murder 
transaction
One important characteristic 
 
■
of murder is that the victim 
and criminal often know each 
other. Murder often involves 
an interpersonal transaction in 
which a hostile action by the 
victim precipitates a murderous 
relationship. In some instances, 
it is the victim who initiates the 
murderous transaction, such as 
a barroom brawl, and is killed 
in the aftermath.
 7. Be familiar with the nature 
of assault
Assault involves physically 
 
■
harming another. Assault 
requires no actual touching 
(which is called battery) but 
involves frightening the victim 
by word or deed. Assaults often 
occur in the home, including 
child abuse and spousal abuse. 
There also appears to be a trend 
toward violence between dating 
couples.
SUMMARY
 8. Know the root causes of child 
abuse
 A number of factors have 
 
■
been commonly linked to 
abuse and neglect. Family 
violence seems to be perpetu-
ated from one generation to 
another within families. The 
behavior of abusive parents 
can often be traced to negative 
experiences in their own child-
hood. Blended families, which 
include children living with an 
unrelated adult such as a step-
parent or another unrelated 
co-resident, have also been 
linked to abuse. Parents may 
also become abusive if they are 
isolated from friends, neigh-
bors, or relatives who can help 
in times of crisis.
 9. Understand the defi nition and 
concept of robbery
The defi nition of robbery is “the 
 
■
taking or attempting to take 
anything of value from the care, 
custody or control of a person 
or persons by force or threat 
of force or violence and/or by 
putting the victim in fear.” A 
robbery is considered a violent 
crime because it involves the 
use of force to obtain money 
or goods. Robbery is punished 
severely because the victim’s life 
is put in jeopardy. In fact, the 
severity of punishment is based 
on the amount of force used 
during the crime, not the value 
of the items taken. Robbery that 
involves people who know each 
other is acquaintance robbery.
 10. Be able to discuss newly emerg-
ing forms of violence such as 
stalking, hate crimes, and work-
place violence
Hate crimes usually involve con-
 
■
venient, vulnerable targets who 
are incapable of fi ghting back. 
People become the target of hate 
crimes because of their religion, 
ethnicity, or race, or because

SINCE
Since 9/11, the world has been so fi lled with violence that an attack taking place in Somalia on August 24, 
2010, that killed 33 people received almost no media attention. Somali insurgents dressed as police offi cers 
stormed a Mogadishu hotel on Tuesday morning and opened fi re before fi ghting with security police and 
committing suicide rather than being captured. Among the dead were six government offi cials. Al-Shabaab, 
a Somali insurgent group allied with al-Qaeda, readily admitted carrying out the attack, part of their ongoing 
effort to topple the government. And by no means was this their fi rst attack on government offi cials. In 
December 2009, al-Shabaab killed four government ministers in a suicide bombing at a medical school 
graduation in the capital city of Mogadishu.1

Azerbaijan. According to watchdog group Amnesty Interna-
tional, harassment and ill treatment of opposition journal-
ists by police and other government offi cials have become 
routine. The government is bent on silencing these journal-
ists through arrest and imprisonment on dubious charges 
or by levying heavy fi nes following trials for criminal defa-
mation. In contrast, there have been no instances of attacks 
on progovernment journalists in Azerbaijan.4 Similarly, 
people whom some label as terrorists and insurrectionists 
are viewed by others as freedom fi ghters and revolutionar-
ies. What would have happened to George Washington and 
Benjamin Franklin had the British won the Revolutionary 
War? Would they have been hanged for their political crimes 
or considered heroes and freedom fi ghters?
The Nature of Political Crimes
The political criminal and political crimes may stem from 
religious or ideological sources. Because their motivations 
shift between selfi sh personal needs and selfl ess, noble, or 
altruistic desires, political crimes often occupy a gray area 
between conventional and outlawed behavior. It is easy to 
condemn interpersonal violent crimes such as rape or mur-
der because their goals are typically selfi sh and self-centered. 
(e.g., revenge or profi t). In contrast, political criminals may 
be motivated by conviction rather than greed or anger. While 
it is true that some political crime involves profi t (such as 
selling state secrets for money), most political criminals do 
not consider themselves antisocial but instead patriotic and 
altruistic. They are willing to sacrifi ce themselves for what 
they consider to be the greater good. While some concoct 
elaborate schemes to hide or mask their actions, others are 
quite brazen, hoping to provoke the government to over-
react in their zeal to crack down on dissent. Because state 
authorities may engage in a range of retaliatory actions that 
result in human rights violations, even those who support 
the government may begin to question its activities: maybe 
the government is corrupt and authoritarian? On the other 
hand, if the government does nothing, it appears weak and 
corrupt and unable to protect citizens.
Even those political criminals who profi t personally from 
their misdeeds, such as someone who spies for an enemy 
Terror attacks have become so routine that nothing seems to surprise us anymore. How many of you 
remember that on December 27, 2007, Pakistani political leader Benazir Bhutto was assassinated while 
leaving an election rally in Rawalpindi? Or that her death was linked to Baitullah Mehsud, a militant leader 
connected to al-Qaeda and other terror groups? Or that after her death her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, became 
president of Pakistan?
T
The attacks in Somalia and the death of Benazir Bhutto are 
just two in a continuing string of terrorist acts that have 
rocked the world since 9/11. As a result, political crime 
and terrorism have become important areas of criminologi-
cal inquiry, and many criminologists who previously paid 
scant attention to the interaction between political motiva-
tion and crime have now made it the focus of intense study. 
This chapter reviews both violent and nonviolent political 
crime. We will briefl y discuss the concept of political crime 
and some of its various forms, and then turn to its most 
extreme variety, terrorism. Because terrorism now occupies 
the center stage of both world opinion and government pol-
icy, it is important for students of criminology to develop a 
basic understanding of its defi nition, history, and structure, 
and review the steps being taken to limit or eliminate its 
occurrence.

POLITICAL CRIME
While terrorism now occupies the focal point of public con-
cern, it is merely one of many different types of politically 
motivated crimes. The term political crime is used to sig-
nify illegal acts that are designed to undermine an existing 
government and threaten its survival.2 Political crimes can 
include both violent and nonviolent acts and range in se-
riousness from dissent, treason, and espionage to terrorism 
and assassination.3
When an act becomes a political crime and when an 
actor is considered a political criminal are often extremely 
subjective. In highly repressive nations, any form of non-
sanctioned political activity, including writing a newspaper 
article critical of the regime, may be considered a political 
crime, punishable by a prison term or even death. Take for 
instance the current situation in the central Asian nation of

CHAPTER 11 | Political Crime and Terrorism  375
Becoming a Political Criminal
Why does someone become a political criminal? There is 
no set pattern or reason; motivations vary widely. Some use 
political crime as a stepping stone to public offi ce while 
others use it as a method to focus their frustrations. Others 
hope they can gain respect from their friends and family. 
Although the motivations for political crime are complex 
and varied, there does appear to be some regularity in the 
way ideas are formed. Political crime expert Randy Borum 
fi nds that this pattern takes the form of a series of cogni-
tive stages:
Stage 1: 
 
■
“It’s not right.” An unhappy, dissatisfi ed indi-
vidual identifi es some type of undesirable event or condi-
tion. It could be economic (e.g., poverty, unemployment, 
poor living conditions), social (e.g., government-
imposed restrictions on individual freedoms, lack of 
order, or morality), or personal (“I am being cheated of 
what is due me”). While the conditions may vary, those 
involved perceive the experience as “things are not as 
they should be.”
Stage 2: 
 
■
“It’s not fair.” The prospective criminal 
 concludes that the undesirable condition is a prod-
uct of “injustice”—that is, it does not apply to every-
one. A government worker may feel his or her low 
pay scale is “not right” and that corporate workers 
with less skill are making more money and getting 
more benefits. At the same time, government work-
ers are portrayed as lazy and corrupt. For those who 
are deprived, this facilitates feelings of resentment 
and injustice.
Stage 3: 
 
■
“It’s your fault.” Someone or some group must 
be held accountable for the extremist’s displeasure. It 
always helps to identify a potential target. For example, 
the underpaid worker may become convinced that 
minorities get all the good jobs while the worker is suf-
fering fi nancially. Extremist groups spread this propa-
ganda to attract recruits. Americans may be portrayed 
as rich and undeserving by overseas enemies looking 
to recruit disenfranchised young men and women to 
become terrorists.
Stage 4: 
 
■
“You’re evil.” Because good people would not 
intentionally hurt others, targeted groups are appropri-
ate choices for revenge and/or violence. The disaffected 
government worker concludes that since his country 
has let him down it is only fair to sell state secrets to 
foreign nations for profi t or to join a terrorist group 
or both. Aggression becomes justifi able when aimed 
against bad people, particularly those who intentionally 
cause harm to others. Second, by casting the target as 
evil, it dehumanizes them and makes justifying aggres-
sion even easier. So it’s not so bad to rig an election, 
because the opposing candidates are evil and do not de-
serve to hold offi ce.7
nation for fi nancial payoffs, may believe that their acts are 
motivated by a higher calling than common theft. “My ulti-
mate goal is to weaken or overthrow a corrupt government,” 
they reason, “so selling secrets to the enemy is justifi ed.” 
Political criminals may believe that their acts are criminal-
ized only because the group holding power fears them and 
wants to curtail their behavior. And while the general public 
has little objection to laws that control extreme behaviors 
such as plotting a bloody revolution, they may have ques-
tions when a law criminalizes ordinary political dissent or 
bans political meetings in order to control suspected politi-
cal criminals.
The Goals of Political Crime
On August 24, 2010, another in a very long series of bomb-
ings took place in Iraq. While the population has gotten 
used to these attacks, this one was clearly designed to un-
dermine public confi dence in the nation’s security forces. 
The bombers wanted to exploit political uncertainty and 
undermine the public’s trust in Iraq’s political parties to 
form a government. One survivor told reporters, “There 
may be a state, there may be a government. But what can 
that state do? What can they do with all the terrorists? Are 
they supposed to set up a checkpoint in every house?” 
The bombers may have succeeded in their efforts to create 
an atmosphere of intimidation and fear designed to oust 
the government.5
While common criminals may be motivated by greed, 
vengeance, or jealousy, political criminals have a somewhat 
different agenda. Rather than personal profi t, their acts are 
aimed at achieving a different set of goals:
Intimidation. 
 
■
Some political criminals want to intimidate 
or threaten an opponent who does not share their po-
litical orientation or views.
Revolution.
 
■
 Some political criminals plot to overthrow 
the existing government and replace it with one that 
holds views they fi nd more acceptable.
Profi t.
 
■
 Another goal of political crime is profi t: selling 
state secrets for personal enrichment or traffi cking in 
stolen arms and munitions.
Conviction.
 
■
 Some political criminals are motivated by al-
truism; they truly believe their crimes will benefi t society 
and are willing to violate the law and risk punishment in 
order to achieve what they see as social improvement.
Pseudo-conviction.
 
■
 These political criminals conceal 
conventional criminal motivations behind a mask of 
conviction and altruism. They may form a revolutionary 
movement out of a hidden desire to engage in violence 
rather than their stated goal of reforming society. The 
pseudo-convictional criminal is particularly dangerous 
because they convince followers to join them in their 
crimes without fully revealing their true motivations.6

won the presidential election over opposition candidate 
Raila Odinga, fi ghting broke out that tore this African na-
tion apart. More than 1,200 Kenyans were reported killed, 
thousands more injured, hundreds of thousands made 
homeless; more than 40,000 houses, farms, and businesses 
were looted or destroyed.10 Despite the post-election chaos, 
Kibaki retained his victory and his power.
Election fraud, a feature of political life since Roman 
times, includes a variety of behaviors designed to give a can-
didate or his/her party an unfair advantage:
Intimidation.
 
■
 Voters can be scared away from the polls 
through threats or intimidation. Having armed guards 
posted at polling places may convince people it is danger-
ous to vote. Lists of registered voters can be obtained and 
people subjected to threatening calls before the election.
Disruption. 
 
■
Bomb threats can be called into voting places 
in areas that are known to heavily favor the opposing 
party, with the goal of suppressing the vote. There can 
be outright sabotage of polling places, ballots, ballot 
boxes, and voting machines (see Exhibit 11.1).
TYPES OF POLITICAL 
CRIMES
Considering this cognitive thought that produces political 
crime and terrorism, what are the specifi c crimes and what 
form do they take?
Election Fraud
On October 31, 2007, the Federal Election Commission 
(FEC) announced that it had levied a $1 million fine on 
Mitchell Wade and his company, MZM, Inc., a high-tech na-
tional security fi rm based in Washington, D.C. It was the 
second-largest penalty ever paid in the 32-year history of 
the FEC. According to the FEC, Wade funneled $78,000 in 
corporate contributions to two political candidates, repre-
sentatives Virgil Goode and Katherine Harris, by giving cash 
to employees of MZM, and in some cases their spouses, and 
then instructing them to make contributions.8 Why were 
Wade’s activities a crime? Because federal law limits an indi-
vidual’s political contributions to $2,300 per candidate, and 
Wade clearly intended to circumvent the law by using prox-
ies for his contributions.9
Some political criminals want to shape elections to meet 
their personal needs. In some instances their goal is altruis-
tic: the election of candidates who refl ect their personal po-
litical views. In others, their actions are motivated by profi t: 
they are paid by a candidate to rig the election.
Whatever the motive, election fraud is illegal interference 
with the process of an election. Acts of fraud tend to involve af-
fecting vote counts to bring about a desired election outcome, 
whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, 
depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both.
In some third-world dictatorships, election fraud is the 
norm, and it is common for the ruling party to announce, 
after party members counted the votes, that they were re-
turned to offi ce with an overwhelming majority. Sometimes 
allegations of voter fraud by ruling juntas can have disas-
trous consequences. Take for instance the parliamentary 
elections that took place in Kenya on December 27, 2007. 
When it was announced that President Mwai Kibaki had 
Borum’s typology seems similar to the techniques of 
neutralization discussed in Chapter 7. Is it possible that 
terrorists must neutralize feelings of guilt and shame 
before planting their bombs? Or do their religious and 
political beliefs negate any need for psychological pro-
cess to reduce personal responsibility for violence?
CONNECTIONS
EXHIBIT 11.1 
Political Violence in Nepal
In the mountainous Asian nation of Nepal, a 10-year conflict 
between Maoist insurgents, the police, and the army claimed 
more than 13,000 lives. In November 2006, Nepal’s coali-
tion government and the Communist Party of Nepal (Mao-
ist) signed a comprehensive peace agreement to end the 
fighting. The Nepali Army and Maoists agreed to participate 
in elections to create a constituent assembly that would re-
write the country’s constitution, including whether it would 
remain a monarchy. During the election campaign, support-
ers of all major parties clashed almost daily. On April 6, 2008, 
the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) reported that 
“election-related violence and intimidation by party workers 
continues, with frequent and sometimes severe clashes be-
tween political parties in many districts.” UNMIN said that the 
Youth Communist League and other Maoist cadres were in-
volved in the largest proportion of incidents. On April 7, 2008, 
even as campaigning drew to a close, 12 people were injured 
in bomb attacks. On April 8, unknown assailants shot dead 
Rishi Prasad Sharma, a candidate for the Communist Party 
of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist). But in spite of clashes and 
bombings in the weeks leading up the polls, the Nepalese 
Election Commission said that only 33 of the 21,000 polling 
booths had to be shut as a result of the violence, an outcome 
that was actually better than expected.

general election. . . .
This provision is in the Civil Rights section of Title 18, the 
federal criminal code, and it protects the right of all citizens 
to vote and campaign for offi ce.
Treason
Few people can forget the image of John Walker Lindh, the 
so-called American Taliban, when he was captured during 
the American invasion of Afghanistan. Lindh, who had spent 
his early years in an affl uent northern California community, 
converted to Islam and through a convoluted path wound 
up fi rst in an al-Qaeda training camp and then fi ghting with 
the Taliban on the front lines in Afghanistan. He was cap-
tured on November 25, 2001, by Afghan Northern Alliance 
forces, and questioned by CIA agents. Later that day, there 
was a violent uprising in the prison in which he was being 
held and during the attack a CIA agent was killed. Walker 
escaped only to be recaptured seven days later. At his trial, 
he apologized for fighting alongside the Taliban, saying, 
“Had I realized then what I know now . . . I never would 
have joined them.” The 21-year-old said Osama bin Laden is 
against Islam and that he “never understood jihad to mean 
anti-American or terrorism.” (See Exhibit 11.2.) “I under-
stand why so many Americans were angry when I was fi rst 
Misinformation.

 Flyers are sent out to voters registered 
with the opposition party containing misleading infor-
mation such as the wrong election date or saying that 
rules have been changed about who is eligible to vote.
Registration fraud. 
 
■
Political operatives may try to shape 
the outcome of an election by busing in ineligible vot-
ers from other districts. Because many jurisdictions 
require minimal identifi cation and proof of citizenship, 
political criminals fi nd it easy to get around residency 
requirements. They may provide conspirators with 
“change of address” forms to allow them to vote in a 
particular election, when in fact no actual change of 
address has occurred.
Vote buying.
 
■
 Securing votes by payment or other rewards 
or the selling of one’s vote is an age-old problem that 
still exists. One popular method is to buy absentee bal-
lots from people who are in need of cash. The fraudu-
lent voter can then ensure that the vote goes their way, 
an outcome that cannot be guaranteed if the conspirator 
casts a secret ballot at a polling place.
Most states have created laws to control and punish vote 
fraud. The federal government has a number of statutes de-
signed to control and/or restrict fraud, including 18 U.S.C. 
§ 594, which provides:
Whoever intimidates, threatens, coerces, or attempts 
to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any other person for 
the purpose of interfering with the right of such other 
person to vote or to vote as he may choose, or of caus-
ing such other person to vote for, or 
not to vote for, any candidate for the 
offi ce of President, Vice President, 
Presidential elector, Member of the 
Senate, Member of the House of 
Representatives, Delegate from the 
District of Columbia, or Resident 
Commissioner, at any election held 
solely or in part for the purpose of 
electing such candidate, shall be 
fi ned under this title or imprisoned 
not more than one year, or both.
Another provision that applies to voting 
is 18 U.S.C. § 245(b)(1)(A):
Whoever, whether or not acting un-
der color of law, by force or threat of 
force willfully injures, intimidates or 
interferes with, or attempts to injure, 
intimidate or interfere with (1) any 
person because he is or has been, or 
in order to intimidate such person 
or any other person or any class of 
persons from (A) voting or qualify-
ing to vote, qualifying or campaign-
ing as a candidate for elective offi ce,

Treason involves acts of disloyalty to one’s nation. A person who willfully cooperates with an 
enemy is considered to be a traitor. John Walker Lindh, the so-called “American Taliban,” is 
shown being taken into custody at Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan. Calling himself Abdul Hamid, 
Lindh volunteered to help the enemy. Though some people considered his actions 
treasonous, in a plea bargain Lindh admitted only to serving in the Taliban army and 
carrying weapons and received a 20-year sentence for his crimes.

378  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
particularly loathsome under English common law, and un-
til the nineteenth century it was punishable by being “drawn 
and quartered,” a method of execution that involved hang-
ing the offender, removing their intestines while still living, 
and fi nally cutting the offender into four pieces for public 
display. William Wallace, the Scottish patriot made famous 
in the fi lm Braveheart, was so displayed after his execution.
Acts can be considered treasonous in order to stifl e po-
litical dissent. In eighteenth century England, it was consid-
ered treasonous to merely criticize the king or his behavior, 
and not surprisingly, the American colonists feared giving 
their own central government that much power. Therefore 
treason is the only crime mentioned in the United States 
Constitution, which defi nes treason as levying war against 
the United States or “in adhering to their Enemies, giving 
them Aid and Comfort,” and requires the testimony of two 
witnesses or a confession in open court for conviction. The 
purpose of this was to limit the government’s ability to bring 
charges of treason against opponents and to make it more 
diffi cult to prosecute those who are so charged.13
Today, the United States Criminal Code codifi es treason 
as “whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war 
against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid 
and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty 
of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not 
less than fi ve years and fi ned under this title but not less than 
$10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any offi ce under 
the United States.”14 Helping or cooperating with the enemy 
in a time of war (as Lindh did) would be considered treason; 
so too would be creating or recruiting a military force to help 
a foreign nation overthrow the government. After World 
War II, two women, Iva Ikuko Toguri D’Aquino, a Japanese 
American born in Los Angeles and known as Tokyo Rose, 
and Mildred Elizabeth Gillars, born in Portland, Maine, and 
known as Axis Sally, served prison terms for broadcasting for 
the Axis powers in an effort to demoralize American troops. 
The fi rst treason charge in the past 50 years was actually lev-
ied against a California man, Adam Gadahn, whose case is 
summarized in the Profi les in Crime feature.
Espionage
Robert Hanssen was a counterintelligence agent for the FBI 
assigned to detect and identify Russian spies. A former Chi-
cago police officer, Hanssen’s assignment required him to 
have access to sensitive top-secret information. In one of the 
most shocking cases in U.S. history, Hanssen volunteered to 
become a paid spy for the KGB during the Cold War and over 
a period of 15 years received at least $1.4 million in cash and 
diamonds. He was arrested on February 18, 2001, after leav-
ing a package of classifi ed documents for his Russian handlers 
under a footbridge in a park outside Washington. During his 
years as a double agent, Hanssen not only provided more 
than 6,000 pages of documents to the Soviet Union but also 
caused the death of two U.S. double agents whose identities 
discovered in Afghanistan. I realize many still are, but I hope 
in time that feeling will change.” After a plea agreement, 
John Walker Lindh was sentenced to 20 years in prison.11
Lindh’s behavior amounts to what is commonly called 
treason, an act of disloyalty to one’s nation or state. While 
the crime of treason is well known and the word “traitor” is
a generic term, there have actually been fewer than 40 pros-
ecutions for treason in the entire history of the United States 
and most have resulted in acquittal. In fact, though his be-
havior might be considered treasonous, Lindh was not actu-
ally charged or convicted of treason but was charged with 
serving in the Taliban army and carrying weapons.
While the Lindh case grabbed headlines, the most fa-
mous treason case in U.S. history is still the 1807 trial of 
former Vice President Aaron Burr, a man best known for 
killing Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton in 
1804 in a duel over a matter of honor. Burr was accused 
of hatching a plot to separate the western states from the 
union. When that plot went awry, he conspired to seize 
Mexico and set up a puppet government with himself as 
king! Arrested on charges of treason, he was acquitted 
when the Federal Court, headed by John Marshall, ruled 
that to be guilty of treason an overt act must be committed; 
planning is not enough.12
Because treason is considered such a heinous crime, and 
to deter would-be traitors, many nations apply or have ap-
plied the death penalty to those convicted of attempting to 
overthrow the existing government. Treason was considered 
EXHIBIT 11.2 
What Is Jihad?
When John Walker Lindh used the word jihad, he made refer-
ence to a term that has become all too familiar in contem-
porary society. Often assumed to mean “holy war,” the term 
is more complex than that simple meaning. According to ter-
ror expert Andrew Silke, the term derives from the Arabic for 
“struggle,” and within Islam there are two forms of jihad: the 
Greater Jihad and the Lesser Jihad. The Greater Jihad refers 
to a Muslim’s personal struggle to live a good and charitable 
life and adhere to God’s commands. In this sense, jihad is a 
strictly personal and nonviolent phenomenon. The Lesser Ji-
had refers to violent struggle on behalf of Islam. Jihadists are 
“those who struggle” and refers to individuals who have volun-
teered to fight in the Lesser Jihad. The term is used by mem-
bers of groups such as al-Qaeda to describe themselves and 
their goals. Jihadists sometimes call themselves mujahideen, 
meaning “holy warriors,” and the term is commonly used to 
refer to Muslims engaged in the Lesser Jihad.

Espionage involves obtaining the information illegally by 
covertly entering the area where the information is stored, 
secretly photographing forbidden areas, or subverting 
through threat or payoff people who know the information

were uncovered with the aid of his secret documents. The

Espionage (more commonly called “spying”) is the 
practice of obtaining information about a government, orga-
nization, or society that is considered secret or confi dential 
himself as Azzam the American and an-
nounced his relationship with al-Qaeda. 
“The streets of America shall run red with 
blood,” he claimed. In a broadcast in 
2005, around the fourth anniversary of the 
9/11 attacks, Gadahn called the attacks 
“blessed raids” and discussed the “jihad 
against America.” In 2006, Gadahn ap-
peared in a videotape that also contained 
statements from Osama bin Laden and Ay-
man al-Zawahiri and then made another 
propaganda broadcast aired on the fifth 
anniversary of 9/11. On May 29, 2007, 
Gadahn again made headlines when he 
issued another video that listed six actions 
that America must take in order to prevent 
future terrorist attacks:
“Pull every last one of your soldiers, 
 
■
spies, security advisors, trainers, atta-
chés . . . out of every Muslim land from 
Afghanistan to Zanzibar. . . .”
End “all support and aid, military, po-
 
■
litical, economic, or otherwise, to the 
56-plus apostate regimes of the Muslim 
world, and abandon them to their well-
deserved fate.”
“End all support, moral, military, eco-
 
■
nomic, political, or otherwise, to the 
bastard state of Israel, and ban your 
citizens, Zionist Jews, Zionist Christians, 
and the rest from traveling to occupied 
Palestine or settling there. Even one 
penny of aid will be considered sufficient 
justification to continue the fight.”
“Leave all Muslims alone.”
 
■
“Impose a blanket ban on all broadcasts 
 
■
to our region.”
“Free all Muslim captives from your pris-
 
■
ons, detention facilities, and concentra-
tion camps, regardless of whether they 
have been recipients of what you call a 
fair trial or not.”
Gadahn warned:
Your failure to meet our demands . 
. . means that you and your people 
will, Allah willing, experience things 
which will make you forget about the 
horrors of September 11. . . . This is 
not a call for negotiations. We do not 
negotiate with baby killers and war 
criminals like you.
Gadahn also warned President George W. 
Bush: 
You will go down in history not only 
as the president who embroiled his 
nation in a series of unwinnable and 
bloody conflicts in the Islamic world, 
but as the president who set the 
United States up on its death march.
Gadahn is the first person to be charged 
with treason against the United States 
in almost 50 years, and while there have 
been numerous reports of his death and 
capture, none have so far proven valid. On 
March 7, 2010, the Pakistani government 
announced that Gadahn had been cap-
tured in Karachi, Pakistan, in late Febru-
ary 2010. However, this report has since 
been disputed and Gadahn’s whereabouts 
remain a mystery.

Azzam the American
The most recent case in which actual trea-
son has been charged involves a 28-year-
old California man, Adam Gadahn, also 
known as Azzam the American, who was 
indicted in 2006 for making a series of pro-
paganda videotapes for al-Qaeda, including 
one in which he praised the 9/11 hijackers 
and referred to the United States as “en-
emy soil.”
Gadahn was raised in a counterculture 
atmosphere on a rural farm with his father, 
Philip Pearlstein, the son of a well-known 
Jewish doctor, and his mother, Jennifer, a 
computer whiz from Pennsylvania. His par-
ents were self-sufficient and raised their son 
in a cabin with no running water; they pro-
duced their own electricity from solar pan-
els. They hoped that by living in isolation 
and austerity they could avoid the chaotic 
and destructive elements of contemporary 
society. Adam Gadahn became heavily in-
volved in the death metal culture, but, still 
feeling empty and alienated, began study-
ing Islam at age 17 at the Islamic Society of 
Orange County. He later moved to Pakistan 
and married an Afghan woman.
Gadahn appeared in a series of video-
taped segments that were broadcast be-
tween October 2004 and September 11, 
2006. In the first tape, Gadahn is shown 
wearing black sunglasses and a headdress 
wrapped around his face. He identified

Pereverzeva, agents of the Russian Federation. The case was 
settled when the Russians were exchanged for four Ameri-
can spies being held in Russian prisons.
Not all spies are foreign nationals. There are numerous 
cases of homegrown spies who are motivated by misguided 
altruism or belief. Perhaps the most famous international 
case involved a group of fi ve upper-crust students recruited 
during the Cold War at prestigious Cambridge University 
in England by Russia’s foreign intelligence service, the KGB. 
The fi ve were motivated by the belief that capitalism was 
corrupt and that the Soviet Union offered a better model 
Espionage is typically associated with spying on poten-
tial or actual enemies, by a foreign agent who is working 
for his or her nation’s intelligence service. With the end of 
the Cold War, the threat of espionage seemed reduced un-
til 2010, when a major Russian spy group was unraveled 
and 10 people arrested. These were sleeper agents who had 
spent decades fi tting seamlessly in their new environment. 
Neighbors were shocked to fi nd out that “Richard Murphy” 
and “Cynthia Murphy” were actually spies named Vladi-
mir Guryev and Lydia Guryev, while “Michael Zottoli” and 
“Patricia Mills” were in reality Mikhail Kutsik and Natalia 
CIA’s Soviet/East European Division at CIA 
Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, he se-
cretly volunteered to KGB officers at the 
USSR Embassy in Washington, D.C. Shortly 
thereafter, the KGB paid him $50,000. Dur-
ing the summer of 1985, Ames met several 
times with a Russian diplomat to whom he 
passed classified information about CIA 
and FBI human sources, as well as techni-
cal operations targeting the Soviet Union. In 
December 1985, Ames met with a Moscow-
based KGB officer in Bogota, Colombia. In 
July 1986, Ames was transferred to Rome.
In Rome, Ames continued his meetings 
with the KGB, including a Russian diplomat 
assigned to Rome and a Moscow-based KGB 
officer. At the conclusion of his assignment in 
Rome, Ames received instructions from the 
KGB regarding clandestine contacts in the 
Washington, D.C., area, where he would next 
be assigned. In the four years after he volun-
teered, the KGB paid Ames $1.88 million.
Upon his return to Washington, D.C., in 
1989, Ames continued to pass classified 
documents to the KGB, using “dead drops” 
or prearranged hiding places where he 
would leave the documents to be picked up 
later by KGB officers from the USSR Em-
bassy in Washington. In return, the KGB left 
money and instructions for Ames, usually in 
other “dead drops.”
In the meantime, the CIA and FBI 
learned that Russian officials who had been 
recruited by them were being arrested and 
executed. These human sources had pro-
vided critical intelligence information about 
the USSR, which was used by U.S. policy 
makers in determining U.S. foreign policy. 
Following analytical reviews and receipt 
of information about Ames’s unexplained 
wealth, the FBI opened an investigation in 
May 1993.
FBI special agents and investigative spe-
cialists conducted intensive physical and 
electronic surveillance of Ames during a 
10-month investigation. Searches of Ames’s 
residence revealed documents and other 
information linking Ames to the Russian 
foreign intelligence service. On October 13, 
1993, investigative specialists observed a 
chalk mark Ames made on a mailbox con-
firming to the Russians his intention to meet 
them in Bogota, Colombia. On November 
1, special agents observed him and, sepa-
rately, his Russian handler in Bogota. When 
Ames planned foreign travel, including a 
trip to Moscow, as part of his official duties, 
a plan to arrest him was approved.
Following guilty pleas by both Ames and 
his wife on April 28, 1994, Ames was sen-
tenced to incarceration for life without the 
possibility of parole. Rosario Ames was sen-
tenced on October 20, 1994, to 63 months 
in prison. Ames also forfeited his assets 
to the United States, and $547,000 was 
turned over to the Justice Department’s 
Victims Assistance Fund. Ames is serving 
his sentence in the federal prison system. 
Rosario Ames completed her sentence and 
was released.

Aldrich Hazen Ames
Aldrich Hazen Ames was arrested by the 
FBI in Arlington, Virginia, on espionage 
charges on February 24, 1994. At the time 
of his arrest, Ames was a 31-year veteran of 
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who 
had been spying for the Russians since 
1985. Arrested with him was his wife, Ro-
sario Ames, who had aided and abetted his 
espionage activities.
Ames was a CIA case officer, who spoke 
Russian and specialized in the Russian in-
telligence services, including the KGB, the 
USSR’s foreign intelligence service. His 
initial overseas assignment was in Ankara, 
Turkey, where he targeted Russian intel-
ligence officers for recruitment. Later, he 
worked in New York City and Mexico City.

arose they jumped on the chance in order to satisfy their de-
sire for profi ts, for academic or scientifi c acclaim, or out of a 
sense of patriotism to their home countries.
A number of factors have combined to facilitate private-
sector technology theft. Globalization, while generating 
major gains for the U.S. economy, has given foreigners un-
precedented access to U.S. fi rms and to sensitive technolo-
gies. There has also been a proliferation of devices that have 
made it easy for private-sector experts to illegally retrieve, 
store, and transfer massive amounts of information, includ-
ing trade secrets and proprietary data; such devices are in-
creasingly common in the workplace.
In addition to private citizens conducting espionage, 
foreign government organizations also mount their own op-
erations, including:
Targeting U.S. fi rms for technology that would 
 
■
strengthen their foreign defense capabilities
Posting personnel at U.S. military bases to collect classi-
 
■
fi ed information to bolster military modernization efforts
Employing commercial fi rms in the United States in a 
 
■
covert effort to target and acquire U.S. technology
Recruiting students, professors, scientists, and research-
 
■
ers to engage in technology collection
Making direct requests for classifi ed, sensitive, or ex-
 
■
port-controlled information
Forming ventures with U.S. fi rms in the hope of placing 
 
■
collectors in proximity to sensitive technologies or else 
establishing foreign research21
Legal Controls Until 1996, there was no federal statute 
that explicitly penalized industrial espionage. Recognizing 
the increasingly important role that intellectual property 
plays in the well-being of the American economy, Con-
gress enacted the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996, 
which criminalizes the theft of trade secrets. The EEA ac-
tually contains two separate provisions, one that penalizes 
foreign agents from stealing American trade secrets and one 
directed at domestic spying. Some of the key provisions of 
the EEA are set out in Exhibit 11.3.
Convictions of foreign agents under the Economic Espi-
onage Act have been relatively rare. On December 14, 2006, 
Fei Ye and Ming Zhong pleaded guilty to two counts each 
of economic espionage. Ye and Zhong were arrested at the 
San Francisco International Airport on November 23, 2001, 
with stolen trade secret information from Sun Microsystems 
and Transmeta Corporation. At their hearing, Ye and Zhong 
admitted that they intended to utilize the trade secrets in 
designing a computer microprocessor that was to be manu-
factured and marketed by a company they had established, 
known as Supervision, Inc., and would have profi ted from 
sales of chips to the city of Hangzhou and the province of 
Zhejiang in China; their company had applied for funding 
from the National High Technology Research and Develop-
ment Program of China. The plea resulted in the fi rst con-
viction of foreign agents under the Economic Espionage Act 
more than 10 years after it was enacted into law.22
for society. After graduation, they secured sensitive govern-
ment posts that gave them access to valuable intelligence 
they then passed on to the Soviet Union. Two of the con-
spirators, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, were exposed 
in 1951 and defected to the Soviet Union before they could 
be captured; Kim Philby, who had worked as a high-level 
intelligence agent, defected to Russia in 1963 but not before 
passing on information that cost hundreds of lives. The last 
two members of the ring, Anthony Blunt and John Cairn-
cross, went undetected for many years.17
While some spies, like the Cambridge Five, are moti-
vated by ideology, others, like FBI agent Robert Hanssen and 
CIA operative Harold Nicholson, were looking for profi t. In 
1997, Nicholson was convicted of selling U.S. intelligence 
to Russia for $180,000 and was sentenced to 23.5 years im-
prisonment; Nicholson was the highest ranking CIA offi cial 
ever convicted for spying for a foreign country. Hanssen 
sold American secrets to Russia for more than $1.4 million 
in cash and diamonds over a 22-year period; he is currently 
serving a life sentence.18
Government employees in a position of trust may offer 
to misappropriate state secrets for a payoff from a foreign 
government. One of the most infamous of these cases, that 
of CIA double agent Aldrich Ames, is set out in the Profi les 
in Crime feature.
Industrial Espionage The concept of espionage has been 
extended to spying involving corporations, referred to as 
industrial espionage. This involves such unethical or illegal 
activities as bribing employees to reveal trade secrets such 
as computer codes or product formulas. The traditional 
methods of industrial espionage include recruiting agents 
and inserting them into the target company or breaking into 
an offi ce to take equipment and information. It can also in-
volve surveillance and spying on commercial organizations 
in order to determine the direction of their new product 
line or even what bid they intend to make on a government 
contract. Such knowledge can provide vast profi ts when it 
allows a competitor to save large sums on product develop-
ment or to win an undeserved contract by underbidding.19
Foreign Industrial Espionage Not all corporate espionage 
is home grown, and some attacks have been carried out by 
foreign agents. A report of the National Counterintelligence 
Center lists biotechnology, aerospace, telecommunications, 
computer software, transportation, advanced materials, en-
ergy research, defense, and semiconductor companies as the 
top targets for foreign economic espionage.20
Industrial espionage by foreign agents’ efforts have hurt 
the United States by eroding the U.S. military advantage by 
enabling foreign militaries to acquire sophisticated capabili-
ties that might otherwise have taken years to develop. Such 
efforts also undercut the U.S. economy by making it pos-
sible for foreign fi rms to gain a competitive economic edge 
over U.S. companies.
Many foreign agents did not come to the United States 
specifi cally to engage in espionage, but when an opportunity

382  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
State Political Crime
While some political crimes are committed by people who 
oppose the state, others are perpetrated by state authori-
ties against the people they are supposed to serve; this is 
referred to as state political crime.  Critical criminologists 
argue that rather than being committed by disaffected peo-
ple, a great deal of political crime arises from the efforts of 
the state to either maintain governmental power or to up-
hold the race, class, and gender advantages of those who 
support the government. In industrial society, the state will 
do everything to protect the property rights of the wealthy 
while opposing the real interests of the poor. They might 
even go to war to support the capitalist classes who need the 
wealth and resources of other nations. The desire for natural 
resources such as rubber, oil, and metals was one of the pri-
mary reasons for Japan’s invasion of China and other East-
ern nations that sparked their entry into World War II. 
Using Torture
On February 23, 2007, Osama Hassan Mustafa Nasr, an 
Egyptian cleric, made worldwide headlines when he claimed 
that he had been kidnapped in Italy by American CIA agents 
and sent to Egypt for interrogation as part of the CIA’s “ex-
traordinary rendition.” Nasr claimed, “I was subjected to the 
worst kind of torture in Egyptian prisons. I have scars of 
torture all over my body.” Italy indicted 26 Americans and 
fi ve Italian agents accused of seizing him and sending him 
to Egypt without trial or due process.23
Of all state political crimes, the use of torture to gain 
information from suspected political criminals is perhaps 
the most notorious. Can the torture of a suspected terrorist 
determined to destroy the government and harm innocent 
civilians ever be permissible or is it always an example of 
state-sponsored political crime? While most people loathe 
the thought of torturing anyone, some experts argue that 
torture can sometimes be justifi ed in what they call the tick-
ing bomb scenario: suppose the government found out that 
a captured terrorist knew the whereabouts of a dangerous 
explosive device that was set to go off and kill thousands 
of innocent people. Would it be permissible to engage in 
the use of torture on this single suspect if it would save the 
population of a city? While the ticking bomb scenario has 
appeal (see The Criminological Enterprise feature “Want to 
Torture? Get a Warrant”), opponents of torture believe that 
even imminent danger does not justify state violence. There 
is a danger that such state-sponsored violence would become 
calculated and premeditated; torturers would have to be 
trained, ready, and in place for the ticking bomb argument 
to work. We couldn’t be running around looking for tortur-
ers with a bomb set to go off, could we? Because torturers 
would be part of the government bureaucracy, there is no 
way to ensure that they would only use their skills in cer-
tain morally justifi able cases.24 What happens if a superior

CHAPTER 11 | Political Crime and Terrorism  383
Critics have complained that government agencies such 
as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have used torture 
without legal authority. Despite its illegality, enemy agents 
have been detained and physically abused in secret prisons 
around the world without the benefi t of due process. In some 
cases, suspects have been held in foreign countries simply 
because their governments are not squeamish about using 
torture during interrogations. Shocking photo evidence of 
offi cer tells them to torture someone, but they believe the or-
der is unjustifi ed? Should they follow orders or risk a court-
martial for being disobedient? Furthermore, there is very 
little empirical evidence suggesting that torture provides 
any real benefi ts and much more that suggests it can create 
 serious problems. It can damage civil rights and democratic 
institutions and cause the general public to have sympathy 
for the victims of torture no matter their evil intent.25
has employed torture outside of the law. It 
is routine for police officers to put tremen-
dous pressure on suspects in order to get 
them to talk. The “third degree” is all too 
common, not only on TV shows, but in the 
back rooms of real police station houses. If 
it is already used, would it not be better to 
have it regulated and controlled by the rule 
of law? If it isn’t, law enforcement agents 
would continue to use torture anyway, only 
it would fall “below the radar screen of ac-
countability.” Which would be more consis-
tent with democratic values?
Dershowitz recognizes that those op-
posed to the idea of a torture warrant argue 
that establishing such a precedent would 
legitimize torture and make it easier to use 
under any circumstances. But he believes 
that the opposite would be true: by expressly 
limiting the use of torture only to the ticking 
bomb case and by requiring an objective 
and reasoned judge to approve, limit, and 
monitor the torture, it will be far more dif-
ficult to justify its extension to other institu-
tions. The goal of the warrant would be to 
reduce and limit the amount of torture that 
would, in fact, be used in an emergency.
Not everyone agrees that in some ex-
treme cases the “ends justify the means.” 
Human Rights Watch, an international 
group dedicated to protecting the human 
rights of people around the world, coun-
ters Dershowitz by pointing out that while 
the ticking bomb scenario makes for great 
philosophical discussion, it rarely arises in 
real life. Except in movies and TV, interroga-
tors rarely learn that a suspect in custody 
knows of a particular, imminent terrorist 
bombing and that they have the knowledge 
to prevent a catastrophe. Intelligence is 
rarely, if ever, good enough to provide such 
specific advance warning. If terrorists knew 
their plan could be foiled by information 
provided by a prisoner, why would they 
not change the plan? While not practical, 
the ticking bomb scenario can be danger-
ous because it expands the use of torture 
to anyone who might have knowledge of 
unspecified future terrorist attacks: Why 
are only the victims of an imminent terror-
ist attack deserving of protection by torture? 
Why not also use torture to prevent a ter-
rorist attack tomorrow or next week or next 
year? And why stop with the alleged terror-
ists themselves? Why not also torture their 
families or associates—anyone who might 
provide life-saving information? The slope is 
very slippery, Human Rights Watch claims.
CRITICAL THINKING
You are a government agent holding a pris-
oner who has been arrested on suspicion of 
being a terrorist. You get a call stating that 
there is a credible threat that a bomb will go 
off in two hours unless it can be found and 
defused. The prisoner has knowledge of the 
bomb’s location. How would you get him to 
reveal the location? Would you consider us-
ing torture? Is there a better method?

Want to Torture? Get a Warrant
According to the ticking bomb scenario, 
torture can be justified in order to force a 
political criminal to reveal the location of 
an explosive device before it can go off and 
kill many people. While a number of legal 
and social scholars have debated whether 
torture can ever be justified in a moral soci-
ety no matter what the intent, famed social 
commentator and legal scholar Alan Der-
showitz disagrees. He argues that torture 
can be justified under some circumstances, 
especially to prevent damaging terror at-
tacks. Moreover, he believes that the “vast 
majority” of Americans would expect law 
enforcement agents to engage in time-hon-
ored methods of “loosening tongues” if the 
circumstances demanded it, even though 
international bodies such as the United Na-
tions forbid its use no matter how exigent 
the circumstances. To ensure that torture is 
not used capriciously, Dershowitz proposes 
the creation of a “torture warrant” that can 
only be issued by a judge in cases where 
(a) there is an absolute need to obtain im-
mediate information in order to save lives 
and (b) there is probable cause that the 
suspect has such information and is unwill-
ing to reveal it to law enforcement agents. 
The suspect would be given immunity from 
prosecution based on information elicited 
by the torture; it would only be to save lives. 
The warrant would limit the torture to non-
lethal means, such as sterile needles being 
inserted beneath the nails to cause excruci-
ating pain without endangering life.
While Dershowitz recognizes that it may 
sound both awful and absurd for a judge to 
be issuing a warrant to torture a suspect, in 
truth every democracy, including our own,

torture fi rsthand in a North Vietnamese prison camp, told 
the press, “All I can say is that it was used in the Spanish 
Inquisition, it was used in Pol Pot‘s genocide in Cambodia, 
and there are reports that it is being used against Buddhist 
monks today. They should know what it is. It is not a com-
plicated procedure. It is torture.”28
TERRORISM
The political crime that many people are most concerned 
with is terrorism, and the remainder of this chapter focuses 
on the history, nature, and extent of terrorism and the meth-
ods being employed for its control. Despite its long history, it 
is often diffi cult to precisely defi ne terrorism (from the Latin 
terrere, which means to frighten) and to separate terrorist 
acts from interpersonal crimes of violence. For example, if 
a group robs a bank to obtain funds for its revolutionary 
struggles, should the act be treated as terrorism or as a com-
mon bank robbery? In this instance, defi ning a crime as ter-
rorism depends on the kind of legal response the act evokes 
from those in power. To be considered terrorism, which is 
a political crime, an act must carry with it the intent to dis-
rupt and change the government and must not be merely a 
common-law crime committed for greed or egotism.
Because of its complexity, an all-encompassing defi nition 
of terrorism is diffi cult to formulate, although most experts 
agree that it generally involves the illegal use of force against 
innocent people to achieve a political objective. According 
to the U.S. State Department, the term terrorism means pre-
meditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against 
torture from detention facilities at the Guantanamo base 
in Cuba support these charges. Legal scholars have argued 
that these tactics violate both international treaties and do-
mestic statutes prohibiting torture. Some maintain that the 
U.S. Constitution limits the authority of an executive agency 
like the CIA to act against foreigners abroad and also lim-
its physical coercion by the government under the Fifth 
Amendment due process and self-incrimination clauses and 
the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and un-
usual punishments. Legally, it is impermissible for United 
States authorities to engage in indefi nite detention or torture 
regardless of the end, the place, or the victim.26
The Waterboarding Controversy Can a bright line be 
drawn between what is considered torture and what consti-
tutes fi rm but legal interrogation methods? This issue made 
headlines when it was revealed in 2007 that the CIA made 
routine use of the waterboarding technique while interro-
gating suspected terrorists.27 Waterboarding involves immo-
bilizing a person on his or her back, with the head inclined 
downward, and pouring water over the face and into the 
breathing passages. It produces an immediate gag refl ex and 
an experience akin to drowning; the subject believes his or 
her death is imminent.
The use of waterboarding is controversial because there 
seems to be no agreement on whether it is torture or a rela-
tively harmless instrument of interrogation. While offi cial 
U.S. government policy and government doctrine is vehe-
mently opposed to torture, it has condoned harsh interro-
gation techniques that combine physical and psychological 
tactics, including head slapping, waterboarding, and expo-
sure to extreme cold. Waterboarding even became an issue 
during the 2008 presidential campaign when Senator John
McCain, a former prisoner of war who had experienced 
As a criminologist, your specialty is terrorism, so 
it comes as no surprise that the director of the 
CIA asks you to draw up a protocol setting out 
the rules for the use of torture with suspected 
terrorists. The reason for his request is that a 
series of new articles has exposed the agency’s 
practice of sending suspected terrorists to 
friendly nations that are less squeamish about 
using torture. He understands that the Ameri-
can public has mixed feelings about torture. A 2009 
Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 49 percent of respon-
dents agreed that the United States should not torture, while 48 
percent believed torture is sometimes acceptable. A recent Gallup 
poll found that 55 percent of Americans be-
lieve that the use of harsh interrogation tech-
niques is justified, while only 36 percent say 
they are not.
❯❯ Write a memo to the CIA director outlin-
ing the protocol you recommend for the use of 
torture with suspected terrorists. In your docu-
ment, address when torture should be used, 
who it should be used on, and what tortures 
you recommend using. Of course, if you believe the use of tor-
ture is always unethical, you could let the director know why you 
have reached this conclusion.

CHAPTER 11 | Political Crime and Terrorism  385
noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine 
agents, usually intended to infl uence an audience. The term 
international terrorism means terrorism involving citizens or 
the territory of more than one country. A terrorist group is 
any group practicing, or that has signifi cant subgroups that 
practice, international terrorism.29 Exhibit 11.4 sets out a 
number of defi nitions of terrorism drafted or used by prom-
inent governmental agencies or organizations.
Terrorism usually involves a type of political crime that 
emphasizes violence as a mechanism to promote change. 
Whereas some political criminals sell secrets, spy, and the 
like, terrorists systematically murder and destroy or threaten 
such violence to terrorize individuals, groups, communi-
ties, or governments into conceding to the terrorists’ po-
litical demands.30 Because terrorists lacks large armies and 
formidable weapons, their use of subterfuge, secrecy, and 
hit-and-run tactics is designed to give them a psychological 
advantage and the power to neutralize the physical superi-
ority of their opponents.
However, it may be erroneous to assume that terror-
ists have political goals. Some may try to bring about what 
they consider to be social reform—for example, by attack-
ing women wearing fur coats or sabotaging property during 
a labor dispute. Terrorism must also be distinguished from 
conventional warfare, because it requires secrecy and clan-
destine operations to exert social control over large popula-
tions.31 So terrorist activities may be aimed at promoting an 
ideology other than political change.
Terror Cells Regardless of what organizational structure is 
used, most groups subdivide their affi liates into terror cells 
for both organizational and security purposes. To enhance 
security, each cell may be functionally independent so that 
each member has little knowledge of other cells, their mem-
bers, locations, and so on. However, individual cell mem-
bers provide emotional support to one another and maintain 
loyalty and dedication. Because only the cell leader knows 
how to communicate with other cells and/or a central com-
mand, capture of one cell does not then compromise other 
group members.
Terror cell formations may be based on location, em-
ployment, or family membership. Some are formed on 
the basis of function: some are fi ghters, others political 
organizers. The number of cells and their composition de-
pend on the size of the terrorist group: local or national 
groups will have fewer cells than international terrorist 
groups that may operate in several countries, such as the 
al-Qaeda group.
Terrorist and Guerilla
The word terrorist is often used interchangeably with the 
word guerilla, but the terms are quite different. Guerilla 
comes from the Spanish term meaning “little war,” which 
developed out of the Spanish rebellion against French

Definitions of Terrorism
League of Nations Convention (1937)
  All criminal acts directed against a State and intended 
or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of 
particular persons or a group of persons or the general 
public.
United Nations Resolution Language (1999)
 1.  Strongly condemns all acts, methods and practices of 
terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, wherever and by 
whomsoever committed;
 2.  Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to pro-
voke a state of terror in the general public, a group of per-
sons or particular persons for political purposes are in any 
circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations 
of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, reli-
gious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them.

Terrorism.”)
Short Legal Definition Proposed by A. P. Schmid to United 
Nations Crime Branch (1992)
  Act of Terrorism = Peacetime Equivalent of War Crime
Academic Consensus Definition Used by the United 
Nations
  Terrorism is an anxiety-inspiring method of repeated vio-
lent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual, 
group or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal or politi-
cal reasons, whereby—in contrast to assassination—the 
direct targets of violence are not the main targets. The im-
mediate human victims of violence are generally chosen 
randomly (targets of opportunity) or selectively (represen-
tative or symbolic targets) from a target population, and 
serve as message generators. Threat- and violence-based 
communication processes between terrorist (organization), 
(imperiled) victims, and main targets are used to manipu-
late the main target (audience[s]), turning it into a target 
of terror, a target of demands, or a target of attention, de-
pending on whether intimidation, coercion, or propaganda 
is primarily sought.
United States Department of State
  The term “terrorism” means premeditated, politically mo-
tivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets 
by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually in-
tended to influence an audience.
   The term “international terrorism” means terrorism in-
volving citizens or the territory of more than one country.
   The term “terrorist group” means any group practicing, 
or that has significant subgroups that practice, interna-
tional terrorism.

386  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Terrorist and Revolutionary
A revolution (from the Latin revolutio, “a revolving,” and 
revolvere, “turn, roll back”) is generally seen as a civil war 
fought between nationalists and a sovereign power that 
holds control of the land, or between the existing govern-
ment and local groups over issues of ideology and power. 
Historically, the American Revolution may be considered 
an example of a struggle between nationalistic groups and 
an imperialistic overseas government. Classic examples of 
ideological rebellions are the French Revolution, which pit-
ted the middle class and urban poor against the aristocracy, 
and the Russian Revolution of 1917, during which the Czar-
ist government was toppled by the Bolsheviks. More recent 
ideological revolutions have occurred in China, Cuba, Nica-
ragua, and Chile, to name but a few.
While some revolutions (such as the American, French, 
and Russian) rely on armed force, terror activities, and vio-
lence, others can be nonviolent, depending on large urban 
protests and threats. Such was the case when the Shah Mo-
hammad Reza Pahlavi was toppled in Iran in the 1979 revolu-
tion that transformed Iran into an Islamic republic under the 
rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Similar events unfolded 
in Egypt in early 2011 in the effort to topple the government 
of Hosni Mubarak that had been in power for 30 years.
Concept Summary 11.1 describes the components of 
the various types of political groups. 
A BRIEF HISTORY 
OF TERRORISM
Acts of terrorism have been known throughout history. The 
assassination of Julius Caesar on March 15, 44 BCE is con-
sidered an act of terrorism. Terrorism became widespread 
at the end of the Middle Ages, when political leaders were 
frequently subject to assassination by their enemies.
Religious Roots
The first terrorist activities were committed by members 
of minority religious groups who engaged in violence to 
(a) gain the right to practice their own form of religion, (b) 
establish the supremacy of their own religion over others, 
or (c) meet the requirements of the blood-thirsty gods they 
worshipped.36
In some instances, a conquered people used force and 
violence to maintain their right to worship in their own faith. 
Zealots, Hebrew warrior groups, were active during the Ro-
man occupation of Palestine during the first century CE. 
A subgroup of the Zealots, the Sciari (literally translated as 
“daggermen”), were so named after the long curved knives 
troops after Napoleon’s 1808 invasion of the Iberian Pen-
insula.32 Terrorists have an urban focus. Operating in 
small bands, or cadres, of three to fi ve members, they tar-
get the property or persons of their enemy, such as mem-
bers of the ruling class.33 However, terrorists may not 
have political ambitions, and their actions may be aimed 
at stifl ing or intimidating other groups who oppose their 
political, social, or economic views. For example, ter-
rorists who kill abortion providers in order to promote 
their “pro-life” agenda are not aiming for regime change. 
Guerillas, on the other hand, are armed military bands, 
typically located in rural areas, that attack military, po-
lice, and government offi cials in an effort to destabilize 
the existing government. Their organizations can grow 
quite large and eventually take the form of a conventional 
military force. Some guerilla bands infi ltrate urban areas 
(urban guerillas). For the most part, guerillas are a type 
of insurgent band.
Terrorist and Insurgent
As commonly used, an insurgency is somewhat differ-
ent from both guerilla warfare and terrorism. The typical 
goal of an insurgency is to confront the existing govern-
ment for control of all or a portion of its territory, or 
force political concessions in sharing political power by 
competing with the opposition government for popular 
support.34 Insurgents are organized into covert groups 
who engage in an organized campaign of extreme vio-
lence, which may falsely appear to be random and indis-
criminate, such causing the death of innocent civilians, 
but has a distinct political agenda. Insurgents tend to 
live isolated and stressful lives and enjoy varying levels 
of public support.35
While insurgents may engage in violence, they can also 
use nonviolent methods or political tactics. For example, 
they may set up food distribution centers and schools in 
areas in which they gain control in order to provide the 
population with needed services while contrasting their 
benevolent rule with the government’s incompetence and 
corruption.
When insurgents use violence, it is designed to in-
spire support and gain converts while at the same time 
destroying the government’s ability to resist. It is easy to 
recruit supporters once the population believes that the 
government is incapable of fi ghting back. On the other 
hand, some members of the insurgency might shun vio-
lence and eventually create nonviolent splinter groups. 
They can then operate openly, claiming to sympathize 
with the violent wing of their organization but just not 
being part of its structure. They may seek external sup-
port from other nations to bring pressure on the govern-
ment. A terror group, in contrast, neither requires nor 
has active support or sympathy from a large percentage 
of the population.

CHAPTER 11 | Political Crime and Terrorism  387
India, members of the Thugee cult (from which the modern 
term “thug” was derived) were devoted to Kali, the goddess of 
death and destruction. The thugs believed each murder pre-
vented Kali’s arrival for 1,000 years, thus sparing the nation 
from her death and destruction. The thugs traveled in gangs 
of up to 100 with each member having a defi ned role—some 
lured unwary travelers, while others strangled the chosen 
victim. The gang used secret argot and jargon, which only 
they could understand, and signs so that members could 
recognize each other even in the most remote parts of India. 
Cult members may have killed hundreds of thousands of 
victims over a 300-year span. They would attach themselves 
to travelers and when the opportunity arose, strangle them 
with a noose around their necks, steal their money, and bury 
their bodies. The killings were highly ritualistic and involved 
religious rites and prayers. By the mid-nineteenth century 
the British made it a policy to end Thugee activities, hanged 
nearly 4,000, and all but eradicated the cult. Thugees repre-
sented the last serious religion-inspired terrorist threat until 
the emergence of Islamic terrorism in the 1980s.
Political Roots
When rulers had absolute power, terrorist acts were viewed 
as one of the only means of gaining political rights. At times 
European states encouraged terrorist acts against their en-
emies. In the sixteenth century, Queen Elizabeth I em-
powered her naval leaders, including famed captains John 
they favored as a weapon to assassinate Romans or their 
sympathizers. The Zealots carried out their attacks in broad 
daylight, typically with witnesses around, in order to send a 
message that the Roman authorities and those Jews who col-
laborated with them would not be safe. Ironically, this tactic 
is still being used by contemporary terrorists. The Zealots and 
Sciari led the revolt in 66 CE against Roman occupation of the 
Holy Land, during which they occupied the fortress of Mas-
ada. Here they held out for more than seven months before 
engaging in mass suicide rather than surrender to the Roman 
legions. The revolt ended badly and the Romans destroyed 
the Jewish temple and sent the population into exile.
Some religious terrorists want to promote the supremacy 
of their own sect over a rival group. The (Shi’ite) Muslim Or-
der of the Assassins (assassin literally means “hashish-eater,” 
a reference to the commonly held belief that gang members 
engaged in acts of ritual intoxication and smoked hashish 
just prior to undertaking their missions) was active in Per-
sia, Syria, and Palestine from 1090 to 1272, killing a great 
number of their enemies, mainly Sunnis whom they consid-
ered apostates, but also Christians who were then the rul-
ers of the kingdom of Jerusalem.37 The Assassins also were 
prone to stabbing their victims in an effort to spread their 
vision of Islam, and carried out missions in public places on 
holy days in order to publicize their cause. Successful assas-
sinations guaranteed them a place in heaven.
Another form of religious terror is inspired by the re-
quirements of belief. Some religious beliefs have focused on 
violence, the gods demanding the death of nonbelievers. In

other Western nations. According to Kellogg, between 1920 
and 1923, Adolf Hitler was deeply infl uenced by the Auf-
bau (Reconstruction), the émigrés’ organization. Members 
of the Aufbau allied with the Nazis to overthrow the legiti-
mate German government and thwart German communists 
from seizing power. The White Russians deep-seated anti-
Semitism may have inspired Hitler to go public with his 
campaign to kill the European Jews, prompting both the 
Holocaust and the invasion of Russia, which spelled the 
eventual doom of Hitler and National Socialism.38
During World War II, resistance to the occupying Ger-
man troops was common throughout Europe. The Germans 
considered the resistors to be terrorists, but the rest of the 
world considers them heroes. Meanwhile, in Palestine, Jew-
ish terrorist groups—the Haganah, Irgun, and Stern Gang, 
whose leaders included Menachem Begin, who later became 
Israel’s prime minister—waged war against the British to 
force them to allow Jewish survivors of the Holocaust to set-
tle in their traditional homeland. Today, of course, many of 
these alleged terrorists are considered freedom fi ghters who 
laid down their lives for a just cause.
After the war, Arab nationalists felt that they had been 
betrayed. Believing they were promised postwar indepen-
dence, they were doubly disappointed—first when the 
French and British were given authority over their lands, 
and then especially when the British allowed Zionist immi-
gration into Palestine in keeping with a promise contained 
in the Balfour Declaration.
Since the end of World War II, terrorism has accelerated 
its development into a major component of contemporary 
confl ict. Primarily in use immediately after the war as a sub-
ordinate element of anticolonial insurgencies, it expanded 
beyond that role. In the service of various ideologies and 
aspirations, terrorism sometimes supplanted other forms of 
confl ict completely. It became a far-reaching weapon capa-
ble of effects no less global than the intercontinental bomber 
or missile. It has also proven to be a signifi cant tool of diplo-
macy and international power for states inclined to use it.
CONTEMPORARY FORMS 
OF TERRORISM
Today the term terrorism encompasses many different behav-
iors and goals. Some of the more common forms are briefl y 
described here.
Revolutionary Terrorists
Revolutionary terrorists use violence to frighten those in power 
and their supporters in order to replace the existing govern-
ment with a regime that holds acceptable political or religious 
Hawkins and Francis Drake, to attack the Spanish fl eet and 
take prizes. These privateers would have been considered 
pirates had they not operated with government approval. 
American privateers attacked the British during the Revo-
lutionary War and the War of 1812 and were considered 
heroes for their actions against the English navy.
The term terrorist first became popular during the 
French Revolution. Use of the word terrorism began in 1795 
in reference to the Reign of Terror initiated by the revolu-
tionary government during which agents of the Committee 
of Public Safety and the National Convention were referred 
to as terrorists. In response, royalists and opponents of the 
Revolution employed terrorist tactics in resistance to the 
Revolutionists. The widespread use of the guillotine is an in-
famous reminder of the revolutionary violence; urban mobs 
demanded blood, and many government offi cials and aris-
tocrats were beheaded in gruesome public spectacles. From 
the fall of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, until July 1794, 
thousands suspected of counterrevolutionary activity were 
killed on the guillotine. Here again, the relative nature of 
political crime is documented: most victims of the French 
Reign of Terror were revolutionaries who had been de-
nounced by rival factions, whereas thousands of the hated 
nobility lived in relative tranquility. The end of the terror 
was signaled by the death of its prime mover, Maximilien 
Robespierre, on July 28, 1794, as the result of a successful 
plot to end his rule. He was executed on the same guillotine 
to which he had sent almost 20,000 people.
In the hundred years following the French Revolution, 
terrorism continued to be a political tool around the world. 
Terrorist acts became the preferred method of political action 
for national groups in the early years of the twentieth century. 
In Eastern Europe, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization campaigned against the Turkish government, 
which controlled its homeland (Macedonia became part of 
the former Yugoslavia). Similarly, the protest of the Union of 
Death Society, or Black Hand, against the Austro-Hungarian 
Empire’s control of Serbia led to the group’s assassination of 
Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which started World War I. Rus-
sia was the scene of left-wing revolutionary activity, which 
killed the czar in 1917 and gave birth to the Marxist state.
After the war ended, the Treaty of Versailles restructured 
Europe and broke up the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The re-
sult was a hodgepodge of new nations controlled by majority 
ethnic groups. Self-determination was limited to European na-
tions and ethnic groups and denied to others, especially the 
colonial possessions of the major European powers, creating 
bitterness and setting the stage for the long confl icts of the 
anticolonial period. The Irish Republican Army, established 
around 1916, steadily battled British forces from 1919 to 1923, 
culminating in the Republic of Ireland gaining independence.
Between the World Wars, right-wing terrorism existed in 
Germany, Spain, and Italy. One source of tension, according 
to author Michael Kellogg, was the virulently anti-Commu-
nist exiles who fl ed Russia after the 1917 Revolution (called 
White Russians) and took up residence in Germany and

On the right, they tend to be heavily armed groups orga-
nized around such themes as white supremacy, anti-abortion, 
militant tax resistance, and religious revisionism. Identifi ed 
groups have included, at one time or another, the Aryan Re-
publican Army, the Aryan Nation, the Posse Comitatus, and 
the Ku Klux Klan. These groups want to shape U.S. govern-
ment policy over a range of matters, including ending abor-
tion rights, extending the right to bear arms, and eliminating 
federal taxation. Anti-abortion groups have demonstrated at 
abortion clinics, attacked clients, bombed offi ces, and killed 
doctors who perform abortions. On October 23, 1998, Dr. 
Barnett Slepian was shot by a sniper and killed in his Buf-
falo, New York, home; he was one of a growing number of 
abortion providers believed to be the victims of terrorists who 
ironically claim to be “pro-life.” Although unlikely to topple 
the government, these individualistic acts of terror are dif-
fi cult to predict or control. On April 19, 1995, 168 people 
were killed during the Oklahoma City bombing, the most se-
vere example of political terrorism in the United States so far.
Left-Wing Political Groups During the turmoil of the 
1960s, a number of left-wing political groups emerged to 
challenge the existing power structure. Some, such as the 
views. Terrorist actions such as kidnapping, assassination, and 
bombing are designed to draw repressive responses from gov-
ernments trying to defend themselves. These responses help 
revolutionaries to expose, through the skilled use of media 
coverage, the government’s inhumane nature. The original rea-
son for the government’s harsh response may be lost as the ef-
fect of counterterrorist activities is felt by uninvolved people.
Jemaah Islamiyah, an Indonesian terrorist organization 
aligned with al-Qaeda, is believed to be intent on driving away 
foreign tourists and ruining the nation’s economy so they can 
usurp the government and set up a pan-Islamic nation in In-
donesia and neighboring Malaysia (see Exhibit 11.5).39
Political Terrorists
Political terrorism is directed at people or groups who op-
pose the terrorists’ political ideology or whom the terrorists 
defi ne as “outsiders” who must be destroyed. Political ter-
rorists may not want to replace the existing government but 
to shape it so that it accepts the terrorists’ views.
Right-Wing Political Groups Domestic terrorists in the 
United States can be found across the political spectrum. 
EXHIBIT 11.5 
Jemaah Islamiyah
Jemaah Islamiyah is a militant Islamic organization located in 
Southeast Asia devoted to the establishment of fundamentalist 
Islamic states in countries such as Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, 
Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. The name derives from 
an Arabic phrase meaning “Islamic group” or “Islamic commu-
nity.” The group has its roots in the Darul Islam organization, a 
violent radical group that advocated the establishment of Islamic 
law in Indonesia in the 1940s and 1950s as a reaction to Dutch 
colonial rule and what it perceived as the secular orientation of 
postcolonial Indonesia.
Jemaah Islamiyah sponsors recruiting, training, indoctrina-
tion, and financial support for terror groups in the region and 
helps link them to kindred organizations such as al-Qaeda, the 
Abu Sayyaf Group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the Misuari 
Renegade/Breakaway Group, and the Philippine Raja Solaiman 
Movement. Jemaah Islamiyah members have been sent to Af-
ghanistan and southern Philippines for military training where 
they learned bomb-making and other terror skills.
Jemaah Islamiyah operates through cells with a rather loosely 
organized structure. The top strategists appear to be mostly In-
donesian nationals living in Malaysia, many of whom had gone 
to Afghanistan to fight the Russians during the Soviet occupation 
in the 1980s. The second level is made up of field coordinators, 
responsible for delivering money and explosives and for choos-
ing a local subordinate who can effectively act as team leader of 
the foot soldiers. At the bottom of the organization are the sol-
diers who drive the cars, survey targets, and deliver the bombs. 
They are mostly young men from pesantrens (religious boarding 
schools) or Islamic high schools run by teachers who were in-
volved in the Darul Islam rebellions of the 1950s.
Jemaah Islamiyah has been responsible for numerous at-
tacks that have killed hundreds of civilians in the region. The 
Bali car bombing on October 12, 2002, in which 202 people 
died, was a coordinated attack designed to destroy the tourist 
industry, a significant source of income for the government. A 
suicide bomber using a backpack bomb killed several people in 
a nightclub frequented by foreign tourists. The survivors ran into 
the street and were killed by a fertilizer/fuel oil bomb concealed 
in a parked van. Other attacks linked to Jemaah Islamiyah are 
the 2003 JW Marriott hotel bombing in Kuningan, Jakarta, the 
2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta, and the 2005 Bali 
terrorist bombing.
Authorities in the region attempted to crack down on the 
group after the 2002 bombing, arresting more than 200 mem-
bers. Three of the four main suspects behind the attack were 
sentenced to death in Indonesia.

Another group, the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) fo-
cuses their efforts on protecting animals from being used as 
food, in clothing, or as experimental subjects. Their philoso-
phy is that animals are entitled to the moral right to possess 
their own lives and control their own bodies, while rejecting 
the view that animals are merely capital goods or property in-
tended for the benefi t of humans and can be bought, sold, or 
killed by humans. ALF members conduct actions against sci-
entists who conduct animal research, vandalizing their homes 
and cars, attacking labs, and setting animals free. They also 
conduct actions against animal breeding farms and food pro-
cessing plants. ALF members have raided turkey farms before 
Thanksgiving and rabbit farms before Easter. Their activities 
have had signifi cant impact on the commercial aspects of sci-
entifi c testing, driving up the price of products, such as drugs, 
which rely on animal experimentation.43 The ALF position on 
raising animals in breeding ranches is set out in Exhibit 11.6.
Not surprisingly, the FBI and other law enforcement 
agencies have targeted eco-terror groups such as ELF and 
ALF. On January 20, 2006, the FBI announced that its Op-
eration Backfi re had led to the arrest of 11 people who were 
accused of 17 attacks, including the $12 million arson of the 
Vail Ski Resort in 1998 and the sabotage of a high-tension 
power line near Bend, Oregon, in 1999.44
Nationalist Terrorism
Nationalist terrorism promotes the interests of a minority 
ethnic or religious group that believes it has been perse-
cuted under majority rule and wishes to carve out its own 
independent homeland.
In Spain, the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (Euzkadi 
Ta Askatasuna, or ETA) is devoted to establishing a Basque 
homeland based on Marxist principles in the ethnically 
Basque areas in northern Spain and southwestern France. 
ETA was founded in 1959 by Basque Marxist rebels in-
censed by the efforts of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco 
to suppress the Basque language and culture. Since then the 
group has carried out numerous attacks in Spain and some 
in France. More than 800 people have been killed in ETA 
attacks since its founding. The group is best known for as-
sassinating high-level Spanish offi cials. In 1973, the group 
assassinated Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, the heir-apparent 
to Franco. Spanish King Juan Carlos was also the target of 
Black Panther Party—founded in 1966 in Oakland, Califor-
nia, by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton—demanded the right 
to control community schools, police, and public assistance 
programs. While many of their activities were productive, 
such as sponsoring breakfast programs and medical clinics 
in poor neighborhoods, they also began to openly carry ri-
fl es and shotguns while patrolling areas where the Oakland 
police were rumored to be harassing the community’s black 
citizens. The Panthers’ confrontational style led to clashes 
with police, shootings, and arrests. Because its leaders were 
faced with criminal charges of varying degrees, the Black 
Panthers steadily eroded.
Another infl uential 1960s group, the Students for a Dem-
ocratic Society (SDS) was founded in Chicago in 1962 and 
was active on college campuses throughout the sixties pro-
testing the United States’ involvement in Vietnam. Though 
the SDS was nonviolent, a splinter group known as the 
Weathermen utilized terror tactics to achieve their goals. They 
were involved in a number of bombings at corporation head-
quarters and federal institutions, though they typically sent 
out warnings to evacuate the buildings. The group lost infl u-
ence when on March 6, 1970, a bomb accidentally exploded 
in one of their safe houses in New York City. The detonations 
were so powerful that they collapsed the three-story house, 
killing three members. The Weathermen disbanded in 1977.
Eco-Terrorism The most active left-leaning domestic po-
litical terror groups today are involved in violent actions to 
protect the environment. Of these groups, the Earth Libera-
tion Front (ELF) is perhaps the best known. Founded in 
1994 in Brighton, England, by members of the Earth First! 
environmental movement, ELF has been active for several 
years in the United States and abroad. Operating in secret, 
ELF cells have conducted a series of actions intent on dam-
aging individuals or corporations that they consider a threat 
to the environment. On October 19, 1998, ELF members 
claimed responsibility for fi res that were set atop Vail Moun-
tain, a luxurious ski resort in Colorado, claiming that the 
action was designed to stop the resort from expanding into 
animal habitats (especially that of the mountain lynx); the 
fi res caused an estimated $12 million in damages. On Au-
gust 22, 2003, members of ELF claimed responsibility for 
fi res that destroyed about a dozen sport utility vehicles at 
a Chevrolet dealership in West Covina, California.40 Fires 
have also been set in government labs where animal re-
search is conducted. Spikes have been driven into trees to 
prevent logging in fragile areas. Members have conducted 
arson attacks on property ranging from a Nike shop in a 
mall north of Minneapolis to new homes on Long Island, 
New York. On February 7, 2004, ELF group members tar-
geted construction equipment at a 30-acre development 
site in Charlottesville, Virginia.41 On March 2, 2008, ELF 
is believed to have burnt a row of luxury homes in Seattle, 
causing $7 million in damage. While the multimillion dol-
lar homes used green technology such as formaldehyde-free 
materials, energy-effi cient appliances, and landscaping that

strations, bombings, and political assassinations.45 In Rus-

an unsuccessful plot. In addition, the group has targeted 
lower-level offi cials, journalists, and businessmen.
In the Middle East, terrorist activities have been linked to 
the Palestinians’ desire to wrest their former homeland from 
Israel. At fi rst, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), 
led by Yassir Arafat, directed terrorist activities against Israel. 
Now the group Hamas is perpetuating the confl ict with Israel 
and is behind a spate of suicide bombings and terrorist at-
tacks designed to elicit a sharp response from Israel and set 
back any chance for peace in the region. Hundreds on both 
sides of the confl ict have been killed during terrorist attacks 
and reprisals. In Lebanon, Hezbollah, an Iranian-supported 
group, is dedicated to fi ghting Israel and seizing control of the 
government. Their activities are described in Exhibit 11.7.
The Middle East is not the only source of nationalis-
tic terrorism. The Chinese government has been trying to 
suppress separatist groups fighting for an independent 
state in the northwestern province of Xinjiang. The rebels 
are drawn from the region’s Uyghur people, most of whom 
practice Sufi  Islam, speak a Turkic language, and wish to 
EXHIBIT 11.6 
Breeding Ranches and Animal Liberation
A common misconception about fur “ranches” is that the 
animals do not suffer. This is entirely untrue. These animals 
suffer a life of misery and frustration, deprived of their most 
basic needs. They are kept in wire-mesh cages that are tiny, 
overcrowded, and filthy. Here they are malnourished, suffer 
contagious diseases, and endure severe stress.
On these farms, the animals are forced to forfeit their 
natural instincts. Beavers, who live in water in the wild, must 
exist on cement floors. Minks in the wild, too, spend much of 
their time in water, which keeps their salivation, respiration, 
and body temperature stable. They are also, by nature, soli-
tary animals. However, on these farms, they are forced to live 
in close contact with other animals. This often leads to self-
destructive behavior, such as pelt and tail biting. They often 
resort to cannibalism.
The methods used on these farms reflect not the interests 
and welfare of the animals but the furriers’ primary interest—
profit. The end of the suffering of these animals comes only 
with death, which, in order to preserve the quality of the fur, 
is inflicted with extreme cruelty and brutality. Engine exhaust 
is often pumped into a box of animals. This exhaust is not al-
ways lethal, and the animals sometimes writhe in pain as they 
are skinned alive. Another common execution practice, often 
used on larger animals, is anal electrocution. The farmers at-
tach clamps to an animal’s lips and insert metal rods into its 
anus. The animal is then electrocuted. Decompression cham-
bers, neck snapping, and poison are also used.

Hezbollah
Hezbollah (from the Arabic, meaning “party of God“) is a Leba-
nese Shi’ite Islamist organization founded in 1982 in response to 
the presence of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. At inception, 
its goals were to both drive Israeli troops out of Lebanon and to 
form a Shi’ite Islamic republic in Lebanon. Taking its inspiration 
from Iran, Hezbollah members follow a distinct version of Shia 
ideology developed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of 
the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Hezbollah has received arms and 
financial support from Iran, and some observers believe that it is 
actually a proxy Iranian paramilitary force. Hezbollah is anti-West 
and anti-Israel and has engaged in a series of terrorist actions 
including kidnappings, car bombings, and airline hijackings. 
Some of its most notable attacks directed at U.S. citizens and 
others include:
The suicide truck bombings that killed more than 200 U.S. 
 
■
Marines at their barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983
The 1985 hijacking of TWA flight 847
 
■
Two major 1990s attacks in Argentina—the 1992 bombing 
 
■
of the Israeli Embassy (killing 29) and the 1994 bombing of 
a Jewish community center (killing 95)
A July 2006 raid on a border post in northern Israel in 
 
■
which two Israeli soldiers were taken captive, an action 
that sparked an Israeli military incursion into Lebanon 
and the firing of rockets by Hezbollah across the 
Lebanese border into Israel
In addition to its military/terror campaigns, Hezbollah has 
attempted to win the hearts and minds of the Lebanese Shi’ite 
community by providing social services and food to the popu-
lation. It has also entered the political world, and its candi-
dates have won seats in Lebanon’s parliament.
The public face of Hezbollah is Hassan Nasrallah, the 
group’s senior political leader. Originally a military com-
mander, Nasrallah’s military and religious training makes him 
a unique leader. His leadership of Hezbollah’s resistance to 
the Israeli army in the summer of 2006 made him one of the 
most popular leaders in the Middle East. For over 20 years, 
Imad Fayez Mugniyah was considered the key planner of Hez-
bollah’s worldwide terrorist operations. On February 13, 2008, 
Mugniyah was killed in a car bombing in Damascus. Hezbol-
lah officials accused Israel of launching the attacks that killed 
him, but the Israeli government denied involvement.

Victims are usually selected for their maximum propa-
 
■
ganda value, usually ensuring a high degree of media 
coverage. The message is that the target population 
had better comply with their demands because the 
terrorists are desperate enough to “do anything.” 
Sometimes this may backfi re if the attack results in the 
death of innocents, especially children, along with the 
symbolic targets.
Unconventional military tactics are used, especially se-

crecy and surprise, as well as targeting civilians, includ-
ing women and children. Because the goal is to infl ict 
maximum horror, it makes sense to choose targets that 
contain the largest number of victims from all walks of

Retributive Terrorism
Some terrorist groups are not nationalist, political, or revo-
lutionary organizations. They do not wish to set up their 
own homeland or topple a government but rather want to 
impose their social and religious code on others.46 Retrib-
utive terrorists have a number of characteristics that are 
unique and separate them from guerrillas, revolutionaries, 
and other terrorists:47
Violence is used as a method of infl uence, persuasion, 
 
■
or intimidation. The true target of the terrorist act ex-
tends far beyond those directly affected by the attack 
and is designed to lead to some desired behavior on the 
part of the larger target population or government.
and claimed that the terrorists were radical 
Muslims at war with the liberal religions of 
the West. Another view was that Osama’s 
rage was fueled by deep-rooted psychologi-
cal problems.
Usamah bin Muhammad bin Awad bin 
Ladin was born in 1957 or 1958 in Riyadh, 
Saudi Arabia. He was the seventh son in a 
family of 52 children. His father, Sheik Mo-
hammed Awad bin Laden, was a poor, un-
educated laborer from Hadramout in South 
Yemen who worked as a lowly porter in Jed-
dah. In 1930, the elder bin Laden started 
his own construction business, which be-
came so successful that his family grew 
to be known as “the wealthiest non-royal 
family in the kingdom.” Despite his royal 
associations and great wealth, Mohammed 
bin Laden remained a humble and devoted 
Muslim who insisted that his children ob-
serve a strict religious and moral code. He 
went to great pains to teach his children to 
take charge of their own lives and maintain 
their independence. In 1968, this training 
came into play in a brutal way when Mo-
hammed was killed in a plane crash near 
San Antonio, Texas, leaving his sons in 
charge, not only of the family business, but 
of their own destinies. Following his death, 
Mohammed bin Laden’s eldest sons contin-
ued to expand their late father’s company 
until it employed more than 40,000 people. 
The bin Laden group also expanded into 
Egypt, where it is now that country’s largest 
foreign private group.
Osama went on to complete his primary 
and secondary schooling and joined the 
Muslim Brotherhood. During this period he 
expanded his compulsory Islamic studies 
through a series of meetings that were con-
ducted at the family home by his elder broth-
ers. Among the contacts he made at these 
meetings were notable Islamic scholars and 
the leaders of various Muslim movements. 
Later, he attended King Abdul-Aziz University 
in Jeddah and completed degrees in pub-
lic administration and economics. When he 
wasn’t studying, the affluence of his family al-
lowed him to broaden his knowledge through 
travel to other countries, including Syria, 
Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Sudan.
In a 1995 interview with a French jour-
nalist, bin Laden explained why he chose to 
join the mujahideen fight against the Rus-
sians at that time:
To counter these atheist Russians, 
the Saudis chose me as their rep-
resentative in Afghanistan. . . . 
I did not fight against the com-
munist threat while forgetting the 
peril from the West. For us, the 
idea was not to get involved more 
than necessary in the fight against 
the Russians, which was the busi-
ness of the Americans, but rather 
Osama bin Laden
In the aftermath of the September 11, 
2001, destruction of the World Trade Cen-
ter in New York City, many Americans 
asked themselves the same simple ques-
tion: Why? What could motivate someone 
like Osama bin Laden to order the deaths of 
thousands of innocent people? How could 
someone who had never been to the United 
States or suffered personally at its hands 
develop such lethal hatred?
Some experts believed the attacks had a 
political basis, claiming that Osama’s anger 
was an outgrowth of America’s Middle East 
policies. Others saw a religious motivation

to show our solidarity with our 
Islamist brothers. I discovered that 
it was not enough to fight in Af-
ghanistan, but that we had to fight 
on all fronts against communist or 
Western oppression. The urgent 
thing was communism, but the 
next target was America. . . . This 
is an open war up to the end, until 
victory.50
The fortune he used to finance his ter-
rorist activities was derived from an inheri-
tance of more than $300 million from his 
family. Some analysts note that bin Laden 
was the only son of his late father’s least 
favorite wife, who was a Syrian and not a 
Saudi. Bin Laden may have been close to 
his mother, but he may have felt driven to 
achieve stature in the eyes of his father and 
the rest of the family. Bin Laden may have 
been willing to do anything to gain power 
and eclipse his father, who died when bin 
Laden was 10 years old.
The impulse for his murderous actions 
may have stemmed from bin Laden’s efforts 
to gain his father’s approval. He modeled 
his behavior after his father in many ways, 
including working with the Saudi royal fam-
ily on construction deals. Bin Laden once 
told an interviewer of his desire to please 
his father: “My father was very keen that 
one of his sons should fight against the 
would show Americans killing innocent ci-
vilians in Afghanistan, and the umma would 
find it shocking how Americans noncha-
lantly caused Muslims to suffer and die. 
The ensuing outrage would open a chasm 
between the Muslim population of the 
Middle East and the ruling governments in 
states such as Saudi Arabia, which were al-
lied with the West. On October 7, 2001, bin 
Laden made a broadcast in which he said 
that the Americans and the British “have 
divided the entire world into two regions—
one of faith, where there is no hypocrisy, 
and another of infidelity, from which we 
hope God will protect us.”
Whether his motivations were psycho-
logical, political, or religious—or a combina-
tion of all three—is still uncertain. It is likely 
that we will never truly understand Osama’s 
motivations to attack the West.

enemies of Islam. So I am the one son who 
is acting according to the wishes of his fa-
ther.” Perhaps this need for acceptance 
explains bin Laden’s religious zeal, which 
was in excess of anyone else’s in his large 
extended family.
After his father’s death, bin Laden was 
mentored by a Jordanian named Abdullah 
Azzam, whose motto was “Jihad and the 
rifle alone: no negotiations, no conferences, 
and no dialogues.” When Azzam was killed 
in 1989 by a car bomb in Pakistan, bin 
Laden vowed to carry on Azzam’s “holy 
war” against the West. He threw himself 
into the Afghan conflict against the Soviet 
Union, and when the Russians withdrew, 
he was convinced that the West was vul-
nerable. “The myth of the superpower was 
destroyed not only in my mind, but also in 
the minds of all Muslims,” bin Laden has 
told interviewers. His masterminding of the 
9/11 bombing was not designed to restore 
his homeland or bring about a new political 
state, but to have his personal value struc-
ture adopted by Muslim nations. His attack 
may have also been designed to create a 
military invasion of Afghanistan, which he 
hoped to exploit for his particular brand of 
revolution, a plan that has succeeded. Ac-
cording to Michael Scott Doran, bin Laden 
believed his acts would reach the audience 
that concerned him the most: the umma, 
or universal Islamic community. The media 
How do retributive terror groups use violence to achieve 
their goals? According to researchers at the Rand Corpora-
tion, there are actually four independent views on the topic:
Coercion hypothesis
 
■
. Terrorists use violence to cause 
pain, notably casualties, to frighten the United States 
and get it to bend to their will (e.g., withdrawing from 
the Middle East).
Damage hypothesis
 
■
. Terrorists want to damage the U.S. 
economy to weaken its ability to intervene in interna-
tional affairs.
Rally hypothesis.
 
■
 Violence is used to attract the attention 
of potential recruits and supporters.
Franchise hypothesis.
 
■
 Jihadists use violence to pursue 
their own, often local, goals and only receive some 
support and encouragement from international organi-
zations such as al-Qaeda.48
RAND researchers have found that the coercion and 
damage hypotheses are most consistent with prior attack 
patterns.
Today the retributive terrorist can be categorized into 
four main groups:
Al-Qaeda, including the group’s strategy, ideology, op-
 
■
erations, tactics, fi nances, changing character, and pos-
sible future.
Terrorist groups that have adopted al-Qaeda’s world-
 
■
view and concept of mass-casualty terrorist attacks, 
even if the groups are not formally part of al-Qaeda.

394  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
State-sponsored terrorism became a world issue when 
South and Central American dictatorships in the 1970s and 
1980s unleashed state violence against political dissidents 
through forced disappearance, political imprisonment, tor-
ture, blacklisting, and massive exile. The region-wide state 
repression in this period emerged in response to the rise of 
the 1960s radical movements, which demanded public re-
forms and programs to help the lower classes in urban areas 
and agricultural workers in the countryside. Local authori-
tarian governments, which used repression to take control 
of radical political groups, were given fi nancial support by 
the economic elites who dominated Latin American politics 
and were fearful of a socialist revolution.52
As might be expected, governments claim that repres-
sive measures are needed to control terror and revolutionary 
groups that routinely use violence. Thus the use of terror is 
sometimes a way of defending the nation against violence, a 
conundrum that supports the idea that a state is both pro-
tective and destructive.53
It is sometimes diffi cult to assess blame for state terror—is 
it a few rogue government agents who act on their own au-
thority or the government itself? The issue of responsibility 
for improper acts hit home during the Abu Ghraib scandal 
in Iraq. Photos beamed around the world embarrassed the 
United States when they showed military personnel vic-
timizing suspected insurgents. The government’s response 
was to prosecute and imprison the perpetrators. However, 
some critics, such as criminologist Mark Hamm, suggest 
that these images constitute the photographic record of a 
state-sponsored crime.54 He argues that rather than being 
the work of a few rogue offi cers, the sophisticated interroga-
tion practices at Abu Ghraib were designed and executed by 
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and that the torturing 
of detainees at Abu Ghraib followed directly from decisions 
made by top government offi cials to get tough with prisoner 
interrogations. So while we condemn state-sponsored vio-
lence, it is not easy to identify who is truly responsible.
Cult Terrorism
In 1995, members of Aum Shinrikyo, a radical religious 
cult, set off poison gas in a Tokyo subway, killing 12 and 
injuring more than 3,000. The cult members found modern 
society too complex to understand, with few clear-cut goals 
and values.55
Some cults, like Aum Shinrikyo, may be classified as 
cult terror groups because their leaders demand that fol-
lowers prove their loyalty through violence or intimida-
tion.56 These destructive cults are willing to have members 
commit violence, including murder. Members typically fol-
low a charismatic leader who may be viewed as having god-
like powers or even being the reincarnation of an important 
religious fi gure. The leader and his or her lieutenants com-
monly enforce loyalty by severe discipline and by physically

Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are the paradigm of the 
new retributive terrorist organization. Rather than fi ghting 
for a homeland, its message is a call to take up a cause: there 
is a war of civilizations in which “Jews and Crusaders” want 
to destroy Islam and must therefore be defeated. Armed ji-
had is the individual obligation of every Muslim; terrorism 
and violence are appropriate methods for defeating even the 
strongest powers. The end product would be a unifi ed Mus-
lim world, the Caliphate, ruled under Muslim law free of 
Western infl uence. Osama bin Laden’s story is told in the 
accompanying Profi les in Crime feature.
These themes are preached in schools, on the Internet, 
and disseminated in books, cassette tapes, and pamphlets. 
Videotapes are distributed in which al-Qaeda’s leaders ex-
pound on political topics, going as far as calling Western 
leaders liars and drunkards. As a result of this media strat-
egy, al-Qaeda’s messages have penetrated deeply into Mus-
lim communities around the world, fi nding a sympathetic 
response among many Muslims who have a sense of help-
lessness both in the Arab world and in the Western Muslim 
diaspora. Al-Qaeda appears to have had an impact by offer-
ing a sense of empowerment to young men who feel lost in 
their adopted cultures.51
State-Sponsored Terrorism
State-sponsored terrorism occurs when a repressive gov-
ernment regime forces its citizens into obedience, oppresses 
minorities, and stifl es political dissent. Death squads and 
the use of government troops to destroy political opposition 
parties are often associated with political terrorism. Much of 
what we know about state-sponsored terrorism comes from 
the efforts of human rights groups such as London-based 
Amnesty International, whose research shows that tens of 
thousands of people continue to become victims of security 
operations that result in disappearances and executions. Po-
litical prisoners are now being tortured in about 100 coun-
tries, people have disappeared or are being held in secret 
detention in about 20 countries, and government-sponsored 
death squads have been operating in more than 35 coun-
tries. Countries known for encouraging violent control of 
dissidents include Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, 
Peru, Iraq, and Sudan.

CHAPTER 11 | Political Crime and Terrorism  395
In some cases, there has been close cooperation between 
organized criminal groups and guerillas. In other instances, 
the relationship is more superfi cial. For example, the Revolu-
tionary Armed Forces of Colombia imposes a tax on Colom-
bian drug producers, but evidence indicates that the group 
cooperates with Colombia’s top drug barons in running the 
trade. In some instances, the line between being a terrorist or-
ganization with political support and vast resources and being 
an organized criminal group engaging in illicit activities for 
profi t becomes blurred. What appears to be a politically moti-
vated action, such as the kidnapping of a government offi cial 
for ransom, may turn out to be merely a crime for profi t.60
HOW ARE TERROR GROUPS 
ORGANIZED?
Terror groups tend to be networked or hierarchical. Newer 
terrorist organizations tend to be formed as networks, 
loosely organized groups located in different parts of a 
city, state, or country (or worldwide) that share a common 
theme or purpose, but have a diverse leadership and com-
mand structure and are only in intermittent communication 
with one another. While there may be a variety of antigov-
ernment groups operating in the United States, there is little 
evidence that they share a single command structure or or-
ganizational fabric. These groups have few resources and lit-
tle experience, so it is critical that they operate under cover 
and with as little public exposure as possible.
When needed, networked groups can pull factions to-
gether for larger scale operations, such as an attack on a mil-
itary headquarters, or conversely, they can readily splinter 
off into smaller groups to avoid detection when a counter-
terrorism operation is under way. The advent of the Internet 
has significantly improved communications among net-
worked terror groups.
As terror organizations evolve and expand, they may even-
tually develop a hierarchical organization with a commander 
at the top, captains, local area leaders, and so on. Ideologi-
cal and religious groups tend to gravitate toward this model 
since a common creed/dogma controls their operations and 
a singular leader may be needed to defi ne and disseminate 
group principles and maintain discipline. In a hierarchical 
model, the leader has the power to increase or decrease levels 
of violence for political purposes (i.e., they may order their 
followers to initiate a bombing campaign to infl uence an elec-
tion). Schools may be off limits so that the population is not 
antagonized, or schools may become a target to show that the 
government cannot protect their children.
The various forms that terror groups take are summa-
rized in Concept Summary 11.2
preventing members from leaving the group. They may go 
through doomsday drills and maintain a siege mentality, 
fearing attacks from the government. It is not uncommon 
for cult terror groups to begin stockpiling weapons and 
building defensive barricades. The cult may openly or tac-
itly endorse individual killings or mass murder, which may 
be accompanied by mass suicide, either as a further sym-
bolic instrument of their cause or, more commonly, as what 
they perceive to be justifi ed self-defense, a last resort when 
the hostile world starts closing in and the leader’s authority 
is threatened.57
Criminal Terrorism
Sometimes terrorist groups become involved in common-
law crimes such as drug dealing and kidnapping, even sell-
ing nuclear materials. According to terrorism expert Chris 
Dishman, these illegal activities may on occasion become 
so profi table that they replace the group’s original focus. 
Burmese insurgents continue to actively cultivate, refi ne, 
and traffi c opium and heroin out of the Golden Triangle 
(the border between Myanmar [Burma], Thailand, and 
Laos), and some have even moved into the methamphet-
amine market.
In December 2001, six men were arrested by Russian 
security forces as they were making a deal for weapons-
grade uranium. Some of the men were members of the 
Balashikha criminal gang, and they were in possession of 
two pounds of top-grade radioactive material, which can be 
used to build weapons. They were asking $30,000 for the 
deadly merchandise.58 How common is the theft and sale 
of nuclear material? According to the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, from January 1993 to December 2009, a to-
tal of 1,773 incidents were reported. Of these, 351 involved 
unauthorized possession and related criminal activities. In-
cidents included in this category involved illegal possession, 
movement, or attempts to illegally trade in or use nuclear 
material or radioactive sources. Fifteen incidents in this 
category involved high enriched uranium (HEU) or pluto-
nium. There were 500 incidents reported that involved the 
theft or loss of nuclear or other radioactive material and a 
total of 870 cases involving other unauthorized activities, 
including the unauthorized disposal of radioactive materi-
als or discovery of uncontrolled sources. For the period July 
2009 to June 2010, 222 incidents were confi rmed. Of these, 
21 involved possession and related criminal activities, 61 
involved theft or loss, and 140 involved other unauthorized 
activities. During this period, fi ve incidents involved high 
enriched uranium or plutonium, one of which was related 
to illegal possession and four were related to other unau-
thorized activities. 59 And these are the known cases; it is 
impossible to know if client states have already purchased 
enriched uranium or plutonium. Clearly this is a very seri-
ous problem.

Prevention of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Ter-
rorism Act of 2007, but the homegrown threat remains—
and continues to grow.63
Why would someone like Shahzad attempt to bomb one 
of the most crowded sections of the city, potentially killing 
scores of innocent people? He was affluent and success-
ful, not someone bitter because he had been exploited and 
abused. If he did not like the United States, he could have 
chosen to return home to Pakistan, a nation whose culture 
he may have preferred. What made him choose terrorism?
Before terrorism can be effectively fought, controlled, 
and eradicated, it is important to understand something 
about the kind of people who become terrorists, what moti-
vates their behavior, and how their ideas are formed. Unfor-
tunately, this is not an easy task. Terrorism researchers have 
generally concluded that there is no single personality trait 
or behavior pattern that distinguishes the majority of terror-
ists or sets them apart so they can be easily identifi ed and 
apprehended. Some seem truly disturbed, whereas many 
others have not suffered long-term mental illness or dis-
played sociopathic traits and/or tendencies; if that were so, 
bizarre or violent behavior in their early childhood would 
be a giveaway.64 As such, there have been a number of com-
peting visions of why terrorists engage in criminal activities 
such as bombings, shootings, and kidnappings to achieve a 
political end. Four views stand out.
Psychological View
While not all terrorists suffer from psychological defi cits, 
enough do so that the typical terrorist can be described as 
an emotionally disturbed individual who acts out his or 
WHAT MOTIVATES THE 
TERRORIST?
Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in 
Pakistan in June 1979. The youngest of four children, he 
lived a life of privilege by Pakistani standards, attending 
private secular schools not known for extremist teachings. 
After moving to the United States, he earned an M.B.A. at 
the University of Bridgeport in 2005, taking a job as a fi -
nancial analyst with a cosmetics company. Shortly after his 
marriage in 2009, Shahzad quit his job, stopped making 
payments on his house, and then moved to Pakistan with 
his wife and two children. Before returning to the United 
States in 2010, he attended a Pakistani training camp where 
he learned terrorist skills. On May 1, 2010, upon his return 
to the United States, Shahzad bought a Nissan Pathfi nder 
and tried to blow it up with a makeshift bomb in the Times 
Square section of New York City. The SUV failed to explode, 
and Shahzad was promptly captured as he was trying to 
leave the United States on a Dubai-bound fl ight. After his 
apprehension, Shahzad cooperated with authorities and was 
charged with multiple terrorism-related offenses.61
Shahzad, like terror suspect Najibullah Zazi, the admit-
ted leader of a New York City subway bomb plot, seems 
to be part of a growing group of U.S. citizens to develop 
extremist religious views and anti-Western values through 
travels to terrorist hotbeds and visits to websites and chat 
rooms with connections to terrorist groups. Indeed, of the 
nearly 1,000 individuals prosecuted for terrorism-related 
offenses since 9/11, the largest group is American.62 The 
government has reacted by passing legislation such as the 
CONCEPT SUMMARY 11.2 
The Variety of Terror Groups
Revolutionary terrorists
Use violence to frighten those in power and their supporters in order to replace the existing 
government with a regime that holds acceptable political or religious views. 
Political terrorists
Political terrorism is directed at people or groups who oppose the terrorists’ political ideology or 
whom the terrorists define as “outsiders” who must be destroyed. 
Eco-terrorism 
Political terror groups involved in violent actions to protect the environment. 
Nationalist terrorism 
Groups whose actions promote the interests of a minority ethnic or religious group that has been 
persecuted under majority rule and/or wishes to carve out its own independent homeland. 
Retributive terrorism 
Groups that use violence as a method of influence, persuasion, or intimidation in order to achieve a 
particular aim or objective. 
State-sponsored terrorism 
Carried out by a repressive government regime in order to force its citizens into obedience, oppress 
minorities, and stifle political dissent. 
Cult terrorism 
Cults whose leaders demand that followers prove their loyalty through violence or intimidation. 
Criminal terrorism 
Terrorist groups that become involved in common-law crimes such as drug dealing and kidnapping, 
even selling nuclear materials.

CHAPTER 11 | Political Crime and Terrorism  397
family, and society.72 Many have been raised to hate their 
opponents and learn at an early age that they have been 
victimized by some oppressor. Terrorists report that they 
were estranged from their fathers, whom they viewed as 
economically, socially, or politically weak and ineffective. 
They are products of dysfunctional families in which the fa-
ther was absent or, even if present, was a distant and cold 
fi gure.73 Because of this family estrangement, the budding 
terrorist may have been swayed to join a group or cult by 
a charismatic leader who serves as an alternative father fi g-
ure. Some fi nd it in religious schools run by strong leaders 
who demand strict loyalty from their followers while in-
doctrinating them in political causes. This pattern is com-
mon among terror groups in Southeast Asia where teachers 
command strong personal loyalty from their students. This 
loyalty may be lifelong, as illustrated by the three Jemaah 
Islamiyah members (see Exhibit 11.5) who testifi ed against 
their former teacher Abu Bakar Baasyir during his terror 
trial. Despite their willingness to testify for the government, 
two spontaneously started to cry at the sight of their teacher. 
They repeated that they loved him, but urged him to tell the 
truth about his activities.74
In this sense, terror groups, similar to what happens in 
urban street gangs, provide a substitute family-like environ-
ment, which can nurture a heretofore emotionally under-
privileged youth.
Socialization/Friendship View
While alienation and estrangement seem plausible, research 
shows that terrorist operatives are not poor or lacking in 
education. Ironically, many terrorists appear to be educated 
members of the upper class. Osama bin Laden is a multimil-
lionaire and at least some of his followers are highly edu-
cated and trained. The acts of the modern terrorist—using 
the Internet; organizing logistically complex and expensive 
assaults; writing and disseminating formal critiques, mani-
festos, and theories—require the training and education of 
the social elite, not the poor and oppressed.
Marc Sageman studied members of extremist Islamist 
groups and found that most tend to be well educated; about 
60 percent had some form of higher education. More than 
75 percent came from upper- or middle-class backgrounds. 
When they joined a terror organization, the majority had 
professional occupations such as doctor or engineer, or 
semiskilled employment, such as a civil servant; fewer than 
25 percent were unemployed or working in unskilled jobs. 
Surprisingly, Sageman found that almost three-quarters were 
married and that most had children.75 These fi ndings sug-
gest that terrorists are not suffering from the social problems 
usually associated with alienation: poverty, lack of education, 
and ignorance. Sageman found that the vast majority of Is-
lamic terrorists have close social bonds and social networks 
that supported them when they embraced jihad. While they 
may have felt isolated from the rest of society, their tight 
her psychoses within the confi nes of violent groups. Ac-
cording to this view, terrorist violence is not so much a 
political instrument as an end in itself; it is the result of 
compulsion or psychopathology. Terrorists do what they 
do because of garden variety emotional problems, includ-
ing but not limited to self-destructive urges and disturbed 
emotions combined with problems with authority.65 As 
terrorism expert Jerrold M. Post puts it, “Political terror-
ists are driven to commit acts of violence as a consequence 
of psychological forces, and . . . their special psychology 
is constructed to rationalize acts they are psychologically 
compelled to commit.”66
The view that terrorists suffer psychological abnormal-
ity is quite controversial and some critics suggest that it is 
spurious; the majority of research on terrorists indicates 
that most are not psychologically abnormal. Even suicide 
bombers, a group that should show signs of psychological 
abnormality, exhibit few signs of the mental problems such 
as depression that are typically found in people who choose 
to take their own life. After carefully reviewing existing evi-
dence on the psychological state of terrorists, mental health 
expert Randy Borum concludes:
Mental illness is not a critical factor in explaining terror-
 
■
ist behavior. Also, most terrorists are not psychopaths.
There is no “terrorist personality,” nor is there any ac-
 
■
curate profi le—psychological or otherwise—of the 
terrorist.
Histories of childhood abuse and trauma and themes of 
 
■
perceived injustice and humiliation often are prominent 
in terrorist biographies, but do not really help to ex-
plain terrorism.67
It is also possible that engaging in stressful terrorist ac-
tivity results in the development of mental disorders and 
not vice versa.68 Charles Ruby reviewed the literature on the 
psychology of terrorists and found little evidence that terror-
ists are psychologically dysfunctional or pathological. Ruby 
claims that terrorism is a form of politically motivated vio-
lence that is carried out by rational, lucid people who have 
valid motives; if they had more resources, terrorists would 
be military offi cers.69
Alienation View
Some experts believe that a lack of economic opportunity 
and recessionary economies are positively correlated with 
terrorism.70 Because they are out of the political and social 
mainstream, young men and women are motivated to join 
terror groups. Suffering alienation, they lack the tools to 
compete in a post-technological society. Many are relatively 
“ordinary” people who, alienated from modern society, be-
lieve that a suicide mission will cleanse them from the cor-
ruption of the modern world.71
According to this view, if terrorists suffer psychological 
defi ciencies it is because they suffer alienation from friends,

398  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Explaining State Terrorism
How can state-sponsored terrorism be explained? After all, 
these violent acts are not directed at a foreign government 
or overseas adversaries but against natives of one’s own 
country. In her book Reigns of Terror, Patricia Marchak fi nds 
that people willing to kill or maim their fellow countrymen 
are likely to be highly susceptible to unquestioning submis-
sion to authority. They are conformists who want to be part 
of the central group and who are quite willing to be part of 
a state regime. They are vulnerable to ideology that dehu-
manizes their targets and can utilize propaganda to distance 
themselves psychologically from those they are terrorizing.78 
So the Nazis had little trouble recruiting people to carry out 
horrifi c acts during the Holocaust because many Germans 
wanted to be part of the popular social/political movement 
and were easily indoctrinated by the Nazi propaganda that 
branded Jews as subhuman. Stalin was able to carry out his 
reign of terror in Russia because his victims were viewed 
as state enemies who were trying to undermine the Com-
munist regime. How can these tendencies be neutralized? 
Marchak sees little benefi t to international intervention that 
results in after-the-fact punishment of the perpetrators, a 
course of action that was attempted in the former Yugoslavia 
after death squads had performed “ethnic cleansing” of un-
desirables. Instead she argues for a prevention strategy that 
involves international aid and economic development by in-
dustrialized nations to those in the Third World that are on 
the verge of becoming collapsed states, the construction of 
social welfare systems, and the acceptance of international 
legal norms and standards of human rights.79
RESPONSE TO TERRORISM
After the 9/11 attacks, agencies of the criminal justice sys-
tem began to focus their attention on combating the threat 
of terror. Even local police agencies created anti-terror pro-
grams designed to protect their communities from the threat 
of attack. How should the nation best prepare itself to thwart 
potential attacks? The National Commission on Terror-
ist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9/11 
Commission), an independent, bipartisan commission, was 
created in late 2002 and given the mission of preparing an 
in-depth report of the events leading up to the 9/11 attacks. 
Part of their goal was to create a comprehensive plan to en-
sure that no further attacks of that magnitude take place.
To monitor the more than 500 million people who cross 
into America, the commission recommended that a single 
agency should be created to screen border crossings. They also 
recommended creation of an investigative agency to moni-
tor all aliens in the United States and to gather intelligence 
on the way terrorists travel across borders. The commission 
bonds of family and friendship encouraged them to join ter-
ror groups.
Many jihadist recruits were living in foreign countries 
when they got involved with terrorist organizations. Feeling 
homesick, they sought out people with similar backgrounds, 
whom they would often fi nd at mosques.76 If they appeared 
to be motivated by religious fervor, it was because they were 
seeking friends in a foreign land. They moved in together in 
order to share the rent and also to eat together under strict 
Muslim dietary laws. As a result, they formed groups that 
solidifi ed their beliefs and created a sense of group solidar-
ity. If one became committed to terror, others would follow 
rather than let him down.
Religious/Ideological View
Another view is that terrorists hold extreme religious and/or 
ideological beliefs that prompt their behavior. At fi rst they 
have heightened perceptions of oppressive conditions, be-
lieving they are being victimized by some group or govern-
ment. Once these potential terrorists recognize that these 
conditions can be changed by an active governmental re-
form effort that has not happened, they conclude that they 
must resort to violence to encourage change. The violence 
need not be aimed at a specifi c goal. Rather, terror tactics 
must help set in motion a series of events that enlists oth-
ers in the cause and leads to long-term change. “Success-
ful” terrorists believe that their “self-sacrifi ce” outweighs 
the guilt created by harming innocent people. Terrorism, 
therefore, requires violence without guilt; the cause justifi es 
the violence.
Some terrorists are motivated by extreme religious be-
liefs, which often coincide with their ideological views. But 
how can they justify using violence if they are truly reli-
gious, since most of the world’s religions eschew violence? 
Islamic terrorists believe that their commitment to God 
justifi es their extreme actions. They regard the actions of 
people they trust as a testimony to the righteousness of 
their acts. They trust signifi cant others, and rely on their 
wisdom, experience, and testimony and accept their ex-
pressions of faith. To the terrorist, someone like Osama bin 
Laden has demonstrated the strength of his faith by living 
in poverty and giving up a more luxurious and leisurely 
life in the name of God. When he calls them to jihad, they 
are likely to follow, even if it means killing those who deny 
their faith or beliefs. Perceived miracles, such as the de-
feat of a superpower through faith alone (e.g., the Soviet/
Afghan war or the fi ght against the United States in Iraq), 
also increase confi dence in the righteousness of the cause. 
Some have mystical experiences during prayers or dreams 
that demonstrate the existence of God and reinforce faith. 
In a videotape in the fall of 2001, Osama bin Laden said 
that he had banned the reporting of dreams of airplanes fl y-
ing into buildings prior to September 11 for fear of reveal-
ing the plot.77

for many thousands of additional weapons; all of these re-
main vulnerable to theft. Terrorists may also be able to buy 
the knowledge to construct bombs. In one well-known in-
cident, Pakistan’s leading nuclear scientist, A. Q. Khan, sold 
comprehensive “nuclear starter kits” that included advanced 
centrifuge components, blueprints for nuclear warheads, 
and uranium samples in quantities sufficient to make a 
small bomb, and even provided personal consulting services 
to assist in nuclear development.80
Recognizing this problem, law enforcement agencies around 
the country began to realign their resources to combat future 
terrorist attacks. In response to 9/11, law enforcement agen-
cies undertook a number of steps: increasing the number of 
personnel engaged in emergency response planning; updating 
response plans for chemical, biological, or radiological attacks; 
and reallocating internal resources or increasing departmental 
spending to focus on terrorism preparedness.81 Actions con-
tinue to be taken on the federal, state, and local levels.
Federal Law Enforcement One of the most signifi cant 
changes has been a realignment of the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation (FBI), the federal government’s main law enforce-
ment agency. The FBI has announced a reformulation of its 
priorities, making protecting the United States from terrorist 
attack its number one commitment. It is now charged with 
coordinating intelligence collection with the Border Patrol, 
Secret Service, and the CIA. The FBI must also work with 
and share intelligence with the National Counterterrorism 
Center (NCTC)
To carry out its mission, the FBI has expanded its force 
of agents. In addition to recruiting candidates with the tradi-
tional background in law enforcement, law, and accounting, 
the bureau is concentrating on hiring agents with scientifi c 
and technological skills as well as foreign-language profi-
ciency in priority areas such as Arabic, Farsi, Pashtun, Urdu, 
all dialects of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, 
and Vietnamese, and with other priority backgrounds such as 
foreign counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and military in-
telligence. Besides helping in counterterrorism activities, these 
agents staff the Cyber Division, which was created in 2001 to 
coordinate, oversee, and facilitate FBI investigations in which 
the Internet, online services, and computer systems and net-
works are the principal instruments or targets of terrorists.
The FBI and its duties will be discussed more fully in 
Chapter 17 along with other federal law enforcement 
agencies.
CONNECTIONS
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Soon after 
the 2001 attack, President George W. Bush proposed the 
creation of a new cabinet-level agency called the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (DHS), which is engaged in:
suggested that people who wanted passports be tagged with 
biometric measures to make them easily identifi able.
In response to the commission report, a Director of 
National Intelligence (DNI) was created and charged with 
coordinating data from the nation’s primary intelligence-
gathering agencies. The DNI serves as the principal intelli-
gence adviser to the president and the statutory intelligence 
advisor to the National Security Council. On February 17, 
2005, President George W. Bush named U.S. Ambassador to 
Iraq John Negroponte to be the fi rst person to hold the post; 
he was confi rmed on April 21, 2005; the current director is 
James R. Clapper, a former Air Force general and director of 
the Defense Intelligence Agency.
Among the agencies reporting to the DNI is the staff 
of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), which 
is staffed by terrorism experts from the CIA, FBI, and the 
Pentagon; the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board; and the 
National Counterproliferation Center. The NCTC serves as 
the primary organization in the United States government 
for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or 
acquired by the government pertaining to terrorism and 
counterterrorism, excepting purely domestic counterterror-
ism information.
While the 9/11 Commission report outlines what has al-
ready been done, what has not been done, and what needs 
to be done, agencies of the justice system have begun to re-
spond to the challenge.
Confronting Terrorism with Law 
Enforcement
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, even 
before the 9/11 Commission made its report, it became ob-
vious that the nation was not prepared to deal adequately 
with the threat of terrorism. One reason is the very nature of 
American society. Because we live in a free and open nation, 
it is extremely diffi cult to seal the borders and prevent the 
entry of terrorist groups. In his book Nuclear Terrorism, Gra-
ham Allison, an expert on nuclear weapons and national se-
curity, describes the almost superhuman effort it would take 
to seal the nation’s borders from nuclear attack. Every day, 
30,000 trucks, 6,500 rail cars, and 140 ships deliver more 
than 50,000 cargo containers into the United States. And 
while fewer than 5 percent ever get screened, those that do 
are given inspections using external detectors, which may 
not detect nuclear weapons or fi ssile material. The poten-
tial for terrorists to obtain bombs is signifi cant: there are ap-
proximately 130 nuclear research reactors in 40 countries. 
Two dozen of these have enough highly enriched uranium 
for one or more nuclear bombs. If terrorists can get their

400  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
State Law Enforcement Efforts to Combat Terrorism In 
the wake of the 9/11 attacks, a number of states have beefed 
up their intelligence-gathering capabilities and aimed them 
directly at homeland security. California has introduced the 
California Anti-Terrorism Information Center (CATIC), a 
statewide intelligence system designed to combat terrorism. 
It divides the state into operational zones, and links federal, 
state, and local information services in one system. Trained 
intelligence analysts operate within civil rights guidelines 
and utilize information in a secure communications system; 
information is analyzed daily.83 CATIC combines machine-
intelligence with information coming from a variety of po-
lice agencies. The information is correlated and organized 
by analysts looking for trends. Rather than simply operating 
as an information-gathering unit, CATIC is a synthesizing 
process. It combines open-source public information with 
data on criminal trends and possible terrorist activities. Pro-
cessed intelligence is designed to produce threat assessments 
for each area and to project trends outside the jurisdiction. 
The CATIC system attempts to process multiple sources of 
information to predict threats. By centralizing the collection 
and analytical sections of a statewide system, California’s 
Department of Justice may have developed a method for 
moving offensively against terrorism.
Local Law Enforcement Federal law enforcement agen-
cies are not alone in responding to the threat of terrorism. 
And, of course, nowhere is the threat of terrorism being 
taken more seriously than in New York City, one of the main 
targets of the 9/11 attacks, which has established a Coun-
terterrorism Bureau.84 After the 9/11 attacks, the NYPD 
augmented its anti-terrorism forces from 17 to 125 and as-
signed them to the operational control of the Counterterror-
ism Bureau. Teams within the bureau have been trained to 
examine potential targets in the city and attempt to insulate 
them from possible attack. Viewed as prime targets are the 
city’s bridges, the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Cen-
ter, and the United Nations. Bureau detectives are assigned 
overseas to work with the police in several foreign cities, 
including cities in Canada and Israel. Detectives have been 
assigned as liaisons with the FBI and with Interpol, in Lyon, 
France. The city recruits detectives with language skills from 
Pashtun and Urdu to Arabic, Fujianese, and other dialects. 
The New York City Police Intelligence Division has been re-
vamped, and agents are examining foreign newspapers and 
monitoring Internet sites. The department has set up sev-
eral backup command centers in different parts of the city 
in case a terror attack puts headquarters out of operation. 
Backup senior command teams have been created so that 
if people at the highest levels of the department are killed, 
individuals will already have been tapped to step into their 
jobs. For example, the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative 
(LMSI) is a networked surveillance project designed to de-
tect threats and perform preoperational terrorist surveillance 
south of Canal Street in lower Manhattan.
Preventing terrorist attacks within the United States

Reducing America’s vulnerability to terrorism
 
■
Minimizing the damage and recovering from attacks 
 
■
that do occur
On November 19, 2002, Congress passed legislation 
authorizing the creation of the DHS and assigned it the 
mission of providing intelligence analysis and infrastruc-
ture protection, strengthening the borders, improving the 
use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass 
destruction, and creating a comprehensive response and re-
covery division.
Rather than work from the ground up, the DHS com-
bined a number of existing agencies into a superagency. 
Among its components are:
Border and transportation security
 
■
. The Department of 
Homeland Security is responsible for securing our 
nation’s borders and transportation systems, which 
include 350 ports of entry. The department manages 
who and what enters the country, and works to prevent 
the entry of terrorists and the instruments of terrorism 
while simultaneously ensuring the speedy fl ow of legiti-
mate traffi c. The DHS also is in charge of securing ter-
ritorial waters, including ports and waterways.
Emergency preparedness and response
 
■
. The department 
ensures the preparedness of emergency response profes-
sionals, provides the federal government’s response, and 
aids America’s recovery from terrorist attacks and natu-
ral disasters. The department is responsible for reducing 
the loss of life and property and protecting institutions 
from all types of hazards through an emergency man-
agement program of preparedness, mitigation, response, 
and recovery.
Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear countermea-
 
■
sures. The department leads the federal government’s 
efforts in preparing for and responding to the full range 
of terrorist threats involving weapons of mass destruc-
tion. To do this, the department sets national policy and 
establishes guidelines for state and local governments. 
It directs exercises and drills for federal, state, and local 
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) 
response teams and plans. The department is assigned 
to prevent the importation of nuclear weapons and 
material.
Information analysis and infrastructure protection.
 
■
 The de-
partment analyzes information from multiple available 
sources, including the CIA and FBI, in order to assess 
the dangers facing the nation. It also analyzes law en-
forcement and intelligence information.82
The DHS has numerous and varied duties. It is responsi-
ble for port security and transportation systems and manages 
airport security with its Transportation Security Administra-
tion (TSA). It has its own intelligence section, and it covers 
every special event in the United States, including political 
conventions.

CHAPTER 11 | Political Crime and Terrorism  401
These are but two of the many terrorism-related cases that 
have been tried in the nation’s court system. Prosecutions 
began to spike right after 9/11 and continue to grow today; 
there have been more than 820 prosecutions of suspected 
terrorists in the United States in the last decade.87 Some no-
table terrorism prosecutions in recent years are set out in 
Exhibit 11.8.
In addition to the trial courts, the Supreme Court has 
been involved in terror issues ever since Congress autho-
rized President Bush to use “all necessary and appropri-
ate force” against those responsible for the attacks in New 
York and Washington, D.C. Yaser Hamdi, an American 
citizen who had left the United States in his youth, was 
captured in Afghanistan and detained by military forces at 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for supposedly aiding the Taliban. 
He was later moved to a military prison in Norfolk, Vir-
ginia, where he fi led a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that, 
as a U.S. citizen, he was entitled to challenge the consti-
tutionality of his confi nement in federal court. In Hamdi 
v. Rumsfeld (2004), the Supreme Court agreed with his ar-
gument, holding in a 6–3 decision that the due process 
The department is also drawing on the expertise of 
other institutions around the city. For example, medical 
specialists have been enlisted to monitor daily develop-
ments in the city’s hospitals to detect any suspicious out-
breaks of illness that might refl ect a biological attack. And 
the police are conducting joint drills with the New York 
Fire Department to avoid the problems in communication 
and coordination that marked the emergency response on 
September 11.
Combating Terrorism with the Courts
In April 2009, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of 
New York brought federal charges against Haji Juma Khan, 
an Afghan who allegedly provided the Taliban with fund-
ing through his lucrative (and illegal) opium, morphine, 
and heroin trafficking organization, dubbed the “Khan 
Organization.”85 In the same month, Wesam al-Delaema 
pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill U.S. personnel in Iraq. 
He is currently serving his sentence in the Netherlands.86

new laws, and makes changes to more than 15 existing stat-
utes. Its aim is to give sweeping new powers to domestic law 
enforcement and international intelligence agencies in an ef-
fort to fi ght terrorism, to expand the defi nition of terrorist 
activities, and to alter sanctions for violent terrorism. While 
it is impossible to discuss every provision of this sweeping 
legislation here, a few of its more important elements will be 
examined.
The USA Patriot Act USAPA expands all four traditional 
tools of surveillance—wiretaps, search warrants, pen/trap 
orders (installing devices that record phone calls), and sub-
poenas. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), 
which allows domestic operations by intelligence agencies, 
is also expanded. USAPA gives greater power to the FBI to 
check and monitor phone, Internet, and computer records 
without fi rst needing to demonstrate that they were being 
used by a suspect or target of a court order.
The government may now serve a single wiretap, or 
pen/trap order, on any person regardless of whether that 
person or entity is named in a court order. Prior to this act, 
telephone companies could be ordered to install pen/trap 
devices on their networks that would monitor calls coming 
to a surveillance target and to whom the surveillance target 
made calls; the USAPA extends this monitoring to the Inter-
net. Law enforcement agencies may now also obtain the e-
mail addresses and websites visited by a target, and e-mails 
of the people with whom they communicate. It is possible 
to require that an Internet service provider install a device 
that records e-mail and other electronic communications on 
its servers, looking for communications initiated or received 
by the target of an investigation. Under USAPA, the govern-
ment does not need to show a court that the information or 
communication is relevant to a criminal investigation, nor 
does it have to report where it served the order or what in-
formation it received.
The act also allows enforcement agencies to monitor 
cable operators and obtain access to their records and sys-
tems. Before the act, a cable company had to give prior no-
tice to the customer, even if that person was a target of an 
investigation. Information can now be obtained on people 
with whom the cable subscriber communicates, the content 
of the person’s communications, and the person’s subscrip-
tion records; prior notice is still required if law enforcement 
agencies want to learn what television programming a sub-
scriber purchases.
The act also expands the defi nition of “terrorism” and 
enables the government to monitor more closely those peo-
ple suspected of “harboring” and giving “material support” 
to terrorists (Sections 803, 805). It increases the authority of 
the U.S. attorney general to detain and deport noncitizens 
with little or no judicial review. The attorney general may 
certify that he has “reasonable grounds to believe” that a non-
citizen endangers national security and is therefore eligible 
for deportation. The attorney general and secretary of state 
are also given the authority to designate domestic groups as 
clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that U.S. citizens 
be given the opportunity to challenge their confi nement in 
this way.89 The Court also decided in Rasul v. Bush (2004) 
that the federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas cor-
pus petitions from foreign nationals captured outside the 
United States.90
One year later, the Supreme Court heard a case involv-
ing Salim Hamdan, a Yemeni and former driver for Osama 
bin Laden. He was captured by Afghan warlords and turned 
over to U.S. forces in 2001. He was then transferred in 2002 
to Guantanamo Bay and, in 2003, was slated to be tried for 
various conspiracy offenses before a military tribunal. He 
fi led a habeas corpus petition in the U.S. District Court for 
the Western District of Washington, claiming that he could 
not legally be tried by a military tribunal. In a 5–3 deci-
sion, the Supreme Court agreed.91 It held that the military 
commission at issue violated the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949. 
Charges against him were subsequently dropped, but Ham-
dan was later deemed an “unlawful enemy combatant,” tried 
once again before a military tribunal, and convicted. He was 
sentenced to fi ve-and-a-half years in prison, given credit for 
time served, and sent back to Yemen. He was not named a 
combatant before going into his fi rst trial, which is partly 
why the fi rst military tribunal was illegal.
Shortly after Hamdan’s case was decided, Congress 
passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which 
stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas 
 corpus petitions from detainees who have been designated 
as “enemy combatants.” In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme 
Court held that prisoners (even foreign nationals held at 
Guantanamo Bay) had the right to habeas corpus under the 
U.S. Constitution and that their arguments could be heard 
in the federal courts.92 In effect, the Court held that the 
Military Commissions Act of 2006 was an unconstitutional 
suspension of the right to habeas corpus. In October 2009, 
President Obama signed into law the Military Commissions 
Act of 2009, which attempted to improve on—and address 
some of the defi ciencies of—the earlier legislation. For ex-
ample, the new law does not permit a U.S. citizen to be tried 
by a military commission.93
As a result of these cases, detainees, enemy combatants, 
terror suspects, and the like enjoy greater protection now 
than they did in the past. Indeed, all but a few of them en-
joy the same rights as anyone else, whether or not they are 
U.S. citizens.
Confronting Terrorism with the Law
Soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. gov-
ernment enacted several laws focused on preventing further 
acts of violence against the United States and creating greater 
fl exibility in the fi ght to control terror activity. Most impor-
tantly, Congress passed the USA Patriot Act (USAPA) on 
October 26, 2001. The bill is over 342 pages long, creates

Strengthen the capabilities of front-line states to counter 
 
■
local jihadist threats
This approach may work because al-Qaeda’s goal of 
toppling “apostate” regimes in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and 
Pakistan and creating an ultraorthodox pan-Islamic gov-
ernment spanning the world does not sit well with large 
groups of Muslims; their monolithic vision has no room for 
other Muslim sects such as Shi’ites and Sunni moderates. 
Therefore, political and social appeals may help fracture 
local support for al-Qaeda. In addition, the United States 
should seek to deny sanctuaries to terrorist groups and 
strengthen the capabilities of foreign governments to deal 
with terrorist threats, but in an advisory capacity by pro-
viding intelligence. In his recent book Unconquerable Na-
tion, Brian Michael Jenkins, a noted expert on the topic, 
identifi es the strategic principles he believes are the key to 
combating terror in contemporary society. These beliefs are 
summarized in Exhibit 11.9.

noncitizen who is a member.
Civil Rights and the USA Patriot 
Act Although law enforcement agen-
cies may applaud these new laws, civil 
libertarians are troubled because they 
view the act as eroding civil rights. 
Some complain that there are provi-
sions that permit the government to 
share information from grand jury 
proceedings and from criminal wire-
taps with intelligence agencies. First 
Amendment protections may be vio-
lated because the Patriot Act authority 
is not limited to true terrorism inves-
tigations but covers a much broader 
range of activity involving reasonable 
political dissent. Though many critics 
have called for its repeal, it was reau-
thorized in 2006 with a slew of pro-
visions ensuring that the act did not 
violate civil rights by limiting its sur-
veillance and wiretap authorizations.94
Combating Terrorism 
with Politics
In the long run, it may simply be impossible to defeat terror 
groups and end terrorism using military, law enforcement, 
or legal solutions. Using force may play into terrorists’ 
hands and convince them that they are freedom fi ghters val-
iantly struggling against a better armed and more ruthless 
foe. No matter how many terrorists are killed and/or cap-
tured, military/deterrence-based solutions may be doomed. 
Aggressive reprisals will cause terrorist ideology to spread 
and gain greater acceptance in the underdeveloped world. 
The resulting anger and alienation will produce more ter-
rorists than can be killed off through violent responses. 
In contrast, if the terrorist ideology is countered and dis-
credited, the appeal of terror groups such as al-Qaeda will 
wither and die.
One approach suggested by policy experts is to un-
dermine support for terrorist groups by being benevolent 
nation-builders giving aid to the nations that house terror 
groups.95 This is the approach the United States took after 
World War II to rebuild Germany and Japan (the Marshall 
Plan) all the while gaining support for its Cold War struggle 
against the Soviet Union. According to the Rand Corpora-
tion, a nonprofi t research group, the following steps are re-
quired to defeat jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda:

Securing a nonviolent political solution can be tricky. All too often, those aiming to overthrow the 
government resort to violence and terrorism to achieve their objectives. Even peaceful revolutions 
present political problems. In February 2011, hundreds of thousands of antigovernment 
protesters gathered in Tahrir Square, Cairo, Egypt, in an effort to topple the Mubarak government 
that had been in power for more than thirty years. This nonviolent revolution presented a political 
dilemma for the United States: prop up a long-time ally who had lost popular support or join with 
a revolutionary movement whose aim is to topple a friendly government. The United States 
government decided to walk a fine line between the two sides, endorsing the democratic 
aspirations of the protesters but also trying not to abandon a long-time ally. On February 11, 
2011, Mubarak announced he was stepping down and turning over the reins of government to 
the military, proving that not all revolutions need to become violent in order to get results.

 1. Know what is meant by the 
term political crime
Political crime is used to signify 
 
■
illegal acts that are designed to 
undermine an existing govern-
ment and threaten its survival. 
Political crimes can include 
both violent and nonviolent 
acts and range in seriousness 
from dissent, treason, and es-
pionage to violent acts such as 
terrorism or assassination.
 2. Identify the cause of political 
crime
The political criminal and po-
 
■
litical crimes may stem from 
religious or ideological sources. 
They often occupy a gray area 
between conventional and out-
lawed behavior. While common 
criminals may be motivated by 
greed, vengeance, or jealousy, 
political criminals have a some-
what different agenda from 
common criminals. There is no 
set pattern or reason why some-
one becomes a political crimi-
nal. Some use political crime as 
a stepping stone to public offi ce 
while others use it as a method 
to focus their frustrations.
 3. Distinguish between espionage 
and treason
Helping or cooperating with the 
 
■
enemy in a time of war would be 
considered treason. Espionage 
is the practice of obtaining in-
formation about a government, 
organization, or a society that is 
considered secret or confi dential 
SUMMARY
without the permission of the 
holder of the information. In-
dustrial espionage involves un-
ethical or illegal activities such 
as bribing employees to reveal 
trade secrets such as computer 
codes or product formulas.
 4. Know the components of state 
political crime
While some political crimes 
 
■
are committed by people who 
oppose the state, others are 
perpetrated by state authorities 
against the people they are sup-
posed to serve. State political 
crime has fi ve components: po-
litical corruption; illegal domes-
tic surveillance; human rights 
violations; state violence; and 
state-corporate crime.

EXHIBIT 11.9 
Countering Terror
Destroy the jihadist enterprise.
 
■
 Jihadists have proven to be 
flexible and resistant and capable of continued action despite 
sustained military actions. They remain the primary threat to 
U.S. national security and will continue to be so for the fore-
seeable future. Therefore, they must be destroyed and their 
ability to operate damaged.
Conserve resources for a long war.
 
■
 These include blood, 
treasure, the will of the American people, and the support 
of needed allies. This means picking future fights carefully, 
making security measures both effective and efficient, main-
taining domestic support, avoiding extreme measures that 
alienate the people, and cultivating rather than bullying other 
countries.
Wage more-effective political warfare.
 
■
 Political solutions must 
be pragmatic. We must be ready to compromise. Amnesty 
should be offered to terrorists who have become disillusioned. 
Local leaders should be accommodated and deals cut to co-
opt enemies.
Break the cycle of jihadism.
 
■
 Jihadism is a cycle beginning 
with recruitment and ending with death, arrest, or detention. 
Combating terror must involve neutralizing terror groups’ 
ability to radicalize and indoctrinate potential recruits before 
the cycle begins and then, at the end of the cycle, deal ef-
fectively with terror suspects once they have been captured 
and detained.
Impede recruitment.
 
■
 Recruitment sites must be identified and 
made dangerous and therefore unusable. Alternatives to ter-
ror must be offered. Former, now disillusioned terrorists can 
be used to denounce terror and counteract its appeal with 
potential recruits.
Encourage defections and facilitate exits.
 
■
 Potential defectors 
must be identified and encouraged to quit through the prom-
ise of amnesty, cash, job training, and homes.
Persuade detainees to renounce terrorism.
 
■
 Rehabilitation of 
known terror suspects may be more important than prosecu-
tion and imprisonment.
Maintain international cooperation.
 
■
 International cooperation 
is a prerequisite to success, a precious commodity not to be 
squandered by bullying, unreciprocated demands, indiffer-
ence to local realities, or actions that repel even America’s 
closest friends.
Reserve the right to retaliate—a muscular deterrent.
 
■
 Terror 
groups and their sponsors should know that any attack using 
weapons of mass destruction will be met with all-out warfare 
against any group or government known to be or even sus-
pected of being responsible.

acceptable political or religious 
views. Political terrorism is di-
rected at people or groups who 
oppose the terrorists’ political 
ideology or whom the terrorists 
defi ne as “outsiders” who must 
be destroyed. Nationalist ter-
rorism promotes the interests 
of a minority ethnic or religious 
group that believes it has been 
persecuted under majority rule 
and wishes to carve out its own 
independent homeland. Re-
tributive terrorists want to im-
pose their social and religious 
code on others. State-sponsored 
terrorism occurs when a repres-
sive government regime forces 
its citizens into obedience, op-
presses minorities, and stifl es 
political dissent. Destructive 
cults are willing to have mem-
bers commit violence, including 
murder. Sometimes terrorist 
groups become involved in 
common-law crimes such as 
drug dealing and kidnapping, 
even selling nuclear materials.
 8. Know what motivates the 
terrorist
While not all terrorists suffer 
 
■
from psychological defi cits, 
enough do so that the typical 
terrorist can be described as an 
emotionally disturbed individ-
ual who acts out his or her psy-
choses within the confi nes of 
violent groups. Another view is 
that because they are out of the 
political and social mainstream, 
young men and women are 
motivated to join terror groups 
because they suffer alienation 
and lack the tools to compete in 
a post-technological society. Yet 
another view is that terrorists 
hold extreme religious and/or 
ideological beliefs that prompt 
their behavior.
 9. Be familiar with the efforts be-
ing made to centralize intelli-
gence gathering
The Director of National Intelli-
 
■
gence (DNI) is charged with co-
ordinating data from the nation’s 
primary intelligence-gathering 
agencies. The National Counter-
terrorism Center (NCTC) serves 
as the primary organization in 
the U.S. government for analyz-
ing and integrating all intel-
ligence possessed or acquired 
by the government pertaining 
to terrorism and counterterror-
ism, excepting purely domestic 
counterterrorism information.
 10. Describe the efforts by the FBI 
and DHS to fi ght terrorism
The FBI announced a reformu-
 
■
lation of its priorities, making 
protecting the United States from 
terrorist attack its number one 
commitment. It is now charged 
with coordinating intelligence 
collection with the Border Patrol, 
Secret Service, and the CIA. The 
Department of Homeland Secu-
rity (DHS) is the federal agency 
responsible for preventing ter-
rorist attacks within the United 
States, reducing America’s vulner-
ability to terrorism, and minimiz-
ing the damage and recovering 
from attacks that do occur.
 5. Be able to debate the use and 
misuse of torture
The use of torture to gain infor-
 
■
mation from suspected political 
criminals is highly controver-
sial. The use of waterboarding 
has become a national issue 
because there seems to be no 
agreement on whether it is 
torture or a relatively harmless 
instrument of interrogation.
 6. Distinguish among terrorists, 
insurgents, guerillas, and 
revolutionaries
Terrorism is generally defi ned 
 
■
as the illegal use of force against 
innocent people to achieve a 
political objective. The term 
guerilla refers to antigovernment 
forces located in rural areas that 
attack the military, the police, 
and government offi cials. The 
typical goal of an insurgency 
is to confront the existing gov-
ernment for control of all or a 
portion of its territory, or force 
political concessions in sharing 
political power. A revolution 
is generally seen as a civil war 
fought between nationalists and 
a sovereign power that holds 
control of the land, or between 
the existing government and 
local groups over issues of ideol-
ogy and power.
 7. Understand the various forms 
of terrorism
Revolutionary terrorists use vio-
 
■
lence to frighten those in power 
and their supporters in order 
to replace the existing govern-
ment with a regime that holds

406  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
 1. Would you be willing to give 
up some of your civil rights 
in order to aid the war on 
terror?
 2. Should terror suspects arrested 
in a foreign land be given the 
same rights and privileges as an 
American citizen accused of 
crime?
 3. What groups in America might be 
the breeding ground for terrorist 
activity in the United States?
 4. In light of the 9/11 attack, should 
acts of terrorism be treated differ-
ently from other common-law vi-
olent crimes? Should terrorists be 
executed for their acts even if no 
one is killed during their attack?
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
 5. Can the use of torture ever be jus-
tifi ed? Is the “ticking bomb” sce-
nario valid?
 6. A spy gives plans for a new 
weapon to the enemy. They build 
the weapon and use it to kill 
American soldiers. Is the spy 
guilty of murder?

WHEN
When William M. V. Kingsland died in 2006, New York City newspapers printed glowing obituaries 
describing him as an urbane upper-class gentleman, an intellectual, and an art expert.1 His apartment was 
found to contain a vast and impressive collection of more than 300 works of art—paintings, sketches, 
sculptures, and other pieces by such artists as Pablo Picasso, John Singleton Copley, Alberto Giacometti, 
Giorgio Morandi, and Eugene Boudin. Because he left no heirs, New York’s Public Administrator offi ce hired 
two auction houses—Christie’s and Stair Galleries—to sell the art. One of his works, a Giacometti, was 
valued at $900,000 to $1.2 million and a small painting by Morandi would sell for about $600,000. There 
was hitch, though. As Christie’s researched the art to determine its provenance (history of ownership), the 
famed auction house discovered that many of the works had been reported stolen in the 1960s and 1970s.

412  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
losses to consumers, stolen cars can be easily replaced and, 
in most cases, are insured. The true pain of economic crime 
often goes unappreciated. Convicted offenders, especially 
businesspeople who commit white-collar crimes involving 
millions of dollars, often are punished rather lightly.
This chapter is the fi rst of two that reviews the nature 
and extent of economic crime in the United States. It is di-
vided into two principal sections. The fi rst deals with the 
concept of professional crime and focuses on different types 
of professional criminals, including the fence, a buyer and 
seller of stolen merchandise. The chapter then turns to a dis-
cussion of common theft-related offenses or street crime. 
Included within these general offense categories are such 
common crimes as auto theft, shoplifting, and credit card 
fraud. Next, the chapter discusses a more serious form of 
theft, burglary, which involves forcible entry into a person’s 
home or place of work for the purpose of theft. Finally, the 
crime of arson is discussed briefl y. In Chapter 13, attention 
will be given to white-collar crimes and economic crimes 
that involve organizations devoted to criminal enterprise.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF THEFT
Economic crime can be defi ned as acts in violation of the 
criminal law designed to bring fi nancial reward to an of-
fender. In U.S. society, the range and scope of criminal ac-
tivity motivated by fi nancial gain is tremendous: self-report 
studies show that property crime is widespread among the 
young in every social class. National surveys of criminal 
behavior indicate that millions of personal and household 
thefts occur annually, including auto thefts, shoplifting inci-
dents, embezzlements, burglaries, and larcenies.
Upon further investigation, it turns out that the sophisticated Mr. Kingsland was actually born Melvyn Kohn, 
and that—counter to his claims—he grew up in a small apartment and not a manor house, he did not attend 
Groton or Harvard, and he was never actually married to a member of the French royalty.
Kingsland, it turns out, was an art thief, and authorities have been working since his death trying to 
fi gure out what was stolen and who were the legitimate owners. When a 1790 Copley portrait of the Second 
Earl of Bessborough was sold to an art dealer for $85,000, they soon found that it had been stolen in 1971 
from the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard. The case had one more bizarre turn: a mover hired by New York’s 
Public Administrator offi ce to transport Kingsland’s collection to a warehouse was charged for stealing two 
Picasso sketches, each valued at approximately $30,000. And that was not the fi rst time those two sketches 
had been stolen—before they ended up in Kingsland’s collection they were actually fi lched from a New York 
art gallery!2
W
While professional art theft is a specialty, each year millions 
of people suffer billions in losses to thieves. As a group, these 
theft offenses can be defi ned as acts that violate criminal law 
and are designed to bring fi nancial reward to an offender. The 
range and scope of U.S. criminal activity motivated by the 
desire for fi nancial gain are tremendous. Self-report studies 
show that property crime is widespread among the young in 
every social class. National surveys of criminal behavior in-
dicate that almost 20 million personal and household thefts 
occur annually. Though average citizens may be puzzled and 
enraged by violent crimes, believing them to be both sense-
less and cruel, they often view economic crimes with a great 
deal more ambivalence. Society generally disapproves of 
crimes involving theft and corruption, but the public seems 
quite tolerant of the “gentleman bandit,” such as William 
Kingsland, even to the point of admiring such fi gures. They 
pop up as characters in popular myths and legends—such as 
the famed English outlaw Robin Hood—and in fi lms such as 
Ocean’s Eleven (2001) and Ocean’s Twelve (2004), and Ocean’s 
Thirteen (2007) in which a suave George Clooney and rogu-
ish Brad Pitt lead a band of thieves who loot hundreds of 
millions of dollars from casinos, galleries, and so on.
How can such ambivalence toward thievery be ex-
plained? For one thing, if self-report surveys are accurate, 
national tolerance toward economic criminals may be 
prompted by the fact that almost every U.S. citizen has at 
some time been involved in economic crime. Even those 
among us who would never consider ourselves lawbreak-
ers may have at one time engaged in petty theft, cheated on 
our income tax, stolen a textbook from a college bookstore, 
or pilfered from our place of employment. Consequently, it 
may be diffi cult for society to condemn economic criminals 
without feeling hypocritical.
People may also be somewhat more tolerant of eco-
nomic crimes because they never seem to seriously hurt 
anyone—banks are insured, large businesses pass along

individual theft-related crimes began to be defi ned by the 
common law. The most important of these categories are 
still used today.
Theft in the Nineteenth Century: 
Train Robbery and Safecracking
In the nineteenth century, two new forms of theft appeared. 
Train robbery hit the nation hard when, in 1866, $700,000 
(the equivalent of more than $9 million in today’s currency) 
was taken from an Adams Express car on the New York, 
New Haven, and Hartford Railroad; it was the first train 
robbery on record. Also in 1866, the Reno brothers stole 
$13,000 in their fi rst train holdup. The four brothers and 
their gang went on to rob a number of banks and trains in 
southern Indiana and Illinois before being tracked down by 
the Pinkerton Detective Agency in 1868 (three of the four 
Theft, however, is not a phenomenon unique to mod-
ern times; the theft of personal property has been known 
throughout recorded history. The Crusades of the eleventh 
century inspired peasants and downtrodden noblemen to 
leave the shelter of their estates to prey on passing pilgrims.3 
Crusaders felt it within their rights to appropriate the pos-
sessions of any infi dels—Greeks, Jews, or Muslims—they 
happened to encounter during their travels.
By the thirteenth century, returning pilgrims, not con-
tent to live as serfs on feudal estates, gathered in the forests 
of England and the Continent to poach on game that was the 
rightful property of their lord or king and, when possible, 
to steal from passing strangers. By the fourteenth century, 
many such highwaymen and poachers were full-time live-
stock thieves, stealing great numbers of cattle and sheep.4 
The fi fteenth and sixteenth centuries brought hostilities be-
tween England and France in what has come to be known 
as the Hundred Years’ War. Foreign mercenary troops fi ght-
ing for both sides roamed the countryside; loot 
and pillage were viewed as a rightful part of 
their pay. As cities developed and a permanent 
class of propertyless urban poor was estab-
lished,5 theft became more professional. By the 
eighteenth century, three separate groups of 
property criminals were active: skilled thieves, 
smugglers, and poachers.
Skilled thieves 
 
■
typically worked in the 
larger cities, such as London and Paris. 
This group included pickpockets, forgers, 
and counterfeiters, who operated freely. 
They congregated in fl ash houses—public 
meeting places, often taverns, that served 
as headquarters for gangs. Here, deals 
were made, crimes were plotted, and the 
sale of stolen goods was negotiated.6
Smugglers 
 
■
were the second group of 
thieves. They moved freely in sparsely 
populated areas and transported goods, 
such as spirits, gems, gold, and spices, 
without bothering to pay tax or duty.
Poachers
 
■
, the third type of thief, typically 
lived in the country and supplemented 
their diet and income with game that be-
longed to a landlord.
Professional thieves in the larger cities 
banded together into gangs to protect them-
selves, increase the scope of their activities, 
and help dispose of stolen goods. Jack Wild, 
perhaps London’s most famous thief, perfected 
the process of buying and selling stolen goods 
and gave himself the title of Thief-Taker Gen-
eral of Great Britain and Ireland. Before he was 
hanged, Wild controlled numerous gangs and 
dealt harshly with any thief who violated his 
strict code of conduct.7 During this period,

off alarms when they are disturbed. Though these systems 
can be defeated, it requires expensive electronic gear, which 
most criminals can neither afford nor operate. As a result, 
the number of safecrackers has declined, and the crime of 
safecracking is relatively rare.11

CONTEMPORARY THEFT
Theft is still a popular criminal pastime, and millions of 
property and theft-related crimes occur each year. Most 
are committed by occasional criminals who do not defi ne 
themselves by a criminal role or view themselves as commit-
ted career criminals; other theft-offenders are in fact skilled 
professional criminals. The following sections review these 
two orientations toward property crime.
Occasional Thieves
Occasional offenders are not professional criminals, nor 
do they make crime their occupation. Many are school-
age youths who are unlikely to enter into a criminal career 
and whose behavior has been described as drifting between 
conventional and criminal. Added to the pool of amateur 
thieves are adults who may occasionally violate the crimi-
nal law—shoplifters, pilferers, petty thieves—but whose 
main source of income comes from conventional means and 
whose self-identity is not criminal. Added together, their be-
haviors form the bulk of theft crimes.
Occasional thieves do not organize their daily activities 
around crime nor are they committed to crime as a way of 
life. Their decision to steal is spontaneous and based on situ-
ational inducements.12 These are short-term infl uences on 
a person’s behavior that increase risk taking. They include 
psychological factors, such as an immediate and unsolvable 
fi nancial problem, and social factors, such as peer pressure 
to commit a spontaneous criminal act—taking a car for a 
drunken joyride or breaking into a store or home.
While members of every layer of the economy may at 
some time experience a situational inducement, the oppor-
tunity to solve economic crisis through criminal activity is 
structured by class. While the poor are forced to engage in 
low-profi t, high-risk crimes, members of the upper class have 
the opportunity to engage in the more lucrative business-
 related crimes of price fi xing, bribery, and embezzlement.
brothers were lynched by a gang of vigilantes who attacked 
the jail where they were being held before trial).8
Train robbery flourished toward the end of the nine-
teenth century because professional robbers considered 
trains easy pickings.9 Law enforcement was decentralized, 
and robbers could escape over the border to a neighboring 
state to avoid detection. Security arrangements were min-
imal, and robbers could stop, board, and loot trains with 
little fear of capture. As the threat to trains increased, im-
provements were initiated in an effort to deter would-be 
robbers:
Plainclothes offi cers were placed on trains and rode un-
 
■
obtrusively among the passengers.
Baggage cars were equipped with ramps and stalls con-
 
■
taining fl eet horses that could be used to immediately 
pursue bandits.
Cars were made with fi ner precision and strength to 
 
■
make them impregnable.
Forensic science made it easier to identify robbers, and 
 
■
improved communication made it easier to capture 
them.
Federal involvement in train protection extended the 
ability of law enforcement beyond the county or state in 
which the robbery occurred. As a result of these innovations, 
the number of train robberies decreased from 29 in 1900 to 
7 in 1905; by 1920, train robbers had all but disappeared.10
Safecracking Secured boxes and safes have existed for 
centuries, but it wasn’t until early in the twentieth century 
that use of cast iron became widespread and was used to 
create solid metal boxes. Safecracking also underwent a 
dramatic change due to technological changes in the design 
of safes. In the early 1900s, safes were made of manganese 
steel because it was resistant to drilling and was fi reproof. 
With the invention and distribution of acetylene torches in 
the latter part of the nineteenth century, safes constructed 
of manganese became vulnerable and encouraged safecrack-
ers to commit bold crimes. Safe manufacturers fought back 
by constructing safes with alternating sheets of copper and 
steel. The copper diffused heat and made the safe resistant 
to being torched. In response, safecrackers shifted their ap-
proach to attacking safes’ locks and locking mechanisms. 
They developed mechanical devices that either dismantled 
or destroyed locks. Some burglars developed methods of 
peeling the laminated layers of the safe apart.
After World War II, safecrackers began using carbide 
and then diamond drill bits, which tore through metal. Safe 
manufacturers responded by lining safes with new met-
als designed to chip or break drill bits. They also devel-
oped sophisticated security systems featuring light beams, 
which would trip an alarm if the beam was interrupted by 
an intruder. When thieves learned how to neutralize these 
alarms, they were supplanted by motion detectors and ultra-
sonic systems, which fi ll the space with sound waves and set

bought bikes from the kids. They would dismantle the 
bike and use the parts: the wheels, chains, handlebars, 
and so forth.14
Here we can see how would-be criminals may be encour-
aged in their illegal activities by so-called honest people 
who are willing to buy stolen merchandise and gain from 
criminal enterprise.
There is some debate in the criminological literature over 
who may be defi ned as a professional criminal. In his classic 
works, Edwin Sutherland used the term to refer only to thieves 
who do not use force or physical violence in their crimes and 
who live solely by their wits and skill.15 It is more common 
today for criminologists to use the term to refer to any crimi-
nal who identifies with a criminal subculture, who makes 
the bulk of his or her living from crime, and who possesses 
a degree of skill in his or her chosen trade.16 Thus, one can 
become a professional safecracker, burglar, car thief, or fence. 
Some criminologists would not consider drug addicts who 
steal to support their habit as professionals; they lack skill and 
therefore are amateur opportunists rather than professional 
technicians. However, some professional criminals take drugs 
without losing their lofty status in the criminal hierarchy.
Becoming a Professional Thief What we know about 
the lives of professional criminals has come to us through 
their journals, diaries, autobiographies, and the fi rst-person 
accounts they have given to criminologists. The best-known 
account of professional theft is the life of Chic Conwell, in 
Edwin Sutherland’s classic book The Professional Thief.17 
Conwell and Sutherland’s concept of professional theft has 
two critical dimensions.
First, professional thieves engage in limited types of 
crime, which are described in Exhibit 12.1.18 Professionals 
depend solely on their wit and skill. Thieves who use force 
Unlike professionals, occasional thieves do not receive in-
formal peer group support for their crimes. In fact, they will 
deny any connection to a criminal lifestyle and instead view 
their transgressions as being “out of character.” They may see 
their crimes as being motivated by necessity. When appre-
hended, they say they were only “borrowing” the car the police 
caught them with; they were going to pay for the merchandise 
they stole from the store, they just “forgot” to go through the 
checkout line. Because of their lack of commitment to a crimi-
nal lifestyle, occasional offenders may be the most likely to 
respond to the general deterrent effect of the law.
Professional Thieves
In contrast to occasional thieves, professional criminals 
make a signifi cant portion of their income from crime. Pro-
fessionals do not delude themselves with the belief that 
their acts are impulsive, one-time efforts, nor do they em-
ploy elaborate rationalizations to excuse the harmfulness 
of their action (“shoplifting doesn’t really hurt anyone”). 
Consequently, professionals pursue their craft with vigor, 
attempting to learn from older, experienced criminals the 
techniques that will earn them the most money with the 
least risk. Though their numbers are relatively few, profes-
sionals engage in crimes that produce the greater losses to 
society and perhaps cause the more signifi cant social harm.
Professional theft traditionally refers to nonviolent forms 
of criminal behavior that are undertaken with a high degree 
of skill for monetary gain and that exploit interests tending 
to maximize fi nancial opportunities and minimize the pos-
sibilities of apprehension. The most typical forms include 
pocket-picking, burglary, shoplifting, forgery and counter-
feiting, extortion, sneak theft, and confi dence swindling.13
Relatively little is known about the career patterns of 
professional thieves and criminals. From the literature on 
crime and delinquency, three patterns emerge:
Youth come under the infl uence of older, experienced 
 
■
criminals who teach them the trade.
Juvenile gang members continue their illegal activities 
 
■
at a time when most of their peers have dropped out to 
marry, raise families, and take conventional jobs.
Youth sent to prison for minor offenses learn the tech-
 
■
niques of crime from more experienced thieves.
In a classic work, Box Man: A Professional Thief’s Journal, 
Harry King, a professional thief, relates this story about his 
entry into crime after being placed in a shelter-care home by 
his recently divorced mother:
It was while I was at this parental school that I learned 
that some of the kids had been committed there by the 
court for stealing bikes. They taught me how to steal 
and where to steal them and where to sell them. Inci-
dentally, some of the “nicer people” were the ones who

416  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Vincent Swaggi. Through 400 hours of listening to and ob-
serving Swaggi, Klockars found that this highly professional 
criminal had developed techniques that made him almost 
immune to prosecution. During the course of a long and 
profi table career in crime, Swaggi spent only four months in 
prison. He stayed in business, in part, because of his sophis-
ticated knowledge of the law of stolen property. To convict 
someone of receiving stolen goods, the prosecution must 
prove that the accused was in possession of the goods and 
knew that they had been stolen. Swaggi had the skills to make 
sure that these elements could never be proved. Also helping 
Swaggi stay out of the law’s grasp were the close working as-
sociations he maintained with society’s upper classes, includ-
ing infl uential members of the justice system. Swaggi helped 
them purchase stolen items at below-cost, bargain prices. He 
also helped authorities recover stolen goods and therefore 
remained in their good graces. Klockars’s work strongly sug-
gests that fences customarily cheat their thief-clients and at 
the same time cooperate with the law.
Sam Goodman, a fence interviewed by sociologist Darrell 
Steffensmeier, lived in a world similar to Vincent Swaggi’s. He 
also purchased stolen goods from a wide variety of thieves 
and suppliers, including burglars, drug addicts, shoplifters, 
dockworkers, and truck drivers. According to Goodman, to 
be successful, a fence must meet the following conditions:
Upfront cash. 
 
■
All deals are cash transactions, so an ad-
equate supply of ready cash must always be on hand.
Knowledge of dealing
 
■
—learning the ropes. The fence must 
be schooled in the knowledge of the trade, including 
developing a “larceny sense”; learning to “buy right” at 
acceptable prices; being able to “cover one’s back” and 
not get caught; fi nding out how to make the right con-
tacts; and knowing how to “wheel and deal” and how to 
create opportunities for profi t.
Connections with suppliers of stolen goods. 
 
■
The successful 
fence must be able to engage in long-term relationships 
with suppliers of high-value stolen goods who are rela-
tively free of police interference. The warehouse worker 
who pilfers is a better supplier than the narcotics ad-
dict, who is more likely to be apprehended and talk to 
the police.
Connections with buyers. 
 
■
The successful fence must have 
continuing access to buyers of stolen merchandise who 
are inaccessible to the common thief. For example, 
they must make contacts with local pawnshops and 
other distributors of secondhand goods and be able to 
move their material without drawing attention from the 
authorities.23
Complicity with law enforcers. 
 
■
The fence must work out a 
relationship with law enforcement offi cials who invari-
ably fi nd out about the fence’s operations. Steffensmeier 
found that to stay in business the fence must either bribe 
offi cials with good deals on merchandise and cash pay-
ments or act as an informer who helps police recover 
particularly important merchandise and arrest thieves.
or commit crimes that require little expertise are not consid-
ered worthy of the title “professional.” Their areas of activ-
ity include “heavy rackets,” such as bank robbery, car theft, 
burglary, and safecracking. You can see that Conwell and 
Sutherland’s criteria for professionalism are weighted heav-
ily toward con games and trickery and give little attention to 
common street crimes.
The second requirement of professional theft is the ex-
clusive use of wits, “front” (a believable demeanor), and talk-
ing ability. Manual dexterity and physical force are of little 
importance. Professional thieves must acquire status in their 
profession. Status is based on their technical skill, fi nancial 
standing, connections, power, dress, manners, and wide 
knowledge base. In their world, “thief” is a title worn with 
pride. Conwell and Sutherland also argue that professional 
thieves share common feelings, sentiments, and behaviors. 
Of these, none is more important than the code of honor 
of the underworld; even under the threat of the most severe 
punishment, a professional thief must never inform (squeal) 
on his or her fellows. Sutherland and Conwell view profes-
sional theft as an occupation with much the same internal or-
ganization as that characterizing such legitimate professions 
as advertising, teaching, or police work. They conclude:
A person can be a professional thief only if he is rec-
ognized and received as such by other professional 
thieves. Professional theft is a group way of life. One 
can get into the group and remain in it only by the con-
sent of those previously in the group. Recognition as 
a professional thief by other professional thieves is the 
absolutely necessary, universal, and defi nitive character-
istic of the professional thief.19
The sections below describe two types of professional 
thieves: fences and cargo thieves.
The Fence
Some experts have argued that Sutherland’s view of the 
professional thief may be outdated because modern thieves 
often work alone, are not part of a criminal subculture, 
and were not tutored early in their careers by other crimi-
nals.20 However, some important research efforts show that 
the principles set down by Sutherland still have value for 
understanding the behavior of one contemporary criminal 
type—the fence, who earns his or her living solely by buy-
ing and reselling stolen merchandise. The fence’s critical 
role in criminal transactions has been recognized since the 
eighteenth century.21 They act as middlemen who purchase 
stolen merchandise—ranging from diamonds to auto hub-
caps—and resell them to merchants who market them to 
legitimate customers.22
Much of what we know about fences comes from rela-
tively few in-depth studies of the lives and activities of these 
specialized professional criminals. Carl Klockars examined 
the life and times of one successful fence who used the alias

companies, and jewelry stores. When deciding what to pay 
the thief for goods, the fence uses a complex pricing policy: 
professional thieves who steal high-priced items are usually 
given the highest amounts—about 30 to 50 percent of the 
wholesale price. Furs valued at $5,000 may be bought for 
$1,500. However, the amateur thief or drug addict who is 
not in a good bargaining position may receive only 10 cents 
on the dollar.
For more on Sam Goodman’s life, see The Criminological 
Enterprise feature “Confessions of a Dying Thief.”
Fences handle a tremendous variety of products, in-
cluding televisions, cigarettes, stereo equipment, watches, 
autos, and cameras.24 In dealing their merchandise, they 
operate through many legitimate fronts, including art 
dealers, antique stores, furniture and appliance retail-
ers, remodeling companies, salvage companies, trucking 
The height of his personal commitment to 
crime was during the middle phase of his 
career when he was a “big, wide-open” 
fence. Nonetheless, his favorable attitudes 
toward crime and other criminals endured 
into the later “moonlighting” phase of his 
career when he was less involved in crime. 
At that point, he also developed more posi-
tive attitudes toward legitimate people and 
associations (such as his employees and 
legitimate antique dealers). Furthermore, 
the moonlighting phase of his career saw 
some changes in Sam’s self-definition, as 
reflected in this assessment in the final 
weeks of his life (p. 375):
I never cared how the cops saw me 
but I wanted the public to see me 
in a different light. Not as a guy who 
did time, not as a burglar, not even 
as a fence, but as a businessman. 
As a good Joe. In that way I knew 
what I done was wrong. . . . If they 
saw me as a crook, that I could 
handle. But not a [expletive] bum. I 
wanted the people to respect me as 
me. As a businessman taking care 
of business in my shop.
Deviants, even persistent criminals, 
are seldom deviant in all or even most 
aspects of their lives. Sam comfortably 
rubbed shoulders with thieves, gamblers, 
and quasi-legitimate businessmen but also 
courted respectability and pledged alle-
giance to some major normative standards. 
Sam was unapologetic about his criminal 
career. While he realized that his behavior 
may have violated the law, he took pride 
in the way he conducted himself and did 
business, as these deathbed comments 
 illustrate (p. 373):
I do not feel sad about my life. I did 
what I thought I had to do at the 
time. But I would not wish my life 
on somebody else. I made that very 
goddamn plain to your students—a 
life in crime can be a bitch. . . . 
I done wrong, pulled some very 
rank shit. But helped a whole lot of 
people, too. If somebody needed 
something, came into my shop, I 
more or less gave it away. Anyone 
that worked for me, I dealt with 
fairly. Got paid a good dollar and 
helped them out in little ways.
The life of Sam Goodman shows that 
while most criminals age out of crime, 
some do not and remain active throughout 
their life span.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Which of the criminological theories 
best explains Sam Goodman’s life and 
career? For example, how would Samp-
son and Laub explain his involvement in 
fencing? Or is his behavior a matter of 
rational choice?
 2. Speculate on the Internet’s impact on 
professional fencing. How do you sup-
pose stolen merchandise can be sold 
online?

Confessions of a Dying Thief
In their book Confessions of a Dying Thief, 
Darrell Steffensmeier and Jeffery Ulmer 
provide a close-up view into the dynamics 
of career criminal Sam Goodman, a veteran 
thief and fence and quasi-legitimate busi-
nessman. Sam had a criminal career that 
spanned 50 years, beginning in his mid-
teens and ending with his death when he 
was in his sixties. Steffensmeier and Ulmer 
find that unlike amateur criminals who age 
out of crime, professional criminals such as 
Sam, as well as skilled thieves, dealers in 
stolen goods, bookmakers, con artists, sex 
merchants, quasi-legitimate businessmen, 
local racketeers, and Mafiosi frequently 
persist in their criminality until they are too 
old or feeble to do so.
Their interviews with Sam show that 
criminal opportunity is not merely passive: 
professional criminals actively seek out and 
create criminal opportunities that are attrac-
tive. They support their careers by gaining 
different types of criminal knowledge:
Civil knowledge.
 
■
 Widely accessible 
general knowledge that can be put to 
criminal use.
Preparatory knowledge. 
 
■
Prior familiarity 
with criminal orientations, language, at-
titudes, and skills often gained by hang-
ing around with criminal associates and 
observing their lifestyles.

418  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Professional Cargo Thieves
Some professionals work in highly organized groups, target-
ing specifi c items and employing “specialists” who bring a 
different set of criminal skills to the table. Take for example 
professional cargo thieves, whose bases of operations are 
truck yards, hubs for commercial freight carriers, airports, 
and port cities. These thieves prey upon the huge fleet of 
cargo ships, planes, and trucks that bring in a daily array of 
valuable cargoes. While other thieves target cash and jewels, 
these professionals make off with frozen shrimp, clothing, 
and electronic goods. Their criminal activities cost the public 
somewhere between $15 billion and $30 billion a year. Cargo 
thieves use sophisticated operations with well-organized hier-
archies of leadership. They employ specialists who carry out a 
variety of tasks, including thieves and brokers or fences who 
help unload the stolen goods on the black market. “Lump-
ers” physically move the goods, and work with drivers in 
transporting the stolen merchandise from the docks. Gangs 
usually employ a specialist who is an expert at foiling the an-
titheft locks on truck trailers. Cargo thieves heist whole truck 
loads of merchandise—the average freight on a trailer can be 
valued at up to $3 million.26
Criminologists and legal scholars recognize that com-
mon theft offenses fall into several categories linked together 
because they involve the intentional misappropriation of 
property for personal gain. In fencing, goods are bought 
from another who is in illegal possession of those goods. 
In the case of embezzlement, burglary, and larceny, the 
property is taken through stealth. In other kinds of theft, 
such as bad checks, fraud, and false pretenses, goods are 
obtained through deception. Some of the major categories 
of common theft offenses are discussed in the next sections 
in some detail.
LARCENY/THEFT
Larceny/theft was one of the earliest common-law crimes 
created by English judges to defi ne acts in which one person 
took for his or her own use the property of another.27 Ac-
cording to common law, larceny was defi ned as “the trespas-
sory taking and carrying away of the personal property of 
another with intent to steal.”28 Most state jurisdictions have 
incorporated the common-law crime of larceny in their le-
gal codes. Today, defi nitions of larceny often include such 
familiar acts as shoplifting, passing bad checks, and other 
theft offenses that do not involve using force or threats on 
the victim (robbery) or forcibly breaking into a person’s 
home or place of work (burglary).
When it was originally construed, larceny involved 
taking property that was in the possession of the right-
ful owners. For example, it would have been considered 
Fencing seems to contain many of the elements of pro-
fessional theft as described by Sutherland: fences live by 
their wits, never engage in violence, depend on their skill 
in negotiating, maintain community standing based on con-
nections and power, and share the sentiments and behaviors 
of their fellows. The only divergence between Sutherland’s 
thief and the fence is the code of honor; it seems likely that 
the fence is much more willing to cooperate with authorities 
than most other professional criminals.
The Occasional Fence Professional fences have attracted 
the attention of criminologists, but like other forms of theft, 
fencing is not dominated solely by professional criminals. 
A signifi cant portion of all fencing is performed by amateur 
or occasional criminals. Novice burglars, such as juveniles 
and drug addicts, often fi nd it so diffi cult to establish rela-
tionships with professional fences that they turn instead to 
nonprofessionals to unload the stolen goods.25
One type of occasional fence is the part-timer who, unlike 
professional fences, has other sources of income. Part-timers 
are often “legitimate” businesspeople who integrate the stolen 
merchandise into their regular stock. A rental store manager 
who buys stolen merchandise and rents it along with his le-
gitimate merchandise is a part-time fence. An added benefi t 
of the illegitimate part of his work is the profi t he makes on 
these stolen items, which is not reported for tax purposes.
Some merchants become actively involved in theft either 
by specifying the merchandise they want the burglars to steal 
or by “fi ngering” victims. Some businesspeople sell merchan-
dise and then describe the customers’ homes and vacation 
plans to known burglars so that they can steal it back!
Associational fences are amateur fences who barter stolen 
goods for services. These amateurs typically have legitimate 
professional dealings with known criminals such as bail 
bond agents, police offi cers, and attorneys. A lawyer may 
demand an expensive watch from a client in exchange for 
legal services. Bartering for stolen merchandise avoids taxes 
and becomes a transaction in the underground economy.
Neighborhood hustlers buy and sell stolen property as one 
of the many ways they make a living. They keep some of the 
booty for themselves and sell the rest in the neighborhood. 
These dealmakers are familiar fi gures to neighborhood bur-
glars looking to get some quick cash by selling them stolen 
merchandise.
Amateur receivers can be complete strangers approached 
in a public place by someone offering a great deal on valu-
able commodities. It is unlikely that anyone buying a $2,000 
stereo for $200 cash would not suspect that it may have 
been stolen. Some amateur receivers make a habit of buy-
ing suspect merchandise at reasonable prices from a “trusted 
friend,” establishing an ongoing relationship. This practice 
encourages crime because the criminals know that there will 
always be someone to buy their merchandise. In addition 
to the professional fence, the nonprofessional fence may ac-
count for a great deal of criminal receiving. Both professional 
and amateur thieves have a niche in the crime universe.

larceny. Taking a fi rearm from a home or car is automatically 
considered grand larceny.29
How larceny is categorized can have a signifi cant in-
fl uence on the level of punishment. Looking at Virginia 
again as an example, grand larceny is a felony with a 
specifi c punishment of not less than one year in prison 
but not more than 20, or at the discretion of a jury (or 
judge) trying the case, it can also be punished with a jail 
sentence of not more than 12 months and/or a fi ne not 
to exceed $2,500. In contrast, petit larceny is a class 1 
misdemeanor punishable by up to 12 months in jail and/
or a fi ne of up to $2,500.30 The distinction between petit 
and grand larceny can be especially signifi cant in states 
such as California that employ three strikes laws mandat-
ing that someone convicted of a third felony be given a 
life sentence. The difference may not be lost on potential 
criminals: research by John Worrall shows that larceny 
rates in California have been signifi cantly lowered since 
passage of the three strikes law.31
Larceny/theft is probably the most common criminal of-
fense. According to the FBI, about 6 million larcenies are 
reported to the police annually, a rate of about 2,100 per 
100,000 population.32 Despite the rather large number of 
annual larcenies, their number and rate have declined by 
more than 9 percent during the past decade, and the most 
recent data indicate that the downward trend seems to be 
continuing. The average value of property taken during lar-
ceny/thefts is now about $864 per offense. When the average 
value is applied to the estimated number of larceny/thefts, 
the loss to victims nationally was about $5.5 billion. Thefts 
of motor vehicle parts, accessories, and contents make up 
the largest portion of reported larcenies—36 percent.
Types of Larceny
There are many different varieties of larceny. Most involve 
small items of little value. Many of these go unreported, 
however, especially if the victims were business owners 
who do not want to take the time to get involved with 
police. They simply write off the losses as part of doing 
business. Hotel owners estimate that guests filch $100 
million a year in towels, bathrobes, ashtrays, bedspreads, 
shower heads, fl atware, and even television sets and wall 
paintings.33
Other larcenies involve complex criminal conspiracies, 
and no one, not even the U.S. government, is immune. 
Thieves steal millions of dollars worth of government 
equipment and supplies each year. In one incident, the 
Department of Energy reported more than $20 million in 
property missing from its site in Rocky Flats, Colorado, 
including semi-trailers, forklifts, cameras, desks, radios, 
and more than 1,800 pieces of computer equipment.34 
The Profiles in Crime feature focuses on the so-called 
“body snatchers case,” a very unusual, albeit horrifi c, case 
of larceny.
larceny for someone to go secretly into a farmer’s fi eld and 
steal a cow. Thus, the original common-law defi nition re-
quired a “trespass in the taking”; this meant that for an 
act to be considered larceny, goods must have been taken 
from the physical possession of the rightful owner. In cre-
ating this defi nition of larceny, English judges were more 
concerned with people disturbing the peace than they 
were with thefts. If someone tried to steal property from 
another’s possession, they reasoned that the act could 
eventually lead to a physical confrontation and possibly 
the death of one party or the other, thereby disturbing 
the peace! Consequently, the original defi nition of larceny 
did not include crimes in which the thief had come into 
the possession of the stolen property by trickery or de-
ceit. It was therefore not considered larceny if someone 
entrusted with another person’s property decided to keep 
it for themselves.
The growth of manufacturing and the development of 
the free enterprise system required greater protection for 
private property. The pursuit of commercial enterprise often 
required that one person’s legal property be entrusted to a 
second party; therefore larceny evolved to include the theft 
of goods that had come into the thief’s possession through 
legitimate means.
To get around the element of “trespass in the taking,” 
English judges created the concept of constructive posses-
sion. This legal fi ction applied to situations in which per-
sons voluntarily and temporarily gave up custody of their 
property but still believed the property was legally theirs. If 
a person gave a jeweler her watch for repair, she would still 
believe she owned the watch even though she had handed 
it over to the jeweler. Similarly, when a person misplaces 
his wallet and someone else fi nds it and keeps it—although 
identifi cation of the owner can be plainly seen—the concept 
of constructive possession makes the person who has kept 
the wallet guilty of larceny.
Larceny Today
Most U.S. state criminal codes separate larceny into petit 
(or petty) larceny and grand larceny. The former involves 
small amounts of money or property and is punished as a 
misdemeanor. Grand larceny, involving merchandise of 
greater value, is a felony punished by a sentence in the state 
prison. Each state sets its own boundary between grand 
larceny and petty larceny, but $50 to $100 is not unusual. 
For example, in the Virginia Criminal Code the main dis-
tinction between petit and grand larceny is the value of the 
item taken: larceny of an item with a value of $200 or more 
is considered grand larceny, while taking something with a 
value of less than $200 is considered petit larceny. In Vir-
ginia, how the larceny is committed may affect its defi nition: 
stealing money or property worth $5 or more from a per-
son is considered grand larceny, while theft from the person 
of money or property with a value of less than $5 is petit

420  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Shoplifting
On January 24, 2008, law enforcement officers in Polk 
County, Florida, announced the arrest of 18 people in con-
nection with a major shoplifting ring. Initial estimates were 
that the ring had stolen up to $100 million over the past 
fi ve years! When detectives raided their homes, they found 
thousands of cosmetics and over-the-counter drugs that the 
ring had planned to sell at local fl ea markets or over the In-
ternet. Police found out that the group had worked in pairs 
and typically cleared about $4,000 in three minutes. They 
used bags and purses with hidden compartments to conceal 
the stolen goods. They worked with maps and detailed plans 
so that they could avoid hitting any one store too often.35
While organized theft rings that average $20 million 
per year are not the norm, shoplifting is a very common 
form of larceny/theft involving the taking of goods from 
retail stores. Usually shoplifters try to snatch items—jew-
elry, clothes, records, or appliances—when store personnel 
are otherwise occupied, hiding the goods on their person. 
The “fi ve-fi nger discount” is an extremely common form of 
crime. Hayes International, a loss prevention/shrinkage con-
trol consulting business, does an annual survey of 22 ma-
jor retailers around the United States and found that these 
retailers apprehended more than 800,000 shoplifters and 
recovered more than $100 million in a single year (2008). 
And these startling data represent a very small percentage of 
total shoplifting losses, considering that only 22 retail chains 
were surveyed. Hayes estimates that the total national loss 
from shoplifting is $37 billion.
Shoplifting is certainly not unique to the United 
States. In England, about 5 percent of the population is 
sold the body parts to legitimate companies 
that supplied hospitals around the United 
States. Hundreds of people in states as far 
away as Florida, Nebraska, and Texas re-
ceived tissue and bone carved from looted 
corpses, including the cadaver of Alistair 
Cooke, the late host of PBS’s Masterpiece 
Theatre. The tissue was used in such pro-
cedures as joint and heart-valve replace-
ments, back surgery, dental implants, and 
skin grafts. Many of the recipients rushed to 
doctors to be tested for tainted tissue, and 
some filed civil lawsuits. (One New Jersey 
lawyer alone signed up some 200 clients.) 
Mastromarino was charged with opening 
graves, body stealing, forgery, grand lar-
ceny, and racketeering.
Mastromarino had surrendered his 
dental license in 2000 because he was ad-
dicted to the painkiller Demerol. He started 
a career as a body harvester, opening Bio-
medical Tissue Services, an FDA-registered 
company that appeared completely legiti-
mate. However, he got many of the corpses 
from Joseph Nicelli, who had been hired by 
funeral directors in New York, New Jersey, 
and Philadelphia to embalm bodies in his 
Brooklyn facility. A single harvested body 
yielded $7,000 in parts. After Nicelli sold 
the funeral home, he allegedly continued 
to help Mastromarino sneak into the secret 
operating room at night to dissect corpses. 
To hide their crimes, Mastromarino re-
placed looted bones with plumbing pipes, 
and stuffed their surgical gloves and gowns 
into the bodies before stitching them back 
together. After robbing the bodies, the men 
allegedly forged death certificates to hide 
that the tissue had often been stolen from 
bodies that would have been rejected as 
donors, being too old or sick. Some of the 
recipients were subsequently tested for dis-
eases, including hepatitis. While the Food 
and Drug Administration claims that the 
risk of serious infection is fairly remote, an 
agency advisory also mentions that the “ac-
tual infectious risk is unknown.” A 41-year-
old woman who underwent back surgery on 
Long Island and two patients in New Jer-
sey say they contracted syphilis from stolen 
bone tissue.
The body snatchers case illustrates the 
wide variety of schemes that can involve 
taking the possessions of another. In this 
case, the possessions were bodily organs 
and the victims were dead!

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
In November 2004, New York police inves-
tigated the Daniel George and Son Funeral 
Home in Brooklyn to check out what they 
considered to be a routine business dis-
pute. But when they began looking around, 
they found a sealed room outfitted like an 
operating room, with a surgical table and 
overhead lights. They also found FedEx 
receipts made out to companies that pur-
chase human tissue from cadavers for use 
in surgical procedures. The department’s 
Major Case Squad was called in and they 
discovered that a former Manhattan dentist 
named Michael Mastromarino (pictured) 
and three other men were running a mul-
timillion-dollar body-snatching business 
that had looted bones and tissue from more 
than a thousand corpses. The men then

CHAPTER 12 | Property Crime  421
Professional Shoplifters In her pioneering effort, Cam-
eron found that about 10 percent of all shoplifters were 
professionals, like the Polk County ring, who derived the 
majority of their income from shoplifting. Called boosters, 
or heels, professional shoplifters steal with the intention of 
reselling stolen merchandise to pawnshops or fences, usu-
ally at half the original price.
These professionals can walk into a department store, 
fi ll up a cart with expensive medicines, DVDs, iPods, baby 
formula, and other high-cost items, and use deceptive tech-
niques to slip past security guards.42 Hitting several stores in 
a day and the same store once a month, a professional thief 
can make between $100,000 and $200,000 a year. Some 
enter a store carrying a “shopping list” provided by a fence 
who will pay them in cash or drugs. The fence will later sell 
the merchandise in his or her own discount stores, at fl ea 
markets, or through online auctions. Some sell to higher-
level fences who repackage—or “scrub”—the goods and 
pawn them off on retailers at prices that undercut legitimate 
distributors. Ironically, some stolen merchandise can actu-
ally make its way back onto the shelves of the chain store 
from which it was stolen.43
Controlling Shoplifting One major problem associated 
with combating shoplifting is that many customers who ob-
serve pilferage are reluctant to report it to security agents. 
Store employees themselves are often loathe to get involved 
in apprehending a shoplifter. It is also likely that a store 
owner’s decision to prosecute shoplifters will be based on 
the value of the goods stolen, the nature of the goods stolen, 
and the manner in which the theft was realized. Shoplift-
ers who planned their crime by using a concealed appara-
tus, such as a bag pinned to the inside of their clothing, are 
more apt to be prosecuted than those who impulsively put 
merchandise into their pockets.44 The concealment indi-
cates that the crime was premeditated and not a spur of the 
moment loss of control.
To encourage the arrest of shoplifters, a number of states 
have passed merchant privilege laws designed to protect re-
tailers and their employers from litigation stemming from 
improper or false arrests of suspected shoplifters. These 
laws protect but do not immunize merchants from lawsuits. 
They typically require that arrests be made on reasonable 
grounds or probable cause, detention be of short duration, 
and store employees or security guards conduct themselves 
in a reasonable fashion.
Prevention Strategies Retail stores initiate a number 
of strategies designed to reduce or eliminate shoplifting. 
Target removal strategies involve putting dummy or dis-
abled goods on display while the real merchandise is kept 
under lock and key. Audio equipment with missing parts is 
displayed, and only after items are purchased are the neces-
sary components installed. Some stores sell from a catalogue 
while keeping merchandise in stockrooms.
convicted of shoplifting by age 40. Surveys of retailers 
in the United Kingdom suggest that there are more than 
4 million known shoplifting incidents, 1.3 million ap-
prehended shoplifters, and 800,000 shoplifters reported 
to the police each year. One reason for the popularity of 
shoplifting may be lax treatment. Although about one in 
seven apprehended offenders is eventually convicted in 
court, fewer than one in twenty shoplifting attempts re-
sults in apprehension.36
Retail security measures add to the already high cost of 
this crime, all of which is passed on to the consumer. Some 
studies estimate that about one in every nine shoppers steals 
from department stores. Moreover, the increasingly popular 
discount stores, such as Costco, Wal-Mart, and Target, have 
a minimum of sales help and depend on highly visible mer-
chandise displays to attract purchasers, all of which makes 
them particularly vulnerable to shoplifters.
Shoplifters: Amateurs and Professionals In the early 
1960s, Mary Owen Cameron conducted a classic study 
of shoplifting.37 In her pioneering effort, Cameron found 
that the majority of shoplifters are amateur pilferers, called 
snitches in thieves’ argot. Snitches are usually respectable 
people who do not conceive of themselves as thieves but are 
systematic shoplifters who steal merchandise for their own 
use. Some snitches are simply overcome by an uncontrol-
lable urge to snatch something that attracts them, while oth-
ers arrive at the store intending to steal. Some adolescents 
become shoplifters because they have been coerced by older 
kids into becoming “proxy shoplifters,” forced to steal goods 
with the understanding that if caught their youth will pro-
tect them from prosecution.38
When caught, they may try to rationalize or neutral-
ize their behavior. When Paul Cromwell and Quint Thur-
man interviewed 137 apprehended shoplifters, they found 
widespread use of techniques of neutralizations—state-
ments such as, “I don’t know what comes over me. It’s like, 
you know, it’s somebody else doing it, not me” (denial of 
responsibility) or “I like to get nice stuff for my kids, you 
know. I know it’s not O.K., you know what I mean? But 
I want my kids to dress nice and stuff” (appeal to higher 
loyalties).39
If they are not professionals and want to deny their cul-
pability, why do they steal? Some are impulsive sensation 
seekers who are driven to shoplift by their psychological 
need to live on the edge.40 Others are motivated by rational 
choice and the desire to get something for nothing. Still an-
other motivation for shoplifting seems to be psychological 
distress; some amateur shoplifters are looking for a release 
from anxiety and depression.41
Regardless of their motives, snitches are likely to reform 
if caught because they are not part of a criminal subculture 
and do not think of themselves as criminals. Cameron rea-
soned that they are deterred by an initial contact with the 
law. Getting arrested has a traumatic effect on them, and 
they will not risk a second offense.

422  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Edwin Lemert conducted the best-known study of 
check forgers more than 40 years ago.51 Lemert found 
that the majority of check forgers—he calls them naive 
check forgers—are amateurs who do not believe their 
actions will hurt anyone. Most naive check forgers come 
from middle-class backgrounds and have little identifi ca-
tion with a criminal subculture. They cash bad checks 
because of a fi nancial crisis that demands an immediate 
resolution—perhaps they have lost money at the horse 
track and have some pressing bills to pay. Lemert refers 
to this condition as closure. Naive check forgers are of-
ten socially isolated people who have been unsuccessful 
in their personal relationships. They are risk prone when 
faced with a situation that is unusually stressful for them. 
The willingness of stores and other commercial establish-
ments to cash checks with a minimum of fuss to promote 
business encourages the check forger to risk committing a 
criminal act.
Not all check forgers are amateurs. Lemert found that 
a few professionals—whom he calls systematic forgers—
make a substantial living by passing bad checks. However, 
professionals constitute a relatively small segment of the 
total population of check forgers. It is diffi cult to estimate 
the number of such forgeries committed each year or the 
amounts involved. Stores and banks may choose not to press 
charges because the effort to collect the money due them is 
often not worth their while. It is also diffi cult to separate the 
true check forger from the neglectful shopper.
Some of the different techniques used in check fraud 
schemes, which may cost retail establishment upwards of 
$1 billion per year, are set out in Exhibit 11.2.
Credit Card Theft
In 2008, federal authorities uncovered the largest credit 
card scam in history. Eleven people, including three from 
Estonia, three from the Ukraine, two from China, and one 
from Belarus, stole 40 million credit and debit card num-
bers from companies such as Marshall’s, T.J. Maxx, BJ’s 
Wholesale Club, Offi ceMax and Barnes and Noble by hack-
ing into their computer systems and installing “sniffer” pro-
grams designed to capture credit card numbers, passwords, 
and account information as they moved through the retail-
ers’ card processing networks. The thieves then concealed 
the data in encrypted computer servers they controlled in 
the United States and eastern Europe. Some of the credit 
and debit card numbers were “cashed out” by encoding the 
numbers on the magnetic strips of blank cards and using 
these cards to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a 
time from automatic teller machines (ATM).52 This type of 
international credit card theft is not unique. A card stolen 
in Amsterdam can be used to make bogus online purchases 
in Prague within hours. Largely run by former Soviet Union 
residents, these international cartels cost the fi nancial sys-
tem billions each year.53
Target hardening strategies involve locking goods 
in place or having them monitored by electronic systems. 
Clothing stores may use racks designed to prevent large 
quantities of garments from being slipped off easily. Store 
owners may rely on electronic article surveillance (EAS) 
systems, featuring tags with small electronic sensors that 
trip sound and light alarms if not removed by employees 
before the item leaves the store. Security systems now fea-
ture source tagging, a process by which manufacturers em-
bed the tag in the packaging or in the product itself. Thieves 
are hard-pressed to remove or defeat such tags, and retailers 
save on the time and labor needed to attach the tags at their 
stores.45 Situational measures place the most valuable goods 
in the least vulnerable places, use warning signs to deter po-
tential thieves, and use closed-circuit cameras.
Another approach to shoplifting prevention is to create 
specialized programs that use methods such as doing com-
munity service, paying monetary restitution, writing essays, 
watching anti-shoplifting videos, writing apology letters, 
and being placed in individual and/or family counseling. 
Evaluations indicate that such programs can be successful in 
reducing recidivism of young shoplifters.46
Overzealous Enforcement These methods may control 
shoplifting, but stores must be wary of becoming overzeal-
ous in their enforcement policies. Those falsely accused have 
won signifi cant judgments in civil actions.47 In one case, a 
woman accused of shoplifting at a J. C. Penney store in Me-
dia, Pennsylvania, was awarded $250,000, charging them 
with false confi nement and malicious prosecution after she 
was mistakenly taken for a shoplifter.48 Stores may be liable 
if security guards use excessive force when subduing a sus-
pected shoplifter. There is also the danger of profi ling based 
on gender, age, or racial and ethnic background, resulting 
in customers being targeted, detained, and searched for in-
appropriate reasons.49 And of course, searching and detain-
ing customers based on stereotyping is legally indefensible: 
in 2009, eight African American plaintiffs sued the Dillard’s 
department store chain, claiming that employees and secu-
rity workers questioned them while they were shopping in 
the stores and accused them of stealing merchandise, solely 
based on their race. In a separate case, Dillard’s was ordered 
to pay a $1.2 million verdict to an African American woman 
who was detained on suspicion of shoplifting in a store in 
Overland Park, Kansas.50
Bad Checks
Another form of larceny is cashing bad bank checks, know-
ingly and intentionally drawn on a nonexistent or under-
funded bank account, to obtain money or property. In general, 
for a person to be guilty of passing a bad check, the bank 
the check is drawn on must refuse payment, and the check 
casher must fail to make the check good within 10 days after 
fi nding out the check was not honored.

on the accounts of the people whose names and card num-
bers they collected. One approach is to fi rst obtain the vic-
tim’s address and card number from a confederate (e.g., a 
store employee where the victim shops). They may then call 
the victim, claiming to be from the credit card company, and 
informing them that their account has been fl agged because 
of suspicious activity. After offering credentials such as a bo-
gus badge ID number, the thief tells them that someone has 
used the card to purchase a $1,500 television from a local 
store. When the consumer denies making the purchase, the 
scammer explains that he is starting a fraud investigation, 
gives the consumer a “confi rmation” number, and asks them 
for the three-digit security number on the back of the card. 
The security code allows the thief to make purchases over 
the Internet or from local merchants.54
To combat losses from credit card theft, Congress passed 
a law in 1971 limiting a person’s liability to $50 per sto-
len card. Some states, such as California, have passed 
specifi c statutes making it a misdemeanor to obtain prop-
erty or services by means of cards that have been stolen, 
forged, canceled, or revoked, or whose use is for any reason 
unauthorized.55
Similar frauds are conducted over the Internet. These 
will be discussed in Chapter 15.
CONNECTIONS
The problem of credit card misuse is being com-
pounded by thieves who set up bogus Internet sites strictly 
to trick people into giving them their credit card num-
bers, which they then use for their own gain. The Profi les 
in Crime feature discusses one such Internet credit card 
scheme.56 The problem is growing so rapidly that a num-
ber of new technologies are aimed at combating credit card 
number theft over the Internet. One method is to incor-
porate digital signatures into computer operating systems, 
which can be accessed with a digital key that comes with 
each computer. Owners of new systems can present three 
forms of identifi cation to a notary public and trade a no-
tarized copy of their key for a program that will sign fi les. 
The basis of the digital signature is a digital certifi cate, a 
small block of data that contains a person’s “public key.” 
This certifi cate is signed, in turn, by a certifi cate author-
ity. This digital certifi cate will act like a credit card with 
a hologram and a photograph and identify the user to the 
distant website and vice versa.57
Auto Theft
Motor vehicle theft is another common larceny offense. Be-
cause of its frequency and seriousness, it is treated as a sepa-
rate category in the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The FBI 
now records about 800,000 yearly auto thefts, accounting 
The use of stolen credit cards is a major problem in U.S. 
society. It has been estimated that fraud has been respon-
sible for a billion-dollar loss in the credit card industry. Most 
credit card abuse is the work of amateurs who acquire stolen 
cards through theft or mugging and then use them for two 
or three days. However, professional credit card rings may 
be getting into the act. They collect or buy from employees 
the names and credit card numbers of customers in retail 
establishments; then they buy plain plastic cards and have 
the customers’ numbers embossed on them. They create fi c-
titious wholesale companies and apply for and receive au-
thorization to accept credit cards from the customers. They 
then use the phony cards to charge nonexistent purchases

Check Fraud Schemes and Techniques
Forged signatures.
 
■
 Legitimate blank checks with an 
imitation of the payor’s signature.
Forged endorsements.
 
■
 The use of a stolen check, which is 
then endorsed and cashed or deposited by someone other 
than the payee.
Identity assumption.
 
■
 Identity assumption occurs when 
criminals learn information about a financial institution 
customer, such as name, address, financial institution 
account number, Social Security number, home and work 
telephone numbers, or employer, and use the information 
to misrepresent themselves as the valid financial institution 
customer.
Counterfeit checks.
 
■
 Counterfeit checks are presented 
based on fraudulent identification or are false checks 
drawn on valid accounts. Due to the advancement in color 
copying and desktop publishing capabilities, this is the 
fastest-growing source of fraudulent checks today.
Altered checks. 
 
■
After a legitimate maker creates a valid 
check to pay a debt, a criminal then takes the good 
check and uses chemicals or other means to erase 
the amount or the name of the payee, so that new 
information can be entered. The new information can 
be added by typewriter, in handwriting, or with a laser 
printer or check imprinter.
Closed account fraud.
 
■
 This is based on checks being 
written against closed accounts. This type of fraud 
generally relies upon the float time involved in interfinancial 
institution transactions.
Check kiting.
 
■
 The process of depositing a check from 
one bank account into a second bank account without 
sufficient funds to cover it.

for a total loss of $7 billion. Like other crimes, there has 
been a signifi cant reduction in motor vehicle theft rates over 
the past decade, and the number of car thefts has declined 
more than 25 percent. UCR projections on auto theft are 
similar to the projections of the National Crime Victim Sur-
vey (NCVS), probably because almost every state requires 
owners to insure their vehicles, and auto theft is one of the 
most highly reported of all major crimes (75 percent of all 
auto thefts are reported to police).
Which Cars Are Taken Most? According to the Highway 
Loss Data Institute, the rate at which people fi le insurance 
claims for theft is highest for models of the 2007–2009 
Cadillac Escalade, a luxury SUV, followed by the Ford F-250 
crew pickup, Infi niti G37 luxury car, and Dodge Charger 
with a HEMI engine. Theft rates for these vehicles are three 
to five times as high as the average for all vehicles.58 For 
example, as Table 12.1 indicates, while the overall loss per 
vehicle on the road is about $14 per year, for Cadillac Esca-
lades it’s around $128.
Why these models? Many cars are stolen and then 
stripped for parts. Thieves target vehicles that can bring 
them the greatest return in the used-part market.
Amateur Auto Thieves Amateur thieves steal cars for a 
number of reasons that involve some form of temporary 
to sell “protection” policies that would in-
sure that the buyers wouldn’t have to pay 
if thieves ran up a huge tab on account. 
The telemarketers told the victims that if 
they didn’t get this protection, they would 
have to foot the bill for any unauthorized 
charges made if their credit cards were 
stolen. After making their pitch, the vic-
tims were asked: “May we have your credit 
card number, please?” Later, a charge of 
between $199 and $389 appeared on 
their account, even if they didn’t sign up 
for the service.
The scheme was bogus, illegal, and 
entirely unnecessary because most major 
credit card companies protect you from 
fraudulent charges. Still, thousands of 
Americans were victimized by this scam, 
the overwhelming majority elderly. In 
all, they were defrauded out of more than 
$12 million.
Arcand and Galway were ultimately 
caught when some of the victims reported 
their suspicions and complaints to authori-
ties. Arcand was sentenced to 10 years in 
federal prison; Galway pleaded guilty and 
was sentenced to six months in jail.

Credit Card Con
Philip Arcand and his wife, Roberta Gal-
way, lived a life of luxury. They owned two 
homes, one in British Columbia and one in 
Las Vegas. They had a Mercedes, a Cor-
vette, and a Ferrari in their driveways. They 
took frequent trips around the world. All 
this without having jobs. How did they do it? 
Through credit card fraud!
Arcand wrote high-pressure scripts to 
lure in victims, arranged for telemarket-
ing companies to make the pitch, and set 
up businesses to process the illegal cash 
flow. The telemarketers claimed to be from 
a credit card company. They told victims 
how easy it is to steal a credit card number, 
especially over the Internet. They offered

Exhaust.
 
■
 The exhaust system carries emissions from the 
engine to the atmosphere. According to 2010 data, an 
overall exhaust system—including catalytic converter in 
some vehicles—can cost between $500 and $1,000.62
Car Cloning One new form of professional auto theft is 
called “cloning.” After stealing a luxury car from a mall or 
parking lot, car thieves later visit a large car dealership in an-
other state and look for a car that’s the exact make and model 
(and even the same color) of the stolen one. The thieves jot 
down the vehicle identifi cation number (VIN) stamped on 
the top of the dashboard and drive off. The manufacturer-in-
stalled VIN plate on the stolen car is removed and replaced 
with a homemade counterfeit, similar to the original, only 
this one bears the VIN of the legitimate vehicle. Phony own-
ership and registration documents complete the cloning. At 
that point, the stolen vehicle can be easily registered with a 
motor vehicle agency in another state and sold to an unwary 
buyer. In one Tampa, Florida, case, more than 1,000 cloned 
cars were sold to buyers in 20 states and several countries, 
with estimated losses of more than $25 million to consum-
ers, auto insurers, and other victims.
Carjacking You may have read about gunmen approach-
ing a car and forcing the owner to give up the keys; in some 
cases, people have been killed when they reacted too slowly. 
This type of auto theft has become so common that it has its 
own name, carjacking.63 Carjacking is legally considered a 
type of robbery because it involves force to steal.64
Both victims and offenders in carjackings tend to be 
young men. Urban residents are more likely to experience 
carjacking than suburban or rural residents. About half of 
all carjackings are typically committed by gangs or groups. 
These crimes are most likely to occur in the evening, in the 
central city, in an open area, or in a parking garage. This 
pattern may refl ect the fact that carjacking seems to be a 
crime of opportunity; it is the culmination of the carjacker’s 
personal needs and desires coinciding with the immediate 
opportunity for gain. This decision is also shaped by the 
carjacker’s participation in urban street culture.65
Weapons, most often guns, were used in about three-
quarters of all carjacking victimizations.66 Despite the pres-
ence of weapons, victims resisted the offender in two-thirds 
of carjackings, and, not surprisingly, about one-third of vic-
tims of completed carjackings and about 17 percent of vic-
tims of attempted carjackings were injured. Serious injuries, 
such as gunshot or knife wounds, broken bones, or internal 
injuries, occurred in about 9 percent of carjackings. More 
minor injuries, such as bruises and chipped teeth, occurred 
in about 15 percent of cases.
Combating Auto Theft Auto theft is a signifi cant target of 
situational crime prevention efforts. One approach to theft 
deterrence has been to increase the risks of apprehension. 
Hotlines offer rewards for information leading to the arrest 
of car thieves. A Michigan-based program, Operation HEAT 
personal use.59 Among the reasons why an amateur would 
steal a car include:
Joyriding
 
■
. Many car thefts are motivated by teenagers’ 
desire to acquire the power, prestige, sexual potency, 
and recognition associated with an automobile. Joyrid-
ers steal cars not for profi t or gain but to experience, 
even briefl y, the benefi ts associated with owning an 
automobile.
Short-term transportation
 
■
. Auto theft for short-term 
transportation is similar to joyriding. It involves the 
theft of a car simply to go from one place to another. 
In more serious cases, the thief may drive to another 
city or state and then steal another car to continue the 
journey.
Long-term transportation
 
■
. Thieves who steal cars for 
long-term transportation intend to keep the cars for 
their personal use. Usually older than joyriders and 
from a lower-class background, these auto thieves may 
repaint and otherwise disguise cars to avoid detection.
Profi t
 
■
. Auto theft for profi t is motivated by the hope of 
monetary gain. Some amateurs hope to sell the entire 
car, but most are auto strippers who steal batteries, tires, 
and wheel covers to sell or to reequip their own cars.
Commission of another crime
 
■
. A few auto thieves steal 
cars to use in other crimes, such as robberies and thefts. 
This type of auto thief desires both mobility 
and anonymity.
Professional Car Thieves At one time, most auto theft 
was the work of amateurs, and most cars were taken by 
relatively affluent, middle-class teenagers looking for ex-
citement.60 There appears to be a change in this pattern: 
fewer cars are being taken today, and fewer stolen cars are 
being recovered. Part of the reason is that there has been 
an increase in highly organized professionals who resell ex-
pensive cars after altering their identifi cation numbers and 
falsifying their registration papers. Exporting stolen vehicles 
has become a global problem, and the emergence of capital-
ism in Eastern Europe has increased the demand for U.S-
made cars.61
Many cars are now stolen in order to be sold to chop 
shops for spare parts. Among the most attractive targets are 
these parts:
Global positioning system.
 
■
 It now costs approximately 
$1,500 to replace one on a Toyota Camry. The whole 
unit for a Honda Accord can cost up to $650, navigation 
included.
Air conditioning.
 
■
 Today, the air conditioning compres-
sor for a Toyota Camry costs up to $1,000. The Chevy 
Malibu’s A/C compressor would net thieves more than 
$400. Filters and condensers for air conditioning units 
cost more than $200 each.
Air bags.
 
■
 These life savers do well in the auto-part 
seller’s market. Air bags for a Honda Civic fetch about 
$900 apiece.

(Help Eliminate Auto Theft), is credited with recovering 
more than 900 vehicles, worth $11 million, and resulting 
in the arrest of 647 people. Another approach has been to 
place fl uorescent decals on windows that indicate that the 
car is never used between 1 A.M. and 5 A.M.; if police spot a 
car with the decal being operated during this period, they 
know it is stolen.67
The LoJack system involves installing a hidden tracking 
device in cars that gives off a signal, enabling the police to 
pinpoint its location. Research evaluating the effectiveness 
of this device fi nds that it has a signifi cant crime reduction 
capability.68 Because car thieves cannot tell that LoJack has 
been installed, it does not reduce the likelihood that a pro-
tected car will be stolen. However, cars installed with Lo-
Jack have a much higher recovery rate. There may also be a 
general deterrent effect: areas with high rates of LoJack use 
experience signifi cant reductions in their auto theft rates. 
Ironically, LoJack owners actually accrue a smaller than an-
ticipated reward for their foresight than the general public 
because they have to pay for installation and maintenance 
of the device. Those without it actually gain more because 
they benefi t from a lower auto theft rate in their community 
without paying any additional cost.
Other prevention efforts involve making it more diffi -
cult to steal cars. Publicity campaigns have been directed 
at encouraging people to lock their cars. Parking lots have 
been equipped with theft-deterring closed-circuit TV cam-
eras and barriers. Manufacturers have installed more sophis-
ticated steering column locking devices and other security 
systems that make theft more diffi cult.
A study by the Highway Loss Data 
Institute (HLDI) found that most car 
theft prevention methods, especially 
alarms, have little effect on theft rates. 
The most effective methods appear to 
be devices that immobilize a vehicle by 
cutting off the electrical power needed 
to start the engine when a theft is de-
tected.69 However, car thieves with 
modest resources—just a few hundred 
dollars in off-the-shelf equipment—
and some computer knowledge can 
crack the codes of millions of car keys 
and suborn these security systems.70
False Pretenses or Fraud
The crime of false pretenses, or fraud, 
involves misrepresenting a fact in a way 
that causes a victim to willingly give 
his or her property to the wrongdoer, 
who then keeps it.71 In 1757, the Eng-
lish Parliament defi ned false pretenses 
to cover an area of law left untouched 
by larceny statutes. The fi rst false pre-
tenses law punished people who “knowingly and designedly 
by false pretense or pretenses, [obtained] from any person 
or persons, money, goods, wares or merchandise with intent 
to cheat or defraud any person or persons of the same.”72
False pretense differs from traditional larceny because 
the victims willingly give their possessions to the offender, 
and the crime does not, as does larceny, involve a “trespass 
in the taking.” An example of false pretenses would be an 
unscrupulous merchant selling someone a chair by claiming 
it was an antique, but knowing all the while that it was a 
cheap copy. Another example would be a phony healer sell-
ing a victim a bottle of colored sugar water as an elixir that 
would cure a disease.
Swindlers have little shame when defrauding people out 
of their money; they often target the elderly, sick, and in-
fi rm. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, in 2005, swin-
dlers used the tragedy to solicit relief funds from charitable 
and well-meaning victims and then convert the money for 
their own usage.73 Today, about 210,000 people are arrested 
for fraud schemes each year, though that is probably only 
the tip of the iceberg.74
Confidence Games
Some fraudulent schemes involve getting a mark (target) in-
terested in some get-rich-quick scheme, which may have il-
legal overtones; this is known as a confi dence game or con 
game. The criminal’s hope is that when victims lose their 
money, they will be either too embarrassed or too afraid to 
Professional car thieves often prefer older popular models whose parts can easily be sold. They 
usually turn the cars they steal over to “chop shops,” which dismantle them and sell the parts. 
Some take more expensive luxury cars for export to other countries.

CHAPTER 12 | Property Crime  427
have a look at the violin he saw in passing, and as soon 
as it’s produced, he claims it is a valuable antique, per-
haps a Stradivarius worth hundreds of thousands of 
dollars! He asks the owner to give the old violinist his 
business card as soon as he returns. The old violinist 
returns and the business owner offers him a thousand 
dollars for his violin. While the old man seems clueless, 
he asks for more and they settle on a price of $5,000. 
He walks out with the money, and when the owner calls 
the number on the card, ready to resell, he fi nds out it’s 
a false number. The old man and the “dealer” meet up 
later, split the cash, and buy another $50 violin. Hence 
the expression “fi ddling around.”
Third-Party Fraud In some instances of false pretenses, 
the “victim” is a third party, such as an insurance company 
forced to pay for false claims or the people who have to pay 
higher claims because of the swindle. Cheating on an en-
trance exam may be considered third-party fraud because 
the victims are people who took the test honestly and re-
ceived lower grades. One example of an innovative third-
party cheating scheme was instituted by a man named Po 
Chieng Ma, who conspired to sell answers to the Graduate 
Management Administration Test (GMAT), the Graduate 
Record Examinations (GRE), and the Test of English as a 
Foreign Language (TOEFL) to an estimated 788 customers, 
each of whom had paid him between $2,000 and $9,000. 
In the scheme, people were paid to take the multiple-choice 
tests in Manhattan and then call California, where the same 
tests were to be given, with the answers. The answers were 
passed on to Ma, who, taking advantage of the three-hour 
time difference, carved the answers in code on the sides 
of pencils, which were then given to his customers. Ma 
pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice and 
received a four-year prison term for his efforts. In this case, 
there were many victims, including the testing service, uni-
versities, and the students who lost places in school because 
those who infl ated their scores through the scheme were ad-
mitted instead.76
Auto Accident Fraud Another common scheme involves 
fake auto accidents, including the ones described below:
The “swoop and squat.”
 
■
 A driver is stuck in heavy traffi c 
on a busy highway. A confederate cuts off the driver in 
front, forcing him or her to slam on the brakes, resulting 
in a rear-end collision. After the “accident,” everyone 
in the damaged car fi les bogus injury claims with 
the driver’s insurance company. They may even go to 
crooked physical therapists, chiropractors, lawyers, or 
auto repair technicians to further exaggerate their claims.
The drive down.
 
■
 A driver is attempting to merge into a 
traffi c lane. Suddenly, another driver waves her  forward, 
indicating he will allow her to merge. Instead of  letting 
her in, he slams into the car, causing an accident. 
When the police arrive, the “injured” driver denies ever 
call the police. There are hundreds of varieties of con games, 
but the most common is called the pigeon drop.75 Here, a 
package or shopping bag containing money is “found” by a 
con man or woman. A passing victim is stopped and asked 
for advice about what to do, since there is no identifi cation. 
Another “stranger,” who is part of the con, approaches and 
enters the discussion. The three decide to split the money, 
but fi rst, to make sure everything is legal, one of the swin-
dlers goes off to consult a lawyer. Upon returning, he or she 
says that the lawyer claims the money can be split up; fi rst, 
however, each party must prove he or she is fi nancially sta-
ble or has the means to reimburse the original owner, should 
one show up. The victim then is asked to give some good-
faith money for the lawyer to hold. Later, when the victim 
goes to the lawyer’s offi ce to pick up a share of the loot, he 
or she fi nds the address bogus and the money gone.
Other cons include:
A self-proclaimed “contractor” offers an unusually low 
 
■
price for an expensive job such as driveway repair and 
then uses old motor oil rather than asphalt to make the 
“repairs.” The fi rst rain brings disaster. Some cons offer 
a free home inspection that turns up several expensive 
repairs. They then offer a cheap rate to fi x the problem, 
but of course the repairs are actually bogus.
A business offi ce receives a mailing that looks like an 
 
■
invoice with a self-addressed envelope that makes it 
look like it comes from the phone company (walking 
fi ngers on a yellow background). It appears to be a 
contract for an ad in the Yellow Pages. On the back, in 
small print, will be written, “By returning this confi rma-
tion, you’re signing a contract to be an advertiser in the 
upcoming, and all subsequent, issues.” If the invoice is 
returned, the business soon fi nds that it has agreed to a 
long-term contract to advertise in some private publica-
tion that is not widely distributed.
Con artists read the obituary column and then send a 
 
■
surviving spouse bills supposedly owed by the person 
deceased. Or they deliver an item, such as a Bible, that 
they say the deceased relative ordered just before he died.
A con artist, posing as a bank employee, stops a cus-
 
■
tomer as he or she is about to enter the bank. The con 
man claims to be an investigator who is trying to catch 
a dishonest teller. He asks the customer to withdraw 
cash to see if he or she gets the right amount. After the 
cash is withdrawn, the conman asks that it be turned 
over to him so he can check the serial numbers and 
promises to return the cash in a few minutes, gives the 
customer a receipt, and escapes through a back exit.
An old musician carrying his violin enters a restaurant 
 
■
and orders an expensive meal. When asked to pay 
he claims that he left his wallet at home. He begs the 
owner to be allowed to retrieve his money and leaves 
his violin as collateral. While he’s gone, another man 
presents himself to the owner as a rare instrument 
dealer—he has a personal business card. He wants to

his or her property. Store clerks, bank tellers, brokers, and 
merchants gain lawful possession but not legal ownership of 
other people’s money.
Although it is impossible to know how many embezzle-
ment incidents occur annually, the FBI found that about 
20,000 people were arrested for embezzlement in prob-
ably an extremely small percentage of all embezzlers. How-
ever, the number of people arrested for embezzlement has 
increased more than 40 percent during the past 25 years, 
indicating that (a) more employees are willing to steal from 
their employers, (b) more employers are willing to report 
instances of embezzlement, or (c) law enforcement offi cials 
are more willing to prosecute embezzlers. There has also 
been a rash of embezzlement-type crimes around the world, 
especially in third world countries where poverty is all too 
common and the economy is poor and supported by foreign 
aid and loans. Government offi cials and businessmen who 
have their hands on this money are tempted to convert it for 
their own use—a scenario that is sure to increase the likeli-
hood of embezzlement.82

BURGLARY
In common law, the crime of burglary is defined as “the 
breaking and entering of a dwelling house of another in the 
nighttime with the intent to commit a felony within.”83 Bur-
glary is considered a much more serious crime than larceny/
theft because it often involves entering another’s home, a 
situation in which the threat of harm to occupants is great. 
Even though the home may be unoccupied at the time of the 
burglary, the potential for harm to the occupants is so signifi -
cant that most state jurisdictions punish burglary as a felony.
The legal defi nition of burglary has undergone consider-
able change since its common-law origins. When fi rst cre-
ated by English judges during the late Middle Ages, laws 
against burglary were designed to protect people whose 
homes might be set upon by wandering criminals. Includ-
ing the phrase “breaking and entering” in the definition 
protected people from unwarranted intrusions; if an invited 
guest stole something, it would not be considered a bur-
glary. Similarly, the requirement that the crime be commit-
ted at nighttime was added because evening was considered 
the time when honest people might fall prey to criminals.84
In more recent times, state jurisdictions have changed 
the legal requirements of burglary, and most have discarded 
the necessity of forced entry. Many now protect all structures, 
motioning, claims serious injury, and fi les an insurance 
claim with the victim’s company.
The sideswipe.
 
■
 As a driver rounds a corner at a busy 
 intersection with multiple turn lanes, the driver drifts 
slightly into the next lane. The car in that lane, wait-
ing for such an opportunity, steps on the gas and side-
swipes the driver, producing an accident.
The t-bone.
 
■
 A driver is crossing an intersection when 
a car coming from a side street accelerates and hits 
the car. When the police arrive, the driver and several 
planted “witnesses” claim that the driver ran a red light 
or stop sign.77
How common are such fraudulent schemes? Staged ac-
cidents cost the insurance industry about $20 billion a year, 
increasing insurance rates on the average motorist between 
$100 and $300 extra per car per year.78
Embezzlement
On December 14, 2006, Linda Wade Dunn, of Coosada, Al-
abama, was sentenced to 41 months imprisonment for steal-
ing from her employer, Therapeutic Programs, Inc. (TPI), 
which provided services to foster children in therapeutic 
care. From June 1999 through February 2004, Dunn mis-
appropriated approximately $3 million from TPI. How did 
her scheme work? Dunn, the company bookkeeper, wrote 
checks on the TPI account and made them payable to her-
self and to a corporation she controlled. She concealed the 
theft by altering entries in TPI’s records to make it appear 
that the payees of the checks were legitimate. To cover up 
her crimes, she intercepted TPI’s bank statements, which 
contained the cancelled checks that would have implicated 
her in the crime.79
Dunn’s actions constituted embezzlement, a crime that 
occurs when someone who is trusted with property fraudu-
lently converts it—that is, keeps it for his or her own use 
or the use of others. It can be distinguished from fraud on 
the basis of when the criminal intent was formed. Most U.S. 
courts require that a serious breach of trust must have oc-
curred before a person can be convicted of embezzlement. 
The mere act of moving property without the owner’s con-
sent, or damaging it or using it, is not considered embezzle-
ment. However, using it up, selling it, pledging it, giving it 
away, or holding it against the owner’s will is considered to 
be embezzlement.
Embezzlement is not a recent crime. It was mentioned 
in early Greek culture when, in his writings, Aristotle al-
luded to theft by road commissioners and other govern-
ment offi cials.80 It was fi rst codifi ed in law by the English 
Parliament during the sixteenth century to fi ll a gap in the 
larceny law.81 Until then, to be guilty of theft, a person had 
to take goods from the physical possession of another (tres-
pass in the taking). However, as explained earlier, this defi -
nition did not cover instances in which one person trusted 
another and willfully gave that person temporary custody of

may be shaped by the time of day for which the burglary is 
planned: when they operate in daylight, experienced bur-
glars minimize the risk of being spotted and apprehended 
by police by choosing targets in upscale neighborhoods that 
are set back from the street, provide better cover for their 
forced entry, and are less likely to be occupied. Homeown-
ers in affluent neighborhoods have higher employment 
levels, so daylight burglaries are a safer and more lucrative 
bet. After dark, the patterns seem to change—burglars who 
operate at night may shift their targets to apartments and 
townhouses closer to home even though the risk of some-
one being home is greater.86 Whether they operate alone 
or in groups, experienced burglars like to choose targets in 
neighborhoods they know so they can make their way home 
undetected if things go awry.87
Because it involves planning, risk, and skill, burglary has 
been a crime long associated with professional thieves who 
carefully learn their craft. Francis Hoheimer, an experienced 
professional burglar, has described how he learned the “craft 
of burglary” from a fellow inmate, Oklahoma Smith, when 
the two were serving time in the Illinois State Penitentiary. 
Among Smith’s recommendations are these:
Never wear deodorant or shaving lotion; the strange 
scent might wake someone up. The more people there 
are in a house, the safer you are. If someone hears you 
moving around, they will think it’s someone else . . . If 
not just dwelling houses. A majority 
of states have removed the nighttime 
element from burglary defi nitions as 
well. It is common for states to en-
act laws creating different degrees of 
burglary. In this instance, the more 
serious and heavily punished crimes 
involve a nighttime forced entry into 
the home; the least serious involve a 
daytime entry into a nonresidential 
structure by an unarmed offender. 
Several gradations of the offense may 
be found between these extremes.
The Nature and Extent 
of Burglary
The FBI’s definition of burglary is 
not restricted to burglary from a per-
son’s home; it includes any unlawful 
entry of a structure to commit theft 
or felony. Burglary is further catego-
rized into three subclasses: forcible 
entry, unlawful entry where no force 
is used, and attempted forcible entry. 
According to the UCR, about 2 mil-
lion burglaries occur annually, a de-
cline of about 15 percent from 1996. 
Most occur during daylight hours, in residential structures 
(about two-thirds), and result in a loss of more than $1,700 
per burglary.
The NCVS reports that about 3 million residential bur-
glaries are either attempted or completed annually. Despite 
this signifi cant number, the NCVS indicates that the num-
ber and rate of burglaries has declined signifi cantly during 
the past decade, down more than 20 percent.
According to the NCVS, those most likely to be bur-
glarized are relatively poor Latino and African American 
families (annual income under $7,500). Rural owner-
 occupied and single-family residences have lower burglary 
rates than urban, renter-occupied, and multiple-family 
dwellings. Households in the northeast are less likely to 
experience burglary than households in other regions of 
the country.
Planning to Burgle
Some burglars are crude thieves who will smash a window 
and enter a home or structure with minimal preparation; 
others plan out a strategy. In urban areas and their immedi-
ate suburbs, experienced burglars learn to avoid areas of the 
city in which most residents are renters and not homeown-
ers, reasoning that renters are less likely to be suitable targets 
than are more affl uent homeowners.85 However, this decision

Most burglars are amateur occasional thieves rather than professional criminals. Here, Diana 
Palin, the half-sister of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s husband Todd, is shown after her 
arraignment in Palmer, Alaska, April 3, 2009. Palin was charged with two counts of felony 
burglary and misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass and theft in connection with break-ins 
at a home in Wasilla. Palin received a “suspended imposition of sentence.” If she maintains a 
clean record, completes drug treatment, and otherwise complies with the court’s orders, she 
won’t have a felony record.

430  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
In an important book titled Burglars on the Job, Richard 
Wright and Scott Decker describe the working conditions of 
active burglars.94 Most are motivated by the need for cash in 
order to get high; they want to enjoy the good life, “keeping 
the party going” without having to work. As Exhibit 12.3 
shows, they approach their “job” in a rational workmanlike 
fashion, but their lives are controlled by their culture and 
environment. Unskilled and uneducated, urban burglars 
make the choices they do because there are few conven-
tional opportunities for success.
While most burglars are male, more than 30,000 women 
are arrested for burglary annually, about 15 percent of the 
total. What motivates female burglars, and how do they dif-
fer from males? These are the topics of the Race, Culture, 
Gender, and Criminology feature “Are There Gender Differ-
ences in Burglary?”
Commercial Burglary
Some burglars prefer to victimize commercial property 
rather than private homes. Of all business establishments, 
retail stores are burglars’ favorite targets. They display mer-
chandise so that burglars know exactly what to look for, 
where it can be found, and—because the prices are dis-
played—how much they can hope to gain in resale to a 
they call, answer in a muffl ed sleepy voice . . . Never 
be afraid of dogs, they can sense fear. Most dogs are 
friendly, snap your fi nger, they come right to you.88
Despite his elaborate preparations, Hoheimer spent many 
years in confi nement.
Burglars must master the skills of their “trade,” learning 
to spot environmental cues nonprofessionals fail to notice.89
They must learn which targets contain valuables worth 
stealing and which are most likely to prove to be a dry hole. 
Research shows that burglary rates for student-occupied 
apartments are actually much lower than rates for other res-
idences in the same neighborhoods; burglars appear to have 
learned which apartments to avoid.90
Most burglars do not like to travel far from their resi-
dence, choosing neighborhoods with single-family homes 
close by.91 However, experienced burglars are more willing 
to travel to fi nd rich targets. They have access to transpor-
tation that enables them to select a wider variety of targets 
than younger, more inexperienced thieves.92 They also seem 
to be sensitive to police anticrime efforts: when police are 
active and forceful, burglary rates decline. Experienced bur-
glars may locate to safer areas or bide their time and wait 
for the police to reduce their anticrime initiatives as crime 
rates decline.93 The Thinking Like a Criminologist feature 
explores the issue of burglary prevention.
You are a criminology professor at a local college 
who is approached by the local police chief, who 
is quite concerned about high burglary rates in 
some areas of the city. She is a former student of 
yours and well aware of recent developments in 
criminological theory. The chief is a strong ad-
vocate of rational choice theory and has already 
instituted a number of programs based on a 
deterrence/situational crime prevention model 
of control. The existing police initiatives include 
these programs:
The police offer target hardening measures to 
 
■
repeat victims. They install high-tech security equipment in 
homes so the homes can be monitored on a 24-hour basis. The 
police plan an advertising campaign to alert would-be offenders 
that they are on watch at prior target residences.
A new police initiative identifies repeat burglars in the area and 
 
■
provides intervention designed to supply them with legitimate 
economic opportunities to reduce their criminal motivation.
A new school-based program designed to reduce criminal moti-
 
■
vation seeks to raise young people’s awareness of the dangers of 
burglary and how it can result in a long prison sentence.
■  The police have developed a series of envi-
ronmental improvements in the target area 
with a view to minimizing burglary oppor-
tunities. These include improved visibility, 
better access control, and lighting in areas 
that have relatively high burglary rates. They 
have also instituted high-visibility police pa-
trols in these areas to deter criminals from 
committing crimes there.
■  A burglary control model house, fitted with low-
cost methods of security such as strengthened 
door/window frames, bolts, locks, and so on, 
has been built and will be advertised to encour-
age residents to help themselves avoid burglary.
❯❯ The chief has asked you to look over these initiatives and 
write a memo discussing their effectiveness. She wants you to 
develop a policy plan discussing whether you think there are any 
possible ethical pitfalls with these initiatives. If you do find prob-
lems, she wants you to suggest other policy initiatives that might 
prove effective in reducing the opportunity to commit burglary 
and deter potential burglars.

CHAPTER 12 | Property Crime  431
heavily traveled thoroughfares have been found to be less 
vulnerable to burglary than those located farther away; 
commercial establishments in wealthier communities have a 
higher probability of burglary.95
Though alarms have been found to be an effective deter-
rent to burglary, they are less effective in isolated areas be-
cause it takes police longer to respond than on more heavily 
patrolled thoroughfares, and an alarm is less likely to be 
heard by a pedestrian who would be able to call for help. 
Even in the most remote areas, however, burglars are wary 
of alarms and try to choose targets without elaborate or ef-
fective security systems. One study found that the proba-
bility of burglary of non-alarmed properties is 4.57 times 
higher than that of similar property with alarms.96
Careers in Burglary
Some criminals make burglary their career and continually 
develop new and specialized skills to aid their profession. 
Neal Shover has studied the careers of professional burglars 
and has uncovered the existence of a particularly success-
ful type which he labels “the good burglar.”97 Professional 
burglars use this title to characterize colleagues who have 
distinguished themselves as burglars. Characteristics of the 
good burglar include:
Technical competence
 
■
Maintenance of personal integrity
 
■
Specialization in burglary
 
■
Financial success
 
■
The ability to avoid prison sentences
 
■
To receive recognition as good burglars, Shover found that 
novices must develop four key requirements of the trade.
First, they must learn the many skills needed to com-
mit lucrative burglaries. This process may include learning 
how to gain entry into homes and apartment houses; how 
to select targets with high potential payoffs; how to choose 
items with a high resale value; how to open safes properly, 
without damaging their contents; and how to use the proper 
equipment, including cutting torches, electric saws, explo-
sives, and metal bars.
Second, the good burglar must be able to team up to 
form a criminal gang. Choosing trustworthy companions is 
essential if the obstacles to completing a successful job—
police, alarms, and secure safes—are to be overcome.
Third, the good burglar must have inside information. 
Without knowledge of what awaits them inside, burglars 
can spend a tremendous amount of time and effort on empty 
safes and jewelry boxes.
Finally, the good burglar must cultivate fences or buyers 
for stolen wares. Once the burglar gains access to people 
who buy and sell stolen goods, he or she must also learn 
how to successfully sell these goods for a reasonable profi t. 
Evidence of these skills was discovered in a study of more 
than 200 career burglars in Australia. Burglars reported that 
fence. Burglars can legitimately enter a retail store during 
business hours and gain knowledge about what the store 
contains and where it is stored; they can also check for se-
curity alarms and devices. Commercial burglars perceive 
retail establishments as quick sources of merchandise that 
can be easily sold.
Other commercial establishments such as service cen-
ters, warehouses, and factories are less attractive targets be-
cause it is more diffi cult to gain legitimate access to plan the 
theft. The burglar must use a great deal of guile to scope out 
these places, perhaps posing as a delivery person. In addi-
tion, the merchandise is more likely to be used, and it may 
be more diffi cult to fence at a premium price.
If burglars choose to attack factories, warehouses, or 
service centers, the most vulnerable properties are those lo-
cated far from major thoroughfares and away from pedes-
trian traffi c. Establishments located within three blocks of 
EXHIBIT 12.3
Burglars on the Job
According to active burglars:
Most avoid occupied residences, considering them high-
 
■
risk targets.
Most are not deterred by alarms and elaborate locks; in 
 
■
fact, these devices tell them there is something inside 
worth stealing.
Some call occupants from a pay phone, and if the phone 
 
■
is still ringing when they arrive, they know no one is 
home.
Once entering a residence, anxiety turns to calm as they 
 
■
first turn to the master bedroom for money and drugs. 
They also search kitchens believing that some people keep 
money in a mayonnaise jar.
Most work in groups, one serving as a lookout while 
 
■
another ransacks the place.
Some dispose of goods through a professional fence; 
 
■
others try to pawn the goods. Some exchange goods for 
drugs; some sell them to friends and relatives; and a few 
keep the stolen items for themselves, especially guns and 
jewelry.
Many approach a target masquerading as workmen, such 
 
■
as carpenters or house painters.
Some stake out residences to learn occupants’ routines.
 
■
Tipsters help them select attractive targets.
 
■
Drug dealers are favored targets because they tend to have 
 
■
a lot of cash and drugs, and victims are not going to call 
the police.
Targets are often acquaintances.

they had developed a number of relatively safe methods for 
disposing of their loot. Some traded stolen goods directly 
for drugs; others used fences, legitimate businesses, pawn-
brokers, and secondhand dealers as trading partners. Sur-
prisingly, many sold their illegal gains to family or friends. 
Burglars report that disposing of stolen goods was actually 
low risk and more effi cient than expected. One reason was 
that in many cases fences and shady businesspeople put in 
a request for particular items, and the readymade market 
allowed the stolen merchandise to be disposed of quickly, 
often in less than one hour. Though the typical markdown 
was 67 to 75 percent of the price of the goods, most reported 
Does gender play a role in shaping bur-
glary careers? Are there differences in the 
way professional male and female burglars 
approach their craft? Do gender roles influ-
ence the burglar lifestyle? To find out, Chris-
topher Mullins and Richard Wright used 
interviews with 18 active female burglars 
and 36 males, matched approximately for 
age. Their findings indicate that significant 
gender-based differences exist in the way 
males and females begin and end their 
offending careers and how they carry out 
their criminal tasks.
There were similarities in the way most 
offenders, male or female, were initiated 
into residential burglary. Burglars of both 
genders became involved via interaction in 
intimate groups, such as older friends, fam-
ily members, or street associates. One told 
how they got started in burglary:
[M]e and my brother, we wanted, 
you know, he came and got me and 
say he know where a house at to 
break into. And, uhm, we go there 
and uh, we just do it . . . me and my 
brother, he and some more friends.
But there was one key difference be-
tween the male and female offenders: the 
men typically became involved in burglary 
with male peers; women more often were 
introduced to crime by their boyfriends. 
Males are more likely to bring their male 
peers and family members into their offend-
ing networks and resist working with women 
except their girlfriend or female relative. And 
when they do include women, they put them 
in a subservient role, such as a lookout.
Why do they get involved in a burglary 
career in the first place? Both males and 
females generally said they got involved in 
break-ins to finance a party lifestyle cen-
tered on drug use and to buy designer 
clothing and bling-bling jewelry. There were 
some differences: males reportedly wanted 
money to pursue sexual conquests; female 
burglars were far more likely to say that 
they needed money to buy necessities for 
their children.
When asked what they were looking for 
in a prospective residential burglary target, 
the male and female offenders expressed 
similar preferences; both wanted to find 
a dwelling that was (a) unoccupied and 
(b) contained something of value. Both 
the men and the women wanted to know 
something about the people who lived in 
the residence, be familiar with their day-to-
day routine, and to have an idea of the tar-
get’s valuables. Male offenders used their 
legitimate jobs as home remodelers, cable 
television installers, or gardeners to scout 
potential burglary targets. Female burglars 
who lacked legitimate entry had to rely on 
information generated by the men in their 
immediate criminal social network. Some 
used sexual attraction to gain the victim’s 
confidence and gather information.
Mullins and Wright also found that men 
preferred to commit residential burglaries 
by themselves, while women most often 
worked with others. Males seemed unwill-
ing to trust accomplices and were also un-
willing to share the proceeds. Females, on 
the other hand, reported that they lacked 
the knowledge or skills needed to break into 
a dwelling on their own and were therefore 
more willing to work with a team.
Finally, when asked what it would take 
to make them stop committing crime, both 
male and female offenders claimed that a 
good job that paid well and involved little 
or no disciplined subordination to authority 
would be required to get them to give up 
their careers in crime. Men also claimed 
they would probably give up burglary once 
they settled down and started a family. Be-
cause they were dependent on male help, 
female burglars needed to sever their re-
lationships with criminally involved males 
in order to reduce their offending. Female 
burglars were also more sensitive than the 
males to shaming and ostracism at the 
hands of their relatives and might quit un-
der family pressure.
Mullins and Wright found that residen-
tial burglary is a significantly gender-strat-
ified offense; the processes of initiation, 
commission, and potential desistance are 
heavily structured by gender. Women have 
to negotiate the male-dominated world of 
burglary to accomplish their crimes. Gen-
der, they found, plays a significant role in 
shaping opportunity (such as initiation) and 
the events leading up to residential burglar-
ies (for example, information gathering), 
while playing a lesser but still important role 
in molding actual offense commission.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Do the gender differences in burglary 
reflect the gender differences found in 
other segments of society?
 2. Do you think gender discrimination 
helps reduce the female crime rate? If 
gender equality were achieved, would 
differences in the crime rate narrow?

tial Burglary,” Criminology 41 (2003): 813–839.

Cromwell, Olson, and Avary also found that many bur-
glars had serious drug habits and that their criminal activity 
was, in part, aimed at supporting their substance abuse.
Repeat Burglary To what extent do burglars strike the 
same victim more than once? Research suggests that bur-
glars may in fact return to the scene of the crime to repeat 
their offenses. One reason is that many burgled items are 
indispensable (for example, televisions and DVD play-
ers); therefore, it is safe to assume that they will quickly 
be replaced.101 Research shows that some burglars repeat 
their acts to steal these replacement goods.102 Graham Far-
rell, Coretta Phillips, and Ken Pease have articulated why 
burglars would most likely try to hit the same target more 
than once:
It takes less effort to burgle a home or apartment 
 
■
known to be a suitable target than an unknown or un-
suitable one.
The burglar is already aware of the target’s layout.
 
■
The ease of entry of the target has probably not 
 
■
changed, and escape routes are known.
The lack of protective measures and the absence of nosy 
 
■
and intrusive neighbors that made the fi rst burglary a 
success have probably not changed.
Goods have been observed that could not be taken out 
 
■
the fi rst time.103
The repeat burglary phenomenon should mean that 
homes in close proximity to a burgled dwelling have an in-
creased burglary risk, especially if they are similar in struc-
ture to the initial target. But research shows that lack of 
diversity in the physical construction and general appear-
ance of dwellings in a neighborhood actually helped reduce 
repeat victimization. Housing diversity allows offenders 
a choice of targets, and favored targets will be revisited by 
burglars. If houses are identical, there is no motive for an of-
fender to favor one property over another, and therefore the 
risk of repeat victimization is limited.104
ARSON
Arson is the willful and malicious burning of a home, public 
building, vehicle, or commercial building. Close to 60,000 
arsons are now recorded each year, with an average loss of 
about $17,000.
Arson has been a common occurrence in America and 
was even tried as a weapon during the Civil War. In 1864, 
a small group of Confederate agents attempted to set New 
York City ablaze by using a liquid called “solidifi ed Greek 
fire”; the plot failed because they improperly used the 
chemical.105
that they could still earn a good living, averaging $2,000 per 
week. Those who benefi ted most from these transactions 
were the receivers of stolen property, who make consider-
able profi ts and are unlikely to be caught.98
According to Shover, a person becomes a good burglar 
by learning the techniques of the trade from older, more 
experienced burglars. During this process, the older bur-
glar teaches the novice how to handle such requirements as 
dealing with defense attorneys, bail bond agents, and other 
agents of the justice system. Apprentices must be known to 
have the appropriate character before they are taken under 
the wing of the old pro. Usually, the opportunity to learn 
burglary comes as a reward for being a highly respected ju-
venile gang member, from knowing someone in the neigh-
borhood who has made a living at burglary, or, more often, 
from having built a reputation for being solid while serving 
time in prison. Consequently, the opportunity to become a 
good burglar is not open to everyone.
Shover finds that the process of becoming a profes-
sional burglar is similar to the process described in 
Sutherland’s theory of differential association. You can 
read more about this theory in Chapter 7.
CONNECTIONS
The Burglary “Career Ladder” Paul Cromwell, James 
Olson, and D’Aunn Wester Avary interviewed 30 active bur-
glars in Texas and found that burglars go through stages of 
career development. They begin as young novices who learn 
the trade from older, more experienced burglars, frequently 
siblings or relatives. Novices will continue to get this tutor-
ing as long as they can develop their own markets (fences) 
for stolen goods. After their education is over, novices enter 
the journeyman stage, characterized by forays in search of 
lucrative targets and careful planning. At this point, they de-
velop reputations as experienced reliable criminals. Finally, 
they become professional burglars when they have developed 
advanced skills and organizational abilities that give them 
the highest esteem among their peers.
The Texas burglars also displayed evidence of rational 
decision making. Most seemed to carefully evaluate poten-
tial costs and benefits before deciding to commit crime. 
There is evidence that burglars follow this pattern in their 
choice of burglary sites. Burglars show a preference for cor-
ner houses because they are easily observed and offer the 
maximum number of escape routes.99 They look for houses 
that show evidence of long-term care and wealth. Though 
people may erect fences and other barriers to deter burglars, 
these devices may actually attract crime because they are 
viewed as protecting something worth stealing: if there is 
nothing valuable inside, why go to so much trouble to se-
cure the premises?100

fi re service, these programs are designed to identify, evalu-
ate, and treat juvenile fi re setters to prevent the recurrence of 
fi re-setting behaviors. A promising approach is the FireSafe 
Families effort in Rhode Island, which combines a training 
curriculum for fi re-safety educators, a training program for 
community professionals to identify potential behavior that 
may lead to arson, and a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
program to treat children who are at risk of becoming juve-
nile fi re starters and their families.111
Professional Arson
Other arsons are set by professional arsonists who engage in 
arson for profi t. People looking to collect insurance money, 
but who are afraid or unable to set the fi re themselves, hire 
professional arsonists. These professionals have acquired 
the skills to set fi res yet make the cause seem accidental (for 
example, like an electrical short). Another form is  arson 
fraud, which involves a business owner burning his or her 
property, or hiring someone to do it, to escape financial 
problems.112 Over the years, investigators have found that 
businesspeople are willing to become involved in arson to 
collect fi re insurance or for various other reasons, including 
but not limited to these:
Obtaining money during a period of fi nancial crisis
 
■
Getting rid of outdated or slow-moving inventory
 
■
Destroying outmoded machines and technology
 
■
Paying off legal and illegal debt
 
■
Relocating or remodeling a business; for example, when 
 
■
a theme restaurant has not been accepted by customers
Taking advantage of government funds available for 
 
■
redevelopment
Applying for government building money, pocketing it 
 
■
without making repairs, and then claiming that fi re de-
stroyed the “rehabilitated” building
Planning bankruptcies to eliminate debts, after the mer-
 
■
chandise supposedly destroyed was secretly sold before 
the fi re
Eliminating business competition by burning out rivals
 
■
Employing extortion schemes that demand that victims 
 
■
pay up or the rest of their holdings will be burned
Solving labor–management problems; arson may be 
 
■
committed by a disgruntled employee
Concealing another crime, such as embezzlement
 
■
Some recent technological advances may help prove that 
many alleged arsons were actually accidental fi res. There is 
now evidence of a fi re effect called fl ashover. During the 
course of an ordinary fi re, heat and gas at the ceiling of a 
room can reach 2,000 degrees. This causes clothes and fur-
niture to burst into fl ame, duplicating the effects of arsonists’ 
gasoline or explosives. It is possible that many suspected ar-
sons are actually the result of fl ashover.113
There are several motives for arson. Adult arsonists may 
be motivated by severe emotional turmoil. Some psycholo-
gists view fi re starting as a function of a disturbed personal-
ity. Arson, therefore, should be viewed as a mental health 
problem and not a criminal act.106 It is alleged that arson-
ists often experience sexual pleasure from starting fi res and 
then observing their destructive effects. Although some ar-
sonists may be aroused sexually by their activities, there is 
little evidence that most arsonists are psychosexually mo-
tivated.107 It is equally likely that fi res are started by angry 
people looking for revenge against property owners or by 
teenagers out to vandalize property. These fi ndings support 
the claim that arson should be viewed as a mental health 
problem, not a criminal act, and that it should be treated 
with counseling and other therapeutic measures rather than 
severe punishments.108
The Juvenile Fire Starter
Juveniles, the most prolifi c fi re starters, may get involved in 
arson for a variety of reasons as they mature. Juvenile fi re 
setting has long been associated with psychological abnor-
mality, including depression conduct problems, such as dis-
obedience, aggressiveness, anger, hostility, and resentment 
over parental rejection.109 According to research by sociolo-
gist Wayne Wooden, juvenile arsonists can be classifi ed in 
one of four categories:
The “playing with matches” fi re setter. 
 
■
This is the youngest 
fi re starter, usually between the ages of 4 and 9, who 
sets fi res because parents are careless with matches and 
lighters. Proper instruction on fi re safety can help pre-
vent fi res set by these young children.
The “crying for help” fi re setter. 
 
■
This type of fi re setter is a 
7- to 13-year-old who turns to fi re to reduce stress. The 
source of the stress could be family confl ict, divorce, 
death, or abuse. These youngsters have diffi culty ex-
pressing their feelings of sorrow, rage, or anger and turn 
to fi re as a means of relieving stress or getting back at 
their antagonists.
The “delinquent” fi re setter. 
 
■
Some youth set fi re to school 
property or surrounding areas to retaliate for some 
slight experienced at school. These kids may break into 
the school to vandalize property with friends and later 
set a fi re to cover up their activities.
The “severely disturbed” fi re setter. 
 
■
This youngster is 
obsessed with fi res and often dreams about them in 
“vibrant colors.” This is the most disturbed type of juve-
nile fi re setter and the one most likely to set numerous 
fi res with the potential for death and damage.110
During the past decade, hundreds of jurisdictions across 
the nation have established programs to address the growing 
problem of juvenile fi re setting. Housed primarily within the

CHAPTER 12 | Property Crime  435
 1. Be familiar with the history of 
theft offenses
Common theft offenses include 
 
■
larceny, fraud, and embezzle-
ment. These are common-law 
crimes, originally defi ned by 
English judges. Skilled thieves 
included pickpockets, forgers, 
and counterfeiters, who oper-
ated freely. Smugglers trans-
ported goods, such as spirits, 
gems, gold, and spices, without 
paying tax or duty. Poachers 
supplemented their diet and in-
come with game that belonged 
to a landlord.
 2. Recognize the differences be-
tween professional and amateur 
thieves
Economic crimes are designed 
 
■
to reap fi nancial rewards for the 
offender. Opportunistic amateurs 
commit the majority of economic 
crimes. Economic crime has also 
attracted professional criminals. 
Professionals earn most of their 
income from crime, view them-
selves as criminals, and possess 
skills that aid them in their law-
breaking behavior. An example 
of the professional criminal is the 
fence who buys and sells stolen 
merchandise.
 3. Know the similarities and dif-
ferences between petty and 
grand larceny
Larceny, the most common theft 
 
■
crime, involves taking the legal 
possessions of another. Petty lar-
ceny is typically theft of amounts 
under $100 to $500 (depending 
on state law); grand larceny is 
theft over that amount. Grand 
larceny is a felony, petit larceny a 
misdemeanor.
 4. Understand the various forms 
of shoplifting
Some shoplifters are amateurs 
 
■
who steal on the spur of the 
moment. These snitches are oth-
erwise respectable persons who 
do not conceive of themselves as 
thieves but systematically steal 
merchandise for their own use. 
Some adolescents become shop-
lifters because they have been 
coerced by older kids. Called 
boosters or heels, professional 
shoplifters steal with the inten-
tion of reselling stolen merchan-
dise to pawnshops or fences, 
usually at half the original price. 
Boosters know how to hit stores 
without being detected and 
have partners who can unload 
merchandise after it is stolen.
 5. Differentiate between fraud and 
embezzlement
The crime of false pretenses, 
 
■
or fraud, is similar to larceny 
in that it involves the theft of 
goods or money. Fraud differs 
from common-law larceny be-
cause the criminal tricks victims 
into voluntarily giving up their 
possessions. Embezzlement in-
volves people taking something 
that was temporarily entrusted 
to them. Bank tellers who take 
money out of the cash drawer 
and keep it for themselves are 
committing embezzlement.
 6. Compare the activities of profes-
sional and amateur car thieves
Auto theft usually involves 
 
■
amateur joyriders who “borrow” 
cars for short-term transporta-
tion. Some steal cars so they 
can commit other crimes. Pro-
fessional auto thieves steal cars 
to sell the parts that are highly 
valuable. Car thieves take or-
ders from chop shops and look 
for particular cars.
 7. Understand what it means to 
burgle a home
Under common law, the crime 
 
■
of burglary was defi ned as “the 
breaking and entering of a dwell-
ing house of another in the 
nighttime with the intent to com-
mit a felony within.” Burglary is a 
serious crime because it involves 
entering another’s home, which 
threatens occupants. More recent 
U.S. state laws have changed the 
SUMMARY
requirements of burglary, and 
most have discarded the neces-
sity of forced entry.
 8. Know what it takes to be a 
“good burglar”
Because burglary involves 
 
■
planning and risk, it attracts 
professional thieves. The most 
competent have technical skill 
and personal integrity, specialize 
in burglary, are fi nancially suc-
cessful, and avoid prison sen-
tences. Professional burglars size 
up the value of a particular crime 
and balance it against the per-
ceived risks. Many have under-
gone training in the company of 
older, more experienced burglars.
 9. Distinguish between the 
 activities of male and female 
burglars
Both male and female burglars 
 
■
engage in other forms of theft, 
such as shoplifting and assault. 
Males are more likely to steal 
cars to supplement their income. 
Female burglars are much more 
likely to work with a partner, 
whereas males are more likely 
to go it alone. Males also begin 
their offending careers at an 
earlier age than females and are 
more likely to be repeat and re-
current offenders.
10. Discuss why people commit ar-
son for profi t
Arson is the willful, malicious 
 
■
burning of a home, public 
building, vehicle, or commer-
cial building. Most arsonists are 
teenage vandals. Professional 
arsonists specialize in burning 
commercial buildings for profi t. 
The owners of commercial 
buildings may resort to arson to 
get rid of outdated inventory, to 
qualify for government redevel-
opment funds, to collect insur-
ance money, to claim the loss of 
merchandise already sold, or to 
eliminate business competition 
(by burning a building owned 
by a competitor).

 1. Differentiate between an occa-
sional and a professional crimi-
nal. Which one would be more 
likely to resort to violence? 
Which one would be more easily 
deterred?
 2. What crime occurs when a person 
who owns an antique store sells a 
client an “original” Tiffany lamp 
that the seller knows is a fake? 
Would it still be a crime if the 
person selling the lamp was not 
aware that it was a fake? As an an-
tique dealer, should the seller 
have a duty to determine the au-
thenticity of the products he or 
she sells?
 3. What are the characteristics of 
good burglars? Can you compare 
their career path to any other

professionals, such as doctors or 
lawyers? Which theory of crimi-
nal behavior best predicts the 
development of the good 
burglar?
 4. You have been the victim of repeat 
burglaries. What could you do to 
reduce the chances of future vic-
timization? (Hint: Buying a gun is 
not an option!)

ROBERT
Robert Allen Stanford was a fi nancier who lived like a king on the tropical island of Antigua.1 “Sir Robert” 
(as he liked to be called after being knighted by the Antiguan Prime Minister) ran a renowned investment 
bank that offered investors high-yielding bank certifi cates of deposit. Sir Robert’s fi nancial activities soon 
began to raise eyebrows among American authorities: his promises of lucrative returns on relatively safe 
certifi cates of deposit were often more than twice the going rate offered by mainstream banks. Stanford’s 
investment opportunities sounded almost too good to be true; unfortunately for investors, they were. Instead 
of the safe investments promised, Stanford secretly used the money in very risky long-term real estate and 
private equity investments. Antiguan auditors did not examine the bank’s portfolio or verify its assets. 
Stanford held these facts from investors who were instead told that their money was totally safe thanks to 
monitoring by a team of more than 20 analysts and yearly audits by Antiguan bank regulators. Before being 
seized by the government, Stanford’s bank had misappropriated $8.5 billion in assets belonging to 30,000 
clients in 131 countries.

442  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
ENTERPRISE CRIMES
Swindlers such as Stanford use their position in the market-
place for illegal gains. Their criminal activities are typically 
ongoing and typically involve groups of people who pro-
vide support, expertise, and so on. Because of their connec-
tion to business and commerce and because they conspire 
to make illegal profi ts, they are referred to here as business 
enterprise crimes.
While we sometimes think of these business-related 
crimes as a new phenomenon, they have been around for 
hundreds of years, ever since the Industrial Revolution 
began. The period between 1750 and 1850 witnessed the 
widespread and unprecedented emergence of financial 
offenses—such as fraud and embezzlement—frequently 
perpetrated by respectable middle-class offenders as the 
banking and commercial systems developed. Where there 
is money, people will steal it, whether it be in the street or 
in the suite.2
In this chapter, we divide these crimes of illicit entrepre-
neurship into two distinct categories: white-collar crime
and green-collar crime. White-collar crime involves illegal 
activities of people and institutions whose acknowledged 
purpose is illegal profi t through legitimate business transac-
tions. Green-collar criminology is concerned with the study 
of environmental harm, environmental laws, and environ-
mental regulation.3
White-collar crime and green-collar crime (also called 
green crime) are linked here because in each category of-
fenders twist legal rules to enhance their personal economic 
position through illicit commercial enterprise. Because they 
are so connected, these two types of crimes may sometimes 
overlap. White-collar criminals may engage in the illegal 
dumping of hazardous waste to increase corporate profi ts; 
green-collar criminals may disguise their acts through elab-
orate corporate structures. Business enterprise crimes taint 
and corrupt the free market system. They mix and match 
illegal and legal methods and products in all phases of com-
mercial activity. They involve illegal business practices (em-
bezzlement, price fi xing, pollution, dumping, bribery, and 
proper handling and disposal of hazardous 
wastes. Before such wastes are released 
into local sewers and wastewater treatment 
plants, EPA rules require that toxic chemi-
cals be treated in order to protect rivers, 
lakes, and streams. This rule was lost on 
Larkin Baggett, who owned and operated 
Chemical Consultants, Inc., in North Salt 
Lake City, Utah, a company that mixed and 
sold chemical products used in the truck-
ing, construction, and concrete industries. 
Between October 2004 and April 2005, 
Baggett illegally dumped pollutants onto 
the ground and into a drain that led to 
the treatment plant operated by the South 
Davis Sewer Improvement District in West 
Bountiful, Utah. The treatment plant had 
a permit to discharge treated effluent to 
the Jordan River, which empties into the 
Great Salt Lake. Baggett instructed his em-
ployees to dispose of industrial wastes by 
dumping them onto the ground and into a 
sanitary sewer drain, which fed directly to 
the wastewater treatment plant. One of the 
wastes, nonylphenol, is a powerful organic 
chemical and heavy-duty industrial cleaner 
that is toxic to aquatic life. Baggett’s actions 
caused the plant to violate permit limits for 
acute toxicity 22 times.
In April 2008, after his indictment for 
violating environmental laws, and two 
months before his trial, Baggett became 
a fugitive. Acting on a tip, EPA agents 
tracked him down to Marathon, Florida, 
and when they attempted to arrest him he 
fought back, assaulting officers. In 2009, 
Baggett was sentenced to 20 years in 
prison for illegally dumping pollutants in 
violation of the federal Clean Water Act and 
the Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act and for assaulting federal officers. 
Baggett’s lengthy sentence is illustrative of 
the tougher treatment being handed down 
for enterprise crimes, especially those in-
volving violence.

positions of trust in business or government to commit 
crimes. Their activities might include pilfering, soliciting 
bribes or kickbacks, and embezzlement. Some white-collar 
criminals set up business for the sole purpose of victimizing 
the general public. They engage in land swindles (i.e., rep-
resenting a swamp as a choice building site), securities theft, 
medical fraud, and so on.
In addition to acting as individuals, some white-collar 
criminals become involved in criminal conspiracies designed 
to improve the market share or profi tability of their corpora-
tions. This type of white-collar crime, which includes anti-
trust violations, price fi xing, and false advertising, is known 
as corporate crime.10
Extent of White-Collar Crime
It is diffi cult to estimate the extent and infl uence of white-
collar crime on victims because all too often those who 
suffer the consequences of white-collar crime are ignored 
by victimologists.11 The most recent national survey con-
ducted by the National White Collar Crime Center found 
the following:12
Victims were urban dwelling, white male Internet users, 
 
■
with high incomes.
Nearly one in two households was victimized by white-
 
■
collar crime within the previous year.
Well over half of respondents indicated victimization 
 
■
over their lifetime.
The type of white-collar victimizations that occur most 
 
■
often are nondelivery and auction fraud.
Increase is seen in crimes involving technology, includ-
 
■
ing credit card fraud.
While many crimes go unreported, about 30 percent 
 
■
report their victimization to law enforcement or another 
crime control agency.
The general public views white-collar crime seriously, 
 
■
calling for increased governmental resource allocations 
to combat these crimes.
It is not surprising, then, that some estimates of the annual 
cost of white-collar crime are as high as $660 billion.13 These 
losses far outstrip the expense of any other type of crime. Nor 
is it likely that the full extent of white-collar crime will ever 
be fully known because many victims (70 percent) are reluc-
tant to report their crime to police, believing that nothing can 
be done and that getting further involved is pointless.14
Beyond the monetary cost, white-collar crime often 
damages property and kills people. Violations of safety 
standards, pollution of the environment, and industrial ac-
cidents due to negligence can be classifi ed as corporate vio-
lence. White-collar crime also destroys confi dence, saps the 
integrity of commercial life, and has the potential for dev-
astating destruction. Think of the possible results if nuclear 
regulatory rules are fl outed or if toxic wastes are dumped 
into a community’s drinking water supply.15
so on) to merchandise what are normally legitimate com-
mercial products (securities, medical care, disposing of 
computer equipment).4
Surprisingly, both forms of enterprise crime can involve 
violence. Hundreds of thousands of occupational deaths oc-
cur each year, many from “corporate violence” such as unsafe 
working conditions; illegal pollution annually kills and injures 
more people than all street crimes combined.5 So while busi-
ness crimes typically involve stealth and fraud, as the Profi les 
in Crime feature shows, they may also include violence.
WHITE-COLLAR CRIME
Scholars have long recognized that some unscrupulous busi-
nesspeople use their position of trust to fl eece the public. 
In 1907, pioneering sociologist Edward Alsworth Ross rec-
ognized the phenomenon when he coined the phrase “the 
criminaloid” to describe the kind of person who hides behind 
his or her image as a pillar of the community and paragon of 
virtue to get personal gain through any means necessary.6
In the late 1930s, the distinguished criminologist Edwin 
Sutherland fi rst used the phrase “white-collar crime” to de-
scribe the criminal activities of the rich and powerful. He 
defi ned white-collar crime as “a crime committed by a per-
son of respectability and high social status in the course of 
his occupation.”7 As Sutherland saw it, white-collar crime 
involved conspiracies by members of the wealthy classes to 
use their position in commerce and industry for personal 
gain without regard to the law. Often these actions were 
handled by civil courts because injured parties were more 
concerned with recovering their losses than with seeing the 
offenders punished criminally. Consequently, Sutherland 
believed that the great majority of white-collar criminals did 
not become the subject of criminological study. Yet the cost 
of white-collar crime is probably several times greater than 
all the crimes customarily regarded as the crime problem. 
And, in contrast to street crimes, white-collar offenses breed 
distrust in economic and social institutions, lower public 
morale, and undermine faith in business and government.8
Defining White-Collar Crime
Although Sutherland’s work is considered a milestone in 
criminological history, his focus was on corporate criminal-
ity, including the crimes of the rich and powerful. Contem-
porary defi nitions of white-collar crime are typically much 
broader and include both middle-income Americans and 
corporate titans who use the marketplace for their criminal 
activity.9 Included within recent views of white-collar crime 
are such acts as income tax evasion, credit card fraud, and 
bankruptcy fraud. Other white-collar criminals use their

world of signed celebrity photos: Truly Unique Collect-
ibles, who through their website made millions of dollars 
selling forged and fraudulent posters, photos, and items. 
Their celebrity-signed pictures and posters were obtained 
by “runners”—people who happen to catch a celebrity at 
an event and obtain a signed picture there. Though run-
ners may have obtained one or two signatures from fa-
mous athletes, they simply forged many more, claiming 
all were genuine. The investigation found that the over-
whelming number of celebrity-signed photographs and 
posters being sold throughout the world are sold under 
this pretense; they are almost all forged.17
Investment Swindles The opening vignette told the 
story of Robert Allen Stanford, a fi nancier whose swindle 
bilked victims out of more than $8 billion. His crimes are 
not unique. In the 1990s, the collapse of the Bank of Credit 
and Commerce International (BCCI) cost depositors an es-
timated $10 billion. BCCI was the world’s seventh largest 
private bank, with assets of about $23 billion. Bank offi -
cials made billions of dollars in loans to confederates who 
had no intention of repaying them; BCCI offi cers also used 
false accounting methods to defraud depositors. The bank’s 
clients included dictators Saddam Hussein and Ferdinand 
Marcos, and the bank helped them launder money, fi nance 
terrorist organizations, and smuggle illegal arms. BCCI of-
fi cers helped Colombian drug cartel leaders launder drug 
money so it could be shifted to legitimate banks.18

of Credit and Commerce International by visiting 
the Criminal Justice CourseMate at cengagebrain.com, 
then accessing the “Web Links” for this chapter.
At the time, no one believed that a swindle of this mag-
nitude could ever occur again; they were wrong. The cre-
ation of global capital markets has created unprecedented 
opportunities for U.S. businesses to access capital and inves-
tors to diversify their portfolios.19 Whether through college 
savings plans or retirement accounts, the number of people 
investing in securities and commodities has increased 600 
percent since 1980.20 This large-scale investment growth, 
however, has also led to signifi cant increases in the amount 
of misconduct seen on Wall Street, and as a result some re-
cent swindles have far exceeded the BCCI scandal. None of 
these is more notorious than the crimes pulled off by fi nan-
cier Bernard Madoff, who had operated Bernard L. Madoff 
Investment Securities, LLC, and created the world’s greatest 
Ponzi scheme (see Exhibit 13.1). His story is told in the 
Profi les in Crime feature.
Madoff’s Ponzi scheme is not unique. There have been 
numerous attempts to fraudulently siphon off clients’ 
money, some so great that they have threatened to collapse 
the world’s fi nancial markets (see Exhibit 13.2).
The National Association of Fraud Investigators 
was established to improve communications and to 
expand the networking of those in investigation of white-
collar crime and related fields, which include but are 
not limited to law enforcement, insurance investigators, 
professional investigators, security specialists, bond 
enforcement agents, attorneys, forensic examiners, tracers/
locators, credit card investigators, auto theft investigators, 
and their international counterparts. For more information,

COMPONENTS OF 
WHITE-COLLAR CRIME
White-collar crime today represents a range of behaviors in-
volving individuals acting alone and within the context of a 
business structure. The victims of white-collar crime can be 
the general public, the organization that employs the offender, 
or a competing organization. There have been numerous at-
tempts to create subcategories or typologies of white-collar 
criminality. The one used here contains seven elements, rang-
ing from an individual using a business enterprise to com-
mit theft-related crimes to an individual using his or her place 
within a business enterprise for illegal gain, to business enter-
prises collectively engaging in illegitimate activity.16
White-Collar Swindles
A white-collar swindle involves the criminal activity of 
people who use a business proposition to fraudulently trick 
others out of their money. As you may recall (Chapter 12), 
fraud is a common-law crime in which someone uses illegal 
methods to bilk another out of money—for example, a per-
son advertises a real Picasso on eBay and the purchaser dis-
covers it to be a forgery. In contrast, white-collar swindles 
involve a person using his or her ongoing institutional or 
business position to commit fraud and fl eece a victim.
This distinction can be seen in the sale of sports 
memorabilia: if a person sells another a baseball alleg-
edly signed by Mickey Mantle and it turns out to be a 
forgery, that is common-law fraud. If they set up an on-
going business, advertise, and then mix forgeries with 
real autographs, that is white-collar fraud. In fact, white-
collar swindles involving the sale of bogus sports memo-
rabilia have become so widespread that the FBI created 
Operation Bullpen, an ongoing effort aimed at stopping 
white-collar swindling in the sports memorabilia indus-
try. One culprit turned out to be the largest seller in the

managing billions in assets. Madoff became 
the darling of the jet set and was trusted by 
many wealthy people, including director Ste-
ven Spielberg, actors John Malkovich, Kevin 
Bacon, and Bacon’s wife Kyra Sedgwick, as 
well as sophisticated financial managers and 
investors. They were taken in by his prom-
ise of high returns and a long track record of 
success. Things went south when the mar-
ket crashed and people wanted their money 
back. It seems the asset management arm 
of his firm was a giant Ponzi scheme. Madoff 
had not invested any of the money he had 
taken in from investors, but instead depos-
ited it in various banks, including New York’s 
Chase Manhattan Bank. He used the inter-
est and principal to pay off investors when 
they wanted to take money out of their ac-
counts, but few did, because they were 
making fantastic paper profits. Madoff, of 
course, convinced them to keep their profits 
in the account rather than ask for a distribu-
tion. When they did ask, his house of cards 
fell apart. More than $30 billion was missing, 
and authorities are still trying to figure out 
where it all went.
When the market melted down in 2007, 
time ran out and it proved impossible for 
Madoff to catch up to the paper profits. He 
finally told his sons what he had done and 
they contacted the FBI. Madoff later claimed 
that he merely wanted to satisfy the expec-
tations of high returns his clients demanded 
and which simply could not be met by legal 
means. Instead, he resorted to an illegal 
scheme involving false trading activities, il-
legal foreign transfers, and false SEC filings. 
He hoped that clients would simply reinvest 
their gains without requesting withdrawals 
until he could figure a way out of investing 
the money and actually making a profit! Ma-
doff admitted he knew his day of reckoning 
was inevitable.
Madoff’s ponzi scheme has been esti-
mated to cost clients an estimated $65 billion, 
maybe the largest criminal conspiracy in his-
tory. He will spend the rest of his life in prison 
while authorities try to find out what happened 
to the cash. In the end, Madoff was regarded 
as the symbol of the greed run amuck that al-
most destroyed the nation’s financial system.

Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, LLC
On March 12, 2009, financier Bernard Ma-
doff pleaded guilty to an 11-count criminal 
complaint charging him with violations of 
the antifraud provisions of the Securities 
Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 
1940. At his hearing, Madoff admitted that 
he had defrauded thousands of investors in 
the nation’s most elaborate financial crime. 
On June 29, 2009, Madoff was sentenced 
to 150 years in prison, a life sentence.
How did Madoff’s scheme unfold? He 
founded the Wall Street firm Bernard L. 
Madoff Investment Securities, LLC, in 1960

What Is a Ponzi Scheme?
A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment 
of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed 
by new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new inves-
tors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to gener-
ate high returns with little or no risk. In many Ponzi schemes, the 
fraudsters focus on attracting new money to make promised pay-
ments to earlier-stage investors and to use for personal expenses, 
instead of engaging in any legitimate investment activity. With little 
or no legitimate earnings, the schemes require a consistent flow 
of money from new investors to continue. Ponzi schemes tend to 
collapse when it becomes difficult to recruit new investors or when 
a large number of investors ask to cash out.
Why are they called “Ponzi schemes”? The term comes 
from one Charles Ponzi, who duped thousands of New England 
residents into investing in a postage stamp speculation scheme 
back in the 1920s. At a time when the annual interest rate for 
bank accounts was 5 percent, Ponzi promised investors that he 
could provide a 50 percent return in just 90 days. Ponzi initially 
bought a small number of international mail coupons in support 
of his scheme, but quickly switched to using incoming funds to 
pay off earlier investors.

446  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
The cornerstone of the crisis was the collapse of the sub-
prime mortgage sector. A subprime mortgage is a home loan 
given to borrowers who, because of their income, would not 
ordinarily qualify for bank loans. Once the subprime loans 
have been issued, the vendors typically bundle them into large 
pools and sell them as securities, a process known as securi-
tization. Because they carry risk, they typically pay a higher 
interest rate than normal securities, making them attractive 
to investors. By 2006, subprimes had grown to 20 percent of 
the mortgage market, up from 2 percent a decade earlier; this 
means an estimated $1.3 trillion of the total $4.5 trillion total 
mortgage loans outstanding is subprime.
While subprime mortgages can help first-time home 
buyers of limited means, they also have been the source of 
Mortgage Swindles
During 2008–2009, the nation was rocked by another form 
of Wall Street fraud that threatened to destroy the fi nancial 
system, the real estate market, and create a 1929-style de-
pression: the collapse of the subprime mortgage system. As 
a result of this fi nancial disaster, several prominent fi nan-
cial institutions, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Broth-
ers, went out of business; banks such as IndyMac Bank and 
Washington Mutual failed, and the federal government was 
forced to provide over a trillion dollars in relief to keep 
other companies such as American Insurance Group (AIG) 
and CitiGroup in business. The American taxpayer will be 
paying for this bailout over the course of their lives.
EXHIBIT 13.2 
Wall Street Swindles
The pyramid scheme.
 
■
 Similar to Ponzi schemes, the money 
collected from newer victims of the fraud is paid to ear-
lier victims to provide a veneer of legitimacy. In pyramid 
schemes, however, the victims themselves are induced to 
recruit further victims through the payment of recruitment 
commissions.
Prime bank scheme.
 
■
 Victims are induced to invest in finan-
cial instruments, allegedly issued by well-known institutions, 
which offer risk-free opportunities for high rates of return—
benefits which are allegedly the result of the perpetrator’s ac-
cess to a secret worldwide exchange ordinarily open only 
to the world’s largest financial institutions.
Advance fee fraud.
 
■
 This category of fraud encompasses a 
broad variety of schemes that are designed to induce their 
victims into remitting up-front payments in exchange for the 
promise of goods, services, and/or prizes. In the securities 
and commodities fraud context, victims are informed that in 
order to participate in a promising investment opportunity, 
they must first pay various taxes and/or fees.
Hedge fund fraud.
 
■
 Hedge funds are private investment 
partnerships that have historically accepted only high–net 
worth clients willing to meet significant minimum invest-
ment thresholds. The industry as a whole has been largely 
unregulated but has become increasingly relevant to mid-
dle-class investors through their exposure to hedge fund 
activities via ancillary investments (e.g., pension funds). 
The relative lack of regulatory scrutiny has made the indus-
try vulnerable to fraud by fund managers, to include over-
statement/misappropriation of fund assets, overcharging for 
fund management fees, insider trading, market timing, and 
late trading.
Commodities fraud.
 
■
 These schemes typically involve the 
deceptive or fraudulent sale of commodities investments. 
False or deceptive sales practices are used to solicit victim 
funds for commodities transactions that either never occur or 
are inconsistent with the original sales pitches. Alternatively, 
commodities market participants may attempt to illegally 
manipulate the market for a commodity by such actions 
as fraudulently reporting price information or cornering 
the market to artificially increase the price of the targeted 
commodity.
Foreign exchange fraud.
 
■
 These schemes are characterized 
by the use of false or deceptive sales practices, alleging high 
rates of return for minimal risk, to induce victims to invest in 
the foreign currency exchange market. The touted transac-
tions either never occur, are inconsistent with the original 
sales pitches, or are executed for the sole purpose of gener-
ating excessive trading commissions in breach of fiduciary 
responsibilities to the victim client.
Broker embezzlement.
 
■
 These schemes involve illicit and 
unauthorized actions by brokers to steal directly from their 
clients. Such schemes may be facilitated by the forging of 
client documents, doctoring of account statements, unau-
thorized trading/funds transfer activities, or other conduct 
in breach of the broker’s fiduciary responsibilities to the 
victim client.
Late-day trading.
 
■
 These schemes involve the illicit purchase 
and sale of securities after regular market hours. Such trading 
is restricted in order to prevent individuals from profiting on 
market-moving information that is released after the close of 
regular trading. Unscrupulous traders attempt to illegally exploit 
such opportunities by buying or selling securities at the market 
close price, secure in the knowledge that the market-moving 
information will generate illicit profits at the opening of trading 
on the following day.

obtain more than $1.5 billion in loan commitments and 
lines of credit. When the fraud was discovered, Mercury’s 
stock price dropped significantly, costing shareholders 
nearly $2 billion in market value. A number of company 
offi cers went to prison, including former chief executive 
offi cer John Brincat, Sr., who pleaded guilty to wire fraud 
and making a false statement to a bank and was sentenced 
to 10 years imprisonment.23
Foreclosure Rescue Scams Not only has the availabil-
ity of subprime mortgages presented opportunities for peo-
ple to commit fraud, but it also created scams designed to 
prey upon people who obtained mortgages and now cannot 
make payments. There have been a variety of foreclosure 
rescue scams:
Phantom help.
 
■
 A desperate homeowner is offered help 
by a supposed “expert” in avoiding foreclosures. He or 
she is then saddled with charges for things the hom-
eowner could have done on his or her own (e.g., calling 
the bank). The phantom helper promises help, collects 
a fee, and never follows through. Soon it’s too late to 
stop the foreclosure from taking place.
Bailout.
 
■
 In this scam, someone offers to bail out the home-
owners by taking the house off their hands with the prom-
ise that they can stay on as renters and buy the house back 
once things have been “fi xed.” The homeowners soon fi nd 
fraud by both borrowers and lenders. 
As opportunities to profit from the 
housing market grew signifi cantly in 
the 1990–2008 period, home build-
ing and ownership were facilitated 
by greedy mortgage lenders as well as 
fraudulent real estate appraisers and 
borrowers. First-time home buyers 
were encouraged to borrow almost the 
full value of their property without re-
gard to their ability to pay back the 
loans. Artifi cial fi nancial instruments 
such as derivatives, and the packag-
ing and sale of mortgages to investors, 
were used to hedge or transfer risks. 
Borrowers provided false information 
to the mortgage broker and/or lender, 
enabling them to get loans for which 
they were not qualified. Those in-
volved in mortgage lending, including 
mortgage brokers, lenders, appraisers, 
underwriters, accountants, real estate 
agents, settlement attorneys, land de-
velopers, investors, builders, bank ac-
count representatives, trust account 
representatives, investment banks, 
and credit rating agencies became in-
volved in criminal fraud to maintain 
or increase their current standard of living. In addition to 
traditional industry conspirators, there have been instances 
involving various organized criminal groups and gang mem-
bers involved in mortgage fraud activity.21
Subprime lenders made risky loans assuming that real 
estate values would always be increasing, allowing borrow-
ers to refinance or sell their properties before going into 
default. However, when sales slowed down in the housing 
market, loan defaults increased and the securities lost value. 
As a result, mortgage companies experienced fi nancial dis-
tress and bankruptcy.22
Desperate for funds, some subprime lenders, in order 
to stave off regulators, engaged in false accounting entries 
and fraudulently infl ated assets and revenues. Some ma-
nipulated their reported loan portfolio risks and used vari-
ous accounting schemes to infl ate their fi nancial reports. 
And in some cases, before these subprime lenders’ stocks 
rapidly declined in value, executives with insider informa-
tion sold their equity positions and profi ted illegally. As a 
result of these practices, some subprime lenders are being 
investigated by federal agencies for corporate fraud and 
insider trading. In one case, offi cers of Mercury Finance 
Company were convicted of intentionally misstating the 
company’s fi nancial records: they falsely reported a profi t 
of more than $120 million instead of a loss of $30 million. 
Executives provided materially false fi nancial statements to 
more than 20 fi nancial institutions, enabling Mercury to

Fabrice Tourre, executive director of structured products group trading with Goldman 
Sachs Group, rubs his eyes during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs 
subcommittee hearing on Wall Street and the financial crisis in Washington, D.C., on April 27, 
2010. Tourre was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud. The SEC alleged 
that Tourre misled investors about Goldman Sachs–backed securities, causing them to lose a 
billion dollars. He and the firm maintain that they never misled investors, and if they did lose 
money it was because of their poor judgment in the marketplace.

out that they can’t buy the house back, and the supposed 
rescuers get most, if not all, of the equity.
Bait and switch.
 
■
 Scammers tell the victim that he or she 
is signing documents for a new loan that will solve his 
or her problems. In reality, the homeowner is signing 
forged documents that transfer ownership of the home, 
which the scammers quickly try to sell to a third party 
at a reduced rate. The victim still owes for the mort-
gage, but will no longer have the asset.24
Builder-Bailout Schemes The housing crisis has also in-
fl uenced home builders to engage in fraud in order to un-
load unsold homes. Builder-bailout schemes occur when a 
builder or developer experiences diffi culty selling his inven-
tory and uses fraudulent means to unload unsold proper-
ties. He may offer a buyer an incentive of a mortgage with 
no down payment in order to get the buyer to buy a house 
he or she could not normally afford. For example, a builder 
wishes to sell a property for $300,000, a price that allows 
him to make a profi t. He infl ates the value of the property 
to $360,000 and fi nds a buyer by offering to give the buyer 
$60,000 to be used as a down payment. The buyer then 
goes to a bank and shows that he or she owes $300,000 on 
a $360,000 property; the lender funds a mortgage loan of 
$300,000, believing that $60,000 was paid to the builder 
and the borrower had the required 20 percent home equity. 
However, the lender is actually funding 100 percent of the 
home’s value. The builder acquires $300,000 from the sale 
of the home and keeps any profi ts. If the home goes into 
foreclosure, the lender who provided the mortgage money 
fi nds out that there was actually no equity in the home and 
loses a fortune.25
In addition to the subprime mortgage scandal, a number 
of other mortgage schemes have been used by unscrupulous 
lenders and borrowers (Exhibit 13.3).
Religious Swindles When oil prices skyrocketed in 2003 
and 2004, one enterprising swindler, Linda Stetler of the Al-
bany, Kentucky-based Vision Oil Company, lured investors 
into risky schemes by claiming that God (and not geolo-
gists) guided her company’s oil exploration: “God gave me a 
vision of three oil wells,” she said in a letter sent to potential 
investors. State regulators found that Stetler and her com-
pany engaged in illegal practices, including inadequate dis-
closures of risks and selling to unsuitable investors. Vision 
Oil and its agents were fi ned by the state and ordered to pay 
restitution to investors.26
Swindlers love to target the religious, taking advantage 
of their hope. It is estimated that fake religious organizations 
bilk thousands of people out of $100 million per year.27 
Swindlers take in worshippers of all persuasions: Jews, Bap-
tists, Lutherans, Catholics, Mormons, and Greek Orthodox 
have all fallen prey to religious swindles. How do religious 
swindlers operate? Some create fraudulent charitable orga-
nizations and convince devout people to contribute to their 
seemingly worthwhile cause. Some use religious television 
EXHIBIT 13.3 
Common Mortgage Fraud Schemes
Illegal property flipping.
 
■
 Property is purchased, falsely 
appraised at a higher value, and then quickly sold. 
What makes property flipping illegal is the appraisal 
information is fraudulent. The schemes typically involve 
one or more of the following: fraudulent appraisals, 
doctored loan documentation, or inflating buyer income. 
Kickbacks to buyers, investors, property/loan brokers, 
appraisers, and title company employees are common in 
this scheme.
Silent second.
 
■
 The buyer of a property borrows the down 
payment from the seller through the issuance of a nondis-
closed second mortgage. The primary lender believes the 
borrower has invested his own money in the down pay-
ment, when in fact it is borrowed. The second mortgage 
may not be recorded to further conceal its status from the 
primary lender.
Nominee loans/straw buyers. 
 
■
The identity of the borrower 
is concealed through the use of a nominee who allows the 
borrower to use the nominee’s name and credit history to 
apply for a loan.
Fictitious/stolen identity. 
 
■
A fictitious/stolen identity may 
be used on the loan application. The applicant may be 
involved in an identity theft scheme: the applicant’s name, 
personal identifying information, and credit history are 
used without the true person’s knowledge.
Inflated appraisals.
 
■
 An appraiser acts in collusion with a 
borrower and provides a misleading appraisal report to the 
lender. The report inaccurately states an inflated property 
value.
Foreclosure schemes. 
 
■
The perpetrator identifies home-
owners who are at risk of defaulting on loans, or whose 
houses are already in foreclosure. Perpetrators mislead the 
homeowners into believing they can save their homes in 
exchange for a transfer of the deed and up-front fees. The 
perpetrator profits from these schemes by remortgaging 
the property or pocketing fees paid by the homeowner.
Equity skimming.
 
■
 An investor may use a straw buyer, false 
income documents, and false credit reports to obtain a 
mortgage loan in the straw buyer’s name. Subsequent to 
closing, the straw buyer signs the property over to the 
investor in a quit claim deed, which relinquishes all rights 
to the property and provides no guaranty to title. The 
investor does not make any mortgage payments, and 
rents the property until foreclosure takes place several 
months later.
Air loans.
 
■
 This is a nonexistent property loan where there 
is usually no collateral. An example of an air loan would 
be where a broker invents borrowers and properties, es-
tablishes accounts for payments, and maintains custodial 
accounts for escrows. The broker may set up an office with 
a bank of telephones, each one used as the employer, ap-
praiser, credit agency, etc., for verification purposes.

including pancreatic and lung cancer, advanced ovarian and 
breast cancer, and AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma. In one 
instance, Courtney provided a doctor with only 450 milli-
grams of Gemzar for a prescription that called for 1,900 mg, 
a transaction that netted him a profit of $779.31 After he 
pleaded guilty, Courtney told authorities that his drug dilu-
tion activities were not limited to the conduct he admitted 
to at the time of his guilty plea. His criminal activities had 
actually begun in 1992 or even earlier, affected the patients 
of 400 doctors, involved 98,000 prescriptions, and harmed 
approximately 4,200 patients.32 There is no telling how 
many people died or suffered serious medical complications 
because of Courtney’s criminal conduct.
Securities Chiseling A great deal of chiseling takes place 
on the commodities and stock markets, where individuals 
engage in deceptive practices that are prohibited by federal 
law.33 Stockbrokers violate accepted practices when they 
engage in churning the client’s account by repeated, exces-
sive, and unnecessary buying and selling of stock.34 Other 
broker fraud includes front running, in which brokers place 
personal orders ahead of a customer’s large order to profi t 
from the market effects of the trade, and bucketing, which 
is skimming customer trading profits by falsifying trade 
information.35 Securities chiseling can also involve using 
one’s position of trust to profi t from inside business infor-
mation, referred to as insider trading. The information can 
then be used to buy and sell securities, giving the trader an 
unfair advantage over the general public, which lacks this 
inside information. As originally conceived, insider trading 
made it illegal for corporate employees with direct knowl-
edge of market-sensitive information to use that informa-
tion for their own benefi t—for example, by buying stock in 
a company that they learn will be taken over by the larger 
concern for which they work. In recent years, the defi ni-
tion of insider trading has been expanded by federal courts 
to include employees of fi nancial institutions, such as law 
or banking fi rms, who misappropriate confi dential infor-
mation on pending corporate actions to purchase stock or 
give the information to a third party so that party may buy 
shares in the company. Courts have ruled that such actions 
are deceptive and violate security trading codes.36 In one 
well-known case, Robert Moffat, a senior executive at IBM, 
pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud for his role 
in passing information to hedge fund managers. His story is 
set out in the Profi les in Crime feature.
White-Collar Exploitation
White-collar exploitation occurs when an individual abuses 
his or her power or position in an organization to coerce 
people into making payments to him or her for services 
to which they are already entitled. If the payments are not 
made, the services are withheld. In most cases, exploitation 
occurs when the victim has a clear right to expect a service, 
and radio shows to sell their products. Others place verses 
from the scriptures on their promotional literature to com-
fort hesitant investors.
Another particularly cruel swindle is to prey upon cou-
ples desperate to adopt children and use religious organi-
zations or local ministries to conduct their scams. In one 
Indiana case, Victoria Farahan approached the director of 
a new local adoption ministry and said she could provide 
healthy newborns from Hospital 31 in Moscow. Couples 
were provided with pictures of the babies (which turned 
out to be pictures of Farahan’s own children). Because the 
scam was run through a religious institution people, took it 
at face value. Before being discovered, Farahan was able to 
bilk couples out $100,000. On July 17, 2006, she pleaded 
guilty to two counts of mail fraud and fi ve counts of wire 
fraud.28
White-Collar Chiseling
White-collar chiseling involves regularly cheating people or 
organizations by deception or deceit. Chiseling schemes de-
prive a buyer or customer of fair treatment by bending the 
rules of reasonable and familiar business practices. Because 
the schemes are so subtle, the victims may not even realize 
they have been cheated.
Chiseling schemes usually involve over-billing or charg-
ing for something that the customer never received, such 
as charging for bogus auto repairs that were not required 
and never performed. It can also involve substituting cheap 
off-brand merchandise for higher priced name brands, or 
short-weighting (intentionally tampering with the accu-
racy of scales used to weigh products) in supermarkets or 
dairies. Take for instance the scandal that rocked New York 
City in 2010 when the Taxi and Limousine Commission re-
voked the licenses of 633 drivers for overcharging custom-
ers as part of a scheme that cost passengers more than a 
million dollars. The commission found that some cab driv-
ers routinely overcharged customers by activating a switch 
that charged them out-of-town rates though the ride had 
taken place within city limits.29 While 633 culprits does not 
sound so bad out of thousands of drivers, the commission 
found that in all, 21,819 taxi drivers had overcharged pas-
sengers a total of 286,000 times; the 633 targeted drivers 
were chronic offenders who had overcharged riders at least 
50 or more times.
Professional Chiseling It is not uncommon for profes-
sionals to use their positions to chisel clients. Pharmacists 
have been known to alter prescriptions or substitute low-
cost generic drugs for more expensive name brands.30 In one 
of the most notorious cases in the nation’s history, Kansas 
City pharmacist Robert R. Courtney was charged with fraud 
when it was discovered that he had been selling diluted mix-
tures of the cancer medications Taxol, Gemzar, Paraplatin, 
and Platinol, which are used to treat a variety of illnesses

they do not make payments, or when judges bully defen-
dants, threatening conviction unless they are paid off. In a 
recent case, Thomas Spargo, a New York state supreme court 
justice, was convicted of extorting money from a lawyer. If 
extortion money was not paid, cases handled by his law fi rm 
and the lawyer’s own personal divorce proceeding would be 
handled in a biased fashion with negative outcomes!38
White-Collar Influence Peddling
On February 18, 2010, Bernard Kerik, former commis-
sioner of the New York City Police, was sentenced to four 
years in prison for accepting gratuities while in offi ce. At 
Kerik’s hearing, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said, “It is a 
very sad day when the former commissioner of the greatest 
police department in the world is sentenced to prison for 
base criminal conduct.” He added, “Today’s sentencing of 
and the offender threatens to withhold the service unless an 
additional payment or bribe is forthcoming. A fi re inspector 
who demands that the owner of a restaurant pay for an op-
erating license is engaging in exploitation.
On the local and state levels, scandals commonly emerge 
in which liquor license board members, food inspectors, 
and fire inspectors are named as exploiters. Exploitation 
can also occur in private industry. Purchasing agents in large 
companies often demand a piece of the action for award-
ing contracts to suppliers and distributors. Managing agents 
in some of New York City’s most luxurious buildings have 
been convicted on charges that they routinely extorted mil-
lions of dollars from maintenance contractors and building 
suppliers. Building managers have been charged with steer-
ing repair and maintenance work to particular contractors 
in exchange for kickbacks totaling millions of dollars.37
Extortion is particularly troubling in the criminal justice 
system when police offi cers threaten victims with arrest if 
next CEO of IBM, become embroiled in a 
securities fraud case that put him behind 
bars?
Moffat was arrested for sharing com-
pany information with billionaire Raj Ra-
jaratnam’s New York hedge fund Galleon 
Group. Moffat provided material and insider 
information relating to IBM, Advanced Mi-
cro Devices, and Lenovo Group Ltd. For his 
role in the scheme, Rajaratnam was also 
charged with insider trading in the stocks 
of several companies, including AMD, 
Clearwire, and Akamai. He allegedly earned 
about $20 million through such trades and 
was charged with giving and receiving non-
public information on companies such as 
Polycom, Hilton Hotels, Google, and People 
Support, and then trading on that informa-
tion. In all, 20 defendants were charged 
with more than $40 million worth of alleged 
insider trading.
Why did Moffat, an up-and-coming and 
extremely wealthy executive, get involved 
in such a scheme? In fact, Moffat didn’t 
make a penny from the information he pro-
vided, nor did he trade a share of stock. 
It seems he became involved with Dan-
ielle Chiesi, a special friend who worked 
for New Castle Partners, an equity hedge 
fund group affiliated with JPMorgan Chase, 
and served as an information gatherer for 
Raj Rajaratnam. Chiesi, a former teenage 
beauty queen, was a woman who used her 
charms to gain business information. “I 
love the three S’s,” she would tell her ex-
ecutive “friends,” “sex, stocks, and sports.” 
On August 22, 2008, during a phone call 
that was intercepted by a government wire-
tap, Moffat provided Chiesi with information 
regarding the timing of an upcoming deal 
involving Advanced Micro; Chiesi used the 
information and materials to illegally ex-
ecute securities transactions. Though to 
be found guilty of insider trading a person 
must somehow profit from using illegal in-
formation, Moffat’s profit was not in cash 
but in terms of the attention and affections 
of an alluring woman.

CHAPTER 13 | Enterprise Crime: White-Collar and Green-Collar Crime  451
Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who announced that he was 
resigning his seat in Congress.42 On November 24, 2010, 
a Texas jury convicted the former congressman of money 
laundering and conspiracy to money launder; he is currently 
appealing his three-year prison sentence. 
Agents of the criminal justice system have also gotten 
caught up in offi cial corruption, a circumstance that is par-
ticularly disturbing because society expects a higher stan-
dard of moral integrity from people empowered to uphold 
the law and judge their fellow citizens. Police offi cers have 
been particularly vulnerable to charges of corruption. Thirty 
years ago, the Knapp Commission found that police cor-
ruption in New York City was pervasive and widespread, 
ranging from patrol offi cers accepting small gratuities from 
local businesspeople to senior offi cers receiving payoffs in 
the thousands of dollars from gamblers and narcotics viola-
tors.43 Despite years of effort to eradicate police corruption, 
instances still abound. In New York City more than 20 of-
fi cers were alleged to have been patrons of prostitutes work-
ing at 335 West 39th Street and a nearby massage parlor; 
some offi cers were fi lmed demanding sex.44
Influence Peddling in Business On August 13, 2010, 
the Apple manager in charge of selecting Asian suppliers, 
Paul Shin Devine, was arrested for disclosing confi dential 
information to suppliers in exchange for payments. The 
information helped the suppliers gain an edge when bid-
ding for Apple’s business. Devine had the suppliers send 
payments to his wife’s bank account to avoid attracting 
 attention; unfortunately for him, he neglected to delete in-
criminating e-mails.45
Bernard Kerik is one of the most powerful 
recent reminders that no one in this coun-
try is above the law.”39
Sometimes individuals holding impor-
tant institutional positions sell power, in-
fl uence, and information to outsiders who 
have an interest in infl uencing the activities 
of the institution or buying information on 
what the institution may do in the future. 
Offenses within this category include gov-
ernment employees taking kickbacks from 
contractors in return for awarding them 
contracts they could not have won on 
merit, or outsiders bribing government of-
fi cials, such as those in the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, who might sell in-
formation about future government activi-
ties. A police offi cer who sells information 
on future raids or takes a bribe in lieu of 
handing out a citation or making an arrest 
is engaging in infl uence peddling.
Though they are somewhat similar, 
influence peddling can be distinguished 
from exploitation. Exploiters force victims 
to pay for services to which they have a 
clear right; they are engaging in extortion. In contrast, infl u-
ence peddlers take bribes in order to use their positions to 
grant favors and sell information to which their co-conspir-
ators are not entitled. In sum, in crimes of exploitation, the 
victim is threatened and forced to pay, whereas the victim of 
infl uence peddling is the organization compromised by its 
employees for their own interests.
Influence Peddling in Government In 2005, Representa-
tive Randy “Duke” Cunningham (R-CA) resigned from Con-
gress after confessing to accepting $2.4 million in bribes, 
including a Rolls-Royce, a yacht, and a nineteenth-century 
Louis-Philippe commode. As he entered his guilty plea at a 
federal courthouse in San Diego, he proclaimed: “In my life, 
I have known great joy and great sorrow. And now I know 
great shame.”40
It has become all too common for elected and appointed 
government officials to be forced to resign or even to be 
jailed for accepting bribes to use their infl uence. The Cun-
ningham case is by no means unique. On April 17, 2006, 
former Governor George Ryan of Illinois was convicted of 
steering government contracts to people who were willing 
to give him kickbacks and bribes. The prosecution said Ryan 
and his family got fancy vacations, money, and other items 
worth at least $167,000, and in return offered special politi-
cal favors and state business in the dozen years he served in 
the state’s top roles.41 On January 3, 2006, infl uential Wash-
ington lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty to three felony 
counts: conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion for bribing pub-
lic offi cials, including Bob Ney, a Republican congressman 
from Ohio. Caught up in the Abramoff scandal was House

Influence peddlers use their position in a firm or the government for their own personal 
benefit. Here, former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik leaves his car to 
enter a New York courthouse. On November 5, 2009, the former “top cop” pleaded 
guilty to eight charges in a plea bargain with prosecutors, who recommended a jail 
sentence of 27 to 33 months. Kerik was sentenced to four years in federal prison on 
February 18, 2010.

goes directly into the hands of the ruling family in exchange 
for privileges).52
White-Collar Pilferage, Embezzlement, 
and Management Fraud
Another type of white-collar crime involves individuals’ 
use of their positions to steal from the company, embezzle 
company funds, or appropriate company property for them-
selves. Here the company or organization that employs the 
criminal, rather than an outsider, is the victim of white-
 collar crime.
Pilferage Is nothing sacred? Three employees and a 
friend allegedly stole moon rocks from a NASA laboratory 
in Houston. FBI agents arrested them after they tried to sell 
the contraband to an undercover agent in Orlando, Florida. 
The would-be seller reportedly asked $2,000 per gram for 
the rocks initially but later bumped the price to $8,000 per 
gram.53 While the theft of moon rocks does not happen very 
often, systematic theft of company property by employees, 
or pilferage, is common.54
While it is diffi cult to estimate how much employee pil-
ferage occurs each year, Hayes International, a loss preven-
tion outfi t, conducts an annual survey of 24 very large retail 
fi rms with over 13,000 stores doing $600 billion in sales. 
The most recent survey found that the number of employ-
ees involved in pilferage is on the rise and so too is the value 
of the merchandise being stolen. Loss prevention efforts 
have helped increase the amount of money recovered from 
dishonest employees:55
One out of every 26 employees was apprehended for 
 
■
theft from their employer in a single year.
Survey participants now apprehend almost 70,000 dis-
 
■
honest employees each year.
Dollars recovered from dishonest employee apprehen-
 
■
sions now total over $50 million each year.
The average dishonest employee case value is more than 
 
■
$700.
Employee theft is most accurately explained by factors 
relevant to the work setting, such as job dissatisfaction and 
the workers’ belief that they are being exploited by employ-
ers or supervisors; economic problems play a relatively small 
role in the decision to pilfer. So, although employers attri-
bute employee fraud to economic conditions and declining 
personal values, workers themselves say they steal because 
of strain and confl ict.
Management Fraud Management-level fraud is also 
quite common. Such acts include converting company as-
sets for personal benefi t; fraudulently receiving increases 
in compensation (such as raises or bonuses); fraudulently 
increasing personal holdings of company stock; retaining 
Politicians and government offi cials are not the only ones 
accused of bribery; business has had its share of scandals. 
People who hold power in a business may force those wish-
ing to work with the company to pay them some form of 
bribe or gratuity to gain a contract. In the building industry, 
a purchasing agent may demand a kickback from contrac-
tors hoping to gain a service contract. Sometimes infl uence 
peddling can benefi t both parties. In the record industry, 
payola is the routine practice of paying radio stations or DJs 
to play songs. While the recording companies are forced to 
pay, they also benefi t from having their recording artists re-
ceive airtime they might not otherwise have gotten. Some 
large companies have been caught in payola scandals; Sony 
records paid $10 million to the state of New York to settle a 
claim that its promoters gave gifts to radio station managers 
to get songs played.46
Business-related bribery is not unique to the United 
States. In some foreign countries, soliciting bribes to do 
business is a common, even expected, practice. In Euro-
pean countries, such as Italy and France, giving gifts to 
secure contracts is a routine practice.47 It is common for 
foreign offi cials to solicit bribes to allow American fi rms to 
do business in their countries. In 2007, German prosecu-
tors in Munich, along with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the Justice Department in the United 
States, charged employees of the giant German industrial 
company Siemens with creating a slush fund worth about 
$520 million in order to make bribes to secure commercial 
contracts abroad.48
In response to these revelations, Congress passed the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which makes it a 
criminal offense to bribe foreign offi cials or to make other 
questionable overseas payments. Violations of the FCPA 
draw strict penalties for both the defendant company and 
its offi cers.49 Moreover, all fi nes imposed on corporate of-
fi cers are paid by them, not absorbed by the company. If a 
domestic company violates the antibribery provisions of the 
FCPA, a domestic corporation can be fi ned up to $1 million. 
Company offi cers, employees, or stockholders who are con-
victed of bribery may have to serve a prison sentence of up 
to fi ve years and pay a $10,000 fi ne.
Despite the penalties imposed by the FCPA, corpora-
tions that deal in foreign trade have continued to give bribes 
to secure favorable trade agreements.50 Schering-Plough 
Corporation agreed to pay a civil penalty of $500,000 for 
violating provisions of the FCPA when it was revealed that 
an employee of its Polish subsidiary made a payment to a 
“charitable foundation” headed by a Polish government of-
fi cial. The government charged that these “charitable” pay-
ments were designed to infl uence the offi cial to purchase 
Schering-Plough’s pharmaceutical products for his region’s 
health fund.51 Other recent cases have involved the Daim-
lerChrysler auto company (which was investigated after it 
was discovered that the fi rm maintained 40 offshore bank 
accounts used to fund the payment of bribes) and oil com-
panies Amerada Hess, Marathon, and Chevron (because of

one’s present position within the company by manipulating 
accounts; and concealing unacceptable performance from 
stockholders.56
Management fraud has involved some of the nation’s 
largest companies and richest people. The Criminological 
Enterprise feature “Tyco, Enron, and WorldCom: Enterprise 
Crime at the Highest Levels” focuses on three of the most 
prominent cases of recent years.
White-Collar Client Fraud
White-collar client fraud is theft by a client from an organi-
zation that advances credit to its clients or reimburses them 
for services rendered. These offenses are linked because they 
involve cheating an organization (such as a government 
agency, bank, or insurance company) with many individual 
clients that the organization supports fi nancially (such as in-
surance policy owners, or loan applicants), reimburses for 
services provided (such as an insurance company who pays 
health care providers), covers losses of (such as claims by 
insurance policyholders), or extends credit to (as the gov-
ernment does to a taxpayer). Included in this category are 
insurance fraud, bank fraud, credit card fraud, fraud related 
to welfare and Medicare programs, and tax evasion.
Health Care Fraud On March 21, 2006, Konstantin Grig-
oryan, his wife, Mayya Leonidovna Grigoryan, and Eduard 
Gersheli, Aleksandr Treynker, and Haroutyun Gulderyan 
were all arrested on charges related to a long-running Medi-
care fraud scheme that federal authorities believe netted 
them at least $20 million. The scheme involved defraud-
ing Medicare, the federal health care program, by billing for 
tests that either were unnecessary or were never performed.
The conspirators paid kickbacks to recruit patients and 
to submit fraudulent billings to Medicare on behalf of medi-
cal service providers, such as medical clinics and diagnostic 
testing centers. The scheme, commonly referred to as “ben-
efi ciary-sharing” or “patient-rotating,” involved “marketers” 
who obtained data about Medicare benefi ciaries and sold 
the information to Medicare providers who then engaged in 
fraudulent billings. Some marketers, known as “cappers,” 
recruited patients with Medicare coverage and brought them 
to clinics where they were given unnecessary medical ser-
vices, including ultrasound examinations and blood tests. 
Once the patients came into a physician’s offi ce, the medical 
providers allegedly billed the patients’ Medicare numbers on 
the dates of their visits and on many other dates—whether 
or not any services were in fact provided to the benefi cia-
ries. The conspirators would fabricate the tests so that the 
patients’ fi les could withstand an audit by Medicare. The 
criminal scheme caused Medicare to pay out at least $20 
million in fraudulent claims from 2000 until 2005. Much 
of the money was deposited into a maze of bank accounts 
of “management” and “consulting” companies, including a 
Panamanian shell corporation with a Swiss account.57
Crooked health care providers fi nd it lucrative to engage 
in fraud in obtaining patients and administering their treat-
ment and for patients to try to scam the system for their 
own benefi t. A recent survey of 52 insurers by the National 
Health Care Antifraud Association (NHCAA) found that 
they annually recover more than $500 million as a direct re-
sult of antifraud activities. While this number is signifi cant, 
it is only a small fraction of the total estimated loss due to 
health fraud. The NHCAA estimates that of the nation’s 
 annual health care outlay, at least 3 percent—or more than 
$50 billion—is lost to outright fraud. Other estimates by 
government and law enforcement agencies place the loss as 
high as 10 percent of annual expenditures—or $170 billion—
lost to fraud each year.58
A central target of medical fraud is the federal Medicaid/
Medicare program. The Offi ce of Inspector General of the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 
6 percent of all Medicaid payments (more than $12 billion) 
should not have been paid due to erroneous billing or pay-
ment, inadequate provider documentation of services to back 
up the claims, or outright fraud.59 One reason that thieves 
fi nd Medicaid/Medicare an inviting target is because it oper-
ates under a system that pays providers fi rst and investigates 
later. The so-called “pay and chase method” gives abusers 90 
days’ lag time to fl eece them for millions before authorities 
are aware a crime has been committed. This system enabled 
Cuban immigrants Carlos, Luis, and Jose Benitez to make and 
get paid for fraudulent claims amounting to $119 million for 
costly HIV drugs that patients never received. After obtaining 
the proceeds from their crimes, the Benitez brothers trans-
ferred millions of dollars in proceeds to sham “marketing” 
and “management” companies they owned and controlled. 
They allegedly fl ed back to Cuba in order to avoid trial.60
Statewide Medicaid systems have also been the target of 
enterprise criminals: New York State offi cials estimate that 
10 percent of the entire program—billions of dollars—has 
been lost due to fraudulent practices.61
There are numerous health care–related schemes. These 
include:
Billing for services that were never rendered by using 
 
■
genuine patient information to fabricate entire claims 
or by adding to claims with charges for procedures or 
services that did not take place.
Billing for more expensive services or procedures than 
 
■
were actually provided or performed, commonly known 
as “upcoding.” This practice requires “infl ation” of the 
patient’s diagnosis code to a more serious condition 
consistent with the false procedure code.
Performing medically unnecessary services solely for 
 
■
the purpose of generating insurance payments. This 
scheme occurs most often in nerve-conduction and 
other diagnostic-testing schemes. Some Southern Cali-
fornia clinics performed unnecessary, and sometimes 
harmful, surgeries on patients who were recruited and 
paid to have these unnecessary surgeries performed.

government fi led suit against some of the nation’s largest 
hospital chains, such as Columbia/HCA Healthcare Cor-
poration (320 hospitals) and Quorum Health Group (250 
hospitals), alleging that they routinely overstated expenses 
to bilk Medicare by fi ling false claims for reimbursement as 
well as paying kickbacks to doctors for referrals.63 HCA, the 
nation’s largest for-profi t hospital chain, pleaded guilty to 
defrauding government health care programs and received 
a combination of civil fi nes and criminal penalties that to-
taled $1.7 billion. The government has attempted to tighten

Misrepresenting noncovered treatments as medically

necessary covered treatments for purposes of obtaining 
insurance payments. This scheme occurs in cosmetic-
surgery in which noncovered cosmetic procedures such 
as nose jobs, tummy tucks, liposuction, or breast aug-
mentations are billed to patients’ insurers as deviated-
septum repairs, hernia repairs, or lumpectomies.62
In addition to individual physicians, some large health 
care providers have been accused of routinely violating 
the law to obtain millions in illegal payments. The federal 
accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Because there was no stealth, there could 
be no embezzlement. However, on Septem-
ber 19, 2005, Kozlowski was convicted of 
looting the company of $150 million and 
sentenced to 8.3 to 25 years in prison.
The Enron Case
Enron Corporation, an oil and gas trading 
firm, was one of the largest companies in 
the United States before it collapsed and 
cost thousands of employees their life sav-
ings and millions of investors their hard-
earned money.
Enron was an aggressive energy com-
pany that sought to transform itself into the 
world’s biggest energy trader. Enron’s share 
price collapsed when word got out that the 
company had been setting up shell com-
panies and limited partnerships to conceal 
debts so they did not show up in the com-
pany’s accounts.
In one incident, six Enron executives ne-
gotiated complex deals in which they made 
at least $42 million on personal investments 
totaling $161,000, all the while knowing 
that the limited partnerships they sold to re-
tirement plans and private foundations were 
collapsing in value. It is also suspected that 
Enron engaged in sham transactions in late 
2000 that drove up electricity prices in Cali-
fornia and helped worsen the energy crisis 
that plagued the West for more than a year.
Enron’s auditors—Arthur Andersen, 
a prestigious accounting firm—actually 
shredded key documents to keep them out 
of the hands of the government. One man 
involved in the incident, David Duncan, a 
former Andersen partner who was head 
of the team that audited Enron, agreed to 
serve as a government witness after plead-
ing guilty to obstruction of justice. Duncan 
admitted in court that he “knowingly, inten-
tionally, and corruptly persuaded and at-
tempted to persuade” Andersen employees 
to withhold records, documents, and other 
objects from an investigation by the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In the aftermath of the Enron collapse, 
key company executives, including chief fi-
nancial officer Andrew Fastow, chief execu-
tive officer Jeffrey Skilling, and chairman 
and CEO Kenneth Lay, were charged with 
conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud, 
bank fraud, and making false statements. 
Skilling and chief accounting officer Rich-
ard Causey were also charged with money 
laundering and conspiracy. The government 
claimed that Lay, Skilling, Fastow, Causey, 
and others oversaw a massive conspiracy 
to delude investors into believing that En-
ron was a growing company when, in fact, it 
was undergoing business setbacks.
The government charges indicate that 
between 1999 and 2001, these executives 
used their position of trust to engage in a 
wide-ranging scheme to deceive the public 
and the SEC about the true performance of 
Enron’s businesses. Their fraud helped in-
flate Enron’s stock price from $30 per share 
in early 1998 to over $80 per share in Jan-
uary 2001. The three allegedly orchestrated 
Tyco, Enron, and WorldCom: Enterprise Crime at the Highest Levels
The Tyco Case
Tyco International Ltd. is a gigantic cor-
porate entity that today operates in all 50 
U.S. states and over 100 countries and em-
ploys more than 250,000 people. Despite 
its great success, the U.S. government in-
dicted Tyco’s chief executive officer, L. Den-
nis Kozlowski, and chief financial officer, 
Marc Swartz, on a variety of fraud and lar-
ceny charges, including misappropriating 
$170 million in company funds by hiding 
unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiv-
ing loans to themselves. Kozlowski and 
Swartz were also accused of making more 
than $430 million by lying about Tyco’s fi-
nancial condition in order to inflate the 
value of their stock.
During their 2004 trial, the government 
tried to establish a motive by showing ju-
rors elements of their extravagant lifestyle. 
Kozlowski spent more than $2 million on a 
party for his wife on the Italian island of Sar-
dinia that featured a performance by singer 
Jimmy Buffett; young men and women 
dressed as Roman soldiers and maidens 
danced and served the guests. He also 
spent $15 million to furnish an $18 mil-
lion Tyco-owned apartment on Fifth Avenue 
in New York City; his expenses included 
a $15,000 umbrella holder, a $2,200 gilt 
metal trash basket, and a $6,000 shower 
curtain.

were merely highly paid executives and 
that everything they received was approved 
by Tyco’s board of directors and their

CHAPTER 13 | Enterprise Crime: White-Collar and Green-Collar Crime  455
It is a crime, punishable by up to fi ve years in prison, to 
provide anything of value, money or otherwise, directly or 
indirectly, with the intent to induce a referral of a patient 
or a health care service. Liability attaches to both parties in 
the transaction—the entity or individual providing the kick-
backs and the individual receiving payment of the referral. 
The law also prohibits physicians and other health care pro-
viders from referring benefi ciaries in federal health care pro-
grams to clinics or other facilities in which the physician or 
health care provider has a fi nancial interest. It is illegal for a 
doctor to refer her patients to a blood-testing lab in which 
for physicians to commit fraud. Health care companies 
providing services to federal health care programs are also 
regulated by federal laws that prohibit kickbacks and self-
referrals. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil-
ity Act of 1996 (HIPAA) established health care fraud as a 
independent federal criminal offense, with the basic crime 
carrying a federal prison term of up to 10 years in addition 
to signifi cant fi nancial penalties.64 HIPAA doubles the prison 
term to up to 20 years should a perpetrator’s fraud result in 
injury to a patient; if the fraud results in a patient’s death, 
the perpetrator can be sentenced to life in federal prison. 
most important elements of the case was 
the more than $400 million that WorldCom 
loaned or guaranteed to loan Ebbers at an 
interest rate of 2.15 percent.
Ebbers began his career by creating the 
LDDS (Long Distance Discount Services), 
which gained many of America’s largest 
corporations as customers for its voice and 
data network. He then bought IDB Com-
pany and renamed it WorldCom. Through 
a series of acquisitions, WorldCom became 
one of the largest Internet hookup and net-
working companies in the United States; its 
stock value increased 7,000 percent during 
the 1990s.
When the market collapsed in 2000, 
WorldCom was heavily in debt and hemor-
rhaging money. While people were being laid 
off, the company made its loans to Ebbers 
so he could hold on to his company stock, 
for which he had taken out loans to pur-
chase. Then on June 25, 2002, WorldCom 
announced that it had illegally treated $3.8 
billion in ordinary costs as capital expendi-
tures. The bottom dropped out of the stock, 
creditors began to sue, and Ebbers was in no 
position to pay back the loans. The company 
admitted to overstating profits by a whop-
ping $74.4 billion between 2000 and 2001, 
including at least $10.6 billion that the firm 
attributed to accounting “errors” as well as 
“improper” and “inappropriate” account-
ing. On May 15, 2005, a federal jury in New 
York convicted Ebbers on all nine counts on 
which he was charged and Ebbers was sen-
tenced to 25 years in prison.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Considering the various theories of 
criminal behavior we have discussed, 
how would you explain the alleged 
behavior of millionaire businesspeople 
such as Bernie Ebbers and Kenneth 
Lay? Are they impulsive? Do they lack 
self-control? Is there a personality deficit 
that can explain their behavior?
 2. Should white-collar criminals be pun-
ished with a prison sentence or would 
society be better served if all their ill-
gotten gains were confiscated?

a series of accounting frauds designed to 
make up the shortfall between what the 
company actually earned and what was 
expected by Wall Street analysts. The gov-
ernment contended that even though the 
company was losing billions of dollars, 
executives continued to maintain that the 
company was doing great and would reach 
its profit targets.
What would motivate the head of one 
of the nation’s largest companies to com-
mit fraud? The most likely reason is greed: 
between 1998 and 2001, Lay received ap-
proximately $300 million from the sale of 
Enron stock options and restricted stock 
and made over $217 million in profit; he 
was also paid more than $19 million in sal-
ary and bonuses. More than 35 individuals 
were charged in connection with Enron’s 
illegal accounting practices. Of these in-
dividuals, 23 have pleaded guilty or been 
convicted, including Fastow, Skilling, and 
former chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay 
(whose conviction was vacated due to his 
death from natural causes). Fastow was 
sentenced to six years in prison for his role 
in the accounting scandal and Skilling was 
sentenced to 24 years and four months in 
prison.

she has an ownership share. These practices—kickbacks 
and self-referrals—are prohibited under federal law because 
they would compromise a medical professional’s indepen-
dent judgment. Congress also mandated the establishment 
of a nationwide Coordinated Fraud and Abuse Control Pro-
gram to coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement 
efforts against health care fraud and to include “the coordi-
nation and sharing of data” with private health insurers.
Health care fraud is expected to continue to rise as peo-
ple live longer and produce a greater demand for Medicare 
benefi ts. In the future, the utilization of long- and short-
term care facilities such as skilled nursing, assisted living, 
and hospice services will expand substantially. Addition-
ally, fraudulent billings and medically unnecessary services 
billed to health care insurers are now prevalent throughout 
the country and are expected to grow in the future.65
Bank Fraud Encompassing such diverse schemes as check 
kiting, check forgery, false statements on loan applications, sale 
of stolen checks, bank credit card fraud, unauthorized use of 
automatic teller machines (ATMs), auto title fraud, and illegal 
transactions with offshore banks, bank fraud can cost billions 
per year.66 Among the schemes used to defraud banks are 
mortgage frauds in which a group of conspirators fraudulently 
obtain loans on overvalued or nonexistent property. Some of 
the more common schemes are set out in Exhibit 13.4.67
To be found guilty of bank fraud, one must knowingly 
execute or attempt to execute a scheme to fraudulently ob-
tain money or property from a fi nancial institution. A car 
dealer would commit bank fraud by securing loans on titles 
to cars it no longer owned. A real estate owner would be 
guilty of bank fraud if he or she obtained a false appraisal 
on a piece of property with the intention of obtaining a 
bank loan in excess of the property’s real worth. Penalties 
for bank fraud include a maximum fi ne of $1 million and 
up to 30 years in prison.
Tax Evasion Another important aspect of client fraud 
is tax evasion. Here the victim is the government that is 
cheated by one of its clients, the errant taxpayer to whom 
it extended credit by allowing the taxpayer to delay paying 
taxes on money he or she had already earned. Tax fraud is 
a particularly challenging area for criminological study be-
cause so many U.S. citizens regularly underreport their in-
come, and it is often diffi cult to separate honest error from 
deliberate tax evasion.
The basic law on tax evasion is contained in the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Code, section 7201, which states:
Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to 
evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the 
payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties 
provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon convic-
tion thereof, shall be fi ned not more than $100,000 or 
imprisoned not more than fi ve years, or both, together 
with the costs of prosecution.
EXHIBIT 13.4
Some Common Bank Fraud Schemes
Prime bank investment fraud.
 
■
 In these schemes, victims 
are told that certain financial instruments (notes, letters of 
credit, debentures, or guarantees) have been issued by well-
known institutions such as the World Bank and offer a risk-
free opportunity with high rates of return. Perpetrators often 
claim that the unusually high rates of return and low risk are 
the result of a worldwide secret exchange open only to the 
world’s largest financial institutions. Victims are often drawn 
into prime bank investment frauds because the criminals 
use sophisticated terms, legal looking documents, and claim 
that the investments are insured against loss.
Advanced fee schemes.
 
■
 In these scams, victims are per-
suaded to advance relatively small sums of money in the 
hope of realizing a much larger gain. In securities fraud, 
victims are told that in order to have the opportunity to be an 
investor in an initial offering of a promising security, invest-
ment (business or land development), or commodity, the 
victim must first send funds to cover taxes or processing fees.
Hedge fund fraud.
 
■
 Hedge funds (HFs) are private invest-
ment partnerships that routinely accept only high wealth 
clients willing to invest at least hundreds of thousands 
of dollars. Historically, these high wealth investors were 
deemed “financially sophisticated,” and, as a result, HFs 
have been unregulated and are not required to register 
with any federal or state regulatory agency. More recently, 
many middle-class investors have been exposed to HFs 
through ancillary investments such as pensions and en-
dowments. There are over 8,800 HFs currently operating, 
with over $1.3 trillion in assets under management.
To prove tax fraud, the government must fi nd that the 
taxpayer either underreported his or her income or did not 
report taxable income. No minimum dollar amount is stated 
before fraud exists, but the government can take legal action 
when there is a “substantial underpayment of tax.” A second 
element of tax fraud is “willfulness” on the part of the tax 
evader. In the major case on this issue, willfulness was de-
fi ned as a “voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal 
duty and not the careless disregard for the truth.”68 Finally, 
to prove tax fraud, the government must show that the tax-
payer has purposely attempted to evade or defeat a tax pay-
ment. If the offender is guilty of passive neglect, the offense 
is a misdemeanor. Passive neglect means simply not paying 
taxes, not reporting income, or not paying taxes when due. 
On the other hand, affi rmative tax evasion, such as keeping 
double books, making false entries, destroying books or re-
cords, concealing assets, or covering up sources of income, 
constitutes a felony.

the corporation but is nonetheless within the scope of the 
employee’s authority.72
Some of the acts included within corporate crime are 
price fi xing and illegal restraint of trade, false advertising, 
and the use of company practices that violate environmental 
protection statutes. The variety of crimes contained within 
this category is great, and they cause vast damage. The fol-
lowing subsections examine some of the most important 
offenses.
Illegal Restraint of Trade and Price Fixing A restraint 
of trade involves a contract or conspiracy designed to stifl e 
competition, create a monopoly, artifi cially maintain prices, 
or otherwise interfere with free market competition.73 The 
control of restraint of trade violations has its legal basis in 
the Sherman Antitrust Act, which subjects to criminal or 
civil sanctions any person “who shall make any contract or 
engage in any combination or conspiracy” in restraint of 
interstate commerce.74 For violations of its provisions, this 
federal law created criminal penalties of up to three years 
imprisonment and $100,000 in fines for individuals and 
$10 million in fines for corporations.75 The act outlaws 
conspiracies between corporations designed to control the 
marketplace.
In most instances, the act lets the presiding court judge 
whether corporations have conspired to “unreasonably re-
strain competition.” However, four types of market con-
ditions are considered so inherently anticompetitive that 
federal courts, through the Sherman Antitrust Act, have de-
fi ned them as illegal per se, without regard to the facts or 
circumstances of the case:
Division of markets.
 
■
 Firms divide a region into territo-
ries, and each fi rm agrees not to compete in the others’ 
territories.
Tying arrangement.
 
■
 A corporation requires customers of 
one of its services to use other services it offers. For ex-
ample, it would be an illegal restraint of trade if a rail-
road required that companies doing business with it or 
supplying it with materials ship all goods they produce 
on trains owned by the rail line.76
Group boycott.
 
■
 An organization or company boycotts re-
tail stores that do not comply with its rules or desires.
Price fi xing.
 
■
 A conspiracy to set and control the price of 
a necessary commodity is considered an absolute viola-
tion of the act.
Deceptive Pricing Even the largest U.S. corporations 
commonly use deceptive pricing schemes when they re-
spond to contract solicitations. Deceptive pricing occurs 
when contractors provide the government or other corpo-
rations with incomplete or misleading information on how 
much it will actually cost to fulfi ll the contracts on which 
they are bidding or use mischarges once the contracts are 
signed.77 For example, defense contractors have been pros-
ecuted for charging the government for costs incurred on 
Although tax cheating is a serious crime, the great ma-
jority of major tax cheats (in some categories, four out of 
fi ve cheaters) are not prosecuted because the IRS lacks the 
money to enforce the law.69 Today, the IRS collects more than 
$2 trillion in revenue and processes more than 224 million 
tax returns. However, its budget amounts to only 44 cents 
for each $100 it collects; this is 10 percent less, after adjust-
ing for infl ation, than in 1997. In addition, because most 
IRS resources are devoted to processing tax returns, there is 
less money for audits, investigations, and collections than 
there was a decade ago. In 1997, the IRS conducted more 
than 5,000 tax fraud and other investigations; in 2006, the 
number dropped to less than 4,000. Not surprisingly, the 
number of people sentenced for tax evasion and other fi -
nancial crimes dropped from 3,000 to 2,000 during this 
span. The problem of tax fraud is signifi cant, and honest 
taxpayers are forced to bear the costs, which may run into 
the hundreds of billions.
Corporate Crime
Yet another component of white-collar crime involves situa-
tions in which powerful institutions or their representatives 
willfully violate the laws that restrain these institutions from 
doing social harm or require them to do social good. This is 
also known as corporate or organizational crime.
Interest in corporate crime first emerged in the early 
1900s, when a group of writers, known as muckrakers, 
targeted the monopolistic business practices of John D. 
Rockefeller, and other corporate business leaders. In a 1907 
article, sociologist E. A. Ross described the “criminaloid”: 
a business leader who while enjoying immunity from the 
law victimized an unsuspecting public.70 Edwin Sutherland 
focused theoretical attention on corporate crime when he 
began his research on the subject in the 1940s; corporate 
crime was probably what he had in mind when he coined 
the phrase “white-collar crime.”71
Corporate crimes are socially injurious acts commit-
ted by people who control companies to further their busi-
ness interests. The target of their crimes can be the general 
public, the environment, or even company workers. What 
makes these crimes unique is that the perpetrator is a legal 
fi ction—a corporation—and not an individual. In reality, it 
is company employees or owners who commit corporate 
crimes and who ultimately benefi t through career advance-
ment or greater profi ts. For a corporation to be held crimi-
nally liable, the employee committing the crime must be 
acting within the scope of his employment and must have 
actual or apparent authority to engage in the particular act 
in question. Actual authority occurs when a corporation 
knowingly gives authority to an employee; apparent au-
thority is satisfi ed if a third party, such as a customer, rea-
sonably believes the agent has the authority to perform the 
act in question. Courts have ruled that actual authority may 
occur even when the illegal behavior is not condoned by

4 million workers are injured and 4,000 killed on the job. 
Some industries have been hit particularly hard by com-
plaints and allegations. The control of workers’ safety has 
been the province of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA). OSHA sets industry standards for 
the proper use of such chemicals as benzene, arsenic, lead, 
and coke. Intentional violation of OSHA standards can re-
sult in criminal penalties.

WHITE-COLLAR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS
The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives the 
federal government the authority to regulate white-collar 
crime. Detection and enforcement are primarily in the 
hands of administrative departments and agencies, includ-
ing the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Ser-
vice, U.S. Customs, the Environmental Protection Agency, 
and the Securities and Exchange Commission.80 The deci-
sion to pursue criminal rather than civil violations usually 
is based on the seriousness of the case and the perpetra-
tor’s intent, actions to conceal the violation, and prior 
record. Enforcement generally is reactive (generated by 
complaints) rather than proactive (involving ongoing in-
vestigations or the monitoring of activities). Investigations 
are carried out by the various federal agencies and the 
FBI. If criminal prosecution is called for, the case will be 
handled by attorneys from the criminal, tax, antitrust, and 
civil rights divisions of the Justice Department. If insuf-
fi cient evidence is available to warrant a criminal prosecu-
tion, the case will be handled civilly or administratively by 
some other federal agency. The Federal Trade Commission 
can issue a cease and desist order in antitrust or merchan-
dising fraud cases.
The number of state-funded technical assistance offi ces 
to help local prosecutors has increased signifi cantly; more 
than 40 states offer such services. On the state and local 
levels, law enforcement officials have made progress in a 
number of areas, such as controlling consumer fraud. The 
Environmental Crimes Strike Force in Los Angeles County, 
California, is considered a model for the control of ille-
gal dumping and pollution.81 Some of the more common 
work they are doing for private fi rms or shifting the costs 
on fi xed-price contracts to ones in which the government 
reimburses the contractor for all expenses (“cost-plus” 
contracts). One well-known example of deceptive pricing 
occurred when the Lockheed Corporation withheld infor-
mation that its labor costs would be lower than expected 
on the C-5 cargo plane. The resulting overcharges were an 
estimated $150 million. Although the government was able 
to negotiate a cheaper price for future C-5 orders, it did not 
demand repayment on the earlier contract.78
False Claims Advertising Executives in even the largest 
corporations sometimes face stockholders’ expectations of 
ever-increasing company profi ts that seem to demand that 
sales be increased at any cost. At times executives respond 
to this challenge by making claims about their products that 
cannot be justified by actual performance. However, the 
line between clever, aggressive sales techniques and fraudu-
lent claims is fi ne. It is traditional to show a product in its 
best light, even if that involves resorting to fantasy. It is not 
fraudulent to show a delivery service vehicle taking off into 
outer space or to imply that taking one sip of beer will make 
people feel they have just jumped into a freezer. However, 
it is illegal to knowingly and purposely advertise a product 
as possessing qualities that the manufacturer realizes it does 
not have, such as the ability to cure the common cold, grow 
hair, or turn senior citizens into rock stars (though some 
rock stars are senior citizens these days).
In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Illinois 
Ex Rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Associates, helped define 
the line separating illegal claims from those that are artistic 
hyperbole protected by free speech.79 Telemarketing Associ-
ates, a for-profi t fundraising corporation, was retained by a 
charity to solicit donations to aid Vietnam veterans in the 
state of Illinois. Though donors were told that a signifi cant 
portion of the money would go to the vets, the telemarket-
ers actually retained 85 percent of all the money collected. 
The Illinois attorney general fi led a complaint in state court, 
alleging that such representations were knowingly deceptive 
and materially false. The telemarketers said they were exer-
cising their First Amendment free speech rights when they 
made their pitch for money.
The Supreme Court disagreed and found that states 
may charge fraud when fundraisers make false or mislead-
ing representations designed to deceive donors about how 
their donations will be used. The Court held that it is false 
and misleading for a solicitor to fool potential donors into 
believing that a substantial portion of their contributions 
would fund specifi c programs or services, knowing full well 
that was not the case.
Worker Safety Violations Some corporations have endan-
gered the lives of their own workers by maintaining unsafe 
conditions in their plants and mines. It has been estimated 
that more than 20 million workers have been exposed 
to hazardous materials while on the job. Each year about

society’s success stories, by the rich and the powerful, and 
frequently have no visible victim at their root. Both the pub-
lic and the justice system have had trouble distinguishing 
criminal fraud from mere lawful exaggeration, tax evasion 
from “tax avoidance,” insider trading from “savvy investing,” 
obstruction of justice from “zealous advocacy,” bribery from 
“horse trading,” and extortion from “hard bargaining.”87
Hence, white-collar criminals are treated more leniently 
than lower-class offenders, the topic of the Thinking Like a 
Criminologist feature.
There have also been charges that efforts to control 
white-collar crime are biased against specific classes and 
races: authorities seem to be less diligent when victims are 
poor or minority group members or the crimes take place 
in minority areas. When Michael Lynch and his associates 
studied petroleum refi neries’ law violations, they found that 
those polluting black, Latino, and low-income communities 
receive smaller fi nes than those refi neries in white and af-
fl uent communities. They also found that violations of the 
Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and/or the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act in minority areas received 
much smaller fi nes than the same types of violations occur-
ring in white areas ($108,563 versus $341,590).88
The prevailing wisdom, then, is that many white-collar 
criminals avoid prosecution, and those that are prosecuted 
receive lenient punishment. What efforts have been made to 
bring violators of the public trust to justice? White-collar crimi-
nal enforcement typically involves two strategies designed to 
control organizational deviance: compliance and deterrence.89
Compliance Strategies Compliance strategies aim for 
law conformity without the necessity of detecting, process-
ing, or penalizing individual violators. At a minimum, they 
ask for cooperation and self-policing among the business 
environmental offenses investigated and prosecuted by the 
task force include:
The illegal transportation, treatment, storage, 
 
■
or disposal of hazardous waste
Oil spills
 
■
Fraudulent certifi cation of automobile smog tests
 
■
82
Nonetheless, while local agencies recognize the serious-
ness of enterprise-type crimes, they rarely have the funds nec-
essary for effective enforcement.83 Local prosecutors pursue 
white-collar criminals more vigorously if they are part of a 
team effort involving a network of law enforcement agen-
cies.84 National surveys of local prosecutors fi nd that many 
do not consider white-collar crimes particularly serious prob-
lems. They are more willing to prosecute cases if the offense 
causes substantial harm and if other agencies fail to act. Rela-
tively few prosecutors participate in interagency task forces 
designed to investigate white-collar criminal activity.85
Controlling White-Collar Crime
In years past, it was rare for a corporate or white-collar 
criminal to receive a serious criminal penalty.86 White-collar 
criminals are often considered nondangerous offenders be-
cause they usually are respectable older citizens who have 
families to support. These “pillars of the community” are 
not seen in the same light as a teenager who breaks into 
a drugstore to steal a few dollars. Their public humiliation 
at being caught is usually deemed punishment enough; a 
prison sentence seems unnecessarily cruel.
The main reason, according to legal expert Stuart Green, 
is that perception of white-collar crime is clouded by moral 
ambiguity. White-collar crimes are typically committed by 
You may recall that style guru Martha Stewart was 
imprisoned as a result of an investigation into an 
insider trading scheme. The case caused quite a 
bit of controversy since Martha did not present a 
danger to society and she was never convicted 
of insider trading but to the charge of lying to 
federal investigators. As trial attorney Kevin Ma-
honey puts it:
It is a shameful day. The federal govern-
ment will imprison a woman for lying to its 
investigators. Not a lie that stampeded a 
country into an unnecessary war, that defrauded the country in 
millions of dollars, or endangered people’s lives. The lie was no 
more than the denial of wrongdoing, a protestation of innocence. 
Shame on us for permitting our government to terrorize us.
Yet the people who were shocked when 
Stewart did time for some vague white-collar 
offense seem to have no problem with im-
prisoning a lower-class woman who had been 
caught possessing drugs. Even though both 
crimes had no discernible victim, Martha’s 
white-collar crime seemed like the more trivial 
offense . . . or did it?
❯❯ Divide the class/group into sections and 
debate this issue: Is it ethical to imprison 
non-dangerous white-collar criminals to set 
an example or should they merely suffer financial penalties? 
What is the purpose of putting someone like Martha Stewart in 
prison for some trivial white-collar offense?

460  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
In sum, compliance strategies attempt to create a market-
place incentive to obey the law. Compliance strategies avoid 
punishing, stigmatizing, and shaming businesspeople by focus-
ing on the act, rather than the actor, in white-collar crime.93
Deterrence Strategies Some criminologists say that the 
punishment of white-collar crimes should include a retribu-
tive component similar to that used in common-law crimes. 
White-collar crimes, after all, are immoral activities that 
have harmed social values and deserve commensurate pun-
ishment.94 Even the largest fi nes and penalties are no more 
than a slap on the wrist to multibillion-dollar companies. 
Corporations can get around economic sanctions by moving 
their rule-violating activities overseas, where legal controls 
over injurious corporate activities are lax or nonexistent.95 
They argue that the only way to limit white-collar crime is 
to deter potential offenders through fear of punishment.
Deterrence strategies involve detecting criminal violations, 
determining who is responsible, and penalizing the offenders 
to deter future violations.96 Deterrence systems are oriented 
toward apprehending violators and punishing them rather 
than creating conditions that induce conformity to the law.
Deterrence strategies should work—and they have— 
because white-collar crime by its nature is a rational act whose 
perpetrators are extremely sensitive to the threat of criminal 
sanctions. Perceptions of detection and punishment for white-
collar crimes appear to be powerful deterrents to future law 
violations. Although deterrence strategies may prove effective, 
federal agencies have traditionally been reluctant to throw 
corporate executives in jail. The government seeks criminal 
indictments in corporate violations only in “instances of out-
rageous conduct of undoubted illegality,” such as price fi x-
ing.97 The government has also been lenient with companies 
and individuals that cooperate voluntarily after an investiga-
tion has begun; leniency is not given as part of a confession 
or plea arrangement. Those who comply with the leniency 
policy are charged criminally for the activity reported.98
Is the Tide Turning?
Despite years of neglect, there is growing evidence that 
white-collar crime deterrence strategies have become nor-
mative. In one important case, Adelphia cable operator John 
Rigas was sentenced to 15 years in prison for bank and se-
curities fraud, and his son Timothy Rigas was sentenced to 
20 after their conviction on charges that they used company 
funds to support their extravagant lifestyle. John Rigas took 
advantage of a shared line of credit with Adelphia, using 
the company’s money—stockholders’ money—for personal 
extravagances.99
This get-tough deterrence approach appears to be af-
fecting all classes of white-collar criminals. Although many 
people believe affl uent corporate executives usually avoid se-
rious punishment, public displeasure with such highly pub-
licized white-collar crimes may be producing a backlash that 
community. Compliance systems attempt to create confor-
mity by giving companies economic incentives to obey the 
law. They rely on administrative efforts to prevent unwanted 
conditions before they occur. Compliance systems depend 
on the threat of economic sanctions or civil penalties to con-
trol corporate violators.
One method of compliance is to set up administrative 
agencies to oversee business activity. The Securities and Ex-
change Commission regulates Wall Street activities, the Food 
and Drug Administration regulates drugs, cosmetics, medi-
cal devices, meats, and other foods, and the Environmental 
Protection Agency regulates pollution, dumping, and so on. 
The legislation creating these agencies usually spells out the 
penalties for violating regulatory standards. This approach 
has been used to control environmental crimes by levying 
heavy fi nes based on the quantity and quality of pollution 
released into the environment.90 It is easier and less costly to 
be in compliance, the theory goes, than to pay costly fi nes 
and risk criminal prosecution for repeat violations. More-
over, the federal government bars people and businesses 
from receiving government contracts if they have engaged in 
repeated business law violations.
When compliance fails, and businesspeople violate the 
law, the institution rather than its individual employees are 
punished. In 2006, for example, employees of the Longley 
Jones real estate management company illegally removed and 
disposed of asbestos in 98 buildings they owned or managed. 
Longley Jones was charged with one count of conspiracy and 
seven counts of violating the Clean Air Act. The sentence: 
the company paid a $3,200 special assessment and a $4 mil-
lion fi ne, $3 million of which was suspended if it cleaned up 
the asbestos at various Longley Jones facilities.91 Compliance 
rather than punishment is the goal of the court order.
Another compliance approach is to force corporate 
boards to police themselves and take more oversight respon-
sibility. In the wake of the Enron and WorldCom debacles, 
the federal government enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) 
legislation in 2002 to combat fraud and abuse in publicly 
traded companies.92 This law limits the nonaudit services 
auditing fi rms can perform for publicly traded companies 
in order to make sure accounting fi rms do not fraudulently 
collude with corporate officers; as well, it places greater 
responsibilities on boards to preserve an organization’s in-
tegrity and reputation, primarily for U.S. publicly traded 
companies. It also penalizes any attempts to alter or falsify 
company records in order to delude shareholders:
Sec. 802(a) Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, muti-
lates, conceals, covers up, falsifi es, or makes a false entry 
in any record, document, or tangible object with the in-
tent to impede, obstruct, or infl uence the investigation or 
proper administration of any matter within the jurisdic-
tion of any department or agency of the United States or 
any case fi led under title 11, or in relation to or contem-
plation of any such matter or case, shall be fi ned under 
this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

with a misdemeanor for negligent conduct, or a felony if 
there is evidence that company personnel knowingly en-
gaged in conduct risking injury. It would be a criminal 
act if, for example, employees of BP or its subcontractors,

To prove a felony, and potentially put BP executives in 
prison, the government must show that company offi cials 
knew in advance that its actions would lead to the explosion 
is resulting in more frequent use of prison 
sentences.100 With the Madoff scandal de-
priving so many people of their life savings, 
the general public has become educated as to 
the damage caused by white-collar criminals 
and may now consider white-collar crimes 
as more serious offenses than common-law 
theft offenses.
Considering this changing vision, it is not 
surprising that the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice Antitrust Division is now vigorously pur-
suing increased jail time for violators as well 
as more punitive fi nancial penalties. The di-
vision has signifi cantly increased the amount 
of fi nes it has collected, from $75 million in 
2002 to more than $500 million today. 
Some commentators now argue that the 
government may actually be going over-
board in its efforts to punish white-collar 
criminals, especially for crimes that are the 
result of negligent business practices rather 
than intentional criminal conspiracy.101 The 
U.S. Sentencing Commission has voted to 
increase penalties for high-dollar fraud and 
theft offenses.102 While the Sherman Anti-
trust Act caps fi nes at $10 million, the com-
mission’s penalties are far more severe. Under 
these guidelines, corporations convicted of antitrust felonies 
may result in fi nes equal to the greater of twice the corpora-
tion’s illegal fi nancial gain or twice the victim’s loss; as a result, 
both fi nes and penalties have been increasing.
Since 1999, Florida’s Department of Environmental 
Protection has fielded a multiagency strike force—
led by the department’s Division of Law Enforcement—to

hazardous material statewide. To learn more, visit the

GREEN-COLLAR CRIME
On April 20, 2010, an explosion occurred on the Deepwa-
ter Horizon oil rig, killing11 platform workers and injuring 
17 others.103 The rig was built by Hyundai Heavy Indus-
tries of Korea, owned by the Transocean Drilling Corpora-
tion, the drilling overseen by Halliburton, and leased by BP 
(formerly British Petroleum), in order to drill a deepwater 
(5,000 feet below the surface) well in the Gulf of Mexico. At 
fi rst, estimates of the spill were 5,000 barrels a day, but they 
quickly rose to 60,000. While company offi cials frantically

On June 3, 2010, a brown pelican covered in oil sits on the beach at East Grand Terre 
Island along the Louisiana coast in the wake of the BP Deepwater Horizon rig explosion. 
A permanent cement plug sealed BP’s well nearly 2.5 miles below the sea floor in the 
Gulf of Mexico, five agonizing months after an explosion sank a drilling rig and led to the 
worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Not only were birds, turtles, and fish killed, the spill 
also damaged grasses that grow on the coast of Louisiana that are crucial to the 
ecosystem. The oil kills the grass and animals both by releasing poisonous chemicals 
and by coating them, which causes suffocation.

as laws designed to protect nature and the environment 
(the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and so on).
Environmental justice.
 
■
 According to the environmental 
justice view, limiting environmental crimes to actual 
violations of the criminal law is too narrow. A great deal 
of environmental damage occurs in third-world nations 
desperate for funds and willing to give mining and oil 
companies a free hand to develop resources. These na-
tions have meager regulatory laws and therefore allow 
businesses wide latitude in environmental contamina-
tion that would be forbidden in the United States. In 
addition, environmental justice advocates believe that 
corporations themselves have attempted to co-opt or 
manipulate environmental laws, thereby limiting their 
scope and reach. Executives fear that the environmental 
movement will force changes in their production prac-
tices and place limits on their growth and corporate 
power. Some have tried to co-opt green laws by public 
relations and advertising campaigns that suggest they 
are doing everything in their power to respect the en-
vironment, thereby reducing the need for government 
regulation. Criminologists must take a broader view of 
green crimes than the law allows.
Biocentric.
 
■
 According to the biocentric approach, environ-
mental harm is viewed as any human activity that dis-
rupts a biosystem, destroying plant and animal life. This 
more radical approach would criminalize any intentional 
or negligent human activity or manipulation that impacts 
negatively on the earth’s natural resources, resulting in 
trauma to those resources.109 Environmental harm, ac-
cording to this view, is much greater than what is defi ned 
by law as environmental crimes. As criminologist Rob 
White points out, this is because some of the most eco-
logically destructive activities, such as clear felling of old-
growth forests, are quite legal. Environmental crimes are 
typically oriented toward protecting humans and their 
property and have a limited interest in the interests of 
animals and plants.110 Environmental laws protect animal 
and fi sh processing plants that treat “nature” and “wild-
life” simply and mainly as resources for human exploita-
tion. Human beings are the cause of environmental harm 
and need to be controlled.
Forms of Green Crime
Green-collar crime can take may different forms, ranging 
from deforestation and illegal logging to violations of worker 
safety. A few of the most damaging forms are set out below.
Illegal Logging Illegal logging involves harvesting, pro-
cessing, and transporting timber or wood products in 
violation of existing laws and treaties.111 It is a universal 
phenomenon, occurring in major timber-producing coun-
tries, especially in the third world where enforcement is lax. 
Logging violations include taking trees in protected areas 
and oil spill but chose to ignore the danger; a misdemeanor 
requires only mere negligence. But even a misdemeanor 
conviction would amp up the loss to the company, because 
the Federal Alternative Fines Act allows the government 
to request monetary fi nes that are twice the loss associated 
with an offense.105 This provision can also have a devastat-
ing  effect on employees, because fi nes imposed on individu-
als under the act may not be paid by their employer.106 A 
criminal conviction would cost BP more than $60 billion. It 
would also mean that the company would be prevented from 
having future sales contracts with the government. Finally, 
lying to the government during the investigation could bring 
additional common-law charges of making false statements, 
obstruction of justice, and conspiracy. At this time, the case 
has not been resolved.
While some may argue that it is overly harsh to put com-
pany executives in prison for what is essentially an accident, 
civil penalties do not seem to deter companies such as BP. Be-
fore the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, BP had already paid hundreds 
of millions in civil penalties for similar if lesser disasters. One 
fi ne of $87 million was paid to the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration—the largest fi ne in OSHA’s history—
for a Texas refi nery explosion; an additional $50 million was 
paid to the Department of Justice for the same explosion. BP 
also paid $3 million to OSHA for 42 safety violations at an 
Ohio refi nery and was fi ned $20 million by the Department 
of Justice for another spill that violated the Clean Water Act.
Oil spills are just part of the green crime problem. Envi-
ronmental activists have long called attention to a variety of 
ecological threats that they feel should be deemed criminal. 
Green crimes involve a wide range of actions and outcomes 
that harm the environment and that stem from decisions 
about what is produced, where it is produced, and how it 
is produced.107 Global warming, overdevelopment, popula-
tion growth, and other changes will continue to bring these 
issues front and center.108
While crimes targeting the environment have received 
scant attention in the criminological literature, recent events 
have shifted attention to what is variously called green 
crime, green criminology, and green-collar crime. The Gulf 
Coast disaster in 2010 is a powerful and tragic example of 
how environmental destruction and green crimes may be 
linked to enterprise systems: the need for corporate profi t 
may outweigh attention to safety, with subsequent cata-
strophic consequences.
Defining Green Crime
There is no single vision to define the concept of green 
crimes. Three independent views exist:
Legalist

. According to the legalist perspective, environ-
mental crimes are violations of existing criminal laws 
designed to protect people, the environment or both.

such as occupational health and safety crimes, as well

the most vulnerable forest regions—southeast Asia, central 
Africa, South America, and Russia—may be conducted ille-
gally. Worldwide, estimates suggest that illegal activities may 
account for over a tenth of the total global timber trade, rep-
resenting products worth at least $15 billion per year.
Illegal Wildlife Exports The smuggling of wildlife across 
national borders is a serious matter.113 Exporters fi nd a lu-
crative trade in the demand for such illicit wildlife commod-
ities as tiger parts, caviar, elephant ivory, rhino horn, and 
exotic birds and reptiles. Wildlife contraband may include 
live pets, hunting trophies, fashion accessories, cultural ar-
tifacts, ingredients for traditional medicines, wild meat for 
human consumption (or bush meat), and other products. 
Illegal profi ts can be immense.
There are numerous problems presented by illegal wildlife 
exporting. Poachers imperil endangered species and threaten 
them with extinction. By evading government controls, they 
create the potential for introducing pests and diseases into 
formerly unaffected areas.114 They import nonnative species, 
which could harm the receiving habitats. Florida’s Everglades 
have been overrun with nonnative species such as pythons, 
imported as pets and abandoned in the wild. Illegal wildlife 
traders range from independent one-person operations that 
sell a single item to complex, multi-ton, commercial-sized 
consignments shipped all over the world. Adding all these 
sources together, the global trade in illegal wildlife is a grow-
ing phenomenon and is now estimated to be somewhere be-
tween $5 billion and $20 billion annually.
The United States is estimated to purchase nearly 20 per-
cent of all illegal wildlife and wildlife products on the market, 
perhaps as much as $3 billion annually. The trade is so lucra-
tive because exotic animals and animal parts are enormously 
expensive (Table 13.1), providing an economic incentive that 
proves irresistible to smugglers in third-world nations.
such as national parks, going over legally prescribed logging 
quotas, processing logs without acquiring licenses, and ex-
porting logs without paying export duties. By sidestepping 
the law, loggers can create greater profi ts than those gener-
ated through legal methods.
The situation is serious because illegal logging can have 
severe environmental and social impact:
Illegal logging exhausts forests, destroys wildlife, and 
 
■
damages its habitats. Illegal logging in central Africa is 
destroying the habitats and threatening the survival of 
populations of the great apes, including gorillas and 
chimpanzees.
It causes ruinous damage to the forests, including 
 
■
deforestation and forest degradation worldwide. The 
destruction of forest cover can cause fl ash fl oods and 
landslides that have killed thousands of people.
By reducing forest cover, illegal logging impairs the 
 
■
ability of land to absorb carbon emissions.
Illegal logging costs billions each year in government 
 
■
revenue, impairing the ability of third-world nations to 
provide needed social services.
It creates unsustainable economic devastation in the 
 
■
poorest countries. Vietnam, for example, has lost a third 
of its forest cover, while in nearby Cambodia illegal 
logging is at least ten times the size of the legal harvest. 
These rates of extraction are clearly unsustainable, de-
stroying valuable sources of employment and export 
revenues for the future.
The substantial revenues from illegal logging fund na-

tional and regional confl ict. In Cambodia, for several 
years Khmer Rouge insurgents were sustained primarily 
by the revenue from logging areas under their control.112
While the scale of illegal logging is diffi cult to estimate, 
it is believed that more than half of all logging activities in

464  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Illegal Fishing Unlicensed and illegal fi shing practices 
is another billion-dollar green crime. It can take on many 
forms and involve highly different parties, ranging from 
huge factory ships operating on the high seas that catch 
thousands of tons of fi sh on each voyage, to smaller, locally 
operating ships that confi ne themselves to national waters. 
Illegal fi shing occurs when these ships sign on to their home 
nation’s rules but then choose to ignore their scope and 
boundary, or operate in a country’s waters without permis-
sion or on the high seas without a fl ag. Because catches are 
not reported by the fi shing vessels, their illegal fi shing can 
have a detrimental effect on species because government 
regulators have no idea how many are being caught. Stocks 
become depleted and species endangered. In addition, ille-
gal fi shing techniques, including fi shermen using the wrong 
sized nets or fi shing in prohibited areas, can damage fragile 
marine ecosystems, threatening coral reefs, turtles, and sea-
birds. In underdeveloped nations, regulators may look the 
other way because the need for short-term economic, social, 
or political gains is given more weight than long-term sus-
tainability. As a result, species of whales, abalone, lobsters, 
and Patagonian toothfi sh (known in the U.S. as Chilean sea 
bass) have become endangered.116 The Profiles in Crime 
feature focuses on the illegal fi shing trade.
Illegal Dumping Some green-collar criminals want to 
skirt local, state, and federal restrictions on dumping dan-
gerous substances in the environment. Rather than pay 
expensive processing fees, they may secretly dispose of 
hazardous wastes in illegal dump sites. Illegally dumped 
The U.S. Congress has passed numerous laws that regu-
late and restrict wildlife imports and exports, including the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Lacey Act, which 
protects both plants and wildlife by creating civil and crimi-
nal penalties for a wide array of violations. The original act 
was directed at preserving game and wild birds and prohibit-
ing the introduction of nonnative birds and animals into na-
tive ecosystems. The act has been amended and in 1981 was 
changed to include illegal trade in plants, fi sh, and wildlife 
both domestically and abroad. The maximum penalty was 
increased to $10,000 with possible imprisonment for one 
year. Additionally, the mental state required for a criminal 
violation was increased to “knowingly and willfully;” civil 
penalties were expanded to apply to negligent violations.115
These laws and others establish authorities and guide-
lines for wildlife trade inspection at ports of entry and for 
wildlife crime law enforcement and prosecution. There are 
also international laws restricting the wildlife trade. The 
United Nations Convention on International Trade in En-
dangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) serves as 
the primary vehicle for regulating wildlife trade.
Despite such efforts, the trade still fl ourishes. It has been 
argued that one way to effectively control the movements of 
creatures across regions is to allow but closely monitor com-
mercial export of wildlife. However, where legalized trade is 
allowed, experience shows that this opens up opportunities 
for forging permits and other documentation, as well as for 
other types of enabling activity. For example, wild-caught 
animals can be mixed in with captive-bred animals, making 
illegal exports even harder to detect.
capacity for surveillance and enforcement 
of fishing regulations. The commander of 
Mozambique’s navy has ascertained that 
the “pirate fleets” concentrate their ac-
tivities around the Bazaruto archipelago, 
a marine reserve and national park about 
20 miles off the mainland. In July 2008, 
the control ships intercepted a Namibian-
flagged fishing boat, Antillas Reefer, after it 
was observed fishing without a license off 
the central province of Zambezia. On board, 
authorities found 43 tons of sharks, 4 tons 
of shark fin, 1.8 tons of shark tail, 11.3 tons 
of shark liver, and 20 tons of shark oil, with 
a total value of $5 million. They also seized 
65 tons of bait (frozen squid and fish) and 
illegal deepwater long lines. The Antillas 
Reefer logbook showed that the vessel had 
been fishing in Mozambique’s waters for 
months in an effort to capture a species 
of valuable deep-sea sharks banned as a 
target species in Mozambique. The penalty 
imposed was $4 million in addition to the 
confiscation of the vessel, fishing gear, and 
catch—an appropriate penalty for an IUU 
(illegal, unreported, and unregulated) fish-
ing vessel and a message for other would-
be IUU operators throughout the region.

and has increased potential jail sentences and fi nes for those 
convicted.118
Criminal environmental pollution is defined as the 
intentional or negligent discharge of a toxic or contaminat-
ing substance into the biosystem that is known to have an 
adverse effect on the natural environment or life. It may in-
volve the ground release of toxic chemicals such as kepone, 
vinyl chloride, mercury, PCBs, and asbestos. Illegal and/or 
controlled air pollutants include hydrochlorofl uorocarbons 
(HCFCs), aerosols, asbestos, carbon monoxide, chloro-
fl uorocarbons (CFCs), criteria air pollutants, lead, mercury, 
methane, nitrogen oxides (NOx), radon, refrigerants, and 
sulfur oxides (SO2). Water pollution is defi ned as the dump-
ing of a substance that degrades or alters the quality of the 
waters to an extent that is detrimental to their use by hu-
mans or by an animal or a plant that is useful to humans. 
This includes the disposal into rivers, lakes, and streams of:
Excess fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides from agri-
 
■
cultural lands and residential areas
Oil, grease, and toxic chemicals from urban runoff and 
 
■
energy production
Sediment from improperly managed construction sites, 
 
■
crop and forest lands, and eroding streambanks
Salt from irrigation practices and acid drainage from 
 
■
abandoned mines
Bacteria and nutrients from livestock, pet wastes, and 
 
■
faulty septic systems
Enforcing Environmental Laws
The United States and most sovereign nations have passed 
laws making it a crime to pollute or damage the environ-
ment. For example, among environmental laws in the U.S. 
are the following:
Clean Water Act (1972).
 
■
 Establishes and maintains goals 
and standards for U.S. water quality and purity. It was 
amended in 1987 to increase controls on toxic pollut-
ants, and in 1990 to more effectively address the hazard 
of oil spills.
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act 
 
■
(1986). Requires companies to disclose information 
about toxic chemicals they release into the air and water 
and dispose of on land.
Endangered Species Act (1973).
 
■
 Is designed to protect 
and recover endangered and threatened species of fi sh, 
wildlife, and plants in the United States and beyond. 
The law works in part by protecting species habitats.
Oil Pollution Act (1990).
 
■
 Enacted in the aftermath of the 
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska’s Prince William Sound, 
this law streamlines federal response to oil spills by 
requiring oil storage facilities and vessels to prepare 
spill-response plans and provide for their rapid imple-
mentation. The law also increases polluters’ liability for 
cleanup costs and damage to natural resources.
wastes can either be hazardous or nonhazardous materials 
that are discarded in an effort to avoid either disposal fees 
or the time and effort required for proper disposal. Materi-
als dumped ranged from used motor oil to waste from con-
struction sites.
One of the largest and fastest growing problems is the 
disposal of 7 million tons of obsolete high-tech electron-
ics, called e-waste, such as televisions, computers and 
computer monitors, laptops, VCRs, and so on.117 Accord-
ing to research by Carole Gibbs, Edmund McGarrell, and 
Mark Axelrod, while most e-waste in the United States is 
disposed of in landfi lls or is incinerated, the toxic mate-
rial contained in electronic gear (such as lead) encourages 
illegal dumping in order to avoid recycling costs. Conse-
quently, a considerable amount of e-waste is sent abroad to 
developing nations for recycling, often in violation of in-
ternational laws restricting such commerce. All too often, 
the material overwhelms recycling plants and is instead 
dumped in local villages near people and water sources. Il-
legal dump sites have been documented in Nigeria, Ghana, 
China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, and India, and 
they pose severe threats to both human health and the nat-
ural environment.
Illegal Polluting Long before the Gulf of Mexico disaster, 
environmental pollution crimes threatened the ecosystem. 
Prior to the BP spill, the most notorious environmental di-
saster occurred when the oil tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef in 
Prince William Sound and devastated Prudhoe Bay on the 
coast of Alaska. The spill released more than 11 million gal-
lons of crude oil, which covered more than 10,000 miles 
of ocean. At the time of the disaster, the Exxon Valdez was 
on autopilot; its captain, who may have been drinking, was 
asleep. Water pollution killed 250,000 sea birds, 2,800 sea 
otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 orcas, and 
billions of salmon and herring eggs. The spill continues to 
have an impact on many shore-dwelling animals. Sea otters 
have yet to reinhabit Herring Bay, and their overall numbers 
in the area have declined.
Exxon Mobil was fi ned $150 million and paid an addi-
tional $100 million as restitution for damage caused to fi sh, 
wildlife, and land, and also agreed to pay $900 million in 10 
annual installments to civil claimants. In 1994, a jury found 
that Exxon acted recklessly, and awarded victims $5 billion in 
punitive damages. The U.S. Supreme Court cut the amount 
to $507.5 million in June 2008, hardly a day’s pay for the 
largest company on earth.
Because of the Exxon Valdez disaster and other envi-
ronmental crimes, a great deal of attention is now paid to 
intentional or negligent environmental pollution caused by 
many large corporations. The numerous allegations in this 
area involve almost every aspect of U.S. business. Most en-
vironmental crime statutes contain overlapping civil, crimi-
nal, and administrative penalty provisions, which gives the 
government latitude in enforcement. Over time, Congress 
has elevated some violations from misdemeanors to felonies

466  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
section describes some of the most prominent views of why 
people commit crimes of criminal enterprise.
Rational Choice: Greed
When Kansas City pharmacist Robert Courtney was asked 
after his arrest why he substituted improper doses of drugs 
instead of what doctors had prescribed, he told investigators 
he cut the drugs’ strength “out of greed.”120
Courtney is not alone. One view of enterprise crime is 
that greedy people rationally choose to take shortcuts to 
acquire wealth, believing that the potential profi ts far out-
weigh future punishments. Most believe they will not get 
caught; they are far too clever to be detected by mere civil 
servants who work for government agencies.
Greed was rampant in the 1980s. Ivan Boesky was a fa-
mous Wall Street trader who had amassed a fortune of about 
$200 million by betting on corporate takeovers, a practice 
called arbitrage. In 1986, he was investigated by the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission for insider trading. To escape 
serious punishment, he informed on several associates. In ex-
change for cooperation, Boesky received a sentence of three 
and a half years in prison and a $100 million fi ne. Released 
after serving two years, Boesky was barred from working in 
the securities business for the remainder of his life.
Caught in the web was billionaire junk bond trader 
Michael Milken. Indicted by a federal grand jury, Milken 
pleaded guilty to fi ve securities and reporting violations and 
was sentenced to 10 years in prison; he served 22 months. 
He also paid a $200 million fi ne and another $400 million 
to $800 million in settlements relating primarily to civil 
lawsuits.
Lure Greed unfortunately did not end in the 1980s, and 
the greed that begat the Wall Street scandals of 2008 to 
2010 almost sank the world economy. Recently criminolo-
gists Neal Shover and Peter Grabosky introduced the con-
cept of “lure” to help explain why some people succumb to 
the illegal yet alluring benefi ts of enterprise crime:121
It may be discomforting to acknowledge, but experi-
ence teaches that at any given time there are persons 
in the larger world that are either bent on breaking 
the law or are easily tempted to do so. Likewise some 
organizations are predisposed to transgress. They are 
distinguished by structural, cultural, or procedural 
characteristics that increase the odds that their person-
nel will recognize and exploit lure. Tempted individuals 
possess qualities or experiences that make them more 
likely than peers who lack these distinctions to weigh 
illicit exploitation of lure. The size of the pool of the 
predisposed and tempted waxes and wanes depend-
ing upon a variety of other conditions in their worlds. 
These include the size of the supply of lure, prevailing 
estimates of the credibility of external oversight, and 
The major enforcement arm against environmental 
crimes is the Environmental Protection Agency, which was 
given full law enforcement authority in 1988. The EPA has 
successfully prosecuted signifi cant violations across all ma-

THE CAUSES OF 
ENTERPRISE CRIME
Why do people get involved in risky schemes to use their 
institutional positions to steal money? Why do people risk 
going to prison because they pollute the environment? Can 
the same factors that predict other types of criminal offenses 
also apply to crimes of criminal enterprise? After all, unlike 
other criminal offenses, white-collar and green-collar crimes 
are not committed by impoverished teenagers living in the 
inner city, but by otherwise respectable people, many of 
whom are educated and fi nancially well off. By their very 
nature, enterprise crimes require that offenders attain a po-
sition of power and trust before they can be committed. 
Therefore, can the theories that predict and explain com-
mon-law crime be applied to enterprise-type crime? This

CHAPTER 13 | Enterprise Crime: White-Collar and Green-Collar Crime  467
Rationalization/Neutralization View
Rationalizing guilt is a common trait of white-collar crimi-
nals.125 What they did was not so bad; what some call crime 
is merely a “technicality.” One offender convicted of price 
fi xing denied the illegality of his actions. “We did not fi x 
prices,” he said, “I am telling you that all we did was recover 
costs.”126 Some white-collar criminals believe that every-
one violates business laws, so it is not so bad if they do so 
themselves.
In his research on fraud, Donald Cressey found that 
the door to solving personal fi nancial problems through 
criminal means is opened by the rationalizations people 
develop for white-collar crime: “Some of our most re-
spectable citizens got their start in life by using other 
people’s money temporarily”; “in the real estate business, 
there is nothing wrong about using deposits before the 
deal is closed”; “all people steal when they get in a tight 
spot.”127 Offenders use these and other rationalizations 
to resolve the confl ict they experience over engaging in 
illegal behavior.
Some white-collar offenders feel free to engage in busi-
ness crime because they can easily rationalize its effects. 
Some convince themselves that their actions are not really 
crimes because the acts involved do not resemble street 
crimes. A banker who uses his position of trust to lend 
his institution’s assets to a company he secretly controls 
may see himself as a shrewd businessman, not as a crimi-
nal. A pharmacist who chisels customers on prescription 
drugs may rationalize her behavior by telling herself that it 
does not really hurt anyone. Further, some businesspeople 
feel justified in committing white-collar crimes because 
they believe government regulators do not really under-
stand the business world or the problems of competing 
in the free enterprise system. Research shows that speech, 
occupational, and physical therapists working in hospi-
tals, nursing homes, and with home health agencies en-
gage in Medicaid frauds, including cutting sessions short 
while charging for the entire session or charging individual 
session rates for group therapy sessions.128 When inter-
viewed, the workers used techniques of neutralization to 
defuse guilt: (a) everyone else does it, (b) it’s not my fault 
or responsibility, and (c) no one is hurt except insurance 
companies and they are wealthy.
Denying the Victim It is especially easy for corporate 
offenders to neutralize wrongdoing when the target is a 
fellow business person or business organization. Because 
the victim is knowledgeable and sophisticated, he or she 
should have known better; caveat emptor, as they say: let 
the buyer beware. Take for instance the 2010 indictment of 
Goldman Sachs, the respected securities company, charged 
with “fraudulent misconduct” due to the fi rm’s 2007 sale 
of $1 billion of repackaged subprime mortgage–backed se-
curities. While Goldman executives did not deny that they 
packaged and sold the securities, they questioned why their 
how extensively effective mechanisms of internal over-
sight and self-restraint are deployed.122
Lure is something that is alluring—something that is so 
attractive and covetable that it can turn the heads of those 
who are tempted or predisposed. The lure of enterprise 
crime has diverse sources. When a would-be green-collar 
criminal sees the wide expanses of uninhabited country-
side, they become tempted to dispose of trash quickly and 
cheaply. When states create loopholes in the law that pro-
vide opportunities that can be manipulated easily for crimi-
nal purposes—such as tax incentives, subsidies, low-interest 
loans, and other forms of access to public funds—these 
benefi ts may prove too much of a lure for businessmen to 
resist. As the supply of lure has expanded, so too has the 
number of privileged citizens and large corporations willing 
to risk legal censure to acquire its benefi ts. The lure of crime 
expands in the absence of capable control systems. When 
fi nancial oversight was absent in the United States economic 
markets, the crash of 2008 became inevitable.
Rational Choice: Need
Greed is not the only motivation for white-collar crime; need 
also plays an important role. Some people turn to crime to 
fulfi ll an overwhelming fi nancial or psychological need. Ex-
ecutives may tamper with company books because they feel 
the need to keep or improve their jobs, satisfy their egos, or 
support their children. Blue-collar workers may pilfer be-
cause they need to keep pace with infl ation or buy a new 
car. Kathleen Daly’s analysis of convictions in seven federal 
district courts indicates that many white-collar crimes in-
volve relatively trivial amounts. Women convicted of white-
collar crime typically work in lower-echelon positions, and 
their acts seem motivated more by economic survival than 
by greed and power.123
Even people in the upper echelons of the financial 
world, such as Boesky, may carry scars from an earlier needy 
period in their lives that can be healed only by accumulat-
ing ever-greater amounts of money. As one of Boesky’s as-
sociates put it:
I don’t know what his devils were. Maybe he’s greedy 
beyond the wildest imaginings of mere mortals like you 
and me. And maybe part of what drives the guy is an 
inherent insecurity that was operative here even after he 
had arrived. Maybe he never arrived.124
A well-known study of embezzlers by Donald Cressey il-
lustrates the important role need plays in white-collar crime. 
According to Cressey, embezzlement is caused by what he 
calls a “nonshareable financial problem.” This condition 
may be the result of offenders’ living beyond their means, 
perhaps piling up gambling debts; offenders feel they can-
not let anyone know about such fi nancial problems without 
ruining their reputations.

of executives have a more powerful control over decision 
making than the attitudes of outsiders—closest friends and 
business professors—whose more moderate views might have 
tempered the decision to commit crime.130
Business culture may have been responsible for the col-
lapse of Enron. A new CEO had been brought in to revi-
talize the company, and he wanted to become part of the 
“new economy” based on the Internet. Layers of manage-
ment were wiped out, and hundreds of outsiders were re-
cruited. Huge cash bonuses and stock options were granted 
to top performers. Young managers were given authority to 
make $5 million decisions without higher approval. It be-
came common for executives to change jobs two or three 
times in an effort to maximize bonuses and pay. Seminars 
were conducted showing executives how to hide profi ts and 
avoid taxes.131
The view that white-collar crime is a learning process 
is reminiscent of Edwin Sutherland’s description of 
how gang boys learn the techniques of drug dealing 
and burglary from older youths through differential 
association. See Chapter 7 for a description of this 
process.
CONNECTIONS
Those holding the business culture view would point 
to the Enron scandal as a prime example of what happens 
when people work in organizations in which the cultural 
values stress profit over fair play, government scrutiny is 
limited and regulators are viewed as the enemy, and senior 
members encourage newcomers to believe that “greed is 
good.”
Self-Control View
In their General Theory of Crime, Travis Hirschi and 
 Michael Gottfredson suggest that the motives that produce 
white-collar crimes—quick benefi ts with minimal effort—
are the same as those that produce any other criminal be-
haviors.132 White-collar criminals have low self-control 
and are inclined to follow momentary impulses with-
out considering the long-term costs of such behavior.133
White-collar crime is relatively rare because, as a matter of 
course, business executives tend to hire people with self-
control, thereby limiting the number of potential white-
collar criminals. Hirschi and Gottfredson have collected 
data showing that the demographic distribution of white-
collar crime is similar to other crimes. For example, gen-
der, race, and age ratios are the same for crimes such as 
embezzlement and fraud as they are for street crimes such 
as burglary and robbery.
behavior could possibly be considered a criminal act. The 
deal had been pitched to Goldman by hedge fund operator 
John Paulson, who offered the fi rm $15 million to help put 
together a package of home loans—known in the trade as 
a collateralized debt obligation (CDO)—and then market 
the loans to Goldman’s clients, including foreign banks. 
Paulson believed that the American real estate market was 
about to collapse and he wanted to create a fi nancial bet 
against what he considered to be distressed properties. In 
order to make his “bet,” he, along with Goldman execu-
tives, created a fund called Abacus that was comprised of 
home mortgages picked personally by Paulson on proper-
ties in Arizona, Florida, Nevada, and California, states that 
were undergoing a collapse in the real estate market. Gold-
man Sachs then marketed the Abacus fund without dis-
closing that Abacus fund buyers, including the Royal Bank 
of Scotland (which lost over $800 million in the deal), lost 
billions and Paulson made billions.
After the indictment was fi led, Goldman Sach’s execu-
tives claimed they did nothing wrong in marketing the se-
curities because purchasers were sophisticated banks and 
investment companies who knew what they were doing and 
should have realized that buying mortgage-backed secu-
rities was very risky, especially in a down real estate mar-
ket. Nor was their behavior unique: marketing derivative 
securities such as CDOs and the short-selling of assets is a 
common practice carried out by virtually every major Wall 
Street fi rm. In the end, the fi rm was fi ned $550 million to 
settle the claims, prompting the SEC’s enforcement direc-
tor, Robert S. Khuzami, to say, “This settlement is a stark 
lesson to Wall Street fi rms that no product is too complex, 
and no investor too sophisticated, to avoid a heavy price if a 
fi rm violates the fundamental principles of honest treatment 
and fair dealing,” While a fi ne of $550 million seems like 
a lot, it was considered a victory for Goldman, a fi rm that 
earns about $14 billion in profi t yearly, because it settled the 
case without admitting any wrongdoing.129 Here we can see 
how the line between smart business practice and corporate 
crime is typically blurry. When the victim can be denied, it 
is often diffi cult to accept blame.
Cultural View
Business culture may also infl uence white-collar crime. Ac-
cording to this view, some business organizations promote 
white-collar criminality in the same way that lower-class cul-
ture encourages the development of juvenile gangs and street 
crime. According to the corporate culture view, some busi-
ness enterprises cause crime by placing excessive demands 
on employees while at the same time maintaining a business 
climate tolerant of employee deviance. New employees learn 
the attitudes and techniques needed to commit white-collar 
crime from their business peers. Under these circumstances, 
the attitudes of closest coworkers and the perceived attitudes

CHAPTER 13 | Enterprise Crime: White-Collar and Green-Collar Crime  469
 1. Know what is meant by the 
term enterprise crime
Losses from enterprise crime 
 
■
may far outstrip any other 
type of crime. Enterprise crime 
involves criminal acts that 
twist the legal rules of com-
mercial enterprise for criminal 
purposes.
 2. Link white-collar crime and 
green-collar crime
White-collar and green-collar 
 
■
crime are linked together 
because they involve entre-
preneurship, and because in 
both types of crime offenders 
twist legal rules to enhance 
their personal economic posi-
tion through illicit commercial 
enterprise. Because they are so 
connected, these two types of 
crimes may sometimes overlap. 
Both forms of enterprise crime 
can involve violence.
 3. Defi ne white-collar crime
Edwin Sutherland fi rst used the 
 
■
phrase “white-collar crime” to 
describe the criminal activities 
of the rich and powerful. He 
defi ned white-collar crime as 
“a crime committed by a person 
of respectability and high social 
status in the course of his occu-
pation.” Included within recent 
views of white-collar crime are 
such acts as income tax evasion, 
credit card fraud, and bank-
ruptcy fraud. Other white-collar 
criminals use their positions of 
trust in business or government 
to commit crimes. Their activi-
ties might include pilfering, so-
liciting bribes or kickbacks, and 
embezzlement.
 4. Know what is meant by the 
term Ponzi scheme
■ A Ponzi scheme is an invest-
ment fraud that involves the 
payment of purported returns 
to existing investors from funds 
contributed by new investors. 
In many Ponzi schemes, the 
fraudsters focus on attracting 
new money to make promised 
payments to earlier-stage inves-
tors and to use for personal ex-
penses, instead of engaging in 
any legitimate investment activ-
ity. The term comes from 
Charles Ponzi, who duped 
thousands of New England resi-
dents into investing in a postage 
stamp speculation scheme back 
in the 1920s.
 5. Be familiar with the various 
forms of white-collar crime
■ White-collar fraud involves us-
ing a business enterprise as a 
front to swindle people. Chisel-
ing involves professionals who 
cheat clients. Embezzlement 
and employee fraud occur 
when a person uses a position 
of trust to steal from an organi-
zation. Client fraud involves 
theft from an organization that 
advances credit, covers losses, 
or reimburses for services. Cor-
porate, or organizational, crime 
involves various illegal business 
practices such as price fi xing, 
restraint of trade, and false 
advertising.
 6. Distinguish between exploita-
tion and infl uence peddling
■ White-collar exploitation oc-
curs when an individual abuses 
his or her power or position in 
an organization to coerce peo-
ple into making payments to 
him or her for services to which 
they are already entitled. If the 
payments are not made, the ser-
vices are withheld. In most 
cases, exploitation occurs when 
the victim has a clear right to 
expect a service, and the of-
fender threatens to withhold 
the service unless an additional 
payment or bribe is forthcom-
ing. In contrast, infl uence ped-
dling occurs when individuals 
holding important institutional 
positions sell power, infl uence, 
and information to outsiders 
SUMMARY
who have an interest in infl u-
encing the activities of the insti-
tution or buying information on 
what the institution may do in 
the future.
 7. Know what is meant by the 
term payola
■ In the record industry, payola is 
the illegal practice of recording 
companies paying radio stations 
or DJs to play songs. While the 
recording companies are forced 
to pay, they also benefi t from 
having their recording artists re-
ceive air time they might not 
otherwise have gotten.
 8. Discuss efforts to control white-
collar crime
■ The government has used vari-
ous law enforcement strategies 
to combat white-collar crime. 
Some involve deterrence, which 
uses punishment to frighten po-
tential abusers. Others involve 
economic or compliance strate-
gies, which create economic in-
centives to obey the law. Most 
offenders do not view them-
selves as criminals and therefore 
do not seem to be deterred by 
criminal statutes. Although 
thousands of white-collar crimi-
nals are prosecuted each year, 
their numbers are insignifi cant 
compared with the magnitude 
of the problem. The Commerce 
Clause of the U.S. Constitution 
gives the federal government 
the authority to regulate white-
collar crime. Detection and en-
forcement are primarily in the 
hands of administrative depart-
ments and agencies, including 
the FBI, the Internal Revenue 
Service, the Secret Service, U.S. 
Customs, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, and the Se-
curities and Exchange Commis-
sion. On the state and local 
levels, law enforcement offi cials 
have made progress in a num-
ber of areas, such as controlling 
consumer fraud.

 9. Know the basics of green-collar 
crime
■ There is no single vision to de-
fi ne the concept of green-collar 
crimes. Green-collar crime can 
take many different forms, rang-
ing from deforestation and illegal 
logging to violations of worker 
safety. The United States and 
most sovereign nations have 
passed laws making it a crime 
to pollute or damage the 
environment. The major en-
forcement arm against environ-
mental crimes is the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency, which was given full law 
enforcement authority in 1988.
 10. Be aware of the assumed cause 
of enterprise crime
■ There are numerous explana-
tions for enterprise crime. Some 
offenders are motivated by 
greed; others offend due 
to personal problems. They use 
rationalizations to allow their 
fi nancial needs to be met with-
out compromising their values. 
Corporate culture theory sug-
gests that some businesses actu-
ally encourage employees to 
cheat or cut corners. The self-
control view is that white-collar 
criminals are like any other law 
violators: impulsive people who 
lack self-control.

The tastefully crafted Emperor’s Club VIP website stated, “Our goal is to make life more peaceful, balanced, 
beautiful, and meaningful. We honor commitment to our clients as we covet long-term relationships of trust 
and mutual benefi t. Experience for yourself a service of obvious distinction.” It provided its “members” 
with the companionship of young, beautiful women for “total relaxation massage, entertainment purposes, 
modeling, or private dancing.” Site viewers also learned “We specialize in introductions of fashion models, 
pageant winners, and exquisite students, graduates, and women of successful careers (fi nance, art, media, 
etc.) to gentlemen of exceptional standards,” women who were primed to “make your dreams come true.” 
The site also showed hourly rates based on how many diamonds the young woman deserved: a seven-
diamond companion cost more than $3,000 an hour or $31,000 per day.

sex, and mood-altering drugs. They may also ban acts that 
a few people holding political power consider morally 
tinged, such as homosexual contact. Statutes like these are 
controversial in part because millions of otherwise law-
abiding citizens often engage in these outlawed activities 
and consequently become criminals. These statutes are 
also controversial because they selectively prohibit desired 
goods, services, and behaviors; in other words, they outlaw 
sin and vice.
This chapter fi rst briefl y discusses the relationship be-
tween law and morality. Next, the chapter addresses public 
order crimes of a sexual nature: paraphilias, prostitution, 
and pornography. The chapter concludes by focusing on the 
abuse of drugs and alcohol.
The Emperor’s Club, as we all know now, was a high-priced call girl ring. One of the young women, 
known professionally as Kristin, was actually 22-year-old Ashley Dupré. Rather than being a highly educated 
fashion model or career woman, Ashley was a high school dropout who had run away from an abusive home 
after completing her sophomore year in high school. Dupré knew what it was like to be broke, homeless, 
and in need of money. She claimed that she became a prostitute because her dream of a singing career hadn’t 
gotten off the ground. Ashley Dupré may have remained an unknown and anonymous “working girl” had it 
not been for a federal investigation of one of her clients, New York’s hard-charging governor, Eliot Spitzer, 
who at one time was considered a future presidential candidate. Known in the club as Client #9, Spitzer 
had paid $80,000 for services rendered. When a federal investigation uncovered his involvement with the 
Emperor’s Club, the scandal rocked the nation and Spitzer was forced to resign in disgrace. His career has 
since taken a positive turn: On June 24, 2010, CNN announced that Spitzer had been signed to headline a 
talk show with political columnist Kathleen Parker and he now appears on national TV.1
Kristin Davis—aka the Manhattan Madam, who ran the club—did not fare so well: she received a 
three-month jail sentence.2 Another employee, Temeka Rachelle Lewis, 32, of Brooklyn, a graduate of the 
prestigious University of Virginia with a bachelor’s degree in English language and literature, received one 
year’s probation. Lewis had been an honor student all her life and grew up in what has been described as “a 
good church-going family.”3 As for Ashley Dupré, she made thousands of dollars when her recording, “What 
We Want,” was played more than 3 million times on the Internet after the scandal erupted. The New York Post 
hired her to write a weekly advice column dealing with sex and relationships, she appeared in the May 2010 
issue of Playboy, and has been in talks to develop a reality TV show.
The Spitzer case is certainly not unique, and stories have circulated about students and suburban moms 
adding to their income by advertising sexual services on Internet sources such as Craigslist, a practice 
not without its risks. On April 14, 2009, aspiring model, Julissa Brisman, who advertised her services on 
Craigslist as a masseuse, was killed in Boston by Philip Markoff, a 23-year-old Boston University medical 
student. Investigators later found it was not the fi rst time Markoff had attacked a woman he had met via 
Craigslist and that he may have attacked at least two others.4 On August 15, 2010, Markoff committed suicide 
while in custody awaiting trial, so we will never know his motives for these horrendous crimes. And on 
September 4, 2010, Craigslist announced it would no longer advertise “adult services.”
S
Societies have long banned or limited behaviors believed to 
run contrary to social norms, customs, and values. These 
behaviors are often referred to as public order crimes or 
victimless crimes, although the latter term can be mislead-
ing.5 Public order crimes involve acts that interfere with the 
operations of society and the ability of people to function 
effi ciently. Put another way, whereas common-law crimes 
such as rape or robbery are banned because they cause so-
cial harm, other behaviors are outlawed simply because they 
confl ict with social policy, prevailing moral rules, and cur-
rent public opinion.
Statutes designed to uphold public order usually pro-
hibit the manufacture and distribution of morally question-
able goods and services such as erotic material, commercial

to 45 percent. In the aftermath, The Advocate, a national gay 
and lesbian newsmagazine, issued the following statement:
Even among many gays and lesbians—and certainly in 
mainstream culture—sex for pay remains the irredeem-
able sin. The president can be a recovering alcoholic 
with a DUI arrest; the vice president can accidentally 
shoot a man—all is forgiven. But if a person takes 
money for sex, the taint may be inescapable. Forget 
about running for offi ce. Forget about a high-profi le 
business career. Forget about acting, modeling, or MTV. 
It’s over. Even many gays will prefer that you take a hike.
Tom Malin’s experience illustrates the concern the pub-
lic and the media have with issues of morality and values. It 
is ironic that Malin could be a successful candidate for pub-
lic offi ce as an openly gay man, something that would have 
been unthinkable 50 years ago, yet his career was destroyed 
by his involvement in sex for hire. Although one act consid-
ered a violation of social norms only a few years ago is now 
accepted, another is still prohibited and shunned by “polite 
society.” Who decides what is acceptable behavior, what is 
not, and how we distinguish between them are still matters 
of great concern to criminologists.
Some scholars argue that acts like pornography, prosti-
tution, and drug use erode the moral fabric of society and 
therefore should be prohibited and punished. They are 
crimes, according to the great legal scholar Morris Cohen, 
because “it is one of the functions of the criminal law to give 
expression to the collective feeling of revulsion toward cer-
tain acts, even when they are not very dangerous.”11 In his 
classic statement on the function of morality in the law, legal 
scholar Sir Patrick Devlin states:
Without shared ideas on politics, morals, and ethics no 
society can exist. . . . If men and women try to create a 
society in which there is no fundamental agreement about 
good and evil, they will fail; if having based it on common 
agreement, the agreement goes, the society will disinte-
grate. For society is not something that is kept together 
physically; it is held by the invisible bonds of common 
thought. If the bonds were too far relaxed, the members 
would drift apart. A common morality is part of the 
bondage. The bondage is part of the price of society; and 
mankind, which needs society, must pay its price.12
According to this view, so-called victimless crimes are 
prohibited because one of the functions of criminal law is to 
express a shared sense of public morality.13
Some infl uential legal scholars have questioned the pro-
priety of legislating morals. H. L. A. Hart states:
It is fatally easy to confuse the democratic principle that 
power should be in the hands of the majority with the 
utterly different claim that the majority, with power in 
their hands, need respect no limits. Certainly there is a 
special risk in a democracy that the majority may dic-
tate how all should live.14
LAW AND MORALITY
Legislation of moral issues has continually frustrated lawmak-
ers because many of their constituents see little harm in visit-
ing a prostitute or smoking some pot. When a store is robbed 
or a child assaulted, it is easy to identify the victim and con-
demn the harm done. It is, however, more diffi cult to sympa-
thize with or even identify the victims of immoral acts, such 
as pornography or prostitution, where the parties involved 
may be willing participants. Some of the “providers” in the 
Emperor’s Club were paid more for a few days’ work than a 
waitress or a teacher makes in a year. The “models” seemed 
willing and well paid. Can we consider them victims? People 
who employed these women, such as Governor Spitzer, were 
wealthy and powerful men who freely and voluntarily spent 
their money for sexual services. Certainly they were not the 
victim here. If there is no victim, can there be a crime?
To answer this question, we might fi rst consider whether 
there is actually a victim in so-called “victimless crimes.” 
While some young women such as “Kristin” may have vol-
untarily engaged in highly paid sex work, many others have 
been coerced into the sex trade; they are therefore true vic-
tims. Research on prostitution shows that it is all too com-
mon for young runaways and abandoned children to be 
coerced into a life on the streets, where they are cruelly 
treated and held as virtual captives.6 It has been estimated 
that women involved in street prostitution are 60 to 100 
times more likely to be murdered than the average woman; 
more prostitutes are killed in disputes over money than over 
sexually motivated disputes.7 Clearly prostitution carries 
with it signifi cant professional risk. Other sexually related 
offenses, such as pornography, may involve people who vol-
untarily perform in “adult fi lms.” But feminist critics, such 
as Andrea Dworkin, point out that women involved in por-
nography, far from being highly paid stars, are “dehuman-
ized—turned into objects and commodities.”8
Even if public order crimes do not actually harm their 
participants, perhaps society as a whole should be consid-
ered the victim of these crimes. Is the community harmed 
when an adult bookstore opens or a brothel is established? 
Does this signal that a neighborhood is in decline? Does 
it teach children that deviance is both tolerated and prof-
itable? If women are degraded and sexualized in adult sex 
fi lms, does that send a message that it is acceptable to de-
mean and/or harm women?
Debating Morality
On February 17, 2006, the front page of the Dallas Morn-
ing News announced, “Candidate Worked as Prostitute.”9 It 
seems that Tom Malin, who was campaigning for a seat in 
the Texas House of Representatives as an openly gay candi-
date, had worked as a male escort.10 Though ahead in the 
race before the story broke, he lost the primary 55 percent

Adult websites now account for about 
20 percent of all Internet visits by U.S. 
users. Should all obscenity and pornog-
raphy be legalized if so many people are 
active users and wish to enjoy its con-
tent?18 And if the law tried to defi ne or 
limit objectionable material, might it not 
eventually inhibit free speech and politi-
cal dissent? Not so, according to social 
commentator Irving Kristol:
 
 If we start censoring pornography 
and obscenity, shall we not inevita-
bly end up censoring political opin-
ion? A lot of people seem to think 
this would be the case—which 
only shows the power of doctri-
naire thinking over reality. We had 
censorship of pornography and ob-
scenity for 150 years, until almost 
yesterday, and I am not aware that 
freedom of opinion in this country 
was in any way diminished as a 
consequence of this fact.19
Cultural clashes may ensue when 
behavior that is considered normative 
in one society is deplored by those liv-
ing in another. For example, Amnesty 
International estimates that more than 135 million of the 
world’s females have undergone genital mutilation.20 Cus-
tom and tradition are by far the most frequently cited rea-
sons for mutilation, and it is often carried out in a ritual 
during which the young woman is initiated into adult-
hood.21 The surgery is done to ensure virginity, remove 
sexual sensation, and render the females suitable for mar-
riage; a girl in these societies cannot be considered an 
adult unless she has undergone genital mutilation. Crit-
ics of this practice, led by American author Alice Walker 
(The Color Purple), consider the procedure mutilation and 
torture; others argue that this ancient custom should be 
left to the discretion of the indigenous people who con-
sider it part of their culture. “Torture,” counters Walker, 
“is not culture.” Can an outsider defi ne the morality of an-
other culture?22 Amnesty International and the United Na-
tions have worked to end the practice. Because of outside 
pressure, several African nations south of the Sahara have 
now instituted bans that are enforced with fi nes and jail 
terms. The procedure is now forbidden in Senegal, Egypt, 
Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Djibouti, 
Ghana, Guinea, and Togo. Other countries, among them 
Uganda, discourage it. In North Africa, the Egyptian Su-
preme Court upheld a ban on the practice and also ruled 
it had no place in Islam.23 Despite these efforts, thousands 
of girls are still subject to female circumcision every day 
in Africa and the Middle East and in Muslim areas all over 
the world.
Hart may be motivated by the fact that defi ning mo-
rality may be an impossible task: Who defi nes morality? 
Are we not punishing differences rather than social harm? 
As U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas once 
so succinctly put it, “What may be trash to me may be 
prized by others.”15 After all, many of the great works of 
Western art depict nude males and females, some quite 
young. Are the paintings of Rubens or the sculpture of 
Michelangelo obscene?
Joseph Gusfi eld argues that the purpose of outlawing 
immoral acts is to show the moral superiority of those who 
condemn the acts over those who partake of them. The leg-
islation of morality “enhances the social status of groups 
carrying the affi rmed culture and degrades groups carrying 
that which is condemned as deviant.”16 Research indicates 
that people who defi ne themselves as liberals are also the 
most tolerant of sexually explicit material. Demographic at-
tributes such as age, educational attainment, and occupa-
tional status may also infl uence views of pornography: the 
young and better educated tend to be more tolerant than 
older, less-educated people.17 Whose views should prevail?
And, if a majority of the population chooses to engage 
in what might objectively be considered immoral or devi-
ant behavior, would it be fair or just to prohibit or control 
such behavior or render it criminal? According to Hitwise, 
an Internet monitoring corporation, online porn sites get 
about three times more visits than the top three web search 
engines, including Google, Yahoo, and Bing (MSN Search). 
A woman who performs genital cutting in her village in Ivory Coast passes by a poster 
supporting the abolition of female genital mutilation. An estimated 40 percent of women in Ivory 
Coast undergo this mutilation. Despite efforts to abolish the practice, more than 135 million 
women worldwide have experienced some form of genital mutilation and more than 2 million 
girls are estimated to undergo the procedure every year in African and Middle Eastern nations 
such as Iraq.

CHAPTER 14 | Public Order Crime: Sex and Substance Abuse  479
colleagues the right to fi ght crime in America? The assump-
tion that it is okay to take matters into your own hands if 
the cause is right and the target is immoral is not lost on the 
younger generation. Gang boys sometimes take on the street 
identity of “Batman” or “Superman” so they can battle their 
rivals with impunity.
Fictional characters are not the only ones who take it 
upon themselves to fight for moral decency; members of 
special-interest groups are also ready to do battle.27 Public 
order crimes often trace their origin to moral crusaders who 
seek to shape the law toward their own way of thinking; 
Howard Becker calls them moral entrepreneurs. These rule 
creators, argues Becker, operate with an absolute certainty 
that their way is right and that any means are justified to 
get their way: “The crusader is fervent and righteous, often 
self-righteous.”28 Today’s moral crusaders take on such issues 
as prayer in school, gun ownership, gay marriage, abortion, 
and the distribution of sexually explicit material to minors.
During the 1930s, Harry Anslinger, then head of the 
Federal Bureau of Narcotics, used magazine articles, public 
appearances, and public testimony to sway public opinion 
about the dangers of marijuana, which until that time was 
legal to use and possess.29 In testimony before the House 
Ways and Means Committee, considering passage of the 
Marijuana Tax Act of 1938, Anslinger stated:
In Florida a 21-year-old boy under the infl uence of this 
drug killed his parents and his brothers and sisters. The 
evidence showed that he had smoked marihuana. In 
Chicago recently two boys murdered a policeman while 
under the infl uence of marihuana. Not long ago we 
found a 15-year-old boy going insane because, the doc-
tor told the enforcement offi cers, he thought the boy 
was smoking marihuana cigarettes. They traced the sale 
to some man who had been growing marihuana and 
selling it to these boys, all under 15 years of age, on a 
playground there.30
As a result of Anslinger’s efforts, a deviant behavior—
marijuana use—became a criminal behavior, and previously 
law-abiding citizens were defi ned as criminal offenders.
Moral Crusades Today
Moral crusades are sometimes designed to draw a bright line 
between behavior that is considered morally acceptable and 
behavior that right-thinking people would consider deviant 
and unacceptable. Today, popular targets of moral crusad-
ers are abortion clinics, pornographers, gun dealers, and de-
spoilers of the environment.
Of course, what is right and moral is often in the eye of 
the beholder. Take for instance the 2004 incident in which 
shock jock Howard Stern was fi ned by the Federal Com-
munication Commission (FCC) for “repeated, graphic, and 
explicit sexual descriptions that were pandering, titillating, 
or used to shock the audience.”31 The government action 
Social Harm
Most societies have long banned or limited behaviors that 
are believed to run contrary to social norms, customs, and 
values. However, many acts that most of us deem highly im-
moral and objectionable are not in fact criminal. There are 
no laws banning superbia (hubris/pride), avaritia (avarice/
greed), luxuria (extravagance or lust), invidia (envy), gula 
(gluttony), ira (wrath), or acedia (sloth) even though they 
are considered the “seven deadly sins.” Nor is it a crime to 
ignore the pleas of a drowning child, even though to do so 
might be considered callous, coldhearted, and unfeeling. 
(Of course, some people—lifeguards, paramedics, fi remen, 
police, and the child’s parents—do have a legal duty to help 
save the child.)
While the theory of social harm can explain most crim-
inal acts, it cannot explain them all. Some acts that cause 
enormous amounts of social harm are perfectly legal, while 
others that many people consider virtually harmless are 
outlawed and severely punished. It is now estimated more 
than 500,000 deaths in the United States each year can 
be linked to the consumption of tobacco and alcohol, yet 
these “deadly substances” remain legal to produce and sell. 
Similarly, sports cars and motorcycles that can accelerate to 
more than 150 miles per hour are perfectly legal to sell and 
possess even though between 30,000 and 40,000 people 
die each year in car accidents.24 On the other hand, illegal 
drugs kill “only” about 27,000 people annually, and none 
of these fatalities are linked to marijuana.25 Yet, the sale of 
marijuana and other recreational drugs is still banned and 
heavily punished.26 According to the theory of social harm, 
if more people die each year from alcohol-, tobacco-, and 
automobile-related causes, while smoking pot is relatively 
safe, then should marijuana be legalized and Corvettes, 
Johnny Walker, and Marlboros outlawed? But they are not.
Moral Crusades and Crusaders
In the early West, vigilance committees were set up in San 
Francisco and other boom towns to pursue cattle rustlers 
and stagecoach robbers and to dissuade undesirables from 
moving in. These vigilantes held a strict standard of moral-
ity that, when they caught their prey, resulted in sure and 
swift justice.
The avenging vigilante has remained part of popular 
culture. Fictional do-gooders who take it on themselves to 
enforce the law, battle evil, and personally deal with those 
whom they consider immoral have become enmeshed in 
the public consciousness. From the Lone Ranger to Spider-
man, the righteous vigilante is expected to go on moral cru-
sades without any authorization from legal authorities. Who 
actually told Spiderman he can destroy half of New York 
while fi ghting Dr. Octopus or the Green Goblin? And what 
about the Justice League? What gives the Martian Man-
hunter, Wonder Woman, Plastic Man, and their superhero

2003 when the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a historic de-
cision in Lawrence v. Texas, which made it impermissible for 
states to criminalize oral and anal sex and all other forms 
of intercourse that are not heterosexual under statutes pro-
hibiting sodomy, deviant sexuality, or buggery.36 The Law-
rence case involved two gay men who had been arrested in 
1998 for having sex in the privacy of their Houston home. 
In overturning their convictions, the Court said this:
Although the laws involved . . . here . . . do not more 
than prohibit a particular sexual act, their penalties 
and purposes have more far-reaching consequences, 
touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual 
behavior, and in the most private of places, the home. 
They seek to control a personal relationship that, 
whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the 
law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without 
being punished as criminals. The liberty protected by 
the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right 
to choose to enter upon relationships in the confi nes of 
their homes and their own private lives and still retain 
their dignity as free persons.
As a result of the decision, all sodomy laws in the United 
States were suddenly unconstitutional and unenforceable; 
acts that were once a crime were legalized. The Lawrence 
decision paved the way for states to rethink their marriage 
laws. In 2003, Massachusetts’s highest court ruled that same-
sex couples are legally entitled to wed under the state con-
stitution, and that the state may not “deny the protections, 
benefi ts, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two 
individuals of the same sex who wish to marry.”37 A number 
of other states, including Vermont, New Hampshire, Iowa, 
and Connecticut, have followed suit while others have cre-
ated legal unions that—while not being called marriage—
offer all the rights and responsibilities of marriage under 
state law to same-sex couples. Other states have either 
granted limited rights or recognize the legality of same-sex 
marriages performed elsewhere. In California, the State Su-
preme Court ruled, in May 2008, that the state constitution 
guaranteed gay and lesbian couples the “basic civil right” to 
marry. Moral crusaders opposed to gay marriage mounted 
a campaign that resulted in the passage of Proposition 8, 
which added a new section to the state constitution that 
reads: “Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid 
or recognized in California,” thus outlawing gay marriage 
once again.38 The battle was not over. On August 4, 2010, 
a federal judge declared the ban unconstitutional but tem-
porarily stayed the ruling; the issue remains in the courts. 
Supporters and opponents vow not to give up the fi ght, and 
future ballot initiatives are now being formulated.
The debate over gay marriage rages on: Is it fair to pre-
vent one group of loyal tax-paying citizens from engaging in 
a behavior that is allowed others? Are there objective stan-
dards of morality or should society respect people’s differ-
ences? After all, opponents charge, polygamy is banned and 
there are age standards for marriage in every state. If gay 
prompted the Clear Channel Communication Company to 
drop Stern’s show from their stations. In retaliation, Stern 
posted on his website transcripts from the Oprah Winfrey 
TV show that used very similar language but was deemed 
inoffensive by government regulators.32 Stern was so out-
raged by the crusade to censor his program that he left pub-
lic broadcasting for unregulated satellite radio.
One popular target for moral crusaders are anti-smut 
campaigns that target books considered too “racy” or contro-
versial to be suitable for a public school library. According 
to the American Library Association (ALA), between 2000 
and 2006 the Harry Potter series topped the yearly list of 
books challenged by critics, who demanded their removal 
from school library shelves. Most of the objections to J. K. 
Rowling’s popular series about a young wizard in England 
centered on the charge that the series promotes Satanism 
and magic. In the last few years, complaints against Harry 
and his friends have been outpaced by those lodged against 
Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson’s And Tango Makes Three, 
a children’s book that tells the story of two male zoo pen-
guins who are given an egg and raise a baby penguin chick 
together. Because it is geared to a preschool audience, oppo-
nents suggest that the underlying theme of the book, learn-
ing to accept same-sex relationships (even among penguins), 
is morally unacceptable. In 2009, the book series TTYL, 
TTFN, L8R, G8R, by Lauren Myracle, aimed at adolescent 
girls, topped the ALA list, followed by Tango; Harper Lee’s 
masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird was ranked fourth.33
In their efforts to protect society, moral crusaders may 
sometimes engage in illegal and immoral conduct them-
selves. Abortion foes have resorted to violence and murder 
to rid the nation of pro-choice health care providers whom 
they consider immoral while failing to realize the depravity 
of their own extreme acts.
Some moral crusaders justify their actions by claiming 
that the very structure of our institutions and beliefs are in 
danger because of immorality. Andrea Friedman’s analysis of 
anti-obscenity campaigns during the Cold War era (post–
World War II) found that the politics of the times led to im-
ages of aggressive or even violent males in comic books and 
pornography. Moral crusaders argued that this depiction 
was threatening to erode family values, which led them to 
advocate a ban on violent comics and porn magazines.34
The Gay Marriage Crusade One of the most heated of 
“moral crusades” has been directed at infl uencing public ac-
ceptance of the gay lifestyle. One group of crusaders is de-
termined to prevent the legalization of gay marriage; their 
objective is passage of a constitutional amendment declar-
ing that marriage is between one man and one woman. The 
Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, which defi ned marriage 
as a union of one man and one woman for the purposes of 
federal law, is one of their legal achievements.35
Opposing them are groups of activists who have tire-
lessly campaigned for the civil rights of gay men and 
women. One of their most important victories occurred in

CHAPTER 14 | Public Order Crime: Sex and Substance Abuse  481
PARAPHILIAS
On June 4, 2009, newspaper headlines around the world 
told the shocking story of actor David Carradine, who was 
found dead in a Thailand hotel. Authorities discovered the 
72-year-old actor hanging in his closet, the victim of an au-
toerotic death resulting from engaging in asphyxiophilia, self-
strangulation that restricts the supply of oxygen or blood to 
the brain in order to increase sexual intensity.43
Carradine’s death was attributed to his involvement with 
a common form of paraphilias (Greek para, “to the side of,” 
and philos, “loving”)—bizarre or abnormal sexual practices 
involving recurrent sexual urges focused on (a) nonhuman 
objects (such as underwear, shoes, or leather), (b) humilia-
tion or the experience of receiving or giving pain (such as in 
sadomasochism or bondage), or (c) children or others who 
cannot grant consent. Paraphilias is not a new phenomenon. 
Buddhist texts from more than 2,000 years ago contain ref-
erences to sexually deviant behaviors among monastic com-
munities, including sexual activity with animals and sexual 
interest in corpses. Richard von Krafft-Ebing’s Psychopathia 
Sexualis, published in 1887, was the first text to discuss 
such paraphilias as sadism, bestiality, and incest.
When paraphilias, such as wearing clothes normally 
worn by the opposite sex (transvestite fetishism), are en-
gaged in by adults in the privacy of their homes they remain 
outside the law’s reach. However, when paraphilias involve 
unwilling or underage victims they are considered socially 
harmful and subject to criminal penalties. Included in this 
group of outlawed sexual behaviors are these practices:
Asphyxiophilia (autoerotic asphyxia). 
 
■
By means of a 
noose, ligature, plastic bag, mask, volatile chemicals, 
or chest compression, attempting partial asphyxia and 
oxygen deprivation to the brain to enhance sexual grati-
fi cation. Almost all cases of asphyxiophilia involve males.
Frotteurism. 
 
■
Rubbing against or touching a nonconsent-
ing person in a crowd, elevator, or other public area.
Voyeurism. 
 
■
Obtaining sexual pleasure from spying on a 
stranger while he or she disrobes or engages in sexual 
behavior with another.
Exhibitionism. 
 
■
Deriving sexual pleasure from exposing 
the genitals to surprise or shock a stranger.
Sadomasochism. 
 
■
Deriving pleasure from receiving pain 
or infl icting pain on another.
Pedophilia
Between 2002 and 2004, the archdiocese of Boston was 
shaken by allegations that a signifi cant number of priests had 
engaged in sexual relations with minor children. The archdi-
ocese eventually turned over the names of nearly 100 priests 
to prosecutors. As the scandal spread, clergy elsewhere in 
the United States and abroad resigned amid allegations that 
marriage is legalized, what about marriage to multiple part-
ners, or with underage minors? How far should the law go 
in curbing human behaviors that do not cause social harm? 
Who controls the law and should the law be applied to 
shape morality?
The public order crimes discussed in this chapter are 
divided into two broad areas. The first relates to what 
conventional society considers deviant sexual practices: 
paraphilias, prostitution, and pornography. The second area 
concerns the use of substances that have been outlawed or 
controlled because of the alleged harm they cause: drugs 
and alcohol.
SEXUALLY RELATED 
OFFENSES
In 2001, the state of Connecticut was rocked when Wa-
terbury Mayor Philip Giordano, a married father of three, 
was arrested for engaging in sexual relations with minors 
as young as 8 years old. Giordano was a highly respected 
officeholder who had been the Republican candidate for 
the U.S. Senate in the 2000 campaign (he lost to incumbent 
 Joseph Lieberman). During an FBI investigation into city 
corruption, a 17-year-old girl came forward and charged 
that Giordano had paid her to have sex with him in his pri-
vate law offi ce and to watch him have sex with her aunt, 
Guitana Jones. The teenager told state offi cials that from the 
time she was 10, Jones arranged for her to have paid sexual 
encounters with men (including the mayor); Jones’s own 
daughter, only 8 years old, was also involved.39 On March 
25, 2003, a federal jury convicted Giordano of violating 
the civil rights of the two young girls. He was also found 
guilty of conspiracy and of using an interstate device—a cell 
phone—to arrange the meetings with the girls. Giordano 
 received a sentence of 37 years in federal prison.40
The Giordano case is particularly shocking because it 
involves a high public offi cial. And although it is unusual 
for its sordidness, it is not unique or uncommon. The most 
recent national data indicates that more than 60,000 cases 
of sexual abuse are now being reported to government agen-
cies each year.41 Yet this may be only the tip of the iceberg 
since many cases go unreported. Experts have estimated 
that each year more than 325,000 children are subjected 
to some form of sexual exploitation, which includes sexual 
abuse, prostitution, use in pornography, and molestation 
by adults.42 Because of these alarming statistics and also 
because some sexual practices are believed to cause social 
harm, some elements of sexual conduct have been made il-
legal in the United States and abroad. Below, three of the 
most common offenses, paraphilias, prostitution, and por-
nography, are discussed in some detail.

482  PAR THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
Nowhere did the scandal take on greater proportion than 
in the Boston area, where Cardinal Bernard Law was forced 
to step down as leader of the diocese. Numerous churches 
were closed or sold to help raise money for legal fees and 
victim compensation. Among the most notorious offenders 
was Father James Porter, accused of molesting at least 125 
children of both sexes over a 30-year period reaching back 
to the early 1960s. Porter was eventually sentenced to an 18- 
to 20-year prison term. The church continues to be haunted 
by charges levied against priests. Recently, it was revealed 
that Fr. Lawrence Murphy, who taught at St. John’s School 
for the Deaf in a suburb of Milwaukee from 1950 through 
1974, sexually abused about 200 boys. The Murphy case 
made national headlines again recently after documents were 
they had abused children or failed to stop abuse of which 
they had knowledge. In Ireland, the Most Reverend Bren-
dan Comiskey, the Bishop of Ferns, offered his resignation 
to the pope, and an archbishop in Wales was forced to resign 
because he had ignored complaints about two priests later 
convicted of sexually abusing children. Responding to the 
crisis, Pope John Paul II called a special meeting of American 
Catholic leaders in April 2002 to create new policies on sex 
abuse. The pope issued a statement in which he said that 
there is “no place in the priesthood . . . for those who would 
harm the young.” He added that sexual abuse by the clergy 
was not only an “appalling sin” but a crime, and he noted 
that “many are offended at the way in which church leaders 
are perceived to have acted in this matter.”
arrested in Georgia. While in police custody, 
Couey admitted that he had entered the 
Lunsford home at around 3 a.m. on Febru-
ary 24, 2005, and found Jessica asleep in 
her bed. He woke her and ordered her to be 
quiet. “Don’t yell or nothing,” he said and 
told her to follow him back to his sister’s 
house, where he raped her repeatedly and 
kept her in a closet for three days. When 
he learned that detectives were searching 
for him, he panicked and buried her even 
though she was still alive. He showed inves-
tigators the shallow grave where they found 
Jessica’s body inside two tied plastic gar-
bage bags. Her wrists were bound, but she 
had managed to poke two fingers through 
the plastic in an attempt to free herself.
Couey was found guilty of murder on 
March 7, 2007, and a death penalty hearing 
was held soon after. In closing statements, 
prosecutor Ric Ridgway called the crime 
“evil” and asked jurors to remember how 
Jessica died by suffocating in the hole Couey 
dug, accompanied only by a stuffed toy she 
had grabbed as she was being abducted. 
“She was in pain. In the dark. She was cer-
tainly terrified,” Ridgway said in his closing 
statement. “If this is not the person who de-
serves the death penalty, who does?”
Defense lawyers pleaded for mercy, ar-
guing that Couey deserved no more than a 
life sentence in prison because of mental 
retardation and mental illness, neglect as a 
child, and the effects of alcohol and drug 
abuse. “No matter what you do, John Couey 
is going to die in prison,” said defense at-
torney Alan Fanter. “No child should have to 
die the way Jessica Lunsford did. But justice 
is not vengeance.” The jury did not buy that 
argument and sentenced Couey to death on 
March 14, 2007. He died of cancer in prison 
in September 2009, before the sentence 
was carried out.
In the aftermath of Jessica Lunsford’s 
abduction, Florida passed legislation that 
requires increased prison sentences, elec-
tronic tracking of all convicted sex offend-
ers on probation, and the mandatory use 
of state databases by all local probation 
officials so that known sex offenders could 
not avoid the scrutiny of law enforcement. 
Can such measures control the behavior 
of pedophiles such as Couey before they 
kill their innocent victims?

John Evander Couey and the Jessica Lunsford Murder Case
On February 24, 2005, 9-year-old Jessica 
Lunsford was reported missing from her 
home. When a child is reported missing, 
the police typically check on all the known 
sex offenders in the area, which in this 
case included John Evander Couey, 46, 
who was not living at the address where 
he was registered, a legal violation. Police 
located Couey and searched his room, not 
finding anything. Couey had a long list of 
convictions, including burglary, carrying 
a concealed weapon, disorderly intoxica-
tion, driving under the influence, indecent 
exposure, disorderly conduct, fraud, insuf-
ficient funds, and larceny. A habitual drug 
abuser, in 1991 he had been arrested and 
charged with “fondling a child under the 
age of 16.”
Nineteen days after Jessica Lunsford was 
first reported missing, detectives returned to 
Couey’s home and this time found blood 
on the mattress. Couey had fled but was

Of all the commonly practiced paraphilias, pedophilia 
is the one that most concerns the general public. While the 
cause of pedophilia has not been determined, suspected fac-
tors include abnormal brain structure, social maladaption, 
and neurological dysfunction.45 There is also some evidence 
that genetic factors are responsible for the development of 
pedophilia.46 Other suspected connections range from cog-
nitive distortions to exposure to pornography.47
Whatever the cause, pedophilia is not a limited prob-
lem; one notable research study found that more than 20 
percent of males report sexual attraction to at least one 
child.48 However, men are not the only sexual predators; 
women are also involved. One study of more than 100 adult 
female sex offenders found that 77 percent of the cases in-
volved child abuse and in about two-thirds of the cases, 
women had co-offended with a male co-offender. Tragically, 
they mostly abused their own children together with their 
male intimate partner.49
One of the most horrifi c cases of pedophilia involved the 
kidnapping and death of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford, which 
is the subject of the Profi les in Crime feature.
PROSTITUTION
Eliot Spitzer is not the only well-known politician to get 
caught up in a prostitution scandal. On July 16, 2007, Loui-
siana’s conservative Republican senator David Vitter apolo-
gized to the public after his telephone number showed up 
in the phone records of Pamela Martin and Associates, the 
alleged prostitution ring run in the nation’s capital by so-
called “D.C. Madam” Deborah Jeane Palfrey. “This was a 
very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, com-
pletely responsible,” Vitter said remorsefully. Soon after he 
issued his statement, Jeanette Maier, a former madam who 
ran a house of prostitution in New Orleans, claimed Vitter 
was also a client in her brothel. She told the press, “As far as 
the girls coming out after seeing David, all they had was nice 
things to say. It wasn’t all about sex. In fact, he just wanted to 
have somebody listen to him, you know. And I said his wife 
must not be listening,” Vitter won re-election to the Senate 
in 2010. Frequenting brothels and employing prostitutes is 
hardly the behavior expected from a married senator known 
for his strong advocacy of family values!50 Senator Vitter was 
not alone in enjoying the services of the D.C. Madam—also 
on her call list was Randall L. Tobias, who was forced to step 
down as deputy secretary of state, and Harlan K. Ullman, the 
military affairs scholar who created the Pentagon’s concept 
known as “shock and awe.”51
Prostitution has been known for thousands of years. 
The term derives from the Latin prostituere, which means 
“to cause to stand in front of.” The prostitute is viewed as 
publicly offering his or her body for sale. The earliest re-
cord of prostitution appears in ancient Mesopotamia, where 
priests engaged in sex to promote fertility in the community. 
All women were required to do temple duty, and passing 
strangers were expected to make donations to the temple 
after enjoying its services.52
Modern commercial sex appears to have its roots in an-
cient Greece, where Solon established licensed brothels in 
500 BCE. The earnings of Greek prostitutes helped pay for 
the temple of Aphrodite. Famous men openly went to pros-
titutes to enjoy intellectual, aesthetic, and sexual stimula-
tion; prostitutes, however, were prevented from marrying.53
During the Middle Ages, although prostitution was 
a sin under canon law, it was widely practiced and con-
sidered a method of protecting “respectable” women who 
might otherwise by attacked by young men. In 1358, the 
Grand Council of Venice declared that prostitution was “ab-
solutely indispensable to the world.”54 Some church lead-
ers, such as St. Thomas Aquinas, condoned prostitution; 
St. Augustine wrote: “If you expel prostitution from society, 
you will unsettle everything on account of lusts.”55 None-
theless, prostitution was offi cially condemned and working 
girls confi ned to ply their trade in certain areas of the city 
and required to wear distinctive outfi ts so they could be 
easily recognized. Any offi cial tolerance disappeared after 
the Reformation. Martin Luther advocated abolishing pros-
titution on moral grounds, and Lutheran doctrine depicted 
prostitutes as emissaries of the devil who were sent to de-
stroy the faith.56
During the early nineteenth century, prostitution was 
tied to the rise of English breweries: saloons controlled by 
the companies employed prostitutes to attract patrons and 
encourage them to drink. This relationship was repeated in 
major U.S. cities, such as Chicago, until breweries were for-
bidden to own the outlets that distributed their product.
Today there are many variations, but in general, prosti-
tution can be defi ned as granting nonmarital sexual access, 
established by mutual agreement of the prostitutes, their cli-
ents, and their employers, for remuneration. This defi nition 
is sexually neutral because prostitutes can be straight or gay, 
male or female.
Prostitutes are referred to by sociologists as “street-level 
sex workers” whose activities are similar to any other service 
industry. These conditions are usually present in a commer-
cial sexual transaction:
Activity that has sexual signifi cance for the customer.

This 
includes the entire range of sexual behavior, from sexual 
intercourse to exhibitionism, sadomasochism, oral sex, 
and so on.

death penalty. An example of the former is Germany, which 
has a fl ourishing legal sex trade. In 2002, Germany passed a 
new law removing the prohibition against prostitution and 
allowed prostitutes to obtain regular work contracts and 
receive health insurance. In turn, the prostitutes were re-
quired to register with the authorities and pay taxes. The 
city of Cologne made headlines in 2004 when it introduced 
a sex tax that brings in more than a million dollars per year. 
Each prostitute pays a tax of 150 euros per month, and sex 
club owners pay 3 euros per 90 square feet of space in their 
establishments. The city of Dortmund is considering a fee 
of 1 euro per day for prostitutes to use the streets, and 15 
euros per working day to work as a prostitute.64 Many sex 
establishments are quite lavish and an estimated 400,000 
people work in the German sex trade.65 In contrast, many 
Islamic countries punish prostitution with death. In one in-
cident that made international headlines, three women and 
three men were stoned to death in Iran after a court found 
them guilty of adultery and prostitution under Islamic laws. 
The stoning was carried out by local citizens in public in 
Khazar Abad, near the Caspian Sea.66
There is also a troubling overseas trade in prostitution 
in which men from wealthy countries frequent semi-regu-
lated sex areas in needy nations such as Thailand in order 
to procure young girls forced or sold into prostitution—a 
phenomenon known as sex tourism. In addition to sex tours, 
there has also been a soaring demand for pornography, strip 
clubs, lap dancing, escorts, and telephone sex in developing 
countries.67
Types of Prostitutes
Several different types of prostitutes operate in the United 
States. As you will see, each group operates in a particular 
venue.
Streetwalkers Prostitutes who work the streets in plain 
sight of police, citizens, and customers are referred to as 
hustlers, hookers, or streetwalkers. Although glamorized by 
the Julia Roberts character in the fi lm Pretty Woman (who 
winds up with a billionaire played by Richard Gere), street-
walkers are considered the least attractive, lowest paid, most 
vulnerable men and women in the profession. They are most 
likely to be impoverished members of ethnic or racial mi-
norities. Many are young runaways who gravitate to major 
cities to fi nd a new, exciting life and escape from sexual and 
physical abuse at home.68 In the United States and abroad, 
streetwalkers tend to be younger than other prostitutes, start 
working at a younger age, and have less education. More 
use money from sex work for drugs and use drugs at work; 
they are more likely than other prostitutes to be the targets 
of extreme forms of violence.69
Streetwalkers wear bright clothing, makeup, and jewelry 
to attract customers, and they take their customers to hotels. 
The term hooker, however, is not derived from the ability of 
Economic transaction. 
 
■
Something of economic value, not 
necessarily money, is exchanged for the activity.
Emotional indifference. 
 
■
The sexual exchange is simply 
for economic consideration. Although the participants 
may know each other, their interaction has nothing 
to do with affection.57 Men believe that the lack of 
involvement makes hiring a prostitute less of a hassle 
and less trouble than becoming involved in a romantic 
relationship.58
Sociologist Monica Prasad observed these conditions 
when she interviewed both men and women about their 
motivation to employ a prostitute. Although their choice 
was shaped by sexuality, she found that their decision was 
also infl uenced by pressure from friends to try something 
different and exciting, the wish for a sexual exchange free 
from obligations, and curiosity about the world of prosti-
tution. Prasad found that most customers who became 
“regulars” began to view prostitution merely as a “service 
occupation.”59
Incidence of Prostitution
It is diffi cult to assess the number of prostitutes operating 
in the United States. In the 1920s, about two-thirds of non–
college-educated men and one-quarter of college-educated 
men had visited a prostitute.60 It is likely that the number of 
men who hire prostitutes has declined sharply; the number 
of arrests for prostitution has declined more than 15 percent 
during the past decade while the population has increased.61 
How can these changes be accounted for? The sexual revo-
lution has liberalized sexuality so that men are less likely 
to use prostitutes because legitimate alternatives for sexual-
ity are now available. In addition, the prevalence of sexually 
transmitted diseases has caused many men to avoid visit-
ing prostitutes for fear of irreversible health hazards. While 
traditional forms of prostitution may be in decline, ehook-
ing, which uses the Internet to shield identities and contact 
clients, may be responsible for a resurgence in sex for hire, 
especially in times of economic turmoil.62
Despite such changes, the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) 
indicates that about 70,000 prostitution arrests are made 
annually, with the gender ratio about 7:3 female to male.63 
More alarming is the fact that about 1,000 arrests involve 
minors under the age of 18, including about 130 kids aged 
15 and under. Arguments that criminal law should not in-
terfere with sexual transactions because no one is harmed 
are undermined by these disturbing statistics.
Prostitution in Other Cultures
Prostitution fl ourishes abroad and, as noted in Chapter 15, is 
now an important source of income for transnational crimi-
nal syndicates. In some nations, it is legal and regulated by 
the government, while others punish prostitution with the

supervises their behavior, and receives a fee for her services; 
her cut is usually 40 to 60 percent of the prostitute’s earn-
ings. The madam’s role may include recruiting women into 
prostitution and socializing them in the trade.76
Brothels declined in importance following World War II. 
The closing of the last brothel in Texas is chronicled in the 
play and movie The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Today 
the most well-known brothels exist in Nevada, where pros-
titution is legal outside large population centers (one, the 
Mustang Ranch, has an offi cial website that sells souvenirs!). 
Despite their decline, some madams and their brothels have 
achieved national prominence.
Call Girls/Cyberhooking The aristocrats of prostitu-
tion are call girls. Like the Emperor’s Club VIP girls, some 
charge customers thousands per night and net hundreds of 
thousands per year. Some gain clients through employment 
in escort services, and others develop independent customer 
lists. Many call girls come from middle-class backgrounds 
and service upper-class customers. Attempting to dispel the 
notion that their service is simply sex for money, they con-
centrate on making their clients feel important and attrac-
tive. Working exclusively via telephone “dates,” call girls get 
their clients by word of mouth or by making arrangements 
with bellhops, cab drivers, and so on. They either enter-
tain clients in their own apartments or visit clients’ hotels 
and apartments. Upon retiring, a call girl can sell her “date 
book” (listing client names and sexual preferences) for thou-
sands of dollars. Despite the lucrative nature of their busi-
ness, call girls suffer considerable risk by being alone and 
unprotected with strangers. They often request the business 
cards of their clients to make sure they are dealing with “up-
standing citizens.”
streetwalkers to hook clients on their 
charms. It actually stems from the 
popular name given women who fol-
lowed Union General “Fighting Joe” 
Hooker’s army during the Civil War.70 
Because streetwalkers must openly 
display their occupation, they are 
likely to be involved with the police.
Research shows that there are a va-
riety of working styles among women 
involved in street-based prostitution. 
Some are controlled by pimps who 
demand and receive a major share of 
their earnings. Some are independent 
entrepreneurs interested in building a 
stable group of steady clients, while 
others manipulate and exploit their 
customers and may engage in theft 
and blackmail.71
The street life is very dangerous. 
Interviews conducted with 325 sex 
workers in Miami by Hilary Surratt 
and her colleagues found that over 40 
percent experienced violence from clients in the prior year: 
25 percent were beaten, 13 percent were raped, and 14 per-
cent were threatened with weapons.72 If they survive and 
gain experience, street workers learn to adopt sex practices 
that promote their chances of survival, such as refusing to 
trade sex for drugs and refusing to service clients they con-
sider too dangerous or distasteful.73 Teela Sanders’s research 
on the everyday life of British sex workers found that street-
level sex workers use rational decision making and learning 
experiences to reduce the risk of violent victimization. Ex-
perienced sex workers are able to come up with protective 
strategies that help them manage the risk of the profession. 
Most do not randomly accept all clients and eliminate those 
they consider dangerous or threatening. They also develop 
methods to deal with the emotional strain of the work as 
well as techniques to maintain their privacy and keep their 
occupation hidden from family and neighbors.74
Bar Girls B-girls, as they are also called, spend their time 
in bars, drinking and waiting to be picked up by custom-
ers. Although alcoholism may be a problem, B-girls usually 
work out an arrangement with the bartender so they are 
served diluted drinks or water colored with dye or tea, for 
which the customer is charged an exorbitant price. In some 
bars, the B-girl is given a credit for each drink she gets the 
customer to buy. It is common to fi nd B-girls in towns with 
military bases and large transient populations.75
Brothel Prostitutes Also called bordellos, cathouses, sport-
ing houses, and houses of ill repute, brothels fl ourished in 
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They were large 
establishments, usually run by madams that housed several 
prostitutes. A madam is a woman who employs prostitutes,

Moonlite BunnyRanch prostitutes (from left) Nadia Ray, Alexis On Fire, Destiny, and Kandi sit at

as it is in Nevada? Why shouldn’t adults be allowed to hire Destiny and Kandi in Boston and 
Cleveland as they do at the BunnyRanch? Before you answer, consider that it is perfectly legal 
to be a doctor, chiropractor, massage therapist, or personal trainer, and people in these 
professions have physical contact with their clients. We allow liquor to be sold openly and 
people to gamble at casinos. Where should the line be drawn? Are these women being harmed 
by their profession, and does society have a duty to protect them from injury?

and unemployed, and (c) suffered more psychological dis-
tress than crack users who steered clear of the sex trade.80 
Other research studies fi nd that skeezers are less likely to 
have a main sexual partner and more likely to smoke larger 
quantities of crack. Skeezers have lower self-esteem, greater 
depression and anxiety, poorer decision-making confi dence, 
more hostility, less social conformity, greater risk-taking be-
haviors, and more problems growing up, compared to drug 
users who refrain from trading sex.81
Massage Parlors/Photo Studios Some “working girls” 
are based in massage parlors and photo studios. Although 
it is unusual for a masseuse to offer all the services of prosti-
tution, oral sex and manual stimulation are common. Most 
localities have attempted to limit commercial sex in massage 
parlors by passing ordinances specifying that the masseuse 
keep certain parts of her body covered and limiting the ar-
eas of the body that can be massaged. Some photo studios 
allow customers to put body paint on models before the 
photo sessions start.
Becoming a Prostitute
At 38, Lt. Cmdr. Rebecca Dickinson had risen from the en-
listed ranks in the Navy to its offi cer corps. She started her 
Navy career in 1986 as an aviation electronics technician, 
attended Auburn University and the Naval Supply Corps 
School. After becoming a commissioned offi cer, Dickinson 
served on the support ship Camden, the supply ship Santa 
Barbara, and the cruiser Bunker Hill. She was assigned to the 
Naval Academy, where she helped teach a leadership course. 
But faced with money and marital problems, Dickinson 
contacted the D.C. Madam Deborah Jeane Palfrey (whose 
client list included Senator David Vitter) and worked as a 
prostitute for some of the richest and most powerful men 
in Washington. When asked why she did it, she replied, 
“I needed the money.” This desperate Navy offi cer, whose 
career was destroyed in the scandal, was paid $130 for a 
90-minute session.82
Why do people like Lt. Cmdr. Dickinson turn to prostitu-
tion? While she was a successful career offi cer motivated by 
an immediate fi nancial need (she was earning over $75,000 
per year from the Navy), it is more common for male and fe-
male street-level sex workers to come from troubled homes 
marked by extreme confl ict and hostility.83 Many of these 
children experienced sexual trauma at an early age.84 Fu-
ture prostitutes were initiated into sex by family members at 
ages as young as 10 to 12 years; they have long histories of 
sexual exploitation and abuse.85
Sexual abuse is not the only social problem that is a fore-
runner to prostitution. One recent survey of street-level sex 
workers in Phoenix, Arizona, found that women engaging 
in prostitution have limited educational backgrounds; most 
did not complete high school.86 Girls who get into “the life” 
report confl ict with school authorities, poor grades, and an 
The technological revolution has begun to alter the world 
of prostitution. Instead of working with a cell phone, cyber-
prostitutes set up personal websites or put listings on web 
boards, such as Adult FriendFinder, that carry personals. 
They may use loaded phrases such as “looking for generous 
older man” in their self-descriptions. When contacted, they 
ask to exchange e-mails, chat online, or make voice calls 
with prospective clients. They may even exchange pictures. 
This allows them to select whom they want to be with and 
avoid clients who may be threatening or dangerous. Some 
cyberprostitution rings offer customers the opportunity to 
choose women from their Internet page and then have them 
fl own in from around the country.
Escort Services/Call Houses Some escort services are 
fronts for prostitution rings. Both male and female sex 
workers can be sent out after the client calls an ad in the yel-
low pages. Las Vegas has more than 1,000 listings for adult 
services; New York City lists more than 90 escort agencies. 
While most escort agencies deny that they are involved in 
prostitution and claim that their employees never provide 
sexual services, very few are exclusively involved in “so-
cial companionship.” The Internet makes it easy to find 
escort services for travelers: a recent Google search found 
more than a million listings under “adult escort services” 
nationwide.
A relatively new phenomenon, call houses, combines el-
ements of the brothel and call girl rings. A madam receives a 
call from a prospective customer, and if she fi nds the client 
acceptable, she arranges a meeting between the caller and a 
prostitute in her service. The madam maintains a list of pros-
titutes who are on call rather than living together in a house. 
The call house insulates the madam from arrest because she 
never meets the client or receives direct payment.77
Circuit Travelers Prostitutes known as circuit travelers 
move around in groups of two or three to lumber, labor, and 
agricultural camps. They ask the foremen for permission to 
ply their trade, service the whole crew in an evening, and 
then move on. Some circuit travelers seek clients at truck 
stops and rest areas. Sometimes young girls are forced to 
become circuit travelers by unscrupulous pimps who force 
them to work as prostitutes in agricultural migrant camps.78
Skeezers Surveys conducted in New York and Chicago 
have found that a signifi cant portion of female prostitutes 
have substance abuse problems, and more than half claim 
that prostitution is how they support their drug habits; on 
the street, women who barter drugs for sex are called skee-
zers. Not all drug-addicted prostitutes barter sex for drugs, 
but those who do report more frequent drug abuse and sex-
ual activity than other prostitutes.79 In a recent study, Jessica 
Edwards, Carolyn Halpern, and Wendee Wechsberg looked 
into factors that distinguish female crack cocaine users who 
become skeezers and found that they (a) engaged in more 
frequent crack use, (b) were more likely to be homeless

CHAPTER 14 | Public Order Crime: Sex and Substance Abuse  487
Once they fl ee an abusive situation at home, kids are 
vulnerable to life on the streets. Some get hooked up in the 
sex trade, starting as strippers and lap dancers and drifting 
into prostitution and pornography. They remain in the trade 
because they have lost hope and are resigned to their fate.98 
Some meet pimps who quickly turn them to a life of prosti-
tution and beat them if they do not make their daily fi nan-
cial quotas. Others who fl ed to the streets exchange sex for 
money, food, and shelter. Some are traded between prostitu-
tion rings, and others are shipped from city to city and even 
sent overseas as prostitutes. About 20 percent of sexually 
exploited children are involved in prostitution rings that 
work across state lines.
One danger of child prostitution is that it leaves perma-
nent damage. The women Jolanda Sallmann interviewed 
shared stories of feeling permanently altered by their prosti-
tution and substance use. Although the majority of partici-
pants were no longer using substances or exchanging sex, 
they could not escape their past lives. As one interviewee, 
B.T., explained:
B.T.: The damage is done.
Interviewer: And what do you think the damage is?
B.T.: My spirit, my health. Um, my mind, because it’s 
never going to leave me. I’m, you know, even when I’m 
not selling my body, I was still a prostitute. Before in the 
past, you know.
Interviewer: What does that mean?
B.T.: Like once a prostitute always a prostitute. I sold 
my body. For a long time.
Interviewer: So you feel that that is something that 
doesn’t leave you?
B.T.: It doesn’t go away.99
Controlling Prostitution
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, efforts 
were made to regulate prostitution in the United States 
through medical supervision and the licensing and zoning 
of brothels in districts outside residential neighborhoods.100 
After World War I, prostitution became associated with 
disease, and the desire to protect young servicemen from 
harm helped to end almost all experiments with legalization 
in the United States.101 Some reformers attempted to paint 
pimps and procurers as immigrants who used their foreign 
ways to snare unsuspecting American girls into prostitu-
tion. Such fears prompted passage of the federal Mann Act 
(1925), which prohibited bringing women into the country 
or transporting them across state lines for the purposes of 
prostitution. Often called the “white slave act,” it carried a 
$5,000 fi ne, fi ve years in prison, or both.102
Today, prostitution is considered a misdemeanor, pun-
ishable by a fi ne or a short jail sentence. Most states pun-
ish both people engaging in prostitution and those who hire 
overly regimented school experience; a signifi cant portion 
have long histories of drug abuse.87 Young girls who fre-
quently use drugs and begin using at an early age are most 
at risk for prostitution to support their habits.88
Once they get into the life, personal danger begins to 
escalate. Girls who may be directed toward prostitution be-
cause of childhood sexual abuse are also likely to become 
revictimized as adults.89 When sociologist Jolanda Sallmann 
interviewed women with histories of prostitution in the Mid-
west, she discovered that they were hurt when people labeled 
and depersonalized them as “whores” or “hookers.”90 Despite 
their sensitivity, their lives were chaotic. The majority of them 
had suffered physical and/or sexual violence. One woman 
showed Sallmann the scar across her neck where her pimp 
literally slit her throat years earlier. Another woman told how 
she was kidnapped and raped by a client at knifepoint while 
she was still a juvenile. Despite being told that she “was 
gonna die,” she survived the incident. Most self-identifi ed as 
struggling with a substance use problem throughout most or 
all of their involvement in prostitution, typically involving 
crack cocaine, cocaine, and/or heroin.
Considering the linkage between substance abuse and 
prostitution, it is not surprising that the threat of HIV and 
STDs is also a daily worry. Recent research directed at 
the health risks faced by prostitutes found that many suf-
fer from blood-borne viral infections, sexually transmitted 
diseases, and mental health symptoms. Prostitution was 
associated with use of emergency care for women and use 
of inpatient mental health services for men.91 While some 
take precautions, such as using or making their clients use 
condoms, many forgo protection if their pimps and brothel 
owners forbid it or clients refuse to cooperate.92 Their con-
tinuous exposure to danger and violence, both as victims 
and as witnesses, leads many to self-medication with illegal 
drugs. Prostitutes then fi nd themselves in a vicious cycle of 
violence, substance abuse, and AIDS risk.93
Child Sexual Abuse and Prostitution Child prostitution 
is not a recent development. For example, it was routine for 
poor young girls to serve as prostitutes in nineteenth-cen-
tury England.94 In contemporary society, child prostitution 
has been linked to sexual trauma experienced at an early 
age.95 Many have long histories of sexual exploitation and 
abuse.96 The early experiences with sex help teach them 
that their bodies have value and that sexual encounters can 
be used to obtain affection, power, or money. In a detailed 
study of child sexual exploitation in North America, Rich-
ard J. Estes and Neil Alan Weiner found that the problem 
of child sexual abuse is much more widespread than has 
been previously believed or documented.97 Their research 
indicated that each year in the United States, thousands of 
children are subjected to some form of sexual exploitation, 
which often begins with sexual assaults by relatives and ac-
quaintances, such as a teacher, coach, or neighbor. Abusers 
are nearly always men, and about a quarter of them are mar-
ried with children.

prostitutes pay taxes and belong to a union. Other countries, 
such as Australia, allow adults to engage in prostitution but 
regulate their activities, such as requiring that they must get 
timely health checkups. Still other countries, such as Brazil, 
allow women to become prostitutes but criminalize earning 
money from the work of prostitutes—that is, serving as a 
pimp. In the United States, prostitution is illegal in all states, 
though brothels are legal in a number of counties in Nevada 
(but not in Las Vegas or Reno).
Some feminists have staked out confl icting views of pros-
titution. One position is that women must become emanci-
pated from male oppression and reach sexual equality. The 
sexual equality view considers the prostitute a victim of male 
dominance. In patriarchal societies, male power is predicated 
on female subjugation, and prostitution is a clear example of 
this gender exploitation.111 In contrast, for some feminists, 
the fi ght for equality depends on controlling all attempts by 
men (or women) to impose their will on women. The free 
choice view is that prostitution, if freely chosen, expresses 
women’s equality and is not a symptom of subjugation.
Advocates of both positions argue that the penalties for 
prostitution should be reduced (decriminalized); neither side 
advocates outright legalization. Decriminalization would re-
lieve already desperate women of the additional burden of 
severe legal punishment. In contrast, legalization might be 
coupled with regulation by male-dominated justice agencies. 
For example, required medical examinations would mean 
increased governmental control over women’s bodies.
Both positions have had signifi cant infl uence around 
the world. In Sweden, feminists have succeeded in getting 
legislation passed that severely restricts prostitution and 
criminalizes any effort to buy sexual activities.112 In con-
trast, Holland legalized brothels in 2001 but ordered that 
they be run under a strict set of guidelines.113 In England, 
prostitution (taking money for sex) is legal, but soliciting 
in a public place, running a brothel, and acting as a pimp 
are outlawed.114
Should prostitution be legalized? In her book Brothel, 
Alexa Albert, a Harvard-trained physician who interviewed 
young women working at a legal brothel in Nevada, makes a 
compelling case for legalization. She found that the women 
remained HIV-free and felt safer working in a secure envi-
ronment than alone on city streets. Despite long hours and 
rules that gave too much profi t to the owners, the women 
actually took pride in their work. In addition to the added 
security, most earned between $300 and $1,500 per day.115
In opposition to this view, Roger Matthews, author of 
the recent book, Prostitution, Politics and Policy, provides a 
detailed framework that opposes legalizing prostitution. It 
is foolish, he claims, to view prostitution as “sex work” that 
should be either legalized or tolerated and regulated—for 
example, with areas set up, such as Holland’s “tolerance 
zones,” where women can work without fear of arrest. Af-
ter studying street prostitution for more than two decades, 
he concludes that women on the street are extremely des-
perate, damaged, and disorganized. Many are involved in 
people for sexual activities. Take the Minnesota statute for 
example:
Subd. 3. Engaging in, hiring, or agreeing to hire an 
adult to engage in prostitution; penalties. Whoever in-
tentionally does any of the following may be sentenced 
to imprisonment for not more than 90 days or to pay-
ment of a fi ne of not more than $1,000, or both:
(1)  engages in prostitution with an individual 
18 years of age or above; or
(2)  hires or offers or agrees to hire an individual 
18 years of age or above to engage in sexual pen-
etration or sexual contact. Except as otherwise 
provided in subdivision 4, a person who is con-
victed of violating clause (1) or (2) while acting 
as a patron must, at a minimum, be sentenced to 
pay a fi ne of at least $500.103
In practice, most law enforcement is uneven and aims 
at confi ning illegal activities to particular areas in the city.104 
Some local police agencies concerned about prostitution 
have used high-visibility patrols to discourage prostitutes 
and their customers, undercover work to arrest prostitutes 
and drug dealers, and collaboration with hotel and motel 
owners to identify and arrest pimps and drug dealers. 105
There has also been an effort to reduce prostitution and 
protect children forced into the life by punishing sex tour-
ism. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
of 1994 included a provision, referred to as the Child Sexual 
Abuse Prevention Act, which made it a criminal offense to 
travel abroad for the purpose of engaging in sexual activ-
ity with a minor.106 Some loopholes in the law were closed 
when President George W. Bush signed the PROTECT Act 
into law in 2003.107 Despite these efforts, prosecuting sex 
tourists is often tricky due to the diffi culty of gathering evi-
dence of crimes that were committed in other countries and 
that involve minor children.108
Legalize Prostitution?
While most research depicts prostitutes as troubled women 
who have lived troubled lives, there may be a trend for some 
young women to enter the sex trade as a rational choice 
based on economic need. Changing sexual mores help re-
duce or eliminate the stigma attached to prostitution. There 
is even evidence that students turn to prostitution to help 
pay tuition bills.109 One recent research study conducted 
in Australia found that the sex industry has become attrac-
tive to college students as a way to supplement their income 
during a time of reduced government aid and increasing 
educational costs. They view sex work as a “normal” form of 
employment for students seeking to obtain a higher educa-
tion.110 If this more liberal attitude toward prostitution be-
comes normative, should the practice become legal?
In some countries, especially in the Muslim world, pros-
titution carries the death penalty. In others, such as Holland,

and moral ambiguity, a global pornography industry is be-
coming increasingly mainstream, currently generating up to 
$60 billion per year in revenue. In fact, some Internet por-
nography companies are now listed on the NASDAQ stock 
exchange.118 Nonetheless, while adult material has gone 
mainstream, courts have long held that the First Amend-
ment was not intended to protect indecency and therefore 
material considered offensive and obscene can be controlled 
by the rule of law.119
Child Pornography
The use of children in pornography is the most controversial 
and reprehensible aspect of the business. Each year more 
than a million children are believed to be used in pornog-
raphy or prostitution, many of them runaways whose plight 
is exploited by adults.120 Sexual exploitation by child por-
nography rings can devastate victims, causing them physi-
cal problems ranging from headaches and loss of appetite to 
genital pain, vomiting, and urinary tract infections, and psy-
chological problems including mood swings, withdrawal, 
edginess, and nervousness. In cases of extreme, prolonged 
victimization, children may lock on to the sex group’s be-
havior and become prone to further victimization or even 
become victimizers themselves.
Child pornography has become widespread on the In-
ternet. In his book, Beyond Tolerance: Child Pornography on 
the Internet, sociologist Philip Jenkins argues that activists 
are focused on stamping out Internet pornography but that 
they have not focused on its most dangerous form, kiddie 
porn, which sometimes involves pictures of 4- and 5-year-
old girls in sexual encounters.
When an effort is made to target pedophilic websites, in-
vestigators often go in the wrong direction, failing to recog-
nize that most sites are short-lived entities whose addresses 
are passed around to users. Jenkins suggests that kiddie 
porn is best combated by more effective law enforcement: 
instead of focusing on users, efforts should be directed 
against suppliers.121
Virtual Kiddie Porn CGI and other high-tech innova-
tions now make it possible for pornographers to create and 
distribute pornography using virtual images of children. 
Fearing the proliferation of kiddie porn over the Internet, 
Congress enacted the Child Pornography Prevention Act 
of 1996 (CPPA), which outlawed sexually related material 
that used or appeared to use children under 18 engaging in 
sexual conduct. In Ashcroft v. The Free Speech Coalition, the 
Supreme Court struck down sections of the CPPA relating 
to virtual kiddie porn: sexually related material in which an 
actual child appears is illegal, but “virtual” pornography is 
legal. The Court reasoned that real children are not harmed 
in creating material that depicts a virtual child.
In response to the Court’s decision, Congress passed the 
PROTECT Act of 2003 (Prosecutorial Remedies and Other 
substance abuse and suffer beating, rape, and other forms 
of violence on a regular basis. Women who enter prostitu-
tion do so after a childhood punctuated with physical and 
sexual abuse, parental neglect, homelessness, and drug ad-
diction. Prostitution is, he concludes, the world’s most dan-
gerous occupation. His solution is to treat the women forced 
into prostitution as victims and the men who purchase their 
services as criminals. He applauds Sweden’s decision to 
make buying sexual services a crime, thus criminalizing the 
“johns” rather than the women in prostitution. When gov-
ernments legalize prostitution, it leads to a massive expan-
sion of the trade, both legal and illegal.116
PORNOGRAPHY
The term pornography derives from the Greek porne, 
meaning “prostitute,” and graphein, meaning “to write.” In 
the heart of many major cities are stores that display and sell 
books, magazines, and fi lms depicting every imaginable ex-
plicit sex act. Internet superstores claim that they have more 
than 80,000 titles in stock, some for under fi ve dollars, and 
they offer free shipping. The purpose of this material is to 
provide sexual titillation and excitement for paying custom-
ers. Although material depicting nudity and sex is typically 
legal, protected by the First Amendment’s provision limiting 
governmental control of speech, most criminal codes pro-
hibit the production, display, and sale of obscene material.
Obscenity, derived from the Latin caenum, for “fi lth,” 
is defined by Webster’s dictionary as “deeply offensive to 
morality or decency . . . designed to incite to lust or de-
pravity.”117 The problem of controlling pornography centers 
on this defi nition of obscenity. Police and law enforcement 
offi cials can legally seize only material that is judged ob-
scene. But who, critics ask, is to judge what is obscene? At 
one time, such novels as Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller, 
 Ulysses by James Joyce, and Lady Chatterley’s Lover by D. H. 
Lawrence were prohibited because they were considered 
obscene; today they are considered works of great literary 
value. Thus, what is obscene today may be considered so-
cially acceptable at a future time. After all, Playboy and other 
adult magazines, sold openly on most college campuses, 
display nude models in all kinds of sexually explicit poses. 
Though at one time they were considered “racy,” today they 
are relatively tame and you can buy their stock on the New 
York Stock Exchange.
Allowing individual judgments on what is obscene 
makes the Constitution’s guarantee of free speech unwork-
able. Could not anti-obscenity statutes also be used to 
control political and social dissent? The uncertainty sur-
rounding this issue is illustrated by Supreme Court Justice 
Potter Stewart’s famous 1964 statement on how he defi ned 
obscenity: “I know it when I see it.” Because of this legal

The evidence is mixed. Some studies indicate that 
viewing sexually explicit material actually has little effect 
on sexual violence. When Neil Malamuth, Tamara Addi-
son, and Mary Koss surveyed 2,972 male college students, 
they discovered that frequent use of pornography was not 
related to sexual aggression. There were only relatively mi-
nor differences in sexual aggression between men who re-
ported using pornography very frequently when compared 
to those who said they rarely used it at all. However, men 
who were both at high risk for sexual aggression and who 
were very frequent users of pornography were much more 
likely to engage in sexual aggression than their counter-
parts who consumed pornography less frequently. Put sim-
ply, if a person has relatively aggressive sexual inclinations 
resulting from various personal and cultural factors, expo-
sure to pornography may activate and reinforce associated 
coercive tendencies and behaviors. But even high levels of 
exposure to pornography do not turn nonaggressive men 
into sexual predators.123
How might we account for this surprisingly modest 
association?124 It is possible that viewing erotic material 
Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today), which 
outlawed virtual kiddie porn in which it is almost impos-
sible to distinguish the difference between a real child and 
a morphed or created image.122 So, currently, it is illegal to 
use real children in sexually related content in fi lms, pho-
tos, or Internet sites. Material that is not obscene or does 
not use children is constitutionally protected, and the PRO-
TECT Act bans sexually explicit material in which virtual 
children are indistinguishable from real children. Whether it 
can sustain all constitutional challenges remains to be seen. 
The Profi les in Crime feature “Kiddie Porn?” explores this 
issue further.
Does Pornography Cause Violence?
An issue critical to the debate over pornography is whether 
viewing it produces sexual violence or assaultive behavior.

Bundy claimed his murderous rampage was fueled by read-
ing pornography.

Japanese manga drawings of minor females 
being sexually abused by adult males and 
animals. Handley, 39, was indicted after 
U.S. Postal Inspectors searched his home 
and seized additional obscene drawings 
of the sexual abuse of children. On May 
20, 2009, Handley pleaded guilty in Des 
Moines, Iowa, to possessing obscene vi-
sual representations of the sexual abuse 
of children and on February 11, 2010, he 
was sentenced to six months in prison, to 
be followed by three years of supervised 
release.
What is interesting about the case is 
that Handley’s crime involved his receiving 
and possessing sexually explicit drawings 
that were not of actual children but merely 
imaginary renderings (i.e., virtual kid-
die porn). Possession of virtual porn was 
protected by the 2002 case Ashcroft v. 
The Free Speech Coalition, and Handley, 
who was aware of the case, mistakenly 
believed he had a green light to possess 
virtual kiddie porn. He was unaware, 
however, that Congress had passed the 
PROTECT Act, that bans sexually explicit 
materials which are indistinguishable from 
actual photographs. The newer law also 
carries a five-year mandatory minimum 
sentence for “receiving” child pornography. 
With his attorney’s advice, Handler pleaded 
guilty rather than let a jury decide whether 
the material he had received was obscene; 
six months seemed more doable than five 
years.
Do you think Handler got a raw deal? 
Does a cartoon image, even if offensive and 
obscene, really hurt anyone? Is it kiddie 
porn and should it be outlawed?

CHAPTER 14 | Public Order Crime: Sex and Substance Abuse  491
Pornography and the Law
All states and the federal government prohibit the sale and 
production of pornographic material. Child pornography is 
usually a separate legal category that involves either the cre-
ation or reproduction of materials depicting minors engaged 
in actual or simulated sexual activity (“sexual exploitation 
of minors”) or the publication or distribution of obscene, 
indecent, or harmful materials to minors.133 Under existing 
federal law, traffi cking in obscenity (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1462, 
1464, 1466), child pornography (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252), ha-
rassment (18 U.S.C. Sec. 875(c)), illegal solicitation or lur-
ing of minors (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2423(b)), and threatening to 
injure someone (18 U.S.C. Sec. 875(c)) are all felonies pun-
ished by long prison sentences.
While these laws are designed to control obscene mate-
rial, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects 
free speech and prohibits police agencies from limiting the 
public’s right of free expression. This legal protection has 
sent the government along a torturous road in the attempt 
to defi ne when material is criminally obscene and eligible 
for legal control. For example, the Supreme Court held in 
the twin cases of Roth v. United States and Alberts v. California 
that the First Amendment protects all “ideas with even the 
slightest redeeming social importance—unorthodox ideas, 
controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing 
climate of opinion, but implicit in the history of the First 
Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without 
redeeming social importance.”134 In the 1966 case of Mem-
oirs v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court again required that 
for a work to be considered obscene it must be shown to 
be “utterly without redeeming social value.”135 These deci-
sions left unclear how obscenity is defi ned. If a highly erotic 
movie tells a “moral tale,” must it be judged legal even if 95 
percent of its content is objectionable? A spate of movies 
made after the Roth decision alleged that they were educa-
tional so they could not be said to lack redeeming social 
importance. Many state obscenity cases were appealed to 
federal courts so judges could decide whether the fi lms to-
tally lacked redeeming social importance. To rectify the situ-
ation, the Supreme Court redefi ned its concept of obscenity 
in the case of Miller v. California:
The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be 
(a) whether the average person applying contemporary 
community standards would fi nd that the work taken as 
a whole appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the 
work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, 
sexual conduct specifi cally defi ned by the applicable state 
law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks 
serious literary, artistic, political or scientifi c value.136
To convict a person of obscenity under the Miller doctrine, 
the state or local jurisdiction must specifi cally defi ne obscene 
conduct in its statute, and the pornographer must engage 
in that behavior. The Court gave some examples of what is 
considered obscene: “patently offensive representations or 
may act as a safety valve for those whose impulses might 
otherwise lead them to violence. Convicted rapists and 
sex offenders report less exposure to pornography than a 
control group of nonoffenders.125 Viewing prurient mate-
rial may have the unintended side effect of satisfying erotic 
impulses that otherwise might result in more sexually ag-
gressive behavior.
While the pornography–violence link seems modest, 
there is more evidence that people who are predisposed to 
violence and exposed to material that portrays violence, sa-
dism, and women enjoying being raped and degraded are 
also likely to be sexually aggressive toward female victims.126
Individuals who are already predisposed to sexually offend 
may become aroused by pornography exposure and have a 
greater willingness to undertake sexual coercion.127 For ex-
ample, men who engage in domestic violence also tend to 
watch pornography, and those who do are more controlling 
and violent.128
Laboratory experiments conducted by a number of 
leading authorities have found that men exposed to violent 
pornography are more likely to act aggressively and hold 
aggressive attitudes toward women.129 James Fox and Jack 
Levin fi nd it common for serial killers to collect and watch 
violent pornography. Some make their own “snuff” fi lms 
starring their victims.130 On a macro-level, cross-national 
research indicates that nations that consume the highest lev-
els of pornography also have extremely high rape rates.131
However, it is still not certain if such material drives peo-
ple to sexual violence or whether people predisposed to 
sexual violence are drawn to pornography with a violent 
theme. A recent study by Michael Bourke and Andres Her-
nandez compared a group of men who had been convicted 
of possessing kiddie porn, but had no known history with 
“hands-on” sexual abuse, with a second group of child por-
nographers who also had been convicted of sexual offend-
ing. The goal was to determine whether the former group 
of offenders were “merely” collectors of child pornography 
who presented no actual physical risk to children. They 
found that the Internet offenders were signifi cantly more 
likely to have sexually abused a child via a hands-on con-
tact even though they had not been caught or convicted 
and that they were likely to have offended against multiple 
victims.132 While this research doesn’t prove that viewing 
child pornography is a per se cause of child molesting, it 
does indicate there is a high correlation between viewing 
and acting out, but that the association may be hard to de-
ter because a great deal of molestation remains hidden.
Chapter 5 discusses the effects of media on violence. 
As you may recall, while there is some evidence that 
people exposed to violent media will become violent 
themselves, the association is still being debated.

An alternative approach has been to restrict the sale of 
pornography within acceptable boundaries. Some municipal 
governments have tolerated or even established adult enter-
tainment zones in which obscene material can be openly 
sold. In the case of Young v. American Mini Theaters, the Su-
preme Court permitted a zoning ordinance that restricted 
theaters showing erotic movies to one area of the city, even 
though it did not fi nd that any of the movies shown were 
obscene.141 The state, therefore, has the right to regulate 
adult fi lms as long as the public has the right to view them. 
Some jurisdictions have responded by limiting the sale of 
sexually explicit material in residential areas and restricting 
the number of adult stores that can operate in a particular 
area. For example, New York City has enacted zoning that 
seeks to break up the concentration of peep shows, topless 
bars, and X-rated businesses in several neighborhoods, par-
ticularly in Times Square.142 The law forbids sex-oriented 
businesses within 500 feet of residential zones, schools, 
churches, or day care centers. Sex shops cannot be located 
within 500 feet of each other, so concentrated “red light” 
districts must be dispersed. Rather than close their doors, 
sex shops got around the law by adding products like lug-
gage, cameras, T-shirts, and classic fi lms. The courts have 
upheld the law, ruling that stores can stay in business if no 
more than 40 percent of their fl oor space and inventory are 
dedicated to adult entertainment.143
Today, the Internet has become a favored method of de-
livering adult material and one that defi es easy regula-
tion since distribution can be international in scope. The 
topic of Internet porn will be discussed in Chapter 15.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE
Who among us can forget that terrible day in January of 
2008 when the media reported that actor Heath Ledger died 
in his New York apartment at the age of 28? His big break 
had been playing opposite Julia Stiles in the teen movie, 10 
Things I Hate about You. He became an international star with 
his stirring performance as a gay cowboy in Ang Lee’s ac-
claimed fi lm Brokeback Mountain. While some in the media 
speculated about suicide, medical examiners later pinned 
descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions and lewd 
exhibition of the genitals.” In subsequent cases, the Court 
overruled convictions for “offensive” or “immoral” behavior; 
these are not considered obscene. The Miller doctrine has 
been criticized for not spelling out how community stan-
dards are to be determined. Obviously, a plebiscite cannot 
be held to determine the community’s attitude for every trial 
concerning the sale of pornography. Works that are consid-
ered obscene in Omaha might be considered routine in New 
York, but how can we be sure? To resolve this dilemma, the 
Supreme Court articulated in Pope v. Illinois a “reasonable-
ness” doctrine, under which a work is not obscene if a rea-
sonable person applying objective standards would fi nd that 
the material in question has at least some social value:137
The ideas that a work represents need not obtain ma-
jority approval to merit protection, and the value of 
that work does not vary from community to commu-
nity based on the degree of local acceptance it has won. 
The proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary member 
of any given community would fi nd serious value in 
the allegedly obscene material, but whether a reason-
able person would fi nd such value in the material, 
taken as a whole.138

Controlling Pornography
Sex for profit predates Western civilization. Considering 
its longevity, there seems to be little evidence that it can be 
controlled or eliminated by legal means alone. In 1986, the 
Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography advocated 
a strict law enforcement policy to control obscenity, direct-
ing that “the prosecution of obscene materials that portray 
sexual violence be treated as a matter of special urgency.”139 
Since then, there has been a concerted effort by the federal 
government to prosecute adult-movie distributors. Law en-
forcement has been so fervent that industry members have 
fi led suit claiming they are the victims of a “moral crusade” 
by right-wing zealots.140
Although politically appealing, controlling sex for profi t 
is diffi cult because of the public’s desire to purchase sexu-
ally related material and services. Law enforcement crusades 
may not necessarily obtain the desired effect. A get-tough 
policy could make sex-related goods and services scarce, 
driving up prices and making their sale even more desir-
able and profi table. Going after national distributors may 
help decentralize the adult movie and photo business and 
encourage local rings to expand their activities, for example, 
by making and marketing videos as well as still photos or 
distributing them through computer networks.

term “victimless” nonsensical. Still another position is that 
the possession and use of all drugs and alcohol should be le-
galized but that the sale and distribution of drugs should be 
heavily penalized. This would punish those profi ting from 
drugs and would enable users to be helped without fear of 
criminal punishment.
When Did Drug Use Begin?
The use of chemical substances to change reality and to pro-
vide stimulation, relief, or relaxation has gone on for thou-
sands of years. The opium poppy was fi rst cultivated more 
than 5,000 years ago and was used by the Persians, Sumer-
ians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians. Users discov-
ered the bliss that could be achieved by smoking the extract 
derived from crushing the seed pods, which yielded a plea-
surable, peaceful feeling throughout the body. Known as the 
Hul Gil or “plant of joy,” its use spread quickly around the 
fertile crescent.149 The ancient Greeks knew and understood 
the problem of drug use. At the time of the Crusades, the 
Arabs were using marijuana. In the Western hemisphere, na-
tives of Mexico and South America chewed coca leaves and 
used “magic mushrooms” in their religious ceremonies.150
Drug use was also accepted in Europe well into the twen-
tieth century. Recently uncovered pharmacy records circa 
1900 to 1920 showed sales of cocaine and heroin solutions 
to members of the British royal family; records from 1912 
show that Winston Churchill, then a member of Parliament, 
was sold a cocaine solution while staying in Scotland.151
In the early years of the United States, opium and its 
derivatives were easily obtained. Opium-based drugs were 
used in various patent medicine cure-alls. Morphine was 
used extensively to relieve the pain of wounded soldiers in 
the Civil War. By the turn of the century, an estimated 1 mil-
lion U.S. citizens were opiate users.152
Several factors precipitated the current stringent U.S. 
drug laws. The rural religious creeds of the nineteenth 
century—especially those of the Methodists, Presbyterians, 
and Baptists—emphasized individual human toil and self-
suffi ciency while designating the use of intoxicating sub-
stances as an unwholesome surrender to the evils of urban 
morality. Religious leaders were thoroughly opposed to the 
use and sale of narcotics. The medical literature of the late 
1800s began to designate the use of morphine and opium as 
a vice, a habit, an appetite, and a disease. Nineteenth- and 
early twentieth-century police literature described drug us-
ers as habitual criminals. Moral crusaders in the nineteenth 
century defi ned drug use as evil and directed that local and 
national entities should outlaw the sale and possession of 
drugs. Some well-publicized research efforts categorized 
drug use as highly dangerous.153 Drug use was also associ-
ated with the foreign immigrants recruited to work in facto-
ries and mines; they brought with them their national drug 
habits. Early antidrug legislation appears to be tied to preju-
dice against immigrating ethnic minorities.154
Ledger’s death on an accidental overdose of six drugs—
painkillers and sedatives—namely, hydrocodone, diazepam, 
temazepam, alprazolam, and doxylamine (more commonly 
called Vicodin, Valium, Xanax, Restoril, and Unisom) as well 
as Oxycondone. Three of the six prescription drugs found 
in Ledger’s apartment had been fi lled in Europe, where the 
actor was recently fi lming, police said.
The debate over dangerous prescription drug use has 
been intensifi ed because drugs are now easily obtained 
on the Web. Many suppliers do not require prescrip-
tions. For more on this issue, see the discussion in 
Chapter 15 on obtaining dangerous drugs via the Web.
CONNECTIONS
Heath Ledger’s death is a stark reminder of the dangers 
of substance abuse, a social problem that spans every seg-
ment of society. Large urban areas are beset by drug-dealing 
gangs, drug users who engage in crime to support their hab-
its, and alcohol-related violence. Rural areas are important 
staging centers for the shipment of drugs across the coun-
try and are often the production sites for synthetic drugs 
and marijuana farming.144 Nor is the United States alone 
in experiencing a problem with substance abuse. Globally, 
the United Nation’s Offi ce on Drugs and Crime estimates 
that between 155 million and 250 million people (3.5 to 
5.7 percent of the world’s population aged 15 to 64) uses 
illicit substances at least once each year. Globally, marijuana 
users make up the largest number of illicit drug users (129 
to 190 million people), followed by amphetamines, cocaine, 
and opiates. At the core of drug consumption lie the “prob-
lem drug” users: those who inject drugs or are considered 
dependent, facing serious social and health consequences as 
a result. It is now estimated that there are between 16 and 
38 million problem drug users in the world. This represents 
10 to 15 percent of all people who use drugs.145
Another indication of the concern about drugs has been 
the increasing number of drug-related arrests: from less than 
half a million in 1977 to more than 1.6 million today.146
Similarly, the proportion of prison inmates incarcerated for 
drug offenses has increased signifi cantly during the past 30 
years. In 1980, 19,000 people were behind bars for drug 
offenses; today it is 265,000!147 Clearly, the justice system 
views drug abuse as a major problem and is taking what de-
cision makers regard as decisive measures for its control.
Despite the scope of the drug problem, some still view 
it as another type of victimless public order crime. There is 
great debate over the legalization of drugs and the control of 
alcohol. Some consider drug use a private matter and drug 
control another example of government intrusion into peo-
ple’s private lives. Furthermore, legalization could reduce 
the profi t of selling illegal substances and drive suppliers 
out of the market.148 Others see these substances as danger-
ous, believing that the criminal activity of users makes the

law enforcement has become more effi cient at seizing drugs; 
fewer people are using drugs and using them less frequently 
than in the past.
A number of national and international surveys attempt 
to chart trends in drug abuse. Results from some of the most 
important sources are described in the next sections.
United Nations Global Survey The United Nations con-
ducts an annual World Drug Use Survey that monitors drug 
cultivation and use around the globe.159 The most recent 
report on the world drug problem indicates that the drug 
epidemic may be abating, drug cultivation is in decline, and 
law enforcement agencies have become more adept at seiz-
ing drug shipments; the drug crisis of the 1990s seems un-
der control. There is evidence that drug cultivation (opium 
and coca) is fl at or down. Major markets for opiates (Europe 
and Southeast Asia), cocaine (North America), and cannabis 
(North America, Oceania, and Europe) are in decline. The in-
crease in consumption of synthetic stimulants, particularly in 
East Asia and the Middle East, is cause for concern, although 
use is declining in developed countries. Among the fi ndings:
Coca cultivation in the Andean countries continues to 
 
■
fall, driven by signifi cant declines in Colombia. Global 
demand for cocaine has also stabilized, although there 
have been increases in some European countries.
The production and consumption of amphetamine-type 
 
■
stimulants (ATS) has leveled off, with a clear downward 
trend in North America and, to a lesser degree, Europe.
Health warnings on higher potency cannabis appear 
 
■
to be getting through. The global production and con-
sumption of cannabis has declined.
Opium production, while signifi cant, is now highly 
 
■
concentrated in Afghanistan’s southern provinces, espe-
cially in the Taliban-controlled Helmand. If Helmand 
could be “cured” of its insurgency, drug cultivation 
should be signifi cantly curtailed.
Despite a massive increase in opium poppy cultiva-
 
■
tion in Afghanistan, the global area under cultivation 
is now actually 10 percent lower than in 2000. This 
decline was mainly due to sustained success in reducing 
cultivation in Southeast Asia. Poppy cultivation in the 
so-called Golden Triangle has fallen by some 80 percent 
since 2000. Southeast Asia is closing a tragic chapter 
that has blighted the Golden Triangle for decades—the 
region is now almost opium free.
Drug law enforcement has improved: almost half of all 
 
■
cocaine produced is now being intercepted and more 
than a quarter of all heroin shipments are being seized 
by law enforcement agencies each year. The amount of 
heroin available to consumers is actually lower today 
than it was in 1990. Improved cooperation among law 
enforcement bodies has led to improved seizures close 
to the source of cultivation: about 60 percent of global 
cocaine seizures take place in South America, the Carib-
bean, and Central America.
After the Spanish-American War of 1898, the United 
States inherited Spain’s opium monopoly in the Philippines. 
Concern over this international situation, along with the do-
mestic issues just outlined, led the U.S. government to par-
ticipate in the First International Drug Conference, held in 
Shanghai in 1908, and a second one at The Hague in 1912. 
Participants in these two conferences were asked to strongly 
oppose free trade in drugs. The international pressure, cou-
pled with a growing national concern, led to the passage of 
the antidrug laws discussed here.
Alcohol and Its Prohibition
The history of alcohol and the law in the United States has 
also been controversial and dramatic. At the turn of the cen-
tury, a drive was mustered to prohibit the sale of alcohol. 
This temperance movement was fueled by the belief that 
the purity of the U.S. agrarian culture was being destroyed 
by the growth of the city. Urbanism was viewed as a threat to 
the lifestyle of the majority of the nation’s population, then 
living on farms and in villages. The forces behind the tem-
perance movement were such lobbying groups as the Anti-
Saloon League led by Carrie Nation, the Women’s Christian 
Temperance Union, and the Protestant clergy of the Baptist, 
Methodist, and Congregationalist faiths.155 They viewed the 
growing city, fi lled with newly arriving Irish, Italian, and 
Eastern European immigrants, as centers of degradation and 
wickedness. The propensity of these ethnic people to drink 
heavily was viewed as the main force behind their degener-
ate lifestyle. The eventual prohibition of the sale of alcoholic 
beverages brought about by ratifi cation of the Eighteenth 
Amendment in 1919 was viewed as a triumph of the mo-
rality of middle- and upper-class Americans over the threat 
posed to their culture by the “new Americans.”156
Prohibition failed. It was enforced by the Volstead Act, 
which defi ned intoxicating beverages as those containing 
one-half of 1 percent, or more, alcohol.157 What doomed 
Prohibition? One factor was the use of organized crime to 
supply illicit liquor. Also, the law made it illegal only to sell 
alcohol, not to purchase it; this cut into the law’s deterrent 
capability. Finally, despite the work of Eliot Ness and his 
“Untouchables,” law enforcement agencies were inadequate, 
and offi cials were likely to be corrupted by wealthy bootleg-
gers.158 Eventually, in 1933, the Twenty-First Amendment 
to the Constitution repealed Prohibition, signaling the end 
of the “noble experiment.”
The Extent of Substance Abuse
Despite continuing efforts at control, the use of mood-alter-
ing substances persists around the world. What is the extent 
of the substance abuse problem today? This question can be 
answered from both a global and an individual perspective. 
On both fronts, drug use continues at too high a rate, but the 
trends have been positive: fewer drugs are being marketed;

their perception of risk associated with marijuana use; simi-
larly, disapproval of drug use has begun to decline. It is pos-
sible that changing attitudes—less fear, less disapproval—are 
harbingers of increased usage. So while drug use is down, 
many kids continue to use drugs and many students have no 
problem fi nding illegal drugs on campus.161
National Survey on Drug Use and Health Each year, 
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration (SAMHSA), a division of the Department of Health 
and Human Services, conducts the National Survey on Drug 
Use and Health (NSDUH) (the survey was called the Na-
tional Household Survey on Drug Abuse—NHSDA—prior 
to 2002).162 The NSDUH collects information from all U.S. 
residents of households, noninstitutional group quarters 
(such as shelters, rooming houses, dormitories), and civil-
ians living on military bases (it excludes homeless people 
who do not use shelters, military personnel on active duty, 
and residents of institutional group quarters, such as jails 
and hospitals).
The most recent NSDUH survey indicates that, like the 
MTF survey, drug use trends have been relatively stable dur-
ing the past few years with slight declines in the use of most 
illegal substances. Nonetheless, an estimated 20 million 
Americans aged 12 or older had used an illicit drug in the 
past year, including marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including 
crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-
type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically. As Figure 14.2 
shows, marijuana was the most commonly used illicit drug 
The most troubling trend has been a global increase in 
 
■
amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS). Global seizures 
are increasing, and ATS are being made in a growing 
number of countries, with diversifying locations 
and manufacture techniques.
Monitoring the Future (MTF) While the UN survey indi-
cates that on a global scale drug cultivation is down and law 
enforcement efforts are improving, it does not tell us much 
about individual drug use patterns in the United States. To 
answer this question, a number of yearly surveys of drug use 
can be examined. One of the most important, the annual 
Monitoring the Future report, is conducted by the Institute 
of Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan.160 Data 
was collected from the self-report responses of nearly 50,000 
high school students in the 8th, 10th, and 12th grades in al-
most 400 schools across the United States. The survey asked 
students about their yearly and lifetime drug use experiences.
The latest survey (2009) finds that about 15 percent 
of 8th graders, 29 percent of 10th graders, and 37 percent 
of 12th graders say they used some form of illicit drug in 
the past year. While student drug use seems pervasive, as 
 Figure 14.1 shows, American high school students (8th and 
10th graders were added to the survey in 1991) use less fre-
quently than they did in the 1970s and early 1980s (when 
their parents were in high school). While the decline refl ects 
the UN fi ndings, there is also evidence that marijuana use 
has increased slightly over the past few years. One reason for 
the uptick may be that kids are now reporting a decline in

One in four Americans will have an alcohol or drug 
 
■
problem at some point in their lives.
More than 60 million Americans are hooked on 
 
■
cigarettes.
Alcohol abuse is quite common and kids as young as 
 
■
12 may be at risk for binge drinking and/or heavy 
drinking. Slightly more than half of Americans aged 
12 or older reported being current drinkers of alcohol. 
This means that about 127 million Americans drink 
regularly.
More than one-fi fth of persons aged 12 or older par-
 
■
ticipated in binge drinking at least once in the past 30 
days.
Heavy drinking was reported by 7 percent of the popu-
 
■
lation aged 12 or older, or 17 million people.163
Children under the age of 21 drink about 19 percent of 
 
■
the alcohol consumed in the United States. More than 
5 million high school students admit to binge drinking 
at least once a month. The age at which children begin 
drinking is dropping: since 1975, the proportion of 
children who begin drinking in the 8th grade or earlier 
has jumped by almost a third, from 27 percent to 36 
percent.164
While these data are sobering, the report also notes that a 
child who reaches age 21 without smoking, using illegal 
drugs, or abusing alcohol is virtually certain never to do so 
during his or her lifetime.
The problems of self-report surveys were discussed in 
Chapter 2. While the drug surveys may be beset by 
problems of missing subjects and subject reliability, 
they are administered yearly, in a consistent fashion, so 
that the effects of over- and underreporting and missing 
subjects should have a consistent effect in every sur-
vey year. The surveys have attempted to improve their 
methodologies to increase validity. For example, the 
ISR survey now includes 8th and 10th graders in an at-
tempt to survey youths before they drop out of school.
CONNECTIONS
AIDS and Drug Use
Intravenous (IV) drug use is closely tied to the threat of 
AIDS.165 Since monitoring the spread of AIDS began in 
1981, about one-fourth of all adult AIDS cases reported to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta 
have occurred among IV drug users.
One reason for the AIDS–drug use relationship is the 
widespread habit of needle sharing among IV users. One 
study of Los Angeles drug “shooting galleries” conducted 
by researcher Douglas Longshore found that about one-
quarter of users shoot drugs in these abandoned buildings, 
and about 15 million people smoked pot during the past 
month. About half of all people who said they used a single 
drug smoked marijuana. Illicit drugs other than marijuana 
were used by about 10 million people or 47 percent of illicit 
drug users aged 12 or older; about 20 percent used both 
marijuana and other drugs.
National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse 
(CASA) Survey Surveys conducted by the National Center 
on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University 
provide a less sanguine view of substance abuse in America. 
CASA researchers fi nd trends indicating that the problem 
is still signifi cant and that substance abuse touches almost 
every American family. Many of the nation’s most devastat-
ing social problems, including violent and property crimes, 
soaring health care costs, family breakup, domestic violence 
and child abuse, the spread of AIDS, teen pregnancy, pov-
erty, and low productivity, are linked to drugs and alcohol. 
Among their fi ndings:
Americans, comprising only 4 percent of the world’s pop-
 
■
ulation, consume two-thirds of the world’s illegal drugs.
Nearly a quarter of the nation’s college students meet 
 
■
the clinical criteria for alcohol and drug abuse and 
addiction.
Every American child will be offered illegal drugs before 
 
■
graduating from high school, most on several occasions.
Since 1992 the number of Americans abusing con-
 
■
trolled prescription drugs jumped from 8 to 15 million.
There has been no signifi cant improvement for decades 
 
■
in alcoholism and alcohol abuse, with the number of 
alcohol abusers and addicts holding steady at about 16 
to 20 million.

CHAPTER 14 | Public Order Crime: Sex and Substance Abuse  497
abuse is very real. Consequently, some experts have linked 
substance abuse to psychological defi cits such as impaired 
cognitive functioning, personality disturbance, and emo-
tional problems that can strike people in any economic 
class.172 Research on the psychological characteristics of 
drug abusers does in fact reveal the presence of a signifi -
cant degree of personal pathology. Studies have found that 
addicts suffer personality disorders characterized by low 
frustration tolerance, anxiety, and fantasies of omnipo-
tence. Many addicts exhibit psychopathic or sociopathic 
behavior characteristics, forming what is called an addic-
tion-prone personality.173
What is the connection between psychological dis-
order and drug abuse? Drugs may help people deal with 
unconscious needs and impulses and relieve dependence 
and depression. People may turn to drug abuse as a form 
of self-medication in order to reduce the emotional turmoil 
of adolescence, deal with troubling impulses, or cope with 
traumatic life experiences such as institutional child abuse 
(kids who were sexually or physically abused in orphanages, 
mental institutions, juvenile detention centers, day care cen-
ters, etc).174 Survivors of sexual assault and physical abuse in 
the home have also been known to turn to drug and alcohol 
abuse as a coping mechanism.175 Depressed people may use 
drugs as an alternative to more radical solutions to their pain 
such as suicide.176 Kids with low self-esteem, who are self-
conscious about their body image, or who have poor self-
image may turn to drugs to ease psychological turmoil.177
Genetic Factors Research shows that substance abuse 
may have a genetic basis.178 For example, a number of stud-
ies comparing alcoholism among identical twins and frater-
nal twins have found that the degree of concordance (both 
siblings behaving identically) is twice as high among the 
identical twin groups.179
Taken as a group, studies of the genetic basis of sub-
stance abuse suggest that people whose parents were 
alcoholic or drug dependent have a greater chance of de-
veloping a problem than the children of nonabusers, and 
this relationship occurs regardless of parenting style or the 
quality of the parent–child relationship.180 However, not all 
children of abusing parents become drug dependent them-
selves, suggesting that even if drug abuse is heritable, envi-
ronment and socialization must play some role in the onset 
of abuse.181
Social Learning Social psychologists suggest that drug 
abuse may also result from observing parental drug use. 
Parental drug abuse begins to have a damaging effect on 
children as young as two years old, especially when parents 
manifest drug-related personality problems such as depres-
sion or poor impulse control.182 Children whose parents 
abuse drugs are more likely to have persistent abuse prob-
lems than the children of nonabusers.183
People who learn that drugs provide pleasurable sen-
sations may be the most likely to experiment with illegal 
private apartments, or other sites, where for a small entry 
fee injection equipment can be borrowed or rented.166 Most 
users (72 percent) shared needles, and although some tried 
to use bleach as a disinfectant, the majority ignored this 
safety precaution. Asking for or bringing bleach ruined the 
moment for some addicts because it reminded them of the 
risk of AIDS; others were too high to be bothered. As one 
user told Longshore,
After I started shooting coke, all hell broke loose, no 
holds barred, couldn’t be bothered to get bleach. That 
was out of the question. Literally picking needles up 
that I had no idea who had used. . . . I was just out of 
my mind insane. [HIV] wasn’t a consideration. It was 
more like, I hope this is going to be okay. You just aren’t 
in your right mind anymore.167
Efforts to control drugs by outlawing the over-the-counter 
sale of hypodermic needles have encouraged needle sharing. 
Consequently, some jurisdictions have developed outreach 
programs to help these drug users; others have made an effort 
to teach users how to clean their needles and syringes. A few 
states have gone so far as to give addicts sterile needles.168
The threat of AIDS may be changing the behavior of rec-
reational and middle-class users, but drug use may still be 
increasing among the poor, high school dropouts, and other 
disadvantaged groups. If that pattern is correct, then the re-
cently observed decline in substance abuse may be restricted 
to one segment of the at-risk population while another is 
continuing to use drugs at ever-increasing rates.
What Causes Substance Abuse?
What causes people to abuse substances? Although there are 
many different views on the causes of drug use, most can be 
characterized as seeing the onset of an addictive career as 
being either an environmental or a personal matter.
Subcultural View Those who view drug abuse as having 
an environmental basis concentrate on lower-class addic-
tion. Because a disproportionate number of drug abusers 
are poor, the onset of drug use can be tied to such factors 
as racial prejudice, devalued identities, low self-esteem, 
poor socioeconomic status, and the high level of mistrust, 
negativism, and defi ance found in impoverished areas. Resi-
dents feel trapped in a cycle of violence, drug abuse, and 
despair.169 Youths in these disorganized areas may join peers 
to learn the techniques of drug use and receive social sup-
port for their habit. Research shows that peer infl uence is 
a significant predictor of drug careers that actually grow 
stronger as people mature.170 Drug use splits some com-
munities into distinct groups of relatively affl uent abstainers 
and desperately poor abusers.171
Psychological View Not all drug abusers reside in lower-
class slum areas; the problem of middle-class substance

“Adults who gave children alcohol,” they argue, “were also 
giving them a head start in a delinquent career.”195 Other 
research efforts support this view when they fi nd that the 
most serious drug users have a history of recreational drug 
and alcohol abuse.196 Kids who begin using alcohol in ado-
lescence become involved in increasing levels of deviant 
behavior as they mature.197 However, a recent longitude 
analysis by Cesar Rebellon and Karen van Gundy found evi-
dence that marijuana users are up to fi ve times more likely 
to escalate their drug abuse and try cocaine and heroin than 
nonusers.198 In sum, while most marijuana smokers do not 
become hard drug users, some do, and the risk of using 
dangerous substances may be increased by fi rst engaging in 
recreational drugs.
The drug gateway vision is popular, but not all research 
efforts fi nd that users progress to ever more potent drugs, 
and some show that, surprisingly, many hardcore drug 
abusers never actually smoked pot or used alcohol.199 And 
although many American youths have tried marijuana, few 
actually progress to crack or heroin abuse.200
Types of Drug Users and Abusers
The general public often groups all drug users together 
without recognizing that there are many varieties, ranging 
from adolescent recreational drug users to adults who run 
large smuggling operations.201
Adolescents who distribute small amounts of drugs. 
 
■
Some 
dealers began their involvement in the drug trade by 
using and distributing small amounts of drugs; they do 
not commit any other serious criminal acts. Some start 
out as “stash dealers” who sell drugs to maintain a con-
sistent access to drugs for their own consumption; their 
customers are almost always personal acquaintances, 
including friends and relatives.202 They are insulated 
from the legal system because their activities rarely re-
sult in apprehension and sanction.
Adolescents who frequently sell drugs. 
 
■
A small number 
of adolescents, most often multiple-drug users or 
heroin or cocaine users, are high-rate dealers who 
bridge the gap between adult drug distributors and 
the adolescent user. Frequent dealers often have adults 
who “front” for them—that is, loan them drugs to sell 
without upfront cash. The teenagers then distribute 
the drugs to friends and acquaintances, returning 
most of the proceeds to the supplier while keeping a 
commission for themselves. Frequent dealers are more 
likely to sell drugs in public and can be seen in known 
drug user hangouts in parks, schools, or other public 
places. Deals are irregular, so the chances of apprehen-
sion are slight.
Teenage drug dealers who commit other delinquent acts. 
 
■
A 
more serious type of drug-involved youth comprises 
those who use and distribute multiple substances and 
substances; a habit may develop if the user experiences 
lower anxiety, fear, and tension levels.184 Having a history 
of family drug and alcohol abuse has been found to be a 
characteristic of violent teenage sexual abusers.185 Heroin 
abusers report an unhappy childhood that included harsh 
physical punishment and parental neglect and rejection.186
Problem Behavior Syndrome (PBS) For many people, 
substance abuse is just one of many problem behaviors.187 
Longitudinal studies show that drug abusers are malad-
justed, alienated, and emotionally distressed.188 Having a 
deviant lifestyle begins early in life and is punctuated with 
criminal relationships, family history of substance abuse, ed-
ucational failure, and alienation. Crack cocaine use has been 
linked to sexual abuse as children and to social isolation as 
adults.189 There is robust support for the interconnection of 
problem drinking and drug abuse, delinquency, precocious 
sexual behavior, school failure, running away, homelessness, 
family confl ict, and other similar social problems.190
Rational Choice Not all people who abuse drugs do so 
because of personal pathology. Some may use drugs and 
alcohol because they want to enjoy their effects: get high, 
relax, improve creativity, escape reality, and increase sexual 
responsiveness. Research indicates that adolescent alcohol 
abusers believe that getting high will make them power-
ful, increase their sexual performance, and facilitate their 
social behavior; they care little about negative future con-
sequences.191 Claire Sterk-Elifson’s research on middle-class 
drug-abusing women shows that most were introduced by 
friends in the context of “just having some fun.”192
Substance abuse, then, may be a function of the ra-
tional but mistaken belief that drugs can benefi t the user. 
The decision to use drugs involves evaluations of personal 
consequences (such as addiction, disease, and legal punish-
ment) and the expected benefi ts of drug use (such as peer 
approval, positive affective states, heightened awareness, 
and relaxation). Adolescents may begin using drugs because 
they believe their peers expect them to do so.193
Is There a Drug Gateway?
Some experts believe that, regardless of its cause, most peo-
ple fall into drug abuse slowly, beginning with alcohol and 
then following with marijuana and more serious drugs as 
the need for a more powerful high intensifi es. A number of 
research efforts have confi rmed this gateway model. James 
Inciardi, Ruth Horowitz, and Anne Pottieger found a clear 
pattern of adult involvement in adolescent drug abuse. Kids 
on crack started their careers with early experimentation 
with alcohol at age 7, began getting drunk at age 8, had al-
cohol with an adult present by age 9, and became regular 
drinkers by the time they were 11 years old.194 Drinking 
with an adult present, presumably a parent, was a signifi -
cant precursor of future substance abuse and delinquency.

by competitors or disgruntled customers; a few wind 
up in jail or prison.
Smugglers. 
 
■
Smugglers import drugs into the United 
States. They are generally men, middle-aged or older, 
who have strong organizational skills, established con-
nections, capital to invest, and a willingness to take 
large business risks. Smugglers are a loosely organized, 
competitive group of individual entrepreneurs. There 
is a constant fl ow in and out of the business as some 
sources become the target of law enforcement activities, 
new drug sources become available, older smugglers 
become dealers, and former dealers become smugglers.
Adult predatory drug users who are frequently arrested. 
 
■
Many users who begin abusing substances in early 
adolescence continue in drugs and crime in their adult-
hood. Getting arrested, doing time, using multiple 
drugs, and committing predatory crimes are a way of 
life for them. They have few skills, did poorly in school, 
and have long criminal records. The threat of conviction 
and punishment has little effect on their criminal activi-
ties. These “losers” have friends and relatives involved 
in drugs and crime. They specialize in robberies, bur-
glaries, thefts, and drug sales. They fi lter in and out of 
the justice system and begin committing crimes again as 
soon as they are released. In some populations, at least 
one-third of adult males are involved in drug traffi cking 
and other criminal acts well into their adulthood.206
  
If they make a “big score,” perhaps through a suc-
cessful drug deal, they may signifi cantly increase their 
drug use. Their increased narcotics consumption then 
destabilizes their lifestyle, destroying family and career 
ties. When their fi nances dry up, they may become 
street junkies, people whose traditional lifestyle has 
been destroyed, who turn to petty crime to maintain an 
adequate supply of drugs. Cut off from a stable source 
of quality heroin, not knowing from where their next 
fi xes or the money to pay for them will come, look-
ing for any opportunity to make a buck, getting sick 
or “jonesing,” being pathetically unkempt and unable 
to maintain even the most primitive routines of health 
or hygiene, street junkies live a very diffi cult existence. 
Because they are unreliable and likely to become police 
informants, street junkies pay the highest prices for 
the poorest quality heroin; lack of availability increases 
their need to commit habit-supporting crimes.207
Adult predatory drug users who are rarely arrested. 
 
■
Some 
drug users are “winners.” They commit hundreds of 
crimes each year but are rarely arrested. On the streets, 
they are known for their calculated violence. Their 
crimes are carefully planned and coordinated. They 
often work with partners and use lookouts to carry out 
the parts of their crimes that have the highest risk of 
apprehension. These “winners” are more likely to use 
recreational drugs, such as coke and pot, than the more 
addicting heroin or opiates. Some become high-fre-
quency users and risk apprehension and punishment. 
also commit both property and violent crimes; many are 
gang members.203 Although these youngsters make up 
about 2 percent of the teenage population, they commit 
40 percent of the robberies and assaults and about 60 
percent of all teenage felony thefts and drug sales.
  
These youths are frequently hired by older deal-
ers to act as street-level drug runners. Each member of 
a crew of 3 to 12 boys will handle small quantities of 
drugs, perhaps three bags of heroin, which are received 
on consignment and sold on the street; the supplier 
receives 50 to 70 percent of the drug’s street value. 
The crew members also act as lookouts, recruiters, and 
guards. Between drug sales, the young dealers commit 
robberies, burglaries, and other thefts.204
Adolescents who cycle in and out of the justice system. 
 
■
Some drug-involved youths are failures at both dealing 
and crime. They do not have the savvy to join gangs 
or groups and instead begin committing unplanned, 
 opportunistic crimes that increase their chances of 
 arrest. They are heavy drug users, which both increases 
apprehension risk and decreases their value for or-
ganized drug distribution networks. Drug-involved 
“losers” can earn a living steering customers to a seller 
in a “copping” area, “touting” drug availability for a 
dealer, or acting as a lookout. However, they are not 
considered trustworthy or deft enough to handle drugs 
or money. They may bungle other criminal acts, which 
solidifi es their reputation as undesirable.
Drug-involved youth who continue to commit crimes as 
 
■
adults. Although about two-thirds of substance-abusing 
youths continue to use drugs after they reach adult-
hood, about half desist from other criminal activities. 
Those who persist in both substance abuse and crime 
as adults exhibit a garden variety of social and develop-
mental problems. Some evidence also exists that these 
drug-using persisters have low nonverbal IQs and poor 
physical coordination.
Outwardly respectable adults who are top-level dealers. 
 
■
A few outwardly respectable adult dealers sell large 
quantities of drugs to support themselves in high-class 
lifestyles. Outwardly respectable dealers often seem in-
distinguishable from other young professionals. Upscale 
dealers seem to drift into dealing from many different 
walks of life. Some begin as campus dealers whose 
lifestyle and outward appearance are similar to other 
students (though they are more frequently involved in 
illegal behavior outside of drug dealing).205 Frequently 
they are drawn from professions and occupations that 
are unstable, have irregular working hours, and ac-
cept drug abuse. Former graduate students, musicians, 
performing artists, and barkeepers are among those 
who are likely to fi t the profi le of the adult who begins 
dealing drugs in his or her 20s. Some use their business 
skills and drug profi ts to get into legitimate enterprises 
or illegal scams. Others drop out of the drug trade be-
cause they are the victims of violent crime committed

men to use addictive drugs, research conducted by 
CASA found that 15 million girls and women use illicit 
drugs or abuse controlled prescription drugs, 32 mil-
lion smoke cigarettes, and 6 million are alcohol abusers 
and alcoholics. Substance abuse is nondiscriminatory 
and affects all women—rich, poor, young, old, urban, 
rural, professional, and homemaker.213
  
Though infrequently violent criminals, women who 
abuse substances are more likely to get involved in 
prostitution and low-level drug dealing; a few become 
top-level dealers. Many are pregnant or are already 
mothers, and because they share needles, they are at 
high risk of contracting AIDS and passing the HIV virus 
to their newborn children. They maintain a high risk 
of victimization. One study of 171 women using crack 
cocaine found that since initiating crack use, 62 percent 
of the women reported suffering a physical attack and 
32 percent suffered rape; more than half were forced to 
seek medical care for their injuries.214
Drugs and Crime
One of the main reasons for the criminalization of particular 
substances is the assumed association between drug abuse 
and crime.215 Research shows that almost 4 in 10 violent 
crimes and fatal motor vehicle accidents involve alcohol.216 
A number of sources indicate a strong connection between 
drug use and crime.
User Surveys Numerous self-report studies have exam-
ined the criminal activity of drug users. As a group, they 
show that people who take drugs also have extensive in-
volvement in crime.217 Youths who abuse alcohol are also 
the most likely to engage in violence during their life course; 
violent adolescents report histories of alcohol abuse; adults 
with long histories of drinking are also more likely to report 
violent offending patterns.218 Surveys show that youths who 
self-report delinquent behavior are also more likely to use 
illicit drugs. Kids who were involved in serious brawls or 
theft were signifi cantly more likely to use drugs than those 
who did not engage in such antisocial behaviors.219
Arrestee Data According to the National Survey on Drug 
Use and Health:
Adults who were arrested in the past year for any seri-
 
■
ous violent or property offense were more than four 
times as likely to have used an illicit drug in the past 
year than those who were not arrested for a serious 
 offense (60 percent versus 14 percent).
Adults who had been arrested for serious violent or 
 
■
property offenses in the past year were more likely than 
those not arrested for serious offenses to have used 
marijuana (and cocaine, crack cocaine, hallucinogens, 
methamphetamines, heroin, and prescription drugs) 
nonmedically.220
But for the lucky few, their criminal careers can stretch 
for up to 15 years without interruption by the jus-
tice system. These users are sometimes referred to as 
 stabilized junkies who have learned the skills needed to 
purchase and process larger amounts of heroin. Their 
addiction enables them to maintain normal lifestyles, al-
though they may turn to drug dealing to create contacts 
with drug suppliers. They are employable, but earning 
legitimate income does little to reduce their drug use or 
dealing activities.208
Less predatory drug-involved adult offenders. 
 
■
Most adult 
drug users are petty criminals who avoid violent crime. 
These occasional users are people just beginning their 
addiction, who use small amounts of narcotics, and 
whose habit can be supported by income from conven-
tional jobs; narcotics have relatively little infl uence on 
their lifestyles.209 They are typically high school gradu-
ates and have regular employment that supports their 
drug use. They usually commit petty thefts or pass bad 
checks. They stay on the periphery of the drug trade 
by engaging in such acts as helping addicts shoot up, 
bagging drugs for dealers, operating shooting galleries, 
renting needles and syringes, and selling small amounts 
of drugs. These petty criminal drug users do not have 
the stomach for a life of hard crime and drug dealing. 
They violate the law in proportion to the amount and 
cost of the drugs they are using. Pot smokers have a sig-
nifi cantly lower frequency of theft violations than daily 
heroin users, whose habit is considerably more costly.
Outwardly respectable adults who are frequent users. 
 
■
Some 
drug users continue their activities into their adulthood 
while others may initiate drug use as part of a new life-
style developed in adulthood. Although these users may 
be successful college graduates, they become caught 
up in the club scene in major cities and get involved in 
 recreational drug use. Surveys of urban young adults 
fi nd that almost 40 percent report usage of at least 
one club drug.210
  
Another element of the outwardly respectable adult 
drug abuser uses illegal substances to enhance their 
professional careers. The sports world has been rocked 
with stories of famed athletes who have admitted taking 
performance-enhancing drugs. Recent research shows 
that professional ballet dancers, a group not usually 
suspected to be drug involved, routinely use banned 
substances to improve performance.211
  
The number of outwardly respectable drug users is 
expected to rise as the aging baby boomers, who grew 
up in the drug culture, both live longer and continue to 
use banned substances. Evidence shows that this group, 
who may amount to 70 million people by 2030, will 
continue to use illegal substances in amounts unheard 
of for people of their age and lifestyle.212
Drug-involved female offenders. 
 
■
Women who are drug-
 involved offenders constitute a separate type of sub-
stance abuser. Although women are far less likely than

be underemployed, engage in premarital sex, and be-
come unmarried parents.226 Social problems and not 
drug use are the cause of crime.
Considering these scenarios, it is still impossible to make 
a defi nitive statement such as “drugs cause crime.” Some 
studies fi nd an association but also conclude that it is too 
weak to be considered “causal.” In one recent study,  Arielle 
Baskin-Sommers and Ira Sommers conducted in-depth life 
history interviews with more than 100 individuals who 
had been using methamphetamine for a minimum of three 
months. They found that only one-third of these hardcore 
drug users engaged in violence; the remaining two-thirds of 
the meth heads remained nonviolent. Sommers and Som-
mers conclude that while drug use may be a risk factor for 
violence, the fact that most meth users are nonviolent shows 
that the connection is not causal. Even the most chronic us-
ers may not commit other crimes.227
In sum, there is not conclusive evidence that taking 
drugs turns otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals. 
Nonetheless, as addiction levels increase, so too does the 
frequency and seriousness of criminality. Even if the crime 
rate of drug users were actually half that reported in the re-
search literature, users would be responsible for a signifi cant 
portion of the total criminal activity in the United States.
Drugs and the Law
The federal government first initiated legal action to cur-
tail the use of some drugs early in the twentieth century. In 
1906, the Pure Food and Drug Act required manufacturers 
to list the amounts of habit-forming drugs in products on the 
labels but did not restrict their use. However, the act prohib-
ited the importation and sale of opiates except for medici-
nal purposes. In 1914, the Harrison Narcotics Act restricted 
importation, manufacture, sale, and dispensing of narcotics. 
It defi ned narcotic as any drug that produces sleep and re-
lieves pain, such as heroin, morphine, and opium. The act 
was revised in 1922 to allow importation of opium and coca 
(cocaine) leaves for qualifi ed medical practitioners. The Mar-
ijuana Tax Act of 1937 required registration and payment of 
a tax by all who imported, sold, or manufactured marijuana. 
Because marijuana was classifi ed as a narcotic, those register-
ing would also be subject to criminal penalty.
In later years, other federal laws were passed to clarify 
existing drug statutes and revise penalties. For example, the 
Boggs Act of 1951 provided mandatory sentences for violat-
ing federal drug laws. The Durham-Humphrey Act of 1951 
made it illegal to dispense barbiturates and amphetamines 
without a prescription. The Narcotic Control Act of 1956 in-
creased penalties for drug offenders. In 1965, the Drug Abuse 
Control Act set up stringent guidelines for the legal use and 
sale of mood-modifying drugs, such as barbiturates, amphet-
amines, LSD, and any other “dangerous drugs,” except narcot-
ics prescribed by doctors and pharmacists. Illegal possession 
Correctional Surveys Other indicators of a drug–crime 
connection are correctional surveys that disclose that many 
convicted criminals are lifelong substance abusers.221 The 
most recent surveys show that the drug use rate among pa-
rolees is double that of the general population. Similarly, 
about 24 percent of adults on probation reported drug abuse, 
more than double the rate of the general population.222
A recent (2010) survey by CASA found that approxi-
mately 85 percent of current inmates could benefit from 
drug abuse treatment. CASA estimates that 1.5 million of 
the current 2.3 million prison inmates meet the clinical cri-
teria for substance abuse or addiction. Another 458,000 in-
mates have a history of substance abuse and either:
Were under the infl uence of alcohol or other drugs at 
 
■
the time of their crime, or
Committed their offense to get money to buy drugs, or
 
■
Were incarcerated for alcohol or drug law violations
 
■
The CASA study also found that alcohol and drugs are 
signifi cant factors in the commission of many crimes. Alco-
hol and drugs are involved in the following:
78 percent of violent crimes
 
■
83 percent of property crimes
 
■
77 percent of weapon offenses
 
■
77 percent of probation or parole violations
 
■
223
These data seem to show a powerful connection between 
drug abuse, crime, and punishment.
Is There a Drug–Crime Connection? It is of course pos-
sible that most criminals are not actually drug users but that 
police are more likely to apprehend muddle-headed sub-
stance abusers than clear-thinking abstainers. A second, and 
probably more plausible, interpretation is that most crimi-
nals are in fact substance abusers.
Although the drug–crime connection is powerful, the 
true relationship is still uncertain because many users had 
a history of criminal activity before the onset of their sub-
stance abuse. It is possible that:
Chronic criminal offenders begin to abuse drugs and 
 
■
alcohol after they have engaged in crime; that is, crime 
causes drug abuse.
Substance abusers turn to a life of crime to support 
 
■
their habits; that is, the economics of drug abuse causes 
crime. Rich drug users don’t commit crime.
Drug use and crime co-occur in individuals; that is, 
 
■
both crime and drug abuse are caused by some other 
common factor. For example, risk takers may abuse 
drugs and also commit crime.224
Drug users engage in activities that involve them with 
 
■
peers who encourage them to commit crime or support 
their criminal activity.225 Kids who join gangs are more 
likely later to abuse substances and commit crime.
Drug abusers face social problems that lead them to 
 
■
crime. They are more likely to drop out of school,

known international drug dealers and deter those who are 
considering entering the drug trade. A major effort has 
been made to cut off supplies of drugs by destroying over-
seas crops and arresting members of drug cartels in Cen-
tral and South America, Asia, and the Middle East, where 
many drugs are grown and manufactured. The federal gov-
ernment has been in the vanguard of encouraging export-
ing nations to step up efforts to destroy drug crops and 
prosecute dealers. However, translating words into deeds 
is a formidable task. Drug lords are willing and able to 
fi ght back through intimidation, violence, and corruption 
when necessary.
The amount of narcotic materials grown each year is so 
vast that even if three-quarters of the opium crop were de-
stroyed, the U.S. market would still require only 10 percent 
of the remainder to sustain the drug trade. Radically reducing 
the amount of illegal drugs produced each year might have 
little effect on U.S. consumption. Drug users in the United 
States are more able and willing to pay for drugs than anyone 
else in the world. Even if the supply were reduced, whatever 
drugs there were would fi nd their way to the United States.
Adding to control problems is the fact that the drug trade 
is an important source of foreign revenue, and destroying the 
drug trade undermines the economies of third-world nations. 
Even if the government of one nation was willing to cooper-
ate in vigorous drug suppression efforts, suppliers in other 
nations, eager to cash in on the sellers’ market, would be 
encouraged to turn more acreage over to coca or poppy pro-
duction. Today, almost every Caribbean country is involved 
with narcotics traffi cking and, in the case of Jamaica, large-
scale production and export of marijuana. Illicit drug ship-
ments in the region are worth more money than the top fi ve 
legitimate exports combined. Drug gangs are able to corrupt 
the political structure and destabilize countries. Drug addic-
tion and violent crime are now common in Jamaica, Puerto 
Rico, and even small islands like St. Kitts. The corruption of 
the police and other security forces has reached a crisis point 
in Jamaica, where an offi cer can earn the equivalent of half a 
year’s salary by simply looking the other way on a drug deal. 
In 2006, 1,300 Jamaicans were murdered in drug crimes out 
a population of only 3 million—and that was an improve-
ment on the previous year.232 There are also indications that 
the drug syndicates may be planting a higher yield variety of 
coca and improving refi ning techniques to replace crops lost 
to government crackdowns.
Adding to the problem of source control is the fact that 
the United States has little influence in some key drug-
producing areas.233 War and terrorism make source con-
trol strategies problematic. After the United States toppled 
Afghanistan’s Taliban government, the remnants began to 
grow and sell poppy to support their insurgency; Afghani-
stan now supplies 90 percent of the world’s opium.234 Simi-
larly, cocaine production is surging in Peru’s remote tropical 
valleys, helping make it a contender to surpass Colombia as 
the world’s largest exporter of cocaine. One reason is that 
the anti-government Shining Path guerrillas are competing 
was punished as a misdemeanor and manufacture or sale as a 
felony. And in 1970, the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preven-
tion and Control Act set up unifi ed categories of illegal drugs 
and associated penalties with their sale, manufacture, or pos-
session. The law gave the U.S. attorney general discretion to 
decide in which category to place any new drug.
Since then, various federal laws have attempted to in-
crease penalties imposed on drug smugglers and limit the 
manufacture and sale of newly developed substances. For 
example, the 1984 Controlled Substances Act set new, strin-
gent penalties for drug dealers and created fi ve categories 
of narcotic and non-narcotic substances subject to federal 
laws.228 The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 again set new 
standards for minimum and maximum sentences for drug 
offenders, increased penalties for most offenses, and created 
a new drug penalty classification for large-scale offenses 
(such as traffi cking in more than one kilogram of heroin), 
for which the penalty for a fi rst offense was 10 years to life in 
prison.229 With President George H. W. Bush’s endorsement, 
Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which 
created a coordinated national drug policy under a “drug 
czar,” set treatment and prevention priorities, and, symbol-
izing the government’s hard-line stance against drug deal-
ing, imposed the death penalty for drug-related killings.230
For the most part, state laws mirror federal statutes. 
Some states now apply extremely heavy penalties for sell-
ing or distributing dangerous drugs, involving long prison 
sentences of up to 25 years.
Drug-Control Strategies
Substance abuse remains a major social problem in the 
United States. Politicians looking for a safe campaign issue 
can take advantage of the public’s fear of drug addiction 
by calling for a war on drugs. These wars have been de-
clared even when drug usage is stable or in decline.231 Can 
these efforts pay off? Can illegal drug use be eliminated or 
controlled?
A number of different drug-control strategies have been 
tried with varying degrees of success. Some aim to deter 
drug use by stopping the fl ow of drugs into the country, ap-
prehending and punishing dealers, and cracking down on 
street-level drug deals. Others focus on preventing drug use 
by educating potential users to the dangers of substance 
abuse (convincing them to “say no to drugs”) and by orga-
nizing community groups to work with the at-risk popula-
tion in their area. Still another approach is to treat known 
users so they can control their addictions. Some of these ef-
forts are discussed here.
Source Control One approach to drug control is to de-
ter the sale and importation of drugs through the system-
atic apprehension of large-volume drug dealers, coupled 
with the enforcement of strict drug laws that carry heavy 
penalties. This approach is designed to capture and punish

CHAPTER 14 | Public Order Crime: Sex and Substance Abuse  503
Punishment Strategies  Even if law enforcement efforts 
cannot produce a general deterrent effect, the courts may 
achieve the required result by severely punishing known 
drug dealers and traffi ckers. A number of initiatives have 
made the prosecution and punishment of drug offenders a 
top priority. State prosecutors have expanded their investi-
gations into drug importation and distribution and created 
special prosecutors to focus on drug dealers. Once con-
victed, drug dealers can get very long sentences.
However, these efforts often have their downside. Defense 
attorneys consider delay tactics to be sound legal maneuver-
ing in drug-related cases. Courts are so backlogged that pros-
ecutors are anxious to plea bargain. The consequence of this 
legal maneuvering is that about 25 percent of people con-
victed on federal drug charges are granted probation or some 
other form of community release. Even so, prisons have be-
come jammed with inmates, many of whom were involved 
in drug-related cases. Many drug offenders sent to prison do 
not serve their entire sentences because they are released in 
an effort to relieve prison overcrowding. The mean sentence 
for drug traffi cking is 55 months, but the actual time served 
is 24 months or about half of the original sentence.238
It is unlikely that the public would approve of a drug-con-
trol strategy that locks up large numbers of traffi ckers; research 
indicates that the public already believes drug traffi cking pen-
alties are too harsh (while supporting the level of punishment 
for other crimes).239 And some critics are disturbed because 
punishment strategies seem to have a disproportionate effect 
on minority group members and the impoverished. Some 
have gone as far as suggesting that government agencies are 
either ignoring or covering up the toll harsh drug penalties 
have on society’s disadvantaged because it is politically expe-
dient to be a tough defender of the nation’s moral climate.240
Community Strategies Another type of drug-control ef-
fort relies on the involvement of local community groups 
to lead the fi ght against drugs. Representatives of various 
local government agencies, churches, civic organizations, 
and similar institutions are being brought together to create 
drug prevention and awareness programs.
Citizen-sponsored programs attempt to restore a sense 
of community in drug-infested areas, reduce fear, and pro-
mote conventional norms and values.241 These efforts can 
be classifi ed into one of four distinct categories:242
Law enforcement–type efforts, which may include block 
 
■
watches, cooperative police–community efforts, and citizen 
patrols. Some of these citizen groups are nonconfron-
tational: they simply observe or photograph dealers, 
write down their license plate numbers, and then no-
tify police. On occasion, telephone hotlines have been 
set up to take anonymous tips on drug activity. Other 
groups engage in confrontational tactics that may even 
include citizen arrests. Area residents have gone as far 
as contracting with private security fi rms to conduct 
neighborhood patrols.
with outside groups from Mexico and Colombia to control 
the cocaine trade. In April 2010, the Shining Path killed two 
government agents and one police offi cer in central Peru 
who were trying to eradicate the cocaine fields. Despite 
government efforts, Peruvian traffi ckers export more than 
280 tons of cocaine annually, which some believe is 50 tons 
more than Colombian exports.235
Interdiction Strategies Law enforcement efforts have 
also been directed at intercepting drug supplies as they en-
ter the country. Border patrols and military personnel us-
ing sophisticated hardware have been involved in massive 
interdiction efforts; many impressive multimillion-dollar 
seizures have been made. Yet the U.S. borders are so vast 
and unprotected that meaningful interdiction is impossible. 
And even if all importation were shut down, homegrown 
marijuana and laboratory-made drugs, such as “ice,” LSD, 
and PCP, could become the drugs of choice. Even now, their 
easy availability and relatively low cost are increasing their 
popularity among the at-risk population.
Law Enforcement Strategies Local, state, and federal 
law enforcement agencies have been actively fi ghting against 
drugs. One approach is to direct efforts at large-scale drug 
rings. The long-term consequence has been to decentral-
ize drug dealing and has encouraged new groups to be-
come major suppliers. Asian, Latin American, and Jamaican 
groups, motorcycle clubs, and local gangs, such as the Crips 
and Bloods, are all now involved in large-scale dealing. Co-
lombian syndicates have established cocaine distribution 
centers on every continent, and Mexican organizations are 
responsible for large methamphetamine shipments to U.S., 
Russian, Turkish, Italian, Nigerian, Chinese, Lebanese, and 
Pakistani heroin traffi cking syndicates, which are now com-
peting for dominance.
Police can also target, intimidate, and arrest street-level 
dealers and users in an effort to make drug use so much of 
a hassle that consumption is cut back and the crime rate 
reduced. Approaches that have been tried include reverse 
stings, in which undercover agents pose as dealers to arrest 
users who approach them for a buy.
In terms of weight and availability, there is still no com-
modity more lucrative than illegal drugs. They cost rela-
tively little to produce and provide large profi t margins to 
dealers and traffi ckers. At an average street price of $118 
per gram in the United States (the current price according 
to the Offi ce of National Drug Control Policy), a metric ton 
of pure cocaine is worth more than $100 million; cutting 
it and reducing purity can double or triple the value.236 It 
is diffi cult for law enforcement agencies to counteract the 
inducement of drug profi ts. When large-scale drug busts are 
made, supplies become scarce and market values increase, 
encouraging more people to enter the drug trade. There are 
also suspicions that a displacement effect occurs: stepped-up 
efforts to curb drug dealing in one area or city simply en-
courage dealers to seek out friendlier territory.237

attitudes.245 A longitudinal study by psychologist Donald 
Lynam and his colleagues found that D.A.R.E. had no ef-
fect on students’ drug use at any time through 10th grade, 
and a 10-year follow-up failed to find any hidden or de-
layed “sleeper” effects. At age 20, there were no differences 
in drug use between those who received D.A.R.E. and those 
who did not; the only difference was that those who re-
ceived D.A.R.E. reported slightly lower levels of self-esteem 
at age 20, an effect that proponents were not aiming for.246 
These evaluations caused D.A.R.E. to revise its curriculum 
and it is now aimed at older students and relies more on 
having them question their assumptions about drug use 
than on listening to lectures on the subject.
Drug-Testing Strategies Drug testing of students, private 
employees, government workers, and criminal offenders is 
believed to deter substance abuse. In the workplace, em-
ployees are tested to enhance on-the-job safety and produc-
tivity. In some industries, such as mining and transportation, 
drug testing is considered essential because abuse can pose a 
threat to the public.247 Mandatory drug-testing programs in 
government and industry have become routine. The federal 
government requires employee testing in regulated indus-
tries such as nuclear energy and defense contracting. About 
4 million transportation workers are subject to testing.
Drug testing is also part of the federal government’s 
Drug-Free Workplace Program, which has the goal of im-
proving productivity and safety. Employees most likely to 
be tested include presidential appointees, law enforcement 
offi cers, and people in positions of national security.
Criminal defendants are now routinely tested at all 
stages of the justice system, from arrest to parole. The goal is 
to reduce criminal behavior by detecting current users and 
curbing their abuse. Can such programs reduce criminal 
activity? Two evaluations of pretrial drug-testing programs 
found little evidence that monitoring defendants’ drug use 
infl uenced their behavior.248
Schools have adopted drug testing of students, and 
there is some evidence that random tests can reduce drug 
use among youth. Those who favor student testing believe it 
may also help improve the learning environment in schools 
by diminishing the culture of drugs without sacrificing 
school morale.249
Drug Treatment Strategies A number of approaches are 
taken to treat known users, getting them clean of drugs and 
alcohol, and thereby reducing the at-risk population. One 
approach rests on the assumption that each user is an indi-
vidual, and successful treatment must be geared to the using 
patterns and personality of the individual offenders in order 
to build a sense of self.250 Some programs have placed abus-
ers in regimens of outdoor activities and wilderness train-
ing to create self-reliance and a sense of accomplishment.251 
More intensive efforts use group therapy approaches relying 
on group leaders who have been substance abusers; through 
such sessions users get the skills and support to help them 
reject social pressure to use drugs. These programs are based

 Landlords 
have been sued for owning properties that house 
drug dealers; neighborhood groups have scrutinized 
drug houses for building code violations. Information 
 acquired from these various sources is turned over to 
local authorities, such as police and housing agencies, 
for more formal action.
Community-based treatment efforts.
 
■
 Some of these pro-
grams utilize citizen volunteers who participate in 
self-help support programs. Some, such as Narcotics 
Anonymous or Cocaine Anonymous, have more than 
1,000 chapters nationally. Other programs provide 
youths with martial arts training, dancing, and social 
events as an alternative to the drug life.
Enhance the quality of life, improve interpersonal relation-
 
■
ships, and upgrade the neighborhood’s physical environment. 
Activities might include the creation of drug-free school 
zones (which encourage police to keep drug dealers 
away from the vicinity of schools). Consciousness-
raising efforts include demonstrations and marches to 
publicize the drug problem and build solidarity among 
participants. Politicians have been lobbied to get bet-
ter police protection or tougher laws passed; New York 
City residents even sent bags fi lled with crack collected 
from street corners to the mayor and police commis-
sioner to protest drug dealing. Residents have cleaned 
up streets, fi xed broken streetlights, and planted gar-
dens in empty lots to broadcast the message that they 
have local pride and do not want drug dealers in their 
neighborhoods.
These community crime-prevention efforts seem appeal-
ing, but there is little conclusive evidence that they are an 
effective drug-control strategy. Some surveys indicate that 
most residents do not participate in programs. There is also 
evidence that community programs work better in stable, 
middle-income areas than in those that are crime-ridden and 
disorganized.243 Although these fi ndings are discouraging, 
some studies do fi nd that on occasion deteriorated areas can 
sustain successful antidrug programs.244 Future evaluations 
of community control efforts should determine whether they 
can work in the most economically depressed areas.
Education Strategies According to this view, substance 
abuse would decline if kids could be taught about the dan-
gers of drug use. The most widely known drug education 
program, Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.), is 
an elementary school course designed to give students the 
skills for resisting peer pressure to experiment with tobacco, 
drugs, and alcohol. It is unique because it employs uni-
formed police offi cers to carry the antidrug message to the 
students before they enter junior high school. While more 
than 40 percent of all school districts incorporate assistance 
from local law enforcement agencies in their drug preven-
tion programming, reviews of the program have not been 
supportive. Dennis Rosenbaum and his associates found 
that it had only a marginal impact on student drug use and

CHAPTER 14 | Public Order Crime: Sex and Substance Abuse  505
Other therapeutic programs attempt to deal with the 
psychological causes of drug use. Hypnosis, aversion ther-
apy (getting users to associate drugs with unpleasant sensa-
tions, such as nausea), counseling, biofeedback, and other 
techniques are often used.
Some treatment programs are delivered on an outpatient 
basis while others rely on residential care. Which approach 
is better is still being debated. A stay in a residential program 
may stigmatize people as addicts, and while in treatment 
they may be introduced to other users with whom they will 
associate after release. Users do not often enter these pro-
grams voluntarily and have little motivation to change.253
The best treatment for drug use may be a continuum 
of care that includes a customized treatment regimen— 
addressing all aspects of an individual’s life, including medi-
cal and mental health services—and follow–up options 
(e.g., community- or family-based recovery support sys-
tems) that can be crucial to a person’s success in achieving 
and maintaining a drug-free lifestyle.254 Exhibit 14.1 covers 
the most commonly used and relevant treatment strategies. 
However, relatively few drug-dependent people actually 
on the Alcoholics Anonymous approach, which holds that 
users must fi nd within themselves the strength to stay clean 
and that peer support from those who understand their ex-
periences can help them achieve a drug-free life.
Some detoxification efforts use medical procedures to 
wean patients from the more addicting drugs to others, such 
as methadone, that can be more easily regulated. Methadone 
is a drug similar to heroin, and addicts can be treated at clin-
ics where they receive methadone under controlled condi-
tions. However, methadone programs have been undermined 
because some users sell their methadone on the black market, 
and others supplement their dosages with illegally obtained 
heroin. Other programs utilize drugs such as Naxalone, which 
counter the effects of narcotics and ease the trauma of with-
drawal.252 Others, such as Naltrexone, are used in conjunc-
tion with counseling and social support to help people who 
have already terminated their substance abuse avoid drink-
ing or using drugs. Naltrexone works by blocking the effects 
of heroin or other opioids at their receptor sites. Medications 
have also been developed to ease withdrawal symptoms and 
help the transition to a drug-free life.

Effective Treatment Approaches
Medications.
 
■
 Medications can be used to help with different 
aspects of the treatment process.
Withdrawal.
 
■
 Medications offer help in suppressing withdrawal 
symptoms during detoxification. Patients who go through 
medically assisted withdrawal but do not receive any further 
treatment show drug abuse patterns similar to those who 
were never treated.
Treatment.
 
■
 Medications can be used to help reestablish 
normal brain function and to prevent relapse and diminish 
cravings. Medications are now available for treating opioids 
(heroin, morphine), tobacco (nicotine), and alcohol addiction; 
others are being developed for treating stimulant (cocaine, 
methamphetamine) and cannabis (marijuana) addiction. 
A significant problem: many addicts are polydrug users, 
requiring multiple medications.
Behavioral treatments.
 
■
 Behavioral treatments help patients 
engage in the treatment process, modify their attitudes and 
behaviors related to drug abuse, and increase healthy life 
skills. These treatments can also enhance the effectiveness 
of medications and help people stay in treatment longer. 
Outpatient behavioral treatment encompasses a wide 
variety of programs for patients who visit a clinic at regular 
intervals. Most of the programs involve individual or group 
drug counseling. Some programs also offer other forms of 
behavioral treatment:
Cognitive–behavioral therapy 
 
■
seeks to help patients 
recognize, avoid, and cope with the situations in which 
they are most likely to abuse drugs.
Multidimensional family therapy
 
■
 was developed for 
adolescents with drug abuse problems—as well as their 
families—and addresses a range of influences on their 
drug abuse patterns. It is designed to improve overall 
family functioning.
Motivational interviewing
 
■
 capitalizes on the readiness of 
individuals to change their behavior and enter treatment.
Motivational incentives
 
■
 (contingency management) use 
positive reinforcement to encourage abstinence from 
drugs.
Residential treatment
 
■
 programs can also be very effective, 
especially for those with more severe problems.
Therapeutic communities
 
■
 (TCs) are highly structured 
programs in which patients remain at a residence, typically for 
6 to 12 months. TCs differ from other treatment approaches 
principally in their use of the community—treatment staff 
and those in recovery—as a key agent of change to influence 
patient attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors associated with 
drug use. Patients in TCs may include those with relatively 
long histories of drug addiction, involvement in serious 
criminal activities, and seriously impaired social functioning. 
TCs are now also being designed to accommodate the needs 
of women who are pregnant or have children. The focus of 
the TC is on the resocialization of the patient to a drug-free, 
crime-free lifestyle.

complete treatment programs are less likely to use drugs 
than those who drop out.255 Although such data support 
treatment strategies, it is also possible that completers are 
motivated individuals who would have stopped using drugs 
even if they had not been treated.
In order to aid in dispensing treatment, state jurisdic-
tions have developed specialized drug courts. These are de-
scribed in the Policy and Practice in Criminology feature.
Employment Programs Research indicates that drug abus-
ers who obtain and keep employment will end or reduce the 
receive the treatment efforts they so desperately need. Many 
people who need treatment are unaware or in denial. And 
even those who could be helped soon learn that there are 
simply more users who need treatment than there are beds 
in treatment facilities. Many facilities are restricted to users 
whose health insurance will pay for short-term residential 
care; when their insurance coverage ends, patients are often 
released, even though their treatment is incomplete.
Supporters of treatment argue that many addicts are 
helped by intensive inpatient and outpatient treatment. 
As one District of Columbia program shows, clients who 
and her associates conducted in the Bal-
timore City Drug Treatment Court (BCDTC) 
found that drug courts did seem to work for 
reducing crime in a population of offenders 
who were severely drug addicted. In one 
study conducted with Lyn Exum, Gottfred-
son used a carefully designed experimental 
model in which cases were randomly sent 
either to the drug court or a traditional court. 
The researchers found that drug court 
judges actually impose harsher sentences, 
but suspended these sentences conditional 
to compliance with the drug court regimen 
in drug testing and treatment and attending 
status hearings. Most importantly, within a 
12-month period, 48 percent of drug treat-
ment court clients were arrested for new 
offenses, compared to 64 percent of the 
people handled in traditional courts. Among 
the more serious cases heard, 32 percent 
of drug court clients versus 57 percent of 
controls were rearrested. All things consid-
ered, cases handled in a traditional court 
suffered rearrest at a rate nearly three times 
that of drug treatment court.
 Not all drug courts are equal, and national 
evaluations suggest that some are more effec-
tive than others. One reason may be clientele: 
drug courts with the lowest recidivism rates 
(10 percent or less) tend to accept offenders 
with the least severe problems, mostly alcohol 
or marijuana, and who are classified by the 
drug courts as having “minimal” drug prob-
lems. In contrast, the drug courts with the 
highest recidivism rates are willing to  handle 
the more difficult cases involving people ad-
dicted to heroin and/or cocaine.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Are drug courts inherently coercive? 
Should drug users be forced to go into 
treatment?
 2. Are drug treatment programs doomed 
to failure because there are so many 
different types of drug abusers, with 
entirely different motivations?

The mission of drug courts is to stop the 
abuse of alcohol and other drugs and re-
lated criminal activity by offenders. Drug 
courts handle cases involving drug-addicted 
offenders through an extensive supervision 
and treatment program. In exchange for 
successful completion of the program, the 
court may dismiss the original charge, re-
duce or set aside a sentence, offer some 
lesser penalty, or offer a combination of 
these. The aim is to place nonviolent first 
offenders into intensive treatment programs 
rather than in jail or prison. The drug court 
movement began in Florida in order to ad-
dress the state’s growing problem of prison 
overcrowding due in large part to an influx 
of drug-involved offenders. Today there are 
about 2,500 drug courts operating in the 
United States. All 50 states plus the District 
of Columbia, Northern Mariana Islands, 
Puerto Rico, Guam, two Federal Districts, 
and 121 tribal programs have drug courts 
that are in operation or are being planned.
Drug courts address the overlap between 
the public health threats of drug abuse and 
crime: crimes are often drug related; drug 
abusers are frequently involved with the 
criminal justice system. Drug courts provide 
an ideal setting to address these problems 
by linking the justice system with health 
services and drug treatment providers while 
easing the burden on the already overtaxed 
correctional system.

CHAPTER 14 | Public Order Crime: Sex and Substance Abuse  507
Despite the massive effort to control drugs through pre-
vention, deterrence, education, and treatment strategies, the 
fi ght against substance abuse has not proved successful. It is 
diffi cult to get people out of the drug culture because of the 
enormous profi ts involved in the drug trade. It has also proven 
diffi cult to control drugs by convincing known users to quit; 
few treatment efforts have been successful. The problem may 
lie in the fact that there are multiple efforts to control drugs, 
some relying on enforcement and punishment and others on 
treatment and rehabilitation. While the former requires drug 
users to be secretive and discreet in order to avoid detection, 
the latter demands openness and receptivity to treatment.259
Considering this failure, the only course to deal with the 
drug problem is through decriminalization of drug offenses. 
Legalization is warranted, according to drug expert Ethan 
Nadelmann, because the use of mood-altering substances 
is customary in almost all human societies; people have 
always wanted, and will fi nd ways of obtaining, psychoac-
tive drugs.260 Nadelmann heads the Drug Policy Alliance, 
a national organization dedicated to ending the “war against 
drugs” which they believe has become overzealous in its ef-
fort to punish drug traffi ckers.261
Nadelmann reminds us that the federal, state, and local 
governments have spent hundreds of billions of dollars try-
ing to make America drug-free, yet heroin, cocaine, meth-
amphetamine, and other illicit drugs are cheaper, purer, and 
easier to get than ever before. The number of Americans 
behind bars on drug charges is greater than the number of 
Europeans incarcerated for all charges, despite the fact that 
Europe’s population is 500 million larger than ours.
incidence of their substance abuse.256 Not surprisingly, then, 
there have been a number of efforts to provide vocational re-
habilitation for drug abusers. One approach is the supported 
work program, which typically involves job-site training, 
ongoing assessment, and job-site intervention. Rather than 
teach work skills in a classroom, support programs rely on 
helping drug abusers deal with real work settings. Other 
programs that have merit provide training to overcome the 
barriers to employment and improve work skills, including 
help with motivation, education, experience, the job market, 
job-seeking skills, and personal issues.257
Concept Summary 14.1 summarizes the various drug-
control efforts.
Drug Legalization
Given the huge profi ts to be made, can any strategy, whether 
it be treatment or punishment, reduce the lure of drug traf-
ficking? The futility of drug-control is illustrated by the 
fact that despite massive long-term efforts, the price of il-
legal narcotics such as crack cocaine and heroin has drifted 
downward as supplies become more plentiful.
Considering these problems, some commentators have 
called for the legalization or decriminalization of restricted 
drugs. The so-called war on drugs is expensive, costing 
more than $500 billion over the past 20 years—money that 
could have been spent on education and economic devel-
opment. Drug enforcement and treatment now cost federal, 
state, and local governments about $100 billion per year.258

decline because government control would reduce needle 
sharing and the spread of AIDS. Legalization would also de-
stroy the drug-importing cartels and gangs. Because drugs 
would be bought and sold openly, the government would 
reap a tax windfall both from taxes on the sale of drugs and 
from income taxes paid by drug dealers on profi ts that have 
been part of the hidden economy. Of course, drug distribu-
tion would be regulated, like alcohol, keeping drugs away 
from adolescents, public servants such as police and airline 
pilots, and known felons. The Thinking Like a Criminolo-
gist feature addresses the issue of using medical marijuana.
The Consequences of Legalization Critics claim the le-
galization approach might have the short-term effect of re-
ducing the crime rate, but it might also have grave social 
consequences. Legalization would increase the nation’s rate 
of drug usage, creating an even larger group of nonproduc-
tive, drug-dependent people who must be cared for by the 
rest of society.262 If drugs were legalized and freely available, 
drug users might signifi cantly increase their daily intake. 
In countries like Iran and Thailand, where drugs are cheap 
and readily available, the rate of narcotics use is quite high. 
Historically, the availability of cheap narcotics has preceded 
drug-use epidemics, as was the case when British and Amer-
ican merchants sold opium in nineteenth-century China.
Furthermore, if the government tried to raise money by 
taxing legal drugs, as it now does with liquor and cigarettes, 
that might encourage drug smuggling to avoid tax pay-
ments, creating a black market supply chain; these illegal 
drugs might then fall into the hands of adolescents.
There are also health concerns. Because women may 
more easily become dependent on crack than men, the 
Nadelmann also reminds us that the effort to control 
drugs creates more problems than it solves. Public health 
problems like HIV and hepatitis C are all exacerbated by 
draconian laws that keep users in hiding and restrict their 
access to clean needles. And when they get caught and go to 
prison, their families suffer: children of inmates are at risk of 
educational failure, joblessness, addiction, and delinquency. 
People suffering from cancer, AIDS, and other debilitating 
illnesses are regularly denied access to their medicine or 
even arrested and prosecuted for using medical marijuana.
Banning drugs creates networks of manufacturers and 
distributors, many of whom use violence as part of their 
standard operating procedures. Although some believe that 
drug use is immoral, Nadelmann questions whether it is any 
worse than the unrestricted use of alcohol and cigarettes, 
both of which are addicting and unhealthful. Far more 
people die each year because they abuse these legal sub-
stances than are killed in drug wars or from abusing illegal 
substances.
Nadelmann also states that just as Prohibition failed to 
stop the fl ow of alcohol in the 1920s, while it increased the 
power of organized crime, the policy of prohibiting drugs 
is similarly doomed to failure. When drugs were legal and 
freely available in the early twentieth century, the propor-
tion of Americans using drugs was not much greater than 
today. Most users led normal lives, probably because of the 
legal status of their drug use.
If drugs were legalized, the argument goes, price and 
distribution could be controlled by the government. This 
would reduce addicts’ cash requirements, so crime rates 
would drop because users would no longer need the same 
cash fl ow to support their habits. Drug-related deaths would 
The national drug czar asks you to review this 
policy statement by the Drug Policy Alliance, on 
the potential legalization of marijuana:
Since the 1970s pressure has been build-
ing to move away from the total prohibi-
tion of cannabis. Over the past century, 
numerous reports from independent, 
government-sponsored commissions have 
documented the drug’s relative harm-
lessness and recommended the elimination of criminal 
sanctions for consumption-related offenses. Opinion 
polls show growing support for cannabis  reform, and sci-
entific, medical, and patient communities consistently 
provide evidence of the drug’s therapeutic  potential. As 
the public increasingly demands legal access to can-
nabis for both medicinal and other responsible uses, 
 
 policy makers are being forced to con-
sider how to regulate the drug.
❯❯ As the coordinator of the nation’s efforts 
to control drugs, the czar who heads the Of-
fice of Drug Control Policy wants your opinion 
on continuing the ban on marijuana posses-
sion and use. Is it ethical, he wants to know, 
to prohibit a drug that has medicinal applica-
tions and can relieve suffering? Or is marijuana 
too dangerous to legalize for any reason? Divide the class into 
two groups, one taking the legalization of medical marijuana po-
sition and the other supporting the continued ban on marijuana 
even for medical purposes. Have an in-class debate with mem-
bers of each side presenting arguments for and against medical 
marijuana.

 1. Be familiar with the association 
between law and morality
Public order crimes are acts 
 
■
considered illegal because they 
confl ict with social policy, ac-
cepted moral rules, and pub-
lic opinion. There is usually 
great debate over public order 
crimes. Some charge that they 
are not really crimes at all and 
that it is foolish to legislate mo-
rality. Others view such mor-
ally tinged acts as prostitution, 
gambling, and drug abuse as 
harmful and therefore subject 
to public control.
 2. Be familiar with the term 
social harm
According to the theory of so-
 
■
cial harm, acts become crimes 
when they cause injury and 
produce harm to others. How-
ever, some dangerous activi-
ties are not considered crimes, 
and others that do not appear 
 harmful are criminalized.
 3. Discuss the activities of moral 
crusaders
Moral crusaders seek to shape 
 
■
the law toward their own 
way of thinking. These moral 
entrepreneurs go on moral 
crusades to take on such is-
sues as prayer in school, gun 
ownership, abortion, and the 
distribution of sexually explicit 
books. One group of crusaders 
is determined to prevent the le-
galization of gay marriage; their 
objective is passage of a consti-
tutional amendment declaring 
that marriage is between one 
man and one woman. Oppos-
ing them are groups of activists 
who have tirelessly campaigned 
for the civil rights of gay men 
and women.
 4. Know the various forms of 
outlawed deviant sexuality
Outlawed sexual behavior, 
 
■
known as paraphilias, includes 
such acts as frotteurism (rub-
bing against or touching a 
nonconsenting person in a 
crowd, elevator, or other public 
area), voyeurism (obtaining 
sexual pleasure from spying 
on a stranger while he or she 
disrobes or engages in sexual 
behavior with another), exhibi-
tionism (deriving sexual plea-
sure from exposing the genitals 
to surprise or shock a stranger), 
sadomasochism (deriving plea-
sure from receiving pain or 
infl icting pain on another), and 
pedophilia (attaining sexual 
pleasure through sexual activity 
with prepubescent children).
 5. Discuss the history of prostitu-
tion and what the term means 
today
Prostitution has been known for 
 
■
thousands of years. The earli-
est record of prostitution ap-
pears in ancient Mesopotamia, 
where priests engaged in sex 
to promote fertility in the com-
munity. Modern commercial 
sex appears to have its roots in 
ancient Greece. Today, prostitu-
tion can be defi ned as grant-
ing nonmarital sexual access, 
established by mutual agree-
ment of the prostitutes, their 
clients, and their employers, 
for remuneration.
 6. Distinguish between the differ-
ent types of prostitutes
Prostitutes who work the 
 
■
streets in plain sight of police, 
citizens, and customers are 
 referred to as hustlers, hook-
ers, or streetwalkers. B-girls 
spend their time in bars, drink-
ing and waiting to be picked 
up by customers. Brothel 
prostitutes live in a house with 
a madam who employs them, 
supervises their behavior, and 
receives a fee for her services. 
Call girls work via telephone 
“dates,” get their clients by 
word of mouth or by making 
arrangements with bellhops, 
cab drivers, and so on. Some 
escort services are fronts for 
prostitution rings. Prostitutes 
provide alternatives to drugs that will reduce teenage drug 
dependency?264 The answers to these questions have proven 
elusive.
•  Cocaine Anonymous is a fellowship of men and 
women who share their experience, strength, and 
  hope with one another so that they may solve their 
common problem and help others to recover from their 
addiction.
•  Narcotics Anonymous is a similar organization based 
on the principles of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
For more information about these organizations, visit the 
Criminal Justice CourseMate at cengagebrain.com, then 
access the “Web Links” for this chapter.
number of drug-dependent babies could begin to match or 
exceed the number delivered with fetal alcohol syndrome.263 
Drunk-driving fatalities, which today number about 12,000 
per year, might be matched by deaths due to driving un-
der the infl uence of pot or crack. And although distribution 
would be regulated, it is likely that adolescents would have 
the same opportunity to obtain potent drugs as they now 
have to obtain alcoholic beverages.
Decriminalization or legalization of controlled sub-
stances is unlikely in the near term, but further study is 
warranted. What effect would a policy of partial decriminal-
ization (for example, legalizing small amounts of marijuana) 
have on drug use rates? Would a get-tough policy help to 
“widen the net” of the justice system and actually deepen 
some youths’ involvement in substance abuse? Can society

use by educating potential us-
ers to the dangers of substance 
abuse (convincing them to “say 
no to drugs”) and by organizing 
community groups to work with 
the at-risk population in their 
area. Still another approach is to 
treat known users so they can 
control their addictions.
 10. State the arguments for and 
against legalizing drugs
Drugs should be legalized be-
 
■
cause the money spent on con-
trol could be used on education 
and economic development. 
People have always wanted, and 
will fi nd ways of obtaining, psy-
choactive drugs. The drug war 
causes many health problems, 
such as HIV and hepatitis C, 
because if users are in hiding 
their access to clean needles is 
restricted. Children of addicts 
are at risk of educational failure, 
joblessness, addiction, and de-
linquency. People suffering from 
cancer, AIDS, and other debili-
tating illnesses are arrested and 
prosecuted for using medical 
marijuana. Banning drugs cre-
ates networks of manufactur-
ers and distributors, many of 
whom use violence as part of 
their standard operating proce-
dures. If drugs were legalized, 
price and distribution could be 
controlled by the government.
 8. Be able to discuss the cause of 
substance abuse
The onset of drug use can be 
 
■
tied to such factors as racial 
prejudice, devalued identities, 
low self-esteem, poor socioeco-
nomic status, and the high level 
of mistrust, negativism, and 
defi ance found in impoverished 
areas. Some experts have linked 
substance abuse to psychological 
defi cits such as impaired cogni-
tive functioning, personality 
disturbance, and emotional 
problems. Substance abuse 
may have a genetic basis. Social 
psychologists suggest that drug 
abuse may also result from ob-
serving parental drug use. Sub-
stance abuse may be just one of 
many social problem behaviors. 
Some may use drugs and alcohol 
because they want to enjoy their 
effects: get high, relax, improve 
creativity, escape reality, and in-
crease sexual responsiveness.
 9. Compare and contrast the dif-
ferent methods of drug control
A number of different drug-con-
 
■
trol strategies have been tried, 
with varying degrees of success. 
Some aim to deter drug use by 
stopping the fl ow of drugs into 
the country, apprehending and 
punishing dealers, and cracking 
down on street-level drug deals. 
Others focus on preventing drug 
known as circuit travelers 
move around in groups of two 
or three to lumber, labor, and 
agricultural camps. Prostitutes 
set up personal websites or 
put listings on web boards that 
carry personals.
 7. Be able to discuss what is 
meant by obscenity and 
pornography
Pornography involves the pro-
 
■
duction, distribution, and sale 
of sexually explicit material 
intended to sexually excite pay-
ing customers. The depiction 
of sex and nudity is not ille-
gal, but it does violate the law 
when it is judged obscene. Ob-
scenity is a legal term that today 
is defi ned as material offensive 
to community standards. Le-
gally, something is considered 
obscene if the average person 
applying contemporary com-
munity standards would fi nd 
that the work taken as a whole 
appeals to the prurient inter-
est; that the work depicts or 
describes prohibited sexual 
conduct; and that the work, 
taken as a whole, lacks seri-
ous literary, artistic, political, 
or scientifi c value. A growing 
problem is the exploitation of 
children in obscene materials 
(kiddie porn), which has been 
expanded through the Internet.

make men become sexually 
aggressive.
 7. Are there objective standards of 
morality? Does the existing crimi-
nal code refl ect contemporary na-
tional moral standards? Or are 
laws banning sexual behaviors 
and substance abuse the product 
of a relatively few “moral entre-
preneurs” who seek to control 
other people’s behaviors?
sexually explicit photos of chil-
dren if they were artifi cial im-
ages created by computer 
animation?
 6. Which statement is more 
 accurate? (a) Sexually aggressive 
men are drawn to pornography 
 because it reinforces their 
 preexisting hostile orientation 
to sexuality. (b) Reading or 
 watching pornography can 
images on TV of drugs and alco-
hol be banned?
 4. Is prostitution really a crime? 
Should a man or woman have the 
right to sell sexual favors if he or 
she so chooses?
 5. Do you believe there should be 
greater controls placed on the 
distribution of sexually explicit 
material on the Internet? Would 
you approve of the online sale of

In 2010, Americans became very familiar with a previously unknown website called WikiLeaks, an 
international organization that publishes classifi ed and secret documents that are submitted by unnamed and 
anonymous sources. Launched in 2006 and run by Julian Assange, an Australian who emigrated to Sweden, 
WikiLeaks has supporters around the globe. In April 2010, the site began to post videos and documents 
that had been illegally appropriated from U.S. diplomatic and military computers by unknown hackers. For 
example, one video showed a 2007 incident in which Iraqi civilians and journalists were killed by U.S. forces. 
It also leaked more than 76,000 classifi ed war documents from Afghanistan. In November 2010, WikiLeaks 
released U.S. State Department cables. In the aftermath of the leaks, Army Specialist Bradley Manning, 22,

industries shift their manufacturing plants to areas of the 
world where production is much cheaper. IT is responsible 
for the globalization phenomenon, the process of creating 
transnational markets, politics, and legal systems—in other 
words, creating a global economy. The Internet coupled with 
ever more powerful computers is now the chosen medium 
to provide a wide range of global services, ranging from en-
tertainment and communication to research and education.
The cyberage has also generated an enormous amount 
of revenue. Total spending on IT and telecommunications is 
forecasted to grow by more than 6 percent each year. World-
wide business enterprise IT spending will reach $2.5 tril-
lion in 2011, a 3.1 percent increase from 2010 spending of 
$2.4 trillion, according to Gartner, Inc., a fi rm that tracks 
technology.2 Magnifying the importance of the Internet is 
the fact that many critical infrastructure functions are now 
being conducted online, ranging from banking to control of 
shipping on the Mississippi River.
This vast network has become a target for illegal ac-
tivities and enterprise. Some cybercriminals use modern 
technology to sell illegal goods and services, or conversely, 
to illegally appropriate legitimate products and services. 
Cybertheft schemes range from illegal copying of copy-
righted material to using technology to commit traditional 
theft-based offenses such as larceny and fraud.
Another type of cybercriminal is motivated less by profi t 
and more by the urge to commit cybervandalism or tech-
nological destruction. They aim their malicious attacks at 
disrupting, defacing, and destroying technology that they 
fi nd offensive.
A third type of cybercrime, cyberwar, is political, involv-
ing spying, espionage, and can even involve cyberterrorism,
acts aimed at undermining the social, economic, and politi-
cal system of an enemy nation by destroying its electronic 
infrastructure and disrupting its economy.
In sum, some cybercriminals are high-tech thieves while 
others are high-tech vandals; the property they destroy is 
electronic rather then physical. And some may create trans-
national networks that integrate IT into their plans in order 
to carry out criminal schemes while confounding law en-
forcement agents who seek to disrupt their criminal efforts 
(see Concept Summary 15.1).
This new array of crimes presents a compelling chal-
lenge for the justice system and law enforcement community 
was arrested after an informant told federal authorities that he had overheard him bragging about giving 
WikiLeaks a video of a helicopter assault in Iraq plus more than 260,000 classifi ed U.S. diplomatic cables 
taken from government computers. Assange has been accused of sexual misconduct in Sweden, but at the 
time of this writing, no charges have been fi led against him for the WikiLeaks disclosures. Both the U.S. and 
foreign governments were embarrassed when the confi dential cables hit the Net.1
J
Just a few years ago, complex, global incidents involving 
leaking classifi ed documents could not have been contem-
plated, let alone transacted. Innovation brings change and 
with it new opportunities to commit crime. The techno-
logical revolution has provided new tools to misappropri-
ate funds, damage property, sell illicit material, or conduct 
warfare, espionage, and terror. It has created cybercrime, a 
new breed of offenses that can be singular or ongoing, but 
typically involve the theft and/or destruction of informa-
tion, resources, or funds utilizing computers, computer net-
works, and the Internet. The Internet age has also provided 
new tools and opportunities for organized criminals, who 
have morphed from local gangs into transnational criminal 
organizations whose illegal activities span not only national 
borders but continents. Drug gangs may move their product 
from one nation to another, while human traffi ckers may ply 
their trade across continents. It also raises questions about 
what is a cybercrime. Is leaking classifi ed government docu-
ments as Assange did a violation of legal rules or are his ac-
tions protected by the First Amendment? If so, should there 
be new regulations controlling the content of the Internet 
and regulating its usage?
Chapter 13 reviewed the concept of enterprise crime 
and its motivations, and Chapter 14 covered public 
order crimes. Cybercrime can be viewed as a type of 
enterprise crime employing sophisticated technology to 
achieve illegal profi ts. It can also involve public order 
crimes such as the online purchase and sale of pornog-
raphy and controlled substances. The Internet now en-
ables these previously localized crimes to be conducted 
on a global scale.
CONNECTIONS
Criminals are becoming more technologically sophisti-
cated, routinely using the Internet to carry out their crimi-
nal conspiracies. The widespread use of computers and the 
Internet has ushered in the age of information technology 
(IT) and made it an intricate part of daily life in most in-
dustrialized societies. IT involves computer networking, the 
Internet, and advanced communications. It is the key to the 
economic system and will become more important as major

because (a) it is rapidly evolving with new schemes being 
created daily, (b) it is diffi cult to detect through traditional 
law enforcement channels, and (c) its control demands that 
agents of the justice system develop technical skills that 
match those of the perpetrators.3 It may even be possible 
that the recent crime drop is a result of cybercrime replacing 
traditional street crime. Instead of robbing a bank at gun-
point, a new group of contemporary thieves fi nds it easier to 
hack into accounts and transfer funds to offshore banks. In-
stead of shoplifting from a brick and mortar store, the con-
temporary cyberthief devises clever schemes to steal from 
etailers. And instead of limiting their criminal escapades to 
the local population, transnational gang members now fi nd 
a whole world of opportunity.
Cyber and transnational crimes also present a signifi cant 
challenge for criminologists because they defy long-held as-
sumptions about the cause of crime. How can we say that 
crime is a function of social forces, the social environment, 
or the social structure, when these contemporary criminals 
are typically highly educated and technologically sophisti-
cated people who commit their crimes in places far removed 
from their victims? These criminal conspiracies demand 
a high degree of self-control and dedication, something a 
truly impulsive or mentally unstable person would have dif-
fi culty achieving. As cybercrime expert Majid Yar explains, 
it may be that “considerable theoretical innovation” will be

financial institutions, where the customers 
were asked to enter their account numbers, 
passwords, and other information. Because 
the websites appeared to be legitimate—
complete with bank logos and legal dis-
claimers—the customers did not realize that 
the websites did not belong to legitimate fi-
nancial institutions.
Armed with the bank account informa-
tion, members of the conspiracy hacked 
into accounts at two banks. Once they ac-
cessed the accounts, the Egyptians com-
municated via text messages, telephone 
calls, and Internet chat groups with co-
conspirators in the United States. Through 
these communications, members of the 
criminal ring coordinated the illicit on-
line transfer of funds from compromised 
 accounts to newly created fraudulent 
 accounts. In the United States, conspira-
tors directed associates to recruit “run-
ners” who set up bank accounts where 
the funds stolen from the compromised 
accounts could be transferred and with-
drawn. A portion of the illegally obtained 
funds were then transferred via wire ser-
vices to individuals operating in Egypt who 
had originally provided the bank account 
information obtained via phishing.
After the case was blown open by 
American and Egyptian law enforcement 
agents, the conspirators were charged with

Operation Phish Phry
The FBI called it Operation Phish Phry, a 
play on words for the popular cybercrime 
of phishing, fraudulently collecting personal 
information from victims that can be used 
to defraud financial institutions by creating 
dummy accounts or bogus credit cards. 
However, this Phish Phry was not a “mom 
and pop” scam, but an international con-
spiracy involving more than 50 people in 
the United States and Egypt. An elaborate 
global conspiracy designed to steal identi-
ties by targeting American-based financial 
institutions, Phish Phry victimized account 
holders by fraudulently using their personal 
financial information. Egyptian-based hack-
ers obtained bank account numbers and 
related personal identification information 
from bank customers by sending e-mail 
messages that appeared to be official cor-
respondence from banks or credit card 
vendors. The bank customers were directed 
to fake websites purporting to be linked to

conceal the fraud, she then altered the electronic check reg-
ister to make it appear that the checks had been payable to 
North Bay’s vendors. Jessica cashed several of the checks, 
and many were deposited into her bank account and the 
bank accounts of others and used for personal expenses.6
Jessica’s crime falls under the general category of com-
puter fraud, not a unique offense, but rather a common-law 
crime committed using contemporary technology. Conse-
quently, many computer crimes are prosecuted under such 
traditional criminal statutes as larceny or fraud. However, 
not all computer crimes fall under common-law statutes, 
because the property stolen may be intangible (electronic 
and/or magnetic impulse). Some of these crimes are listed 
in Exhibit 15.1. These are but a few of the most common 
examples, and the list is as long as the imagination of the 
criminal mind.
There are a number of recent trends in computer frauds. 
Internal attacks are now outgrowing external attacks at the 
world’s largest fi nancial institutions. According to a global 
security survey, about 60 percent of U.S. companies report 
being hit by viruses in the past year; computer network 
attacks were experienced by 10 percent of international 
companies.7
Theft from ATMs Automatic teller machines (ATMs) 
 attract the attention of cybercriminals looking for easy prof-
its.8 Rather than robbing an ATM user at gunpoint, the cyber-
criminal relies on stealth and technological skill to commit 
the crime. One approach is to use a thin, transparent-plastic 
required before criminologists can fully understand this 
phenomenon.4 The Profi les in Crime feature on the previ-
ous page shows the connection between cybercrime and 
transnational crime in the Internet age.
Considering their importance both theoretically and 
practically, this chapter reviews the various forms of cyber-
crime and transnational crime.
CYBERTHEFT: CYBERCRIMES 
FOR PROFIT
It is ironic that technological breakthroughs since the dawn 
of the Industrial Revolution—such as telephones and auto-
mobiles—not only brought with them dramatic improve-
ments for society but also created new opportunities for 
criminal wrongdoing: criminals use the telephone to place 
bets or threaten victims; cars can be stolen and sold for big 
profi ts.5 The same pattern is now occurring during the IT 
revolution. The computer and Internet provide opportuni-
ties for socially benefi cial endeavors—such as education, 
research, commerce, and entertainment—while at the same 
time serving as a tool to facilitate illegal activity. The new 
computer-based technology allows criminals to operate in 
a more efficient and effective manner. Cyberthieves now 
have the luxury of remaining anonymous, living in any part 
of the world, conducting their business during the day or 
in the evening, working alone or in a group, while at the 
same time reaching a much wider number of potential vic-
tims than ever before. No longer is the con artist or crimi-
nal entrepreneur limited to fl eecing victims in a particular 
geographic locale; the whole world can be his or her target. 
The technology revolution has opened novel methods for 
cybertheft that heretofore were nonexistent, ranging from 
the unlawful distribution of computer software to Internet 
security fraud.
Cyberthieves conspire to use cyberspace to either dis-
tribute illegal goods and services or to defraud people for 
quick profi ts. Some of the most common methods are dis-
cussed here.
Computer Fraud
Jessica Sabathia, a 31-year-old California woman, pleaded 
guilty to computer fraud in 2007 as a result of her scheme 
to embezzle more than $875,000 from North Bay Health 
Care Group. Sabathia, an accounts payable clerk for North 
Bay, used her computer to access North Bay’s accounting 
software without the authority of her employer and issued 
approximately 127 checks payable to herself and others. To

Examples of Computer Fraud
Theft of information. 
 
■
The unauthorized obtaining of 
information from a computer (hacking), including 
software that is copied for profit.
The “salami” fraud. 
 
■
With this type of fraud, the perpetra-
tor carefully skims small sums from the balances of a 
large number of accounts in order to bypass internal 
controls and escape detection.
Software theft. 
 
■
The comparative ease of making copies 
of computer software has led to a huge illegal market, 
depriving authors of very significant revenues.
Manipulation of accounts/banking systems. 
 
■
Similar to a 
“salami” fraud, but on a much larger and usually more 
complex scale. Sometimes perpetrated as a “one-off 
 kamikaze” fraud. 
Corporate espionage. 
 
■
Trade secrets are stolen by a com-
pany’s competitors, which can be either domestic or 
foreign. The goal is to increase the rival company’s (or 
nation’s) competitive edge in the global marketplace.

(“Yo” stands for “years old.”)
The 12 men were charged with engaging in a child ex-
ploitation enterprise; illegally posting notices seeking to re-
ceive, exchange, and distribute child porn across state lines; 
and obstruction of justice. Several also were charged with 
producing the pornography—meaning they had contact 
with the children who were exploited.9
The IT revolution has revitalized the porn industry. The 
Internet is an ideal venue for selling and distributing ob-
scene material; the computer is an ideal device for storage 
and viewing. It is diffi cult to estimate the vast number of 
websites featuring sexual content, including nude photos, 
videos, live sex acts, and webcam strip sessions among other 
forms of “adult entertainment.”10 There are some indicators 
that show the extent of the industry:
Almost 90 percent of porn is created in the United States.
 
■
About $3 billion in revenue is generated from U.S. porn 
 
■
sites each year, compared to $9 billion for all movie box 
offi ce sales!
$89 is spent on porn every second.
 
■
260 new porn sites go online daily.
 
■
11
The number of visits to pornographic sites (mostly by 
men, though women make up about 30 percent of the view-
ers) surpasses those made to Internet search engines; some 
individual sites report as many as 50 million hits per year.
How do adult sites operate today? There are a number of 
different schemes in operation:12
A large fi rm sells annual subscriptions in exchange for 
 
■
unlimited access to content.
Password services charge an annual fee to deliver access 
 
■
to hundreds of small sites, which share the subscription 
revenues.
Large fi rms provide free content to smaller affi liate sites. 
 
■
The affi liates post the free content and then try to chan-
nel visitors to the large sites, which give the smaller 
sites a percentage of the fees paid by those who sign up.
Webmasters forward traffi c to another porn site in re-
 
■
turn for a small per-consumer fee. In many cases, the 
consumer is sent to the other sites involuntarily, which 
is known in the industry as mousetrapping. Web surfers 
who try to close out a window after visiting an adult 
site are sent to another web page automatically. This 
can repeat dozens of times, causing users to panic and 
restart their computers in order to escape.
Adult sites cater to niche audiences looking for specifi c 
 
■
kinds of adult content. While some sites cater to legal 
sexually related material, others cross the legal border by 
peddling access to obscene material or even kiddie porn.
Despite some successful prosecutions, it has been diffi cult 
to control Internet pornography. Various federal legislative 
efforts, including the Communications Decency Act (1996), 
the Child Online Protection Act (1998), and the Children’s 
Internet Protection Act (2000), have been successfully 
overlay on an ATM keypad that captures a user’s identifi ca-
tion code as it is entered. Though the plastic covering looks 
like some sort of cover to protect the keys, in fact, micro-
chips in the device record every keystroke. Another trans-
parent device inside the card slot captures card data. While 
the client completes the transaction, a computer attached 
to the overlay records all the data necessary to clone the 
card. In one recent South Florida case (2009), three people 
made these “skimming devices,” which captured the infor-
mation stored on the magnetic stripe of bank debit cards 
when the debit cards were placed into ATMs throughout 
Broward, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade Counties. The skim-
ming devices and hidden micro-video cameras were placed 
on the ATMs to record customers’ personal identifi cation 
numbers (PINs) as they conducted their transactions. The 
co-conspirators subsequently removed the skimming de-
vices and cameras from the ATMs and downloaded the sto-
len information. They then created false bank debit cards by 
encoding the magnetic stripes of gift cards and other plastic 
cards with magnetic stripes containing the stolen banking 
information. Using these false cards and the victims’ PINs, 
the thieves withdrew funds from ATMs. They sent some of 
the funds fraudulently obtained to individuals in the United 
States, Romania, and elsewhere, using Western Union and 
other money-transmitting services. 
Distributing Illicit or Illegal Services 
and Material
The Internet has become a prime source for the delivery of 
illicit or legally prohibited material. Included within this 
market are distribution of pornography and obscene mate-
rial, including kiddie porn, and the distribution of danger-
ous drugs.
Distributing Obscenity In March 2008, 22 people, includ-
ing 12 Americans, were charged with participating in an in-
ternational child pornography ring. Investigators confi scated 
more than 400,000 pictures, video fi les, and other images 
showing children engaged in sexual behavior. Some of the 
child victims were as young as 5 years old; many displayed 
innocent characteristics such as wearing their hair in pigtails. 
The ring was begun in Australia and recruited pornographers 
all over the world, including England, Canada, and Germany.
 Though the ring was fi rst discovered and infi ltrated in 
2006, it took more than two years to get indictments be-
cause of its technical sophistication, which included the 
use of encryption, background checks, and other security 
measures. One of the men indicted, 54-year-old Raymond 
Roy of San Juan Capistrano, California, posted videos of 
Thai children “to give everyone something to do for an af-
ternoon.” Another posting made on July 10, 2007, stated, 
“This one may offend here, so a word of caution, these girls 
are heavily drugged. Not much action to speak of, the girls 
are (sic) to (expletive deleted) up to move, or resist. Three

attacks and crashed the websites of a number of businesses, 
including credit card fi rm MasterCard, because it blocked 
donations to WikiLeaks.16 The web activists (calling them-
selves Anonymous) threatened to launch similar attacks 
against any business that had blocked WikiLeaks. 
The methods used by the Anonymous group are col-
lectively known as a denial-of-service attack, typically de-
signed to harass or extort money from legitimate users of an 
Internet service by threatening to prevent the user having 
access to the service.17 While the WikiLeaks attacks were 
aimed at vengeance, typically denial-of-service involves cy-
berextortion. Examples include:
Attempts to fl ood a computer network, thereby pre-

Established in 1988, the CERT® Coordination Center 
(CERT/CC) is a center of Internet security expertise, 
located at the Software Engineering Institute, a federally 
funded research and development center operated 
by Carnegie Mellon University. To learn more, visit the 
Criminal Justice CourseMate at cengagebrain.com, then 
access the “Web Links” for this chapter.
A denial-of-service attack may involve threatening or 
actually flooding an Internet site with millions of bogus 
messages or orders so that the services will be tied up and 
unable to perform as promised. Unless the site operator pays 
extortion, the attackers threaten to keep up the interference 
until real consumers become frustrated and abandon the 
site. Even so-called respectable businesspeople have been 
accused of launching denial-of-service attacks against rival 
business interests.18
Online gambling casinos—a $7 billion a year industry—
have proven particularly vulnerable to attack. Hundreds of 
attacks have been launched against online casinos located 
in Costa Rica, the Caribbean, and Great Britain. If the attack 
coincides with a big sporting event such as the Super Bowl, 
the casinos may give in and make payments rather than lose 
revenue and fray customer relations.19
Illegal Copyright Infringement
Groups of individuals have been working together to ille-
gally obtain software and then “crack” or “rip” its copyright 
protections, before posting it on the Internet for other mem-
bers of the group to use; this is called warez.
Frequently, these new pirated copies reach the Internet 
days or weeks before the legitimate product is commercially 
challenged in the courts under the First Amendment. Filter-
ing devices used extensively in schools and libraries fail to 
block out a lot of obscene material, giving youngsters the op-
portunity to use computers away from home to surf the Net 
for adult content. It is unlikely that any law enforcement ef-
forts will put a dent in the Internet porn industry.
Pornography was discussed more fully in Chapter 14. 
The ability to access pornographic material over the 
Internet has helped expand the sale of sexually re-
lated material. People wishing to purchase sexually re-
lated material no long face the risk of public exposure 
in adult bookstores or movie theaters. Sellers of adult 
fi lms and photos can now reach a much wider interna-
tional audience.
CONNECTIONS
Distributing Dangerous Drugs In addition to sexual ma-
terial, the Internet has become a prime purveyor of prescrip-
tion drugs, some of which can be quite dangerous when 
they are used to excess or fall into the hands of minors. One 
national survey found that in a single year (2006–2007) the 
number of websites that advertise or sell controlled prescrip-
tion drugs increased 70 percent. There was a 135 percent 
increase in websites advertising these drugs and a 7 percent 
increase in sites offering to sell them over the Net.13
While the sites selling prescription drugs are booming, 
relatively few require that the patient provide a prescription 
from his or her doctor, and of those that do, about half only 
require that an original prescription be provided. This al-
lows prescriptions to be faxed, giving buyers the opportu-
nity for multiple purchases with a single scrip. Of those sites 
not requiring prescriptions:
33 percent clearly stated that no prescription was 
 
■
needed.
53 percent offered an “online consultation” that allowed 
 
■
users to get a prescription and make a purchase.
14 percent made no mention of a prescription.
 
■
14
Children are especially at risk, and more than 2 million 
kids are feared to be abusing an illegally obtained prescription 
drug. More teens have abused these drugs than many other 
illegal drugs, including Ecstasy, cocaine, crack, and metham-
phetamine. With access to a credit card, they can order opi-
oid-based drugs (e.g., codeine, Demerol, OxyContin, Percocet, 
and Darvon), depressants (e.g., Xanax, Librium, and Valium), 
and stimulants (e.g., Adderall, Dexedrine, and Ritalin).15
Denial-of-Service Attack
In the aftermath of the WikiLeaks scandal, a number of ser-
vice providers cut off the website and refused them services. 
In retaliation, hackers who support WikiLeaks launched

agreed to fi ndings of fraud but later questioned whether he 
had done anything wrong; he was forced to hand over his il-
licit gains, plus interest, which came to $285,000.24
Though he might not agree, young Lebed’s actions are 
considered Internet fraud because they involve using the In-
ternet to intentionally manipulate the securities marketplace 
for profi t. There are three major types of Internet securities 
fraud today:
Market manipulation.
 
■
 Stock market manipulation occurs 
when an individual tries to control the price of stock 
by interfering with the natural forces of supply and de-
mand. There are two principal forms of this crime: the 
“pump and dump” and the “cybersmear.” In a pump 
and dump scheme, erroneous and deceptive informa-
tion is posted online to get unsuspecting investors inter-
ested in a stock while those spreading the information 
sell previously purchased stock at an infl ated price. The 
cybersmear is a reverse pump and dump: negative in-
formation is spread online about a stock, driving down 
its price and enabling people to buy it at an artifi cially 
low price before rebuttals by the company’s offi cers re-
infl ate the price.25
Fraudulent offerings of securities.
 
■
 Some cybercriminals 
create websites specifi cally designed to fraudulently sell 
securities. To make the offerings look more attractive 
than they are, assets may be infl ated, expected returns 
overstated, and risks understated. In these schemes, 
investors are promised abnormally high profi ts on their 
investments. No investment is actually made. Early 
investors are paid returns with the investment money 
received from the later investors. The system usually 
collapses, and the later investors do not receive divi-
dends and lose their initial investment. For example, 
the Tri-West Investment Company solicited investments 
in “prime bank notes.”26 Visitors to their website were 
promised an annualized rate of return of 120 percent 
plus return of their principal at the end of a year, as 
well as substantial referral fees of 15 percent on all 
referred investments. The website, which contained 
alleged testimonials describing instant wealth from 
early investors, also told visitors that their investments 
were “guaranteed.” Investors contributed $60 million 
in funds to Tri-West, and some “dividends” were paid. 
However, no money was actually invested, the divi-
dends were paid from new investments, and most of the 
cash was siphoned off by the schemers.
Illegal touting.
 
■
 This crime occurs when individuals make 
securities recommendations and fail to disclose that they 
are being paid to disseminate their favorable opinions. 
Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 requires that 
paid touters disclose the nature, source, and amount of 
their compensation. If those who tout stocks fail to dis-
close their relationship with the company, information 
misleads investors into believing that the speaker is ob-
jective and credible rather than bought and paid for.
available. The government has actively pursued members of 
the warez community, and some have been charged and con-
victed under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 
which criminalizes accessing computer systems without 
authorization to obtain information,20 and the Digital Mil-
lennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which makes it a crime 
to circumvent antipiracy measures built into most com-
mercial software and also outlaws the manufacture, sale, or 
distribution of code-cracking devices used to illegally copy 
software.21
File Sharing Another form of illegal copyright infringe-
ment involves file-sharing programs that allow Internet 
users to download music and other copyrighted material 
without paying the artists and record producers their right-
ful royalties. Theft through the illegal reproduction and 
distribution of movies, software, games, and music is esti-
mated to cost U.S. industries around $20 billion worldwide 
each year.
Although some students routinely share fi les and down-
load music, criminal copyright infringement represents a 
serious economic threat. The United States Criminal Code 
provides penalties for a fi rst-time offender of fi ve years in-
carceration and a fi ne of $250,000.22 Other provisions pro-
vide for the forfeiture and destruction of infringing copies 
and all equipment used to make the copies.23
On June 27, 2005, copyright protection of music and 
other types of entertainment distributed via the Internet was 
upheld by the Supreme Court in the case of MGM Studios, 
Inc. v. Grokster, 125 S. Ct. 2764 (2005). The Court unani-
mously held that software distributors such as Grokster 
could be sued for inducing copyright infringement if they 
market fi le-sharing software that might induce people to il-
legally copy protected material even if that software could 
also be used for legitimate purposes. Justice Souter wrote:
We hold that one who distributes a device with the 
object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as 
shown by the clear expression or other affi rmative 
steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the re-
sulting acts of infringement by third parties.
As a result of the opinion, on November 7, 2005, 
Grokster announced that it would suspend its fi le-sharing 
service; it was also forced to pay $50 million to the music 
and recording industries.
Internet Securities Fraud
Fifteen-year-old Jonathan Lebed was charged with securities 
fraud by the SEC after he repeatedly bought low-cost, thinly 
traded stocks and then spread hundreds of false and mis-
leading messages concerning them—generally baseless price 
predictions. After their values were artifi cially infl ated, Lebed 
sold the securities at an infl ated price. His smallest one-day 
gain was $12,000, and one day he made $74,000. Lebed

website, they are asked to provide personal information 
or financial account information so the problem can be 
fi xed. Some phishing schemes involve job offers. Once the 
unsuspecting victims fill out the “application,” answer-
ing personal questions and including their Social Security 
number, the phisher has them in his or her grasp. One in-
genious scam is referred to as reshipping and is discussed 
in Exhibit 15. 2.
Once phishers have a victim’s personal information, 
they can do three things. They can gain access to preexist-
ing accounts, banking, credit cards, and buy things using 
those accounts. Phishers can use the information to open 
brand new banking accounts and credit cards without 
the victim’s knowledge. Finally, the phishers can implant 
viruses into their software that forwards the phishing e-
mail to other recipients once one person responds to the 
original e-mail, thereby luring more potential victims into 
their net. Some common phishing scams are listed in 
 Exhibit 15.3.
Phishing e-mails and websites have become even more 
of a problem now that cybercriminals can easily copy brand 
names, logos, and corporate personnel insignia directly into 
the e-mail. The look is so authentic that victims believe the 
Identity Theft
Identity theft occurs when a person uses the Internet to 
steal someone’s identity and/or impersonate the victim to 
open a new credit card account or conduct some other fi -
nancial transaction. It is a type of cybercrime that has grown 
at surprising rates over the past few years.27
Identity theft can destroy a person’s life by manipulat-
ing credit records or stealing from their bank accounts. 
Identity thieves use a variety of techniques to steal infor-
mation. They may fi ll out change of address cards at the 
post offi ce and obtain people’s credit card bills and bank 
statements. They may then call the credit card issuer and, 
pretending to be the victim, ask for a change in address on 
the account. They can then charge numerous items over 
the Internet and have the merchandise sent to the new 
address. It may take months for the victim to realize the 
fraud because the victim is not getting bills from the credit 
card company.
What are the most common goals of credit card thieves? 
One recent survey (2009) found that opening new lines 
of credit remains the most frequently occurring use for a 
victim’s identity, followed by using personal information 
to make charges on stolen credit cards and debit cards, 
obtaining utilities, applying for bogus personal loans and 
business loans, and check fraud (personal information is 
used to access an existing account via theft or the creation 
of false checks).28
Some identity theft schemes are extremely elaborate. 
In one scam, 19 people were indicted on charges that they 
had created an organization called Shadowcrew to provide 
stolen credit card numbers and identity documents through 
an online marketplace. The stolen account numbers were 
contributed by approved “vendors” who had been granted 
permission to sell on the Shadowcrew site after being vetted 
through a complex review process. Shadowcrew members 
allegedly traffi cked in at least 1.5 million stolen credit card 
numbers and caused total losses in excess of $4 million.29 
While this scheme highlights the seriousness and extent of 
the problem, relatively little is known about the extent of 
identity theft and further research is required to better un-
derstand this growing cybercrime.30
Phishing Some identity thieves create false e-mails or 
websites that look legitimate but are designed to gain illegal 
access to a victim’s personal information; this is known as 
phishing (also known as carding and spoofi ng).
Some phishers send out e-mails that look like they 
come from a credit card company or online store telling 
victims there is a problem with their account credit or bal-
ance. To fi x the problem and update their account, they 
are asked to submit their name, address, phone numbers, 
personal information, credit card account numbers, and 
Social Security number (SSN). Or the e-mail may direct 
them to a phony website that purports to be a legitimate 
company or business enterprise. Once victims access the 
EXHIBIT 15.2 
Reshipping
The reshipping scheme requires individuals in the United 
States to receive packages at their residence and subsequently 
repackage the merchandise for shipment, usually abroad. Re-
shippers are recruited in various ways but most often through 
employment offers and Internet chat rooms.
Unknown subjects post help-wanted advertisements at 
popular Internet job search sites, and respondents quickly 
reply to the online advertisement. The prospective employee 
is required to complete an employment application, which 
requires him or her to divulge sensitive personal information, 
such as his or her date of birth and Social Security number. 
The “employer” then uses this information to get a credit card 
in the victim’s name.
The applicant is informed he or she has been hired and 
will be responsible for forwarding, or reshipping, merchandise 
purchased in the United States to the company’s overseas 
home office. The packages quickly begin to arrive and, as in-
structed, the employee dutifully forwards the packages to their 
overseas destination. The reshipper doesn’t realize that the 
recently received merchandise was purchased with fraudulent 
credit cards—until the victim is charged for the merchandise 
he or she just shipped out of the country!

such as Amazon.Accounts.net. The real company is Ama-
zon, but it does not have Accounts in its domain name. 
These con artists then send out millions of e-mails asking

 There are some companies and governmen-

scam. A bogus e-mail is sent from an alleged representa-
tive of a foreign government asking the victim to help move 
money from one account to another. Some forms include 
requests to help a dying woman or free a political prisoner. 
Some claim that the victim has been the recipient of a leg-
acy or a winning lottery ticket. Nigerian money offers now 
account for about 12 percent of the scam offers.

■
 Originating from the Nether-
lands and other foreign countries, these scams usually ask for 
money to hold the prize until the victim can collect in person.
“Free credit report.”
 
■
 Almost all “free credit report” e-
mails are scams. Either the person is trying to find out the 
victim’s Social Security number or the victim is billed for 
services later on.
“You have won a free gift.” 
 
■
The victims receive an e-mail 
about a free gift or prize. They just have to send their credit 
card info to take care of shipping and handling. Respond-
ing may result in hundreds of spams or telemarketing calls.
E-mail chain letters/pyramid schemes.
 
■
 Victims are sent an 
official looking e-mail requesting cooperation by sending 
a report to five friends or relatives. Those who respond are 
then contacted for money in order to keep the chain going.
“Find out everything on anyone.”
 
■
 This e-mail is trying to 
solicit money by offering a CD or program that victims can 
use to find out personal information on another person. 
However, the information is actually in the public domain 
and can be easily accessed without the program.
Job advertisement scams.

sumer Alerts,” www.idtheftcenter.org (accessed April 15, 2010).
e-mail comes from the advertised company. Most phish-
ers send out spam e-mails to a large number of recipients 
knowing that some of those recipients will have accounts 
with the company they are impersonating.
To meet the increasing threat of phishing and identity 
theft, Congress passed the Identity Theft and Assumption 
Deterrence Act of 1998 (Identity Theft Act) to make it a fed-
eral crime when anyone:
Knowingly transfers or uses, without lawful authority, a 
means of identifi cation of another person with the intent 
to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that 
constitutes a violation of Federal law, or that constitutes 
a felony under any applicable State or local law.31
Violations of the act are investigated by federal inves-
tigative agencies such as the U.S. Secret Service, the FBI, 
and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. In 2004, the Iden-
tity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act was signed into law; 
the act increases existing penalties for the crime of identity 
theft, establishes aggravated identity theft as a criminal of-
fense, and establishes mandatory penalties for aggravated 
identity theft. According to this law, anyone who know-
ingly “transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful author-
ity” someone else’s identifi cation will be sentenced to an 
extra prison term of two years with no possibility of proba-
tion. Committing identity fraud while engaged in crimes 
associated with terrorism—such as aircraft destruction, 
arson, airport violence, or kidnapping top government 
offi cials—will receive a mandatory sentence enhancement 
of fi ve years.32
Vishing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technol-
ogy that allows people to make voice calls using a broad-
band Internet connection instead of a regular (or analog) 
phone line.33 Some VoIP services only allow subscribers 
to call other people using the same service, but others al-
low you to call anyone who has a telephone number—
including local, long distance, mobile, and international 
numbers. Also, while some VoIP services only work over a 
computer or a special VoIP phone, others allow traditional 
phone hookups connected to a VoIP adapter. Cyber thieves 
have already employed this technology in identity theft 
schemes.
In one version, the victim receives an e-mail that gives 
him or her a number to call. Those who call this “customer 
service” number (a VoIP account, not a real fi nancial insti-
tution) are led through a series of voice-prompted menus 
that ask for account numbers, passwords, and other criti-
cal information. In another version, the victim is contacted 
over the phone instead of by e-mail. The call is either a live 
person or a recorded message directing the victim to take 
action to protect a personal account. The visher may have 
collected some personal information, including account or 
credit card numbers, which can create a false sense of secu-
rity for the victim.34

528  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
CYBERVANDALISM: 
CYBERCRIME WITH 
MALICIOUS INTENT
The nation was stunned when on March 
30, 2008, six teenage girls in Lake-
land, Florida, beat a young classmate, a 
16-year-old cheerleader, for over half an 
hour. What made the attack an issue of 
national concern was that it was fi lmed 
and put on YouTube. The attackers, 
seemingly proud of their destructive act, 
wanted it to be viewed by the public on 
the Internet. The attack may have been 
motivated as retaliation for comments 
the victim posted on her MySpace page 
about some of the other girls.37
Some cybercriminals may not be 
motivated by greed or profi t, but by the 
desire for revenge and destruction, and 
to achieve a malicious intent (such as a 
denial-of-service attack launched in re-
taliation for some slight). Cybervandal-
ism ranges from sending destructive viruses and worms to 
stalking or bullying people using cyberspace as a medium. 
Cybervandals may want to damage or deface websites or 
even as Exhibit 15.5 reveals, pull a virtual fi re alarm!
Cybervandals are motivated more by malice than greed:
Some cybervandals target computers and networks 
 
■
seeking revenge for some perceived wrong.
Some desire to exhibit their technical prowess and 
 
■
superiority.
Some wish to highlight the vulnerability of computer 
 
■
security systems (see the Profi les in Crime feature).
Some desire to spy on other people’s private fi nancial 
 
■
and personal information (computer voyeurism).
Some want to destroy computer security because they 
 
■
believe in a philosophy of open access to all systems 
and programs.38
What forms does cybervandalism take?
Worms, Viruses, Trojan Horses, Logic 
Bombs, and Spam
The most typical use of cyberspace for destructive intent 
comes in the sending or implanting of disruptive programs, 
called viruses, worms, Trojan horses, logic bombs, and spam.
Viruses and Worms A computer virus is one type of ma-
licious software program (also called malware) that disrupts 
or destroys existing programs and networks, causing them 
Twenty-five-year-old Robert Beck of O’Fallon, Missouri, ignored his distrust of online auctions 
and paid $1,900 for a top-of-the-line home theater speaker system. It never arrived. He was not 
the sole victim of this scheme: the sellers scammed at least 500 people of more than $100,000. 
Etailing schemes vary widely and are hard to control because many scam artists operate from 
overseas locations. What can be done to reduce etailing fraud?
Etailing Fraud
New fraud schemes are evolving to refl ect the fact that bil-
lions of dollars in goods are sold on the Internet each year. 
Etailing fraud can involve both illegally buying and selling 
merchandise on the Net.
Not only do etail frauds involve selling merchandise, 
they can also involve buyer fraud. One scam involves pur-
chasing top of the line electronic equipment over the Net 
and then purchasing a second, similar looking but cheaper 
model of the same brand. The cheaper item is then returned 
to the etailer after switching bar codes and boxes with the 
more expensive unit. Because etail return processing cen-
ters don’t always check returned goods closely, they may 
send a refund for the value of the higher priced model.
In another tactic, called shoplisting, a person obtains a 
legitimate receipt from a store either by buying it from a 
customer or fi nding it in the trash and then returns to the 
store and, casually shopping, picks up an identical product. 
He then takes the product and receipt to the returns depart-
ments and attempts to return it for cash, store credit, or a 
gift card. The thief then sells the gift card on the Internet 
at a discount for quick cash. Not surprisingly, the under-
ground market for receipts has been growing, as stores have 
liberalized return policies.35 Some of the most common 
fraud schemes are included in Exhibit 15.4. Before you say, 
“how could anyone fall for this stuff?” remember that more 
than 200,000 people fi le complaints with the government’s 
Internet fraud center each year and these scams create more 
than $240 million in losses each year.36

EXHIBIT 15.4 
Common Internet Fraud Schemes
Hitman Scam 
The victim receives an e-mail from a member of an organiza-
tion such as the “Ishmael Ghost Islamic Group.” The e-mailer 
claims to have been sent to assassinate the victim and the vic-
tim’s family members. The e-mailer asserts that the reason for 
the impending assassination resulted from an alleged offense, 
by the victim, against a member of the e-mailer’s gang. In a bi-
zarre twist, however, the e-mailer reveals that upon obtaining the 
victim’s information, another member of the gang (purported 
to know a member of the victim’s extended family) pleaded for 
the victim’s pardon. The e-mailer alleges that an agreement was 
reached with the pleading gang member to allow the victim par-
don from assassination if the victim takes some action such as 
sending $800 to a receiver in the United Kingdom for the mi-
gration of Islamic expatriates from the United States. Victims of 
this e-mail are typically instructed to send the money via Western 
Union or Money Gram to a receiver in the United Kingdom. The 
e-mailer often gives the victim 72 hours to send the money or 
else pay with his/her life.
Economic Stimulus Scam 
Another popular scam involves unsolicited calls regarding fraud-
ulent “government stimulus money.” The Internet Crime Com-
plaint Center (IC3) received numerous complaints from victims 
receiving unsolicited telephone calls with a recorded message. 
The recorded voice message reportedly sounds very much like 
President Barack Obama discussing alleged government funds 
available for those who apply. Victims are warned that the offer 
is only available for a limited time and are instructed to visit cer-
tain websites to receive their money. These sites require victims 
to enter personal identifying information after which they are di-
rected to a second page to receive notification of eligibility. Upon 
completion of an online application and payment of small fees, 
victims are guaranteed to receive a large sum of stimulus money, 
but they never do.
Pet Scams 
A self-proclaimed breeder posts an online ad (along with a cute 
picture or even a streaming video) offering to sell a pet. The 
breeder asks the buyer to send in money, plus a little extra for 
delivery costs. But the buyer never gets the pet; the scam artist 
simply takes the money and runs.
Secret Shoppers and Funds Transfer Scams 
Individuals are hired via the Web to rate experiences while shop-
ping or dining. They are paid by check and asked to wire a per-
centage of the money to a third party. The check they had been 
sent bounces, and they are out the money they sent to the other 
party. As part of the scam, the fraudsters often use real logos 
from legitimate companies.
Adoption and Charity Fraud 
A person is sent an e-mail that tugs on his or her heartstrings, 
asking for a pressing donation to a charity and often using the 
subject header, “Urgent Assistance Is Needed.” The name of a 
real charity is generally used, but the information provided sends 
the money to a con artist. One set of scams used the name of a 
legitimate British adoption agency to ask for money for orphaned 
or abandoned children.
Romance Fraud 
A person encounters someone in an online dating or social net-
working site who lives far away or in another country. That per-
son strikes up a relationship with him or her and then wants to 
meet, but needs money to cover travel expenses. Typically, that’s 
just the beginning—the person may claim to have been taken 
ill or injured during the journey and ask for money to pay the 
hospital expenses.

to perform the task for which the virus was designed.39 The 
virus is then spread from one computer to another when a 
user sends out an infected fi le through e-mail, a network, 
or a disk. Computer worms are similar to viruses but use 
computer networks or the Internet to self-replicate and send 
themselves to other users, generally via e-mail, without the 
aid of the operator.
Trojan Horses Some hackers introduce a Trojan horse 
program into a computer system. The Trojan horse looks 
like a benign application but contains illicit codes that can 
damage the system operations. Sometimes hackers with a 
sense of irony will install a Trojan horse and claim that it is 
an antivirus program. When it is opened, it spreads viruses 
in the computer system. Though Trojan horses do not repli-
cate themselves like viruses, they can be just as destructive.
Logic Bombs A fourth type of destructive attack that can 
be launched on a computer system is the logic bomb, a pro-
gram that is secretly attached to a computer system, moni-
tors the network’s work output, and waits for a particular 
signal such as a date to appear. Also called a slag code, it is a 
type of delayed-action virus that may be set off when a pro-
gram user makes certain input that sets it in motion. A logic 
bomb may cause a variety of problems ranging from display-
ing or printing a spurious message to deleting or corrupting 
data. For example, William Shea was convicted of placing 
malicious computer code on the network of Bay Area Credit

of a spreadsheet, to deface 
the Institute’s home page 
and post their mission state-
ment. Calling themselves “the 
Deceptive Duo,” Lyttle and 
Stark stated that their attacks 
were intended to demonstrate 
vulnerabilities in the govern-
ment’s computer security 
systems. They described 
themselves as anonymous cit-
izens determined to save the 
country from cyberterrorists 
by exposing security cracks in 
critical computer network in-
frastructures. “Tighten the se-
curity before a foreign attack forces you to,” 
the Duo’s defacements read. “At a time like 
this, we cannot risk the possibility of com-
promise by a foreign enemy.” Accompany-
ing the text was a graphic of two handguns 
against the backdrop of a tattered American 
flag. The pair also hacked into the Defense 
Department’s Defense Logistics Information 
Service website and the agency’s Office of 
Health Affairs. They also tapped into one of 
the U.S. Navy’s databases, which contained 
classified and unclassified e-mail addresses 
and phone numbers of a number of Naval 
officers, and then posted the information on 
a publicly available website.
Lyttle pleaded guilty to the attacks, and 
the U.S. District Court in Oakland, Califor-
nia, sentenced him to four months in prison, 
a payment of restitution of $71,181, and 
three years of probation. Stark, who also 
pleaded guilty, was sentenced to two years 
of probation and ordered to pay restitution 
of $29,006.

Swatting
Cybervandals have developed a new form of “entertainment” 
called “swatting”: calling 911 and faking an emergency that draws 
a response from law enforcement—usually a SWAT team. The 
callers often tell tales of hostages about to be executed or bombs 
about to go off. The community is placed in danger as responders 
rush to the scene, taking them away from real emergencies. And 
the officers are placed in danger as unsuspecting residents may 
try to defend themselves. In one case, a swatter in Washington 
State was charged with pretending to be calling from the home of 
a California couple, saying he had just shot and murdered some-
one. A local SWAT team arrived on the scene, and the husband, 
who had been asleep in his home with his wife and two young 
children, heard something and went outside to investigate—after 
first stopping in the kitchen to pick up a knife. What he found was 
a group of SWAT assault rifles aimed directly at him. Fortunately, 
the situation didn’t escalate, and no one was injured.
Swatters have become more sophisticated in their targets and 
use of technology. Consider the following Texas case:
Five swatters in several states targeted people who were us-
ing online telephone party chat lines (or their family or friends). 
The swatters found personal details on the victims by  accessing 
telecommunication company  information stored on protected 
computers. Then, by  manipulating computer and phone equip-
ment, they called 911 operators around the country. By using 
“spoofi ng technology,” the swatters even made it look like the 
calls were actually coming from the victims!
Between 2002 and 2006, the five swatters called 911 lines in 
more than 60 cities nationwide, impacting more than 100 vic-
tims, causing a disruption of services for telecommunications 
providers and emergency responders, and resulting in up to 
$250,000 in losses. “Swats” that the group committed included 
using bomb threats at sporting events, causing the events to be 
delayed; claiming that hotel visitors were armed and dangerous, 
causing an evacuation of the entire hotel; and making threats 
against public parks and officials.

ting’,” www.fbi.gov/page2/feb08/swatting020408.html (accessed

Services, of San Jose, California, that caused the deletion 
and modifi cation of fi nancial records and disruption of the 
proper functioning of the company’s computer network.40
Shea’s bomb affected more than 50,000 debtor accounts and 
caused the company more than $100,000 in damages. Shea, 
a disgruntled former employee, still had administrative level 
access to and familiarity with the company’s computer sys-
tems, including the database server. Company offi cials did 
not know when he left the company that he had placed mali-
cious code on the computer network that was set to modify 
and delete data at the end of the month.
Spam An unsolicited advertisement or promotional ma-
terial, spam typically comes in the form of an unwanted 
 e-mail message; spammers use electronic communications 
to send unsolicited messages in bulk. While e-mail is the 
most common form of spam, it can also be sent via instant 
messaging, online newsgroup, and mobile phone messag-
ing, among other media.
Spam can simply be in the form of an unwanted and 
unwelcome advertisement. For example, it may advertise 
sexually explicit websites and get into the hands of minors. 
A more dangerous and malicious form of spam contains a 
Trojan horse disguised as an e-mail attachment advertis-
ing some commodity such as free software or an electronic 
game. If the recipient downloads or opens the attachment, a 
virus may be launched that corrupts the victim’s computer. 
The Trojan horse may also be designed to capture important 
data from the victim’s hard drive and send it back to the 
hacker’s e-mail address.
Sending spam can become a crime and even lead to a 
prison sentence when it causes serious harm to a computer 
or network.
Website Defacement
Cybervandals may aim their attention at the websites of 
their victims. Website defacement is a type of cybervan-
dalism that occurs when a computer hacker intrudes on 
another person’s website by inserting or substituting codes 
that expose visitors to the site to misleading or provoca-
tive information. Defacement can range from installing 
humorous graffi ti to sabotaging or corrupting the site. In 
some instances, defacement efforts are not easily apparent 
or noticeable—for example when they are designed to give 
misinformation by substituting or replacing authorized text 
on a company’s web page. The false information may mis-
lead customers and frustrate their efforts to utilize the site or 
make it diffi cult for people using search engines to fi nd the 
site as they surf the Net.
Almost all defacement attacks are designed to vandalize 
web pages rather than bring profi t or gain to the intruders 
(though some defacers may eventually extort money from 
their targets). Some defacers are simply trying to impress 
the hacking community with their skills. Others may target 
a corporation when they oppose its business practices and 
policies (such as oil companies, tobacco companies, or de-
fense contractors). Some defacement has political goals such 
as disrupting the website of a rival political party or fund-
raising group. 
Content analysis of web page defacements indicates that 
about 70 percent are pranks instituted by hackers, while the 
rest have a political motive. Defacers are typically members 
of an extensive social network who are eager to demonstrate 
their reasons for hacking and often leave calling cards, greet-
ings, and taunts on web pages.41
Website defacement is a signifi cant and major threat to 
online businesses and government agencies. It can harm the 
credibility and reputation of the organization and demonstrate 
that its security measures are inadequate. As a result, clients 
lose trust and may be reluctant to share information such as 
credit card numbers and personal information. An etailer may 
lose business if potential clients believe the site is not secure. 
Financial institutions, such as web-based banks and broker-
age houses, are particularly vulnerable because they rely on 
security and credibility to protect their clients’ accounts.42
Cyberstalking
For two years, Georges DeBeir contacted adolescent girls 
he met in Internet chat rooms and promised them gifts and 
money in exchange for sex. Finally he went too far. DeBeir 
initiated a conversation in a “teen sex” chat room with a 
14-year-old Baltimore girl named Kathy. After weeks of trad-
ing explicit e-mail messages, DeBeir eventually asked Kathy 
to meet him in person for sex, all the while stressing the im-
portance of keeping their relationship confi dential. Unfor-
tunately for DeBeir, “Kathy” was actually an undercover FBI 
agent working for Innocent Images, a computer crimes unit 
targeting sexual predators and child pornographers on the 
Internet. DeBeir was arrested at a Baltimore shopping mall 
where he had arranged to meet Kathy. He pleaded guilty to 
one count of traveling interstate with the intent to have sex 
with a minor, a federal charge that carries with it a maxi-
mum sentence of 10 years in prison.43
Cyberstalking refers to the use of the Internet, e-mail, 
or other electronic communication devices to stalk another 
person.44 Traditional stalking involves repeated harassing or 
threatening behavior, such as following a person, appearing 
at a person’s home or place of business, making harassing 
phone calls, leaving written messages or objects, or vandal-
izing a person’s property. In the Internet age, stalkers, such 
as Georges DeBeir, can pursue victims through online chat 
rooms. Pedophiles can use the Internet to establish a rela-
tionship with the child, and later make contact for the pur-
pose of engaging in criminal sexual activities. Research by 
Janis Wolak and her colleagues found that publicity about 
online “predators” who prey on naive children using trick-
ery and violence is largely inaccurate. Today, Internet preda-
tors are more likely to meet, develop relationships with

at-risk adolescents, and beguile underage teenagers, rather 
than use coercion and violence.45
Not all cyberstalkers are sexual predators. Some send 
repeated threatening or harassing messages via e-mail and 
use programs to send messages at regular or random inter-
vals without being physically present at a computer termi-
nal. A cyberstalker may trick other people into harassing or 
threatening a victim by impersonating the victim on Inter-
net bulletin boards or chat rooms, posting messages that are 
provocative, such as “I want to have sex.” The stalker then 
posts the victim’s name, phone number, or e-mail address 
hoping that other chat participants will stalk or hassle the 
victim without the stalker’s personal involvement.
Cyberbullying
Experts defi ne bullying among children as repeated nega-
tive acts committed by one or more children against an-
other. These negative acts may be physical or verbal in 
nature—for example, hitting or kicking, teasing or taunt-
ing—or they may involve indirect actions such as manip-
ulating friendships or purposely excluding other children 
from activities. Implicit in this defi nition is an imbalance in 
real or perceived power between the bully and the victim. 
It may come as no surprise that 30 to 50 percent of gay, 
lesbian, and bisexual young people experience harassment 
in an educational setting.46
Studies of bullying suggest that there are short- and long-
term consequences for both the perpetrators and the victims 
of bullying. Students who are chronic victims of bullying 
experience more physical and psychological problems than 
their peers who are not harassed by other children, and they 
tend not to grow out of the role of victim. Young people 
mistreated by peers may not want to be in school and may 
thereby miss out on the benefi ts of school connectedness as 
well as educational advancement. Longitudinal studies have 
found that victims of bullying in early grades also reported 
being bullied several years later.47 Chronically victimized 
students may, as adults, be at increased risk for depression, 
poor self-esteem, and other mental health problems, includ-
ing schizophrenia.48
While bullying is a problem that remains to be solved, it 
has now morphed from the physical to the virtual. Because 
of the creation of cyberspace, physical distance is no longer 
a barrier to the frequency and depth of harm doled out by a 
bully to his or her victim.49 Cyberbullying is now defi ned 
as the willful and repeated harm infl icted through the me-
dium of electronic text. Like their real-world counterparts, 
cyberbullies are malicious aggressors who seek implicit or 
explicit pleasure or profi t through the mistreatment of other 
individuals. Although power in traditional bullying might 
be physical (stature) or social (competency or popularity), 
online power may simply stem from net profi ciency. Cyber-
bullies are able to navigate the Net and utilize technology 
in a way that puts them in a position of power relative to 
their victim. There are two major formats that bullies can 
employ to harass their victims: (1) a cyberbully can use a 
computer and send harassing e-mails or instant messages, 
post obscene, insulting, and slanderous messages to online 
bulletin boards or social networking sites, or develop web-
sites to promote and disseminate defamatory content; (2) a 
cyberbully can use a cell phone to send harassing text mes-
sages to the victim.50
How common is cyberbullying? Sameer Hinduja and 
Justin Patchin, leading experts on cyberbullying, have con-
ducted yearly surveys using large samples of high school 
youth. Their most recent effort (2010) finds that about 
20 percent of the more than 4,000 high school and junior 
high school students they surveyed report having been the 
target of some form of Internet harassment. When asked 
about specifi c types of cyberbullying (Figure 15.1) in the 
previous 30 days, mean or hurtful comments (14 percent) 
and rumors spread online (13 percent) are the most com-
monly cited. In all, about 17 percent of the sample reported 
being cyberbullied two or more times over the course of the 
Megan Meier, 13, committed suicide after receiving cruel messages on 
Myspace in St. Charles, Mo., from Lori Drew, the mother of one of 
Megan’s former friends. Drew was convicted November 26, 2008, of 
three minor offenses but the conviction was later set aside on technical 
grounds. Ironically, in the national outrage over the case, the Drews 
have had their home and work addresses, phone and cell phone 
numbers, and aerial photos of their home posted on the Internet; 
their property was vandalized. In response to the case, a number of 
jurisdictions  passed laws making it easier to prosecute people for 
Internet harrassment.

likely to have experienced cyberbullying in their lifetimes. 
The type of cyberbullying tends to differ by gender; girls are 
more likely to spread rumors while boys are more likely to 
post hurtful pictures or videos.51
Cyberspying
On July 21, 2005, Carlos Enrique Perez-Melara, the creator 
and marketer of a spyware program called Loverspy, was in-
dicted by a federal grand jury and charged with such crimes 
as manufacturing a surreptitious interception device, send-
ing a surreptitious interception device, and advertising a 
surreptitious interception device.52
Loverspy was a computer program designed and mar-
keted by Perez for people to use to spy on others. Prospec-
tive purchasers, after paying $89 through a website based 
in Texas, were electronically redirected to Perez’s comput-
ers in San Diego. Purchasers would then select an electronic 
greeting card to send to up to fi ve different victims’ e-mail 
addresses. Unbeknownst to the victims, once the e-mail 
greeting card was opened, Loverspy secretly installed itself 
on their computer and recorded all their activities, including 
e-mails sent and received, websites visited, and passwords 
entered. Loverspy also gave the purchaser the ability to re-
motely control the victim’s computer, including accessing, 
changing, and deleting fi les, and turning on web-enabled

elsewhere purchased Loverspy and used it against more 
than 2,000 victims.53
Perez was indicted for engaging in cyberspying, illegally 
using the Internet to gather information considered private 
and confi dential. Cyberspies have a variety of motivations. 
Some are people involved in marital disputes who may want 
to seize the e-mails of their estranged spouse. Business rivals 
might hire disgruntled former employees, consultants, or 
outside contractors to steal information from their competi-
tors. These commercial cyberspies target upcoming bids, 
customer lists, product designs, software source code, voice 
mail messages, and confi dential e-mail messages.54 Some 
of the commercial spying is conducted by foreign competi-
tors who seek to appropriate trade secrets in order to gain a 
business advantage.55
While spyware to monitor Internet messages and traf-
fi c has become common, spying by government agencies on 
U.S. citizens remains quite controversial. Case in point was 
the FBI’s web tracking program called Carnivore, whose use 
was a great concern to civil libertarians. The FBI used the 
device to obtain e-mail headers and other information with-
out a wiretap under the USA Patriot Act. Under section 216 
of the act, the FBI can conduct a limited form of Internet 
surveillance without fi rst visiting a judge and establishing 
probable cause that the target has committed a crime. In 
such cases the FBI is authorized to capture routing informa-
tion such as e-mail addresses or IP addresses, but not the

CYBERWARFARE: 
CYBERCRIME WITH 
POLITICAL MOTIVES
It is now generally accepted and understood that the 
developed world is totally dependant upon electronic 
communication and data storage for its survival. The 
protection of the key critical technological infrastruc-
ture of a nation has been raised in priority so that it is 
now considered by many countries alongside the other 
traditional aspects of national defense.57
Some cybercriminals are politically motivated. They may be 
employed by intelligence agencies to penetrate computer
networks at an enemy nation’s most sensitive military bases, 
defense contractors, and aerospace companies in order to 
steal important data. In one well-known cyberespionage
case, Chinese agents were able to penetrate computers, enter 
hidden sections of a hard drive, zip up as many fi les as pos-
sible, and transmit the data to way-stations in South Korea, 
The president’s national security advisor approaches 
you with a problem. It seems that a tracking device 
has been developed that can be implanted under 
the skin that will allow people to be constantly moni-
tored. Implanted at birth, the data surveillance de-
vice could potentially cover everyone, with a record 
of every transaction and activity they engage in en-
tered into databases monitored by powerful search 
engines that would keep them under constant 
surveillance. The surveillance device would en-
able the government to keep tabs on their where-
abouts as well as monitoring biological activities 
such as brain waves, heart rate, and so on. The benefits are immense. 
Once a person becomes a suspect in a crime or is believed to be part 
of a terrorist cell, he or she can be easily monitored from a distance 
without danger to any government agent. The suspect cannot hide or 
escape detection. Physical readings could be made to determine if 
the suspect is under stress, using banned substances, and so on.
❯❯ The director wants you to write a paper 
for the NSA expressing your opinion on 
this device. You begin by reading what the 
American Civil Liberties Union has to say: 
“The United States is at risk of turning into 
a full-fledged surveillance society. The tre-
mendous explosion in surveillance-enabling 
technologies, combined with the ongoing 
weakening in legal restraints that protect our 
privacy, mean that we are drifting toward a 
surveillance society. The good news is that it 
can be stopped. Unfortunately, right now the 
big picture is grim.”
Is it worthwhile considering the threats faced by America from 
terrorists and criminals or, as the ACLU suggests, would it be 
unethical because it violates the personal privacy and freedom 
of people before they have broken any law?

Hong Kong, and Taiwan before sending them to mainland 
China. The spy ring, known as Titan Rain, is thought to 
rank among the most pervasive cyberespionage threats ever 
faced by computer networks in the United States. It is be-
lieved that the agents have compromised networks rang-
ing from the Redstone Arsenal military base to NASA to the 
World Bank; the U.S. Army’s fl ight-planning software has 
also been electronically stolen. Hundreds of Defense De-
partment computer systems have been penetrated, and sim-
ilar attacks have been launched against classifi ed systems in 
Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.58 In 2008, the 
Pentagon issued a report on China’s “Cyberwarfare Capabili-
ties,” acknowledging that hackers in China has penetrated 
the Pentagon’s computer system and that the intrusions ap-
parently from China into computer networks used “many 
of the skills and capabilities that would also be required 
for computer network attack.” While it was not clear if the 
hackers acted alone or were backed by the Chinese military, 
there was ample evidence of Chinese interest in cyberespio-
nage as part of their long-term strategy.59
In another well-known cyber attack, the secretary gen-
eral of the International Atomic Energy Agency announced 
that on November 23, 2010, Iran had been forced to shut 
down its main uranium enrichment plant at Natanz for 
seven days after it was targeted by the Stuxnet computer 
worm. Experts believe that Stuxnet was specifically de-
signed to attack systems at the plant that control the speed 
at which the enrichment centrifuges spin. The source of the 
attack remains unknown, but suspects include the United 
States and Israel security agencies.60

CHAPTER 15 | Crimes of the New Millennium: Cybercrime and Transnational Organized Crime  535
Cyberterrorism
The justice system must now also be on guard against at-
tacks that integrate terrorist goals with cyber capabilities: 
cyberterrorism. While the term may be diffi cult to defi ne, 
cyberterrorism can be seen as an effort by covert forces to 
disrupt the intersection where the virtual electronic real-
ity of computers meets the physical world.61 FBI expert 
Mark Pollitt defi nes cyberterrorism as “the premeditated, 
politically motivated attack against information, computer 
systems, computer programs, and data which results in vio-
lence against noncombatant targets by subnational groups 
or clandestine agents.”62
Terrorist organizations are beginning to understand the 
power that cybercrime can inflict on their enemies even 
though, ironically, they may come from a region where com-
puter databases and the Internet are not widely used. Terror-
ist organizations are adapting IT into their arsenal of terror, 
and agencies of the justice system have to be ready for a 
sustained attack on the nation’s electronic infrastructure.
Why Terrorism in Cyberspace?
Cyberspace is a handy battlefi eld for the terrorist because an 
attack can strike directly at a target that bombs won’t affect: 
the economy. Because technological change plays a signifi -
cant role in the development of critical infrastructures, they 
are particularly vulnerable to attack. And because of rapid 
technological change, and the interdependence of systems, 
it is diffi cult to defend against efforts to disrupt services.63
Cyberterrorists have many advantages. There are no bor-
ders of legal control, making it diffi cult for prosecutors to ap-
ply laws to some crimes. Criminals can operate from countries 
where cyber laws barely exist, making them almost untouch-
able. Cyberterrorists can also use the Internet and hacking 
tools to gather information on targets.64 There is no loss of 
life and no need to infi ltrate “enemy” territory. Terrorists can 
commit crimes from anyplace in the world, and the costs are 
minimal. Nor do terror organizations lack for skilled labor to 
mount cyber attacks. There are a growing number of highly 
skilled computer experts who are available at reasonable costs 
in developing countries. Cyberterrorism may result in a bat-
tered economy in which the government is forced to spend 
more on the military and cut back on social programs and 
education. These outcomes can weaken the terrorists’ target 
and undermine its resolve to continue to resist.
Cyber Attacks
Has the United States already been the target of cyber attacks? 
While it may be diffi cult to separate the damage caused by 
hackers from deliberate attacks by terrorists, the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies has uncovered attacks on 
the National Security Agency, the Pentagon, and a nuclear 
In April 2007, two suicide car bomb attacks rocked the city of Algiers 
in Algeria, damaging the prime minister’s office, killing at least 23 
people, and injuring more than 160. Al-Qaeda’s branch in North Africa 
claimed responsibility for the attacks, publishing photographs of what it 
said were the three suicide bombers in an Internet statement. This 
picture allegedly shows one of the suicide bombers responsible for the 
attack. The Arabic writing says, “The Martyr al-Zubair Abu Sajda.”

weapons laboratory; operations were disrupted at all of these 
sites.65 The fi nancial service sector is a prime target and has 
been victimized by information warfare. One survey found 
that in a single year fi nancial service fi rms received an aver-
age of 1,018 attacks per company, and 46 percent of these 
fi rms had at least one server attack during the period.66
Computers can be used by terrorist groups to remain 
connected and communicate covertly with agents around 
the world. Networks are a cost-effective tool for planning 
and striking.67 They enable terror groups to plan and carry 
out a variety of Internet-related attacks. Here are some pos-
sible scenarios:
Logic bombs are implanted in an enemy’s computer. 
 
■
They can go undetected for years until they are instructed 
through the Internet to overwhelm a computer system.
Programs are used to allow terrorists to enter “secure”

systems and disrupt or destroy the network.
Using conventional weapons, terrorists overload a net-

work’s electrical system, thereby threatening computer 
security.68

is vital to national security—such as Boeing or Ray-

structure needs—such as an oil pipeline’s fl ow or water 
levels in dams—are attacked and disrupted, posing a 
danger of loss of life and interruption of services.

tem. In ever-increasing numbers people are spending and

investing their money electronically, using online banking, 
credit card payment, and online brokerage services. The 
banking/fi nancial system transacts billions of dollars each 
day through a complex network of institutions and sys-
tems. Effi cient and secure electronic functioning is required 
if people are willing to conduct credit and debit card pur-
chases, money transfers, and stock trading. A cyber attack 
can disrupt these transactions and interfere with the nation’s 
economic well-being.69
Terrorists can use the Internet to recruit new members 
and disseminate information. For example, Islamic militant 
organizations use the Internet to broadcast anti-Western slo-
gans and information. An organization’s charter and politi-
cal philosophy can be displayed on its website, which can 
also be used to solicit funds.
One attack method is to release a botnet or software ro-
bot, also known as a zombie or drone, that allows an unau-
thorized user to remotely take control of a host computer 
without the victim’s knowledge or permission.70 Infected 
computers can be used to launch denial-of-service attacks, 
send spam and spyware, or commit cyber extortion. In one 
attack, a global telecommunications company with a busi-
ness unit in Central America experienced several unusual 
problems, including multiple network outages—some 
lasting up to six hours—which disrupted businesses and 
national connectivity, and took automated teller machines 
offl ine for extended periods of time. A botnet-based dis-
tributed denial-of-service attack had crippled the country’s 
infrastructure.71
Funding Terrorist Activities
Terrorist groups have used the Internet to conduct white-
collar crimes in order to raise funds to buy arms and carry 
out operations.72 One method of funding is through fraudu-
lent charitable organizations claiming to support a particu-
lar cause such as disaster relief or food services. Charitable 
organizations in the United States raise more than $130 bil-
lion per year. Using bogus charities to raise money is par-
ticularly attractive to cyberterrorists because they face far 
less scrutiny from the government than for-profi t corpora-
tions and individuals. They may also qualify for fi nancial as-
sistance from government-sponsored grant programs. One 
such bogus group, Holy Land Foundation for Relief and De-
velopment (HLFRD) provided more than $12 million to the 
terrorist group Hamas; in total, HLFRD raised more than 
$57 million but only reported $36.2 million to the IRS.73
Bogus companies have also been used by terrorist groups 
to receive and distribute money. These shell companies may 
engage in legitimate activities to establish a positive reputa-
tion in the business community but produce bills for nonex-
istent products that are “paid” by another party with profi ts 
from illegal activities, such as insurance fraud or identity 
theft.74 If a shell company generates revenues, funds can be 
distributed by altering fi nancial statements to hide profi ts 
and then depositing the profi ts in accounts that are used di-
rectly or indirectly to support terrorist activities.
Another source of terrorist funding, which is discussed 
less often in the literature, is intellectual property (IP) crime. 
The illegal sale of counterfeited goods and illegal use of IP 
to commit other crimes, such as stock manipulation, have 
been used to support terrorist activities.75
THE EXTENT AND COSTS 
OF CYBERCRIME
How common are cybercrimes, and how costly are cyber-
crimes to American businesses and the general public? The 
Internet has become a vast engine for illegal profits and 
criminal entrepreneurs. An accurate accounting of cyber-
crime will probably never be made because so many offenses 
go unreported, but there is little doubt that its incidence is 
growing rapidly.
Though thousands of breaches occur each year, most 
are not reported to local, state, or federal authorities. 
Some cybercrime goes unreported because it involves low-
 visibility acts—such as copying computer software in vio-
lation of copyright laws—that simply never get detected.76 
Some businesses choose not to report cybercrime because 
they fear revealing the weaknesses in their network secu-
rity systems. However, the information that is available in-
dicates that the profi t in cybercrime is vast and continually 
growing.77 Losses are now in the billions and rising with 
the continuing growth of e-commerce. 
The proliferation of cybercrime and its cost to the econ-
omy have created the need for new laws and enforcement 
processes specifi cally aimed at controlling its emerging for-
mulations. Because technology evolves so rapidly, the enforce-
ment challenges are particularly vexing. There are numerous 
organizations set up to provide training and support for law 
enforcement agents. In addition, new federal and state laws 
have been aimed at particular areas of high-tech crimes.
Congress has treated computer-related crime as a dis-
tinct federal offense since the passage of the Counterfeit Ac-
cess Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Law in 1984.78 
The 1984 act protected classifi ed U.S. defense and foreign 
relations information, fi nancial institution and consumer re-
porting agency fi les, and access to computers operated for 
the government. The act was supplemented in 1996 by the 
National Information Infrastructure Protection Act (NIIPA), 
which signifi cantly broadens the scope of the law.79
Because cybercrime is relatively new, existing laws some-
times are inadequate to address the problem. Therefore new 
legislation has been drafted to protect the public from the cy-
bercriminal. For example, before October 30, 1998, when the 
Identity Theft and Assumption Act of 1998 became law, there

was no federal statute that made identity 
theft a crime. Today, federal prosecutors 
are making substantial use of the statute 
and are actively prosecuting cases of iden-
tity theft.80
In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the 
NIIPA has been amended by sections of 
the USA Patriot Act to make it easier to 
enforce crimes by terrorists and other 
organized enemies against the nation’s 
computer systems. Subsection 1030(a)(5)
(A)(i) of the act criminalizes knowingly 
causing the transmission of a program, 
code, or command, and as a result, in-
tentionally causing damage to a protected 
computer. This section applies regardless 
of whether the user had authorization 
to access the protected computer; com-
pany insiders and authorized users can 
be culpable for intentional damage to a 
protected computer. The act also prohib-
its intentional access without authoriza-
tion that results in damage but does not 
require intent to damage; the attacker can 
merely be negligent or reckless.
In addition to these main acts, com-
puter-related crimes can also be charged 
under at least 40 different federal stat-
utes. In addition to some of the statutes 
discussed earlier in the chapter, these include the Copyright 
Act and Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the National Sto-
len Property Act, the mail and wire fraud statutes, the Elec-
tronic Communications Privacy Act, the Communications 
Decency Act of 1996, the Child Online Protection Act, the 
Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, and the Internet 
False Identifi cation Prevention Act of 2000.81 Movie pirates 
who use the Internet to sell illegally copied fi lms have led the 
federal government to create the Family Entertainment and 
Copyright Act of 2005. One part of that statute, known as the 
ART Act (Artists’ Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005), 
criminalizes the use of recording equipment to make copies 
of fi lms while in movie theaters. The statute also makes it il-
legal to make a copy of a work in production and put it on 
the Internet so it will be accessible to members of the public 
when the individual making the copy knew or should have 
known the work was intended for commercial distribution.82
International Treaties 
Because cybercrime is essentially global, international coop-
eration is required for its control. The Convention on Cy-
bercrime, ratifi ed by the U.S. Senate in August 2006, is the 
fi rst international treaty that addresses the defi nition and 
enforcement of cybercrime. Now signed by 43 nations, it fo-
cuses on improving investigative techniques and increasing 
Theft of intellectual property has become an international issue, and nations around the globe 
are organizing to thwart cyberthieves. Here, a visitor walks past a salesperson displaying an 
original copy of antivirus software at the Computers Fair in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Malaysia 
said it will launch surprise raids on companies nationwide to ferret out illegal software and 
bring the country’s copyright piracy rate down to at least the global average. From 2008 to 
2009, despite installations of unlicensed software on personal computers in Asia-Pacific 
falling from 61 percent to 59 percent, the commercial value of illegal software rose to over 
US$16.5 billion, according to the Business Software Alliance (BSA).

cooperation among nations. The convention includes a list 
of crimes that each signatory state must incorporate into its 
own law, including such cyber offenses as hacking, distri-
bution of child pornography, and protection of intellectual 
property rights. It also allows law enforcement agencies new 
powers, including the ability to require that an Internet ser-
vice provider monitor a person’s online viewing and search 
choices in real time. The convention also requires signatory 
states to cooperate whenever possible in the investigations 
and prosecution of cybercriminals. The vision is that a com-
mon legal framework will eliminate jurisdictional hurdles to 
facilitate the law enforcement of borderless cybercrimes.83
Carrying out this mandate may be diffi cult to achieve 
given the legal rights afforded U.S. citizens that may not 
be realized by residents of other nations. For example, 
First Amendment protections that restrict the defi nition of 
pornography and obscenity in this country may not apply 
overseas. It is not surprising that watchdog institutions such 
as the ACLU have condemned the treaty and campaigned 
against U.S. participation.84
Cybercrime Enforcement Agencies
To enforce these laws, the federal government is now op-
erating a number of organizations to control cyberfraud. 
One approach is to create working groups that coordinate

the activities of numerous agencies involved in investigat-
ing cybercrime. For example, the Interagency Telemarketing 
and Internet Fraud Working Group brings together repre-
sentatives of numerous U.S. attorneys’ offi ces, the FBI, the 
Secret Service, the Postal Inspection Service, the Federal 
Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion, and other law enforcement and regulatory agencies 
to share information about trends and patterns in Internet 
fraud schemes.85
Specialized enforcement agencies have been created. 
The Internet Fraud Complaint Center, based in Fairmont, 
West Virginia, is run by the FBI and the National White-
Collar Crime Center. It brings together about 1,000 state 
and local law enforcement offi cials and regulators. Its goal is 
to analyze fraud-related complaints in order to fi nd distinct 
patterns, develop information on particular cases, and send 
investigative packages to law enforcement authorities in the 
jurisdiction that appears likely to have the greatest investi-
gative interest in the matter. The center now receives more 
than 200,000 complaints each year, including auction fraud, 
nondelivery, and credit/debit card fraud, as well as non-
fraudulent complaints, such as computer intrusions, spam/
unsolicited e-mail, and child pornography.86 Law enforce-
ment has made remarkable strides in dealing with identity 
theft as a crime problem over the last several years.
One of the most successful federal efforts is the New 
York Electronic Crimes Task Force (NYECTF), a partnership 
between the U.S. Secret Service and a host of other public 
safety agencies and private corporations. The task force con-
sists of more than 250 individual members representing fed-
eral, state, and local law enforcement, the private sector, and 
computer science specialists from 18 different universities. 
Since 1995, the New York task force has charged more than 
1,000 individuals with electronic crime losses exceeding 
$1 billion. It has trained more than 60,000 law enforcement 
personnel, prosecutors, and private industry representatives 
in cybercrime prevention. Its success has prompted similar 
electronic crime task forces to be set up in Boston, Miami, 
Charlotte, Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, 
and Washington, D.C.87
Local Enforcement Efforts
Local police departments are now creating special units 
to crack down on cybercriminals. In Toronto, Canada, the 
police department’s child-exploitation section concentrates 
on cracking high profi le and diffi cult cases of Internet child 
pornography, using inventive and aggressive investigative 
methods. The unit looks for even the smallest clues to lead 
them to perpetrators. In one well-known case, investiga-
tors homed in on a computer keyboard where the character 
n~—unique to Spanish—was visible. In the same series of 
pictures, they noticed a train ticket that appeared to be Eu-
ropean in a child’s hand. Sharing the information with Inter-
pol, the international police consortium led to the break-up 
of a sadistic child-porn ring operating south of Madrid led 
by a man who had been using his position as a babysitter to 
gain access to small children.88

TRANSNATIONAL 
ORGANIZED CRIME
On June 10, 2010, the Department of Justice announced the 
arrest of more than 2,200 individuals on narcotics-related 
charges in the United States.89 The two-year investigation, 
involving more than 3,000 agents and offi cers, targeted the 
transportation infrastructure of Mexican drug traffi cking or-
ganizations in the United States, especially along the south-
west border, through coordination between federal, state, 
and local law enforcement. One of those seized was Car-
los Ramon Castro-Rocha, an alleged heroin traffi cker who 
was designated a Consolidated Priority Organization Tar-
get (CPOT), a designation reserved by federal enforcement 
agencies for signifi cant narcotics traffi ckers who are believed 
to be the leaders of drug traffi cking organizations respon-
sible for the importation of large quantities of narcotics into 
the United States. Overall, Project Deliverance led to the 
seizure of approximately $154 million in U.S. currency and 
approximately 1,262 pounds of methamphetamine, 2.5 tons 
of cocaine, 1,410 pounds of heroin, 69 tons of marijuana, 
501 weapons, and 527 vehicles.
The investigative efforts in Project Deliverance were co-
ordinated by the multi-agency Special Operations Division, 
comprised of agents and analysts from the DEA, FBI, ICE, 
Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion, U.S. Marshals Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco, Firearms, and Explosives, as well as attorneys from 
the Criminal Division’s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Sec-
tion. More than 300 federal, state, local, and foreign law 
enforcement agencies contributed investigative and prosecu-
torial resources to Project Deliverance, many of which were 
through the High Intensity Drug Traffi cking Area (HIDTA) 
Task Forces and the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement 
Task Forces (OCDETFs). Signifi cant assistance for Project 
Deliverance was also provided by the Criminal Division’s 
Offi ce of International Affairs.

means. Here a structured enterprise system is set up to con-

This section briefl y defi nes organized 
crime, reviews its history, and discusses 
its economic effect and control.
Characteristics of 
Transnational Organized 
Crime
A precise description of the characteris-
tics of transnational organized crime is 
diffi cult to formulate, but here are some 
of its general traits:91
Transnational organized crime is a 
 
■
conspiratorial activity, involving the 
coordination of numerous people in the planning and 
execution of illegal acts or in the pursuit of a legitimate 
objective by unlawful means (e.g., threatening a legiti-
mate business to get a stake in it).
An offense is transnational if:
 
■
It is committed in more than one state.
 
■
It is committed in one state, but a substantial part of 
 
■
its preparation, planning, direction, or control takes 
place in another state.
It is committed in one state, but involves an orga-
 
■
nized criminal group that engages in criminal activi-
ties in more than one state.
It is committed in one state, but has substantial ef-
 
■
fects in another state.92
Transnational organized crime involves continuous 
 
■
commitment by primary members, although individu-
als with specialized skills may be brought in as needed. 
Organized crime is usually structured along hierarchical 
lines—a chieftain supported by close advisers, lower 
subordinates, and so on.
Transnational organized crime has economic gain as its 
 
■
primary goal, although power and status may also be 
motivating factors. Economic gain is achieved through 
global supply of illegal goods and services, including 
drugs, sex slaves, arms, and pornography.
In addition to providing illegal material such as narcot-
 
■
ics, contemporary global syndicates engage in busing-
type crimes such as laundering illegal money through 
legitimate businesses, land fraud, and computer crime.
Transnational criminal syndicates employ predatory 
 
■
 tactics, such as intimidation, violence, and corruption.

presentation to the press in Mexico City, September 13, 2010. Before his capture, Barragan 
was a leader of the Beltran Leyva drug cartel. Despite setbacks such as this, the cartels 
continue to flourish and dominate the international drug trade. More than 28,000 people 
have been killed in Mexico in the past four years, many in drug-related incidents.

Transnational organized crime groups are quick and ef-
 
■
fective in controlling and disciplining their members, 
associates, and victims and will not hesitate to use lethal 
violence against those who fl out organizational rules.
Transnational crime depends heavily on the instru-
 
■
ments of the IT age: the Internet, global communica-
tions, rapid global transportation systems, the universal 
banking system, and global credit card and payment 
systems.
Transnational organized crime groups do not include 
 
■
terror organizations, though there may be overlap. 
Some terror groups are involved in criminality to fund 
their political objectives, and some have morphed 
from politically motivated organizations to ones solely 
involved in for-profi t criminal activity. Transnational 
criminal organizations may aid terror groups with trans-
portation and communication.
Origins of Organized Crime
Organized crime itself is not a recent phenomenon. In the 
1600s, London was terrorized by organized gangs that called 
themselves Hectors, Bugles, Dead Boys, and other colorful 
names. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Eng-
lish gang members wore distinctive belts and pins marked 
with serpents, animals, stars, and the like.93 The fi rst men-
tion of youth gangs in America occurred in the late 1780s, 
when prison reformers noted the presence of gangs of young 
people hanging out on Philadelphia’s street corners. By the 
1820s, New York’s Bowery and Five Points districts, Boston’s

North End and Fort Hill, and the outlying Southwark and 
Moyamensing sections of Philadelphia were the locales of 
youth gangs with colorful names like the Roach Guards, 
Chichesters, the Plug Uglies, and the Dead Rabbits.94
At the turn of the twentieth century, La Mano Nera (the 
Black Hand), an offshoot of Sicilian criminal groups, estab-
lished themselves in northeastern urban centers. Gangsters 
demanded payments from local businessmen in return for 
“protection”; those who would not pay were beaten and 
their shops vandalized. Eventually the Black Hand merged 
with gangs of Italian heritage to form larger urban-based 
gangs and groups.
A turning point in the development of organized gangs 
occurred on January 16, 1919, when the Eighteenth Amend-
ment to the U.S. Constitution was ratifi ed. The new amend-
ment prohibited the sale, manufacture, and transportation 
of intoxicating liquors. Until then, gangs had remained rela-
tively small and local, but now the national market for con-
trolled substances opened the door to riches. What emerged 
was a national syndicate, referred to as Cosa Nostra or the 
Mafia, that was centrally coordinated and whose various 
component gangs worked cooperatively to settle disputes, 
dictate policy, and assign territory.95 Despite efforts at coop-
eration and control, numerous and bloody gang wars and 
individual vendettas were common.
The Mafi a remains the largest organized crime group in 
the United States. Major families have a total membership of 
about 1,000 to 2,000 “made men,” who have been inducted 
into organized crime families, and another 17,000 “associ-
ates,” who are criminally involved with syndicate members. 
The families control crime in distinct geographic areas. New 
York City, the most important organized crime area, alone 
contains fi ve families—the Gambino, Columbo (formerly 
Profaci), Lucchese, Bonanno, and Genovese families—
named after their founding “godfathers.” In contrast, Chi-
cago contains a single mob organization called the “outfi t,” 
which also infl uences racketeering in such cities as Milwau-
kee, Kansas City, and Phoenix. The families are believed to 
be ruled by a “commission” made up of the heads of the fi ve 
New York families and bosses from Detroit, Buffalo, Chi-
cago, and Philadelphia, which settles personal problems and 
jurisdictional confl icts and enforces rules that allow mem-
bers to gain huge profi ts through the manufacture and sale 
of illegal goods and services.
The Mafia in Decline Joseph Massino’s nickname was 
“the Last Don.” The name seemed quite apropos when in 
2004 this boss of New York’s Bonanno crime family was con-
victed on charges of murder and racketeering, ordered to pay 
fi nes of $9 million, and given two consecutive life sentences. 
Massino’s greatest sin, however, may have been violating 
the Mafi a’s rule of omerta, the traditional “code of silence.” 
While in prison, Massino cooperated with prosecutors, se-
cretly taping a conversation with family capo Vincent “Vinnie 
Gorgeous” Basciano, who was outlining a plan to kill lead 
prosecutor Greg Andres. Massino’s circumstances were not 
unique. The heads of the four other New York Mafi a families 
were also convicted and sentenced to prison terms.96
The successful prosecution of Massino and other high-
ranking organized crime fi gures illustrates the decline of tra-
ditional organized crime groups. Law enforcement offi cials 
in Philadelphia, New Jersey, New England, New Orleans, 
Kansas City, Detroit, and Milwaukee all report that years 
of federal and state interventions have severely eroded the 
 Mafi a organizations in their areas.
What has caused this alleged erosion of Mafi a power? 
First, a number of the reigning family heads are quite old, in 
their 80s and older, prompting some law enforcement offi -
cials to dub them “the Geritol gang.”97 A younger generation 
of mob leaders stepped in to take control of the families, 
and they seem to have lacked the skill and leadership of the 
older bosses. In addition, active government enforcement 
policies have halved what the estimated mob membership 
was 25 years ago, and a number of the highest-ranking lead-
ers have been imprisoned.
The Mafi a was also hurt by changing values in U.S. soci-
ety. White, ethnic, inner-city neighborhoods, which were the 
locus of Mafi a power, have been shrinking as families move 
to the suburbs. Organized crime groups lost their urban-
centered political and social base of operations. In addition, 
the code of silence that protected Mafi a leaders is now bro-
ken regularly by younger members who turn informer rather 
than face prison terms. It is also possible that their success 
has hurt organized crime families: younger family members 
are better educated than their forebears and are equipped to 
seek their fortunes through legitimate enterprise.98
While traditional organized crime families may be 
shrinking in size, the demand for the services they provide 
remains constant. To fi ll the void, a new type of organized 
crime operation has developed—transnational organized 
crime. Based in Asia, eastern Europe, and North, South, 
and Latin America, this new breed of organized crime uses 
the Internet and other IT devices to facilitate their opera-
tions across nations and continents.
Activities of Transnational 
Organized Crime
What are the main activities of organized crime? The tradi-
tional sources of income are derived from providing illicit 
materials and using force to enter into and maximize profi ts 
in legitimate businesses. Most organized crime income comes 
from such activities as human traffi cking, narcotics distribu-
tion, illegal gambling, theft rings, Internet pornography, and 
cargo theft. The international trade in human traffi cking and 
prostitution is the subject of the Race, Culture, Gender, and 
Criminology feature “International Traffi cking in Persons.”
Contemporary organized crime cartels have also 
branched out into securities fraud. They target “small cap” 
or “micro cap” stocks, over-the-counter stocks, and other 
types of thinly traded stocks that can be easily manipulated

and sold to elderly or inexperienced investors. The conspir-
ators use offshore bank accounts to conceal their participa-
tion in the fraud scheme and to launder the illegal proceeds 
in order to avoid paying income tax.99
Contemporary Transnational 
Crime Groups
Emerging transnational crime syndicates are primarily 
located in nations whose governments are too weak to 
present effective opposition. If they believe that the gov-
ernment is poised to interfere with their illegal activities, 
they will carry out a terror campaign, killing police and 
other government officials to achieve their goals. Easier 
international travel, expanded world trade, and fi nancial 
transactions that cross national borders have enabled them 
to branch out of local and regional crime to target interna-
tional victims and develop criminal networks within more 
prosperous countries and regions.100 For example, Africa, 
a continent that has experienced political turmoil, has also 
seen the rise of transnational gangs. African criminal en-
terprises in Nigeria, Ghana, and Liberia have developed 
quickly since the 1980s due to the globalization of the 
world’s economies and the great advances in communica-
tion technology. Nigerian criminal enterprises, primarily 
engaged in drug traffi cking and fi nancial frauds, are the 
most signifi cant of these groups and operate in more than 
80 countries. They are infamous for their e-mail-based 
 fi nancial frauds, which cost the United States alone an esti-
mated $1 billion to $2 billion each year.
Some of the most prominent transnational gang clusters 
are described in some detail in the following sections.
Eastern European Gangs
Eastern gangs trace their origin to countries spanning the 
Baltics, the Balkans, central/eastern Europe, Russia, the 
Caucasus, and central Asia. For example, Albanian orga-
nized crime activities in the United States include gambling, 
money laundering, drug traffi cking, human smuggling, ex-
tortion, violent witness intimidation, robbery, attempted 
murder, and murder.101
Although ethnically based, these gangs work with other 
ethnic groups when perpetrating crimes. Trading in illegal 
arms, narcotics, pornography, and prostitution, they oper-
ate a multibillion-dollar transnational crime cartel. Balkan 
organized crime groups have recently expanded into more 
sophisticated crimes such as real estate fraud.
 Organized groups prey upon women in the poorest 
areas of Europe—Romania, the Ukraine, Bosnia—and sell 
them into sexual slavery. Many of these women are trans-
ported as prostitutes around the world, some fi nding them-
selves in the United States.
Russian Transnational Crime Groups 
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, criminal 
organizations in Russia and other former Soviet republics 
such as the Ukraine have engaged in a variety of crimes: 
drugs and arms traffi cking, stolen automobiles, traffi cking 
in women and children, and money laundering.102 No area 
of the world seems immune, certainly not the United States. 
America is the land of opportunity for unloading criminal 
goods and laundering dirty money.
Russian organized crime is not primarily based on eth-
nic or family structures. Instead, it is based on economic 
necessity that was nurtured by the oppressive Soviet regime. 
Here, a professional criminal class developed in Soviet pris-
ons during the Stalinist period that began in 1924—the era 
of the gulag. These criminals adopted behaviors, rules, val-
ues, and sanctions that bound them together in what was 
called the thieves’ world, led by the elite vory v zakone, crim-
inals who lived according to the “thieves’ law.” This thieves’ 
world, and particularly the vory, created and maintained the 
bonds and climate of trust necessary for carrying out orga-
nized crime.
Contemporary Patterns in Russian Organized 
Crime The following are some specifi c characteristics of 
Russian organized crime in the post-Soviet era:
Russian criminals make extensive use of the state 
 
■
governmental apparatus to protect and promote their 
criminal activities. For example, most businesses in 
Russia—legal, quasi-legal, and illegal—must operate 
with the protection of a krysha (roof). The protection is 
often provided by police or security offi cials employed 
outside their offi cial capacities for this purpose. In other 
cases, offi cials are “silent partners” in criminal enter-
prises that they, in turn, protect.
As Communism collapsed, the privatization of industry 
 
■
resulted in the massive use of state funds for criminal 
gain. Valuable properties are purchased through insider 
deals for much less than their true value and then re-
sold for lucrative profi ts.
Criminals have been able to directly infl uence the state’s 
 
■
domestic and foreign policy to promote the interests of 
organized crime, either by attaining public offi ce them-
selves or by buying public offi cials.
Beyond these particular features, organized crime in 
Russia shares other characteristics that are common to orga-
nized crime elsewhere in the world:
Systematic use of violence, including both the threat 
 
■
and use of force
Hierarchical structure
 
■
Limited or exclusive membership
 
■
Specialization in types of crime and a division of labor
 
■
Military-style discipline, with strict rules and regula-
 
■
tions for the organization as a whole

542  PART THREE | CRIME TYPOLOGIES
In the popular 2008 film Taken, Bryan 
Mills, a former CIA agent (played by Liam 
Neeson) uses his special combat skills 
to save his daughter Kim after she is ab-
ducted while on a trip to Paris. Almost as 
soon as she arrives in town, Kim and a 
friend are kidnapped, drugged, and forced 
into the slave trade by a gang of Albanian 
mobsters. As Bryan searches frantically 
for his beloved daughter, he uncovers a 
scheme, protected by corrupt police, in 
which young women are being kidnapped 
and sold into the sex trade. Because she is 
a virgin, Kim is spared prostitution: she is 
to be auctioned off to a millionaire wishing 
to buy a concubine for his personal use. 
In pursuit, Bryan Mills kills about 100 sex 
traffickers, saves his daughter in the nick 
of time, and returns her safely home to the 
United States.
Can these dreadful images be based 
on reality? While few fathers are like Bryan 
Mills, international sex trafficking is all too 
real. Every year, hundreds of thousands 
of women and children—primarily from 
Southeast Asia and eastern Europe—are 
lured by the promise of good jobs and then 
end up forced into brothels or as circuit 
travelers in labor camps. Most go to wealthy 
industrialized countries. Japan now has 
more than 10,000 commercial sex estab-
lishments with 150,000 to 200,000 foreign 
girls trafficked into the country each year. 
India has experienced a large influx of for-
eign sex workers who are believed to be the 
source of the HIV epidemic that is sweep-
ing the country.
It is believed that traffickers import up 
to 50,000 women and children every year 
into the United States despite legal prohibi-
tions (in addition to prostitution, some are 
brought in to work in sweatshops). Federal 
law defines trafficking as:
1.  sex trafficking in which a commercial 
sex act is induced by force, fraud, or co-
ercion, or in which the person induced 
to perform such an act has not attained 
18 years of age; or
2.  the recruitment, harboring, transporta-
tion, provision, or obtaining of a person 
for labor or services, through the use of 
force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose 
of subjection to involuntary servitude, 
peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.
Global trafficking gangs use force, 
fraud, or coercion to exploit a person for 
profit. Victims are subjected to labor and/
or sexual exploitation. Trafficking for labor 
exploitation, the form of trafficking claiming 
the greatest number of victims, includes 
traditional slavery, forced labor, and hold-
ing people in bondage until they can pay 
off debts. Trafficking for sexual exploita-
tion may include involvement in prostitu-
tion or pornographic films. The use of force 
or coercion can be direct and violent or 
psychological.
How great is the problem? The Interna-
tional Labor Organization (ILO)—the United 
Nations agency charged with addressing 
labor standards, employment, and social 
protection issues—estimates that there are 
at least 12 million adults and children in 
forced labor, bonded labor, and commercial 
sexual servitude at any given time. Of these 
victims, the ILO estimates that at least 1.39 
million, 56 percent female, are victims of 
commercial sexual servitude, both transna-
tional and within countries.
Human traffickers prey on the weak, 
targeting vulnerable men, women, and 
children. They use creative and ruthless 
ploys designed to trick, coerce, and win the 
confidence of potential victims. Very often 
these ruses involve promises of a better life 
through employment, educational opportu-
nities, or marriage. 
While films like Taken depict sex traf-
fickers as almost entirely men, the UN 
report found that sex traffickers are of-
ten women, many of whom began as sex 
workers themselves. They are encour-
aged by their recruiter/trafficker to return

home and recruit other women, often un-
der the scrutiny of people working for the 
trafficker to make sure they don’t try to 
escape.
Because it is a global enterprise, there 
is a great deal of cooperation in traffick-
ing, so that in eastern Europe a single gang 
may include Russians, Moldavians, Egyp-
tians, and Syrians. Cooperation allows sex 
slaves to be trafficked not only to neigh-
boring countries but all around the globe. 
The UN found that victims from East Asia 
were detected in more than 20 countries 
in regions throughout the world, including 
Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, 
Central Asia, and Africa.
Contributing Factors
Human trafficking is facilitated by social 
problems and disorder, such as disrup-
tions in the global economy, war, and so-
cial unrest. Economic crisis hits young girls 
especially hard. Female victims are often 
poor and aspire to a better life. They may 
be forced, coerced, deceived, and psy-
chologically manipulated into industrial or 
agricultural work, marriage, domestic servi-
tude, organ donation, or sexual exploitation. 
Some traffickers exploit victims’ frustration 
with low salaries in their home countries, 
while others prey upon a crisis in victims’ 
families that requires them to make money 
abroad. The traffickers then promise to take 
victims abroad and find them traditionally 
 female service sector jobs, such as waitress, 
salesperson, domestic worker, or au pair/
babysitter.
While victims often come from poorer 
countries, the market for labor and sex is 
found in wealthier countries or in countries 
that, while economically poor, cater to the 
needs of citizens from wealthy countries, of 
corporations, or of tourists.
Combating Trafficking
The United States has made stopping the 
trafficking of women a top priority. In 1998, 
the “Memorandum on Steps to Combat 
Violence Against Women and the Traffick-
ing of Women and Girls” was issued, which 
directed the secretary of state, the attorney 
general, and the president’s Interagency 
Council on Women to expand their work 
against violence against women to include 
work against the trafficking of women.
In the Russian Federation, prevention 
education projects are aimed at potential 
victims of trafficking, and nongovernmen-
tal organizations have established hotlines 
for victims or women seeking information 
about the risks of accepting job offers 
abroad.
The UN report found that the number of 
convictions for human trafficking is increas-
ing, especially in a handful of countries. 
Nonetheless, most countries’ conviction 
rates rarely exceed 1.5 per 100,000 peo-
ple, which is even below the level normally 
recorded for rare crimes like kidnapping. As 
of 2007–2008, two out of every five coun-
tries covered by the UNODC report had not 
recorded a single conviction for sex traffick-
ing, so the problem still remains.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. If put in charge, what would you do to 
slow or end the international sex trade? 
Before you answer, remember the say-
ing that prostitution is the oldest profes-
sion, which implies that curbing it may 
prove quite difficult.
 2. Should men who hire prostitutes who 
are obviously involved in the sex trade 
against their will be punished more 
severely in order to deter them from 
getting involved in the exploitation of 
these vulnerable young women? Or is it 
unfair to expect someone to know the 
reasons their sex partner was involved 
in prostitution?

operates both on its own and in cooperation with foreign 
groups. The latter cooperation often comes in the form of 
joint money laundering ventures. Russian criminals have 
become involved in killings for hire in central and western 
Europe, Israel, Canada, and the United States.
In the United States, thousands of Russian immigrants 
are believed to be involved in criminal activity, primarily in 
Russian enclaves in New York City.103 However, with the ex-
ception of extortion and money laundering, Russians have 
had little or no involvement in some of the more traditional 
types of organized crime, such as drug traffi cking, gambling, 
and loan sharking. Instead, Russian criminal groups are 
extensively engaged in a broad array of frauds and scams, 
including health care fraud, insurance scams, stock frauds, 
antiquities swindles, forgery, and fuel tax evasion schemes. 
Russians are believed to be the main purveyors of credit 
card fraud in the United States. Legitimate businesses, such 
as the movie business and textile industry, have become tar-
gets of criminals from the former Soviet Union, and they are 
often used for money laundering and extortion.

in the United States occurred in 1996 when Vyacheslav

States to act as the coordinating authority for all Russian or-
ganized crime activity in the U.S., was convicted on extor-
tion and conspiracy charges. Ivankov led an international 
criminal organization that operated mainly in New York, To-
ronto, London, Vienna, Budapest, and Moscow, but also in 
numerous other cities in the United States, Canada, and Eu-
rope, and specialized in extorting Russian business interests. 
While Ivankov’s conviction was a setback, Russian groups 
continue to thrive, engaging in Internet crimes, extortion, 
and white-collar crimes.
Latin American and Mexican 
Drug Cartels
Transnational crime cartels operate freely in South American 
nations such as Peru and Colombia. Caribbean nations such 
as Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti are the home 
to drug and gun smuggling gangs. The money infl ows from 
illicit trade strengthens and enlarges the gangs, enabling 
them to increase their involvement in intraregional and 
transnational dealing in order to gain more money. Further-
more, drug traffi cking has contributed to a sharp increase in 
the availability and usage of fi rearms.104
However, while island groups fl ourish, it is the Mexican 
drug cartels that are now of greatest concern. These transna-
tional gangs have become large-scale suppliers of narcotics, 
marijuana, and methamphetamines to the United States, and 
Mexico has become a drug producing and transit country. 
In addition, an estimated 90 percent of cocaine entering the 
United States transits Mexico. Mexican drug gangs routinely 
use violence, and fi ghting for control of the border regions 
has affected U.S. citizens: more than 60 Americans have 
been kidnapped, and Mexican drug cartel members have 
threatened to kill U.S. journalists covering drug violence in 
the border region. Although Mexican drug cartels, or drug 
traffi cking organizations, have existed for quite some time, 
they have become more powerful since Colombia was able 
to crack down on the Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. 
Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale illicit drug 
market in the United States. As a result, Mexican cartels are 
the leading wholesale launderers of drug money from the 
United States. Mexican and Colombian traffi cking organiza-
tions annually smuggle an estimated $8 billion to $25 billion 
in drug proceeds into Mexico for laundering.
There are numerous drug cartels operating in Mexico, 
the main ones being Gulf, Tijuana, Sinaloa, Juárez, Millen-
nium, Oaxaca, and Colima. Some are dominant in local 
regions, while the major gangs—Gulf, Sinaloa, and Juárez—
are present throughout all of Mexico. In recent years, new 
cartels have formed and others have become allies, in a con-
stantly shifting landscape of drug activity. The Tijuana cartel 
formed an alliance with the Gulf cartel and several cartels 
(Sinaloa, Juárez, and Valencia) have also formed an alliance 
known as “the Federation.” Originated in the 1980s, La 
Familia Michoacana cartel became an independent drug 
traffi cking organization and later allied itself with the Gulf 
cartel. La Familia’s leadership is philosophically opposed 
to the sale of methamphetamine to Mexicans, and instead 
supports its export to the United States for consumption 
by Americans. La Familia is a heavily armed cartel that has 
utilized violence to support its narcotics traffi cking busi-
ness, including murders, kidnappings, and assaults. Associ-
ates of La Familia based in the United States have acquired 
military-grade weapons, including assault weapons and am-
munition, and have arranged for them to be smuggled back 
into Mexico for use by La Familia. (See Figure 15.2 for a 
map of the cartels’ areas of infl uence.)
Asian Transnational Crime Groups
Asian-based transnational crime groups are also quite active 
in such areas as human traffi cking, narcotics, and money 
laundering.105 Chinese gangs are involved in importing 
heroin from the neighboring Golden Triangle area and dis-
tributing it throughout the country (see the Race, Culture, 
Gender, and Criminology feature “Drug Production and 
Traffi cking in the Golden Triangle”). They are also involved 
in gambling and prostitution, activities that had all but dis-
appeared under Mao Zedong’s Communist regime. The two 
leading organized crime problems in Cambodia are drug 
production/trafficking and human trafficking. Drug traf-
fi ckers also use Cambodia as a transit country and traffi c 
Cambodian women into Thailand for sexual activities. In 
Taiwan, the number one organized crime problem is heijin, 
the penetration of mobsters into the legitimate business sec-
tor and the political arena. Gangs are now heavily involved 
in the businesses of bid-rigging, waste disposal, construc-
tion, cable television networks, telecommunications, stock 
trading, and entertainment. Further, starting in the mid-
1980s, many criminals have successfully run for public of-
fi ce in order to protect themselves from police crackdowns. 
Taiwan gangs are also involved in gambling, prostitution, 
loan sharking, debt collection, extortion, and gang violence; 
kidnapping for ransom is also a serious concern. Among the 
best-known Asian crime groups are the following:
Yakuza.

multinational criminal activities, including human traf-

Controlling Transnational Crime
Efforts to control transnational organized crime are typically 
in the hands of federal agencies. One approach is to form 
international working groups to collect intelligence, share 
information, and plot unified strategies among member 
nations. The FBI belongs to several international working 
groups aimed at combating transnational gangs in various 
parts of the world. For example, to halt the infl uence and 
reach of Eurasian organized crime, the FBI is involved in the 
following groups and activities:
Eurasian Organized Crime Working Group.
 
■
 Established in 
1994, this group meets to discuss and jointly address 
the transnational aspects of Eurasian organized crime 
that impact member countries and the international 
community in general. The member countries are Can-
ada, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the 
United States, and Russia.
Central European Working Group.
 
■
 This group is part of a 
project that brings together the FBI and central Euro-
pean law enforcement agencies to discuss cooperative 
investigative matters covering the broad spectrum of 
Eurasian organized crime. A principal concern is the 
growing presence of Russian and other Eurasian orga-
nized criminals in central Europe and the United States. 
The initiative works on practical interaction between

operating in Toronto. Ma agreed to arrange 
the murder as a favor for the supplier 
and to strengthen their lucrative criminal 
partnership. Ma summoned several of his 
henchmen from southern California to 
New York City, briefed them on their mis-
sion, provided them with a photograph of 
and addresses for the intended victim, and 
then dispatched the hit team to Toronto to 
carry out the killing.
Ma gave Chen the task of preparing 
the hit team for the murders. One of Ma’s 
longest-serving followers, Chen dutifully 
traveled to Canada with the leader of the 
hit team to scout out where the intended 
victim lived and worked; went with the 
leader of the hit team to obtain guns for the 
murder; attempted to smuggle those guns 
across the Canadian border; and picked up 
members of the hit team from the airport, 
giving each of them $2,000 for their trip.
On July 20, 1994, two members of Ma’s 
hit team shot their way into a business office 
where the intended victim was supposed 
to be, and killed two innocent bystanders 
Kwan Kin Ming and Yip Pak Yin, neither of 
whom was involved in narcotics trafficking. 
The  intended victim escaped unharmed.
Ma and Chen’s criminal conspiracy 
shows the broad reach of transnational 
crime syndicates, ranging from Hong Kong 
to New York and Toronto.

The Chinese Connection
On February 16, 2010, Sui Min Ma, aka 
Frank Ma, the leader or dai lo of a Chinese 
organized crime group, was sentenced to 
life in prison for ordering the murder of two 
people in Toronto, Canada, in 1994. The 
murders, which had been under investi-
gation for more than 15 years, occurred 
when Ma along with his chief lieuten-
ant Bing Yi Chen, aka Ah Ngai, (who re-
ceived a 35-year sentence) engaged in a 
murder-for-hire conspiracy in connection 
with their group’s heroin trafficking ac-
tivities. It seems that from 1991 through 
1996, Ma, Chen, and their associates im-
ported millions of dollars’ worth of heroin 
from Asia and distributed it in New York 
City. In the summer of 1994, Ma’s princi-
pal heroin supplier in Hong Kong asked 
him to assassinate another drug dealer

nication and working relationships, to develop strate-
gies and tactics to address transnational organized crime 
matters impacting the region, and to identify potential 
common targets.
Southeast European Cooperative Initiative.
 
■
 This is an inter-
national organization intended to coordinate police and 
customs regional actions for preventing and combating 
transborder crime. It is headquartered in Bucharest, 
Romania, and has 12 fully participating member coun-
tries. The United States has been one of 14 countries 
with observer status since 1998. The initiative’s center 
serves as a clearinghouse for information and intel-
ligence sharing, allowing the quick exchange of infor-
mation in a professional and trustworthy environment. 
The initiative also supports specialized task forces for 
countering transborder crime such as the traffi cking of 
people, drugs, and cars; smuggling; fi nancial crimes; 
and terrorism.
In addition, U.S. law enforcement agencies have coop-
erated in cross-border operations to eradicate gang activity. 
These typically involve a multi-agency effort involving of-
fi cers from the DEA, FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection, U.S. Marshals Service, and ATF, as well as 
attorneys from the Criminal Division’s Narcotic and Danger-
ous Drug Section.107
Laws Against Organized Crime Congress has passed 
a number of laws that have made it easier for agencies to 
bring transnational gangs to justice. One of the fi rst mea-
sures aimed directly at organized crime was the Interstate 
and Foreign Travel or Transportation in Aid of Racketeer-
ing Enterprises Act (Travel Act).108 The Travel Act prohibits 
travel in interstate commerce or use of interstate facilities 
with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or 
facilitate an unlawful activity; it also prohibits the actual or 
attempted engagement in these activities.
In 1970, Congress passed the Organized Crime Control 
Act. Title IX of the act, probably its most effective measure, 
is the Racketeer Infl uenced and Corrupt Organization 
Act (RICO).109 RICO did not create new categories of 
crimes but rather new categories of offenses in racketeer-
ing activity, which it defi ned as involvement in two or more 
acts prohibited by 24 existing federal and 8 state statutes. 
The offenses listed in RICO include state-defi ned crimes, 
such as murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, 
bribery, extortion, and narcotic violations; and federally 
defi ned crimes, such as bribery, counterfeiting, transmis-
sion of gambling information, prostitution, and mail fraud. 
RICO is designed to limit patterns of organized criminal ac-
tivity by prohibiting involvement in acts intended to do the 
following:

CHAPTER 15 | Crimes of the New Millennium: Cybercrime and Transnational Organized Crime  547
The focal point of illicit drug production 
and trafficking in Southeast Asia is known 
as the Golden Triangle, a rugged, moun-
tainous region that overlaps the borders 
of Burma (Myanmar), Laos, and Thailand. 
Although the tri-border region accounts for 
the majority of heroin production in South-
east Asia, the amount of heroin produced 
in the area has decreased by approximately 
70 percent in the past five years. In 2004, 
Burma and Laos accounted for nearly all 
heroin produced in the region. Eradication 
efforts and the enforcement of poppy-free 
zones have combined to depress cultiva-
tion levels.
However, the decline in heroin produc-
tion is being offset by an increase in the 
production of amphetamine-type stimulants 
(ATS). Methamphetamine is cheaper and 
easier to produce than heroin; it entails a 
simple process that starts with ephedrine, 
the principal alkaloid of ephedra, a shrub 
that grows wild on vast expanses of the 
nearby Chinese province of Yunnan.
Much of the heroin produced in the 
Golden Triangle reaches markets through 
southern China, although increased law 
enforcement pressure by Chinese authori-
ties has forced some traffickers to seek 
new routes through Thailand. In Laos, the 
Mekong River is a major conduit for heroin 
trafficking and is patrolled in only a few ar-
eas. Many key drug areas, particularly in 
the north, are virtually inaccessible to Lao-
tian officials. According to Interpol, “eth-
nic Chinese traffickers control the heroin 
trade in Oceania (often with Vietnamese 
criminal organizations), Malaysia, and the 
few remaining markets in Canada and the 
United States.”
Hong Kong’s position as a key port city 
and its proximity to the Golden Triangle 
and mainland China have made it a natural 
transit point for heroin moving from South-
east Asia to global markets. Although the 
amount of heroin transiting through Hong 
Kong appears to be diminishing, drug 
traffickers continue to use it as a base of 
operations.

An individual convicted under RICO is subject to 
20 years in prison and a $25,000 fi ne. Additionally, the ac-
cused must forfeit to the U.S. government any interest in 
a business in violation of RICO. These penalties are much 
more potent than simple conviction and imprisonment.
Why Is It So difficult to Eradicate Transnational 
Gangs? While international cooperation is now common 
and law enforcement agencies are willing to work together 
to fi ght transnational gangs, these criminal organizations are 
extremely hard to eradicate. The gangs are ready to use vio-
lence and well equipped to carry out threats. It has proven 
diffi cult for law enforcement to combat the drug cartels be-
cause they employ enforcer gangs to protect them and intim-
idate enemies. For example, Mexico’s Gulf cartel has its own 
paramilitary force known as the Zetas, whose core members 
are alleged to be former members of the Mexican military’s 
elite Special Air Mobile Force Group (Grupo Aeromóvil de Fu-
erzas Especiales). Military trained, the Zetas are able to carry 
out complex operations and use sophisticated weaponry. Be-
lieved to number more than 200 fi ghters, the Zetas main-
tain the Gulf cartel’s regional domination. Recruiting from 
around Latin America, not only do the Zetas act as assassins 
for the Gulf cartel, they also traffi c arms, kidnap, and col-
lect payments for the cartel on its drug routes. In addition to 
defending the cartel’s terrain in northern Mexico, Zetas are 
believed to control traffi cking routes along the eastern half 
of the U.S.–Mexico border. And when they feel threatened, 
they are quite willing to fi ght the law even if it means cross-
ing the U.S. border to do so.110 Cross-border attacks help to 
quiet witnesses and intimidate local law enforcement agents.
Adding to control problems is the fact that the drug trade 
is an important source of foreign revenue, and destroying 
the drug trade undermines the economies of third-world 
nations. Even if the government of one nation were willing 
to cooperate in vigorous drug suppression efforts, suppli-
ers in other nations, eager to cash in on the sellers’ market, 
would be encouraged to turn more acreage over to coca or 
poppy production. Today, almost every Caribbean country 
is involved with narcotics traffi cking; illicit drug shipments 
in the region are worth more money than the top fi ve legiti-
mate exports combined. Drug gangs are able to corrupt the 
political structure and destabilize countries. Drug addiction 
and violent crime are now common in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, 
and even small islands like St. Kitts. The corruption of the 
police and other security forces has reached a crisis point, 
where an offi cer can earn the equivalent of half a year’s sal-
ary by simply looking the other way on a drug deal.111 There 
are also indications that the drug syndicates may be planting 
a higher yield variety of coca and improving refi ning tech-
niques to replace crops lost to government crackdowns.

The United States has little infl uence in some key drug-
producing areas such as Taliban-held Afghanistan and Myan-
mar (formerly Burma). War and terrorism also may make 
gang control strategies problematic. After the United States 
toppled Afghanistan’s Taliban government, the remnants 
began to grow and sell poppy to support their insurgency; 
Afghanistan now supplies 90 percent of the world’s opium.112 
And while the Colombian guerillas may not be interested in 
joining or colluding with crime cartels, they fi nance their 
war against the government by aiding drug traffi ckers and 
“taxing” crops and sales.113 Considering these problems, it is 
not surprising that transnational gangs continue to fl ourish.
 1. Be familiar with the concept 
of cybercrime
Cybercrime is a new breed of 
 
■
offenses that involve the theft 
and/or destruction of infor-
mation, resources, or funds 
utilizing computers, computer 
networks, and the Internet. Cy-
bercrime presents a challenge 
for the justice system because it 
is rapidly evolving, it is diffi cult 
to detect through traditional 
law enforcement channels, and 
its control demands that agents 
of the justice system develop 
technical skills that match those 
of the perpetrators. Cybercrime 
has grown because information 
technology (IT) has become 
part of daily life in most indus-
trialized societies.
 2. Know the basic forms cyber-
crime takes
Some cybercrimes use mod-
 
■
ern technology to accumulate 
goods and services (cybertheft). 
Cybervandalism involves mali-
cious attacks aimed at disrupt-
ing, defacing, and destroying 
technology that the attackers 
fi nd offensive. Cyberterrorism 
is aimed at undermining the 
social, economic, and political 
system of an enemy nation by 
destroying its electronic infra-
structure and disrupting its 
economy.
 3. Discuss the distribution of il-
licit materials via the Net
The Internet has become an 
 
■
important source for selling and 
distributing obscene material. 
While some sites cater to legal 
sexually related material, others 
SUMMARY
cross the legal border by ped-
dling access to obscene material 
or even kiddie porn. It is un-
likely that any law enforcement 
efforts will put a dent in the 
Internet porn industry. It is also 
possible to obtain drugs via the 
Net without a prescription or 
with bogus prescriptions.
 4. Be able to discuss the concept 
of stealing intellectual property
Warez refers illegally obtained 
 
■
software acquired by groups of 
individuals who work together 
to then “crack” or “rip” its 
copyright protections, before 
posting it on the Internet for 
other members of the group 
to use. Another type of illegal 
copyright infringement involves 
fi le-sharing programs that al-
low Internet users to download 
music and other copyrighted 
material without paying the art-
ists and record producers their 
rightful royalties.
 5. Know what is meant by the 
terms identity theft and phishing
Identity theft occurs when a 
 
■
person uses the Internet to 
steal someone’s identity and/
or impersonate the victim to 
open a new credit card ac-
count or conduct some other 
fi nancial transaction. Identity 
theft can destroy a person’s life 
by manipulating credit records 
or stealing from their bank ac-
counts. Phishing involves the 
creation of false e-mails and/
or websites that look legitimate 
but are designed to gain illegal 
access to a victim’s personal 
information. Vishing is a form 
of phishing utilizing Internet 
phone protocols.
 6. Be familiar with the different 
types of cybervandalism
Cybervandalism ranges from 
 
■
sending destructive viruses 
and worms to hacker attacks 
designed to destroy important 
computer networks. A com-
puter virus is one type of mali-
cious software program that 
disrupts or destroys existing 
programs and networks, caus-
ing them to perform the task for 
which the virus was designed. 
Computer worms are similar 
to viruses but use computer 
networks or the Internet to self-
replicate and send themselves 
to other users, generally via 
e-mail, without the aid of the 
operator. A Trojan horse looks 
like a benign application but 
contains illicit codes that can 
damage the system operations. 
A logic bomb is a program that 
is secretly attached to a com-
puter system, monitors the net-
work’s work output, and waits 
for a particular signal such as a 
date to appear.
 7. Understand the concept of 
cyberterrorism
Cyberterrorism can be viewed 
 
■
as an effort by covert forces to 
disrupt the intersection where 
the virtual electronic reality of 
computers meets the physical 
world. Some experts question 
the existence of cyberterrorism, 
going so far as to claim that 
not a single case of cyberter-
rorism has yet been recorded, 
that cybervandals and hackers

are regularly mistaken for ter-
rorists, and cyber defenses are 
more robust than is commonly 
supposed.
 8. Discuss efforts to control 
cybercrime
The growth of cybercrime and 
 
■
its cost to the economy have 
created the need for new laws 
and enforcement processes 
specifi cally aimed at controlling 
its new and emerging formu-
lations. Congress has treated 
computer-related crime as a 
distinct federal offense since 
passage of the Counterfeit Ac-
cess Device and Computer 
Fraud and Abuse Law in 1984. 
Because cybercrime is relatively 
new, existing laws sometimes 
are inadequate to address the 
problem. Therefore new leg-
islation has been drafted to 
protect the public from this 
new breed of criminal. Special-
ized enforcement agencies have 
been created to crack down on 
cybercriminals.
 9. Trace the evolution of organized 
crime
Organized criminals used to be 
 
■
white ethnics—Jews, Italians, 
and Irish—but today African 
Americans, Latinos, and other 
groups have become involved 
in organized crime activities. 
The old-line “families” are now 
more likely to use their criminal 
wealth and power to buy into 
legitimate businesses. The most 
common view of organized 
crime today is an ethnically di-
verse group of competing gangs 
dedicated to extortion or to pro-
viding illegal goods and services. 
Efforts to control organized 
crime have been stepped up by 
the federal government, which 
has used antiracketeering stat-
utes to arrest syndicate leaders.
 10. Be familiar with transnational 
organized crime
Organized crime today is trans-
 
■
national. With the aid of the 
Internet and instant commu-
nications, groups are operating 
on a global scale to traffi c drugs 
and people, to launder money, 
and to sell arms. Eastern Euro-
pean crime families are active 
abroad and in the United States. 
Russian organized crime has be-
come a major problem for law 
enforcement agencies. Mexican 
and Latin American groups are 
quite active in the drug trade; 
Asian crime families are in-
volved in smuggling and other 
illegal activities.

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
 1. Which theories of criminal behav-
ior best explain the actions of cy-
bercriminals, and which ones do 
you believe fail to explain 
cybercrime?
 2. How would you punish a web 
page defacer who placed an 
antiwar message on a government 
site? Prison? Fine?
 3. What guidelines would you rec-
ommend for the use of IT in law 
enforcement?
 4. Are we creating a “Big Brother” 
society and is the loss of 
personal privacy worth the price 
of safety?
 5. What can be done to reduce the 
threat of transnational organized 
crime?

The text’s fi nal section reviews the agencies and the process of criminal justice, 
the agencies of the law designed to exert social control over criminal offenders. 
Chapter 16 provides an overview of the justice system and describes its major 
institutions and processes. Chapter 17 reviews the investigation, arrest, and trial 
process, while Chapter 18 examines punishment, sentencing, and correction. 
There is a great deal of controversy over the nature and purpose of justice. 
Some view the goal of justice as social control, while others view it as a mecha-
nism of redemption and restoration. Consequently, a major objective of poli-
cymakers is to formulate and disseminate effective models of crime prevention 
and control. Efforts are now being undertaken at all levels of the justice system 
to improve information fl ow, experiment with new program concepts, and eval-
uate current operating procedures. The purpose of this section is to introduce the agencies 
of justice and describe their organization and operations, the legal controls placed on their 
activities, and the obstacles they face in dispensing fair and even-handed justice.

In 2010, four California women—Jean Crump, Faye Shilling, Barbara Ann Lynn, and Lydia Eileen Pearce—were 
convicted in an insurance fraud scam that was as ingenious as it was cold-blooded.1 The women had entered 
into a scheme to defraud insurance companies by fi ling $1.2 million in phony life insurance policy claims. Each 
member of the fraud ring brought her own expertise to the table. Crump and Pearce worked at a mortuary and 
knew all there was to know about funerals and death documents. Lab tech Shilling knew the ins and outs of 
fi ling insurance claims, and notary Lynn used her stamp to make the fake documents look legitimate.
In one instance, Crump and/or her co-schemers purchased life insurance policies for a nonexistent man, 
“Jim Davis,” naming his equally fi ctitious nephew and niece as benefi ciaries. Soon after they took out the policy, 
Mr. Davis had an untimely demise, and the conspirators created false documents, including a death certifi cate

556  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
John Wesley Hardin is alleged to have killed at least 30 
men, studied law in prison, and became a practicing at-
torney before his death! Henry McCarty, better known as 
“Billy the Kid,” participated in range wars and may have 
killed more than 20 people before being gunned down in 
1881 by Sheriff Pat Garrett (who was shot and killed in 
1908 in the aftermath of an argument over ranch land). 
The most notorious of them all was the outlaw Jesse James, 
guerilla fi ghter, gang leader, and bank robber; his story is 
set out in the Profiles in Crime feature. Opposing them 
were famous lawmen such as Wyatt Earp, James “Wild 
Bill” Hickok, and William “Bat” Masterson (who became a 
sports columnist in New York after hanging up his guns).
The West was not alone in producing outlaws and des-
perados. Eastern cities were controlled by gangs that had 
formed before the Civil War in urban slums. In the Five 
Points and Bowery neighborhoods in New York City, the 
Plug Uglies, the Hudson Dusters, and the Dead Rabbits en-
gaged in mayhem, murder, and extortion. These gangs were 
the forerunners of the organized crime families that devel-
oped in New York and then spread to Philadelphia, Chicago, 
New Orleans, and other major urban areas.
The southern states also had their share of crime and 
terror. After the war, nightriders and the Ku Klux Klan were 
active in the South, using vigilante methods to maintain the 
status quo and terrorize former slaves. The violence spilled 
over into bloody local feuds in the hill country of south-
ern Appalachia. Factional hatreds, magnifi ed by the lack of 
formal law enforcement and grinding poverty, gave rise to 
violent attacks and family feuding.
Not surprisingly, the emergence of criminal gangs and 
groups in the nineteenth century prompted the develop-
ment of formal agencies of criminal justice. In 1829, the 
with a doctor’s forged signature, to collect his life insurance. They also prepared grossly infl ated bills from a 
mortuary to cover the man’s funeral and burial costs and wired the bills to two different assignment companies 
that advance money to mortuaries while the estate and insurance claims are being settled. The assignment 
companies paid the mortuary almost $50,000, and the money went right into the hands of the conspirators. 
And an insurance company paid out more than $230,000 in life insurance to Mr. Davis’s “nephew.”
To cover up their deeds, the conspirators actually bought a burial plot for Mr. Davis and conducted 
a mock funeral. The funeral was attended by several phony family members recruited to play the part of 
mourners in case anyone was watching.
When the insurance companies making the payouts became suspicious, they began an investigation 
that unnerved the con artists so much that they had the coffi n supposedly holding the remains of Jim Davis 
unearthed. They fi lled the casket with a mannequin and cow parts to ensure the proper weight and sent it to 
a crematory. Then they fi led phony paperwork stating that he had been cremated and had his ashes scattered 
over the Pacifi c Ocean. At this point, the Feds became involved, and the scheme was quickly uncovered, the 
women were arrested and convicted.
D
Dealing with wily insurance fraud schemes is but one of the 
ongoing problems faced by the agencies of the justice sys-
tem: the police, the courts, and correctional agencies. The 
public relies on the agencies of the criminal justice system 
to provide solutions to the crime problem and to shape the 
direction of crime policy. This loosely organized collection 
of agencies is charged with, among other matters, maintain-
ing social control, protecting the public, preventing crime, 
preserving order, enforcing the law, identifying transgressors, 
bringing the guilty to justice, treating criminal behavior, and 
administering justice in a fair and even-handed manner.
This chapter serves as an introduction to the criminal jus-
tice system. It begins with some background information on 
the history and formation of the agencies of justice. It then 
covers the agencies of justice and the justice process and dif-
ferent visions of what constitutes criminal justice. Because 
no single view exists of the underlying goals that help shape 
criminal justice, the varying perspectives on what criminal 
justice really is or should be are set out in some detail.
ORIGINS OF THE AMERICAN 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Crime is not a new phenomenon. Chapter 2 noted the rise 
in crime rates during the mid-nineteenth century. After the 
Civil War, former Union and Confederate soldiers headed 
west with the dream of prospecting or farming. Some be-
came notorious gunmen who preyed upon the newcomers.

to St. Joseph, Missouri, in 1881 and lived 
quietly under the alias Thomas Howard. On 
April 3, 1882, while dusting a picture frame, 
he was shot in the back of the head by Bob 
Ford, a fellow gang member. Ford, forever 
known as “the dirty little coward who shot 
Mr. Howard,” did the deed in order to claim 
a $5,000 reward.
Legend aside, James was in fact more 
of an impulsive killer than a latter-day Robin 
Hood. His rise to fame began in 1863, when 
at age 16 he joined his brother Frank in a 
band of pro-Confederate guerillas operating 
in the contested borderlands of Kansas and 
Missouri. These guerilla fighters, known as 
bushwhackers, ambushed Union militias 
and assassinated civilians believed to be 
Union sympathizers. The James brothers 
eventually joined up with the notorious Wil-
liam Quantrill, a ruthless raider whose gue-
rilla band savaged Unionists, killing people 
indiscriminately, burning homes, and de-
stroying entire towns. On the morning of 
August 21, 1863, they attacked Lawrence, 
Kansas, burnt the town, and killed 183 
men and boys. In September 1864, Jesse 
and Frank, now riding with Bloody Bill An-
derson, held up a train in the town of Cen-
tralia and helped to kill 22 unarmed Union 
soldiers on board.
After the war, Jesse James used the 
guerilla tactics he had learned during his 
bushwhacker days to stage robberies and 
murders. He carried out what is believed 
to have been the first daylight robbery of 
a bank in America, escaping from Liberty, 
Missouri, with $58,000 in 1866. Until his 
death in 1882, Jesse James left a long trail 
of dead lawmen, bank tellers, and railroad 
personnel. His exploits became fodder for a 
newly emerging media that used him as a 
symbol of southern resistance to the postwar 
political order. James didn’t mind the pub-
licity or the identification. On July 21, 1873, 
his gang wore Ku Klux Klan masks when 
they derailed the Rock Island train in Adair, 
Iowa, and stole approximately $3,000.
Even though he died more than 100 
years ago, the legend of Jesse James lives 
on. (He was played by Brad Pitt in a 2007 
film, The Assassination of Jesse James by 
the Coward Robert Ford.) But James was 
no hero. His history of antisocial acts began 
in his youth and persisted into his adult-
hood, ending only in his premature death.

The Outlaw Jesse James
There is no more storied bad man in the his-
tory of America than the outlaw Jesse James. 
A true folk hero, James has been portrayed 
in books and films as a southern gentleman 
who took money from the rich and gave it 
to the needy. Loved by the “little people,”

fi rst police agency, the London Metropolitan Police, was de-
veloped to keep the peace and identify criminal suspects. In 
the United States, police agencies began to appear during 
the mid-nineteenth century. The penitentiary, or prison, was 
created to provide nonphysical correctional treatment for 
convicted offenders; these were considered “liberal” innova-
tions that replaced corporal or capital punishment.
Although significant and far-reaching, these changes 
were rather isolated developments. As criminal justice devel-
oped over the next century, these fl edgling agencies of justice 
rarely worked together in a systematic fashion. It was not 
until 1919—when the Chicago Crime Commission, a pro-
fessional association funded by private contributions, was 
created—that the work of the criminal justice system began 
to be recognized.2 This organization acted as a citizens’ ad-
vocate group and kept track of the activities of local justice 
agencies. The commission still carries out its work today.
In 1931, President Herbert Hoover appointed the Na-
tional Commission of Law Observance and Enforcement, 
commonly known today as the Wickersham Commission. 
This national study group analyzed the American justice 
system in detail and helped usher in the era of treatment 
and rehabilitation. It showed the complex rules and regula-
tions that governed the system and exposed how diffi cult 
it was for justice personnel to keep track of the legal and 
administrative complexity.
The modern era of criminal justice study began with a 
series of explorations of the criminal justice process con-
ducted under the auspices of the American Bar Foundation.3
As a group, the foundation studies brought to light some of 
the hidden or low-visibility processes that are at the heart of 
justice system operations. They showed how informal deci-
sion making and the use of personal discretion are essential 
ingredients of the justice process.

justice. Rather than viewing police, courts, and correctional

WHAT IS THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM?
The term criminal justice system refers to the components of 
government charged with enforcing law, adjudicating crimi-
nals, and correcting criminal conduct. The criminal justice 
system is essentially an instrument of social control: society 
considers some behaviors so dangerous and destructive that 
it either strictly controls their occurrence or outlaws them 
outright. It is the job of the agencies of justice to prevent 
social harm and to dispense formal social control by ap-
prehending and punishing those who violate the law and 
in so doing deter those who may be contemplating future 
wrongdoing. Although society maintains other institutions 
of informal social control—such as the family, school, and 
church—these are designed to deal with moral, not legal, 
misbehavior. Under the rule of law, it is only the agencies of 
the criminal justice system that have the power to formally 
punish people who break the law by depriving them of free-
dom or even taking their life.
The major components of this immense system are de-
scribed in Figure 16.1.
The contemporary criminal justice system is monumen-
tal in size. It now costs federal, state, and local governments 
more than $200 billion per year for civil and criminal jus-
tice, up more than 500 percent since 1982 (Figure 16.2).
Per capita expenditure across the three government types 
and criminal justice functions is now more than $720 each 
year for every American! One reason the justice system is so 
expensive to run is because it employs more than 2.4 mil-
lion people in thousands of independent law enforcement, 
court-related, and correctional agencies. The nation now has 
This 1890s photograph shows members of the London Metropolitan 
Police taking a criminal into custody. By the turn of the twentieth 
century, uniformed police were common in large cities in the United 
States and England.

Another milestone occurred in 1967, when the Presi-
dent’s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Admin-
istration of Justice (the Crime Commission), appointed by 
President Lyndon Johnson, published its fi nal report, The 
Challenge of Crime in a Free Society.4 This group of practitio-
ners, educators, and attorneys had been charged with cre-
ating a comprehensive view of the criminal justice process 
and offering recommendations for its reform. Its efforts re-
sulted in passage of the Safe Streets and Crime Control Act 
of 1968, which provided federal funds for state and local 
crime control efforts. This legislation helped launch a mas-
sive campaign to restructure the justice system by funding 
the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), 
an agency that provided hundreds of millions of dollars in 
aid to local and state justice agencies. Federal intervention 
through the LEAA ushered in a new era in research and de-
velopment in criminal justice and established the concept 
that its component agencies actually make up a system.5
Though the LEAA is no longer in operation, its efforts 
helped identify the concept of a unifi ed system of criminal

Police departments are those public 
agencies created to maintain order, 
enforce the criminal law, provide 
emergency services, keep traffic on 
streets and highways moving freely, 
and develop a sense of community 
safety. Police officers work actively 
with the community to prevent crim-
inal behavior; they help divert mem-
bers of special needs populations, 
such as juveniles, alcoholics, and 
drug addicts, from the criminal justice 
system; they participate in specialized 
units such as a drug prevention task 
force or antirape unit; they cooperate 
with public prosecutors to initiate 
investigations into organized crime 
and drug trafficking; they resolve 
neighborhood and family conflicts; 
and they provide emergency services, 
such as preserving civil order during 
strikes and political demonstrations.
The criminal courthouse is the scene
of the trial process. Here the criminal 
responsibility of defendants accused of 
violating the law is determined. Ideally, 
the court is expected to convict and 
sentence those found guilty of crimes 
while ensuring that the innocent are 
freed without any consequence or 
burden. The court system is formally 
required to seek the truth, to obtain 
justice for the individual brought before 
its tribunals, and to maintain the integ-
rity of the government’s rule of law. The 
main actors in the court process are 
the judge, whose responsibilities in-
clude overseeing the legality of the trial 
process, and the prosecutor and the 
defense attorney, who are the oppo-
nents in what is known as the adver-
sary system. These two parties oppose 
each other in a hotly disputed contest
—the criminal trial—in accordance with 
rules of law and procedure. 
In the broadest sense, correctional 
agencies include community super-
vision or probation, various types of 
incarceration (including jails, houses 
of correction, and state prisons), and 
parole programs for both juvenile and 
adult offenders. These programs 
range from the lowest security, such 
as probation in the community with 
minimum supervision, to the highest 
security, such as 24-hour lockdown 
in an ultra-maximum security prison. 
Corrections ordinarily represent the 
postadjudicatory care given to of- 
fenders when a sentence is imposed 
by the court and the offender is 
placed in the hands of the correc-
tional agency.

560  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
THE PROCESS OF JUSTICE
In addition to viewing the criminal justice system as a col-
lection of agencies, it is possible to see it as a series of de-
cision points through which offenders flow. This process, 
illustrated in Figure 16.3, begins with initial contact with po-
lice and ends with the offender’s reentry into society. At any 
point in the process, a decision may be made to drop further 
proceedings and allow the accused back into society without 
additional penalty. To justice expert Herbert Packer, this pro-
cess is similar to an assembly line conveyor belt, down which 
moves an endless stream of cases, never stopping.10 Accord-
ing to this view, each of the stages of justice is actually a de-
cision point in which cases are removed from the system or 
continued on the journey to formal resolution with a convic-
tion and sentencing. For example, at the investigatory stage, 
police must decide whether to pursue the case or terminate 
involvement because there is insuffi cient evidence to identify 
a suspect, the case is considered trivial, the victim decides 
not to press charges, and so on. At the bail stage, a decision 
must be made whether to set bail so high that the defendant 
remains in custody, to set a reasonable bail, or to release the 
defendant on his or her own recognizance without requiring 
any bail at all. Each of these decisions can have a critical ef-
fect on the defendant, the justice system, and society. If an 
error is made, an innocent person may suffer or a dangerous 
individual may be released to continue to prey upon society.
Although each jurisdiction is somewhat different, a 
comprehensive view of the processing of a felony offender 
would probably contain the following decision points:
 1. Initial contact. In most instances, an offender’s initial 
contact with the criminal justice system takes place as a 
result of a police action:
Patrol offi cers observe a person acting suspiciously, 
 
■
conclude the suspect is under the infl uence of 
drugs, and take her into custody.
almost 18,000 law enforcement agencies, including more 
than 12,500 local police departments, 3,000 county sheriffs’ 
offi ces, and 49 state police departments (every state has one 
except Hawaii). In addition, there are 2,000 other specialized 
law enforcement agencies ranging from transit police in large 
cities to county constables. These police and law enforcement 
agencies employ more than 1 million people, including more 
than 700,000 sworn personnel (those with general arrest pow-
ers) and the rest civilian employees. Of these, about 600,000 
are in local agencies, 330,000 work in county sheriffs’ of-
fi ces, and the rest (90,000) work for state police.6 There are 
nearly 17,000 courts; more than 8,000 prosecutorial agencies 
employ around 80,000 people; and about 1,200 correctional 
institutions (such as jails, prisons, and detention centers) em-
ploy around half a million people. There are also thousands of 
community corrections agencies, including more than 3,500 
probation and parole departments (see Exhibit 16.1).
The system is massive because it must process, treat, 
and care for millions of people. Although the crime rate has 
declined substantially in the past decade, almost 14 million 
people are still being arrested each year, including more than 
2 million for serious felony offenses.7 In addition, the juve-
nile courts handle about 1.5 million juveniles. Today, state 
and federal courts convict a combined total of over 1 mil-
lion adults on felony charges.8 It is not surprising, consider-
ing these numbers, that today more than 7 million people 
are under some form of correctional supervision, including 
2 million men and women in the nation’s jails and prisons 
and an additional 5 million adult men and women being 
supervised in the community while on probation or parole. 
More people are being convicted today than ever before and, 
if sent to prison or jail, serve more of their sentence behind 
bars.9 The cost of corrections is now about $68 billion per 
year, a cost of about $30,000 per inmate, reinforcing the old 
saying, “It costs a lot more to put a person in the state pen 
than to send a student to Penn State.”

 Court-ordered community supervision of 
convicted offenders by a probation agency. While on 
probation, offenders are required to obey specific rules of 
conduct in the community.
Prison.

A state or federal correctional facility that houses 
convicted criminals who have been sentenced to a period 
of confinement that is typically more than one year.
Jail.

A county correctional facility that holds people pend-
ing trial, awaiting sentencing, serving a sentence that is 
usually less than one year, or awaiting transfer to other 
facilities after conviction.
Parole. 
 
■
Community supervision after a period of 
incarceration.
In addition to the criminal justice system, there is also 
a juvenile justice system that apprehends, adjudicates, and 
corrects minors who violate the law. This system is set out in 
the Policy and Practice in Criminology feature “The Juvenile 
Justice System in the New Millennium.”
The latest data on the criminal justice system can 
be found at the Bureau of Justice Statistics, whose 
mission is “to collect, analyze, publish, and disseminate 
information on crime, criminal offenders, victims of 
crime, and the operation of justice systems at all levels 
of government.” For more information, visit the Criminal

series of cases—the most important being In 
re Gault—it granted procedural and due pro-
cess rights, such as the right to legal counsel, 
to juveniles at trial. The Court recognized that 
many youths were receiving long sentences 
without the benefit of counsel and other Fifth 
and Sixth Amendment rights and that many 
institutions did not carry out their treatment 
role. Consequently, the juvenile justice pro-
cess became similar to the adult process.
In the 1970s, recognizing the stigma 
placed on youths by the delinquency la-
bel, efforts were made to remove or divert 
youths from the official justice process and 
place them in alternative, community-based 
treatment programs. One state, Massachu-
setts, went so far as to close its secure cor-
rectional facilities and place all youths, no 
matter how serious their crimes, in commu-
nity programs. Today the juvenile court is 
a vast enterprise, handling nearly 2 million 
delinquency cases each year and conduct-
ing over 1 million formal hearings.
Concern over juvenile violence has 
caused some critics to question the ju-
venile justice system’s treatment philoso-
phy. Some states have created mandatory 
waiver laws making it easier to try serious 
juvenile offenders in the adult system. The 
general trend has been to remove as many 
nonviolent and status offenders as possible 
from secure placements in juvenile insti-
tutions and at the same time to lengthen 
the sentences of serious offenders or to 
move such offenders to the adult system. 
Each year thousands of kids are waived to 
the adult system to face long prison sen-
tences. A recent report of the Campaign for 
Youth Justice, a group dedicated to ending 
the placement of youths in adult facilities, 
Independent of but interrelated with the 
adult criminal justice system, the juvenile 
justice system is primarily responsible for 
dealing with juveniles who commit crimes 
(delinquents) and those who are incorri-
gible, truants, runaways, or unmanageable 
(status offenders).
The policy of treating juveniles who com-
mit criminal acts separately from adults is 
relatively new. Until the late nineteenth cen-
tury, youthful criminals were tried in adult 
courts and punished in adult institutions. 
However, nineteenth-century reformers, 
today known as “child savers,” lobbied to 
separate young offenders from serious adult 
criminals. Their efforts were rewarded when 
the first separate juvenile court was set up 
in Chicago in 1899. Over the next 20 years, 
most other states created separate juvenile 
court and correctional systems.
At first, the juvenile system was based 
on the philosophy of parens patriae. This 
meant that the state was acting in the best 
interests of children in trouble who could 
not care for themselves. Under the parens 
patriae doctrine, delinquents and status 
offenders (sometimes called “wayward mi-
nors” or “children in need of supervision,” 
these youths are truants, runaways, or 
simply beyond control of parental author-
ity) were tried in an informal juvenile court 
hearing without the benefit of counsel or 
other procedural rights. The juvenile correc-
tional system, designed for treatment rather 
than punishment, was usually located in 
small institutions referred to as schools or 
camps. (The first juvenile reform school 
was opened in 1847 in Massachusetts.) Af-
ter the separate juvenile justice system was 
developed, almost all incarcerated youths 
were maintained in separate juvenile insti-
tutions that stressed individualized treat-
ment, education, and counseling.
Critics charged that the juvenile justice 
system’s reliance on informal procedure of-
ten violated a child’s constitutional rights to 
due process of law. It seemed unfair to place 
a minor child, tried without benefit of an attor-
ney or other legal safeguards granted to adult 
defendants, in a remote incarceration facility. 
In the 1960s, the Supreme Court revolution-
ized the juvenile justice system when, in a

its supposed deterrent value, there is little 
evidence that kids who are waived are less 
likely to commit serious crime.
Though some political figures consider 
the juvenile justice system a failure and 
want to embrace a “get tough” position, 
many people still believe that kids can be 
“saved.” Daniel Mears and his associates 
have found that a great majority of the gen-
eral public retain belief in the rehabilitative 
purpose of the juvenile court. This vision is 
supported by recent trends in juvenile in-
carceration. The number of incarcerated 
adolescents has actually declined during 
the past decade from over 100,000 in 2000 
to about 86,000 today, a trend that reflects 
both the decline in juvenile crime and an in-
creased reliance on community treatment. 
Some of the similarities and differences 
between the adult and juvenile justice 
systems are listed in Exhibit 16-A. Though 
there are many similarities between rights 
and privileges in both systems, there are 
some important differences. Juveniles can 
be taken into custody and placed in an in-
stitution for acts (status offenses) made il-
legal because of their age, such as being 
truant from school or running away from 
home. They do not have the right to a jury 
trial, and juvenile hearings are still closed 
to the public. However, juveniles who are 
waived to the adult court can be incarcer-
ated in prisons and even subject to the 
death penalty. These differences reflect the 
effort to protect adolescents from the stigma 
of a criminal label. Note how juveniles are 
never arrested or convicted; they are taken 
into custody and adjudicated.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Do you believe that children who commit 
serious crimes should be tried in adult 
courts and sent to adult prisons? If so, 
why do we need a juvenile justice system?
 2. Is it fair to place kids who repeatedly run 
away from home in the same facilities 
as kids who steal cars? Is it possible that 
both groups of offenders are motivated 
by the same types of personal problems 
and therefore deserve similar treatments?

found that on an average day 7,500 young 
people are held in adult facilities in the 
United States, and the yearly rate may be 
several times higher, resulting in the jail-
ing of tens of thousands of young people. 
Although some youths transferred to adult 
court never spend a day in an adult prison, 
thousands do, and many of them become 
enmeshed in the daily life of an adult cor-
rectional facility. They miss out on being 
housed in juvenile facilities that are smaller, 
have much lower inmate-to-staff ratios, 
and place greater emphasis on treatment, 
counseling, education, and mentoring of 
inmates. Though some adult facilities do 
provide easy access to education and treat-
ment, young inmates lose out on developing 
the relatively more supportive, mentoring-
focused style of staff–inmate interactions 
that a juvenile facility provides. And despite

564  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
allows suspects to have their lawyers present when po-
lice conduct in-custody interrogations.
 5. Complaint/charging. After police turn the evidence in a 
case over to the prosecutor, who represents the state 
at any criminal proceedings, a decision will be made 
whether to fi le a complaint, information, or bill of in-
dictment with the court having jurisdiction over the 
case. Complaints are used in misdemeanors; informa-
tion and indictment are employed in felonies. Each is 
a charging document asking the court to bring a case 
forward to be tried.
 6. Preliminary hearing/grand jury. Because it is a tremendous 
personal and fi nancial burden to stand trial for a seri-
ous felony crime, the U.S. Constitution provides that the 
state must fi rst prove to an impartial hearing board that 
there is probable cause that the accused committed the 
crime and, therefore, that there is suffi cient reason to try 
the person as charged. In about half the states and in the 
federal system, the decision of whether to bring a sus-
pect to trial (indictment) is made by a group of citizens 
brought together to form a grand jury that considers 
the case in a closed hearing, in which only the prosecu-
tor presents evidence.
   
In the remaining states, a charging document called 
“an information” is fi led before an impartial lower court 
judge, who decides whether the case should go forward. 
This is known as a preliminary hearing or probable 
cause hearing. The defendant may appear at a pre-
liminary hearing and dispute the prosecutor’s charges. 
During either procedure, if the prosecution’s evidence is 
accepted as factual and suffi cient, the suspect is called to 
stand trial for the crime. These procedures are not used 
for misdemeanors because of their lesser importance 
and seriousness.
 7. Arraignment. An arraignment brings the accused be-
fore the court that will actually try the case. The formal 
charges are read, and defendants are informed of their 
constitutional rights (such as the right to legal counsel). 
Bail is considered, and a trial date is set.
 8. Bail or detention. If the bail decision has not been consid-
ered previously, it is evaluated at arraignment. Bail is a 
money bond, the amount of which is set by judicial au-
thority; it is intended to ensure the presence of suspects 
at trial while allowing them their freedom until that time. 
Suspects who do not show up for trial forfeit their bail. 
Suspects who cannot afford bail or whose cases are so 
serious that a judge refuses them bail (usually restricted 
to capital cases) must remain in detention until trial. 
In most instances, this means an extended stay in the 
county jail. Many jurisdictions allow defendants awaiting 
trial to be released on their own recognizance, without 
bail, if they are stable members of the community.
 9. Plea bargaining. After arraignment, it is common for 
the prosecutor to meet with the defendant and his or 
her attorney to discuss a possible plea bargain. If plea 
A person walks into the police station and con-
 
■
fesses a crime—for example, he killed his wife 
after an altercation.
Initial contact can also be initiated by citizens, 
for example, when a parent fi les a petition in juve-
nile court alleging that his child is beyond control 
and needs to be placed in a state detention facility.
 2. Investigation. Regardless of whether the police observe, 
hear of, or receive a complaint about a crime, they may 
investigate to gather sufficient facts, or evidence, to 
identify the perpetrator, justify an arrest, and bring the 
offender to trial. An investigation may take a few min-
utes, as when patrol offi cers see a burglary in progress 
and apprehend the burglar at the scene of the crime. 
An investigation may also take years to complete and 
involve numerous investigators. Dennis Rader, the no-
torious BTK (bind, torture, kill) serial killer, began his 
murderous streak in 1974 and was fi nally apprehended 
in 2005 after an investigation that lasted more than 
20 years.11
 3. Arrest. An arrest occurs when the police take a person 
into custody for allegedly committing a criminal act. An 
arrest is legal when all of the following conditions exist: 
(a) the offi cer believes there is suffi cient evidence (prob-
able cause) that a crime is being or has been committed 
and that the suspect committed the crime; (b) the offi cer 
deprives the individual of freedom; and (c) the suspect be-
lieves that he or she is in the custody of a police offi cer and 
cannot voluntarily leave. The police offi cer is not required 
to use the word “arrest” or any similar word to initiate an 
arrest, nor does the offi cer fi rst have to bring the suspect to 
the police station. For all practical purposes, a person who 
has been deprived of liberty is under arrest. Arrests can be 
made at the scene of a crime or after a warrant is issued 
by a magistrate. Under most circumstances, to make an 
arrest in a misdemeanor, the offi cer must have witnessed 
the crime personally, known as the in-presence require-
ment. However, some jurisdictions have waived the in-
presence requirement in specifi c classes of crimes, such as 
domestic violence offenses, enabling police offi cers to take 
formal action after the crime has been committed. Arrests 
can also be made when a magistrate, presented with suffi -
cient evidence by police and prosecutors, issues a warrant 
authorizing the arrest of the suspect.
 4. Custody. After arrest, the suspect remains in police cus-
tody. The person may be taken to the police station to be 
fi ngerprinted and photographed and to have personal 
information recorded—a procedure popularly referred 
to as booking. Witnesses may be brought in to view the 
suspect (in a lineup), and further evidence may be gath-
ered on the case. Suspects may undergo interrogation 
by police offi cers to get their side of the story, they may 
be asked to sign a confession of guilt, or they may be 
asked to identify others involved in the crime. The law

14. Release. At the end of the correctional sentence, the of-
fender is released into the community. Most incarcerated 
offenders are granted parole before the expiration of the 
maximum term given them by the court and therefore 
fi nish their prison sentences in the community under 
supervision of the parole department. Offenders sen-
tenced to community supervision, if successful, simply 
fi nish their terms and resume their lives unsupervised 
by court authorities.
15. Postrelease/aftercare. After termination of correctional 
treatment, the offender must successfully return to the 
community. This adjustment is usually aided by cor-
rections department staff members, who attempt to 
counsel the offender through the period of re-entry 
into society. The offender may be asked to spend some 
time in a community correctional center, which acts 
as a bridge between a secure treatment facility and ab-
solute freedom. Offenders may fi nd that their convic-
tion has cost them some personal privileges, such as 
the right to hold certain kinds of jobs. These privileges 
may be returned by court order once the offenders 
have proven their trustworthiness and willingness to 
adjust to society’s rules. Successful completion of the 
postrelease period marks the end of the criminal jus-
tice process.
bargaining is successful, the ac-
cused pleads guilty as charged, 
thus ending the criminal trial pro-
cess. In return for the plea, the 
prosecutor may reduce charges, 
request a lenient sentence, or 
grant the defendant some other 
consideration.
 10. Trial/adjudication. If a plea bargain 
cannot be arranged, a criminal 
trial takes place. This involves a 
full-scale inquiry into the facts of 
the case before a judge, a jury, or 
both. The defendant can be found 
guilty or not guilty, or the jury can 
fail to reach a decision (hung jury), 
thereby leaving the case unresolved 
and open for a possible retrial.
 11. Disposition. After a criminal trial, a 
defendant who is found guilty as 
charged is sentenced by the pre-
siding judge. Disposition usually 
involves a fine, a term of com-
munity supervision (probation), a 
period of incarceration in a penal 
institution, or some combination 
of these penalties. In the most se-
rious capital cases, it is possible 
to sentence the offender to death. 
Dispositions are usually made af-
ter a presentencing investigation is conducted by the 
court’s probation staff. After disposition, the defendant 
may appeal the conviction to a higher court.
12. Postconviction remedies. After conviction, if the defendant 
believes he or she was not treated fairly by the justice 
system, the individual may appeal the conviction. An 
appellate court reviews trial procedures in order to de-
termine whether an error was made. It considers such 
questions as whether evidence was used properly, the 
judge conducted the trial in an approved fashion, the 
jury was representative, and the attorneys in the case 
acted appropriately. If the court rules that the appeal has 
merit, it can hold that the defendant be given a new trial 
or, in some instances, order his or her outright release. 
Outright release can be ordered when the state prose-
cuted the case in violation of the double jeopardy clause 
of the U.S. Constitution or when it violated the defen-
dant’s right to a speedy trial.
13. Correctional treatment. Offenders who are found guilty 
and are formally sentenced come under the jurisdic-
tion of correctional authorities. They may serve a term 
of community supervision under control of the county 
probation department, they may have a term in a com-
munity correctional center, or they may be incarcerated 
in a large penal institution.
In some jurisdictions, arraignments have gone high-tech and defendants do not have to be 
in court to be arraigned. Here, Tina Page (seated right) is arraigned by videoconference for 
a misdemeanor in front of Kanawha County Magistrate Jeanie Moore (left screen) without 
having to leave the South Central Regional Jail in Charleston, West Virginia. Assisting Page is 
Corrections Officer C. D. Fleming (left position on right screen) and First Sergeant R. E. Rogers

566  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
However, many other cases are dismissed at each stage of the 
process—investigation, arrest, charging, grand jury, trial—
so that relatively few cases actually go through the entire 
formal justice process.12 Despite all the slippage, more than 
1 million people are still being convicted on felony charges 
each year, and about 700,000 receive some form of correc-
tional treatment.
Concept Summary 16.1 shows the interrelationship of 
the component agencies of the criminal justice system and 
the criminal justice process.
Celebrity Cases Public perceptions about criminal justice 
are often formed on the basis of what happens in a few cel-
ebrated cases that receive widespread media attention. Some 
involve wealthy clients who can afford to be represented by 
high-powered attorneys and who can hire the best experts 
to convince the jury that their client is innocent. The O. J. 
Simpson case is probably the best example of the celebrity 
defendant. Other defendants become celebrities when they 
are accused of particularly heinous or notorious crimes and 
draw the attention of both the press and accomplished de-
fense attorneys. Serial killers such as David Berkowitz, aka 
Son of Sam, celebrity murderers such as Mark David Chap-
man, killer of John Lennon, and Preppie Murder Case slayer 
Robert Chambers make up this second category of criminal.
In reality, these celebrity cases are few and far between. 
Most defendants are indigent people who cannot afford a 
comprehensive defense. The system is actually dominated 
Going Through the Justice Process
At every stage of the criminal justice process, a decision is 
made by an agency of criminal justice whether to send the 
case further down the line or “kick it” from the system. For 
example, an investigation is pursued for a few days, and if a 
suspect is not identifi ed, the case is dropped. A prosecutor 
decides not to charge a person in police custody because 
he or she believes there is insuffi cient evidence to sustain a 
fi nding of guilt. A grand jury fails to hand down an indict-
ment because it fi nds that the prosecutor presented insuf-
fi cient evidence. A jury fails to convict the accused because 
it doubts his or her guilt. A parole board decides to release 
one inmate but denies another’s request for early release.
These decisions transform the identity of the individual 
passing through the system from an accused to a defendant, 
convicted criminal, inmate, and ex-con. Conversely, if de-
cision makers take no action, people accused of crime can 
return to their daily lives with minimal interference in their 
lives or identities. Their friends and neighbors may not even 
know that they were once the subject of criminal investiga-
tion. Decision making and discretion mark each stage of 
the system.
Thus, the criminal justice system screens out a great ma-
jority of cases before trial. Figure 16.4 shows the outcome of 
felony cases arraigned in the nations’ largest counties. About 
half of all defendants who reach arraignment are eventu-
ally incarcerated in prison or jail, most after pleading guilty.

CHAPTER 16 | Criminal Justice: Process and Perspectives  567
Supreme Court became more active in the affairs of the jus-
tice system. Today, each component of the justice system is 
closely supervised by state and federal courts through the law 
of criminal procedure, which sets out and guarantees citizens 
certain rights and privileges when they are accused of crime.
Procedural laws control the actions of the agencies of 
justice and defi ne the rights of criminal defendants. They 
fi rst come into play when people are suspected of commit-
ting crimes, and the police wish to investigate them, search 
their property, or interrogate them. Here the law dictates, for 
example, whether police can search the homes of or inter-
rogate unwilling suspects. If a formal charge is fi led, pro-
cedural laws guide pretrial and trial activities; for example, 
they determine when and if people can obtain state-fi nanced 
attorneys (right to counsel) and when they can be released 
on bail. If a person is found guilty of committing a criminal 
offense, procedural laws guide the posttrial and correctional 
processes; for example, they determine when a conviction 
can be appealed.
Procedural laws have several different sources. Most im-
portant are the fi rst ten amendments to the U.S. Constitu-
tion, ratifi ed in 1791 and generally called the Bill of Rights. 
Included within these amendments are the rights of people 
to be secure in their homes from unwarranted intrusion by 
government agents, to be free from self-incrimination, and 
to be protected against cruel punishments, such as torture.
The guarantees of freedom contained in the Bill of Rights 
initially applied only to the federal government and did not 
affect the individual states. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amend-
ment made the first ten amendments to the Constitution 
binding on state governments. However, it has remained the 
duty of state and federal court systems to interpret consti-
tutional law and to develop a body of case law that spells 
out the exact procedural rights to which a person is entitled. 
Thus, it is the U.S. Supreme Court that interprets the Con-
stitution and sets out the procedural laws that must be fol-
lowed by the lower federal and state courts. If the Supreme 
Court has not ruled on a procedural issue, then the lower 
courts are free to interpret the Constitution as they see fi t.
Today, procedural rights protect defendants from illegal 
searches and seizures and overly aggressive police interro-
gations. According to the exclusionary rule, such illegally 
seized evidence cannot be used during a trial.
CONCEPTS OF JUSTICE
Many justice system operations are controlled by the rule of 
law, but they are also infl uenced by the various philosophies 
or viewpoints held by its practitioners and policymakers. 
These, in turn, have been infl uenced by criminological the-
ory and research. Knowledge about crime, its causes, and its 
control has signifi cantly affected perceptions of how crimi-
nal justice should be managed.
by judges, prosecutors, and public defenders who work in 
concert to get cases processed quickly and effi ciently. Trials 
are rare; most cases are handled with a quick plea bargain 
and sentencing. This pattern of cooperation is referred to 
as the courtroom work group. By working together in a 
cooperative fashion, the prosecution and defense make sure 
that the cases fl owing through the justice system proceed 
in an orderly and effective manner. Such “bargain justice” 
is estimated to occur in more than 90 percent of all crimi-
nal cases. If each defendant were afforded the full measure 
of constitutional rights, including a jury trial, the system 
would quickly become overloaded. Court dockets are too 
crowded and funds too scarce to grant each defendant a 
full share of justice.13 Although the criminal court system is 
founded on the concept of equality before the law, poor and 
wealthy citizens receive unquestionably different treatment 
when they are accused of crimes.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND 
THE RULE OF LAW
For many years, U.S. courts exercised little control over the 
operations of criminal justice agencies, believing that their ac-
tions were not an area of judicial concern. This policy is re-
ferred to as the hands-off doctrine. However, in the 1960s,

568  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
The crime control philosophy has become a dominant 
force in American justice. Surveys conducted by renowned 
criminal justice scholars James Unnever and Francis Cul-
len fi nd that the crime control philosophy has held sway for 
nearly 40 years, with the result being a prison population 
of more than 2 million. Rather than embrace a worldview 
that crime can be controlled through social programs and 
offenders treated on an individual basis, the general public 
has embraced harsh punishment as a means of protecting 
innocent individuals from being unnecessarily victimized. 
Conservative ideas on public policy, they note, have moved 
the United States from a center-left to a center-right nation.16
Why has this view predominated for so long? Since 1960, 
fear of crime has been coupled with a growing skepticism 
about the effectiveness of rehabilitation. A number of im-
portant reviews claimed that treatment and rehabilitation ef-
forts directed at known criminals just did not work.17 There 
is evidence that most criminals recidivate after their release 
from prison and that their re-entry into society can desta-
bilize the neighborhoods to which they return. The chang-
ing social climate that became more conservative during the 
Ronald Reagan era (1980 to 1988) helped make crime con-
trol an American institution. Criminals were looked upon 
as dangerous, antisocial people who had to be segregated, 
not as unfortunate victims of a cruel society. There was a 
corresponding growth in the private security and risk man-
agement industries.18 Because of America’s two-decade long 
imprisonment boom, more than 500,000 inmates are now 
being released back into the community each year. The lack 
of clear evidence that criminals can be successfully treated 
has produced a climate in which conservative, hard-line so-
lutions are being sought. The results of this swing can be 
seen in such phenomena as the use of the death penalty, 
erosion of the exclusionary rule, prison overcrowding, and 
attacks on the insanity defense. In the past few years, a num-
ber of states have changed their juvenile codes, making it 
easier to try juveniles as adults. Other states have expanded 
their control over ex-offenders—for example, requiring reg-
istration of sex offenders.
Can such measures deter crime? Crime control advo-
cates are quick to suggest that as the prison population has 
boomed, crime rates have declined.19 Though liberals may 
not like it, crime control advocates gloat over the decade-
long decline in the crime rate that has followed reinstate-
ment of the death penalty, longer prison sentences, and 
more cops on the street. The Profi les in Crime feature “Two 
Wrongs Don’t Make a Right” illustrates this approach to de-
terring serious criminal offenses.
Equal Justice Model
At its core, the equal justice model asserts that all people 
should receive the same treatment under the law. Efforts to 
distinguish between criminal offenders and create a system 
of individualized treatment creates a sense of unfairness that 
Not surprisingly, many competing views of justice ex-
ist simultaneously in U.S. culture. Those in favor of one 
position or another try to win public opinion to their side, 
hoping to infl uence legislative, judicial, or administrative 
decision making. Over the years, different philosophical 
viewpoints tend to predominate, only to fall into disfavor 
as programs based on their principles fail to prove effective. 
The remainder of this chapter briefl y discusses the most im-
portant concepts of criminal justice.
Crime Control Model
Those espousing the crime control model believe that the 
overriding purpose of the justice system is to protect the 
public, deter criminal behavior, and incapacitate known 
criminals. Those who embrace its principles view the justice 
system as a barrier between destructive criminal elements 
and conventional society. Speedy, effi cient justice—unen-
cumbered by legal red tape and followed by punishment 
designed to fit the crime—is the goal of advocates of the 
crime control model. Its disciples promote such policies 
as increasing the size of police forces, maximizing the use 
of discretion, building more prisons, using the death pen-
alty, and reducing legal controls on the justice system. They 
point to evidence showing that several hundred thousand 
criminals go free every year in cases dropped because police 
believe they have violated the suspects’ Miranda rights.14
They lobby for abolition of the exclusionary rule and ap-
plaud when the Supreme Court hands down rulings that 
increase police power.
The crime control philosophy emphasizes protecting so-
ciety and compensating victims. The criminal is responsible 
for his or her actions, has broken faith with society, and has 
chosen to violate the law for reasons such as anger, greed, or 
revenge. Therefore, money spent should be directed not at 
making criminals more comfortable but at increasing the ef-
fi ciency of police in apprehending them, the courts in effec-
tively trying them, and the corrections system in punishing 
them. Punishment is critical because it symbolizes the legiti-
mate social order and the power societies have to regulate 
behavior and punish those who break social rules.15
The crime control model is rooted in choice theory, 
discussed in Chapter 4. Fear of criminal sanctions 
is viewed as the primary deterrent to crime. Because 
criminals are rational and choose to commit crime, it 
stands to reason that their activities can be controlled 
if the costs of crime become too high. Swift, sure, and 
effi cient justice is considered an essential element of an 
orderly society.

CHAPTER 16 | Criminal Justice: Process and Perspectives  569
Unbeknownst to all involved, law en-
forcement agents had already identified 
Monzon and Boatwright as suspects in the 
airport robbery and were closely monitoring 
the pair. FBI agents who were listening to 
phone conversations found out about the 
kidnapping when they intercepted ransom 
calls from the kidnappers to Karls Monzon. 
They also heard evidence that Monzon in-
tended to shoot the kidnappers rather than 
pay a ransom. At that point, agents arrested 
Monzon, his wife, Cinnamon Monzon, and 
Brinks security guard Ornelio Diaz for their 
role in the airport robbery. The FBI, U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 
and the Miami-Dade Police Department 
continued to trace the kidnappers, eventu-
ally locating and rescuing Boatwright, who 
had been bound in duct tape and left in the 
back of a car parked in the garage of the 
Miami Princess Hotel.
During the rescue, agents arrested three 
of the kidnappers: Sanfiel, Del Regato, and 
Palacio. Michael Hernandez escaped that 
evening but was later arrested after he was 
identified by the other participants as the 
ringleader of the kidnapping plot. Robert 
Salty was ultimately charged separately 
for his role in the kidnapping plot after he 
turned himself in to authorities.
After trial, Hernandez and Palacio were 
convicted of their role in the kidnapping of 
Jeffrey Boatwright, and were sentenced to 
34 and 26.5 years in prison, respectively. 
Guillermo Del Regato got 31 years and 
Michael Sanfiel 27 years. On October 23, 
2006, Robert Salty was also sentenced to 
7 years imprisonment for his role in the 
kidnapping. The robbers did not escape 
punishment either. Jeffrey Boatwright and 
Karls Monzon each got 17 years imprison-
ment and Ornelio Diaz got 16 years. Cinna-
mon Monzon was sentenced to 2 years and 
9 months for her role as an accessory after 
the fact. Sometimes crime does not pay 
even when your target is a criminal!

Two Wrongs Don’t Make a Right
Like truth, some crimes seem stranger than 
fiction. That adage fits the tale of the 2005 
Brinks Robbery at the Miami International 
Airport, which netted the thieves millions in 
cash.
The plot began when Jeffrey Boat-
wright, his brother-in-law Karls Monzon, 
and others participated in the armed rob-
bery of $7.4 million from a cash shipment 
arriving at Miami International Airport from 
Frankfurt, Germany. Though the thieves 
got away, their troubles were just begin-
ning. In February 2006, another criminal, 
Michael “Shorty” Hernandez, learned who 
had committed the robbery and organized 
a plot to kidnap Jeffrey Boatwright and steal 
the money. He discovered Boatwright’s 
whereabouts through a local Miami jeweler 
named Robert Salty. On February 16, 2006, 
after Salty agreed to provide Boatwright’s lo-
cation in exchange for $50,000, Hernandez 
recruited Manuel Palacio, Michael Sanfiel, 
and Guillermo Del Regato to commit the 
armed kidnapping of Boatwright from the 
parking lot of a local Miami strip club.
Profiles in Crime
Profiles in Crime
undermines the goals of the system. Frustration arises when 
two people commit the same crime but receive different 
sentences or punishments. The resulting anger and a sense 
of unfairness will increase the likelihood of recidivism.
To remedy this situation, the criminal justice system 
must reduce discretion and unequal treatment. Each crimi-
nal act must be treated independently and punished pro-
portionately. Punishment must not be based on past events 
for which people have already paid their debt to society or 
on what they may do in the future because forthcoming 
behavior cannot be accurately predicted. The treatment of 
criminal offenders must be based solely on present behav-
ior: punishment must be equitably administered and based 
on what people deserve for their crimes; this is the principle 
of just deserts.
The equal justice perspective has had considerable in-
fl uence in molding the  nation’s sentencing policy. An ongo-
ing effort has been made to reduce discretion and guarantee 
that every offender convicted of a particular crime receives 
equal and precisely computed punishment. This change 
has been particularly welcome given the charges of racial 
discrimination that have beset the sentencing process. A 
number of initiatives have been designed to achieve this re-
sult, including mandatory sentences requiring that all peo-
ple convicted of a crime receive the same prison sentence. 
Truth-in-sentencing laws require offenders to serve a sub-
stantial portion of their prison sentence behind bars, thus 
limiting their eligibility for early release on parole.20
Due Process Model
In The Limits of the Criminal Sanction, Herbert Packer con-
trasted the crime control model with an opposing view that 
he referred to as the due process model.21 According to 
Packer, the due process model combines elements of liberal/
positivist criminology with the legal concept of procedural 
fairness for the accused. Those who adhere to due process 
principles believe in individualized justice, treatment, and 
rehabilitation of offenders. If discretion exists in the crimi-
nal justice system, it should be used to evaluate the treat-
ment needs of offenders. Most important, the civil rights of

570  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
criminology, the rehabilitation school suggests that people 
commit crimes through no fault of their own. Instead, crimi-
nals themselves are the victims of social injustice, poverty, and 
racism; their acts are a response to a society that has betrayed 
them. And because of their disturbed and impoverished up-
bringing, they may be suffering psychological problems and 
personality disturbances that further enhance their crime-
committing capabilities. Although the general public wants 
protection from crime, the argument goes, it also favors 
programs designed to help unfortunate people who commit 
crime because of emotional or social problems.26
Dealing effectively with crime requires attacking its root 
causes. Funds must be devoted to equalizing access to con-
ventional means of success. This requires supporting such 
programs as public assistance, educational opportunity, 
and job training. If individuals run afoul of the law, efforts 
should be made to treat them, not punish them, by empha-
sizing counseling and psychological care in community-
based treatment programs. Whenever possible, offenders 
should be placed on probation in halfway houses or in other 
rehabilitation-oriented programs.
This view of the justice system portrays it as a method 
for dispensing “treatment” to needy “patients.” Also known 
as the medical model, it portrays offenders as people who, 
because they have failed to exercise self-control, need the 
help of the state. The medical model rejects the crime con-
trol philosophy on the grounds that it ignores the needs of 
offenders, who are people whom society has failed to help.
Research evidence suggests that correctional treatment 
can have an important infl uence on offenders.27 Programs 
that teach interpersonal skills and use individual counseling 
and behavioral modifi cation techniques have produced pos-
itive results both in the community and within correctional 
institutions.28 And while some politicians call for a strict 
law-and-order approach, the general public is supportive 
of treatment programs such as early childhood intervention 
and services for at-risk children.29
Nonintervention Model
Both the rehabilitation ideal and the due process movement 
have been viewed suspiciously by experts concerned by the 
stigmatization and labeling of offenders. Regardless of the 
purpose, the more the government intervenes in the lives of 
people, the greater the harm done to their future behavior 
patterns. Once arrested and labeled, the offender is placed at 
a disadvantage at home, at school, and in the job market.30 
Rather than deter crime, the stigma of a criminal label erodes 
social capital and jeopardizes future success and achievement.
The nonintervention model calls for limiting govern-
ment intrusion into people’s lives, especially minors who 
run afoul of the law.31 Noninterventionists advocate deinsti-
tutionalization of nonserious offenders, diversion from for-
mal court processes into informal treatment programs, and 
decriminalization of nonserious offenses, such as possessing 
the accused should be protected at all costs. This emphasis 
calls for strict scrutiny of police search and interrogation 
procedures, review of sentencing policies, and development 
of prisoners’ rights.
Advocates of the due process model have demanded that 
competent defense counsel, jury trials, and other procedural 
safeguards be offered to every criminal defendant. They have 
also called for making public the operations of the justice sys-
tem and placing controls over its discretionary power.
Due process advocates see themselves as protectors of 
civil rights. They view overzealous police as violators of ba-
sic constitutional rights. Similarly, they are skeptical about 
the intentions of meddling social workers, whose treatments 
often entail greater confi nement and penalties than does pun-
ishment. Their concern is magnifi ed by data showing that the 
poor and minority group members are often maltreated in the 
criminal justice system. For example, Mark Mauer and Ryan 
King note that even today African Americans are incarcerated 
at nearly six (5.6) times the rate of whites and that Hispanics 
are incarcerated at nearly double (1.8) the rate of whites.22
Due process exists to protect citizens—both from those 
who wish to punish them and from those who wish to treat 
them without regard for legal and civil rights. Due process 
model advocates worry about the government’s expand-
ing ability to use computers to intrude into people’s private 
lives. They are troubled by computerized registry of sex of-
fenders, biometric identifi cation systems, mug shots, and 
fi ngerprint systems. These measures can endanger privacy 
and civil liberties, although research shows that they may 
have relatively little impact on controlling crime.23
Advocates of the due process orientation are quick to 
point out that the justice system remains an adversary pro-
cess that pits the forces of an all-powerful state against those 
of a solitary individual accused of crime. If an overriding 
concern for justice and fairness did not exist, the defendant 
who lacked resources could easily be overwhelmed and he 
or she would face the threat of wrongful conviction. This 
burden can be quite onerous. In April 2007, Jerry Miller of 
Chicago became the 200th person offi cially exonerated by 
DNA analysis since 1989. He spent 26 years in prison for 
a rape he did not commit. He is not the last person to be 
falsely convicted. Research sponsored by the Pew Founda-
tion found that a majority of death penalty convictions have 
been overturned due to “serious, reversible error,” including 
egregiously incompetent defense counsel, suppression of 
exculpatory evidence, false confessions, racial manipulation 
of the jury, “snitch” and accomplice testimony, and faulty 
jury instructions.24 Certainly the danger of convicting an in-
nocent person still remains a frightening possibility.25
Rehabilitation Model
The rehabilitation model embraces the notion that, given 
the proper care and treatment, criminals can be changed into 
productive, law-abiding citizens. Influenced by positivist

CHAPTER 16 | Criminal Justice: Process and Perspectives  571
You have been contacted by the president’s drug 
czar, who is in charge of coordinating the nation’s 
drug control policy. She has asked you to develop 
a plan to reduce drug abuse by 25 percent within 
three years.
You realize that multiple perspectives of jus-
tice exist and that the agencies of the criminal 
justice system can use a number of strate-
gies to reduce drug trafficking and the use of 
drugs. It might be possible to control the drug 
trade through a strict crime control effort—for example, using law 
enforcement officers to cut off supplies of drugs by destroying 
crops and arresting members of drug cartels in drug-producing 
countries. Border patrols and military personnel using sophisti-
cated hardware could also help prevent drugs from entering the 
country. According to the equal justice model, if drug violations 
were punished with criminal sentences commensurate with their 
harm, then the rational drug trafficker might look for a new line of 
employment. The adoption of mandatory 
sentences for drug crimes to ensure that 
all offenders receive similar punishment 
for their acts might reduce crime. The re-
habilitation model suggests that strategies 
should be aimed at reducing the desire to 
use drugs and increasing incentives for us-
ers to eliminate substance abuse. A nonin-
tervention strategy calls for the legalization 
of drugs so distribution could be controlled 
by the government. Crime rates would be 
cut because drug users would no longer need the same cash flow 
to support their habit.

small amounts of marijuana. Under 
this concept, the justice system should 
interact as little as possible with of-
fenders (see the Thinking Like a 
Criminologist feature). Police, courts, 
and correctional agencies would con-
centrate their efforts on diverting law 
violators out of the formal justice sys-
tem, thereby helping them avoid the 
stigma of formal labels such as delin-
quent or ex-con. Programs instituted 
under this model include mediation 
(instead of trial), diversion (instead of 
formal processing), and community-
based corrections (instead of secure 
corrections).
Nonintervention advocates are also 
skeptical about the creation of laws 
that criminalize acts that were previ-
ously legal, thus expanding the reach 
of justice and creating new classes of 
offenders. For example, it has become 
popular to expand control over youth-
ful offenders by passing local curfew 
laws that make it a crime for young 
people to be out at night after a cer-
tain hour, such as 11 P.M. An adoles-
cent who was formerly a night owl is now a criminal!32
There are many examples of nonintervention ideas 
in practice. For example, the juvenile justice system has 
made a major effort to remove youths from adult jails and 
reduce the use of pretrial detention. Mediation programs 
have proven successful alternatives to the formal trial pro-
cess. In the adult system, pretrial release programs (alterna-
tives to bail) are now the norm instead of an experimental

From the rehabilitation model perspective, even the most hardened criminal may be helped by 
effective institutional treatment plans and services. Here, prison inmate Stephanie Walker works 
with her Labrador Retriever puppy Gage during guide dog training at Metro State Prison in 
Atlanta, Georgia. The IMPACT program (Inmates Providing Animal Care and Training) teams 
inmates with puppies provided by Southeastern Guide Dog, Inc. for a 16-month program of 
training with a volunteer obedience instructor. The Georgia Department of Corrections then 
returns the dogs for advanced training, ultimately providing guide dogs to the visually impaired.

innovation. And, although the prison population is rising, 
probation and community treatment have become the most 
common forms of criminal sanction.
There has also been criticism of the nonintervention 
philosophy. There is little evidence that alternative programs 
actually reduce recidivism rates. Some critics charge that al-
ternative programs actually result in “widening the net.”33 
That is, efforts to remove people from the justice system ac-
tually enmesh them further within it by ordering them to 
spend more time in treatment than they would have had to 
spend in the formal legal process.
In the future, the nonintervention philosophy will be 
aided by the rising cost of justice. Although low-impact, 
nonintrusive programs may work no better than prison, 
they are certainly cheaper; program costs may receive greater 
consideration than program effectiveness.
Restorative Justice Model
Those who believe in the restorative justice model main-
tain that the true purpose of the criminal justice system is to 
promote a peaceful, just society; they advocate peacemak-
ing, not punishment.34
Advocates of restorative justice say that the violent pun-
ishing acts of the state are not dissimilar from the violent 
acts of individuals.35 Whereas crime control advocates as-
sociate lower crime rates with increased punishment, re-
storative justice advocates counter that studies show that 
punitive methods of correction (such as jail and prison) 
are no more effective than more humanitarian efforts (such 
as probation with treatment).36 Therefore, mutual aid 
rather than coercive punishment is the key to a harmoni-
ous society. Without the capacity to restore damaged social 
relations, society’s response to crime has been almost exclu-
sively punitive.
Although restorative justice has become an important 
perspective in recent years, with many diverse programs 
calling themselves restorative, there is no single defi nition 
of what constitutes restorative justice.37 Restorative justice 
programs must also be wary of the cultural and social differ-
ences that can be found throughout our heterogeneous so-
ciety; what may be considered restorative in one subculture 
may be considered insulting and damaging in another.38

So, despite the demand for punishing serious, chronic 
offenders, the door to treatment for nonviolent, non-
chronic offenders has not been closed. The number of 
noninterventionist and restorative justice programs featur-
ing restitution and nonpunitive sanctions is growing. As 
the cost of justice skyrockets and the correctional system 
becomes increasingly overcrowded, alternatives such as 
house arrest, electronic monitoring, intensive probation 
supervision, and other cost-effective programs have come 
to the forefront.

sentences and swelling prison populations.
Advocates of the rehabilitation model claim that the re-
cent imprisonment binge may be a false panacea.39 Crime 
may be dropping for reasons totally unrelated to incarcer-
ation—for example, the downturn in drug use, especially 
crack cocaine. In the long run, punitive models of justice 
are doomed to fail because most offenders re-enter society 
and any chance of success they have has been severely di-
minished by their prison experiences.

formal criminal justice system 
until the nineteenth century 
when the fi rst police agencies 
were created. The term criminal 
justice system became prominent 
in the United States around 
1967, when the President’s 
Commission on Law Enforce-
ment and the Administration 
of Justice began a nationwide 
study of the nation’s crime 
problem. Criminal justice is 
a fi eld that uses knowledge 
from various disciplines in an 
attempt to understand what 
causes people to commit crimes 
and how to deal with the crime 
problem.
 4. Differentiate between the three 
basic component agencies of 
criminal justice
Police maintain public order, 
 
■
deter crime, and apprehend 
law violators. Police depart-
ments are now experimenting 
with community- and problem-
oriented policing. The courts 
determine the criminal liability 
of accused offenders brought 
before them and dispense sanc-
tions to those found guilty of 
crime. Corrections agencies 
provide postadjudicatory care 
to offenders who are sentenced 
by the courts to confi nement or 
community supervision. 
 5. Comprehend the size and scope 
of the contemporary justice 
system
The contemporary criminal jus-
 
■
tice system in the United States 
is monumental in size. It now 
costs federal, state, and local 
governments more than $200 
billion per year for the civil 
and criminal justice system, 
which now employs more than 
2 million people. The system 
now processes, treats, and cares 
for millions of people. Almost 
SUMMARY
14 million people are still being 
 arrested each year; and there 
are more than 7 million people 
in the correctional system.
 6. Trace the formal criminal 
 justice process
The process consists of the 
 
■
actual steps the offender takes 
from the initial investigation 
through trial, sentencing, and 
appeal. The justice process 
begins with initial contact by 
a police agency and proceeds 
through investigation and 
custody, trial stages, and cor-
rectional system processing. At 
any stage of the process, the of-
fender may be excused because 
evidence is lacking, the case 
is trivial, or a decision maker 
simply decides to discontinue 
interest in the case. The justice 
process contains 15 stages, each 
of which is a decision point 
through which cases fl ow. Each 
of these decisions can have a 
critical effect on the defendant, 
the justice system, and society.
 7. Know what is meant by the 
term criminal justice assembly 
line
Herbert Packer described the 
 
■
criminal justice process as an 
assembly-line conveyor belt 
down which moves an endless 
stream of cases. At each stage of 
the process, a case may be re-
moved from the system or con-
tinued on to a formal resolution 
such as conviction and sentenc-
ing. The system therefore acts

as a “funnel” in which many 
cases enter but relatively few 
travel through all its stages and 
decision points. 
 8. Recognize the connection be-
tween the justice system and 
the rule of law
Procedures, policies, and 
 
■
practices employed within the 
criminal justice system are scru-
tinized by the courts to make 
sure they do not violate the 
guidelines in the Bill of Rights. 
If a violation occurs, the defen-
dant can appeal the case and 
seek to overturn the conviction. 
Among the rights that must be 
honored are freedom from il-
legal searches and seizures, and 
treatment with overall fairness 
and due process.
 9. Understand that there is more 
than one view on what justice 
is all about
The role of criminal justice can 
 
■
be interpreted in many ways. 
People who study the fi eld or 
work in its agencies bring their 
own ideas and feelings to bear 
when they try to decide on the 
right course of action to take or 
recommend. Therefore there are 
a number of different perspec-
tives on criminal justice today. 
Perspectives range from the 
most conservative (crime con-
trol) to the most liberal (restor-
ative justice).
10. Distinguish among the six dif-
ferent perspectives of justice
Several different philosophies 
 
■
or perspectives dominate the 
justice process. The crime con-
trol model asserts that the goals 
of justice are protection of the 
public and incapacitation of 
known offenders. The equal 
justice model calls for fair, 
equal treatment for all offend-
ers. The due process model em-
phasizes liberal principles, such 
as legal rights and procedural 
fairness for the offender. The 
rehabilitation model views the 
justice system as a wise and car-
ing parent. The nonintervention 
perspective calls for minimal 
interference in offenders’ lives. 
The restorative justice model 
seeks nonpunitive, humane so-
lutions to the confl ict inherent 
in crime and victimization.

the formal and informal justice 
systems. Is it fair to treat some 
 offenders informally?
 2 What are the basic elements of 
each model or perspective on jus-
tice? Which best represents your 
own point of view?
 3. How would each perspective on 
criminal justice consider the use 
of the death penalty as a sanction

opinion, does the death penalty 
serve as a deterrent to murder? If 
not, why not?
 4. Discuss the trends that will infl u-

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
 5. Why does the problem of sen-
tencing disparity exist? Do pro-
grams exist that can reduce 
disparate sentences? If so, what 
are they?
 6. Should people who commit the 
same crime receive the same 
sentence?

WHEN
When Michigan police, armed with a search warrant, came to the home of Booker T. Hudson, Jr., they 
knocked on the door, shouted “police,” waited less than fi ve seconds, and broke into the apartment. They 
found crack cocaine in Hudson’s pockets and a gun wedged in a chair nearby. Hudson was later convicted 
on drug charges despite the fact that state law required that police announce their presence during raids and 
give occupants a chance to come to the door—the so-called knock and announce rule. After his conviction, 
Hudson appealed his case all the way to the Supreme Court, arguing that his rights had been violated by this 
“no knock” search.1
Should the police be forced to knock, announce their presence, wait for a few minutes, and give a wanted 
criminal such as Hudson the opportunity to arm himself and shoot fi rst? On the other hand, should police 
offi cers have the right to burst into someone’s home even if their purpose is to serve a search warrant? Doesn’t 
such an unexpected entrance violate a person’s right to privacy and dignity? And should the evidence seized 
in such a raid, in this case crack cocaine, be excluded from trial simply because the police violated a rule 
governing proper procedure? What is fair? What is just?

578  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
a criminal defendant. Their interpretation of such abstract 
legal concepts as “privacy” and “inevitable discovery” shape 
the scope of police behavior. Before Hudson, police execut-
ing a search warrant had to worry that evidence might be 
excluded if they did not fi rst knock on the door, announce 
themselves, and wait a reasonable time for a response before 
forcing their way in. Now they can act fi rst and ask later. 
The judiciary supported law enforcement’s need to obtain 
valid evidence in as safe a manner as possible.
In this chapter, we will review each of these institutions 
and evaluate their structure, goals, and process. We begin 
with a discussion of the police role as a crime fi ghting agency.
THE POLICE AND SOCIETY
The police and other law enforcement agents (such as fed-
eral agents and state investigators) are the gatekeepers of the 
criminal justice process. They initiate contact with law vio-
lators and decide whether to formally arrest them and start 
their journey through the criminal justice system, settle the 
issue in an informal way (by issuing a warning), or simply 
take no action at all.
Police offi cers’ responsibilities are immense; they may 
suddenly be faced with an angry mob, an armed felon, or a 
suicidal teenager and be forced to make 
split-second decisions on what action 
to take. At the same time, they must be 
sensitive to the needs of citizens who are 
often of diverse racial and ethnic back-
grounds. When police are present and 
visible, it creates a sense of security in 
a neighborhood and improves residents’ 
opinions of the police.2
In carrying out these critical tasks, 
local police and law enforcement agents 
are given a great deal of discretion in 
their decision making. Some critics 
believe that they use this freedom in a 
biased fashion. Because of the repeated 
allegation that police offi cers harass mi-
nority citizens and use their arrest pow-
ers in a biased manner, the term racial 
profiling has become part of the ver-
nacular. In response, police departments 
have undertaken efforts to train police 
in human relations and create more sen-
sitivity toward the community. Though 
police agencies tend to be traditional or-
ganizations that are resistant to change, 
a great deal of progress has been made 
in improving community relations.3
Programs have been created to improve 
A
Police officers’ responsibilities are immense; they must be sensitive to the needs of citizens who 
are often of diverse age, gender, economic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. When police fail to 
be understanding, tragedy may occur. In this image from video released by the New Hampshire 
Attorney General’s Office, police officer Bruce McKay is spraying mace at Liko Kenney on May 11, 
2007, in Franconia, New Hampshire. Kenney, the cousin of ski champ Bode Miller, shot and 
killed McKay and then was himself killed by passing motorist Greg Floyd, who witnessed the 
shooting, picked up McKay’s gun, and shot Kenney. Kenney and McKay had engaged 
in a long-running feud that ended in their deaths. 
AP Images/New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office 
As every fan of the long-running series Law & Order knows, 
“In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by 
two separate, yet equally important, groups: the police, who 
investigate crime, and the district attorneys who prosecute 
the offenders.” It is these two agencies of criminal justice—
law enforcement and the courts—that are assigned the criti-
cal role of investigating crime, apprehending and arresting 
criminal suspects, charging them with an offense, and adju-
dicating their case. Given the delicate task of balancing the 
needs of the victim, the protection of society, and the civil 
rights of the accused, these agencies of justice must operate 
within the boundaries of the rule of law and be mindful of 
the legal restrictions placed on their behavior.
The ruling in the Hudson case refl ects this dynamic. The 
Supreme Court decided that the search was constitutional 
and allowed Hudson’s conviction to stand. The majority 
concluded that even if their entry was somewhat abrupt, the 
police would have eventually executed the warrant they had 
obtained, and would have discovered the gun and drugs in-
side the house. Therefore the discovery of the contraband 
was inevitable and should be allowed. The Court seemed 
to fear that if the “knock and announce” rule was infl exible, 
patently guilty defendants might go free because otherwise 
valid evidence would have to be thrown out of court. The 
“social cost” of freeing a dangerous drug dealer was too high, 
in their opinion, when compared to the loss of Hudson’s pri-
vacy. Here we can see how the judicial branch must balance 
the greater needs of society with the more narrow rights of

CHAPTER 17 | Police and the Courts: Investigation, Arrest, and Adjudication  579
In 1908, this group of investigators was formally made a 
distinct branch of the government, the Bureau of Investi-
gation; in the 1930s, the agency was reorganized into the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under the direction 
of J. Edgar Hoover.
Today’s FBI is not a police agency but an investigative 
agency with jurisdiction over all law enforcement matters 
in which the United States is or may be an interested party. 
However, its jurisdiction is limited to federal laws, including 
all federal statutes not specifi cally assigned to other agen-
cies. Areas covered by these laws include espionage, sabo-
tage, treason, civil rights violations, murder and assault of 
federal offi cers, mail fraud, robbery and burglary of federally 
insured banks, kidnapping, and interstate transportation of 
stolen vehicles and property.
The FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., oversees 
more than 50 fi eld offi ces, approximately 400 satellite of-
fi ces known as resident agencies, 4 specialized fi eld instal-
lations, and more than 60 foreign liaison posts. The foreign 
liaison offi ces, each of which is headed by a legal attaché 
or legal liaison offi cer, work abroad with U.S. and local au-
thorities on criminal matters within FBI jurisdiction. In all, 
the FBI has approximately 35,000 employees, including ap-
proximately 13,800 special agents and 21,000 support per-
sonnel, who perform professional, administrative, technical, 
clerical, craft, trade, or maintenance operations.5
The FBI also offers important services to local law en-
forcement agencies, including use of its vast fi ngerprint fi le 
and a sophisticated crime laboratory that aids local police in 
testing and identifying evidence, such as hair, fi ber, blood, 
tire tracks, and drugs. The FBI’s National Crime Information 
Center is a computerized network linked to local police de-
partments by terminals. Through it, information on stolen 
vehicles, wanted persons, stolen guns, and so on is made 
readily available to local law enforcement agencies. As Ex-
hibit 17.1 shows, in the post-9/11 world, the FBI has shifted 
its priorities to counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and 
cyberterrorism.
In addition to the FBI, the following agencies are part of 
federal law enforcement:
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). 
 
■
Investigates il-
legal drug use and carries out independent surveillance 
and enforcement activities to control the importation of 
narcotics.
U.S. Marshals. 
 
■
Court offi cers who help implement 
federal court rulings, transport prisoners, and enforce 
court orders. They are involved in protection of federal 
judicial offi cials, which includes judges, attorneys, and 
jurors. The Marshals Service Witness Security Program

LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AGENCIES TODAY
Law enforcement duties are distributed across local, county, 
state, and federal jurisdictions. Police and law enforcement 
agencies can be found at several levels of government (see 
Concept Summary 17.1).
Federal Law Enforcement
The federal government maintains about 50 organizations 
that are involved in law enforcement. Some of the most im-
portant of these are discussed here.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation In 1870, the U.S. 
Department of Justice became involved in actual policing 
when the attorney general hired investigators to enforce the 
Mann Act (which prohibited prostitution across state lines).

of the county treasury, and providers of fi re, animal control, 
and emergency medical services. In years past, sheriff’s of-
fi ces also conducted executions.
Some sheriff’s departments are exclusively law enforce-
ment oriented; some carry out only court-related duties; 
some are involved solely in correctional and judicial mat-
ters and not in law enforcement. However, a majority are 
full-service programs that carry out judicial, correctional, 
and law enforcement activities. As a rule, agencies serv-
ing large population areas (more than 1 million people) 
are devoted to maintaining county correctional facilities, 
whereas those in smaller population areas focus on law 
enforcement.
In the past, sheriffs’ salaries were almost always based 
on the fees they received for the performance of offi cial acts. 
They received fees for every summons, warrant, subpoena, 
writ, or other process they served. They were also compen-
sated for summoning juries or locking prisoners in cells. To-
day, sheriffs are salaried to avoid confl ict of interest.
State Police
The Texas Rangers, organized in 1835, are considered by 
some the fi rst state police force. However, the Rangers were 
more a quasimilitary force that supported the Texas state 
militia than a law enforcement body. The Rangers were fol-
lowed by the Massachusetts State Constables in 1865, the 
Arizona Rangers in 1901, and Connecticut State Police in 
1903; Pennsylvania formed the fi rst truly independent state 
police in 1905.8
The impetus for creating state police agencies can be 
traced both to the low regard of the public for the crime-
fi ghting ability of local police agencies and to the increas-
ingly greater mobility of law violators. Using automobiles, 
thieves could strike at will and be out of the jurisdiction 
of local police before an investigation could be mounted. 
Therefore, it became necessary to have a law enforcement 
agency with statewide jurisdiction. Also, state police gave 
governors a powerful enforcement arm that was under their 
personal control and not that of city politicians.
The nation’s 80,000 state police employees (55,000 of-
ficers and 25,000 civilians) are not only involved in law 
enforcement and highway safety but carry out a variety of 
functions, including maintaining a training academy and 
providing emergency medical services. State police crime 
laboratories aid local departments in investigating crime 
scenes and analyzing evidence. State police also provide spe-
cial services and technical expertise in such areas as bomb-
site analysis and homicide investigation. Other state police 
departments, such as California’s, are involved in highly so-
phisticated traffi c and highway safety programs that include 
using helicopters for patrol and rescue, testing safety devices 
for cars, and conducting postmortem examinations to deter-
mine the causes of fatal accidents.
Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
■
 Established in 1862, the 
IRS enforces violations of income, excise, stamp, and 
other tax laws. Its intelligence division actively pur-
sues gamblers, narcotics dealers, and other violators 
who do not report their illegal fi nancial gains as tax-
able income.
County Law Enforcement
The county sheriff’s role has evolved from that of the early 
English shire reeve, whose primary duty was to assist the 
royal judges in trying prisoners and enforcing sentences. 
From the time of the westward expansion in the United States 
until municipal departments were developed, the sheriff was 
often the sole legal authority over vast territories.
Today, more than 3,000 sheriff’s offi ces operate nation-
wide, employing more than 330,000 full-time staff, includ-
ing about 175,000 sworn personnel.6 Nearly all sheriffs’ 
offi ces provide basic law enforcement services such as rou-
tine patrol (97 percent), responding to citizen calls for ser-
vice (95 percent), and investigating crimes (92 percent).7 
Typically, a sheriff’s department’s law enforcement functions 
are restricted to unincorporated areas within a county, un-
less a city or town police department requests its help.
The duties of a county sheriff’s department vary accord-
ing to the size and degree of development of the county. The 
standard tasks of a typical sheriff’s department are serving 
civil process (summons and court orders), providing court 
security, operating the county jail, and investigating crimes. 
Less commonly, sheriff’s departments may serve as coroners, 
tax collectors, overseers of highways and bridges, custodians

CHAPTER 17 | Police and the Courts: Investigation, Arrest, and Adjudication  581
PREVENTING AND 
DETERRING CRIME
One of the primary goals of police work is to deter criminal 
behavior. The visible presence of patrol cars on the street 
and the rapid deployment of police offi cers to the scene of 
a crime are viewed as effective methods of crime control. 
Unfortunately, research efforts designed to measure the ef-
fectiveness of patrol have not supported its deterrence ca-
pability. The most widely heralded attempt at measuring 
patrol effectiveness was undertaken during the early 1970s 
in Kansas City, Missouri, where researchers divided 15 sepa-
rate police districts into three groups: one group retained 
normal patrol; the second (proactive) set of districts were 
supplied with two to three times the normal amount of pa-
trol forces; and the third (reactive) group had its preventive 
patrol eliminated, with police offi cers responding only when 
summoned by citizens to the scene of a particular crime.11 
The Kansas City study found that these variations in patrol 
had little effect on the crime patterns in the 15 districts. The 
presence or absence of patrol offi cers did not seem to af-
fect residential or business burglaries, motor vehicle thefts, 
larceny involving auto accessories, robberies, vandalism, 
or other criminal behavior, nor did it infl uence citizens’ at-
titudes toward the police, their satisfaction with police, or 
their fear of future criminal behavior.
As a result of the Kansas City study, a number of innova-
tive techniques have been developed to improve the effec-
tiveness of the police as a crime-deterring force.
Proactive Patrol
Although the mere presence of police may not be suffi-
cient to deter crime, the manner in which they approach 
their task may make a difference. Improving response time 
and increasing the number of patrol cars that respond per 
crime may be one way of increasing police effi ciency.12 Ju-
risdictions that encourage patrol offi cers to stop motor ve-
hicles to issue citations and to aggressively arrest and detain 
suspicious persons also experience lower crime rates than 
jurisdictions that do not follow such proactive policies.13 
Departments that more actively enforce minor regulations, 
such as disorderly conduct and traffi c laws, are also more 
likely to experience lower felony rates.14
Pinpointing why proactive policing works so effectively 
is diffi cult. It may have a deterrent effect: aggressive polic-
ing increases community perception that police arrest many 
criminals and that most violators get caught; criminals are 
scared to commit crimes in a town that has such an active 
police force. Proactive policing may also help control crime 
because it results in conviction of more criminals. Because 
aggressive police arrest more suspects, there are fewer left 
Metropolitan Police
The estimated 12,575 local police departments operating 
in the United States during 2007 employed approximately 
463,000 full-time sworn personnel.9 Metropolitan police de-
partments range in size from the New York City Police De-
partment, with almost 40,000 full-time offi cers and 10,000 
civilian employees, to rural police departments, which may 
have only a single part-time offi cer.
In addition to sworn personnel, many police agencies 
hire civilian employees who bring special skills to the de-
partment. In this computer age, departments often em-
ploy information resource managers, who are charged with 
improving data processing, integrating the department’s 
computer information database with others in the state, op-
erating computer-based fi ngerprint identifi cation systems 
and other high-tech investigative devices, and linking with 
national computer systems such as the FBI’s national crime 
information system, which holds the records of millions of 
criminal offenders. To carry out these tasks, local depart-
ments employ an additional 138,000 civilians, bringing the 
entire number to more than 600,000 people.
Most larger urban departments are independent agen-
cies operating without specifi c administrative control from 
any higher governmental authority. They are organized at 
the executive level of government. It is therefore common 
for the city mayor (or the equivalent) to control the hiring 
and fi ring of the police chief and, consequently, determine 
departmental policies. Traditionally, municipal departments 
were organized in a militaristic way, often using military 
terms to designate seniority (sergeant, lieutenant, captain). 
This organization is now changing as police departments 
become more decentralized.
Local police perform multiple roles, including but not 
limited to investigating crimes, identifying suspects, and 
making arrests. While most people are familiar with these 
law enforcement goals of police, there are actually many 
tasks performed by patrol offi cers:

The organization of a typical metropolitan police de-
partment is illustrated in Figure 17.1. This complex struc-
ture is a function of the multiplicity of roles with which the 
police are entrusted; these roles fall into three main catego-
ries (Exhibit 17.2).

on the street to commit crime; fewer criminals produce 
lower crime rates.
Is It Worth the Effort? Aggressive police patrol efforts 
have been a critical success. The downturn in the New York 
City violent crime rate in the 1990s was attributed to ag-
gressive police work aimed at lifestyle crimes: vandalism, 
panhandling, and graffi ti.15 However, there is no empirical 
proof that aggressive policing alone can account for reduc-
tions in the crime rate and, as some commentators warn, 
aggressive policing may carry its own baggage: it can cause 
friction between proactive cops and the general public, espe-
cially if the police target racial minorities. A recent analysis 
of aggressive policing in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn 
between January 2006 and March 2010 shows the danger of 
this approach. Data analysis fi nds that police efforts gener-
ated few concrete results, but helped create mistrust of the 
police. During this four-year period, police offi cers made 
nearly 52,000 stops in an eight-block area, nearly one stop 
a year for every one of the 14,000 residents. In some in-
stances, people were stopped because the police said they 
fi t the description of a suspect, but most stops were made 
for the vague reason that they made a “furtive movement,” a 
catch-all category that can mean almost anything. While the 
underlying purpose of the aggressive stop policy was to get 
guns off the streets, the results were tepid at best: in 2009, 
the police made 13,200 stops in Brownsville that resulted in 
arrests of 109 people. In the more than 50,000 stops since 
2006, the police recovered 25 guns at the expense of un-
settling the community. While some residents applauded 
to local governments—helping them guard 
their public transport systems, among other 
services. Wackenhut helps the U.S. govern-
ment protect nuclear reactors, guards the 
Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, and main-
tains security in closed government facilities. 
It maintains a Custom Protection Officer Di-
vision, made up of highly trained uniformed 
security officers assigned to critical or com-
plex facilities or situations requiring special 
skills in such places as government build-
ings, banks, and other special situations.
Why Has Private Policing Become So 
Popular?
Why is private policing so popular? There 
are three answers to this question:
A preference for nongovernmental provi-
 
■
sion of important services, particularly 
crime control.
The growth of mass private property, 
 
■
particularly large shopping malls and 
other properties that attract large num-
bers of consumers and have little other 
police protection.
A belief that private corporations are bet-
 
■
ter capable of providing the level of ser-
vice and presence that the public desires.
Is There a Downside?
While popular, there is some concern that 
privatization puts the profit motive ahead 
of protection of public safety. There is also 
a danger that private police agents can 
act outside the law or violate rights with 
impunity. The U.S. Supreme Court has re-
peatedly stated that purely private search 
activities do not violate the Fourth Amend-
ment’s prohibitions. It is unclear whether 
private security agents are subject to Fourth 
Amendment requirements if they are per-
forming services that are traditionally re-
served for the police, such as guarding 
communities.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Is there a conflict of interest in turning 
over police power to a private corpora-
tion? Might they cut corners to make 
a profit? On the other hand, we have 
private schools and hospitals, why not 
police?
 2. Are private police agents bound by the 
same legal rules that state and local 
police must obey?

Private Policing
Supplementing local police forces is a bur-
geoning private security industry. Private 
security service, or private policing, has 
become a multi-billion-dollar industry with 
10,000 firms and more than 2 million em-
ployees. Even some federal police services 
have been privatized to cut expenses. 
There are two broad classes of security pro-
fessionals: proprietary security personnel, 
who are directly employed by organizations 
that desire asset protection, and security 
services professionals, who provide security 
products and services for various organiza-
tions. The security services industry sells 
equipment (such as closed-circuit televi-
sion and security systems), installs and 
maintains equipment, provides uniformed 
security guards, conducts investigations, 
performs risk assessments, protects high-
value shipments, and so on.
Some private security firms have become 
billion-dollar companies. Typical of these se-
curity giants is G4S Secure Solutions USA 
(formerly the Wackenhut Corporation), one 
of the world’s largest providers of security 
services. Among its clients are a number 
of Fortune 500 companies. It has several 
subsidiaries that work for the federal gov-
ernment. Wackenhut Services Incorporated 
(WSI) is a primary contractor to NASA and 
the U.S. Army. Wackenhut also provides 
security and emergency response services

584  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Why did this program work (even though the actual 
number of guns seized was minimal)? It is possible that the 
weapons were taken from high-rate offenders who were 
among the most likely perpetrators of gun-related crimes; 
their “lost opportunity” to commit violent crimes may have 
resulted in an overall crime and violence rate decrease, a 
so-called diffusion of benefi ts.18 It is also possible that the 
gun sweeps caused some of the most violent criminals to be 
taken off the streets. And as word of the patrol got out, there 
may have been a general deterrent effect: people contem-
plating violent crime may have been convinced that appre-
hension risks were unacceptably high.19 It is also possible 
that these aggressive patrol areas became inhospitable to 
would-be criminals who, like people in general, don’t like 
to step out of their comfort zone. Rather than move, they 
stopped committing crime.
Making Arrests
Can formal police action, such as an arrest, reduce crime? 
While the evidence is mixed, some research studies do show 
that contact with the police may cause some offenders to 
forgo repeat criminal behavior. Many first offenders will 
forgo criminal activity after undergoing arrest.20 An arrest 
for drunk driving reduces the likelihood of further driving 
while intoxicated. An arrest apparently increases people’s 
belief that they will be rearrested if they drink and drive and 
heightens their perception of the unpleasantness associated 
with an arrest.21 Consequently, as the number of arrests per 
capita increases, crime rates go down.
Why do arrests inhibit crime? It is 
possible that news of increased and ag-
gressive police arrest activity is rapidly 
diffused through the population and has 
an immediate impact on crime rates.22 It 
is also likely that this impact on crime 
rates may erode over time. Thus, studies 
using data collected annually may miss 
this immediate deterrent effect.
Adding Patrol Officers
One reason why patrol activity may be 
less effective than desired is the lack of 
adequate resources. A number of recent 
studies have found that police pres-
ence may bring crime levels down and 
that adding police may further reduce 
crime levels.23 Evidence shows that cit-
ies with larger police departments that 
have more officers per capita than the 
norm experience lower levels of violent 
crimes.24 During the past decade, larger 
cities expanded their police forces and 
police efforts, others felt violated, degraded, and resentful.16 
Criticism of the police has led to the growth of private polic-
ing, a topic covered in the Policy and Practice in Criminol-
ogy feature on the previous page.
TARGETING CRIMES
Evidence also shows that targeting specifi c crimes can be 
successful. Directed patrol involves assigning officers to a 
particular area to proactively investigate suspicious activities 
and to enforce existing gun, drug, traffi c, and related laws.17 
Offi cers assigned to directed patrol areas are freed from hav-
ing to respond to calls for service. The most common ap-
proach in a directed patrol effort is to make frequent traffi c 
stops targeting drivers who seem suspicious or fi t the profi le 
of drug traffi ckers. The strategy generally includes increas-
ing the number of police offi cers in a given location and the 
number of contacts with citizens. Some efforts have targeted 
specifi c crimes such as gun possession or drug traffi cking. 
The well-known Kansas City Gun Experiment was directed 
at restricting the carrying of guns in high-risk places at 
high-risk times. The program employed gun patrol offi cers 
who seized illegal weapons, made thousands of car and pe-
destrian checks and traffi c stops, and over 600 arrests. As a 
result of this targeted effort, drive-by shootings dropped sig-
nifi cantly, as did homicides. These improvements occurred 
without any displacement to other areas of the city.
One way to eliminate crime is to create specialized units that target specific crimes such as 
narcotics trafficking or gang activity. Here, officers from the Los Angeles Police Department 
gang unit check the occupants of a stopped vehicle for weapons on April 17, 2010. Another 
driver notified the police when she claimed the vehicle’s occupants threatened her with a 
handgun.

CHAPTER 17 | Police and the Courts: Investigation, Arrest, and Adjudication  585
areas investigations are conducted by police detectives and 
investigators.
Investigators often enter a case after it has been re-
ported to patrol offi cers or called into police headquarters, 
and then begin to accumulate enough evidence to identify 
the perpetrator or clear the crime.29 Detectives use various 
investigatory techniques. Sometimes they obtain finger-
prints from a crime scene and match them with those on 
fi le. Other cases demand the aid of informers to help iden-
tify perpetrators. In some instances, victims or witnesses 
are asked to identify offenders by viewing their pictures, 
or mug shots, or by pulling them out of lineups. It is also 
possible for detectives to solve a crime by being familiar 
with the working methods of particular offenders—their 
modus operandi (MO). The detective identifi es the sus-
pect by matching the facts of the crime with the offender’s 
peculiar habits or actions. In some cases, stolen property is 
located, and then the case is cleared when those purchas-
ing the items identify the sellers. For example, police locate 
a stolen diamond ring in a pawnshop and the owner tells 
them from whom he purchased the item. In other cases, 
the suspect is arrested on another matter and subsequently 
found to possess stolen merchandise, or during routine 
questioning, they confess to other criminal acts in exchange 
for leniency. Sometimes people will spontaneously confess 
simply to reduce their feelings of guilt and remorse. Typi-
cally, the more serious the case, with murder being the ex-
treme example, the longer detectives will devote to a single 
crime and the more likely they will eventually be able to 
identify and arrest the culprit.30
crime rates plummeted—a trend that indicates that adding 
police may in fact reduce crime rates.
Why does adding police reduce crime rates? The obvious 
reason is that an expanded police presence deters would-be 
criminals. There may also be residual effects. Increasing police 
resources may improve the overall effectiveness of the justice 
system. When resources are lacking, many cases are dropped 
before they ever get to trial because it becomes diffi cult to 
gather suffi cient evidence to ensure a conviction; prosecutors 
are likely to drop these cases.25 Adding police resources im-
proves the quality of police work with the spillover effect of 
increasing the effectiveness of the entire justice process.
Rapid Response It is widely assumed that criminals can 
be caught if the police can simply get to the scene of a crime 
quickly, a so-called rapid response. Simply put, the shorter 
the police travel time from assignment to arrival at a crime 
scene, the more likely it is that police can arrest offenders 
before they fl ee. Rapid response is believed to be effective 
because it will reduce criminal harm by limiting the time for 
crime and also because it deters would-be criminals afraid 
of a rapidly responding police department.26
But does the research support this view? Unfortunately, 
the jury is still out: some researchers have found that a quick 
response can be benefi cial while others question the utility 
of rapid response.27
Using Technology
Police have made a concerted effort to deter crime with the 
aid of technology. CompStat, begun in New York City in 1994 
as a means of directing police efforts in a more productive 
fashion, is one of the most famous police technology efforts.28 
CompStat is a computer-based system that gives local precinct 
commanders information about where and when crime is oc-
curring in their jurisdiction. Commanders are provided with 
detailed data and electronic pin maps that show how crime is 
clustering geographically in the precinct and how patrol offi -
cers are being deployed. A key element of CompStat is weekly 
crime control strategy meetings during which the crime data 
are disseminated and the department’s executives and com-
manders frankly discuss the problems they face. The process 
allows police leaders to share ideas and devise crime reduction 
tactics with commanders from other districts who may have 
confronted similar issues (see Concept Summary 17.2).
INVESTIGATING CRIME

586  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Efforts have been made to revamp investigation proce-
dures. Patrol offi cers have been given greater responsibilities 
in conducting preliminary investigations at crime scenes. In 
addition, the precinct detective is being replaced by special-
ized units, such as homicide or burglary squads, that operate 
over larger areas and can bring specifi c expertise to bear on 
a particular case. Another trend has been the development 
of regional squads of local, state, and federal offi cers (called 
regional strike forces) that concentrate on major crimes and 
organized crime activities and use their wider jurisdiction 
and expertise to provide services beyond the capabilities of 
a metropolitan police department. An additional common 
operation is to focus on the investigation and arrest of hard-
core career criminals.38 Ever more specialized units are being 
created. Washington, D.C.’s metropolitan police department 
operates a Major Case/Cold Case Unit that is composed of 
eight detectives. They work closely with crime and intelli-
gence analysts as well as homicide prosecutors from the U.S. 
Attorney’s Offi ce. Additionally, the Major Case/Cold Case de-
tectives receive assistance as needed from the Special Victims 
Unit (who handle all child deaths), as well as other special-
ized units.39 A case is considered “cold” after three years. 
One unique aspect of the unit is the Violent Crime Case Re-
view Project, which includes one detective who oversees sev-
eral college interns. These interns, primarily specially trained 
graduate students studying forensic psychology, criminology, 
or other related fi elds, are involved in the comprehensive 
and systematic review of all homicide cases going back to the 
1960s. The interns determine if the case is open or closed, 
determine the status of all suspects, summarize the case, pre-
pare it for entry in investigative databases, and help to priori-
tize cases with high solvability factors. One of their primary 
functions is to identify cases that may benefi t from advances 
in forensic technology—specifi cally DNA testing.40 The story 
of a cold case is the subject of the Profi les in Crime feature, 
“James Ford Seale: Mississippi Burning.”
Other cities have now adopted the cold case model.

Police Department and learn about one such program,

There have also been efforts to improve technology, but 
as The Criminological Enterprise feature shows, not all have 
been successful.
Legal Controls over Police 
Investigation
To identify and arrest criminal suspects, patrol offi cers and de-
tectives engage in such tasks as searching for evidence, seizing 
contraband such as guns and drugs, interrogating suspects, 
and having witnesses and victims identify suspects. Even if 
Detectives can also work undercover and/or engage in 
sting operations.31 A detective might pose as a fence with 
the hope that thieves interested in selling stolen merchan-
dise will initiate contact. Transactions are videotaped to pro-
vide prosecutors with strong cases. Sting-type undercover 
operations are controversial because they involve a police 
offi cer becoming involved in illegal activity and encourag-
ing offenders to break the law. Stings may encourage crime 
when area residents realize that someone is offering cash for 
stolen goods.32 The ethics of undercover work and sting op-
erations have been questioned, especially when the police 
actively recruit criminals or when police engage in shady 
behavior to win the trust of criminals. Nonetheless, sting 
operations seem to have found a permanent place in the law 
enforcement repertoire.
Some jurisdictions maintain morals squads or vice 
squads, which are usually staffed by plainclothes offi cers or 
detectives specializing in victimless crimes such as prostitu-
tion or gambling. Vice squad offi cers work undercover and 
impersonate customers looking for illicit activities. Police 
offi cers often pose as prostitutes and arrest men who solicit 
their services. These covert police activities have often been 
criticized as violating the personal rights of citizens, and 
their appropriateness and fairness have been questioned.
Are Investigations Effective? 
Though investigations can be exacting and time consum-
ing, detectives get great satisfaction from solving crimes 
and putting criminals behind bars.33 But many also see 
themselves caught in a bureaucratic and moral dilemma. To 
solve the crime, they must be street smart, bend the rules, 
and work amidst the mayhem caused by dangerous crimi-
nals. They must bring the case to the organized and highly 
controlled processing unit that is the criminal court. De-
tectives believe that the court rules victimize them and all 
too often neutralize their hard work. Talking with suspects 
for hours on end, they form ironclad beliefs based on their 
assessment of the criminal’s character and record. Because 
the reliability of these assessments may be questionable, 
even the best detectives are sometimes dead wrong. Partly 
to guard against such errors of judgment, the law deliber-
ately ignores individuals’ criminal histories and allows no 
consideration at trial of the police detectives’ assessment of 
the suspects’ moral character. Of course, these rules con-
fl ict with the detectives’ views of the case and the culpabil-
ity of the suspect.34 And while detectives in the movies and 
on television always capture the villains, research indicates 
that real detectives are much less successful.35 Detectives 
rarely identify culprits after the crime has been completed, 
and when a suspect is identifi ed, it usually takes place at 
the crime scene or through routine follow-up procedures.36
Detectives drop up to 75 percent of cases if a few hours 
have elapsed after the crime occurred and the perpetrator 
has not been identifi ed.37

they can easily and swiftly identify the perpetrator, they know 
that their investigation must still be thorough. At trial, they 
will need to provide the prosecutor with suffi cient evidence to 
prove guilt “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Therefore, soon after 
the crime is committed, they must make every effort to gather 
physical evidence, obtain confessions, and take witness state-
ments that will be adequate to prove the case in court. Police 
offi cers also realize that evidence the prosecutor is counting 
on to prove the case, such as the testimony of a witness or co-
conspirator, may evaporate before the trial begins. Then the 
case outcome may depend on some piece of physical evidence 
or a suspect’s statement taken early in the investigation.
Because of these requirements, investigators sometimes 
go too far in their effort to identify suspects and prove 
their case. As a result, their investigatory techniques may 
violate a suspect’s civil rights. As they gather evidence, in-
vestigators must walk a fi ne line that separates legal and 
illegal police work. A number of critical decisions must 
take place:

Washington before a subcommittee of the 
House Committee on Un-American Ac-
tivities, which was investigating the Klan. 
Along with nine other alleged members 
of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, 
including his father, Clyde Seale, and 
Charles Marcus Edwards, he invoked the 
Fifth Amendment and refused to testify. 
An informant identified Seale but was too 
fearful to testify, and with a lack of other 
witnesses, the district attorney could not 
prosecute the suspects. Three of them lived 
out their lives and died free men. Seale and 
another accomplice remained free and im-
mune from prosecution for more than 40 
years. Then interest in the unsolved case 
was revived in 2005 when Charles Moore’s 
brother Thomas and a documentary film-
maker discovered that Seale was alive and 
still living in Mississippi. They convinced 
federal and local law enforcement agents 
to reopen the case and gather evidence. A 
federal–state task force was created and 
assembled enough evidence against Seale 
to bring the case before a grand jury and 
gain an indictment.
While unusual, the Seale case is not 
unique. A number of civil rights era killings 
were investigated and solved many years 
after the fact:
 In 2001, Thomas Blanton, Jr., and 
 
■
Bobby Frank Cherry were convicted 
of murder for the 1963 bombing of 
the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in 
 Birmingham, Alabama.
 In 2003, Ernest Avants was sentenced to 
 
■
life in prison for the 1966 murder of Ben 
White, an elderly African American farm 
worker.
 In 2005, Edgar Ray Killen was convicted 
 
■
of manslaughter and sentenced to three 
20-year sentences for his role in the 
deaths of three civil rights workers in 
Mississippi in 1964.
“There can be justice,” Henry Dee’s 
sister Thelma Collins remarked after 
Seale was arrested and charged. “I cried 
because I had shed so many tears over 
the years about it.” On August 24, 2007, 
James Ford Seale was sentenced to serve 
three life terms. He appealed the decision 
to the Fifth Circuit Appellate Court, which 
overturned his conviction on the grounds 
that the statute of limitations had expired. 
Prosecutors asked for a re-hearing and 
on June 5, 2009, the Fifth Circuit judges 
reinstated his three convictions and life 
sentences. On November 2, 2009, the 
Supreme Court declined to hear the case, 
and Seale is serving his sentence in an In-
diana prison.

James Ford Seale: Mississippi Burning
On May 2, 1964, two African American 
men, Charles Moore and Henry Dee, both 
19, were hitchhiking on their way to a party 
in Mississippi when they were stopped 
and abducted by members of the Ku Klux 
Klan. Suspected of being “troublemakers” 
and civil rights agitators, the pair were tied 
to a tree and severely beaten. Then while 
still alive they were driven 100 miles, tied to 
train rails, and dumped in the Ole River in 
Warren County, Mississippi. Their decom-
posed bodies were found two months later.
The plot is alleged to have been hatched 
and carried out by Klansman James 
Ford Seale. Long a suspect in the case, 
on January 14, 1966, Seale appeared in

■
Each of these decisions must be answered within the 
context of existing case law. So, even though police want a 
free hand to search homes and cars for evidence, the Con-
stitution’s Fourth Amendment restricts their activities and 
requires that they obtain a warrant before conducting the 
search. When police want to vigorously interrogate a sus-
pect, they must honor the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition 
against forcing people to incriminate themselves.
The U.S. Supreme Court has taken an active role in 
considering the legality of police operations. Of primary 
concern has been balancing the law enforcement agent’s 
need to investigate crimes with the citizen’s constitutional 
right to be free from illegal searches and interrogations. In 
some instances, the Supreme Court has expanded police 
power—for example, by increasing the occasions when 
police can search without a search warrant. In other cases, 
the Supreme Court has restricted police operations—for 
example, by ruling that every criminal suspect has a right 
to an attorney when being interrogated by police. Changes 
in the law often reflect such factors as the justices’ legal 
philosophy and concern for the ability of police to control 
crime, their views on the need to maintain public safety 
versus their commitment to the civil liberties of criminal 
defendants, and current events such as the 9/11 terrorist at-
tacks. Some important legal issues have emerged from this 
evidence of a victim’s husband is found 
in the house in which the couple lived 
and where the murder took place proves 
nothing. DNA would only be relevant if it 
were found under the fingernails of the 
victim who put up a struggle during the 
commission of a crime.
Questionable evidence.
 
■
 DNA evidence is 
regarded as a gold standard in criminal 
investigations. Consequently, juries now 
question identification made with other 
types of evidence, such as bite marks—
even fingerprint analysis has been called 
into question. As a result, it may be 
more difficult for prosecutors to obtain 
convictions without DNA.
Errors. 
 
■
There are disturbing errors and 
fraud in the forensic sciences. In one 
case, a state-mandated examination of 
the West Virginia State Police laboratory 
revealed that the convictions of more 
than 100 people were in doubt. Another 
scandal involving the Houston Crime 
Laboratory involved routine failure to 
run essential scientific controls, failure 
to take adequate measures to prevent 
contamination of samples, failure to ad-
equately document work performed and 
results obtained, and routine failure to 
follow correct procedures for computing 
statistical frequencies.
Incompatible fingerprint identification 
 
■
systems. Law enforcement agencies 
around the country have developed and 
put in place automated fingerprint iden-
tification systems in an effort to solve 
crimes. The problem is that there is in-
adequate integration of these systems.
The 
 
■
CSI effect. The so-called CSI effect, 
named for the popular television pro-
gram, is concerned with the real-world 
implications of Hollywood’s fictional spin 
on the forensic sciences and criminal 
investigations. Some prosecutors believe 
they must make their in-court presenta-
tions as visually appealing as possible 
in an effort to please jurors who think 
they understand forensic work from 
having watched their favorite television 
programs. Attempts to satisfy such unre-
alistic expectations can compromise the 
pursuit of justice.

Can Criminals Be Caught with Technology?
The public is bombarded with TV shows 
such as CSI that depict highly trained 
detectives using advanced technology to 
solve crimes. It seems no criminal has 
a chance of success when these super 
sleuths are on his trail. How accurate is 
this portrayal of detective work? The Na-
tional Academy of Sciences (NAS) recently 
reviewed the state of forensic science and 
found that things seem to work better on 
TV than in real life.
Case backlog.
 
■
 Federal, state, and local 
laboratories report a backlog of nearly 
500,000 requests for forensic analysis. 
This backlog has been made even more 
serious by requests for quick test results. 
Labs are having a difficult time keeping up 
with the demands of local departments.
DNA demands.
 
■
 Reliance on DNA evi-
dence and the opportunities to use it 
during investigations have further bur-
dened crime labs even though it is not 
used in most crimes. Moreover, it is not 
a magic bullet: even if DNA evidence is 
available, it will assist in solving a crime 
only if it was found under circumstances 
that make guilt or innocence more 
likely. For example, the fact that DNA

issuing what is known as the Miranda warning, which in-
forms the suspect that
 1. He or she has the right to remain silent.
 2. If he or she makes a statement, it can be used against 
him or her in court.
 3. He or she has the right to consult an attorney and to have 
the attorney present at the time of the interrogation.
 4. If he or she cannot afford an attorney, one will be ap-
pointed by the state.
If the defendant is not given the Miranda warning before 
the investigation, the evidence obtained from the interrogation 
cannot be admitted at trial. The accused can waive his or her 
Miranda rights at any time. However, for the waiver to be ef-
fective, the state must fi rst show that the defendant was aware 
of all the Miranda rights and must then prove that the waiver 
was made with the full knowledge of constitutional rights.
Miranda was a turning point in criminal procedure be-
cause it introduced attorneys into an early stage of the jus-
tice process. Police were concerned that the presence of an 
attorney would signifi cantly impede the investigation pro-
cess and hinder their ability to interrogate suspects and/or 
pressure them to confess. Without confessions, the ability to 
obtain evidence and convict defendants would be lost.
The Supreme Court has used case law to define the 
boundaries of the Miranda warning since its inception. Im-
portant Court rulings on the Miranda warning have created 
exceptions to the rule and guidelines for its implementation; 
some of the most important are set out in Exhibit 17.3.
While the future of the warning itself seems certain, it ap-
pears that recent rulings have narrowed the scope of Miranda 
and given police greater leeway in their actions.43 It is not sur-
prising that today police administrators who in the past might 
have been wary of the restrictions forced by Miranda now ac-
tually favor its use.44 They view the warning as irrefutable evi-
dence that they did not pressure suspects or use unfair tactics.
Search and Seizure
In order to conduct investigations, the police may want to 
search people, their cars, and their homes. In order to do 
so, they must under normal circumstances obtain a search 
warrant—a judicial order, based on probable cause, allow-
ing police offi cers to search for evidence in a particular place, 
seize that evidence, and carry it away. If seized with a valid 
warrant, the evidence can be used against the suspect at trial.
To make it easier for police to conduct investigations and 
to protect public safety, the Court has ruled that under cer-
tain circumstances a valid search may be conducted without 
a search warrant. The following are examples of when police 
may conduct a legal search without a warrant being issued:
Threshold inquiry (stop-and-frisk). 
 
■
A threshold inquiry 
occurs when an offi cer does not have probable cause to 
arrest, but his or her suspicions are legitimately aroused 
confl ict, the most critical being citizen rights during police 
interrogation and the right to be free from illegal searches 
and seizures by police offi cers.
Legal Arrest
In order for an arrest to be legal, the following conditions 
must exist:
The police offi cer must have suffi cient evidence that a 
 
■
crime is being or has been committed and intends to re-
strain the suspect. This is referred to as probable cause.
The police offi cer deprives the individual of his freedom.
 
■
The suspect believes that he is in the custody of the 
 
■
police offi cer and cannot voluntarily leave. He has lost 
his liberty.
Arrests can be initiated when an offi cer observes a crime 
or otherwise develops suffi cient probable cause to take a sus-
pect into custody or when an arrest warrant, a writ that di-
rects the police to bring the named person before the court, 
has been issued. In either case, an arrest must be based on 
probable cause that the person has committed or is attempt-
ing to commit a crime.
In the case of a felony, most jurisdictions provide that a 
police offi cer may arrest a suspect without a warrant where 
probable cause exists, even though the officer was not 
present when the offense was committed. The arrest can 
be based on statements made by victims and witnesses. As 
you may recall (Chapter 16), in the case of a misdemeanor 
the in-presence requirement mandates that probable cause 
and the officer’s presence at the time of the offense are 
required.
As a general rule, if the police make an arrest without a 
warrant, the arrestee must be brought before a magistrate 
promptly for a probable cause hearing. In Riverside County 
v. McLaughlin, the Supreme Court ruled that the police 
may detain an individual arrested without a warrant for up 
to 48 hours without a court hearing to determine whether 
arrest was justifi ed.41
Custodial Interrogation
The Fifth Amendment guarantees people the right to be free 
from self-incrimination. This has been interpreted as mean-
ing that law enforcement agents cannot use physical or psy-
chological coercion while interrogating suspects under their 
control to get them to confess or give information.
In 1966, the Supreme Court, in the case of Miranda v. 
Arizona, created objective standards for questioning by po-
lice after a defendant has been taken into custody.42 The 
Court maintained that before the police can question a per-
son who has been arrested or is in custody, they must in-
form the individual of the Fifth Amendment right to be free 
from self-incrimination. This is accomplished by the police

is lawful, the offi cer retains what he or she fi nds if it 
is connected with a crime. The offi cer is permitted to 
search only the defendant’s person and the areas in the 
defendant’s immediate physical surroundings that are 
under his or her control.47
Automobile search. 
 
■
An automobile may be searched with-
out a warrant if there is probable cause to believe that 
the car was involved in a crime.48 Because automobiles 
are inherently mobile, there is a signifi cant chance that 
the evidence will be lost if the search is not conducted 
immediately; also people should not expect as much 
privacy in their cars as in their homes.49 Police offi cers 
who have legitimately stopped an automobile and who 
have probable cause to believe that contraband is con-
cealed somewhere within it may conduct a warrantless 
search of the vehicle that is as thorough as a magistrate 
could authorize by warrant. The Supreme Court has 
also ruled that police who have stopped a motorist for a 
routine traffi c violation can conduct a search if they fi nd 
probable cause that the vehicle was also involved in a 
by the unusual or suspicious behavior of an individual. 
In such a case, the offi cer has a right to stop and ques-
tion the individual; if the offi cer has reason to believe 
that the person is carrying a concealed weapon, he or 
she may frisk the suspect. Frisking is limited to a pat-
down of the outer clothing for the purpose of fi nding a 
concealed weapon. If an illegal weapon is found, then 
an arrest can be made and a search incident to the ar-
rest performed.45 If while conducting a pat-down for 
weapons an offi cer discovers other contraband, the po-
lice may seize it and hold it for trial. Police are allowed 
to “act instantly if they have reasonable cause to suspect 
that the persons temporarily detained are armed and 
dangerous.”46
Search incident to an arrest. 
 
■
A warrantless search is valid 
if it is made incident to a lawful arrest. The reason for 
this exception is that the arresting offi cer must have the 
power to disarm the accused, protect himself or herself, 
preserve the evidence of the crime, and prevent the ac-
cused from escaping from custody. Because the search

Major Decisions on Custodial Interrogation
If defendants perjure themselves during trial, evidence ob-
 
■
tained in violation of the Miranda warning can be used by 
the government to impeach their testimony. Harris v. New 
York, 401 U.S. 222 (1971).
At trial, the testimony of a witness is permissible even 
 
■
though his or her identity was revealed by the defendant in 
violation of the Miranda rule. Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 
433 (1974).
The 
 
■
Miranda warning applies only to the right to have an 
attorney present; the suspect cannot demand to speak to 
a priest, probation officer, or any other official. Moran v. 
 Burbine, 106 S.Ct. 1135 (1986).
Information provided by a suspect that leads to the seizure 
 
■
of incriminating evidence is permissible if the evidence 
would have been obtained anyway by other means or 
sources; this is now referred to as the inevitable discovery 
rule. Nix v. Williams, 104 S.Ct. 2501 (1984).
Admissible evidence can be obtained without a 
 
■
Miranda 
warning if the information the police seek is needed to pro-
tect public safety; for example, in an emergency, suspects 
can be asked where they hid their weapons. Their answer 
can be used in a court of law even though they had not re-
ceived the Miranda warning; this is referred to as the  public 
safety doctrine. New York v. Quarles, 104 S.Ct. 2626 
(1984).
Initial errors by police in getting statements do not automati-
 
■
cally make subsequent statements inadmissible; a subse-
quent Miranda warning that is properly given can “cure the 
condition” that made the initial statements inadmissible. 
Oregon v. Elstad, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (1985). However, if police 
intentionally mislead suspects by questioning them before 
giving them a Miranda warning, their statements made 
after the warning is given are inadmissible in court. The 
“Miranda rule would be frustrated were the police permitted 
to undermine its meaning and effect.” Missouri v. Seibert, 
No. 02-1371 (2004).
Suspects need not be aware of all the possible outcomes of 
 
■
waiving their rights for the Miranda warning to be considered 
properly given. Colorado v. Spring, 107 S.Ct. 851 (1987).
The admissions of mentally impaired defendants can be 
 
■
admitted in evidence as long as the police acted properly 
and there is a “preponderance of the evidence” that the 
defendants understood the meaning of Miranda. Colorado v. 
Connelly, 107 S.Ct. 515 (1986).
Once a criminal suspect has invoked his or her 
 
■
Miranda rights, 
police officials cannot reinitiate interrogation in the absence of 
counsel even if the accused has consulted with an attorney in 
the meantime. Minnick v. Miss., 498 U.S. 46.
The erroneous admission of a coerced confession at trial 
 
■
can be ruled a “harmless error” that would not automati-
cally result in overturning a conviction. Arizona v. Fulmi-
nante, 499 U.S. 279.
It is possible for police to ask for a suspect’s cooperation 
 
■
even after counsel is appointed. The police may approach 
the defendant outside of the presence of counsel and seek 
to question him or her—even about the charge for which 
counsel was appointed as long as the statements are made 
voluntarily! Montejo v. Louisiana No. 07-1529 (2009).

crime; for example, after stopping a car for an illegal 
U-turn, they spot drug paraphernalia in the front seat.50 
However, if a motorist is arrested and taken out of the 
vehicle and is restrained (i.e., handcuffed and placed in 
a patrol car), the police may only search the vehicle if 
it is reasonable to assume the arrestee could access the 
vehicle or the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of 
arrest.51
Motorist and passenger search. 
 
■
Because traffi c stops can 
be dangerous, the Court has ruled that if police offi cers 
perceive danger during routine traffi c stops, they can 
order drivers and passengers from the car and conduct 
a limited search of their person to ensure police offi cer 
safety.52 Limits on passenger searches were explored in 
Brendlin v. California. Police had stopped a car to check 
its registration and found that a passenger, Brendlin, 
was a parole violator. 53 The offi cers arrested him, 
searched him, and found narcotics. The driver was also 
arrested after a pat-down search revealed contraband, 
and the car was then searched and methamphetamine 
paraphernalia discovered. When Brendlin challenged 
the car search, seeking to have the evidence excluded, 
the U.S. Supreme Court held that Brendlin was seized 
by the police and that passengers as well as drivers 
could be seized for the purpose of a search.
Consent search. 
 
■
People and their property may be 
searched without a warrant if they willingly consent 
to the search. However, for the search to be legal, the 
consent must be given voluntarily; threat or compulsion 
invalidates the search.54 Police are under no obligation 
to inform individuals of their right to refuse the search. 
Police do not have to tell motorists they have stopped 
for a traffi c violation that they are actually free to go 
before asking permission to search the car.55 Courts 
invalidate hundreds of consent searches each year, 
typically when the defendant claims police coercion 
and the reviewing magistrate fi nds evidence of police 
misconduct.56
Second party consent
 
■
. Can a person give consent for 
someone else? In United States v. Matlock, the Court 
ruled that it was permissible for one co-occupant of an 
apartment to give consent to the police to search the 
premises in the absence of the other occupant, as long 
as the person giving consent shares common authority 
over the property and no present co-tenant objects.57 
What happens if one party gives consent to a search 
while another interested party refuses? This is what 
happened in the 2006 case of Georgia v. Randolph. Po-
lice were called to Scott Randolph’s home because of a 
domestic dispute. His wife told police that Randolph 
had been using a lot of cocaine and that drugs were on 
the premises. One offi cer asked Randolph if he could 
conduct a search of the home, and Randolph said no. 
Another offi cer asked his wife for permission, and she 
not only said yes, but also led the offi cer upstairs to a 
bedroom where he allegedly found cocaine residue. The 
Supreme Court held that because Randolph was pres-
ent when the police came to his home, the police were 
required by the Fourth Amendment to heed his objec-
tion, and the search and the seizure of the drugs was 
ruled illegal.58
Plain view. 
 
■
Contraband can be seized without a warrant 
if it is plain view. For example, if a police offi cer looks 
through a fence and sees marijuana growing in a sus-
pect’s fi elds, no search warrant is needed for the prop-
erty to be seized.59
Seizure of nonphysical evidence. 
 
■
Police can seize nonphys-
ical evidence, such as a conversation, if the suspects 
had no reason to expect privacy—for example, if police 
overhear and record a conversation in which two peo-
ple conspire to kill a third party.60
Hot pursuit/exigency. 
 
■
Police may conduct a warrantless 
search during emergency situations, such as when they 
are in hot pursuit of a dangerous suspect. In Kirk v. 
Louisiana, the Supreme Court placed limits on this tac-
tic. Police offi cers observed Kirk engaging in what they 
considered to be drug deals. Without a warrant, they 
entered his home, arrested him, frisked him, found a 
drug vial in his underwear, and seized contraband that 
was in plain view in the apartment. The Supreme Court 
ruled that police offi cers need either a warrant or prob-
able cause plus exigent circumstances in order to make 
a lawful entry into a home. Merely observing a suspect 
committing what appears to be a nonviolent crime is 
not enough of an emergency to justify a warrantless 
 entry of a person’s home.61
In recent years, the Court has given police greater lati-
tude to search for and seize evidence and has eased restric-
tions on how police operate. For example, in the 2009 case 
Herring v. United States, offi cers searched Herring based on 
a warrant listed in a neighboring county’s database. Unbe-
knownst to them, the warrant had been recalled months 
earlier.62 The Supreme Court sanctioned the search and fur-
ther noted that the exclusionary rule will only be violated 
when there is “systemic error or reckless disregard of con-
stitutional requirements.”63 Legal controls of police behavior 
are the subject of the Thinking Like a Criminologist feature.
CHANGING THE POLICE ROLE
Unlike their fi ctional counterparts, contemporary police of-
fi cers do not spend their time in car chases and shootouts. 
James Q. Wilson’s pioneering work, Varieties of Police Behav-
ior, viewed the major police role as “handling the situation.”64 
Wilson found that police encounter many troubling incidents 
that need some sort of “fi xing up.” Enforcing the law might be 
one tool a police offi cer uses; threat, coercion, sympathy, and

592  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
A federal appellate judge asks your opinion about 
a tricky case. It seems that at 3 A.M. the local po-
lice were called about a loud party. When they 
arrived, they heard shouting inside, proceeded 
down the driveway, and saw two juveniles drink-
ing beer in the backyard. Entering the yard, 
they saw through a screen door and windows 
an altercation in the kitchen between four 
adults and a juvenile, who punched one of the 
adults, causing him to spit blood in a sink. A police  officer 
opened the screen door and announced his presence. Without a 
search warrant, the officer entered the kitchen and again cried out, 
whereupon the altercation gradually subsided. The officers arrested 
the adults and charged them with contributing to the delinquency 
of a minor and related offenses. However, the trial court granted the 
defendants’ motion to suppress all evidence obtained after the of-
ficers entered the home on the grounds that the warrantless entry 
violated the Fourth Amendment. According to state and federal law, 
one exigency eliminating the need for a search warrant is the need 
to render emergency assistance to occupants 
of private property who are seriously injured 
or threatened with such injury. However, the 
trial judge concluded that the juvenile’s punch 
was insufficient to trigger the “emergency aid 
doctrine” because it did not give rise to an ob-
jectively reasonable belief that an unconscious, 
semiconscious, or missing person feared injured 
or dead was in the home. Furthermore, the judge 
suggested the doctrine was inapplicable because 
the officers had not sought to assist the injured adult but had acted 
exclusively in a law enforcement capacity.

fi
understanding might be others. Most important is “keeping 
things under control so that there are no complaints that he is 
doing nothing or that he is doing too much.”
The peacekeeping role of the police has been docu-
mented by several different studies that find that police 
function essentially as order-keeping, dispute-settling agents 
of public health and safety.65 Research shows that relatively 
few contacts with police and the public involve physical 
force, but there seem to be racial and ethnic differences in 
the rate at which force is applied.66
As the police enter the new millennium, there have been 
some significant changes in the way they carry out their 
mission. Since police departments are independent entities, 
each is free to choose new models, maintain traditional po-
licing, or try a combination of styles. In the following sec-
tions, a few of the new models are discussed in some detail.
Community-Oriented Policing (COP)
In a highly regarded article, “Broken Windows: The Police 
and Neighborhood Safety,” criminologists James Q. Wil-
son and George Kelling called for a return to a nineteenth-
century style of community-oriented policing (COP)
in which police maintained a presence in the community, 
walked beats, got to know citizens, and inspired feelings of 
public safety.67 They used the term broken windows to signify 
that a community with empty lots, garbage-strewn streets, 
and deteriorated homes—that is, with broken windows—is 
a magnet for crime. Wilson and Kelling asked police admin-
istrators to get their offi cers out of depersonalizing patrol 
cars. Instead of deploying police on the basis of crime rates 
or in areas where citizens make the most calls for help, po-
lice administrators should station their offi cers where they 
can do the most to promote public confidence and elicit 
citizen cooperation. Community preservation, public safety, 
and order maintenance—not crime fighting—should be-
come the primary focus of police. Implied in the Wilson and 
Kelling model was a proactive police role. Instead of merely 
responding to calls for help (known as reactive policing), 
police should play an active role in the community, identify 
neighborhood problems and needs, and set a course of ac-
tion for an effective response. Wilson and Kelling conclude:
Just as physicians now recognize the importance of 
fostering health rather than simply treating illness, so 
the police—and the rest of us—ought to recognize the 
importance of maintaining intact communities without 
broken windows.68
The “broken windows” article had an important impact 
on policing, and since its publication, there has been a con-
tinuing reanalysis of the police role.
Community Policing in Action The federal govern-
ment has encouraged the growth of community policing 
by providing millions of dollars to hire and train offi cers.69
Hundreds of communities have adopted innovative forms 
of decentralized, neighborhood-based community policing

models. Recent surveys indicate that there has been a sig-
nifi cant increase in community policing activities in recent 
years and that certain core programs such as crime preven-
tion activities have become embedded in the police role.70
COP programs have been implemented in large cities, 
suburban areas, and rural communities.71 Some COP pro-
grams assign offi cers to neighborhoods, organize training 
programs for community leaders, and feature a bottom-up 
approach to dealing with community problems: decision 
making involves the officer on the scene, not a directive 
from central headquarters. Some departments have created 
programs for juveniles such as neighborhood cleanup ef-
forts, whereas others contact local businesspeople and com-
munity groups to get them involved in planning.72
To achieve the goals of COP, some agencies have tried to 
decentralize, an approach sometimes referred to as neighbor-
hood policing. Problems are best solved at the neighborhood 
level where issues originate, not at a far-off central head-
quarters. Because each neighborhood has its own particular 
needs, police decision making must be fl exible and adaptive. 
For example, neighborhoods undergoing change in racial 
composition often experience high levels of racially mo-
tivated violence.73 Police must be able to distinguish these 
neighborhoods and allocate resources to meet their needs.
Because COP also stresses sharing power with local 
groups and individuals, neighborhood initiatives may be an 
ideal way to fi ght crime. Citizens actively participate with 
police to fi ght crime, for example, by providing information 
in area crime investigations or helping police reach out to 
troubled area youths. Police in Houston adopted the Posi-
tive Interaction Program, in which captains in each of the 
city’s nine (decentralized) substations were required to meet 
monthly with area business leaders and prominent residents 
to discuss neighborhood problems. Substation captains 
were then charged with using available resources to resolve 
the problems.74 Exhibit 17.4 elaborates on the elements of 
community-oriented policing.
Problem-Oriented Policing
According to police expert Herman Goldstein, police de-
partments have been too concerned with internal effi ciency 
and have therefore given insuffi cient attention to substantive 
problems in the work environment.75 Police have been reac-
tive, responding to calls for help. Instead they should play an 
active role in identifying particular community problems—
street-level drug dealers, prostitution rings, gang hangouts—
and developing strategies to counteract them. This aggressive 
strategy is referred to as problem-oriented policing (POP).
According to POP, problems are better defined nar-
rowly; the focus should be on reducing larceny at the mall 
on weekends, not a general reduction in the crime rate. 
Solutions draw on the creative talents found in two impor-
tant resources: the community and the line offi cers who are 
familiar with community problems.76 Rather than stifl e or

594  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
however. Problem-oriented policing puts problem identifi ca-
tion and solutions in the hands of individual street-level offi cers. 
In contrast, ILP emphasizes a top-down managerial approach 
by which administrators set priorities for crime prevention and 
enforcement and then pass these priorities down through the 
agency.82 ILP is also similar to community policing in the sense 
that it relies on residents as part of the intelligence-gathering 
process. It is different, though, because while community po-
licing emphasizes the desires of the community, intelligence-
led policing relies on problem identifi cation through careful 
analysis of the criminal environment as a whole.
Here are examples of the forms that ILP currently takes:
A county sheriff’s offi ce identifi es narcotics control as 
 
■
its top priority and develops strategies accordingly. The 
offi ce targets known offenders and groups, shuts down 
open-air drug markets and crack houses, and partici-
pates in school-based drug awareness programs to help 
prevent drug use.
A statewide agency identifi es vehicle insurance fraud 
 
■
as a top area for enforcement. The agency targets those 
involved in staged accidents, identifi es communities 
in which insurance fraud is prevalent, indicates ongo-
ing fraudulent activity, and mounts a public education 
campaign.
A police agency in a small city makes safe streets a 
 
■
priority. The agency focuses on directed enforcement 
in identifi ed hotspots. It also targets career criminals 
whose apprehension will signifi cantly reduce the num-
ber of crimes being committed. Preventive measures 
include enhanced patrols, improved street lighting, and 
crime watch programs.83
Fusion Centers
A number of states and large cities have formed fusion centers, 
in order to “exchange information and intelligence, maximize 
resources, streamline operations, and improve the ability to 
fi ght crime and terrorism by analyzing data from a variety of 
sources.”84 Often located in police departments, these cen-
ters are set up for the purpose of sharing information and 
intelligence within specifi c jurisdictions and across levels of 
government. Fusion centers often emphasize terrorism pre-
vention and crime fi ghting with extensive use of technology. 
They frequently resemble a department’s technological “nerve 
center” and are usually housed in a central location where in-
formation is collected and then shared with decision makers. 
There are four main goals for fusion centers:
Support for a range of law enforcement activities, in-
 
■
cluding anticrime operations and terrorism prevention
Help for major incident operations and support for units 
 
■
charged with interdiction and criminal investigations
Providing the means for community input, often 
 
■
through tip lines
Assistance to law enforcement executives so they can 
 
■
make informed decisions about departmental priorities85
control creativity, problem-oriented policing encourages 
new solutions to old problems. Problem-oriented strategies 
are being developed that focus on specifi c criminal prob-
lem areas, specifi c criminal acts, or both. They have proven 
both popular and effective in combating a range of ongoing 
criminal activities. Take car theft for example.

CourseMate at cengagebrain.com, then access the “Web 
Links” for this chapter.
Because of problem-oriented approaches (combined with 
advanced technology), car thieves in many jurisdictions are 
no longer able to steal cars with as much ease as before. To 
reduce the high number of car thefts occurring each year, 
some police departments have invested in bait cars, which are 
parked in high-theft areas and equipped with technology that 
alerts law enforcement personnel when someone has stolen 
the vehicle. A signal goes off when either a door is opened 
or the engine starts. Then, equipped with global positioning 
satellite (GPS) technology, police offi cers can watch the move-
ment of the car. Some cars are also equipped with micro-
scopic videos and audio recorders, which allow offi cers to see 
and hear the suspect(s) within the car, and remote engine and 
door locks, which can trap the thief inside. The technology 
has been used in conjunction with an advertising campaign 
to warn potential car thieves about the program. The system 
has been instituted in several cities, with impressive results.
Although there are formidable obstacles to overcome, 
growing evidence suggests that community- and problem-
oriented policing can work and fit well with traditional 
forms of policing.77 Community policing efforts have been 
credited with helping reduce crime rates in large cities such 
as New York and Boston. The most professional and highly 
motivated offi cers are the ones most likely to support com-
munity policing efforts.78
Intelligence-Led Policing
Intelligence-led policing (ILP) refers to the collection and 
analysis of information to produce informed police decision 
making at both the tactical and strategic levels.79 It empha-
sizes information-sharing, collaboration, and strategic solu-
tions to crime problems at various levels.80
ILP relies heavily on:
Confi dential informants
 
■
Offender interviews
 
■
Careful analysis of crime reports and calls for service
 
■
Suspect surveillance
 
■
Community sources of information
 
■
81
Intelligence-led policing bears a great deal of similarity to 
problem-oriented policing. The two are somewhat different,

similar crimes could receive highly dissimilar treatment. For 
example, most people convicted of homicide receive a prison 
sentence, but about 4 percent receive probation as a sole sen-
tence. More murderers get probation than the death penalty.87
We will now review some of the institutions and pro-
cesses involved in adjudication and trial. First the court 
structure is briefl y reviewed. Then actors in the process—
prosecution, defense, judges, and juries—are discussed. 
The pretrial stage of the justice process is the next focus of 
attention, as such issues as bail and plea bargaining are de-
scribed. The criminal trial is then discussed in some detail.
COURT STRUCTURE
Criminal adjudication is played out within the court system. 
The most important of the nation’s 16,000 courts are orga-
nized on the state and federal levels.
State Courts
The typical state court structure is illustrated in Figure 17.2. 
Most states employ a multitiered court structure. Lower 
courts try misdemeanors and conduct the preliminary pro-
cessing of felony offenses. Superior trial courts try felony 
cases. Appellate courts review the criminal procedures of 
trial courts to determine whether the offenders were treated 
fairly. Superior appellate courts or state supreme courts re-
view lower appellate court decisions.
Federal Courts
The federal court system has three tiers, as shown in 
 Figure 17.3. The U.S. district courts are the trial courts 
of the system; they have jurisdiction over cases involving 
violations of federal law, such as interstate transportation of 
stolen vehicles and racketeering.
Appeals from the district court are heard in one of the 
intermediate federal courts of appeal. However, the high-
est federal appeals court, the U.S. Supreme Court, is the 
court of last resort for all cases tried in the various federal 
and state courts.
The Supreme Court is composed of nine members, ap-
pointed for lifetime terms by the president with the approval 
of Congress. In general, the Court hears only cases it deems 
important and appropriate. When the Court decides to hear 
a case, it usually grants a writ of certiorari, requesting a 
transcript of the case proceedings for review.
The Supreme Court can word a decision so that it becomes 
a precedent that must be honored by all lower courts. For ex-
ample, if the Court grants a particular litigant the right to coun-
sel at a police lineup, then all people in similar situations must 
Fusion centers are intended to provide a mechanism 
through which government agencies, law enforcement, and 
the private sector can work together for the common pur-
pose of protecting the homeland and preserving public safety. 
They are premised on a model of collaboration. Collaboration 
between agencies and across levels of government has been 
lacking throughout history, but the events of 9/11 affi rmed a 
need for change. The fusion center concept will continue to 
catch on and, in all likelihood, more will be developed as law 
enforcement comes to realize the benefi ts they can yield.
THE ADJUDICATION PROCESS
If the police are able to identify and arrest a criminal sus-
pect, the focus of the justice system then turns to the court 
system, where the adjudication process unfolds.
The adjudication process is complex. It must provide 
fair, impartial justice in deciding the outcome of a confl ict 
between criminal and victim, law enforcement agents and 
violators of the law, parent and child, federal government 
and violators of governmental regulations, or other parties. 
Regardless of the issues involved, all parties involved are 
guaranteed that they will have a hearing conducted under 
rules of procedure in an atmosphere of fair play and objec-
tivity and that the outcome of the hearing will be clear. If a 
party believes that the ground rules have been violated, he 
or she may take the case to a higher court, where the pro-
cedures of the original trial will be examined. If it fi nds that 
a violation of legal rights has occurred, the appellate court 
may deem the fi ndings of the original trial improper and 
either order a new hearing or hold that some other measure 
must be carried out; for example, the court may dismiss the 
charge outright. An erroneous judgment can devastate peo-
ple’s lives. Because of fears that the court process can result 
in wrongful convictions, there have been ongoing efforts by 
independent groups to review case outcomes and determine 
if a miscarriage of justice has taken place.86
The court is a complex social agency with many inde-
pendent but interrelated subsystems—clerk, prosecutor, 
defense attorney, judge, and probation department—each 
having a role in the court’s operation. It is also the scene of 
many important elements of criminal justice decision mak-
ing—detention, jury selection, trial, and sentencing.
Ideally, the judicatory process operates with absolute fair-
ness and equality. The entire process—from fi ling the initial 
complaint to fi nal sentencing of the defendant—is governed 
by precise rules of law designed to ensure fairness. No defen-
dant tried before a U.S. court should suffer or benefi t because 
of his or her personal characteristics, beliefs, or affi liations.
However, U.S. criminal justice can be selective. Discretion 
accompanies defendants through every step of the process, de-
termining what will happen to them and how their cases will 
be resolved. Discretion means that two people committing

Court Overcrowding
The vast U.S. court system has been overloaded by the mil-
lions of cases that are brought each year. State court systems 
now handle more than 100 million new cases annually. That 
total includes the following:
About 23 million civil and domestic cases
 
■
More than 21 million criminal cases
 
■
be given the same right. This type of ruling is usually referred 
to as a landmark decision. The use of precedent in the legal 
system gives the Supreme Court power to infl uence and mold 
the everyday operating procedures of police agencies, trial 
courts, and corrections institutions. This infl uence was quite 
pronounced during the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren, 
who, during the 1960s, greatly amplified and extended the 
power of the Court to affect criminal justice policies.
Probate Court*
Some states call it surrogate court. 
This special court handles wills, 
administration of estates, and 
guardianship of minors and 
incompetents.
State Supreme Court
Court of final resort. Some states call 
it court of appeals, supreme judicial 
court, or supreme court of appeals. 
Oklahoma and Texas have two courts 
of last resort, one for civil matters and 
one for criminal.
Superior Court
Highest trial court with general juris-
diction. Some states call it circuit 
court, district court, or court of com-
mon pleas; in New York, it is called 
supreme court.
Lower Court*
These courts, sometimes called 
common pleas or district courts, have 
limited jurisdiction in both civil and 
criminal cases.
Justice of the Peace**
and Police Magistrate
Lowest courts in judicial hierarchy. 
Limited in jurisdiction in both civil and 
criminal cases.
Intermediate Appellate Courts
Only 39 states have intermediate 
appellate courts, which are an 
intermediate tribunal between the trial 
court and the court of final resort. A 
majority of cases are decided finally 
by these appellate courts. Four states 
have two intermediate appellate 
courts.
Municipal Court*
In some cities, it is customary to have 
less important cases tried by munici-
pal magistrates.
Domestic Relations Court
Also called family court or juvenile 
court.
Specialty Courts
Drug courts
Gun courts
FIGURE 17.2 
Structure of a State Judicial Court
*Courts of special jurisdiction, such as probate, family, or juvenile courts, and the so-called inferior courts, such as common pleas or municipal courts, may 
be separate courts or part of the trial court of general jurisdiction.
**Justices of the peace do not exist in all states. Where do they exist, their jurisdictions vary greatly from state to state.

process as a means of redressing all kinds of personal

The number of criminal cases brought to court has 
trended upward over the past decade even though crime

the judge.

The number of cases in all state courts, especially lim-
ited jurisdiction courts, has been increasing at a steady pace 
for more than a decade. The result is congestion that is both 
expensive and legally undesirable: it is costly to jail criminal 
defendants who cannot make bail; court delays violate the 
Sixth Amendment’s right to a speedy trial.
Why has the court system become so congested? There 
are numerous factors that produce trial delay and court 
congestion:89

Nevada, have outpaced growth in the court system.

crimes such as panhandling or vagrancy.
As the law becomes more complex, and involves such

technological issues as intellectual property rights con-
cerning computer programs, the need for a more in-
volved court process has escalated.
Ironically, efforts being made to reform the criminal

law may also be helping to overload the courts. The 
increase of mandatory prison sentences for some crimes 
may reduce the use of plea bargaining and increase the 
number of jury trials because defendants fear that a

598  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Prosecutor
The prosecution represents the state in criminal matters 
that come before the courts. The prosecutor’s major duties 
are listed in Exhibit 17.5. There are now almost 2,500 state 
court prosecutors’ offi ces, employing nearly 80,000 attor-
neys, investigators, and support staff.91
Prosecutors’ jobs are changing with the times as they 
confront new crime patterns and become more sensitive to 
old ones. Not only must the prosecutor deal with murder, 
rape, and robbery, but he or she must also confront identity 
theft, etailing fraud, and cyberbullies.
Types of Prosecutors In the federal system, the chief pros-
ecuting offi cer is the U.S. attorney general; his or her assistant 
prosecutors are known as U.S. attorneys and are appointed 
by the president. They represent the government in federal 
district courts. The chief prosecutor is usually an adminis-
trator; assistants normally handle the actual preparation and 
ACTORS IN THE JUDICATORY 
PROCESS
The judge, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney are 
the key players in the adversarial process. The prosecu-
tion and defense oppose each other in a hotly disputed 
contest—the criminal trial—in accordance with rules of 
law and procedure. In every criminal case, the prosecutor 
represents the state’s interests and the defense attorney the 
criminal defendant’s, with each side trying to bring evidence 
and arguments forward to advance its case. Theoretically, 
the ultimate objective of the adversarial system is to seek the 
truth, to determine whether the evidence presented at the 
trial is suffi cient to prove the facts of the charge. So that the 
defendant is given a fair trial, the judge acts as an impartial 
arbiter of procedure, ensuring that neither side violates the 
rules of trial conduct.
EXHIBIT 17.5 
The Role of the Prosecutor
Investigating law violations. 
 
■
Prosecutors are empowered to 
conduct their own investigations into alleged violations of 
the law. In some jurisdictions, they maintain a staff of detec-
tives and investigators; in others they rely on local or state 
police. In jurisdictions with grand jury systems, the prosecu-
tor can convene the grand jury to collect information and 
interview witnesses for the purpose of accumulating enough 
evidence to indict suspects in criminal conspiracies.
Cooperating with police. 
 
■
The prosecutor’s office usually 
works closely with police agencies. Police prepare the in-
vestigation report of a crime according to the format desired 
by the prosecutor’s office. Prosecutors also advise police 
agents about the legal issues in a given case. For example, 
they supervise the drawing up of requests (affidavits) for 
search warrants and then make sure that the police un-
derstand the limitations presented by the warrant. Some 
prosecutor’s offices help train police officers, making them 
aware of the legal issues involved in securing a warrant or a 
legal arrest, interrogating a suspect, and so on.
Determining charges. 
 
■
The prosecutor determines the 
charges to be brought against the suspect. The charge on 
which defendants are brought to trial may not resemble the 
original reasons they were arrested. For example, a suspect 
picked up for disorderly conduct may later be identified in a 
police lineup as the perpetrator of a string of liquor store rob-
beries. The disorderly conduct charge may then be dropped 
in favor of prosecution on the more serious robbery charges.
Representing the government in pretrial hearings and mo-
 
■
tions. The prosecutor brings the case to trial. Prosecutors 
contact witnesses and prepare them to testify, secure physical 
evidence, and discuss the victim’s testimony. If the defendant 
attempts to have evidence suppressed at a pretrial hearing 
(for example, because of violations of the exclusionary rule), 
the prosecutor represents the state’s position on the matter.
Plea bargaining. 
 
■
The prosecutor is empowered to negotiate 
a guilty plea with the defendant, thereby ending the formal 
trial process.
Trying criminal cases. 
 
■
The prosecutor acts as the state’s at-
torney at criminal trials. Consequently, another name for the 
prosecutor is people’s attorney.
Sentencing. 
 
■
The prosecutor recommends dispositions at the 
completion of the trial. Usually, the type of sentence recom-
mended is influenced by plea bargaining cooperation, public 
opinion, the seriousness of the crime, the offender’s prior 
record, and other factors related to the case.
Representing the government at appeals. 
 
■
If the defendant is 
found guilty as charged, he or she may appeal the convic-
tion before a higher court. The prosecutor represents the 
government at these hearings.
Conducting special investigations. 
 
■
Some jurisdictions em-
power special prosecutors to seek indictments for serious 
crimes considered important to the public interest. This 
practice became well known during the Watergate investiga-
tion, when first Archibald Cox and then Leon Jaworski were 
appointed as special prosecutors to investigate the break-
ins and subsequent cover-up. In recent years, Kenneth 
Starr served as an independent counsel investigating the 
Clinton presidency.

cases themselves. The job is stressful because of both work 
pressure and the danger of the job. Almost half of all pros-
ecutors’ offi ces indicate that a staff member experienced a 
work-related threat or assault.92
Prosecutorial Discretion Prosecutors maintain broad 
discretion in the exercise of their duties. One major decision 
involves the choice of acting on the information brought by 
police or deciding to drop the case without further action. 
The prosecutor can also attempt to prosecute and then de-
cide to drop the case; this is known as a nolle prosequi. An 
example of a high-profi le case in which a prosecutor, after 
examining the evidence, decided to drop the charges is dis-
cussed in the Profi les in Crime feature.
The courts have protected prosecutors’ right to exercise 
discretion over legal case processing; their discretionary 
judgments can only be questioned if a defendant can prove 
that the prosecutor let discrimination guide his or her deci-
sion making.93
About half of all arrests are dismissed before they reach 
the trial stage. Some are diverted into treatment programs; 
trial work. Federal prosecutors are professional civil service 
employees with reasonable salaries and job security.
Offi ce titles for state court prosecutors include district 
attorney, county attorney, prosecuting attorney, common-
wealth attorney, and state’s attorney. These attorneys are typ-
ically elected offi cials. Again, most criminal prosecution and 
staff work is performed by scores of full-time and part-time 
attorneys, police investigators, and clerical personnel. Most 
attorneys who work for prosecutors at state and county lev-
els are political appointees who earn low salaries, handle 
many cases, and in some jurisdictions, maintain private law 
practices. Many young lawyers serve in this capacity to gain 
trial experience, then leave for better-paying positions. In 
some state, county, and municipal jurisdictions, however, 
the offi ce of the prosecutor can be described as meeting the 
highest standards of professional skill, personal integrity, 
and working conditions.
In urban settings, the structure of the district attorney’s 
offi ce is often specialized, with separate divisions for felo-
nies, misdemeanors, and trial and appeal assignments. In 
rural offi ces, chief prosecutors handle many of the criminal 
1 A.M., Roethlisberger and friends took over 
the bar’s makeshift VIP room, and invited 
the women in for shots of alcohol.
Roethlisberger struck up a conversation 
with one woman and around 2 A.M. they dis-
appeared into a small bathroom within the 
VIP area. According to the victim, Roethlis-
berger began to make advances despite her 
repeatedly telling him that she did not want 
to have sex and forced her into the dark 
confines of the restroom. At first, the alleged 
victim, whom the D.A. said was “highly in-
toxicated,” claimed she wasn’t raped and 
when she was asked if she had sex, she 
said she wasn’t sure. Later, in a handwritten 
statement, she said she did have noncon-
sensual sex with Roethlisberger. She made 
this statement: “I told him it wasn’t okay . . 
. I proceeded to get up and try to leave. He 
followed me into the bathroom. He then had 
sex with me. He said it was okay.”
In the end, prosecutor Fred Bright de-
cided not to press charges because of the 
lack of definitive physical evidence, the fail-
ure of police to secure the crime scene, and 
the hazy testimony given by the parties in-
volved. The accuser also asked him to drop 
the case. Her attorney gave this statement: 
“What is obvious in looking forward is that a 
criminal trial would be a very intrusive per-
sonal experience for a complainant in this 
situation, given the extraordinary media at-
tention that would be inevitable. As should 
be clear from what I said here, this decision 
does not reflect any recanting of our client’s 
complaint, but simply a realistic, personal 
decision as to what is in her best interests, 
and what it would be like to go through a 
trial with the expected media attention.”
Despite avoiding criminal charges, Ro-
ethlisberger was suspended for four games.

Referral for other prosecution. 
 
■
When there are other of-
fenses, perhaps of a more serious nature, in a different 
jurisdiction, or deferring to a federal prosecution.
A plea or cooperation on another case. 
 
■
When the accused 
agrees to serve as a witness in another case. The accused 
may also be charged in several cases and the prosecutor 
agrees to drop one or more of the cases in exchange for 
a plea of guilty in one of them.
Pretrial diversion. 
 
■
Agreeing to drop charges when the ac-
cused successfully meets the conditions for diversion, 
such as completion of a treatment program.98
Prosecutors in large counties are less likely to bring felons 
to trial than those in smaller, less crime-ridden counties. Ju-
risdictions in which prosecutors are forced to deal with more 
serious, violent felonies are also the ones in which the most 
selectivity is used.99 Prosecutors are political creatures. While 
they are charged with serving the people, they also must be 
wary of their reputations; losing too many high profi le cases 
may jeopardize their chances of reelection. They therefore 
may be unwilling to prosecute cases in which the odds of 
conviction are low; they are worried about convictability.100
One way to combat this use of discretion or to shape 
prosecution has been the adoption of “no-drop prosecution” 
policies, also called “evidence-based” prosecution. These pol-
icies require prosecutors to bring charges against a particular 
type of criminal, such as domestic abusers, even if the victim 
refuses to participate. Calling them “evidence-based” means 
that if there is enough evidence, even without the victim’s 
testimony (e.g., police reports, accounts of witnesses), the 
prosecutor will bring charges. No-drop prosecution policies 
have caught on despite the fact that there is little empirical 
evidence that they reduce recidivism or lower crime rates.101
If too successful, lobbying efforts may dilute resources 
and overextend the prosecutor’s offi ce. When prosecutors 
in Milwaukee substantially increased the prosecution of do-
mestic violence cases, the time taken to process the cases 
doubled, convictions declined, pretrial crime increased, and 
victim satisfaction with the justice process declined.102
Defense Attorney
While representing the accused in the criminal process, the 
defense counsel performs many functions (Exhibit 17.6). 
The lawyer whose practice involves a substantial propor-
tion of criminal cases is often considered a specialist in the 
fi eld. And there is little question that having a preeminent 
private attorney can help clients prove their innocence. Just 
ask O. J. Simpson, who was represented by the late Johnny 
Cochran, one of the nation’s best-known attorneys. Recent 
research by Talia Roitberg Harmon and William Lofquist 
found that having a competent private attorney who puts 
on a rigorous defense is the single most important factor 
separating those exonerated in murder cases and those who 
are executed.103
others are rejected after being screened by the prosecutor; 
and another group is dealt with in lower court by either dis-
missal or misdemeanor conviction.
By effectively screening out cases in which conviction 
could not reasonably be expected—cases inappropriate for 
criminal action (such as minor thefts by fi rst offenders) and 
cases involving offenders with special needs (such as the 
emotionally disturbed or mentally retarded)—the prosecu-
tor can concentrate on bringing to trial those who commit 
more serious criminal offenses. The relatively few cases that 
do get to trial are most often settled through plea negotia-
tions conducted by the prosecutor’s offi ce.
Factors Influencing Decision Making Research indicates 
that widely varied factors infl uence prosecutorial discretion 
in invoking criminal sanctions, including the character-
istics of the crime, the criminal, and the victim. As might 
be expected, prosecutors are much more likely to use their 
discretion in minor incidents than they are in more serious 
ones. Recent research by John Worrall and his associates 
found that case seriousness shapes prosecutorial discretion 
in domestic violence cases: offenders were more likely to 
be charged if the victim was seriously injured in the assault 
than in cases without serious injury or where both parties 
seemed to be at fault.94
An offender who maintains undesirable personal char-
acteristics such as a long history of drug abuse and criminal 
offending or who uses extreme and unnecessary violence 
will more likely be prosecuted than one who is a fi rst of-
fender, does not use drugs, and does not seriously injure a 
victim.95 The effect of race on prosecutorial decision mak-
ing is uncertain. Although some research efforts have found 
that the race of the offender or victim infl uences prosecu-
torial discretion, others show that decisions are relatively 
unbiased.96
In some instances, the victim’s own behavior may infl u-
ence charging decisions. Victim cooperation is a key factor 
in the decision to prosecute cases; the odds of a case being 
prosecuted is seven times greater when prosecutors consid-
ered a victim to be cooperative.97 Among the other reasons 
cases are dropped include:
Insuffi cient evidence. 
 
■
A failure to fi nd suffi cient physical 
evidence linking the defendant to the offense.
Witness problems. 
 
■
For example, when a witness fails 
to appear, gives unclear or inconsistent statements, is 
reluctant to testify, or is unsure of the identity of the of-
fender, or when a prior relationship exists between the 
victim or witness and the offender.
The interests of justice. 
 
■
Deciding not to prosecute certain 
types of offenses, particularly those that violate the let-
ter but not the spirit of the law (for example, offenses 
involving insignifi cant amounts of property damage).
Due process problems. 
 
■
Violations of the constitutional 
requirements for seizing evidence and for questioning 
the accused.

CHAPTER 17 | Police and the Courts: Investigation, Arrest, and Adjudication  601
While a lucky few defendants are able to afford the ser-
vices of a skilled and experienced private counsel, the ma-
jority of criminal defendants are indigent people who cannot 
afford legal counsel. The Supreme Court has interpreted the 
Sixth Amendment of the Constitution to mean that people 
facing trial for offenses that can be punished by incarcera-
tion have the right to legal counsel.104 If they cannot afford 
counsel, the state must provide an attorney free of charge. 
Consequently, three systems—public defender, assigned 
counsel, and contract—have been developed to provide le-
gal counsel to the indigent (Exhibit 17.7).
These three systems can be used independently or in 
combination.105 For example, in Maine the majority of the 
indigent criminal defense services are provided through an 
assigned counsel system. Oregon primarily uses a system 
of awarded contracts. Minnesota and New Mexico do not 
have assigned counsel programs but instead rely on state-
wide public defender and contract attorney systems.106 
In general, the attorney list/assigned counsel system is used 
in less populated areas, where case fl ow is minimal and a 
full-time public defender is not needed. Public defenders 
are usually found in larger urban areas with high case fl ow 
rates. So although a proportionately larger area of the coun-
try is served by the assigned counsel system, a signifi cant 
proportion of criminal defendants receive public defenders. 
Public defenders can be part of a statewide agency, county 
government, the judiciary, or an independent nonprofi t or-
ganization or other institution.
Conflicts of Defense Because of how the U.S. system of 
justice operates today, criminal defense attorneys face many 
role confl icts. They are viewed as prime movers in what is

essentially an adversarial process: the prosecution and the 
defense fight over the facts of the case at hand, with the 
prosecutor arguing the case for the state and the defense 
counsel using all possible means to aid the client.
However, as members of the legal profession, defense at-
torneys must be aware of their role as offi cers of the court. 
As an attorney, the defense counsel is obligated to uphold 
the integrity of the legal profession and to observe the re-
quirements of the Code of Professional Responsibility of 
the American Bar Association in the defense of a client. The 
code makes the following statement regarding the duties of 
the lawyer in the adversary system of justice:
Our legal system provides for the adjudication of dis-
putes governed by the rules of substantive, evidentiary, 
and procedural law. An adversary presentation counters 
the natural human tendency to judge too swiftly in 
terms of the familiar that which is not yet fully known; 
the advocate, by his zealous preparation of facts and 
law, enables the tribunal to come to the hearing with an 
open and neutral mind and to render impartial judg-
ments. The duty of a lawyer to his client and his duty to 
the legal system are the same: To present his client zeal-
ously within the boundaries of the law.107
In this dual capacity of being both a defensive advocate 
and an offi cer of the court, the attorney often faces confl ict-
ing obligations to client and profession. In general, there is 
no obligation on the defense attorney’s part to disclose client 
confessions—or guilt in the absence of a confession.108 How-
ever, defense attorneys are prohibited from knowingly allow-
ing their clients to take the stand and offer perjured (false) 
testimony. For example, if a defense attorney knows her

citizen might suspect. During trials, the judge rules on the 
appropriateness of conduct, settles questions of evidence and 
procedure, and guides the questioning of witnesses. When a 
jury trial occurs, the judge must instruct jury members on 
which evidence can be examined and which should be ig-
nored. The judge also formally charges the jury by instructing 
its members on what points of law and evidence they must 
consider before reaching a decision of guilty or innocent. 
When a jury trial is waived, the judge must decide whether 
the defendant is guilty. Finally, if a defendant is found guilty, 
the judge decides on the sentence (in some cases the sentence 
is legislatively determined). This duty includes choosing the 
type of sentence, its length, and—in the case of probation—
the conditions under which it may be revoked. Obviously, 
this decision has a signifi cant effect on an offender’s future.110
While carrying out their duties, judges must be wary of 
the legal controls placed on the trial process by the appellate 
court system. If an error is made, the judge’s decision may be 
reversed, causing at the minimum personal embarrassment. 
While some experts believe that fear of reversal may shape 
judicial decision making, recent research by David Klein and 
Robert Hume indicates that judges may be more indepen-
dent than previously believed, especially if they can use their 
judicial power as a policy making tool to infl uence important 
social agendas such as affi rmative action or privacy.111
Beyond these stated duties, the trial judge has extensive 
control and infl uence over the other service agencies of the 
court: probation agencies, court clerks, police agencies, and 
the district attorney’s offi ce. Probation and the clerk may be 
under the judge’s explicit control. In some courts, the opera-
tions, philosophy, and procedures of these agencies are within 
the magistrate’s administrative domain. In other courts—for 
example, where a state agency controls the probation depart-
ment—the attitudes of the county or district court judge still 
infl uence how a probation department is run.
Judicial Selection Several methods are used to select 
state court judges. In some jurisdictions, the governor sim-
ply appoints judges. In others, judicial recommendations 
must be confi rmed by the state senate, the governor’s coun-
cil, a special confi rmation committee, an executive council 
elected by the state assembly, or an elected review board. 
Some states employ screening bodies that submit names to 
the governor for approval. Another form of judicial selection 
is through popular election, either partisan or nonpartisan. 
Though this practice is used in a majority of states, there is 
no set procedure, and each state sets its own terms of ap-
pointment. For example, in some states judges are elected 
for 15-year terms while in others the term is 4 years.112
More than 30 states have adopted what is known as the 
Missouri Plan to select judges. This three-part approach con-
sists of (1) a judicial commission to nominate candidates for 
the bench, (2) an elected offi cial (usually from the executive 
branch) to make appointments from the list submitted by the 
commission, and (3) subsequent nonpartisan, noncompetitive 
elections in which incumbent judges run on their records.
client committed the crime, she cannot have the defendant 
take the witness stand and testify that he was not involved.
These issues are sometimes so complex that even the Su-
preme Court has had diffi culty setting standards of proper 
behavior. However, in Nix v. Whiteside, the Court sustained 
an attorney’s right to refuse to represent a client whom he 
suspected would commit perjury. The Court also ruled that 
an attorney’s threat to withdraw from the case and tell the 
court about the perjury did not violate the client’s right to 
competent assistance of counsel.109
Judge
The third major participant in the criminal trial is the judge—
the senior officer in a court of criminal law. Judges’ duties 
are quite varied and are far more extensive than the average 
A judge’s duties may include conducting bench trials during which

by the preliminary hearing during which a judicial offi cer de-
cides whether there is suffi cient evidence to try the accused.
If suffi cient evidence is found in either procedure, the 
accused is brought before the trial court for arraignment, at 
which time the judge informs the defendant of the charge, 
ensures that the accused is properly represented by counsel, 
and determines whether the accused should be released on 
bail or handled in some alternative manner pending a hear-
ing or trial.
The defendant who is arraigned on an indictment or 
information can ordinarily plead guilty, not guilty, or nolo 
contendere, which is equivalent to a guilty plea but cannot 
be used as evidence in subsequent cases. When a guilty plea 
is entered, the defendant admits to all the elements of the 
crime, and the court begins to review the person’s back-
ground for sentencing purposes. A plea of not guilty sets the 
stage for a trial or for plea bargaining between the prosecu-
tor and the defense attorney.
This section reviews in detail two important issues re-
lated to pretrial procedures: bail and plea bargaining.
Bail
Bail represents money or some other security provided to 
the court to ensure the appearance of the defendant at trial. 
The amount of bail is set by a magistrate who reviews the 
facts of the case and the history of the defendant. Defendants 
who cannot afford or who are denied bail are detained, usu-
ally in a county jail or lockup, until their trial date. Those 
who can put up the bail amount are free to pursue their 
defense before trial.
Some states, such as New York and Texas, use different 
methods to select judges on the appellate and trial levels. New 
York appellate court judges are appointed by the governor; 
trial court judges are elected; and criminal court and family 
court judges in New York City are appointed by the mayor.113
Judicial Overload There has been great concern about 
stress placed on judges by case pressure. In most states, 
people appointed to the bench have had little or no training 
in the role of judge. Others may have held administrative 
posts and may not have appeared before a court in years. 
Once they are appointed to the bench, judges are given an 
overwhelming amount of work that has risen dramatically 
over the years. The number of civil and criminal fi lings per 
state court judge has increased signifi cantly since 1985. An-
nually there are more than 1,500 civil and criminal case fi l-
ings per state court judge and 450 per federal judge.114 State 
court judges deal with far more cases, but federal cases may 
be more complex and demand more judicial time. In any 
event, the number of civil and criminal cases, especially in 
state courts, seems to be outstripping the ability of states to 
create new judgeships.
Several agencies have been created to improve the qual-
ity of the judiciary. The National Conference of State Court 
Judges and the National College of Juvenile Justice both oper-
ate judicial training seminars and publish manuals and guides 
on state-of-the-art judicial techniques. Their ongoing efforts 
are designed to improve the quality of the nation’s judges.
Now that the actors in the judicatory process have been 
introduced and the structure within which they work de-
fi ned, our attention will turn to the three main stages of the 
process itself: pretrial procedures, the trial, and sentencing.
PRETRIAL PROCEDURES
After arrest, or if an arrest warrant has been served, a crimi-
nal charge is drawn up by the appropriate prosecutor’s of-
fi ce. The charge is a formal written document identifying 
the criminal activity, the facts of the case, and the circum-
stances of the arrest.
If the crime is a felony, the charge is called a bill of in-
dictment (if it is to be considered by a grand jury) or an 
information (if that particular jurisdiction uses the prelim-
inary hearing system); misdemeanants are charged with a 
complaint.
Some states and the federal government still use the 
grand jury system to weigh evidence before an indictment 
can be issued. This process has been criticized as being a rub-
ber stamp for the prosecution because the presentation of 
the evidence is shaped by the district attorney, who is not re-
quired by law to reveal information that might exonerate the 
accused.115 In other states, the grand jury has been replaced

on $500,000 bail after a judge approved the combination of cash and 
property that Enright’s family put up to free him. Enright claimed the 
attack was caused by his alcoholism as well as PTSD developed while 
he was a filmmaker in Afghanistan.

604  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
if they had not been given discretionary release and instead 
been kept behind bars. Overall, 18 percent of released de-
fendants are rearrested for a new offense allegedly commit-
ted while they awaited disposition of their original case. 
About two-thirds of these defendants, 12 percent of all re-
leased defendants, are charged with a new felony.
In all, about one-third of released defendants are either 
rearrested for a new offense, fail to appear in court as sched-
uled, or commit some other violation that results in the re-
vocation of their pretrial release. Those rearrested tend to 
be on bail longer, have a serious prior record, abuse drugs, 
have a poor work record, and are disproportionately young, 
male, and minority group members.
Bail is also controversial because it penalizes the indigent 
offender who does not have the means to pay the bond. Of 
concern is the fact that detention centers are dreary, danger-
ous places, and those who are held in them can be victims 
of the justice system even if they are innocent of all charges. 
The bail system is also costly because the state must pay 
for the detention of offenders who are unable to raise bail 
and who might otherwise remain in the community. Legal 
scholar Caleb Foote, one of the nation’s leading experts on 
bail, once stated:
The basic problem—poor people and those being 
locked up before trial—remains. I still think pretrial de-
tention is the most pervasive denial of equal protection 
and equal rights in American law.119
In addition, failing to make bail appears to increase the 
risk of being convicted and the degree of punishment re-
ceived. People detained before trial get convicted more of-
ten than those receiving bail and, when convicted, receive 
longer and more punitive sentences than those granted 
pretrial release. About 60 percent of released offenders 
are eventually convicted as compared to more than 80 
percent of detainees. Once they are convicted, detainees 
receive somewhat longer sentences than people released 
before trial.120
Bonding and Recovery Agents Another problem of the 
bail system is the institution of the professional bail bonding 
agent. Normally the bail bonding agent puts up 90 percent 
of a bond fee and the defendant the remaining 10 percent 
(this is called a surety bond). When the defendant appears 
at trial, the bail is returned and the bonding agent keeps 
the entire amount; the defendant’s 10 percent serves as the 
bonding agent’s commission. If the defendant does not show 
up for trial, the bonding agent must pay the entire bail. Usu-
ally bonding agents expect defendants, their friends, or their 
relatives to put up further collateral (such as the deed to 
their house) to cover the risk; they may also purchase insur-
ance to reduce their risk. If collateral is unavailable or the 
bonding agent believes the offender presents too great a risk, 
the bonding agent will refuse to lend bail money, relegating 
the defendant to a jail stay until the trial date. Bail bonding 
agents have often been accused of unscrupulous practices, 
The bail system goes back to English common law. At 
one time the legal relationship existing in the contract law 
of bailment even permitted the trying and sentencing of the 
bailor (the person who posted bail) if the bailee did not ap-
pear for trial.116
Under the U.S. system of justice, the right to bail comes 
from the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which 
states that people can expect to be released on reasonable 
bail in all but capital cases. Thus, in most cases, the accused 
have the right to be released on reasonable bail to prepare 
their defense and continue their life in the community.
Bail Today In practice, a majority of criminal defendants 
are released on bail prior to trial.117 The most recent surveys 
of pretrial release practices show that about two-thirds of fel-
ony defendants were released prior to the fi nal disposition of 
their case. As might be expected, defendants charged with the 
most serious violent offenses are less likely to be released than 
those charged with less serious public-order or drug offenses.
When and how are these decisions made? Bail is typi-
cally considered at a court hearing conducted shortly after 
a person has been taken into custody. At the hearing, such 
issues as crime type, fl ight risk, and dangerousness will be 
considered before a bail amount is set. In jurisdictions with 
pretrial release programs, program staff often interview ar-
restees detained at the jail prior to the fi rst hearing, verify 
the background information, and present recommendations 
to the court at arraignment. Prior record is an important fac-
tor: fewer than half of defendants with an active criminal 
justice status, such as parole or probation at the time of ar-
rest, are released, compared to about 70 percent of these 
with no active status. Some jurisdictions have developed 
bail schedules to make amounts uniform based on crime 
and criminal history.
Pretrial Detention Not all defendants make bail and are 
held in jails or lockups prior to their trial. Some defendants 
are detained because they cannot afford to make bail; oth-
ers are denied bail because of the danger they present to the 
community, a practice called preventive detention. Whether 
a defendant can be expected to appear at the next stage of 
the criminal proceedings is another key issue in determining 
bail.118 Nonetheless, more than half of all violent criminals are 
released before trial. As might be expected, defendants charged 
with murder are the least likely to be released either because 
they could not make bail or were denied bail, prior to case 
disposition, followed by defendants whose most serious arrest 
charge was robbery, motor vehicle theft, burglary, or rape.
The Problems of Bail Bail is quite controversial for a 
number of reasons. A great many people released on bail 
reoffend. Many serious felons released on bail commit new 
crimes while awaiting trial. More than 20 percent of people 
arrested for murder and released on bail are rearrested on 
new charges before their trial. These people are called avert-
able recidivists—their crimes could have been prevented

The project proved to be a great success. A signifi cant 
majority of clients returned for trial when released on 
their own recognizance. The success of ROR in New York 
prompted its adoption in many other large cities around 
the country. The Federal Bail Reform Act of 1984 has made 
release on recognizance an assumption unless the need for 
greater control can be shown in court.122
Abuses by bail bonding agents have prompted a number 
of jurisdictions, including Wisconsin, Nebraska, Kentucky, 
Oregon, and Illinois, to set up systems that allow defendants 
to post a percentage of their bond (usually 10 percent) with 
the court; the full amount is required only if the defendant 
fails to show for trial. This deposit bail system is designed 
to replace the bonding agents. As Figure 17.4 shows, de-
spite efforts to reform the bail system, surety bond is still 
the predominant method used today, followed by release on 
recognizance and conditional bail. Relatively few defendants 
pay full cash bail out of pocket.
such as bribing police and court personnel to secure refer-
rals. Some judges have been accused of refusing to collect 
forfeited bail owed from bonding agents.
If a bailee fails to return for trial, the bonding agent may 
hire skip tracers or recovery agents to track down the fugi-
tive in order to recover the lost bond. These modern bounty 
hunters receive a share of the recovery. Unlike police, bounty 
hunters can enter a suspect’s home without a warrant in most 
states, thanks to an 1873 Supreme Court ruling that gives 
bail bonding agents sweeping powers. While organizations 
such as the National Institute of Bail Enforcement attempt to 
provide training, untrained or unprofessional bounty hunters 
may use brutal tactics that can end in tragedy.
Bail Reform Most states place no precise limit on the 
amount of bail a judge may impose. People charged with 
the most serious crimes usually receive the highest amount 
of bail. As Table 17.1 shows, those suspects given low bail 
have a much greater chance of getting released before trial 
than those who get higher amounts.
These data trouble experts who believe that the bail 
system is discriminatory because defendants who are fi nan-
cially well off can make bail, whereas indigent defendants 
languish in pretrial detention in the county jail. In addition, 
keeping a person in jail imposes serious fi nancial burdens 
on local and state governments—and, in turn, on taxpay-
ers, who must pay for the cost of confi nement. These fac-
tors have given rise to bail reform programs that depend on 
the defendant’s personal promise to appear in court for trial, 
instead of on fi nancial ability to meet bail. These reforms 
have enabled many deserving but indigent offenders to go 
free, but another trend has been to deny people bail on the 
grounds that they are a danger to themselves or to others in 
the community.
The bail reform movement was started in 1961 to 
help alleviate the problems presented by the bail process. 
In New York, the Vera Institute, set up by philanthropist 
Louis Schweit zer and later supported by the Ford Foun-
dation, pioneered the concept of release on recognizance 
(ROR).121 This project found that if the court had suffi cient 
background information about the defendant, it could make 
a reasonably good judgment about whether the accused 
would return to court.

the harmful effects of a criminal conviction. Some may even 
plead guilty to protect accomplices or confederates by “tak-
ing the rap” themselves.129
The defense attorney may seek a bargain to limit his or her 
own involvement in the case. In some instances, defense at-
torneys may want to minimize the effort they put forth for an 
obviously guilty client.130 In other instances, they may simply 
want to adapt to the bureaucratic structure favorable to plea 
bargaining that exists in most U.S. criminal courts.131 Defense 
attorneys may wish to secure noncriminal dispositions for their 
clients, such as placement in a treatment program, and may 
advise them to plead guilty in exchange for this consideration.
The prosecution also can benefi t from a plea bargain. The 
prosecutor’s case may be weaker than hoped for, convincing 
him or her that a trial is too risky. A prosecutor may also be-
lieve that the arresting offi cers made a serious procedural er-
ror in securing evidence that would be brought out during 
pretrial motions. When a defendant pleads guilty, it voids all 
prior constitutional errors made in that case. Of course, no 
matter how strong the state’s case, there is always the chance 
that a jury will render an unfavorable decision. And in a 
world of tight government budgets, a prosecutor’s offi ce may 
be forced to plea bargain simply because it lacks the resources 
and personnel to bring many cases to trial.132 Prosecutors also 
bargain to gain the cooperation of the defendant against his 
or her accomplices, informers, and codefendants.
In sum, plea bargaining is a complex process, involving 
factors ranging from costs and resources to attorney com-
petence, self-interest, and workload to sentencing and bail 
rules, among other issues.133
Plea Bargaining Issues Those who favor plea bargaining ar-
gue that it actually benefi ts both the state and the defendant:
The overall fi nancial costs of criminal prosecution are 
 
■
reduced.
The administrative effi ciency of the courts is greatly 
 
■
improved.
Bail reform has been considered one of the great successes 
in criminal justice reform, but some research efforts indicate 
great disparity in the way judges handle bail decisions. They 
also show that racial and socioeconomic disparity might be 
a factor in decision making.123 If this is so, then the original 
purposes of reforming bail would be negated by bias in the 
justice system. One approach to limiting disparity is the use 
of bail guidelines, which set standard bail amounts based on 
such factors as criminal history and the current charge.124
In sum, bail reform movements have encouraged the use 
of pretrial release. Studies show that most defendants return 
for trial, and most bailees do not commit more crime while 
in the community.
Plea Bargaining
The majority of defendants in criminal trials are convicted 
by their own guilty pleas; plea bargaining is also common 
in juvenile court.125 About 95 percent of all those charged 
with felonies plead guilty; if misdemeanors are included, the 
percentage jumps to 98 percent.126
Plea bargaining is a relatively recent development, tak-
ing hold late in the nineteenth century. During the fi rst 150 
years after the nation’s birth, the trial by jury was viewed 
as the fairest and most reliable method of determining the 
truth in a criminal matter. Not surprisingly, the Constitution 
does not mention plea bargaining nor does the Bill of Rights 
address the issue. However, by the middle of the nineteenth 
century, plea negotiations steadily became the dominant 
method of case disposition in the United States. During 
this evolution, the prevailing view of criminal case process-
ing switched from being a dispute between two parties that 
could be resolved through a trial to a confl ict between the 
state and an individual, controlled by police involvement 
and prosecutorial discretion. As this change evolved, the 
court process switched from dispensing individual care-
fully considered justice via trials, to mass justice dispensed 
through guilty pleas.127 At first, judges were reluctant to 
accept pleas, preferring trials to sharing their power with 
prosecutors (who make the deal). However, plea bargaining 
became more attractive at the turn of the twentieth century 
when the mechanization of manufacture and transportation 
prompted a fl ood of complex civil cases, which persuaded 
judges that criminal cases had to be settled quickly lest the 
court system break down.128 Today, more than 90 percent of 
criminal convictions are estimated to result from negotiated 
pleas of guilty, and most defendants are likely to plead guilty 
even in the most serious felony cases.
Plea bargaining usually occurs between arraignment (or 
initial appearance, in the case of a misdemeanor) and the 
onset of trial. The ways a bargain can be struck in exchange 
for a guilty plea are set out in Exhibit 17.8.
There are a number of different motivations for plea 
bargaining. Defendants, aware of the prosecutor’s strong 
case, plea bargain to minimize their sentences and avoid 
EXHIBIT 17.8 
Forms of Plea Bargaining
The initial charges may be reduced to those of a lesser of-
 
■
fense, thus automatically reducing the sentence imposed.
In cases where many counts are charged, the prosecutor 
 
■
may reduce the number of counts.
The prosecutor may promise to recommend a lenient 
 
■
sentence, such as probation.
When the charge imposed has a negative label attached 
 
■
(such as child molester), the prosecutor may alter the 
charge to a more “socially acceptable” one (such as as-
sault) in exchange for a plea of guilty.

professions are not allowed to be jurors; this latter group 
may include, but is not limited to, physicians, the clergy, 
and government offi cials. The actual jury selection process 
begins with those remaining on the list.
The court clerk, who handles the administrative affairs 
of the trial—including the processing of the complaint, the 
evidence, and other documents—randomly selects enough 
names to supply the required number of jurors. In most 
cases, a criminal trial jury consists of twelve people, with 
two alternate jurors standing by to serve should one of the 
regular jurors be unable to complete the trial.
Once the prospective jurors have been chosen, the pro-
cess of voir dire begins: all people selected are questioned 
by both the prosecution and the defense to determine their 
appropriateness to sit on the jury. They are examined un-
der oath by the government, the defense, and sometimes 
the judge about their backgrounds, occupations, residences, 
and possible knowledge about or interest in the case. A ju-
ror who acknowledges any bias for or prejudice against the 
defendant—a juror who is a friend or relative of the defen-
dant, for example, or who has already formed an opinion 
about the case—is removed for cause and replaced with 
another. Thus any prospective juror who reveals an inability 
to be impartial and render a verdict solely on the basis of 
the evidence presented at the trial may be removed by either 
the prosecution or the defense. Because normally no limit 
is placed on the number of challenges for cause that can be 
offered, it often takes considerable time to select a jury for 
controversial criminal cases.
In addition to challenges for cause, both the prosecu-
tion and the defense are allowed peremptory challenges, 
through which they can excuse jurors for no particular rea-
son or an undisclosed reason. For example, a prosecutor 
might not want a bartender as a juror in a drunken driv-
ing case, believing that a person in that occupation might 
be sympathetic to the accused. Or a defense attorney might 
excuse a male prospective juror to try to obtain a predomi-
nantly female jury for the client. The number of peremptory 
challenges permitted is limited by statute and often varies 
by case and jurisdiction.
The peremptory challenge has long been criticized by 
legal experts who question its fairness and propriety.139 Of 
particular concern was the challenging of African Ameri-
can jurors in interracial crimes that resulted in the try-
ing of African American defendants by all-white juries. In 
a signifi cant case, Batson v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court 
ruled that the use of peremptory challenges to dismiss 
black jurors violated the defendant’s right to equal protec-
tion of the law.140 Since Batson, the Supreme Court has 
further limited the use of peremptory challenges, includ-
ing jury selection in civil trials and jury selection on the 
basis of gender.
Impartial Juries The Sixth Amendment to the Consti-
tution provides for the right to a speedy, public trial by 
an impartial jury. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the 
The prosecution is able to devote more time to cases of 
 
■
greater seriousness and importance.
The defendant avoids possible detention and extended 
 
■
trial and may receive a reduced sentence.134
Thus, those who favor plea bargaining believe it is appropri-
ate to enter into plea discussions where the effective admin-
istration of justice will be served.
It has been argued, however, that plea bargaining en-
courages defendants to waive their constitutional right to 
a trial. Prosecutors are given too much leeway to convince 
defendants to plea bargain, thus circumventing the law.135 
Plea bargaining then raises the danger that innocent people 
will be convicted of a crime if they believe that they have 
little chance of an acquittal because they are poor, African 
American, or both.
In addition, some experts suggest that sentences tend to 
be less severe in guilty plea situations than as a result of tri-
als and that plea bargains result in even greater sentencing 
disparity. For example, people who plead guilty to murder 
are far less likely to receive the death penalty than those 
convicted at trial.
Particularly in the eyes of the general public, plea bar-
gaining allows the defendant to beat the system and further 
tarnishes the criminal justice process. Some suggest that plea 
bargaining allows dangerous offenders to get off lightly and 
therefore weakens the deterrent effect of the criminal law.136 
It may also undermine public confi dence in the law.137
THE CRIMINAL TRIAL
Although the jury trial is relatively rare, it is still one of the 
cornerstones of the criminal justice process. Most criminal 
prosecutions result in plea bargains and do not involve the 
adversarial determination of guilt or innocence, but the trial 
process remains vitally important to the criminal justice 
system. The opportunity to go to trial guards against abuse 
of informal processing and encourages faith in the criminal 
justice system.138 Because of its importance, jury trial stages, 
critical issues, and associated legal rights are discussed here.
Jury Selection
The fi rst stage of the trial process involves jury selection. Ju-
rors are selected randomly in both civil and criminal cases, 
usually from voter registration lists and other sources within 
each court’s jurisdiction. The initial list of people chosen, 
which is called a venire or jury array, provides the state 
with a group of citizens potentially capable of serving on a 
jury. Many states, by law, review the venire to eliminate un-
qualifi ed people and to exempt those who by reason of their

608  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Supreme Court sought to ensure compliance with this 
constitutional mandate of impartiality through decisions 
eliminating racial discrimination in jury selection. For in-
stance, in Ham v. South Carolina in 1973, the Court held 
that the defense counsel of an African American civil rights 
leader was entitled to question each juror on the issue of 
racial prejudice.141 In Turner v. Murray, the Court ruled 
that African American defendants accused of murdering 
whites are entitled to have jurors questioned about their 
racial bias.142 In Taylor v. Louisiana, the Court overturned 
the conviction of a man by an all-male jury because a Loui-
siana statute allowed women but not men to exempt them-
selves from jury duty.143
These and similar decisions have provided safeguards 
against jury bias. However, in many instances, potential jury 
bias is not part of the trial process. For example, while the 
Supreme Court in Ham ruled that bias was a consideration 
in a trial involving a civil rights worker, it ruled in another 
case that in “ordinary crimes”—noncapital cases, such as a 
robbery—defense counsel may not examine the racial bias 
of jurors even if the crime is interracial.144
The Trial Process
The trial of a criminal case is a formal process conducted in 
a specifi c, orderly fashion in accordance with rules of crimi-
nal law, procedure, and evidence (Figure 17.5).
Unlike trials in popular television programs, where 
witnesses are often asked leading and prejudicial ques-
tions and where judges go far beyond their supervisory 
role, the modern criminal trial is a complicated and often 
time-consuming technical affair. It is a structured adversary 
proceeding in which both the prosecution and the defense 
follow specifi c rules and argue the merits of their cases be-
fore the judge and the jury. Each side seeks to present its 
case in the most favorable light. Where possible, the pros-
ecutor and the defense attorney object to evidence they 
consider damaging to their individual points of view. The 
prosecutor uses direct testimony, physical evidence, and a 
confession, if available, to convince the jury that the ac-
cused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense at-
torney rebuts the government’s case with his or her own 
evidence, makes certain that the constitutional rights of the 
defendant are considered during all phases of the trial, and 
determines whether an appeal is appropriate if the client is 
found guilty. Throughout the process, the judge promotes 
an orderly, fair trial.
The basic steps of the criminal trial proceed as follows:
 1. Opening statements. As the trial begins, both prosecu-
tion and defense address the jury and present their 
cases. They describe what they will attempt to prove 
and the major facts of the case. They introduce the wit-
nesses, prepare the jury for their testimony, and tell 
them what information to listen for. The defense begins

to emphasize that any doubts about the guilt of the ac-
cused must be translated into an acquittal; the prosecu-
tion dwells on civic duty and responsibility.

all the evidence has been presented to the court, the de-
fense attorney may again submit a motion for a directed 
verdict. If the motion is denied, both the prosecution 
and the defense prepare to make closing arguments; and 
the case on the evidence is ready for consideration by 
the jury.
 6. Closing arguments. Closing arguments are used by the 
attorneys to review the facts and evidence of the case 
in a manner favorable to their positions. At this stage 
of the trial, both prosecution and defense are permit-
ted to draw reasonable inferences and show how the 
facts prove or refute the defendant’s guilt. Often both 
attorneys have a free hand in arguing about facts, is-
sues, and evidence, including the applicable law. They 
cannot comment, however, on matters not in evidence, 
nor, where applicable, can they comment on the defen-
dant’s failure to testify. Normally, the defense attorney 
makes a closing statement fi rst, followed by the pros-
ecutor. Either party can elect to forgo the fi nal summa-
tion to the jury.
 7. Instructions to the jury. In a criminal trial, the judge in-
structs, or charges, the jury on the principles of law 
that ought to guide and control the decision on the 
defendant’s innocence or guilt. Included in the charge 
is information about the elements of the alleged of-
fense, the type of evidence needed to prove each el-
ement, and the burden of proof required to obtain a 
guilty verdict. Although the judge commonly provides 
the instructions, he or she may ask the prosecutor and 
 2. The prosecution’s case. Follow-
ing the opening statement, 
the government begins its case 
by presenting evidence to the 
court through its witnesses. 
Those called as witnesses—
such as police offi cers, victims, 
or expert witnesses—provide 
testimony via direct examina-
tion, during which the prose-
cutor questions the witness to 
reveal the facts believed perti-
nent to the government’s case. 
Testimony involves what the 
witness actually saw, heard, or 
touched; it does not include 
opinions. However, a wit-
ness’s opinion can be given in 
certain situations, such as in 
describing the motion of a ve-
hicle or indicating whether a 
defendant appeared to act in-
toxicated or insane. Witnesses 
may also give their opinions 
if they are experts on a par-
ticular subject relevant to the 
case; for example, a psychia-
trist may testify as to a defendant’s mental capacity at 
the time of the crime.
 3. Cross-examination. After the prosecutor finishes ques-
tioning a witness, the defense cross-examines the same 
witness by asking questions in an attempt to clarify the 
defendant’s role in the crime. The prosecutor may seek 
a redirect examination after the defense attorney has 
completed cross-examination; this allows the pros-
ecutor to ask additional questions about information 
brought out during cross-examination. Finally, the de-
fense attorney may question or cross-examine the wit-
ness once again. All witnesses for the trial are sworn in 
and questioned in the same basic manner.
 4. The defense’s case. At the close of the prosecution’s case, 
the defense may ask the presiding judge to rule on 
a motion for a directed verdict. If this motion is sus-
tained, the judge directs the jury to acquit the defen-
dant, thereby ending the trial. A directed verdict means 
that the prosecution did not present enough evidence to 
prove all the elements of the alleged crime. If the judge 
fails to sustain the motion, the defense presents its case. 
Witnesses are called to testify in the same manner used 
by the prosecution.
 5. Rebuttal. After the defense concludes its case, the gov-
ernment may present rebuttal evidence. This normally 
involves bringing forward evidence that was not used 
when the prosecution initially presented its case. The 
defense may examine the rebuttal witnesses and intro-
duce new witnesses in a process called surrebuttal. After 
The defense may bring in experts to present scientific evidence to the jury in order to prove their case.

intra-oral wound by a gunshot by introducing a plastic rod inside the mouth of a forensic plastic model.

610  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Trials and the Rule of Law
Every trial has its constitutional issues, complex legal proce-
dures, rules of court, and interpretations of statutes—all de-
signed to ensure that the accused gets a fair trial. This section 
discusses the most important constitutional rights of the ac-
cused at trial and reviews the legal nature of the trial process.
Right to a Speedy Trial The Sixth Amendment guarantees 
a defendant the right to a speedy trial. This means that an 
accused is entitled to be tried within a reasonable period. If 
a person’s right to a speedy trial is violated, then a complete 
dismissal of the charges against him or her is required.146 In 
determining whether a defendant’s right to speedy trial has 
been violated, several factors are considered; length of delay 
alone does not constitute a violation. The Supreme Court, 
in the case of Barker v. Wingo, enumerated the factors that 
should be considered in determining whether the speedy 
trial requirement has been complied with: (1) the length of 
the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) the timeliness of 
the defendant’s assertion of his or her right to a speedy trial, 
and (4) the prejudice to the defendant.147
There is no set standard, but the Federal Speedy Trial 
Act of 1974 mandates 30 days from arrest to indictment and 
70 days from indictment to trial. However, the states vary 
widely in their defi nitions of a speedy trial.
Right to a Jury Trial Because a jury trial is considered 
a fundamental right, the Supreme Court, in the case of 
Duncan v. Louisiana, made the guarantee applicable to the 
states through the Fourteenth Amendment.148 However, 
the question arises as to whether this right extends to all 
defendants—those charged with misdemeanors as well as 
felonies. The Supreme Court addressed this issue in the case 
of Baldwin v. New York, in which it decided that defendants 
are entitled to a jury trial only if they face the possibility 
of a prison sentence of more than six months.149 Later, in 
Blanton v. City of North Las Vegas, the Court upheld the six 
month–plus jail sentence requirement for a jury trial but did 
not rule out that a lesser term accompanied by the possibil-
ity of other punishment, such as a large fine or loss of a 
driver’s license for a year, might warrant a jury trial.150
Although most people think of a jury as having twelve 
members and, historically, most have had twelve, the Sixth 
Amendment does not specify a jury size. In fact, in the case 
of Williams v. Florida, the Supreme Court held that a six-
person jury fulfi lled a defendant’s right to a trial by jury.151 
However, a unanimous verdict is required when a six-per-
son jury is used. When a twelve-person jury is used, the 
Supreme Court has maintained that the Sixth Amendment 
does not require a unanimous verdict, except in fi rst-degree 
murder cases. In Apodica v. Oregon, the Court found consti-
tutional an Oregon statute that required a fi nding of guilt 
by ten out of twelve jurors in cases of assault with a deadly 
weapon, burglary, and larceny.152 However, it should be 
noted that the majority of states and the federal courts still 
require a unanimous verdict.
the defense attorney to submit instructions for consid-
eration; the judge then uses discretion in determining 
whether to use any of their instructions. The instruc-
tions that cover the law applicable to the case are ex-
tremely important because they may serve as the basis 
for a subsequent appeal.
   
One important aspect of instructing the jury is ex-
plaining the level of proof needed to find the person 
guilty of a crime. As mentioned, the U.S. system of 
justice requires guilt to be proved beyond a reasonable 
doubt. The judge must inform the jurors that if they 
have even the slightest suspicion that the defendant is 
not guilty, then they cannot find for the prosecution. 
Also, the judge must explain how, in criminal cases, the 
burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove the de-
fendant guilty; the accused does not have to prove his or 
her innocence.
 8. Verdict. Once the charge has been given to the jury, the 
jurors retire to deliberate on a verdict. The verdict in a 
criminal case is usually required to be unanimous. A re-
view of the case by the jury may take hours or even days. 
The jurors are always sequestered during their delibera-
tions; in some lengthy, highly publicized cases, they are 
kept overnight in a hotel until the verdict is reached. In 
less sensational cases, the jurors may be allowed to go 
home but are often cautioned not to discuss the case 
with anyone. If a verdict cannot be reached, the trial 
may result in a hung jury; in this case the prosecutor has 
to bring the defendant to trial again to get a conviction.
 9. Sentence. If found not guilty, the defendant is released. 
If the defendant is convicted, the judge normally orders 
a presentence investigation by the probation department 
preparatory to imposing a sentence. Before sentenc-
ing, the defense attorney often submits a motion for a 
new trial, alleging that legal errors occurred in the trial 
proceedings. The judge may deny the motion and im-
pose a sentence immediately, a practice quite common 
in most misdemeanor offenses. In felony cases, however, 
the judge sets a date for sentencing, and the defendant is 
either placed on bail or held in custody until that time. 
Sentencing usually occurs a short time after trial. At the 
sentencing hearing, the judge (or jury) may consider 
evidence that is relevant to the case, including victim im-
pact statements.145 In most jurisdictions, typical criminal 
penalties include fi nes, community supervision, incar-
ceration, and the death penalty (decided by the jury).
 10. Appeal. After sentencing, defendants have the right to ap-
peal the case, charging either that the law under which 
they were tried was unconstitutional (for example, dis-
criminatory or vague) or that the procedures used by 
agents of the justice system violated their constitutional 
rights (for example, police did not give them a proper 
Miranda warning or improperly obtained evidence was 
used at trial). If the appeal is granted, a new trial may be 
ordered. If the appeal is not sustained, the convicted of-
fender begins serving the sentence imposed, thus mark-
ing the end of the judicatory process.

alternatives, essential for the defendant’s own safety or the 
safety of others.160
Right to Confront Witnesses The accused has the right 
to confront witnesses to challenge their assertions and per-
ceptions: Did they really hear what they thought they did? 
Or see what they think they saw? Are they biased? Honest? 
Trustworthy?
An important confrontation issue is the ability to shield 
child witnesses from the trauma of a court appearance. In 
Maryland v. Craig, the Supreme Court ruled that child wit-
nesses could testify via closed-circuit television as long as 
safeguards were set up to protect the defendant’s rights.161 
Protections included the defendant being able to view the 
witness and being in communication with the witness’s at-
torney at all times.
Right to Press Coverage There have been a number of 
specifi c points of contention between the press, who want 
to report on a case, and the judiciary, who are concerned 
that publicity will taint the trial process. The clash can be-
gin even before a trial takes place if a judge attempts to 
stifl e press coverage or prohibit newspapers from printing 
articles about the case. In the most critical free press–fair 
trial case, Richmond Newspapers Inc. v. Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia (1980), the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the First 
Amendment to mean that members of the press (and the 
public) have a right to attend trials.162
In the future, the question of access of the press to 
nontrial judicial and administrative hearings may become 
signifi cant. Should the press have the right to attend and re-
port on deportation hearings involving illegal immigrants or 
quasimilitary hearings involving suspected terrorists? Proce-
dures at these new and different types of hearings must still 
be mapped out.163
Televising Criminal Trials Today, many state courts permit 
televised coverage of trials, often at the judge’s discretion; the 
use of television cameras, video recorders, and still photogra-
phy is banned in the federal court system.164 Televising crimi-
nal proceedings could have significant advantages. Judges 
would be better prepared; the public would be informed 
about important legal issues; and the proceedings would serve 
an educational function, offsetting the simplistic views offered 
by television programs and feature fi lms. On the other hand, 
televising trials can have some drawbacks. Broadcasting can 
feed the media frenzy that has turned some high-profi le cases 
into a three-ring circus. Lawyers might be encouraged to show 
off for the camera rather than prepare a sound legal defense—
as may witnesses and possibly the judge and defendant as 
well. Security may become an issue. Witnesses are already re-
luctant to testify in high-profi le cases against organized crime 
and drug cartels. How will they react if forced to testify while 
their face is broadcast around the world? The same will apply 
to jurors fearful of retaliation. Under these circumstances, trial 
judges may be inclined to ban cameras from the very cases 
that the public is most interested in viewing.165
Right to Be Free from Double Jeopardy The Fifth 
Amendment provides that no person shall “be subject for 
the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” 
This means that a defendant cannot be prosecuted by a juris-
diction more than once for a single offense. For example, if 
a defendant is tried and found not guilty of murder in Texas, 
he cannot be tried again for the same murder in Texas. The 
right to be protected from double jeopardy was made ap-
plicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment 
in the case of Benton v. Maryland.153 However, a person tried 
in federal court can be tried in state court and vice versa.154 
And in 1985 the Court ruled in Heath v. Alabama that if a 
single act violates the laws of two states, the offender may be 
punished for each offense under the dual sovereignty doc-
trine: legal jurisdictions have the right to enforce their own 
laws, and a single act can violate the laws of two separate 
jurisdictions.155
Right to Legal Counsel Regardless of the legal rights 
citizens command at trial, without legal counsel to aid 
them, they would be rendered defenseless before the law. 
Consequently, the Sixth Amendment provides the right to 
be represented by an attorney in criminal trials. However, 
the vast majority of criminal defendants are indigents who 
cannot afford private legal services. In a series of cases be-
ginning in the 1930s, the U.S. Supreme Court established 
the defendant’s right to be represented by an attorney and, 
in the event he or she cannot pay for representation, to 
have the state provide free legal services. First, in Powell 
v. Alabama, the Court held that an attorney was essential 
in capital cases where the defendant’s life was at stake.156 
Then, in the critically important case of Gideon v. Wain-
wright, the Court granted the absolute right to counsel 
in all felony cases.157 Finally, in Argersinger v. Hamlin, the 
defendant’s right to counsel in misdemeanor cases was 
established.158
What about a case in which incarceration is not on the 
table but could be an issue later on? In Alabama v. Shelton 
(2002), the Court ruled that a defendant must be repre-
sented by counsel if he or she receives a probation sentence 
in which a prison or jail term is suspended but can later 
be imposed if the rules of probation are violated. In other 
words, if the sentence contains even a threat of future incar-
ceration, the defendant must be afforded the right to coun-
sel at trial.159
Right to Be Competent at Trial In order to stand trial, a 
criminal defendant must be considered mentally competent 
to understand the nature and extent of the legal proceed-
ings. If a defendant is considered mentally incompetent, 
the trial must be postponed until treatment renders the 
defendant capable of participating in his or her own de-
fense. Can state authorities force a mentally unfi t defendant 
to be treated so that the person can be tried? In Riggins v. 
Nevada, the Supreme Court ruled that forced treatment 
does not violate a defendant’s due process rights if it was 
(a) medically appropriate and (b) considering less intrusive

612  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
 1. Be familiar with the different 
levels of law enforcement
There are several major law 
 
■
enforcement agencies. On 
the federal level, the FBI is 
the largest law enforcement 
organization. Other agencies 
include the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration, the U.S. 
Marshals, and the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, 
and Explosives. County-level 
law enforcement is provided 
by sheriffs’ departments. Most 
states maintain state police 
agencies. However, most law 
enforcement activities are car-
ried out by local metropolitan 
police agencies.
 2. Discuss the police role
Police offi cers are the gate-
 
■
keepers of the criminal justice 
process. They use their power 
of arrest to initiate the justice 
process. The police role is 
multilevel. Police offi cers fi ght 
crime, keep the peace, and 
provide community services. 
Police offi cers are charged with 
deterring and preventing crime 
as well as other duties such as 
providing medical care and di-
recting traffi c.
 3. Understand the concept of com-
munity-oriented policing
Community-oriented polic-
 
■
ing (COP) consists of a return 
to an earlier style of policing, 
in which offi cers on the beat 
had intimate contact with the 
people they served. COP can 
be a specifi c program or a 
 philosophy. COP is important 
because it promotes interac-
tion between offi cers and 
citizens. It also gives offi cers 
the time to meet with local 
residents to talk about crime 
in the neighborhood and to 
use personal initiative to solve 
problems.
SUMMARY
 4. Know what is meant by the 
term problem-oriented policing
Traditionally, the police have 
 
■
focused on responding to calls 
for help in the fastest possible 
time, dealing with the situa-
tion, and then getting on the 
street again as soon as possible. 
Problem-oriented policing takes 
on a proactive orientation. 
Problem-oriented policing strat-
egies require police agencies to 
identify particular long-term 
community problems and to 
develop strategies to eliminate 
them. Concentrating police re-
sources on so-called hotspots of 
crime could appreciably reduce 
crime.
 5. Know when the police can 
search without a warrant
Stop-and-frisk requires that 
 
■
an offi cer have reasonable 
suspicion that a crime may be 
committed. After a lawful ar-
rest, the police may search the 
suspect and the area within the 
suspect’s immediate control. 
Automobiles can be searched 
without a warrant, so long 
as there is probable cause to 
search. Consent searches do 
not require warrants or prob-
able cause because the con-
senting party waives his or her 
Fourth Amendment rights. If 
an offi cer is engaged in a lawful 
search and has probable cause 
that an item in plain view is 
subject to seizure, the item can 
be seized.
 6. Explain the essence of the 
Miranda v. Arizona decision
Miranda v. Arizona
 
■
 requires 
that police offi cers advise 
people who are both in cus-
tody and interrogated of the 
constitutional right (from 
the Fifth Amendment) not to 
incriminate themselves. Sus-
pects who are advised of their 
Miranda rights are told: (1) 
they have the right to remain 
silent; (2) if they decide to 
make a statement, the state-
ment can and will be used 
against them in a court of law; 
(3) they have the right to have 
an attorney present at the time 
of the interrogation, or they 
will have an opportunity to 
consult with an attorney; and 
(4) if they cannot afford an at-
torney, one will be appointed 
for them by the state. The Su-
preme Court has modifi ed the 
Miranda rule to some extent 
over the years. Mostly, its deci-
sions have relaxed the Miranda 
rule. The impact of Miranda 
on law enforcement, such as 
through lost convictions, is 
fairly minimal.
 7. Know the different elements of 
the court system
The judicatory process pro-
 
■
vides a forum for deciding the 
outcome of a confl ict between 
two or more parties. This pro-
cess is played out in the na-
tion’s court system. State courts 
usually involve a multitiered 
system—lower trial courts, 
superior trial courts, appellate 
courts, and supreme court. 
The federal system is similar; it 
contains trial courts, appellate 
courts, and the U.S. Supreme 
Court, which is the fi nal court 
of appeals for all state and fed-
eral cases.
 8. Discuss the role of the three 
main actors in the judicatory 
process
There are three main actors 
 
■
in the judicatory process: the 
prosecutor, the defense at-
torney, and the judge. The 
prosecutor brings charges 
against the offender and then 
represents the state in all 
criminal matters. The defense

the poor, who can neither af-
ford bond nor borrow it from 
bonding agents. Consequently, 
reform programs, such as 
 release on recognizance, have 
been employed. Plea bargain-
ing involves the prosecutor 
allowing defendants to plead 
guilty as charged in return 
for some consideration—for 
 example, a reduced sentence 
or dropped charges. Plea bar-
gaining has been criticized 
because it represents the un-
checked use of discretion by 
prosecutors. Often serious 
criminals can receive light 
sentences by bargaining, and 
some people may be coerced 
into pleading guilty because 
they fear a harsh sentence if 
they go to trial. An effort has 
been made to control plea 
bargains, but they are still 
 frequently used.
attorney represents the accused 
at all stages of the judicatory 
process. Some defendants 
can afford to hire private at-
torneys for their defense, but 
the majority are represented 
by defense counsel appointed 
and paid for by the state. The 
judge controls the trial, rules 
on issues of evidence, charges 
the jury, and in some cases 
chooses the type and length of 
sentence.
 9. Know the elements of the pre-
trial stage of justice
The pretrial stage of the justice 
 
■
process involves such issues as 
bail and plea bargaining. Bail 
is a money bond the defendant 
puts up to secure freedom be-
fore trial. It is controversial be-
cause those who cannot make 
bail must spend their time 
in detention. Critics charge 
that bail discriminates against 
 10. Track the process and stages of 
the criminal trial
The trial has a number of 
 
■
distinct stages, including jury 
selection, opening statements, 
presentation of evidence by 
prosecution and defense, 
 closing arguments, instruc-
tions to the jury, verdict, sen-
tence, and appeal. The rule 
of law also affects criminal 
trials. The Supreme Court has 
required that trials be speedy, 
public, and fair, and has ruled 
that people have a right to be 
free from double jeopardy and 
to be represented by compe-
tent counsel. The judicatory 
process provides a forum for 
deciding the outcome of a 
 confl ict between two or more 
parties. This process is played 
out in the nation’s court 
system.

614  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
 1. Distinguish among the duties of the 
state police, sheriff’s departments, 
and local police departments.
 2. What do you think are the social 
trends that may infl uence policing 
during the coming decade?
 3. Should male and female offi cers 
have exactly the same duties in a 
police department? If not, why not?
 4. A police offi cer orders an un-
armed person running away 
from a burglary to stop; the sus-
pect keeps running and is shot 
and killed by the offi cer. Has the 
offi cer committed a crime? 
Explain.
 5. Would you like to live in a society 
that abolished police discretion 
and used a full enforcement pol-
icy? Why or why not?
 6. Should obviously guilty people go 
free because police originally 
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
arrested them with less than 
probable cause? Should illegally 
seized evidence be excluded 
from trial, even though it is 
 conclusive proof of a person’s 
criminal acts?
 7. Have the courts given criminals 
too many rights? Should courts be 
more concerned with the rights of 
the victims or the rights of 
offenders?

ON
On March 18, 2007, Rachel Holt, 35, a sixth-grade science teacher, pleaded guilty to having sex with one 
of her 13-year-old students. During the sentencing hearing, prosecutors demanded that Holt be given 
the maximum sentence of 25 years, one for each of the times she had sex with the boy during an intense 
weeklong affair. She also gave the boy alcohol and allowed him to drive her car. In contrast, Holt’s attorney 
reviewed 40 similar cases and found the average punishment was 18 months behind bars. Holt herself 
apologized “to everyone who suffered” as a result of her actions, including the victim and his family. 
“I hope you can forgive me,” she said. “I know what I did was wrong.” Speaking for the family, the boy’s 
uncle claimed, “He had his innocence taken away through betrayal.” After considering all arguments and 
statements, Superior Court Judge Calvin L. Scott sentenced Holt to 10 years in prison.1

sadistic sanctions would act as a deterrent. But the variety 
and creativity of the tortures infl icted on even minor crim-
inals before their death suggest that sadism and spectacle 
were more important than any presumed deterrent effect.
The discovery of the New World changed the nature 
of punishment. Rather than kill criminals, it became eco-
nomically and politically more attractive to transport them 
to overseas colonies. They supplied labor, cost little, and 
were profi table for the government because manufacturers 
and plantation owners paid for convicts’ services and served 
as a means of creating a native-speaking population abroad. 
The Old Bailey Court in London supplied at least 10,000 
convicts between 1717 and 1775 to the Americas, helping 
secure the continent for England.5 Convicts would serve a 
period as workers and then become free again.
Transportation to the colonies waned as a method of 
punishment with the increase in colonial population, fur-
ther development of the land, and increasing importation 
of African slaves in the eighteenth century. The American 
Revolution ended transportation of felons to North Amer-
ica; the remaining areas used were Australia, New Zealand, 
and African colonies. Nonetheless, hanging and physical 
punishments were the norm, and people went to their death 
after convictions of theft and were whipped for speaking 
out against the government. In 1795, English law included 
more than 200 felonies that were punishable by execution, 
including not only murder and rape, but also burglary, rob-
bery, animal theft, the concealment of bankruptcy, and the 
malicious maiming of cattle.6
Reforming Correctional Punishment
Punishing people by incarcerating them in prisons and/or 
jails can actually be traced to a liberal reform effort insti-
gated by William Penn (1644–1718), the founder of the 
state of Pennsylvania.7 At the end of the seventeenth cen-
tury, Penn revised Pennsylvania’s criminal code to forbid

Did Rachel Holt deserve a 10-year prison sentence or is her 
lawyer correct when he claims that she was punished ex-
cessively for her misdeeds? Should the sentence have been 
more in line with what other teachers received for similar 
crimes, or is each case unique? And was Holt’s punishment 
overly severe considering the sentences routinely handed 
out for violent crimes? Table 18.1 contains the most recent 
data on conviction offense and subsequent punishment in 
the nation’s 75 largest counties. As the data show, about 
18 percent of convicted felons are given nonincarceration 
sentences such as probation. More than 20 percent of con-
victed rapists, 13 percent of robbers, and 23 percent of 
felony assaulters never set foot behind bars.2 The median 
sentence for a violent felony is now four years in prison, less 
than half of the ten years received by Rachel Holt.
As the Holt case illustrates, developing fair and effective 
punishments is a very difficult task. How can the proper 
sentence be formulated? Is it fair to punish one person more 
severely than another? And if so, what factors shape the 
contours of justice? What does society gain from keeping 
someone like Rachel Holt in prison for 10 years? Would fi ve 
years be suffi cient? What about three? Would we better off 
supervising her in the community with the condition that 
she stay away from young boys and devote her life to help-
ing others?
In this chapter, we will review the way we punish crimi-
nals. We begin by looking at the nature and purpose of sen-
tencing criminals, reviewing how sentences are distributed, 
and then reviewing contemporary forms of correction and 
supervision of those convicted of criminal offenses.
A BRIEF HISTORY 
OF PUNISHMENT
When a person is convicted of a criminal offense, society 
exercises the right to punish or correct his or her behav-
ior. Equating crime and punishment is certainly not a new 
practice.3 Criminal offenders have been punished by gov-
ernmental authorities throughout recorded history. Over 
the centuries, there has been signifi cant debate as to why 
people should be punished and what type of punishment 
is most appropriate to correct, treat, or deter criminal of-
fenders. The style and purpose of criminal corrections have 
gone through many stages and have featured a variety of 
penal sanctions.4
From ancient times up until the fi fteenth century, punish-
ment for crime and misbehavior was immediate and severe, 
consisting of banishment, mutilation, branding, fl ogging, or 
death. Punishments became unmatched in their cruelty, fea-
turing a gruesome variety of physical tortures. Punishment 
was also made into a public spectacle, presumably so the

CHAPTER 18 | Punishment and Correction  621
Competing Correctional Models
In the early nineteenth century, Pennsylvania took the radi-
cal step of establishing prisons that placed each inmate in a 
single cell so the inmate could do “penitence” for his or her 
crimes, hence the term penitentiary. The word penitentiary 
was actually first used in the English Penitentiary Act of 
1779, which authorized the building of national penitentia-
ries in which convicts would be kept in order with strict dis-
cipline and hard labor. But the buildings were never actually 
constructed. It was in Pittsburgh that the fi rst Western State 
Penitentiary was built, mandated by the General Assembly 
in 1818 and opened in 1826. The prison consisted entirely 
of banks of individual cells, so small that the entire building 
had to be demolished in the 1830s and rebuilt in 1882 with 
larger individual cells. Known as Riverside, it survives and 
is still in use.
The Eastern State Penitentiary at Cherry Hill, Philadel-
phia, was opened in 1829, with a more radical design that 
emphasized solitary cells. This penitentiary was designed 
to isolate people found guilty of a felony from normal so-
ciety. It was believed that penitence, pastoral counseling, 
and reasonable discipline would correct antisocial behavior. 
Seven wings, each containing 76 cells, radiated from a cen-
tral hub, where control personnel were stationed. Each cell 
was 12 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 10 feet high, designed 
for single occupancy. A separate exercise yard, in which the 
prisoner was allowed to be in the open air for an hour a day, 
was provided adjacent to the cell. Cells were separated by 
stone partitions 18 inches thick, which effectively prevented 
communication from prisoner to prisoner. Each prisoner 
had his or her own private cell, centrally heated, with run-
ning water, a fl ush toilet (conveniences not available to the 
president in the White House at the time), and a skylight. 
Adjacent to the cell was a private outdoor exercise yard sur-
rounded by a 10-foot wall. Each inmate was given a Bible 
to read and honest work (such as shoemaking or weaving), 
thought to lead to penitence.10
Solitude was the goal, and prisoners spent their days 
alone. Even at compulsory chapel services they could 
not see one another, because they were seated in chairs 
resembling up-ended coffi ns. The building was a massive 
fortress, resembling a medieval castle, intended to deter 
would-be offenders. The Pennsylvania model was a pe-
nal system based on the belief that most prison ers would 
benefi t from the experience of solitary incarceration. Ex-
hibit 18.1 is an account of the system by its fi rst warden, 
Samuel Wood.
The system was costly to run. Within a few years, when 
crowding became a problem, prisoners were doubled up in 
cells, and solitude was no longer possible. By the end of the 
Civil War, the penitentiary’s population had grown to more 
than 1,000. It was not long before the conditions at the 
Eastern State Penitentiary deteriorated and charges of bru-
tality were launched; these were substantiated at hearings 
that took place in 1834.11
torture and the capricious use of mutilation, physical pun-
ishment, and death, which heretofore had been the norm. 
These devices were replaced by the penalties of incarcera-
tion at hard labor, moderate fl ogging, fi nes, and forfeiture 
of property. All lands and goods belonging to felons were 
used to make restitution to the victims of crimes, with res-
titution limited to twice the value of the damages. Felons 
who owned no property were required by law to labor in 
the prison workhouse until the victim was compensated. 
Punishment was relatively mild for the times: burglary was 
punishable by three months’ imprisonment and restitution 
to the victim; arson was punished by a year at hard labor 
and corporal punishment.
Though Penn’s original reforms were later rescinded and 
English law re-adopted, the seeds had been planted for penal 
reform. In 1790, the Walnut Street Jail was built in Phila-
delphia as a “liberal reform” dedicated to replacing physical 
punishments. At this institution, most prisoners were placed 
in solitary cells, where they remained in isolation and did 
not have the right to work.8 Overcrowding undermined the 
goal of solitary confi nement of serious offenders, and soon 
more than one inmate was placed in each cell. Despite these 
difficulties, similar institutions were erected in New York 
(Newgate in 1791), New Jersey (Trenton in 1798), and 
Massachusetts (Castle Island in 1785). By the turn of the 
nineteenth century, incarceration began to replace physical 
punishment as the preferred method of criminal sanction 
and has remained so ever since.
The Rise of the Prison
In 1816, New York built a new prison at Auburn, hop-
ing to alleviate some of the overcrowding at Newgate. The 
Auburn prison design became known as the tier system 
because cells were built vertically on five floors of the 
structure. It was sometimes also referred to as the con-
gregate system because most prisoners ate and worked in 
groups. In 1819, construction was started on a wing of sol-
itary cells to house unruly prisoners. Three classes of pris-
oners were then created: one group remained continually 
in solitary confi nement as a result of breaches of prison 
discipline; the second group was allowed labor as an oc-
casional form of recreation; and the third and largest class 
worked and ate together during the days and went into 
seclusion only at night.
The philosophy of the Auburn system was crime pre-
vention through fear of punishment and silent confi nement. 
The worst felons were cut off from all contact with other 
prisoners, and although they were treated and fed relatively 
well, they had no hope of pardon to relieve their isolation. 
For a time, some of the worst convicts were forced to re-
main totally alone and silent during the entire day; this 
practice caused many prisoners to have mental breakdowns, 
resulting in suicides and self-mutilations. This practice was 
abolished in 1823.9

622  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Controversy and Conflict The support-
ers of the Pennsylvania system believed 
that the penitentiary was truly a place to 
do penance. By advocating totally remov-
ing the sinner from society and allow-
ing the prisoner a period of isolation in 
which to ponder alone upon the evils of 
crime, the supporters of the Pennsylvania 
system refl ected the infl uence of religious 
philosophy on corrections. In fact, its ad-
vocates believed that solitary confi nement 
(with in-cell labor as a recreation) would 
eventually make working so attractive 
that upon release the inmate would be 
well suited to resume a productive exis-
tence in society. The Pennsylvania system 
eliminated the need for large numbers of 
guards or disciplinary measures. Isolated 
from one another, inmates could not plan 
escapes or collectively break rules. When 
discipline was a problem, whips and iron 
gags were used (iron gags were jammed 
in inmates’ mouths so they could not 
speak, causing great discomfort).
The congregate system eventu-
ally prevailed, however, and spread throughout the United 
States; many of its features are still used today. Its innova-
tions included congregate working conditions, the use of 
solitary confinement to punish unruly inmates, military 
regimentation, and discipline. In Auburn-like institutions, 
prisoners were marched from place to place; their time was 
regulated by bells telling them to sleep, wake up, and work. 
The system was so like the military that many of its early 
administrators were recruited from the armed services.
Although the prison was viewed as an improvement 
over capital and corporal punishment, it quickly became the 
scene of depressed conditions; inmates were treated harshly 
and routinely whipped and tortured. As historian Samuel 
Walker notes:
Prison brutality fl ourished. It was ironic that the prison 
had been devised as a more humane alternative to cor-
poral and capital punishment. Instead, it simply moved 
corporal punishment indoors where, hidden from pub-
lic view, it became even more savage.12
Yet in the midst of such savagery some inmates were 
able to adjust to institutional living and even improve their 
lives through prison-administered literacy programs.13 
Prison conditions began to slowly improve when state and 
federal court rulings gave inmates rights to freedom of re-
ligion and speech, medical care, due process, and proper 
living conditions. In the 1970s, when violence within 
the correctional system became a national scandal and 
major riots occurred at New York’s Attica Prison and the 
New Mexico State Penitentiary, prison administrators re-
sponded with efforts to improve conditions and provide 
This engraving by Samuel Couperthwaite, convict number 2954, shows Eastern State 
Penitentiary architect John Haviland’s design for seven original cellblocks radiating like the 
spokes of a wheel. Eastern State Penitentiary’s hub and spoke design eventually became the 
model for more than 300 prisons worldwide.

Warden Samuel Wood Describes Eastern 
State Penitentiary
When a convict first arrives, he is placed in a cell, and left 
alone, without any work and without any book. His mind can 
only operate on itself; generally but a few hours pass be fore 
he petitions for something to do and for a Bible. No instance 
has occurred in which such a petition has been delayed 
beyond a day or two. If the prisoner has a trade that can be 
pursued in his cell, he is put to work as a favor; as a reward 
for good behavior, and as a favor, a Bible is allowed him. If he 
has no trade, or one that cannot be pursued in his cell, he is 
allowed to choose one that can, and he is instructed by one 
of the over seers, all of whom are master workmen in the 
trades they respectively superintend and teach. Thus work 
and moral and religious books are regarded and received as 
favors, and are withheld as punishment.

The Pennsylvania penitentiary, with its solitary confi ne-
ment and penitence model, was widely hailed both in the 
United States and in Europe. Yet the system was very costly, 
and, as some critics realized at the time, forcing inmates to 
reform in repressive conditions (solitary confinement for 
extended periods) was far more likely to result in insanity 
rather than rehabilitation.

a variety of goals and objectives. A number of factors have 
been found to infl uence sentencing outcomes, including gen-
eral deterrence, specific deterrence, incapacitation, equity, 
diversion, rehabilitation, desert/retribution, and restoration 
(see Exhibit 18.2). In the case of Rachel Holt, the sentencing 
judge may have based his decision on (a) his belief that she 
deserved 10 years in prison for taking advantage of a minor, 
(b) his desire to deter other teachers who might be pondering 
a similar act, (c) his belief that Holt needed to be incapacitated 
in order to protect other kids, or (d) all of the above. The Pro-
fi les in Crime feature discussing a famous case of inexplicable 
murder in Massachusetts illustrates the diffi culty in creating 
proper sentences.

the institution.
THE GOALS OF CRIMINAL 
PUNISHMENT
Why do we punish? What are the goals of criminal sentenc-
ing today? The sentencing decision is a key element of the 
adjudicatory process and its outcome may be infl uenced by 
EXHIBIT 18.2
The Goals of Punishment and Criminal Sentencing
Deterrence. 
 
■
By observing the punishment dished out to 
convicted criminals, would-be offenders can see that the 
“pains of punishment” outweigh the potential benefits of 
criminal behavior. The perception of future punishments 
deters crime. People are not punished merely for what they 
have done, but also for the effect their punishment will have 
on the future behavior of others.
Specific deterrence. 
 
■
Experiencing harsh criminal punish-
ments should convince convicted offenders that crime does 
not pay and recidivism is not in their best interests. The 
“pains of punishment” should inhibit future law violations.
Incapacitation. 
 
■
By incapacitating a convicted offender in 
a secure facility, such as a prison or jail, the state seeks to 
reduce or eliminate his or her opportunity to commit future 
crimes. In some instances, incapacitation involves supervis-
ing an offender while the person remains in the community. 
It is hoped that close monitoring will restrict opportunities to 
commit future crime without the necessity of secure lockup. 
Incapacitation involves anticipating behavior patterns: of-
fenders are confined not just for what they have done but 
for what it is feared they might do in the future.
Rehabilitation. 
 
■
The purpose of sentencing is to reduce future 
criminality by treating and eliminating the underlying causes 
of crime. Offenders are believed to have one or more emo-
tional or behavioral deficits that cause them to violate the 
law. Criminal behavior would cease if this problem could be 
successfully treated. Rehabilitation efforts focus on emotional 
stress, vocational training, education, or substance abuse. 
Rehabilitation also involves predicting future behavior: un-
less the offenders receive treatment, they will commit future 
crimes; treatment reduces the likelihood of their reoffending.
Diversion. 
 
■
In some instances, the court process is aimed at 
sparing nondangerous offenders from the stigma and label-
ing of a criminal conviction and involvement with the justice 
process. Instead of being convicted and sentenced to tra-
ditional forms of correction, such as a stay in a county jail, 
the judge may allow them to be diverted into a community 
correctional program for treatment.
Retribution. 
 
■
Because criminals benefit from their misdeeds, 
they deserve to be punished for their criminal acts. Further-
more, if the state did not punish people for their misconduct 
(retribution), victims would be encouraged to seek personal 
vengeance for their loss (revenge), creating a chaotic society. 
In a just society, criminals are punished in a manner propor-
tionate to the severity of their crimes. According to this view, 
it is only fair that criminals who have committed the most se-
rious crime, murder, receive the most severe penalty, death.
Equity/restitution. 
 
■
Because criminals gain from their mis-
deeds, it seems both fair and just to demand that they reim-
burse society for its loss caused by their crimes. The equity 
goal of punishment means that convicted criminals must pay 
back their victims for their loss, the justice system for the 
costs of processing their case, and society for any disrup-
tion they may have caused. In a so-called victimless crime, 
such as drug trafficking, the social costs might include the 
expense of drug enforcement efforts, drug treatment cen-
ters, and care for infants born to drug-addicted mothers. 
In predatory crimes, the costs might include the services of 
emergency room doctors, lost workdays and productivity, 
and treatment for long-term psychological problems.
Restoration. 
 
■
Defendants may be asked to confront their be-
havior, the damage they caused the victim, and the shame 
they brought to their family, friends, and community. The 
goal is to restore them to good standing in society. Restor-
ative justice advocates suggest a policy based on restoring 
the damage caused by crime and creating a system of jus-
tice that includes all the parties harmed by the criminal act: 
the victim, the offender, the community, and society.

for real.” He seemed fascinated by violent 
books and told friends about part of a book 
he liked that described the dripping sound 
of blood. He visited websites that taught 
bomb-making skills. After the murder, the 
public learned that the teenager had been 
diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, a mild 
form of autism, and a hyperactivity disorder, 
and had been taking several medications. 
He had been enrolled in a special educa-
tion program called Great Opportunities, 
which “provides a welcoming place for stu-
dents whose significant emotional and/or 
psychiatric disabilities have interfered with 
their ability to access public education with-
out the intensive support provided at GO.” 
Odgren was reportedly obsessed with the 
number 19 and the fact that he committed 
his crime on the 19th day of the month was 
not viewed as a coincidence. The prosecu-
tion did not deny that Odgren had a history 
of mental illness, but his condition was not 
serious enough to be considered legal in-
sanity; he was not delusional and knew that 
his actions were a crime. The jury heard 
that Odgren had a history of secretly bring-
ing knives to school and enjoying violent 
novels, as if he were carefully planning the 
“perfect murder.” After two weeks of testi-
mony, the jurors rejected the defense ar-
gument that Odgren was criminally insane 
when he randomly selected Alenson, whom 
he did not know, to kill in a school bath-
room. The jury also rejected the option of 
the lesser offense of second-degree murder, 
which would have made Odgren eligible for 
parole after 15 years. Odgren’s appeal of the 
first-degree murder conviction was rejected 
by the  Supreme Judicial Court.

He Always Seemed Strange
On January 19, 2007, 16-year-old John 
Odgren followed James Alenson, a young 
boy he had never met, into the bathroom 
at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, 
drew out a long knife and stabbed him 
to death. Because he was 16 at the time, 
Massachusetts law required that Odgren 
be charged as an adult—in this case, with 
first-degree murder. Odgren’s attorney, Jon-
athan Shapiro, defended him by suggesting 
that he was delusional and psychotic at the 
time of the murder: “Why did a geeky, un-
coordinated, awkward 16-year-old who had 
never been in any trouble with the law sud-
denly and without provocation ferociously 
stab to death a 15-year-old classmate who 
he did not even know?” Shapiro asked.
Within days, the media tried to answer 
Shapiro’s question. It was reported that 
Odgren had often boasted of violence, that 
he kept a gun at home, and had bragged 
to fellow students that he once tried to kill 
someone. Odgren asked kids, “How many 
people have you killed in the virtual world?” 
and told them, “I once tried to kill a person

Imposing Punishment
Sentencing is one of the most crucial functions of judges. 
Sentencing authority may also be exercised by the jury, an ad-
ministrative body, a judge, or it may be mandated by statute.
In most felony cases, except where the law dictates man-
datory prison terms, sentencing is usually based on a vari-
ety of information available to the judge. Some jurisdictions 
allow victims to make impact statements that are consid-
ered at sentencing hearings, although these often have little 
infl uence on sentencing outcomes.14 Most judges consider 
a presentence investigation report by the probation depart-
ment. This report, which is a social and personal history as 
well as an evaluation of the defendant, is used by the judge 
in making a sentencing decision.15 Some judges heavily 
weigh the presentence investigation report; others may dis-
miss it completely or rely on only certain portions.
When an accused is convicted of two or more charges, 
he or she must be sentenced on each charge. A concurrent 
sentence means that both sentences are served at the same 
time, and the term of imprisonment is completed after the 
longest term has been served. A defendant may be sentenced 
to 3 years imprisonment on a charge of assault and 10 years 
for burglary, the sentences to be served concurrently. After 
the offender serves 10 years in prison, the sentences would 
be completed. A consecutive sentence means that upon 
completion of one sentence, the other term of incarceration 
begins. A defendant sentenced to 3 years imprisonment on 
a charge of assault and 10 years for burglary, the sentences 
to be served consecutively, would serve a total of 13 years. 
In most instances sentences are given concurrently.
Sentencing Structures
When a convicted offender is sentenced to prison, the stat-
utes of the jurisdiction in which the crime was committed 
determine the penalties that may be imposed by the court. 
Over the years, a variety of sentencing structures have been 
used, including determinate sentences, indeterminate sen-
tences, and mandatory sentences.
The Indeterminate Sentence The indeterminate 
sentence is used in a majority of states. Created in the 
nineteenth century by penal reformers, its purpose is to 
encourage inmates to engage in treatment programs by

jurisdictions have attempted to structure determinate sen-
tences by suggesting appropriate prison terms for particular 
crimes.18
Structured Sentencing To ensure that the new deter-
minate sentences would be applied in a fair manner, those 
jurisdictions that embraced determinate sentencing also 
developed guidelines to control and structure the sentenc-
ing process and make it more rational. Sentencing guide-
lines are usually based on the seriousness of a crime and 
the background of an offender: the more serious the crime 
and the more extensive the offender’s criminal background, 
the longer the prison term recommended by the guidelines. 
Guidelines might require that all people convicted of rob-
bery who had no prior offense record and who did not use 
excessive force or violence be given an average of a fi ve-year 
sentence; those who used force and had a prior record will 
have three years added on their sentence. In making their 
sentencing decisions, judges would refer to the guideline 
manual and calculate the proper sentence based on the facts 
promising them early release if they can convince correc-
tional authorities that they have been rehabilitated while 
in prison. Under this scheme, those convicted of criminal 
offenses are given a short minimum sentence that must be 
served and a lengthy maximum sentence that is the outer 
boundary of the time that can possibly be served. For ex-
ample, the legislature might set a sentence of a minimum of 
1 year and a maximum of 20 years for burglary.
The actual length of time served is controlled by the cor-
rections agency. The inmate can be paroled after serving the 
minimum sentence if he or she is considered rehabilitated 
and ready to live in the community. In addition, the mini-
mum (or maximum) time served may be reduced if, while 
in prison, the convicted criminal earns “time off for good 
behavior” for participating in rehabilitation programs and 
behaving well. Inmates today serve about one-third of their 
original sentences.
Most jurisdictions that use indeterminate sentences spec-
ify minimum and maximum terms but allow judges discre-
tion to fi x the actual sentence within those limits. If burglary 
is punishable by a sentence of 2 to 20 years, the judge could 
decide to give one offender 5 to 10 and another offender 2 to 
5 years because he or she cooperated with the prosecution. 
The sentence must be no less than the minimum and no more 
than the maximum range of years set by the legislature.
The underlying purpose of indeterminate sentencing is 
to individualize each sentence in the interests of rehabilitat-
ing the offender. This type of sentencing allows for fl exibil-
ity not only in the type of sentence imposed but also in the 
length of time served.
The Determinate Sentence Determinate sentences, 
which gave the convicted criminal a set number of years 
to be served in prison, were actually the fi rst kind used in 
the United States but were eventually replaced by indeter-
minate sentencing models early in the twentieth century. 
However, the unbridled discretion given judges both-
ered critics who feared that it might be used in an unfair 
manner.
In 1969, Kenneth Culp Davis published Discretion-
ary Justice, which was followed in 1972 by Judge Marvin 
Frankel’s landmark study Criminal Sentences—Law Without 
Order.16 These works exposed the disparity in the justice 
process and called for reform. Frankel stated, “The almost 
wholly unchecked and sweeping powers we give to judges 
in the fashioning of sentences are terrifying and intolerable 
for a society that professes devotion to the rule of law.”17
In response to these concerns, a number of jurisdic-
tions replaced indeterminate sentences and discretionary 
parole with a system of determinate sentencing that featured 
a single term of years without discretionary parole. Earned 
“good time” or time off for good behavior could still reduce 
the actual time served behind bars, in some cases, by up 
to one-half. These modern versions of determinate sentenc-
ing reflect an orientation toward desert, deterrence, and 
equality at the expense of treatment and rehabilitation. Most 
According to the retributionist view of punishment, in a just society 
criminals are punished in a manner proportionate to the severity of 
their crimes. It is only fair that criminals who have committed the most 
serious crime—murder—receive the most severe penalty—death. 
Steven Spader, shown here, is one of four New Hampshire teenagers 
charged in a home break-in and machete attack that left Kimberly 
Cates dead and seriously injured her young daughter. Spader, 17, 
received a life sentence without parole. The judge in the case stated 
that the sentence ensures “you will stay in a cage for the rest of your 
pointless life.” Should Spader have been given the death penalty? The 
Supreme Court has prohibited the execution of youths under 18 no 
matter how serious their crimes. Do you agree with that decision?

offense as the two coordinates and set 
out specific punishments. Figure 18.1 
shows Minnesota’s guidelines. Note that 
as prior record and offense severity in-
crease, so does recommended sentence 
length. After a certain point, probation is 
no longer an option, and the defendant 
must do prison time. A burglar with no 
prior convictions can expect to receive 
probation or an 18-month sentence for a 
house break-in; an experienced burglar 
with six or more prior convictions can 
get 54 months for the same crime, and 
probation is not an option. While fol-
lowing the guidelines is expected, they 
are recommendations based on typical 
circumstances. For a case that is not typ-
ical, the judge can depart from the rec-
ommended sentence. If the court does 
depart, the judge must state the reasons 
for departure and either the prosecu-
tion or the defense may appeal the pro-
nounced sentence. Italicized numbers 
within the grid denote the range within 
which a judge may sentence without the 
sentence being deemed a departure.
Advisory vs. Mandatory In three 
 decisions, Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000), 
Blakely v. Washington (2004), and United States v. Booker 
(2005), the Supreme Court found that the way sentencing 
guidelines were used both by state and federal courts was in 
violation of a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a jury 
trial. In these rulings, the court held that judges cannot im-
pose sentences beyond the statutory maximum unless the 
facts supporting such an increase are found by a jury be-
yond a reasonable doubt.22 The only exception would be a 
prior conviction, which is a fact and not a matter for inter-
pretation.23 In essence, the rulings made guidelines advisory 
rather than mandatory.
These cases did not outlaw guidelines, but ruled that 
there must be changes in the way they are administered. 
A recent report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found 
that in more than 80 percent of federal cases judges con-
tinue to sentence within the range of existing guidelines.24 
While this result means guidelines still have a major im-
pact on sentencing, even in their advisory role, it does not 
mean they have fi nally served their core purpose: remov-
ing discretion and unfairness from the sentencing process. 
In fact, the Sentencing Commission recently found sig-
nifi cant evidence that minorities are still receiving long er 
sentences in the wake of the Booker decision.25 The Sen-
tencing Commission found that “Black male offenders 
received longer sentences than white male offenders . . . 
[and that] . . . the differences in sentence length have in-
creased steadily since Booker.”
of the case and the characteristics of the defendant. Guide-
lines eliminate discretionary parole but also allow inmates 
to reduce their sentence by acquiring time off for good be-
havior. By eliminating judicial discretion, they are designed 
to reduce racial and gender disparity.19
The Nature of Guidelines Guidelines were created by 
appointed sentencing commissions whose members at-
tempted to formulate what an “ideal” sentence would be for 
a particular crime and offender. In some instances their de-
cisions were based on empirical analysis of existing sentenc-
ing practices, while in other instances sentences were based 
on the beliefs of the commissioners. Regardless of the for-
mulation, there is a great deal of variation within guidelines. 
Some coexist with parole release, and some do not. Some 
deal with all crimes and others only with felonies. Some set 
narrow sentencing ranges, and some set broad ones. Some 
address sentences of all types, and some address only state 
prison sentences.20 Some employ what is known as a “com-
prehensive structured sentencing system,” which sets sen-
tencing standards for felonies and misdemeanors, and for 
prison, jail, intermediate, and community punishments. 
They also include mechanisms for tying sentencing policy 
to correctional capacity and for distributing state funds to 
stimulate and support local corrections programs.21
There are a number of ways to formulate guidelines. 
One method is to create a grid with prior record and current 
Sentences can run concurrently, consecutively, or both in the case of being sentenced for 
multiple crimes. Here, Diego Olmos Alcalde leaves the courtroom after receiving a life sentence 
on June 29, 2009, in Boulder, Colorado, for the murder of Susannah Chase, a 23-year-old 
college student from Stamford, Connecticut. Alcalde, a Chilean national, also received prison 
sentences of 48 years for sexual assault and 24 years for kidnapping, to be served concurrently 
to each other but after the life sentence.

future is still uncertain. However, on March 6, 2003, the U.S. 
Supreme Court in Lockyer v. Andrade upheld the three strike 
sentence of Leandro Andrade, a man sentenced to prison in 
California for 50 years for stealing $153 worth of videotapes. 
It also upheld the conviction of Gary Ewing, who appealed a 
prior 25-year sentence for stealing a set of golf clubs. In both 
cases the Court ruled that the challenged sentences were not 
so grossly disproportionate as to violate the Eighth Amend-
ment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.31 
These cases solidifi ed the legality of three strike laws.
HOW PEOPLE ARE 
SENTENCED
The federal government conducts surveys on sentencing 
practices in state and federal courts.32 The most recent sur-
vey found that more than 1.1 million adults are convicted 
of felonies in a single year. What happens after conviction? 
About 70 percent of all felons convicted in state courts are 
sentenced to a period of confi nement—41 percent to state 
prisons and 28 percent to local jails.33 The rest are sentenced 
to straight probation with no jail or prison time to serve.
The average felony sentence is approximately fi ve years, 
but most offenders are likely to serve only half of that sen-
tence before release.34 Besides being sentenced to incarcera-
tion (in prison or jail), about one-third of all sentenced felons 
are put on probation or expected to pay a fi ne, pay victim 
restitution, receive treatment, perform community service, 
or comply with some other additional penalty. As Table 18.2 
shows, violent felons who are given a prison sentence average 
Mandatory Sentences Another effort to limit judicial dis-
cretion has been the development of mandatory (minimum) 
sentences that require the incarceration of all offenders con-
victed of specifi c crimes. Some states, for example, exclude 
offenders convicted of certain offenses, such as drug traffi ck-
ing or handgun crimes, from even the possibility of being 
placed on probation; some exclude recidivists; and others 
bar certain offenders from being considered for parole.
Mandatory sentencing generally limits the judge’s discre-
tionary power to impose any disposition but that authorized 
by the legislature. Mandatory sentencing legislation may 
supplement an indeterminate sentencing structure or be a 
feature of structured sentencing. For example, in Massachu-
setts, which uses indeterminate sentencing, conviction for 
possessing an unregistered handgun brings with it a manda-
tory prison term of at least one year.26
Truth in Sentencing First enacted in 1984, truth-in-
 sentencing laws require offenders to serve a substantial 
portion of their prison sentences behind bars.27 Parole eli-
gibility and good-time credits are restricted or eliminated. 
The truth-in-sentencing movement has been a response to 
prison crowding that in some instances has forced the early 
release of inmates from overcrowded institutions. The Vio-
lent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incen-
tive Grant Program in the 1994 Crime Act offered the states 
funds to support the costs of longer sentences.28 To qualify 
for federal funds, states were required to ensure that those 
convicted of violent felony crimes served not less than 85 
percent of their prison sentences. More than 35 states and 
the District of Columbia met the federal Truth-in-Sentencing 
Incentive Grant Program eligibility criteria.29 The funding 
portion of this program was discontinued in 2004, though 
truth-in-sentencing laws still remain in place around the 
United States.
Three Strikes Laws Three strikes (and you’re out) laws 
provide lengthy terms for any person convicted of three 
felony offenses, even if the third crime is relatively trivial. 
California’s three strikes law is aimed at getting habitual 
criminals off the street. Anyone convicted of a third felony 
must do a minimum term of 25 years to life; the third felony 
does not have to be serious or violent. The federal Crime 
Act of 1994 also adopted a three strikes provision, requir-
ing a mandatory life sentence for any offender convicted of 
three felony offenses; 26 states have so far followed suit and 
passed some form of the three strikes law.
Although welcomed by conservatives looking for a rem-
edy for violent crime, the three strikes policy is controversial 
because a person convicted of a minor felony can receive a 
life sentence. Research shows that habitual offender sentenc-
ing laws have little effect on crime rates, and some research 
indicates they may actually increase crime rates, hardly the 
desired effect.30
Because of its use with petty offenders, there are ongo-
ing legal challenges to the use of three strikes laws, and their

about eight years, while property offenders are typically sen-
tenced to about four years. If they receive a jail sentence, their 
period of confi nement is considerably less.
Sentencing Disparity 
Sentencing disparity has long been a problem in the justice 
system. Simply put, it is common for people convicted of sim-
ilar criminal acts to receive widely different sentences. One 
person convicted of burglary receives a three-year prison sen-
tence whereas another is granted probation. Few defendants 
actually serve their entire sentences, causing even greater 
disparity. Such differences seem to violate the constitutional 
rights of due process and equal protection. State sentencing 
codes usually include various factors that can legitimately in-
fl uence the length of prison sentences, including:
The severity of the offense
 
■
The offender’s prior criminal record
 
■
Whether the offender used violence
 
■
Whether the offender used weapons
 
■
Whether the crime was committed for money
 
■
Research in fact shows a strong correlation among these 
legal variables and the type and length of sentence received. 
Judges seem less willing to use discretion in cases involving 
the most serious criminal charges, such as murder and rape, 
while employing greater control in minor cases. Similarly, 
prior record, another legal variable, plays an important role 
in sentencing outcomes. More than 80 percent of people 
with a prior felony conviction were put in prison if recon-
victed on another crime; in contrast, 60 percent of offenders 
with no prior convictions were incarcerated after a second 
felony conviction.35
While legal factors are important in sentencing deci-
sions, the suspicion remains, however, that such extralegal 
factors as age, race, gender, and economic status infl uence 
sentencing outcomes. These extralegal factors appear to 
infl uence sentencing because the inmate population is dis-
proportionately male, African American, young, and lower 
class. Although this phenomenon may be a result of discrim-
ination, it could also be simply a function of existing crime 
patterns—males, minorities, and members of the lower class 
commit the crimes that are most likely to result in prison 
sentences (homicide, rape, armed robbery, and so on).
Numerous studies have been conducted to determine the 
cause of sentencing disparity in the United States.36 Some 
have found a pattern of racial discrimination in sentenc-
ing, whereas others indicate that class bias exists.37 There 
is also considerable evidence being assembled that the race 
and class of the victim, not the offender, may be the most 
important factor in sentencing decisions. Crimes involving 
a white victim seem to be more heavily punished than those 
in which a minority group member is the target.38 Sentenc-
ing disparity is the topic of the Race, Culture, Gender, and 
Criminology feature “Does Race Matter?”
THE DEATH PENALTY
The most severe sentence used in the United States is capi-
tal punishment, or execution. More than 14,500 confi rmed 
executions have been carried out in America under civil 
authority, starting with the execution of Captain George 
Kendall in 1608; today there are more than 3,200 people 
on death row, and about 40 to 50 are executed each year. 
Most of these executions have been for murder and rape. 
However, in the past, federal, state, and military laws have 
conferred the death penalty for other crimes, including rob-
bery, kidnapping, treason (offenses against the federal gov-
ernment), espionage, and desertion from military service. 
Today, capital punishment is limited only to the crime of 
murder in the fi rst degree. In Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008), 
the Supreme Court barred capital punishment for child rap-
ists unless the rape resulted in (or intended to result in) the 
death of the child.39
Exhibit 18.3 sets out important facts on the way the 
death penalty is now being used.

Death Penalty Facts and Trends
 ■ In 2009, 52 inmates were executed, 15 more than in 
2008.
 ■ Almost half the executions took place in Texas.
 ■ Of those executed (all males), 23 were white, 22 were 
black, 7 were Hispanic.
 ■ Method: Lethal injection (51) electrocution (1).
 ■ Thirty-five states and the federal government retain the 
death penalty as a form of punishment, although some 
states have not used it in decades.
 ■ In the case of People v. Stephen LaValle (2004), a New 
York appellate court declared the state’s capital punish-
ment law unconstitutional, placing a moratorium on its use 
for the near term. In 2007, New Jersey became the first 
state to abolish capital punishment by law since the death 
penalty was reintroduced in the United States in 1972. In 
2009, New Mexico voted to abolish the death penalty.
 ■ Between 1977 and 2008, 7,658 people have been under 
sentence of death. Of these, 15 percent were executed, 
5 percent died from other causes, and 38 percent re-
ceived other dispositions.
 ■ Among inmates under sentence of death, 1 in 12 had a 
prior homicide conviction.

630  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
There are more minorities in prison per 
capita than whites, a condition that indi-
cates racial bias in sentencing. The prob-
lems of race disparity are disturbing when, 
as sociologist Bruce Western points out, by 
the time they reach their mid-30s, a full 
60 percent of black high school dropouts 
are either prisoners or ex-cons. This, West-
ern warns, has resulted in “a collective ex-
perience for young black men that is wholly 
different from the rest of American society.” 
Is Western’s analysis correct? Does race still 
matter in the sentencing process?
A number of research studies do find 
that race bias still exists in the judicial pro-
cess. In one recent study of federal sentenc-
ing, Jill Doerner and Stephen Demuth found 
that Hispanics and blacks receive harsher 
sentences on the whole than white defen-
dants. Similarly, Shawn Bushway and Anne 
Morrison Piehl studied sentencing outcomes 
in Maryland and found that, on average, Af-
rican Americans receive 20 percent longer 
sentences than whites, even when holding 
constant age, gender, and recommended 
sentence length. In a review of over 70 pub-
lished studies, Ojmarrh Mitchell found that, 
indeed, African Americans are sentenced 
more harshly than similarly situated white 
offenders. So the nagging issue of racial dis-
parity in sentencing still haunts the justice 
process.
Although this evidence of race bias ex-
ists, research on sentencing has failed to 
show a definitive pattern of racial discrimi-
nation. While some research does indicate 
that a defendant’s race has a direct impact 
on sentencing outcomes, other efforts show 
that the influence of race on sentencing is 
less clear-cut than anticipated. It is pos-
sible, the counter-argument goes, that the 
disproportionate number of minority group 
members in prison is not a function of racial 
bias by judges but reflects actual racial and 
ethnic differences in the crime rate: minor-
ity group members go to prison more often 
simply because they commit more crime.
Why does the critical issue of racial dis-
parity remain so murky? One reason may be 
that if disparity is a factor in sentencing, its 
cause may lie outside of judicial sentencing 
practices. Research efforts show that mi-
nority defendants suffer discrimination in a 
variety of early court actions that impact on 
sentencing decisions:
They are more likely to be detained be-
 
■
fore trial than whites.
Prosecutors are less likely to divert 
 
■
minorities from the legal system than 
whites.
Minorities have less money for bail and 
 
■
private attorneys.
It is also possible that some research 
efforts miss a racial effect because they 
use invalid measures of race. Some may 
combine Anglo and Hispanic cases into a 
single category of “white” defendants and 
then compare them with the sentencing 
of black defendants. Darrell Steffensmeier 
and Stephen Demuth’s analysis found that 
Hispanics are punished considerably more 
severely than non-Hispanic Anglos and that 
combining the two groups confuses and 
confounds the true ethnic and racial differ-
ences in sentencing.
The victim’s race may be a more criti-
cal factor in sentencing than the offender’s. 
Minority defendants are sanctioned more 
severely if their victim is white than if their 
target is a fellow minority group member; 
minorities who kill whites are more likely 
to get the death penalty than those who 
kill other minorities. Charles Crawford, Ted 
Chiricos, and Gary Kleck found that African 
American defendants are more likely to be 
prosecuted under habitual offender stat-
utes if they commit crimes where there is a 
greater likelihood of a white victim (larceny 
and burglary) than if they commit violent 
crimes that are largely intraracial. Where 
there is a perceived “racial threat,” punish-
ments are enhanced.
In sum, while the true association be-
tween race and sentencing remains to be 
established, there seems little question 
that a defendant’s race helps shape the 
contours of justice and plays an important 
role in the outcome of the adjudicatory pro-
cess. The impact of race on punishment 
outcome affects more than just the defen-
dant. As Bruce Western warns, by margin-
alizing and incarcerating so many African 
American men, communities are being de-
stabilized. And doing prison time, Western 
warns, can turn minor offenders into hard-
ened criminals, which removes any chance 
of rehabilitation and later opportunities. The 
prison boom, Western writes, “may be a 
self- defeating strategy for crime control.”
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Critics have called for change in the 
way federal sentencing guidelines are 
designed, because they punish crack 
possession more heavily than powdered 
cocaine possession. African Americans 
are more likely to use crack and whites 
to use powdered cocaine. Do you ap-
prove of such a sentencing change?
 2. Because of the lingering problem of 
racial and class bias in the sentenc-
ing process, one primary goal of the 
criminal justice system has been to 
reduce disparity by creating new forms 
of criminal sentences that limit judicial 
discretion and are aimed at uniformity 
and fairness. Can such measures as 
sentencing guidelines and mandatory 
sentences reduce race-based disparity?

CHAPTER 18 | Punishment and Correction  631
The Death Penalty Debate
The death penalty has long been one of the 
most controversial aspects of the justice sys-
tem, and it likely will continue to be a source 
of signifi cant debate.40
Arguments for the Death Penalty Various 
arguments have been offered in support of the 
death penalty:
Executions have always been used, and 
 
■
capital punishment is inherent in human 
nature. It is fair to punish the wicked, 
and consequently the death penalty is 
favored by most Americans and used 
around the world in many nations, in-
cluding Japan, which has an extremely 
low murder rate.41
The Bible describes methods of execut-
 
■
ing criminals. Many moral philosophers 
and religious leaders, such as Thomas 
More, John Locke, and Immanuel 
Kant, did not oppose the death pen-
alty; neither did the framers of the U.S. 
Constitution.
The death penalty also seems to be in 
 
■
keeping with the current mode of dis-
pensing punishment. Criminal law ex-
acts proportionately harsher penalties for 
crimes based on their seriousness; this 
practice is testimony to a retribution-
ist philosophy. Therefore, the harshest 
penalty for the most severe crime represents a logical 
step in the process. A mass murderer like Timothy 
McVeigh, the subject of the Profi les in Crime feature, 
deserves to be executed. Would it be fair to give him 
the same punishment as someone who commits a 
 burglary or steals a car?
The death penalty is sometimes the only real threat 
 
■
available to deter crime. For example, prison inmates 
serving life sentences can be controlled only if they 
know that further transgressions can lead to death. 
Or a person committing a crime that carries with it a 
long prison sentence might be more likely to kill wit-
nesses if the threat of death did not exist.
Death is the ultimate incapacitation. Some offenders 
 
■
are so dangerous that they can never be safely let out in 
society. The death penalty is a sure way of preventing 
these people from ever harming others. About 8 percent 
of prisoners under a sentence of death have prior ho-
micide convictions; if they had been executed for their 
fi rst offense, their victims would still be alive.42
The death penalty is cost effective. Considering the 
 
■
crowded prison system and the expense of keeping an 
inmate locked up for many years, an execution makes 
fi nancial sense.
Despite some allegations of racism, there appears to be 
 
■
little racial difference in the rate of capital sentencing 
over the past 30 years.
The feelings of the victim’s friends, families, and survi-
 
■
vors need to be considered. The death penalty brings 
them some form of closure, which a prison sentence 
cannot. Is it fair to them that their loved one is dead 
while the killer lives on in prison?43
In summary, supporters view capital punishment as the 
ultimate deterrent to crime. They believe that such a serious 
sanction prevents many potential criminals from taking the 
lives of innocent victims. The justifi cation for the death pen-
alty, therefore, relies on the premise that sacrifi cing the lives 
of a few evil people is a cost effective way to save the lives of 
many innocent ones.
Arguments Against the Death Penalty There are several 
compelling arguments against the death penalty, which are 
reviewed here:
The death penalty has little deterrent effect.
 
■
44 Although 
it is still uncertain why the threat of capital punishment 
has failed as a deterrent, the cause may lie in the nature 
of homicide itself. Murder is often an expressive “crime 
One argument against the death penalty is the fear that an innocent person may be 
executed for a crime he did not commit—and mistakes do happen. Joseph White 
spent nearly 20 years behind bars after he was wrongly convicted with five other 
people, in 1985, of the rape and murder of Helen Wilson. Here, White displays a 
picture of himself and his infant son taken before his arrest, during a testimony 
before the Judiciary Committee in Lincoln, Nebraska, February 19, 2009. White told 
the committee he missed 20 years of his son’s life. The testimony was on LB260, a 
bill that provides for a minimum of $50,000 compensation for each year an innocent 
person is incarcerated and an additional $50,000 for each year a person served on 
death row. LB260 was signed into law on April 8, 2009, and is retroactive, allowing 
the six people wrongly convicted in the 1985 rape and murder of Helen Wilson to 
receive compensation.

Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing
On the morning of April 19, 1995, an ex-
Army soldier and security guard named 
Timothy McVeigh parked a rented Ryder 
truck in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building in downtown Oklahoma City. Inside 
the vehicle was a powerful bomb made out 
of a deadly combination of agricultural fer-
tilizer, diesel fuel, and other chemicals. Af-
ter he ignited timed fuses, McVeigh calmly 
got out, locked the door, and left the area 
in a getaway car. At precisely 9:02 A.M., 
the bomb exploded and within minutes 
the Federal Building had been reduced to 
rubble, dozens of cars were incinerated, 
and more than 300 nearby buildings were 
damaged or destroyed. The human toll was 
still more devastating: 168 people lost their 
lives, including 19 children in the building’s 
day care center, with several hundred more 
injured. The bombing remains the worst 
act of homegrown terrorism in the nation’s 
history.
FBI investigators located the rear axle 
of the Ryder truck, which yielded a vehi-
cle identification number that was traced 
to a body shop in Junction City, Kansas. 
Employees at the shop helped the FBI 
quickly put together a composite draw-
ing of the man who had rented the van. 
When agents showed the drawing around 
town, local hotel employees supplied a 
name: Tim McVeigh. Ironically, McVeigh 
was already in jail. He’d been pulled over 
about 80 miles north of Oklahoma City by 
an observant Oklahoma State Trooper who 
noticed a missing license plate on his yel-
low Mercury Marquis. McVeigh had a con-
cealed weapon and was arrested. It was 
just 90 minutes after the bombing. It turns 
out that McVeigh held extremist ideologies 
and was seething with anger over the gov-
ernment’s siege at Waco two years earlier.

were a brutal and common practice to stifl e any thought 
of escapes or revolt.56
Critics also question whether the general public gives 
 
■
blanket approval to the application of capital punish-
ment. European Americans support capital punishment 
more than African Americans regardless of income or 
status.57
While the Bible and religious leaders of bygone days 
 
■
may have supported the death penalty, religious people 
today, especially those who have a personal relationship 
with a loving God, tend to oppose the use of capital 
punishment.58
Support for capital punishment among whites is 
 
■
skewed by racial attitudes; those holding racist attitudes 
are much more likely to support the death penalty.59
Research suggests that most people may accept capital 
 
■
punishment in principle but also believe it should 
be used only rarely.60 Surveys show that the general 
public is usually willing to forgo use of the death 
penalty when given choices of other penalties, such 
as life in prison without parole and compensation 
to the victim’s family.61 In a 2002 case, Kelly v. South 
Carolina, the Supreme Court ruled that jurors must be 
apprised of state laws that prohibit people convicted 
of fi rst-degree murder from being eligible for parole.62 
Abolitionists believe that jurors who understand 
that dangerous criminals will never be released from 
prison may be less willing to recommend the death 
penalty.
Opponents object to the fi nality of the death penalty. 
 
■
It of course precludes any possibility of rehabilitation. 
Studies indicate that death row inmates released be-
cause of legal changes rarely recidivate and present little 
threat to the community.63
“It is better that a thousand guilty go free than one in-
 
■
nocent man be executed” is a statement abolitionists 
often make. It is quite possible for an innocent person 
to be convicted of crime; once the person is executed, 
the mistake can never be rectifi ed.64 Many people con-
victed of murder are later released because of mistaken 
identity or perjured testimony.65 Some 250 wrongfully 
convicted criminals have been exonerated in recent 
years because of DNA evidence.66
The death penalty is capricious; receiving death is 
 
■
similar to losing a lottery.67 Of the thousands of people 
convicted on murder charges, only about 100 are sen-
tenced to death; more are sentenced to jail for their 
crimes. Is it fair to give one person who has taken a life 
a jail sentence into the prison community and execute 
another?
Abolitionists claim that capital punishment has never 
 
■
been proven to be a deterrent, any more than has life 
in prison. In fact, capital punishment may encourage 
murder because it sets an example of violence and bru-
tality.68 And when research does show a deterrent effect, 
it is often minor and insignifi cant.69
kill its enemies, so can they.46 The brutalization effect 
means that after an execution, murders may increase, 
causing even more deaths of innocent victims.47 There 
may even be a vicarious brutalization effect in which 
murder rates in a state that does not practice capital 
punishment are infl uenced by news reports of execu-
tions in states that do.48
Capital punishment may be tarnished by gender, ra-
 
■
cial, ethnic, and other biases.49 There is evidence that 
homicides with male offenders and female victims are 
more likely to result in a death sentence than homicides 
with female offenders or male victims.50 Though African 
Americans make up less than 15 percent of the popula-
tion, they account for about half of all capital punishment 
sentences.
Homicides involving strangers are more likely to re-
 
■
sult in a death sentence than homicides involving 
nonstrangers and acquaintances. Prosecutors are more 
likely to recommend the death sentence for people who 
kill white victims than they are in any other racial com-
bination of victim and criminal, for example, whites 
who kill blacks.51
Capital punishment may escalate the seriousness of 
 
■
criminal acts. Some critics fear that the introduction 
of capital punishment encourages criminals to escalate 
their violent behavior, consequently putting police of-
fi cers at risk. A suspect who kills someone during a 
botched robbery may be inclined to “fi re away” upon 
encountering police rather than surrender peace-
fully; the killer faces the death penalty already, what 
does he have to lose? Geoffrey Rapp studied the effect 
of capital punishment on the killings of police and 
found that, all other things being equal, the greater 
the number of new inmates on death row, the greater 
the number of police offi cers killed by citizens.52 Rapp 
concludes that the death penalty seems to create an 
extremely dangerous environment for law enforcement 
offi cers because it (a) does not deter criminals and 
(b) may lull offi cers into a false sense of security be-
cause they believe that the death penalty will deter 
violence directed against them and may cause them to 
let their guard down.
The death penalty is brutal and demeaning. Even if the 
 
■
general public voices approval of the death penalty, 
abolitionists argue that “social vengeance by death is 
a primitive way of revenge which stands in the way of 
moral progress.”53 And while early religious leaders ac-
cepted the death penalty, others (such as the Catholic 
Church) condemn the practice.54 In The Contradictions 
of American Capital Punishment, Franklin Zimring links 
America’s obsession with the death penalty, unique 
among westernized nations, with its vigilante tradition, 
in which people on the frontier took justice into their 
own hands, assuming that their targets were always 
guilty as charged.55 The death penalty was widely prac-
ticed against slaves, and at one time mass executions

The governor has contacted you, asking for your 
professional opinion. She has read a paper by 
criminologists William Bowers and Glenn Pierce, 
who argue that far from being a deterrent, capi-
tal punishment actually produces more violence 
than it prevents; they label this the “brutalization 
effect.” Executions, they say, actually increase 
murder rates because they raise the general 
violence level in society and because violence-
prone people identify with the executioner, not 
with the target of the death penalty. Consequently, 
when violence-prone people are confronted or their authority is 
challenged, they execute their challengers in the same manner 
that the state executes people who violate its rules. The state is just 
about to execute a notorious serial killer who has been convicted 
of the murder of 10 young women. On the one 
hand, the victims’ families demand justice for 
the death of their loved ones and want this 
man dead. On the other hand, assuming that 
the “brutalization effect” is valid, the killer’s 
execution will actually mean an increase in the 
state’s murder rate.

age and mental state) circumstances are taken into ac-
count.71 However, the Court has also placed limitations 
on the use of capital punishment: the mentally ill or men-
tally challenged cannot be executed.72 Similarly, in Roper 
v. Simmons (2005), the Court set a limit of 18 years as 
the age of defendants who could be sentenced to death.73
The Court said that executing young teens violates “the 
evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a 
maturing society,” and that American society regards ju-
veniles as less responsible than adult criminals. So while 
capital punishment remains a legal option, 
its use has been limited and curtailed by le-
gal restrictions, public opinion, and legisla-
tive rulings.

county jail, which holds misdemeanants serving their sen-
tences, as well as detainees awaiting trial who have not been 
released on bail. State and federal prisons incarcerate felons for 
extended periods.
The correctional system also includes parole and after-
care agencies that supervise former inmates who have been 
given early release from their sentences. These institutions 
are discussed in the next sections.
PROBATION
Probation provides offenders with the opportunity to prove 
themselves, gives them a second chance, and allows them 
to be closely supervised by trained personnel who can help 
them reestablish proper forms of behavior in the commu-
nity. Even dangerous offenders who might normally be sent 
to a penal institution can be successfully rehabilitated in 
the community if given the proper balance of supervision, 
treatment, and control.
Considering these benefi ts, it’s not surprising that the pro-
bation population has undergone continual growth. While 
growth in the probation population has slowed, more than 
4 million people are currently on probation, and the adult 
probation population has grown signifi cantly during the past 
decade at a pace outstripping other forms of correctional 
treatment (see Figure 18.2). More than 2 million people are 
still being placed on probation annually. Without probation, 
are state-run institutions.74 This vast correctional system 
provides many services in programs differentiated by level 
of security and intrusiveness. The least secure and intrusive 
programs involve community supervision by probation of-
fi cers. Some offenders who need more secure treatment or 
control are placed under house arrest or held in community 
correctional centers. Those who require the most secure 
settings are placed in a secure incarceration facility. Felons 
are usually incarcerated in a state or federal prison; misde-
meanants are housed in county jails or reformatories. There 
are now more than 7 million people in some form of cor-
rectional supervision and the numbers have been increasing 
despite a decade-long decline in the crime rate.
The entire correctional system has been a source of 
great controversy. Conservatives charge that the justice 
system is often too liberal and that serious offenders are all 
too often granted probation. Getting tough, they suggest, 
is the only way to keep crime rates down. They point out 
the fact that as the prison population has increased dur-
ing the past decade, the crime rate has fallen. In contrast, 
liberals view prisons as warehouses that, far from helping 
rehabilitate inmates, are places of violence and degrada-
tion. Rather than deter people from future criminality, a 
prison stay actually reinforces or encourages their crimi-
nal offending.75 And though it might surprise some “get 
tough” politicians, the general public may not be ready to 
embrace a prison-building boom at the expense of reha-
bilitation efforts.76
Contemporary Corrections
Correctional treatment can be di-
vided today into community-based 
programs and secure confinement. 
Community-based corrections in-
clude probation, which involves su-
pervision in the community under 
the control of the sentencing court. A 
probationer is set free to work, go to 
school, and resume a normal life rou-
tine if he or she agrees to obey a set 
of rules handed down by the court—
e.g., stay sober and drug free, main-
tain steady employment, do not leave 
the area without permission. In addi-
tion, there are an array of sentencing 
add-ons—alternative or intermediate 
sanctions—that provide greater su-
pervision and treatment than tradi-
tional probation but are less intrusive 
than incarceration (e.g., house arrest, 
electronic monitoring).
In addition to community cor-
rections, there are also institutions 
of secure confinement, including the

or her to require legal assistance.
Success of Probation
Probation is the most commonly used alternative sentence for 
a number of reasons: it is humane, it helps offenders maintain 
community and family ties, and it is cost effective. But although 
it is unquestionably inexpensive, is probation successful? 
If most probation orders fail, the costs of repeated criminal-
ity would certainly outweigh the cost savings of a probation 
sentence. Overall, most probation orders do seem successful. 
National data indicate that about 60 percent of probationers 
successfully complete their probationary sentence while about 
40 percent are rearrested, violate probation rules, or abscond.78 
Most revocations occur for technical violations that occur dur-
ing the fi rst three months of the probation sentence.79
How do serious offenders fare on probation? In an often-
cited 1985 study, Joan Petersilia and her colleagues at the Rand 
Corporation followed the careers of 1,672 California men 
granted probation for felony offenses.80 They found that about 
two-thirds were rearrested, half convicted, and one-third rein-
carcerated, most for serious crimes such as larceny, burglary, 
and robbery. The Petersilia research was an early indication 
that felons often qualifi ed for and later failed on probation.
While the failure rate found by Petersilia seems disturb-
ingly high, even the most serious criminals who receive 
probation are less likely to recidivate 
than those who are sent to prison for 
committing similar crimes.81 For ex-
ample, when Christopher Krebs and his 
associates carefully compared treatment 
outcomes of large groups of drug-in-
volved offenders in the state of Florida, 
they found that institutional treatment 
cost three times as much as commu-
nity-based treatment, but was actu-
ally less successful; inmates showed no 
particular improvement after attending 
institutional drug treatment programs, 
while probationers had a positive result. 
The conclusion: the use of community-
based treatment can result in signifi cant 
public safety and justice system cost 
savings at far less cost than locking up 
offenders.82
Because it costs far less to maintain 
an offender in the community than in 
prison, and because prison overcrowd-
ing continues, there is constant eco-
nomic pressure to grant probation to 
serious felony offenders. Even if proba-
tion is no more successful than prison, it 
costs less and is therefore extremely at-
tractive to policymakers.
the correctional system would rapidly become even more 
overcrowded, overly expensive, and unmanageable.
Probation usually involves the suspension of the offend-
er’s sentence in return for the promise of good behavior in the 
community under the supervision of a probation department. 
In some cases, the offender is fi rst sentenced to a prison term, 
and then the sentence is suspended and the defendant placed 
on probation. In others, the imposition of a prison sentence is 
delayed or suspended while the offender is put on probation. 
Probation is not limited to minor or petty criminals; about 
one-third of people convicted of felony offenses receive a sen-
tence of probation only with no prison or jail time.
As practiced in all 50 states and by the federal govern-
ment, probation involves a contract between the court and 
the offender in which the latter is required to obey a set of 
rules or conditions required by the court. If the rules are 
violated, and especially if the probationer commits another 
criminal offense, probation may be revoked; this means that 
the contract is terminated, and the original sentence is en-
forced. If an offender on probation commits a second of-
fense that is more severe than the fi rst, he or she may be 
indicted, tried, and sentenced on that second offense.
Probation may also be revoked simply because its rules 
and conditions have not been met, even if the offender has 
not committed another crime. In a series of cases, most im-
portantly Gagnon v. Scarpelli,77 the Supreme Court ruled 
that before probation can be revoked, the offender must (1) 
be given a hearing before the sentencing court and (2) be

CHAPTER 18 | Punishment and Correction  637
INTERMEDIATE SANCTIONS
At a time when overcrowding has produced a crisis in the 
nation’s prison system, alternative sanctions are viewed as 
a new form of corrections that falls somewhere between 
probation and incarceration.83 Alternative sanctions include 
fi nes, forfeiture, home confi nement, electronic monitoring, 
intensive probation supervision, restitution, community 
corrections, and boot camps.
The development of these intermediate sanctions can 
be tied to a number of different sources. Primary is the need 
to develop alternatives to prisons, which have proved both 
ineffective and injurious. Research indicates that about half 
of all prison inmates are likely to be rearrested and returned 
to prison, many soon after their release from an institution.84 
High revocation rates indicate that probation alone may not 
be an effective solution to the prison crowding problem. 
Therefore, a sanction that falls somewhere between prison 
and probation might be a more effective alternative to tradi-
tional forms of correction.
Intermediate sanctions also meet the need to develop 
punishments that are fair, equitable, and proportional. It 
seems unfair to treat both a rapist and a shoplifter with the 
same type of sentence, considering the differences in their 
criminal acts. Intermediate sanctions can provide the succes-
sive steps for a meaningful “ladder” of scaled punishments 
outside prison (Figure 18.3), thereby restoring fairness and 
equity to nonincarceration sentences.85 For example, a forger 
may be ordered to make restitution to the victim, and an 
abusive husband may be ordered to reside in a community 
correctional center, whereas a rapist would be sent to state 
prison. This feature of intermediate sanctions allows judges 
to fit the punishment to the crime without resorting to a 
prison sentence. Intermediate sanctions can be designed to 
be punitive by increasing punishments for people whose se-
rious or repeat crimes make straight probation sentences in-
appropriate yet for whom prison sentences would be unduly 
harsh and dysfunctional.86 In fact, the punitive nature of in-
termediate sanctions is not lost on offenders, some of whom 
prefer prison to the new, tougher forms of probation.87
The most likely candidates are convicted criminals who 
would normally be sent to prison but either have a low risk 
of recidivating or pose little threat to society (such as non-
violent property offenders). Used in this sense, intermedi-
ate sanctions are a viable solution to the critical problem of 
prison overcrowding.
The following sections more thoroughly discuss the 
forms of intermediate sanctions in use.
Fines
Fines are monetary payments imposed on an offender as an 
intermediate punishment for criminal acts. They are a di-
rect offshoot of the early common-law practice requiring

compensation to the victim and the state for criminal acts. 
Although fines are most commonly used in misdemean-
ors, they are also frequently employed in felonies where 
the offender benefi ted fi nancially. Fines may be used as a 
sole sanction or combined with other punishment, such 
as probation or confi nement. Quite commonly judges levy 
other monetary sanctions along with fi nes—such as court

638  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Split Sentencing and Shock 
Probation
Split sentencing and shock probation are alternative sanc-
tions that allow judges to grant offenders community release 
only after they have sampled prison life. These sanctions 
are based on the premise that if offenders are given a taste 
of incarceration suffi cient to “shock” them into law-abiding 
behavior, they will be reluctant to violate the rules of proba-
tion or commit other criminal acts.
In a number of states and in the federal criminal code, 
a jail term can actually be a condition of probation; this is 
known as split sentencing. Under current federal practices, 
about 25 percent of all convicted federal offenders receive 
some form of split sentence, including both prison and/or 
jail as a condition of probation.
Another approach, known as shock probation, involves 
resentencing an offender after a short prison stay. The shock 
comes because the offender originally receives a long maxi-
mum sentence but is then eligible for release to community 
supervision at the discretion of the judge (usually within 
90 days of incarceration). Used in a number of states, shock 
probation has been praised as a program that limits prison 
time and allows offenders to be quickly integrated into the 
community, a mechanism that can maintain family ties, 
and a way of reducing prison populations and the costs of 
corrections.92
Intensive Probation Supervision
Intensive probation supervision (IPS) has been imple-
mented in some form in most states, involving small 
caseloads of 15 to 40 clients who are kept under close 
watch by probation officers. The primary goals of IPS 
include:
Diversion.
 
■
 Without intensive supervision, clients would 
normally have been sent to already overcrowded pris-
ons or jails.
Control.
 
■
 High-risk offenders can stay in the community 
under much closer security than traditional probation 
efforts can provide.
Reintegration.
 
■
 Offenders can maintain community ties 
and be reoriented toward a more productive life while 
avoiding the pain of imprisonment.
Who is eligible for IPS? Most programs have admis-
sions criteria based on the nature of the offense and 
the offender’s criminal background. Some programs ex-
clude violent offenders; others will not consider sub-
stance abusers. In contrast, some jurisdictions do not 
exclude offenders based on their prior criminal history. 
About 60 percent of IPS programs exclude offenders who 
have already violated probation orders or otherwise failed 
on probation.
costs, public defender fees, probation and treatment fees, 
and victim restitution—to increase the force of the fi nancial 
punishment.88
Forfeiture
Another fi nancially based alternative sanction is criminal 
(in personam) and civil (in rem) forfeiture. Both involve 
the seizure of goods and instrumentalities related to the 
commission or outcome of a criminal act. For example, 
federal law provides that after arresting drug traffi ckers, 
the government may seize the boat they used to import 
the narcotics, the car they used to carry them overland, 
the warehouse in which they were stored, and the home 
paid for with drug money; upon conviction, the drug 
dealers permanently lose ownership of these instrumen-
talities of crime.
The use of forfeiture was introduced in American law 
with the passage of the Racketeer Infl uenced and Corrupt 
Organizations (RICO) and the Continuing Criminal Enter-
prises Acts, both of which allow the seizure of any property 
derived from illegal enterprises or conspiracies.
Restitution
Another popular intermediate sanction is restitution, used 
in about one-third of felony probation cases, which can take 
the form of requiring convicted defendants to either repay 
the victims of crime (monetary restitution) or serve the 
community to compensate for their criminal acts (commu-
nity service restitution).89
Restitution programs offer convicted offenders a chance 
to avoid jail or prison sentences or lengthy probation. Res-
titution may also be used as a diversionary device that al-
lows some offenders to avoid a criminal record altogether. 
In this instance, a judge continues the case “without a fi nd-
ing” while the defendant completes the restitution order; af-
ter the probation department determines that restitution has 
been made, the case is dismissed.90
Because restitution appears to benefi t the crime vic-
tim, the offender, the criminal justice system, and society 
as a whole, national interest in the concept has been tre-
mendous. Restitution is inexpensive, avoids stigma, and 
helps compensate crime victims. Offenders doing com-
munity service have worked in schools, hospitals, and 
nursing homes. Helping them avoid jail can save the pub-
lic thousands of dollars that would have maintained them 
in secure institutions, free needed resources, and give the 
community the feeling that equity has been returned to 
the justice system. Most offenders successfully complete 
their restitution orders and consequently have equal or 
lower recidivism rates when compared to control groups 
of various kinds.91

into going straight. Tough physical training is designed to 
promote responsibility and improve decision-making skills, 
build self-confi dence, and teach socialization skills. Inmates 
are treated with rough intensity by drill masters, who may 
call them names and punish the entire group for the failure 
of one of its members.
Is shock incarceration a correctional panacea or another 
fad doomed to failure? The results so far have not been en-
couraging. The costs of boot camps are no lower than those 
of traditional prisons, but because sentences are shorter, 
boot camps provide long-term savings. Some programs suf-
fer high failure-to-complete rates, which makes program 
evaluations diffi cult (even if “graduates” are successful, it is 
possible that success is achieved because troublesome cases 
drop out and are placed in the general inmate population).94 
Because of these sketchy results, the future of the boot camp 
approach is clouded; a number of states and the federal gov-
ernment have terminated their boot camp programs.95
JAILS
The jail is a secure institution used to (a) detain offenders 
before trial if they cannot afford or are not eligible for bail 
and (b) house misdemeanants sentenced to terms of one 
year or less, as well as some nonserious felons. The jail is 
a multipurpose correctional institution whose other main 
functions are set out in Exhibit 18.4.
The jail originated in Europe in the sixteenth century 
and was used to house those awaiting trial and punish-
ment. Jails were not used to house sentenced criminals 
because at that time punishment was achieved by fi ne, ex-
ile, corporal punishment, or death. Throughout their his-
tory, jails have been considered hellholes of pestilence and 
cruelty. In early English history, they housed offenders 
awaiting trial, as well as vagabonds, debtors, the mentally 
ill, and assorted others.96 The early colonists adopted the 
European custom of detaining prisoners in jail. As noted 
previously, William Penn instituted the fi rst jails to house 
convicted offenders while they worked off their sentences. 
The Walnut Street Jail, built in 1790, is considered the 
fi rst modern jail.
Jail Populations
There has been a national effort to remove as many people 
from local jails as possible through bail reform measures 
and pretrial diversion. Nonetheless, jail populations have re-
mained high due in part to the increased use of mandatory 
jail sentences for such common crimes as drunk driving and 
the use of local jails to house inmates for whom there is no 
Home Confinement/Electronic 
Monitoring
A number of states, including Florida, Oklahoma, Oregon, 
Kentucky, and California, have developed home confi ne-
ment (HC) programs (also called house arrest or home 
detention) as an intermediate sanction. The HC concept 
requires convicted offenders to spend extended periods in 
their own homes as an alternative to incarceration. For ex-
ample, an individual convicted of drunk driving might be 
sentenced to spend the period between 6 P.M. Friday and 
8 A.M. Monday and every weekday after 5:30 P.M. in his or 
her home for the next six months.
For house arrest to work, sentencing authorities must be 
assured that arrestees are actually at home during their as-
signed times. Random calls and visits are one way to check 
on compliance with house arrest orders. However, a more 
advanced method of control has been the introduction of 
electronic monitoring (EM) devices to manage offender 
obedience to home confi nement orders.
Growth in the number of electronically monitored of-
fenders has been explosive. EM has the benefi ts of relatively 
low cost and high security while at the same time helping 
offenders avoid imprisonment in overcrowded, dangerous 
state facilities.
Residential Community Corrections
A more secure intermediate sanction is a sentence to a resi-
dential community corrections (RCC) program. These pro-
grams feature freestanding nonsecure buildings that are not 
part of a prison or jail and that house pretrial and adjudi-
cated adults. The residents regularly depart to work, to at-
tend school, and/or to participate in community corrections 
activities and programs.93 Today the community correctional 
facility provides intermediate sanctions as well as a prerelease 
center for those about to be paroled from prison. RCC has 
been used as a direct sentencing option for judges who be-
lieve particular offenders need a correctional alternative half-
way between traditional probation and a stay in prison.
Placement in an RCC center can be used as a condition 
of probation for offenders who need a nonsecure commu-
nity facility that provides a more structured treatment envi-
ronment than traditional probation.
Boot Camps/Shock Incarceration
Another intermediate sanction gaining popularity around 
the United States is boot camps or shock incarceration 
(SI). These programs typically include youthful, fi rst-time 
offenders and feature military discipline and physical train-
ing. The concept is that short periods (90 to 180 days) of 
high-intensity exercise and work will shock young criminals

times more likely than whites, nearly three times more likely 
than Hispanics, and over nine times more likely than per-
sons of other races to have been in jail; this pattern has not 
changed for the past decade. Disproportionate minority rep-
resentation in jail may be responsible, in part, for race-based 
sentencing disparity: pretrial detainees tend to get longer 
sentences and are more likely to be incarcerated than those 
released on bail. Minority over-representation in jail may be 
the fi rst step to subsequent over-representation in prison.
PRISONS
State and federal governments maintain closed correctional 
facilities to house convicted felons. Usually called prisons 
or penitentiaries, these institutions have become familiar to 
most people as harsh, frightening places fi lled with danger-
ous men and women. San Quentin (California), Attica (New 
York), Joliet (Illinois), and Cedar Junction (Massachusetts) 
are but a few of the large state and federal prisons made well 
known by fi lms, books, and other media.
Though the crime rate has fallen sharply for the past 
decade, the prison population has continued to rise. One 
reason is that there has been a recent trend for defendants 
convicted of a felony to be sent to prison (instead of jail 
or probation), a fi nding that may refl ect a more conserva-
tive view of crime control. Similarly, increases in the prison 
population may also be linked to changing sentencing poli-
cies that force inmates to spend more time behind bars be-
fore they are released. And as more inmates are released on 
parole, the increasing number of returning parole violators 
has also helped fuel the growth in the prison inmate popu-
lation. Though the rapid increase in the prison population 
has fi nally begun to stabilize, the inmate population remains 
quite high; more than 1.6 million people are still under lock 
and key.
Types of Prisons
Prisons are usually categorized according to their level of 
security and inmate populations as maximum-, medium-, 
and minimum-security institutions. Large maximum-secu-
rity prisons are surrounded by high walls, have elaborate 
security measures and armed guards, and house inmates 
classifi ed as potentially dangerous. High security and stone 
walls give the inmates the sense that the facility is impreg-
nable and reassure citizens that convicts will be completely 
incapacitated. During the day, the inmates engage in closely 
controlled activities: meals, workshops, education, and so 
on. Rule violators may be confined to their cells; work-
ing and other shared recreational activities are viewed as 
privileges.
EXHIBIT 18.4 
Jail Functions and Services
Jails are locally operated correctional facilities that:
 ■  Confine persons before or after adjudication. Inmates 
sentenced to jail usually have a sentence of one year 
or less.
 ■ Receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them 
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing.
 ■ Readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and 
absconders.
 ■ Temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile 
authorities.
 ■ Hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to ap-
propriate mental health facilities.
 ■ Hold individuals for the military, for protective custody for 
contempt, and for the courts as witnesses.
 ■ Release convicted inmates to the community upon com-
pletion of sentence.
 ■ Transfer inmates to federal, state, or other authorities.
 ■ House inmates for federal, state, or other authorities be-
cause of crowding of their facilities.
 ■ Sometimes operate community-based programs as alter-
natives to incarceration.

room in state prisons. Today there are close to 800,000 peo-
ple in jail on a daily basis, including more than 7,000 juve-
niles, despite a 20-year campaign by the federal government 
to remove minors from adult institutions.97 Each year there 
are about 13 million jail admissions, and about the same 
number of releases, giving jails a “revolving door” image.

CHAPTER 18 | Punishment and Correction  641
Twenty years ago, only one state had a supermax prison; 
today two-thirds of the states and the federal government 
operate some type of supermax prison or housing.98
The 484-bed federal facility in Florence, Colorado, is the 
model for the supermax prison. It has the most sophisticated 
security measures in the United States, including 168 video 
cameras and 1,400 electronically controlled gates. Inside the 
cells all furniture is unmovable; the desk, bed, and TV stand 
are made of cement. All potential weapons—including soap 
dishes, toilet seats, and toilet handles—have been removed. 
The cement walls are 5,000-pound quality, and steel bars are 
placed so they crisscross every 8 inches inside the walls. Cells 
are angled so that inmates can see neither each other nor the 
outside scenery. This cuts down on communications and de-
nies inmates a sense of location, in order to prevent escapes.
Getting out of the prison seems impossible. There are 
six guard towers at different heights to prevent air attacks. 
To get out, the inmates would have to pass through seven 
3-inch-thick steel doors, each of which can be opened only 
after the previous one has closed. If a guard tower is ever 
seized, all controls are switched to the next station. If the 
whole prison is seized, it can be controlled from the out-
side. It appears that the only way out is via good works and 
behavior, through which an inmate can earn transfer to an-
other prison within three years.
Some recent research by Daniel Mears and his colleagues 
fi nds that supermax prisons produce a mixed bag of results. 
Medium-security prisons 
have similar protective measures 
but usually contain less violent 
inmates. Consequently, they are 
more likely to offer a variety of 
treatment and educational pro-
grams to their residents. They 
may be similar in appearance to 
the maximum-security prison; 
however, security and atmo-
sphere are neither so tense nor so 
vigilant. Medium-security prisons 
are also surrounded by walls, but 
there may be fewer guard tow-
ers or other security precautions. 
Visitor privileges may be more 
extensive, and personal contact 
may be allowed; in a maximum-
security prison, visitors may be 
separated from inmates by Plexi-
glas or other barriers (to prohibit 
the passing of contraband). Al-
though most prisoners are housed 
in cells, individual honor rooms 
in medium-security prisons are 
used to reward those who make 
exemplary rehabilitation efforts. 
Finally, medium-security prisons 
promote greater treatment efforts, 
and the relaxed atmosphere allows freedom of movement for 
rehabilitation workers and other therapeutic personnel.
Minimum-security prisons operate without armed 
guards or walls; usually they are constructed in compounds 
surrounded by chain-link fences. Minimum-security pris-
ons house the most trustworthy and least violent offenders; 
white-collar criminals may be their most common occu-
pants. Inmates may be transferred to these nonrestrictive 
institutions as a reward for good behavior prior to their re-
lease. A great deal of personal freedom is allowed inmates. 
Instead of being marched to activities by guards, they are 
summoned by bells or loudspeaker announcements and 
assemble on their own. Work furloughs and educational 
releases are encouraged, and vocational training is of the 
highest level. Minimum-security prisons have been scoffed 
at for being too much like country clubs; some federal fa-
cilities catering to white-collar criminals even have tennis 
courts and pools. Yet they remain prisons, and the isolation 
and loneliness of prison life deeply affects the inmates at 
these facilities. And, of course, if an inmate cannot adjust 
to the relaxed security or attempts escape, he or she will be 
transferred to a higher-security institution.
Super-Maximum Prisons These high-security institu-
tions can be independent correctional centers or locked 
wings of existing prisons operating under such names 
as the “secure housing unit” or “maximum control unit.” 
Though the growth in the prison population has stopped, a number of states are having problems 
coping with the existing inmate population. Here, inmates sit in their triple bunks in the California State 
Prison, Los Angeles. A panel of federal judges ruled that the overcrowding in California prisons 
constituted a violation of the Eighth Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishment. 
The judges ordered California to release 40,000 inmates over two years. But lawyers for the state 
appealed and the case is now at the Supreme Court. Lawyers for the prisoners argued that state 
prisons are housing twice as many prisoners as they were built to contain, and, as a result, the safety 
of prisoners, guards, and prison personnel is in jeopardy.

642  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
for inmates who are within three years of parole.101 By 2000, 
264 privately operated facilities were under contract with 
state or federal authorities to house prisoners.102 Today, pri-
vately run prisons hold many thousands of inmates. Cor-
rections Corporation of America is the largest private-prison 
operator in the United States, with about 66 facilities; about 
60,000 inmates are currently under the company’s supervi-
sion. Its main rival, Geo, currently operates 62 correctional 
and residential treatment facilities with capacity of about 
51,000 beds in the United States, Australia, South Africa, 
Canada, and Britain. In 2008, Geo built or expanded eight 
facilities in Georgia, Texas, and Mississippi and plans seven 
more expansions or new prisons. Also in 2008, Geo Group 
was awarded a contract by Florida’s Department of Manage-
ment Services to design and build a 2,000-bed special-needs 
prison in that state. Cornell Companies, the nation’s third-
largest prison company, recently broke ground on a 1,250-
bed private prison for men in Hudson, Colorado. Cornell 
has contracts to operate 82 facilities in 18 states and the 
District of Columbia with a service capacity of 19,500.103
Private facilities span the full range of correctional in-
stitutions. In addition to running stand-alone institutions, 
some correctional institutions outsource services such as 
medical care or food supply to private for-profi t companies.
Although privately run institutions have been around 
for a few years, their increased use may present a number of 
problems. Will private providers be able to effectively evalu-
ate programs, knowing that a negative evaluation might 
cause them to lose their contracts? Will they skimp on ser-
vices and programs to reduce costs? Might they not skim off 
the easy cases and leave the hardcore inmates for state care? 
And will the need to keep business booming require widen-
ing the net to fi ll empty cells? Some private service provid-
ers have been sued because their services were inadequate, 
causing harm to inmates.104
The notion of running prisons for profi t may be unpal-
atable to large segments of the population. However, is this 
much different from a private hospital or college, both of 
which offer services also provided by the state? The issues 
that determine the future of private corrections may be ef-
ficiency and cost effectiveness, not fairness and morality. 
Privately run correctional institutions have been found to 
provide better services at lower cost than public facilities.105 
They may experience some of the same problems as state-
run institutions, but there is little conclusive evidence that 
they cannot operate as or even more effi ciently than tradi-
tional institutions.106
In the abstract, a private correctional enterprise may 
be an attractive alternative to a costly correctional system, 
but these legal, administrative, and cost issues need to be 
resolved before private prisons can become widespread.107 
A balance must be reached between the need for a private 
business to make a profi t and the integrity of a prison ad-
ministration that must be concerned with such complex 
issues as security, rehabilitation, and dealing with highly 
dangerous people in a closed environment.108
Mears and Jamie Watson conducted surveys of correctional 
offi cials and found that supermax prisons may actually en-
hance the quality of life of inmates and consequently im-
prove their mental health. Supermax prisons increase 
privacy, reduce danger, and even provide creature comforts 
such as TV sets that are unavailable in general population 
prisons. Staff report less stress and fear because they have to 
contend with fewer disruptive inmates.
On the other hand, Mears and Watson found that su-
permax prisons also bring some unintended negative con-
sequences. Staff may have too much control over inmates, 
a condition that damages staff–inmate relationships. Long 
hours of isolation may be associated with mental illness and 
psychological disturbances. Supermax inmates seem to have 
a more diffi cult time readjusting upon release. A stay in a 
supermax prison inhibits reintegration into other prisons, 
communities, and families. In another study, Mears and 
 Jennifer Castro surveyed wardens and found that although 
they seem to favor supermax prisons, they also express con-
cern that the general public believes that supermax institu-
tions are inhumane, that they drain limited funds away from 
state budgets, and that they produce increases in litigation 
and court interventions as well as increased recidivism and 
reentry failure among released inmates.
According to Mears and his associates, for supermax pris-
ons to be effective they must achieve a number of hard-to-
reach goals: identifying the most disruptive inmates, placing 
enough of them in supermax confi nement, and reducing their 
misbehavior upon return to the general population. Failure to 
meet these requirements, Mears and company believe, under-
mines the overall effectiveness of the supermax concept.99
Legal Rights Placement in a supermax prison can place a 
severe burden on inmates, not the least of which is the lim-
itation placed on all human contact. The Supreme Court, 
in the case of Wilkinson v. Austin, therefore created a three-
pronged test to determine whether such a placement is war-
ranted. Consideration must be given to:
(1) the private interest that will be affected by the of-
fi cial action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation 
of such interest through the procedures used, and the 
probable value, if any, of additional or substitute pro-
cedural safeguards; and (3) the government’s interest, 
including the function involved and the fi scal and ad-
ministrative burdens that additional or substitute proce-
dural requirement would entail.
So before an inmate can be placed in or transferred to a 
supermax facility, the state must show that the actions were 
justified, that the procedures used protected the inmate 
from mistaken transfer, and that no other reasonable option 
was available.100
Private Prisons On January 6, 1986, the U.S. Corrections 
Corporation opened the fi rst privately run state prison in 
Marion, Kentucky—a 300-bed minimum-security facility

CHAPTER 18 | Punishment and Correction  643
inmates who become victims are physically weaker and less 
likely to form cohesive defensive groups.116 In one study, 
criminologist Daniel Lockwood found that inmate aggres-
sors come from a street culture that stresses violence and 
continue to behave violently while in prison.117 Young males 
may be raped and kept as sexual slaves by older, more ag-
gressive inmates. When these “slave holders” are released, 
they often sell their “prison wives” to other inmates (prison 
rape will be discussed later in the chapter).118
To avoid victimization, inmates must learn to adopt a 
lifestyle that shields them from victimization.119 They must 
discover areas of safety and danger, whom to trust and 
whom to avoid. Some learn how to fi ght back to prove they 
are not people who can be exploited. People who viewed 
violence as an acceptable method of settling disputes before 
entering prison are the ones most likely to use violence while 
they are inmates.120 Whereas some kill their attackers and 
get even longer sentences, others join cliques and gangs that 
provide protection and the ability to acquire power within 
the institution. Gangs are powerful in the larger prison sys-
tems, especially in California. Some inmates seek transfers 
to a different cell block or prison, ask for protective custody, 
or simply remain in their cells all the time.
Part of inmates’ early adjustment involves becom-
ing familiar with and perhaps participating in the hidden, 
black market economy of the prison—the hustle. Hustling 
provides inmates with a source of steady income and the 
satisfaction of believing they are beating the system.121 Hus-
tling involves the sale of such illegal commodities as drugs 
(uppers, downers, pot), alcohol, weapons, and illegally ob-
tained food and supplies. When prison offi cials crack down 
on hustled goods, it merely drives the price up—giving 
hustlers a greater incentive to promote their black market 
activities.122
Inmates must also learn to deal with daily racial con-
fl ict. Prisoners tend to segregate themselves and, if peace 
is to reign in the institution, stay out of one another’s way. 
Often racial groupings are quite exact; for example, Latinos 
may separate themselves according to their national origin 
(Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, and so on). In large 
California prisons, segregation and power struggles create 
even narrower divisions. For example, Latino gangs are or-
ganized by area of origin: northern California (Norteños), 
southern California (Sureños), and Mexican-born (Border 
Brothers).123 Prisons represent one area in which minorities 
often hold power; as sociologist James B. Jacobs observed, 
“Prison may be the one institution in American society that 
blacks control.”124
Prisoners must learn to deal with their frustrations over 
getting a “rotten deal.” They may fi nd that some other in-
mates received far lower sentences for similar crimes. They 
may be turned down for parole and then observe that others 
with similar records are granted early release. There is some 
evidence that perceived discrimination in the distribution 
of rewards and treatment may contribute to dissatisfaction, 
maladjustment, and prison violence.125
Living in Prison: Males
Male inmates quickly learn what the term “total institution” 
really means.109 When they arrive at the prison, they are 
stripped, searched, shorn, and assigned living quarters. Be-
fore they get there, though, their fi rst experience occurs in 
a classifi cation or reception center, where they are given a 
series of psychological and other tests and are evaluated on 
the basis of their personality, background, offense history, 
and treatment needs. Based on the classification they are 
given, they will be assigned to a permanent facility. Hard-
core, repeat, and violent offenders will go to the maximum-
security unit; offenders with learning disabilities may be 
assigned to an institution that specializes in educational ser-
vices; mentally disordered offenders will be held in a facility 
that can provide psychiatric care; and so on. Some states 
have instituted rigorous classifi cation instruments designed 
to maximize the effectiveness of placements, thereby cutting 
down on the cost of incarceration. If classifi cation can be 
conducted in an effi cient and effective manner, nondanger-
ous offenders would not needlessly be kept in expensive 
high-security facilities.110
Inmates in large, inaccessible prisons fi nd themselves 
physically cut off from families, friends, and former asso-
ciates. Those who are fathers may become depressed be-
cause they are anxious about their kids.111 Their families 
and friends may fi nd it diffi cult to travel great distances to 
visit them; mail is censored and sometimes destroyed. The 
prison regulates dress, work, sleep, and eating habits.112
Inmates fi nd themselves in a totally new world with its 
own logic, behavior, rules, and language. They must learn to 
live with the stress of prison life. The major losses are goods 
and services, liberty, heterosexual relationships, autonomy, 
and security.113 Prisoners fi nd they have no privacy; even 
when locked in their own cells, they are surrounded and 
observed by others.
Inmates must adjust to the incentives prison adminis-
trators have created to promote security and control behav-
ior.114 One type of incentive involves the level of comfort 
provided the inmate. Those obeying rules are given choice 
work assignments, privileges, and educational opportuni-
ties. Those who fl out prison rules may be segregated, locked 
in their cells, or put in solitary confi nement (the hole).
Administrators can also control the amount of time spent 
in prison. Furloughs can be dispensed to allow prisoners the 
opportunity to work or visit outside prison walls. Good-time 
credit can be extended to lessen sentences. Parole decisions 
can be infl uenced by reports on inmates’ behavior. Inmates 
who maintain their innocence may fi nd that their denial is 
communicated to paroling authorities, thereby putting their 
release date in jeopardy. This is especially vexing for those 
inmates who are actually innocent and who actively refuse 
to accept their institutional label of convicted criminal.115
The inmate must learn to deal with sexual exploitation 
and violence in the prison. One position says that this phe-
nomenon is a function of racial confl ict; another holds that

lessen the pains of prison life, help them adjust, and im-
prove the social climate within female institutions.131
Confi nement for women, however, may produce severe 
anxiety and anger because they are separated from families 
and loved ones and unable to function in normal female 
roles. Low self-esteem is a major problem among female 
inmates.132 Unlike men, who direct their anger outward, 
female prisoners may revert to more self-destructive acts 
to cope with their problems. Female inmates are perhaps 
more likely than males to mutilate their own bodies and at-
tempt suicide. It is not surprising, considering these circum-
stances, that female inmates are more likely to be treated 
with mood-altering drugs and placed in psychiatric care, 
whereas male inmates’ adjustment diffi culties are viewed as 
disciplinary problems.133
One common form of adaptation to prison employed 
by women is the surrogate family. This group contains 
masculine and feminine fi gures acting as fathers and moth-
ers; some even act as children and take on the role of either 
brother or sister. Formalized marriages and divorces may 
be conducted. Sometimes multiple roles are held by one in-
mate, so that a “sister” in one family may “marry” and be-
come the “wife” in another.134
Helping the Female Inmate The special needs of fe-
male inmates must be addressed by correctional authorities. 
Health care is an issue. Many institutions have inadequate 
facilities to care for women who are pregnant when they en-
ter prison or become pregnant during their prison stay.135 
There is a growing problem of HIV-related illnesses as the 
ongoing war on drugs increases the number of substance-
abusing female inmates who are at risk for AIDS.136
Helping women to adjust after they leave the institution 
is another goal. Surveys indicate that the prison experience 
does little to prepare women to reenter the workforce after 
their sentences have been completed. Gender stereotypes 
still shape vocational opportunities.137 Female inmates are 
still being trained for “women’s roles,” such as childrearing, 
and are not given the programming to make successful ad-
justments in the community.138
Female offenders are more likely than males to be con-
victed of a nonviolent crime and incarcerated for a low-level 
involvement in drug offenses, such as driving a boyfriend to 
make a drug deal. The female offender may end up serving 
a longer sentence than the boyfriend simply because she is 
less likely to work out a plea arrangement.139 It is not sur-
prising that many women display psychological problems, 
including serious psychopathology.140 The picture that 
emerges of the female inmate is troubling. After a lifetime of 
emotional turmoil, physical and sexual abuse, and drug use, 
it seems improbable that overcrowded, underfunded correc-
tional institutions can forge a dramatic turnaround in the 
behavior of at-risk female inmates. Many have lost custody 
of their children, a trauma that is more likely to affl ict those 
who are already substance abusers and suffer from depres-
sion.141 While some who receive emotional support can be 
Finally, as the inmates’ sentences wind down and their 
parole dates near, they must learn to cope with the anxiety 
of being released into the outside world. During this period, 
inmates may question their ability to make it in an environ-
ment in which they have failed before. Have their families 
stood by them? Are they outcasts? Facing release, these in-
mates often experience low self-esteem, become depressed, 
and suffer anxiety.126
Of course, not all inmates learn to cope. Some repeat-
edly violate institutional rules. One reason is that in the 
United States and abroad many inmates suffer from serious 
psychological and emotional problems, including major de-
pression and personality disorder.127
Living in Prison: Females
Women make up between 5 and 6 percent of the adult 
prison population. While their numbers are much smaller, 
the percentage of women in prison is increasing at a faster 
pace, a phenomenon that refl ects the increasing presence of 
women in the crime rate. Female inmates are usually housed 
in minimum-security institutions more likely to resemble 
college dormitories than high-security male prisons. Women 
in prison tend to be of three basic types, described by Esther 
Heffernan: “the square,” who is basically a noncriminal but 
who, in a fi t of rage, may have shot or stabbed a husband 
or boyfriend; “the life,” who is a repeat offender (shoplifter, 
prostitute, drug user, or pusher); and “the cool,” who is part 
of the sophisticated criminal underworld. The square usu-
ally espouses conventional values and wants to follow the 
rules; the life rejects prison authority and is a rebel; the cool 
is aloof, manipulates the environment, and does not partici-
pate in prison life.128
Like men, female inmates must adjust to the prison ex-
perience. Female inmates generally fi rst go through a period 
in which they deny the reality of their situation. Then comes 
a period of anger over the circumstances that led to their in-
carceration; during this phase, they begin to accept the cir-
cumstances of their imprisonment. A third stage fi nds female 
inmates greatly depressed because they can no longer deny 
that they are in prison to stay. Many female inmates eventu-
ally fi nd reason to hope that their lives will improve.129
Daily life in the women’s prison community is also 
somewhat different from that in male institutions. For one 
thing, women usually do not present the immediate physi-
cal danger to staff and fellow inmates that many male pris-
oners do. For another, the rigid, antiauthority inmate social 
code found in many male institutions does not exist in fe-
male prisons. Research conducted in the California prison 
system found that few female inmates experience the violent 
atmosphere common in male institutions, nor do they suf-
fer the racial and ethnic confl ict and divisiveness.130 Female 
inmates seem to receive more social support from both in-
ternal sources (inmate peers and correctional staff) and ex-
ternal sources (families and peers), a factor that may help

EXHIBIT 18.5 
Correctional Treatment Program Types
Therapy and Counseling
The most traditional type of treatment in prison involves 
psychological counseling and therapy. Counseling programs 
exist in almost every major institution. Some stress individual 
treatment with psychotherapy or other techniques. However, 
because of lack of resources, it is more common for group 
methods to be used. Some groups are led by trained social 
workers, counselors, or therapists; others rely on lay personnel 
as leaders.
Therapeutic Communities
Because drug abuse is so prevalent among inmates, some 
institutions have been organized into therapeutic communities 
(TCs) in order to best serve their clientele. The TC approach to 
substance abuse uses a psychosocial, experiential learning 
process that relies on positive peer pressure within a highly 
structured social environment. The community itself, including 
staff and program participants, becomes the primary method of 
change. They work together as members of a “family” in order 
to create a culture where community members confront one 
another’s negative behavior and attitudes and establish an 
open, trusting, and safe environment; TC relies then on mutual 
self-help. The TC approach encourages personal disclosure 
rather than the isolation of the general prison culture.
Educational Programs
Almost all correctional institutions provide some type of 
educational experience. Some prisons allow inmates to obtain 
a high school diploma through equivalency exams or general 
educational development (GED) certificates. Some prisons 
provide college courses, usually staffed by teachers who work 
at nearby institutions. These services are extremely important 
because about two-thirds of all state prison inmates did not 
receive a high school diploma. Recent federal surveys indicate 
that about one-quarter of state prison inmates were able to 
complete the GED while serving time in a correctional facility; 
more than half take education courses while confined.
Vocational Programs
Most prisons operate numerous vocational training programs 
designed to help inmates develop skills for securing employment 
on their release. In the past, the traditional prison industries of 
laundry and license plate manufacture failed to provide these 
skills. Today programs stress such marketable skills as dental 
laboratory work, computer programming, auto repair, and radio 
and television work.
Private Industry
A new version of vocational rehabilitation is the development 
of private industry in prison. This can take many different 
forms, including private citizens sitting on prison industry boards, 
private vendors marketing goods from prison industry, inmates 
manufacturing and marketing their own goods, private 
management of state-owned prison industry, franchising within 
the prison system in which manufactured goods are marketed 
under license from a private firm, and privately owned industries 
on prison grounds employing inmate labor.
Self-Help Groups
Recognizing that the probability of failure on the outside is acute, 
inmates have attempted to organize self-help groups to provide 
the psychological tools needed to prevent recidivism. Some are 
chapters of common national organizations such as Alcoholics 
Anonymous. Membership in these programs is designed to 
improve inmates’ self-esteem and help them cope with common 
problems such as alcoholism, narcotics abuse, or depression.
helped to adjust and reenter society, it should come as no 
surprise that many female inmates feel strain and confl ict, 
psychological conditions related to violent episodes.142
Correctional Treatment
Correctional treatment has been an integral part of prison 
life since warden Z. R. Brockway introduced it as part of the 
daily regimen at the Elmira Reformatory in the nineteenth 
century. Today more than 90 percent of all prison inmates 
participate in some form of program or activity after admis-
sion. One recent survey of correctional treatment found that 
substance abuse education and awareness is the most com-
mon form of treatment.143
There are many approaches to treatment. Some, based 
on a medical model, rely heavily on counseling and clinical 
therapy. Others attempt to prepare inmates for reintegration 
into the community; they rely on work release, vocational 
training, and educational opportunities. Still others stress 
self-help through 12-step or Alcoholics Anonymous pro-
grams. Some programs have a religious theme and involve 
Bible clubs and other pious activities.144 Under the George 
W. Bush administration, faith-based rehabilitation efforts 
fl ourished, and some were shown to be positive infl uences 
on inmate behavior.145
Although it is beyond the scope of this book to describe 
the vast number of correctional treatment programs, a few 
important types are listed in Exhibit 18.5.
Faith-Based Programs Research has shown that inmates 
involved in religious programs and education do better fol-
lowing release than those in comparison groups, but differ-
ences quickly erode.146 Nonetheless, under the George W. 
Bush administration, religion-oriented faith-based rehabili-
tation efforts fl ourished.147 In 2003, then-Governor Jeb Bush 
dedicated the fi rst faith-based prison in the United States, 
a 750-bed medium-security facility for males in Lawtey,

institutions.157 Among the characteristics associated with 
the most successful programs are these:
Services are intensive, lasting only a few months.
 
■
Programs are cognitive, aimed at helping inmates learn 
 
■
new skills in order to better cope with personality prob-
lems such as impulsivity.
Program goals are reinforced fi rmly and fairly, using 
 
■
positive rewards rather than negative punishment.
Therapists relate to clients sensitively and positively. 
 
■
Therapists are trained and supervised appropriately.
Clients are insulated from disruptive interpersonal 
 
■
networks and placed in environments where prosocial 
activities predominate.158
So although the concept of correctional treatment is of-
ten questioned, many criminologists still believe that it is 
possible to help some inmates within prison walls.
Prison Violence
On August 9, 1973, Stephen Donaldson, a Quaker peace 
activist, was arrested for trespassing after participating in a 
pray-in at the White House. Sent to a Washington, D.C., jail 
for two nights, Donaldson was gang raped approximately 
60 times by numerous inmates. Donaldson later became 
president of Stop Prisoner Rape, a nonprofi t organization 
that advocates for the protection of inmates from sexual as-
sault and offers support to victims. On July 18, 1996, at the 
age of 49, Donaldson passed away from infections compli-
cated by AIDS.159
Confl ict, violence, and brutality are sad but ever-present 
facts of institutional life. Violence can involve individual 
confl ict: inmate versus inmate, inmate versus staff, staff ver-
sus inmate.
What are the causes of prison violence? There is no sin-
gle explanation for either collective or individual violence, 
but theories abound. One position holds that inmates are 
often violence-prone individuals who have always used 
force to get their own way. In the crowded, dehumanizing 
world of the prison, it is not surprising that they resort to 
force to dominate others.160
A second view is that prisons convert people to vio-
lence by their inhumane conditions, including overcrowd-
ing, depersonalization, and threats of rape. Even in the most 
humane prisons, life is a constant put-down, and prison 
conditions threaten the inmates’ sense of self-worth; vio-
lence is a consequence of these conditions.161
Still another view is that prison violence stems from 
mismanagement, lack of strong security, and inadequate 
control by prison offi cials.162 This view has contributed to 
the escalated use of solitary confi nement in recent years as 
a means of control. Also contributing to prison violence 
is the changing prison population. Younger, more violent 
inmates, who often have been members of teenage gangs, 
now dominate prison life. The old code of “do your own 
Florida. Governor Bush claimed that the only way to achieve 
the rehabilitation of criminals and to reduce recidivism is to 
“lead them to God.”148 In 2004, Florida converted what was 
then the all-male Hillsborough Correctional Institution to 
the nation’s fi rst faith-based correctional facility for women. 
Other states, including Texas, Kansas, Minnesota, Florida, 
and Iowa, have opened new prison facilities in which the 
central philosophy involves religious teaching. Privately run 
Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) has faith-based 
programs at all its facilities.149
Can faith-based programs work or are they a fad fated 
to fade away with change in the political winds? Evaluation 
of both Lawtey and Hillsborough, the two Florida faith- and 
character-based correctional institutions, conducted by the 
Urban Institute found that staff, inmates, and volunteers 
overwhelmingly fi nd value in the model and believe that 
it is achieving its goals of changing inmate behaviors, pre-
paring inmates for successful reentry, and ultimately reduc-
ing recidivism. The researchers concluded that faith-based 
programs promote family reunification and employment 
prospects upon release, while also improving the prison 
environment for inmates, volunteers, and staff.150 Despite 
these favorable reviews, there were concerns with security 
and safety within the facility. Considering the high levels of 
inmate–civilian interaction, volunteers may be vulnerable to 
manipulation and undermine correctional offi cers’ efforts to 
maintain a safe and secure environment.
Does Correctional Treatment Work? Despite the variety 
and number of treatment programs in operation, there have 
been serious questions raised about their effectiveness.151
Less-than-enthusiastic reviews of correctional rehabilitation 
have helped develop a more conservative view of correc-
tions, which means that prisons are viewed as places of in-
capacitation and confi nement; their purpose is punishment, 
not treatment.152 Current social policy stresses eliminating 
the nonserious offender from the correctional system while 
increasing the sentences of serious, violent offenders. The de-
velopment of lengthy mandatory and determinate sentences 
to punish serious offenders and the simultaneous evolution 
of alternative sanctions to limit the nonserious offender’s in-
terface with the system are manifestations of this view.
Some criminologists continue to challenge the prevail-
ing “nothing works” philosophy.153 Analysis of education, 
vocation, and work programs indicates that they may be 
able to lower recidivism rates and increase postrelease em-
ployment.154 Inmates who have completed higher levels of 
education fi nd it easier to gain employment upon release 
and consequently are less likely to recidivate over long 
periods.155
In general, treatment seems to be most effective if it is 
matched with the needs of inmates.156 Programs that teach 
interpersonal skills, utilize individual counseling, and make 
use of behavioral modifi cation techniques to improve cogni-
tive reasoning and develop social skills have produced posi-
tive results both in the community and within correctional

half of all inmates experience some form of 
sexual coercion. Why the difficulty in getting 
an accurate count? Inmates are reluctant to 
report rape to both researchers and prison 
administrators. The inmate social code de-
mands that inmates be strong and show no 
sign of weakness. Although the assailant in 
a sexual assault gains respect and status, 
the victim may fear that his fellow inmates 
may perceive him as weak and vulnerable 
to further attacks. Inmates fear that if they 
report sexual assault they will be harassed 
or face retaliation by other inmates.
Surveys show that prison administrators 
deny or downplay the occurrence of rape. 
However, self-report surveys of the inmates 
themselves found evidence that at least 
60,000 attacks occur each year. Expressed 
as a rate, that amounts to an estimated 123 
incidents of sexual victimization per 1,000 
inmates held in state and federal prisons, 
or about 12 percent of all inmates.
What Factors Lead to Sexual 
Victimization?
Studies show that institutions with the high-
est sexual coercion rates had commonali-
ties, including barrack-style housing, large 
prison populations, and lenient security. In 
these institutions, sexual harassment leads 
to fights, social isolation, fear, anxiety, and 
crisis. Victims tend to be white, young, and 
intellectually impaired.
Sexual Violence in Women’s Prisons
There are numerous reports of female pris-
oners being sexually abused and exploited 
by male correctional workers who use ei-
ther brute force or psychological coercion 
to gain sexual control over inmates. Staff-
on-inmate sexual misconduct covers a wide 
range of behaviors, from lewd remarks 
to voyeurism to assault and rape. Few if 
any of these incidents are reported, and 
perpetrators rarely go to trial. Institutional 
workers cover for each other, and women 
who file complaints are offered little pro-
tection from vengeful guards. Because the 
situation persists, more than 40 states and 
the District of Columbia have been forced to 
pass laws criminalizing some types of staff 
sexual misconduct in prisons.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. Considering the threat of prison rape 
and sexual coercion, would you allow 
male guards to work in a female prison? 
If you say no, what about male teach-
ers, doctors, psychologists, wardens?
 2. Can you make an argument for segre-
gating inmates on the basis of race and 
age—that is, to have prisons for young 
white males, young black males, older 
white males, and so on?

Sexual Violence in Prison
One of the most common visions of prison 
life is the routine threat of sexual coercion 
and violence. The problem appears so 
severe that Congress enacted the Prison 
Rape Reduction Act of 2003, which estab-
lished three programs in the Department of 
Justice:
A program dedicated to collecting na-
 
■
tional prison rape statistics, data, and 
conducting research
A program dedicated to the dissemina-
 
■
tion of information and procedures for 
combating prison rape
A program to assist in funding state 
 
■
programs
Who are the targets of prison sexual vio-
lence? Young males may be raped and kept 
as sexual slaves by older, more aggressive 
inmates. When these “slave holders” are 
released, they often sell their “prison wives” 
to other inmates. Some inmates will request 
that regular sexual payments be made to 
them in exchange for protection from even 
more violent inmates who threaten rape 
and beatings. These weaker inmates are 
called “punk” and put at the bottom of the 
inmate sexual hierarchy. Straight inmates 
are more likely to respect “true” homosexu-
als because they were gay before entering 
prison and are therefore “true to them-
selves,” while punks are despised because 
they are weak: they did not want to have 
sex with other men, but were too weak to 
resist or not brave enough to stand up to 
sexual predators. Even “queens,” inmates 
who look and act like women, get more re-
spect than punks because they chose their 
lifestyle and did not have it forced upon 
them by others.
How Common Is Prison Rape?

very rare, whereas others find that nearly

Sexual violence is another problem in prison; this is the

Corrections and the Rule of Law
For many years, the nation’s courts did not interfere in 
prison operations, maintaining what is called the hands-
off doctrine (see Chapter 16). The judiciary’s reluctance to

Cruel and Unusual Punishment
Prisoners have long suffered severe physical punishment in 
prison, ranging from whipping to extended periods of soli-
tary confi nement. The courts have held that such treatment 
is unconstitutional when it:

■
given171

■

In a 2002 case, Hope v. Pelzer, the Supreme Court ruled 
that correctional offi cials who knowingly violate the right 
of inmates to be free from cruel and unusual punishments 
can be held liable for damages.173 Hope, an Alabama prison 
inmate, was painfully handcuffed to a hitching post for 
disruptive conduct. The Supreme Court ruled that Hope’s 
treatment amounted to “unnecessary and wanton” infl iction 
of pain, constituting cruel and unusual punishment forbid-
den by the Eighth Amendment. The Hope case shows that 
correctional offi cials can be sued if their behavior violates 
an inmate’s constitutional rights and that offi cials or any rea-
sonable person should have surmised that the behavior was 
in violation of accepted practices.
Racial Segregation
On August 8, 2009, a riot in the California prison at Chino 
left hundreds injured, buildings burned, and property de-
stroyed.174 The disturbance was sparked by racial tensions 
between Latino and black inmates, and later sparked a great 
deal of controversy over the issue of racial segregation in 
prison: should prisons be segregated to prevent violence 
among gangs like the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mexican 
Mafia, and the Black Guerrilla Family? Or as with other 
institutions, are inmates entitled to equal treatment under 
the law and any form of segregation considered inherently 
unconstitutional?
In a 2005 case, Johnson v. California, the Supreme Court 
ruled that the segregation of prison inmates based on race, 
in their cells or anywhere on prison grounds, is an inap-
propriate form of racial classifi cation.175 However, it left it 
open for lower courts to decide, using a standard of strict 
scrutiny, when segregation is inappropriate and unconstitu-
tional. Johnson focused on the policy of segregating inmates 
upon their arrival at a prison. However, the Court’s ruling 
seemed to suggest that if racial segregation was allowed for 
incoming inmates, there is a danger that it might also be 
used “in the dining halls, yards, and general housing areas.” 
Segregation should only be allowed, the judges reasoned, if 
a prison administrator could prove that it served a compel-
ling interest to promote prison safety. The Court recognized 
that “prisons are dangerous places, and the special circum-
stances they present may justify racial classifi cations in some 
interfere in prison matters was based on the belief that it 
lacked technical competence in prison administration, soci-
ety’s general apathy toward prisons, and the belief that pris-
oners’ complaints involved privileges rather than rights.163 
The hands-off doctrine was lifted in the 1960s. General 
concern with civil and human rights, increasing militancy in 
the prison population, and the reformist nature of the War-
ren Court created a climate conducive to change.
For many years, the Supreme Court upheld inmates’ 
rights, granting them access to the courts to seek legal re-
dress for improper or damaging prison conditions. Re-
cently, claims that prisoner-inspired lawsuits were clogging 
the courts swayed a more conservative Court to limit the 
methods by which inmates can seek release or redress, for 
example, by discouraging inmates from filing “frivolous” 
lawsuits.164 Then in 1996 Congress enacted the Prison Liti-
gation Reform Act (PLRA), which makes it harder for pris-
oners to fi le lawsuits in federal court. The PLRA mandates 
that before an inmate can fi le a lawsuit, the inmate must try 
to resolve the complaint through the prison’s grievance pro-
cedure, which usually requires fi ling a written description of 
the complaint or grievance with a prison offi cial.165
Nonetheless, some of the gains won by inmates continue 
in force, including the following.
Freedom of Speech and Press The courts have ruled 
that inmates retain freedom of speech and press unless 
correctional authorities can show that it interferes with or 
threatens institutional freedom. In Procunier v. Martinez, a 
court ruled that an inmate’s mail could be censored only 
if there existed substantial belief that its contents would 
threaten security. However, in Saxbe v. Washington Post, the 
right of an inmate to grant press interviews was limited; the 
Supreme Court argued that such interviews would enhance 
the reputations of particular inmates and jeopardize author-
ities’ desire to treat everyone equally.166
Medical Rights After many years of indifference, inmates 
were given the right to secure proper medical attention. To 
gain their medical rights, prisoners have generally resorted 
to class action suits to ask courts to require adequate medi-
cal care.167 In 1976, after reviewing the legal principles es-
tablished over the preceding 20 years, the Supreme Court in 
Estelle v. Gamble clearly stated the inmate’s right to medical 
care. The court said:168
Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of pris-
oners constitutes the “unnecessary and wanton infl ic-
tion of pain,” . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment. 
This is true whether the indifference is manifested by 
prison doctors in their response to the prisoner’s needs 
or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying 
access to medical care or intentionally interfering with 
the treatment once prescribed.169
Lower courts will decide, case by case, whether “deliberate 
indifference” has actually occurred.

CHAPTER 18 | Punishment and Correction  649
The Parolee in the Community
Once community release has begun, the offender is super-
vised by a trained staff of parole offi cers who help the of-
fender adjust to the community and search for employment 
as they monitor behavior and activities to ensure that the 
offender conforms to the conditions of parole.
Parolees are subject to strict standardized or personal-
ized rules that guide their behavior and limit their activities. 
If at any time these rules are violated, the offender can be 
returned to the institution to serve the remainder of the sen-
tence; this is known as a technical parole violation. Inmates 
released in determinate sentencing states can have part or all 
of their good time revoked if they violate the conditions of 
their release.
In some jurisdictions, parolees in need of closer surveil-
lance are placed on intensive supervision parole (ISP). 
These programs use limited caseload sizes, treatment facili-
ties, the matching of parolee and supervisor by personality, 
and shock parole (which involves immediate short-term 
incarceration for parole violators to impress them with the 
seriousness of a violation). ISP clients are required to at-
tend more offi ce and home visits than routine parolees. ISP 
may also require frequent drug testing, a term in a com-
munity correctional center, and electronic monitoring in 
the home. More than 17,000 parolees are under intensive 
supervision, 1,400 of whom are monitored electronically 
by computer.
How Effective Is Parole?
Conservative thinkers criticize parole because it allows pos-
sibly dangerous offenders into the community before the 
completion of their sentences. Parole decision making re-
lies on human judgment, so it is quite possible that dan-
gerous offenders, who should actually have remained inside 
a secure facility, are released into society while others who 
would probably make a good adjustment to the community 
are denied release.
The evaluation of parole effectiveness has produced 
some disturbing results. Despite all efforts to treat, correct, 
and rehabilitate incarcerated offenders, the fact remains that 
a majority return to prison shortly after their release. Fed-
eral surveys indicate that about two-thirds of all released 
inmates are rearrested within three years of leaving prison 
for a felony or serious misdemeanor.179 About half are re-
convicted for a new crime. Within three years, about half 
were back in prison, serving time for a new prison sentence 
or for a technical violation of their release, such as failing a 
drug test, missing an appointment with their parole offi cer, 
or being arrested for a new crime.
What factors predict parole failure? Prisons may do 
little to help inmates adjust on the outside. As correc-
tional expert Stephen Duguid maintains, by their very 
nature, prisons seek to impose and maintain order and 
contexts.” Because the Chino riot occurred after California 
began to integrate prison entry centers, it is possible that 
future efforts to racially integrate prisons will be frustrated. 
It is possible that state courts, even when using a “strict 
scrutiny” standard, may conclude that racial integration, in 
some instances, is just too dangerous.
PAROLE
Parole is the planned release and community supervision 
of incarcerated offenders before the expiration of their 
prison sentences. It is usually considered a way of com-
pleting a prison sentence in the community and is not the 
same as a pardon; the paroled offender can be legally re-
called to serve the remainder of his or her sentence in an 
institution if parole authorities deem the offender’s adjust-
ment inadequate or if the offender commits another crime 
while on parole.
The decision to parole is determined by statutory re-
quirement and usually involves the completion of a mini-
mum sentence. Parole is granted by a state (or federal) 
parole board: a body of men and women who review cases 
and determine whether an offender has been rehabilitated 
suffi ciently to deal with the outside world. The board also 
dictates the specifi c parole rules a parolee must obey.
Some states with determinate sentencing statutes do not 
use parole boards but release inmates at the conclusion of 
their maximum terms, less accumulated good time. This 
form of mandatory parole release has been increasing rap-
idly as states adopt various forms of determinate sentenc-
ing. State inmates released from prison as a result of a parole 
board decision dropped from 50 percent of all adults enter-
ing parole in 1995 to about 30 percent today.176
In states where discretionary parole is used, the de-
cision is made at a parole grant hearing. There the full 
board or a subcommittee reviews information, may meet 
with the offender, and then decides whether the parole 
applicant has a reasonable chance of succeeding outside 
prison. Candidates for parole may be chosen by statu-
tory eligibility on the basis of time served in relation to 
their sentences. In most jurisdictions, good time reduces 
the minimum sentence and therefore hastens eligibility for 
parole. In making its decision, the board considers the in-
mate’s offense, time served, evidence of adjustment, and 
opportunities on the outside.
To help these parole decision makers, parole predic-
tion tables have been developed.177 These tables correlate 
personal information on inmates who were released in the 
past with their rates of rearrest. The best-known predictive 
device is the Salient Factor Score Index. The salient factor 
score includes age, type of offense, prior parole revocations, 
history of heroin use, and employment background.178

shelters. One study of shelters in New York 
City found that 23 percent of the occupants 
had been released from New York prisons 
and jails in the past two years.
The increased reentry risks can be tied 
to legal changes in how people are re-
leased from prison. In the past, offenders 
were granted early release only if a parole 
board believed they were rehabilitated 
and had ties to the community—such as 
a family or a job. Inmates were encour-
aged to enter treatment programs to earn 
parole. Changes in sentencing laws have 
resulted in the growth of mandatory re-
lease and limits on discretionary parole. 
People now serve a fixed sentence, and 
the discretion of parole boards has been 
blunted. Inmates may be discouraged 
from seeking involvement in rehabilita-
tion programs (they do not influence the 
chance of parole), and the lack of incen-
tive means that fewer inmates leaving 
prison have participated in programs to 
address work, education, and substance 
use deficiencies. Nor does the situation 
improve upon release. Many inmates 
are not assigned to supervision case-
loads once back in the community. About 
200,000 released inmates go unsuper-
vised each year, three-quarters of whom 
have been released after completing their 
maximum sentence and are therefore not 
obligated to be supervised.
Petersilia argues that most leave 
prison with no savings, no immediate 
entitlement to unemployment benefits, 
and few employment prospects. Upon re-
lease, some find that they are no longer 
welcome in subsidized public housing 
complexes due to the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development’s “one 
strike and you’re out” policy, where all 
members of the household are evicted if 
one member is involved in crime. A year 
after release, as many as 60 percent of 
former inmates are not employed in the 
regular labor market, and employers are 
increasingly reluctant to hire ex-offend-
ers. Ex-offenders are commonly barred 
from working in the fields in which most 
jobs are being created, such as child 
care, education, security, nursing, and 
home health care. More jobs are also 
now unionized, and many unions exclude 
ex-offenders.
Being barred from work opportuni-
ties produces chronic unemployment, a 
status closely related to drug and alco-
hol abuse. Losing a job can lead to sub-
stance abuse, which in turn is related 
to child and family violence. Children of 
incarcerated and released parents may 
suffer confusion, sadness, and social 
stigma, and these feelings often result in 
difficulties in school, low self-esteem, ag-
gressive behavior, and general emotional 
The Problems of Reentry
The specter of recidivism is especially frus-
trating to the U.S. public. It is so difficult 
to apprehend and successfully prosecute 
criminal offenders that it seems foolish to 
grant them early release so they can prey 
on more victims. This problem is exacer-
bated when the parolee is a chronic, fre-
quent offender. Research indicates that 
many of these returning prisoners are less 
prepared for reintegration and less con-
nected to community-based social struc-
tures than in the past. There seems to be a 
strong association between prior and future 
offending: the parolees most likely to fail on 
release are the ones who have failed in the 
past; chronic offenders are the ones most 
likely to reoffend.
The problems of reentry are exacer-
bated now because of America’s two-de-
cade-long imprisonment boom, which has 
resulted in more than 700,000 inmates be-
ing released back into the community each 
year. As criminologist Joan Petersilia warns, 
there are a number of unfortunate conse-
quences to this because many of those be-
ing released have not received adequate 
treatment and are unprepared for life in 
conventional society. The risks they pres-
ent to the community include increases in 
child abuse, family violence, the spread 
of infectious diseases, homelessness, and 
community disorganization. Many have 
no way to cope and wind up in homeless

conformity rather than to help inmates develop skills 
such as independence and critical thinking, factors that 
may be essential once the inmate is forced to cope outside 
the prison’s walls.180
Inmates themselves may have a long history of crim-
inal behavior, an antisocial personality, a record of sub-
stance abuse, and childhood experiences with family 
dysfunction—factors that are correlated with postrelease 
recidivism.181 Many releasees have suffered from a life-
time of substance abuse or dependence disorder. A his-
tory of physical and sexual abuse has also been linked to 
recidivism.182 More than 10 percent exhibit both men-
tal illness and substance abuse. Parolees who have had 
a good employment record in the past and who main-
tain jobs after their release are the most likely to avoid 
recidivating.183
The Criminological Enterprise feature “The Problems of 
Reentry” discusses the problems of parole failure.
In sum, many parolees are returned to prison for tech-
nical violations. It is therefore likely that one of the reasons 
for prison overcrowding is the large number of technical 
parole violators who are returned within three years of 
their release. If overcrowding is to be successfully dealt 
with, a more realistic parole violation policy may have to 
be developed in areas where the correctional system is un-
der stress.

dependent, live in disorganized areas, 
and lack close personal relationships are 
the ones most likely to fail on parole. Hav-
ing a history of drug abuse is particularly 
harmful. According to recent research 
conducted by Beth Heubner and her as-
sociates, substance abuse makes it very 
difficult to readjust. It compromises re-
turning women’s employment opportuni-
ties, relationships with their children, and 
social support. The impact of drug abuse 
is felt most acutely by minority women 
who must balance the demands of sub-
stance abuse treatment, employment, 
and family responsibilities, all the while 
living in disorganized areas with little ac-
cess to services or social support. Drug 
convictions may close doors to both so-
cial service providers and employers who 
have little interest in helping or employ-
ing abusers. For example, recent welfare 
reform acts deny government benefits to 
people convicted of drug offenses or their 
families, a policy that has a significant im-
pact on African American and Hispanic 
mothers, who are disproportionately rep-
resented in the welfare system. And while 
being a mother seems to be a deterrent to 
recidivism, women in prison who are sub-
stance abusers and marginally employed 
may face loss of parental rights upon re-
lease, further undermining their chances 
of successful reintegration.
CRITICAL THINKING
 1. All too often, government leaders jump 
on the incarceration bandwagon as a 
panacea for the nation’s crime problem. 
Is it a “quick fix” whose long-term con-
sequences may be devastating for the 
nation’s cities, or are these problems 
counterbalanced by the crime-reducing 
effect of putting large numbers of high-
rate offenders behind bars?
 2. If you agree that incarceration under-
mines neighborhoods, can you think of 
some other, indirect ways that high incar-
ceration rates help increase crime rates?

dysfunction. If the parents are negative 
role models, children fail to develop posi-
tive attitudes about work and responsi-
bility. Children of incarcerated parents 
are five times more likely to serve time in 
prison than are children whose parents 
are not incarcerated.
Prisoners have significantly more 
physical and mental health problems than 
the general population. More than three-
fourths of the inmates leaving prison 
report a history of drug and/or alcohol 
abuse in the next year. Even when pub-
lic mental health services are available, 
many mentally ill individuals fail to use 
them because they fear institutionaliza-
tion, deny they are mentally ill, or distrust 
the mental health system. The situation 
will become more serious as more and 
more parolees are released back into the 
disorganized communities whose deterio-
rated conditions may have motivated their 
original crimes.

SUMMARY
 1. Distinguish among the various 
goals of sentencing
According to the concept of 
 
■
general deterrence, people will 
be too afraid to break the law 
if they believe that they will be 
caught and punished severely. 
Specifi c deterrence is aimed 
at convincing offenders that 
the pains of punishment are 
greater than the potential ben-
efi ts of crime. Incapacitation 
is intended to keep criminals 
from repeating their criminal 
acts while they are under state 
control. Retribution is aimed at 
punishing offenders in a man-
ner that is proportionate to the 
gravity of their crimes. Rehabili-
tation rests on the view that the 
justice system is obligated to 
help criminals change. Desert-
based sentencing should be no 
more or less than the offender’s 
actions deserve. Restoration 
calls for defendants to confront 
their behavior, the damage 
they caused the victim, and the

652  PART FOUR | THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
 2. Classify the various types of 
sentencing structures
Indeterminate sentences involve 
 
■
a “light” minimum sentence 
that must be served and a 
lengthy maximum sentence that 
is the outer boundary of the 
time that can be served. Deter-
minate sentences offer a fi xed 
term of years, the maximum set 
in law by the legislature. Man-
datory sentences prohibit peo-
ple convicted of certain offenses 
from being placed on proba-
tion. Three strikes (and you’re 
out) laws provide lengthy terms 
for any person convicted of 
three felony offenses, even if the 
third crime is relatively trivial.
 3. Demonstrate your knowledge of 
the nature of capital punish-
ment in the United States
The most severe sentence used 
 
■
in the United States is capital 
punishment, or execution. 
Despite its continued use and 
public acceptance, there seems 
to be growing unease with the 
administration of the death 
penalty, and the recent use of 
scientifi c evidence based on 
DNA has resulted in numer-
ous exonerations of death row 
inmates.
 4. Be familiar with the arguments 
for and against capital 
punishment
Supporters argue that death is 
 
■
the “ultimate incapacitation”; 
executions serve as a strong de-
terrent for serious crimes; the 
death penalty conforms to the 
requirement that the punish-
ment must be proportional to 
the seriousness of the crime, 
and represents the will of the 
people; and it is almost impos-
sible for an innocent person to 
be executed or for the death 
penalty to be used in a racist or 
capricious manner. Critics of 
the death penalty believe capi-
tal punishment has no place in 
a mature democratic society, 
because of the chances of error, 
the tremendous discretion used 
in seeking the death penalty, 
and the arbitrary manner in 
which it is imposed. They fur-
ther argue that executions are 
unnecessarily cruel and inhu-
mane and come at a high moral 
and social cost.
 5. Be familiar with the concept of 
community sentencing
There are now a great variety of 
 
■
community sentences, ranging 
from traditional probation to 
house arrest and placement in 
community correctional cen-
ters. Community sentences can 
be structured to maximize secu-
rity and maintain public safety.
 6. Know the basics of a probation 
sentence
Most probation orders involve 
 
■
a contract between the court 
and the offender in which 
a prison or jail term is sus-
pended and the probationer 
promises to obey a set of 
probation rules or conditions 
mandated by the court. Of-
fenders who are on proba-
tion have been convicted of 
a crime, but instead of being 
incarcerated, they are returned 
to the community for a period 
in which they must abide by 
certain conditions set forth by 
the court under the supervi-
sion of a probation offi cer. 
When granting probation, the 
court sets down certain condi-
tions or rules of behavior that 
the probationer is bound to 
obey. Probation may be re-
voked if clients fail to comply 
with rules and disobey reason-
able requests to meet their 
treatment obligations.
 7. Know what is meant by inter-
mediate sanctions
Intermediate sanctions include 
 
■
programs that are usually 
administered by probation 
departments: intensive proba-
tion supervision, house arrest, 
electronic monitoring, restitu-
tion orders, shock probation 
or split sentences, and residen-
tial community corrections. 
Intermediate sanctions offer 
effective alternatives to pris-
ons and jails. They also have 
the potential to save money; 
although they are more expen-
sive than traditional probation, 
they are far less costly than 
incarceration.
 8. List the purpose of jails and 
know about jail populations
Jails are used to detain accused 
 
■
offenders who cannot make or 
are not eligible for bail prior to 
trial; they hold convicted of-
fenders awaiting sentence; they 
serve as the principal institu-
tion of secure confi nement for 
offenders convicted of misde-
meanors. Almost 9 out of every 
10 jail inmates are adult males, 
but the number of adult females 
in jail has been increasing faster 
than males.
 9. Know what is meant by prison-
ers’ rights and discuss some key 
privileges that have been 
granted to inmates
Before the early 1960s, it was 
 
■
accepted that on conviction 
an individual forfeited all legal 
rights. As the 1960s drew to 
a close, inmates began to be 
granted legal rights. Today in-
mates have the right to medical 
care, freedom from cruel and 
unusual treatment, the right 
to an attorney, and the right to 
practice their religion.
10. Be knowledgeable about the 
problems of prisoner reentry
Because of America’s two-de-
 
■
cade-long imprisonment boom, 
more than 700,000 inmates are 
now being released back into 
the community each year. Pa-
role failure has been linked to 
being barred from work oppor-
tunities. Ex-inmates may also 
fi nd that going straight is an 
economic impossibility. Many 
employers are reluctant to hire 
people who have served time. 
In general, states have placed 
greater restrictions on former 
felons as part of the “get tough” 
movement.

 1. Do you approve of mandatory 
sentencing laws? Should every 
convicted felon be given the op-
tion of community treatment?
 2. What rights should a probationer 
have before his community sen-
tence is revoked? Is probation a 
privilege or a right? And if a privi-
lege, would you recommend that 
it be revoked for the slightest rule 
violation?
 3. Should a convicted criminal make 
restitution to a wealthy victim 
who does not really need the 
money? When is restitution 
inappropriate?
 4. Should offenders be fi ned based 
on the severity of what they did 
or according to their ability to 
pay? Is it fair to gear fi nes to 
wages? Should some offenders 
be punished more severely be-
cause they are fi nancially 
successful?
 5. Do house arrest and electronic 
monitoring involve a violation of 
personal freedom? Does wearing 
an ankle bracelet smack of Big 
Brother? Would you want the 
government monitoring your 
daily activities? Could this prac-
tice be expanded, for example, 
to monitor the whereabouts of 
AIDS patients or political 
protestors?
 6. Should private companies be al-
lowed to run correctional institu-
tions? What are the drawbacks to 
having a private company take on 
a sensitive and sometimes danger-
ous function such as administer-
ing prisons and jails?

658  
authority confl ict pathway The path to a criminal 
career that begins with early stubborn behavior and 
defi ance of parents.
automatic teller machine (ATM) An automated 
device that gives banking customers access to their 
accounts without the need for human intervention.
avertable recidivist A person whose crime would 
have been prevented if he or she had not been given 
discretionary release and instead been kept behind 
bars.
bail The monetary amount for or condition of pre-
trial release, normally set by a judge at the initial ap-
pearance. The purpose of bail is to ensure the return 
of the accused at subsequent proceedings. If the 
accused is unable to make bail, he or she is detained 
in jail. The Eighth Amendment provides that exces-
sive bail shall not be required.
bail bonding agent A person whose business is 
providing bail to needy offenders, usually at an ex-
orbitant rate of interest.
behavior modeling Process of learning behavior 
(notably aggression) by observing others. Aggressive 
models may be parents, criminals in the neighbor-
hood, or characters on television or in video games 
and movies.
behaviorism The branch of psychology concerned 
with the study of observable behavior rather than 
unconscious motives. It focuses on the relationship 
between particular stimuli and people’s responses 
to them.
Bill of Rights The fi rst ten amendments to the U.S. 
Constitution.
binge drinking Having fi ve or more drinks on the 
same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a 
couple of hours of each other) on at least one day in 
the past 30 days.
biological determinism A belief that criminogenic 
traits can be acquired through indirect heredity 
from a degenerate family whose members suffered 
from such ills as insanity, syphilis, and alcoholism, 
or through direct heredity—being related to a family 
of criminals.
biophobia Sociologists who held the view that no 
serious consideration should be given to biological 
factors when attempting to understand human nature.
biosocial theory An approach to criminology that 
focuses on the interaction between biological and 
social factors as they relate to crime.
bipolar disorder An emotional disturbance in 
which moods alternate between periods of wild ela-
tion and deep depression.
blameworthy Basing punishment solely on 
whether a person is responsible for wrongdoing and 
deserving of censure or blame.
booking Fingerprinting, photographing, and re-
cording personal information of a suspect in police 
custody.
boosters Professional shoplifters who steal with the 
intention of reselling stolen merchandise.
boot camps Short-term militaristic correctional fa-
cilities in which inmates undergo intensive physical 
conditioning and discipline.
apparent authority Authority that a third party, 
such as a customer, reasonably believes the agent 
has to perform the act in question.
appeal Taking a criminal case to a higher court on 
the grounds that the defendant was found guilty 
because of legal error or violation of constitutional 
rights; a successful appeal may result in a new trial.
arousal theory A view of crime suggesting that 
people who have a high arousal level seek powerful 
stimuli in their environment to maintain an optimal 
level of arousal. These stimuli are often associated 
with violence and aggression. Sociopaths may need 
greater than average stimulation to bring them up to 
comfortable levels of living; this need explains their 
criminal tendencies.
arraignment The step in the criminal justice 
process at which the accused are read the charges 
against them, asked how they plead, and advised of 
their rights. Possible pleas are guilty, not guilty, nolo 
contendere, and not guilty by reason of insanity.
arrest The taking of a person into the custody of 
the law, the legal purpose of which is to restrain the 
accused until he or she can be held accountable for 
the offense at court proceedings. The legal require-
ment for an arrest is probable cause. Arrests for 
investigation, suspicion, or harassment are improper 
and of doubtful legality. The police have the respon-
sibility to use only the reasonable physical force 
necessary to make an arrest. The summons has been 
used as a substitute for arrest.
arson for profi t People looking to collect insur-
ance money, but who are afraid or unable to set the 
fi re themselves, hire professional arsonists. These 
professionals have acquired the skills to set fi res, yet 
make the cause seem accidental.
arson fraud A business owner burns his or her 
property, or hires someone to do it, to escape fi nan-
cial problems.
assigned counsel system A list of private bar 
members who accept cases of indigent criminals on 
a judge-by-judge, court-by-court, or case-by-case 
basis. This system is used in less populated areas, 
where case fl ow is minimal and a full-time public 
defender is not needed.
at risk Children and adults who lack the education 
and skills needed to be effectively in demand in 
modern society.
atavistic anomalies According to Lombroso, the 
physical characteristics that distinguish born crimi-
nals from the general population and are throw-
backs to animals or primitive people.
attachment theory The belief that the ability to 
form attachments—that is, emotionally bond to an-
other person—has important lasting psychological 
implications that follow people across the life span.
attention defi cit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) A psychological disorder in which a child 
shows developmentally inappropriate impulsivity, 
hyperactivity, and lack of attention.
Auburn system The prison system developed 
in New York during the nineteenth century that 
stressed congregate working conditions.
acquaintance rape Forcible sex in which offender 
and victim are acquainted with each other.
acquaintance robbery Robbers who focus their 
thefts on people they know.
active precipitation The view that the source of 
many criminal incidents is the aggressive or pro-
vocative behavior of victims.
actual authority The authority a corporation 
knowingly gives to an employee.
adjudication (adult) The determination of guilt or 
innocence; a judgment concerning criminal charges.
adjudication (juvenile) The juvenile court hearing 
at which the juvenile is declared a delinquent or sta-
tus offender, or no fi nding of fact is made.
adolescent-limited offender Offender who fol-
lows the most common criminal trajectory, in which 
antisocial behavior peaks in adolescence and then 
diminishes.
age-graded theory A developmental theory that 
posits that (a) individual traits and childhood expe-
riences are important to understand the onset of de-
linquent and criminal behavior; (b) experiences in 
young adulthood and beyond can redirect criminal 
trajectories or paths; (c) serious problems in adoles-
cence undermine life chances; (d) positive life expe-
riences and relationships can help a person knife off 
from a criminal career path; (e) positive life experi-
ences such as gaining employment, getting married, 
or joining the military create informal social control 
mechanisms that limit criminal behavior opportuni-
ties; (f) former criminals may choose to desist from 
crime because they fi nd more conventional paths 
more benefi cial and rewarding.
aggravated rape Rape involving multiple offenders, 
weapons, and victim injuries.
aging out The process by which individuals reduce 
the frequency of their offending behavior as they age.

GLOSSARY  659
brothel A house of prostitution, typically run by 
a madam who sets prices and handles “business” 
arrangements.
brutalization effect The belief that capital 
punishment creates an atmosphere of brutality 
that enhances rather than deters the level of vio-
lence in society. The death penalty reinforces the 
view that violence is an appropriate response to 
provocation.
California Personality Inventory (CPI) A fre-
quently administered personality test used to distin-
guish deviant groups from nondeviant groups.

leniency with which police treat female offenders.
chronic offender According to Wolfgang, a delin-
quent offender who is arrested fi ve or more times 
before he or she is 18 stands a good chance of 
becoming an adult criminal; such offenders are re-
sponsible for more than half of all serious crimes.
chronic victimization Those who have been crime 
victims maintain a signifi cantly higher chance of 
future victimization than people who have remained 
nonvictims. Most repeat victimizations occur soon 
after a previous crime has occurred, suggesting that 
repeat victims share some personal characteristic 
that makes them a magnet for predators.
civil law The set of rules governing relations be-
tween private parties, including both individuals 
and organizations (such as business enterprises and/
or corporations). The civil law is used to resolve,

thinkers believed that criminals choose to commit 
crime and that crime can be controlled by judicious 
punishment.
cleared crimes Crimes are cleared in two ways: 
when at least one person is arrested, charged, and 
turned over to the court for prosecution; or by ex-
ceptional means, when some element beyond police 
control precludes the physical arrest of an offender 
(for example, the offender leaves the country).

the cultural and social values of the middle class 
and actively strives to be successful by those stan-

hopeless path, because he is ill-equipped academi-
cally, socially, and linguistically to achieve the re-
wards of middle-class life.

investment in conventional institutions, individuals, 
and processes that prevents people from engaging in 
behavior that might jeopardize their reputation and 
achievements.
common law Early English law, developed by 
judges, that incorporated Anglo-Saxon tribal cus-
tom, feudal rules and practices, and the everyday 
rules of behavior of local villages. Common law 
became the standardized law of the land in England 
and eventually formed the basis of the criminal law 
in the United States.
Communist Manifesto In this document, Marx 
focused his attention on the economic conditions 
perpetuated by the capitalist system. He stated that 
its development had turned workers into a dehu-
manized mass who lived an existence that was at the 
mercy of their capitalist employers.
community-oriented policing (COP) A police 
strategy that emphasizes fear reduction, community 
organization, and order maintenance rather than 
crime fi ghting.
community service restitution An alternative 
sanction that requires an offender to work in the 
community at such tasks as cleaning public parks 
or helping handicapped children in lieu of an incar-
ceration sentence.
complaint A sworn allegation made in writing to 
a court or judge that an individual is guilty of some 
designated (complained of) offense. This is often 
the fi rst legal document fi led regarding a criminal 
offense. The complaint can be “taken out” by the 
victim, the police offi cer, the district attorney, or 
another interested party. Although the complaint 
charges an offense, an indictment or information 
may be the formal charging document.

stroys existing programs and networks, causing 
them to perform the task for which the virus was 
designed.
computer worms Programs that attack computer 
networks (or the Internet) by self-replicating and 
sending themselves to other users, generally via 
e-mail without the aid of the operator.
concentration effect Working- and middle-class 
families fl ee inner-city poverty areas, resulting in the 
most disadvantaged population being consolidated 
in the most disorganized urban neighborhoods.  
concurrent sentences Literally, running sentences 
together. Someone who is convicted of two or more 
charges must be sentenced on each charge. If the 
sentences are concurrent, they begin the same day 
and are completed after the longest term has been 
served.
conduct disorder Children with ADHD who con-
tinually engage in aggressive and antisocial behavior 
in early childhood.
conduct norms Behaviors expected of social group 
members. If group norms confl ict with those of the 
general culture, members of the group may fi nd 
themselves described as outcasts or criminals.
confi dence game A swindle, usually involving a 
get-rich-quick scheme, often with illegal overtones,

confi nement to punish unruly inmates, military 
regimentation, and discipline.

distinguishes between what is right and wrong.
consecutive sentences Prison sentences for two 
or more criminal acts that are served one after the 
other.
consensus view of crime The belief that the ma-
jority of citizens in a society share common ideals 
and work toward a common good and that crimes 
are acts that are outlawed because they confl ict with 
the rules of the majority and are harmful to society.
consent In prosecuting rape cases, it is essential to 
prove that the attack was forced and that the victim 
did not give voluntary consent to her attacker. In a 
sense, the burden of proof is on the victim to show 
that her character is beyond question and that she 
in no way encouraged, enticed, or misled the ac-
cused rapist. Proving victim dissent is not a require-
ment in any other violent crime.
constructive possession In the crime of larceny, 
willingly giving up temporary physical possession of 
property but retaining legal ownership.
contagion effect Genetic predispositions and early 
experiences make some people, including twins, sus-
ceptible to deviant behavior, which is transmitted by 
the presence of antisocial siblings in the household.
containment theory The idea that a strong self-
image insulates a youth from the pressures and pulls 
of criminogenic infl uences in the environment.
contextual discrimination A practice in which 
African Americans receive harsher punishments in 
some instances (as when they victimize whites) but 
not in others (as when they victimize other blacks).
continuity of crime The view that crime begins 
early in life and continues throughout the life 
course. Thus, the best predictor of future criminality 
is past criminality.
contract attorney system Providing counsel to in-
digent offenders by having attorneys under contract 
to the county handle some or all such cases.
corner boy According to Cohen, a role in the lower-
class culture in which young men remain in their 
birth neighborhood, acquire families and menial jobs,

preventing terrorist attacks within the United States, 
reducing America’s vulnerability to terrorism, and 
minimizing the damage and aiding recovery from 
attacks that do occur.
determinate sentences Fixed terms of incarcera-
tion, such as three years’ imprisonment. Determi-
nate sentences are felt by many to be too restrictive 
for rehabilitative purposes; the advantage is that of-
fenders know how much time they have to serve— 
that is, when they will be released.
deterrence theory The view that if the probability 
of arrest, conviction, and sanctioning increases, 
crime rates should decline.
deterrent effect The ability of crime control mea-
sures to end or eliminate crime. Deterrence may 
be achieved by the actual application of the law or 
by the creation of a perception that crime will be 
 detected and punished.
developmental criminology A view of criminal be-
havior that places emphasis on the changes people

ist society.
cross-examination The process in which the 
defense and the prosecution interrogate witnesses 
during a trial.
cross-sectional survey Survey data derived from all 
age, race, gender, and income segments of the popu-
lation measured simultaneously. Because people from 
every age group are represented,  age-specifi c crime 
rates can be determined. Proponents believe this is a 
suffi cient substitute for the more expensive longitu-
dinal approach that follows a group of subjects over 
time to measure crime rate changes.
crusted over Children who have been victims of or 
witnesses to violence and do not let people inside, 
nor do they express their feelings. They exploit others 
and in turn are exploited by those older and stronger; 
as a result, they develop a sense of hopelessness.
cult terrorists Cults that can be classifi ed as terror 
groups because their leaders demand that followers 
prove their loyalty through violence or intimidation. 
Members typically follow a charismatic leader who 
may be viewed as having godlike powers or even 
being the reincarnation of an important religious 
fi gure. The leader and his or her lieutenants com-
monly enforce loyalty by severe discipline and by 
physically preventing members from leaving the 
group. They may go through doomsday drills and 
maintain a siege mentality, fearing attacks from the 
government. The cult may openly or tacitly endorse 
individual killings or mass murder, which may be 
accompanied by mass suicide.

theory that sees strain and social disorganization to-
gether resulting in a unique lower-class culture that 
confl icts with conventional social norms.
cultural transmission The concept that conduct 
norms are passed down from one generation to the 
next so that they become stable within the boundar-
ies of a culture. Cultural transmission guarantees that 
group lifestyle and behavior are stable and predictable.
culture confl ict According to Sellin, a condition 
brought about when the rules and norms of an indi-
vidual’s subcultural affi liation confl ict with the role 
demands of conventional society.

lower class of society form a separate culture with 
its own values and norms that are in confl ict with 
conventional society; the culture is self-maintaining 
and ongoing.
cumulative disadvantage A condition in which 
repeated negative experiences in adolescence under-
mine life chances and reduce employability and so-
cial relations. People who increase their cumulative 
disadvantage risk continued offending.
cyberbullying Willful and repeated harm infl icted 
through the medium of electronic text.
cybercrime The use of modern technology for 
criminal purposes.

electronic communications devices to stalk another 
person. Some cyberstalkers pursue minors through 
covert pathway A path to a criminal career that 
begins with minor underhanded behavior and pro-
gresses to fi re starting and theft.
crackdowns The concentration of police resources 
on particular problem areas, such as street-level drug 
dealing, to eradicate or displace criminal activity.
crime control model A model of criminal justice 
that emphasizes the control of dangerous offenders 
and the protection of society. Its advocates call for 
harsh punishments, such as the death penalty, as a 
deterrent to crime.
crime discouragers Discouragers can be grouped 
into three categories: guardians, who monitor 
targets (such as store security guards); handlers, 
who monitor potential offenders (such as parole 
offi cers and parents); and managers, who moni-
tor places (such as homeowners and doorway 
attendants).
crime typology The study of criminal behavior 
involving research on the links between different 
types of crime and criminals. Because people often 
disagree about types of crimes and criminal moti-
vation, no standard exists within the fi eld. Some 
typologies focus on the criminal, suggesting the 
existence of offender groups, such as professional 
criminals, psychotic criminals, occasional criminals, 
and so on. Others focus on the crimes, clustering 
them into categories such as property crimes, sex 
crimes, and so on.

crime victims.
critical criminologists Researchers who view 
crime as a function of the capitalist mode of produc-
tion and not the social confl ict that might occur in 
any society regardless of its economic system.
critical criminology The view that capitalism 
produces haves and have-nots, each engaging in 
a particular branch of criminality. The mode of

rates at specifi c locations or neighborhoods may be 
redirecting offenders to alternative targets. 
disposition For juvenile offenders, the equivalent 
of sentencing for adult offenders. The theory is that 
disposition is more rehabilitative than retributive. 
Possible dispositions may be to dismiss the case, re-
lease the youth to the custody of his or her parents, 
place the offender on probation, or send him or her 
to a correctional institution. For adult defendants 
found guilty, sentencing usually involves a fi ne, pro-
bation, and/or incarceration.

fi ned confl ict situations in which an individual who 
has been offended by a negative outcome in a dis-
pute seeks reparations through violent means.

criminal justice system, thus avoiding the stigma of 
a criminal label.

wealth dominates and undermines social and com-
munity values.
instrumental crimes Offenses designed to improve 
the fi nancial or social position of the criminal.
instrumental theory The view that criminal law 
and the criminal justice system are capitalist instru-
ments for controlling the lower class.
instrumental violence Violence used in an attempt 
to improve the fi nancial or social position of the 
criminal.
insurgent The typical goal of an insurgency is to 
confront the existing government for control of all 
or a portion of its territory, or force political conces-
sions in sharing political power. While terrorists 
may operate in small bands with a narrow focus, 
insurgents represent a popular movement and may 
also seek external support from other nations to 
bring pressure on the government.
integrated theories Models of crime causation that 
weave social and individual variables into a complex 
explanatory chain.
intelligence A person’s ability to reason, compre-
hend ideas, solve problems, think abstractly, under-
stand complex ideas, learn from experience, and 
discover solutions to complex problems. 
intelligence-led policing (ILP) Policing based on 
collection and analysis of information to produce 
informed decision making at both the tactical and 
strategic levels.
intensive probation supervision (IPS) A type of 
intermediate sanction involving small probation 
caseloads and strict daily or weekly monitoring.
intensive supervision parole (ISP) A type of pa-
role that uses close surveillance and limited caseload 
sizes. ISP clients are required to have more offi ce 
and home visits than routine parolees. ISP may also 
require frequent drug testing, a term in a commu-
nity correctional center, and electronic monitoring 
in the home.
interactionist view The view that one’s perception 
of reality is signifi cantly infl uenced by one’s inter-
pretations of the reactions of others to similar events 
and stimuli.
intermediate sanctions An alternative to prison; 
these sanctions include fi nes, forfeiture, home con-
fi nement, electronic monitoring, intensive probation 
supervision, restitution, community corrections, 
and boot camps.
interrogation The questioning of a suspect in po-
lice custody.
hypoglycemia A condition that occurs when 
glucose (sugar) levels in the blood fall below the 
necessary level for normal and effi cient brain 
functioning.
id The primitive part of people’s mental makeup, 
present at birth, that represents unconscious bio-
logical drives for food, sex, and other life-sustaining 
necessities. The id seeks instant gratifi cation without 
concern for the rights of others.
identity crisis A psychological state, identifi ed by 
Erikson, in which youth face inner turmoil and un-
certainty about life roles.

that indicates little caring for the feelings of others.
indeterminate sentence A term of incarceration 
with a stated minimum and maximum length, such 
as a sentence to prison for a period of from 3 to 
10 years. The prisoner would be eligible for parole 
after the minimum sentence had been served. Based 
on the belief that sentences should fi t the criminal, 
indeterminate sentences allow individualized sen-
tences and provide for sentencing fl exibility. Judges 
can set a high minimum to override the purpose of 
the indeterminate sentence.
index crimes The eight crimes that, because of 
their seriousness and frequency, the FBI reports the 
incidence of in the annual Uniform Crime Report. 
Index crimes include murder, rape, assault, robbery, 
burglary, arson, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.

grand jury charging an individual with a specifi ed 
crime, based on the prosecutor’s presentation of

inferiority complex People who have feelings of 
inferiority and compensate for them with a drive for 
superiority.
infl uence peddling Using an institutional position 
to grant favors and sell information to which their 
co-conspirators are not entitled.
informal sanctions Disapproval, stigma, or anger 
directed toward an offender by signifi cant others 
(parents, peers, neighbors, teachers), resulting in 
shame, embarrassment, and loss of respect.
information Like an indictment, a formal charging

information and fi les it in court. Probable cause is 
determined at the preliminary hearing, which, un-
like grand jury proceedings, is public and attended 
by the accused and his or her attorney.

gateway model An explanation of drug abuse that 
posits that users begin with a more benign drug 
(alcohol or marijuana) and progress to more potent 
drugs.
general deterrence A crime control policy that 
depends on the fear of criminal penalties. General 
deterrence measures, such as long prison sentences 
for violent crimes, are aimed at convincing the 
potential law violator that the pains associated with 
crime outweigh its benefi ts.
General Strain Theory (GST) According to Ag-
new, the view that multiple sources of strain interact 
with an individual’s emotional traits and responses 
to produce criminality.
General Theory of Crime (GTC) According to 
Gottfredson and Hirschi, a developmental theory 
that modifi es social control theory by integrating 
concepts from biosocial, psychological, routine 
 activities, and rational choice theories.
gentrifi cation A residential renewal stage in which 
obsolete housing is replaced and upgraded; areas 
undergoing such change seem to experience an in-
crease in their crime rates.
globalization The process of creating transnational 
markets, politics, and legal systems in an effort to 
form and sustain a global economy.

sonal integrity, specialization in burglary, fi nancial 
success, and the ability to avoid prison sentences.

zens) chosen to hear testimony in secret and to issue 
formal criminal accusations (indictments). It also 
serves an investigatory function.
grand larceny Theft of money or property of sub-
stantial value, punished as a felony.
green-collar crime Acts involving illegal environ-
mental harm that violate environmental laws and 
regulations.

insula. Today the term is used interchangeably with 
the term “terrorist.”

web enterprises such as eBay, Amazon, PayPal, and 
America Online in an effort to get the recipient to 
reveal personal and fi nancial information.
pigeon drop A con game in which a package or 
wallet containing money is “found” by a con man 
or woman. A passing victim is stopped and asked 
for advice about what to do, and soon another 
“stranger,” who is part of the con, approaches and 
enters the discussion. The three decide to split the 
money; but fi rst, one of the swindlers goes off to 
consult a lawyer. The lawyer claims the money can 
be split up, but each party must prove he or she has 
the means to reimburse the original owner, should 
one show up. The victim then is asked to give some 
good-faith money for the lawyer to hold. When the 
victim goes to the lawyer’s offi ce to pick up a share 
of the loot, he or she fi nds the address bogus and 
the money gone. In the new millennium, the pigeon 
drop has been appropriated by corrupt telemarket-
ers, who contact typically elderly victims over the 
phone to bilk them out of their savings.
pilferage Theft by employees through stealth or 
deception.
plea bargaining The discussion between the de-
fense counsel and the prosecution by which the 
accused agrees to plead guilty for certain consid-

advantage to the prosecution is that a conviction is 
obtained without the time and expense of lengthy 
trial proceedings.

role offi cer, refrain from criminal conduct, maintain 
and support his or her family, avoid contact with 
other convicted criminals, abstain from using alco-
hol and drugs, remain within the jurisdiction, and 
so on. Violations of the conditions of parole may 
result in revocation of parole, in which case the 
individual will be returned to prison. The concept 
behind parole is to allow the release of the offender 
to community supervision, where rehabilitation and 
readjustment will be facilitated.
parole grant hearing A meeting of the full parole 
board or a subcommittee that reviews informa-
tion, may meet with the offender, and then decides 
whether the parole applicant has a reasonable 
chance of succeeding outside prison. Good time 
credits reduce the minimum sentence and hasten 
eligibility for parole. In making its decision, the 
board considers the inmate’s offense, time served, 
evidence of adjustment, and opportunities on the 
outside.

of the neocortex controls sympathetic feelings to-
ward others.
networks When referring to terrorist organiza-
tions, networks are loosely organized groups located 
in different parts of the city, state, or country (or 
world) that share a common theme or purpose, but 
have a diverse leadership and command structure 
and are only in intermittent communication with 
one another.
neuroallergies Allergies that affect the nervous 
system and cause the allergic person to produce 
enzymes that attack wholesome foods as if they 
were dangerous to the body. They may also cause 
swelling of the brain and produce sensitivity in the 
central nervous system—conditions that are linked 
to mental, emotional, and behavioral problems.
neurophysiology The study of brain activity. 
neutralization theory Neutralization theory holds 
that offenders adhere to conventional values while 
“drifting” into periods of illegal behavior. In order to 
drift, people must fi rst overcome (neutralize) legal 
and moral values.

decides to drop a case after a complaint has been 
formally made. Reasons for a nolle prosequi include 
insuffi cient evidence, reluctance of witnesses to tes-
tify, police error, and offi ce policy.

and labeling offenders does more harm than good, 
that youthful offenders in particular should be di-
verted into informal treatment programs, and that

ted in the heat of passion or during a sudden quar-
rel; although intent may be present, malice is not;

from the same environmental factors.
obscenity According to current legal theory, sexu-
ally explicit material that lacks a serious purpose and 
appeals solely to the prurient interest of the viewer. 
While nudity per se is not usually considered ob-
scene, open sexual behavior, masturbation, and exhi-
bition of the genitals is banned in most communities.

incarceration of felony offenders for terms of one 
year or more.

to occur. For example, they stop motor vehicles to 
issue citations and aggressively arrest and detain 
suspicious persons.
probable cause The evidentiary criterion necessary 
to sustain an arrest or the issuance of an arrest or 
search warrant; less than absolute certainty or “beyond 
a reasonable doubt” but greater than mere suspicion 
or hunch. A set of facts, information, circumstances, 
or conditions that would lead a reasonable person to 
believe that an offense was committed and that the ac-
cused committed that offense. An arrest made without 
probable cause may be susceptible to prosecution as 
an illegal arrest under false imprisonment statutes.

there is suffi cient evidence to warrant a trial; also 
called a preliminary hearing.

management that stresses proactive problem solving 
rather than reactive crime fi ghting.

dure are the rules of evidence, the law of arrest, the 
law of search and seizure, questions of appeal, jury 
selection, and the right to counsel.

branch) in criminal proceedings; advocate for the 
state’s case—the charge—in the adversary trial; for 
example, the attorney general of the United States, 
U.S. attorneys, attorneys general of the states, dis-
trict attorneys, and police prosecutors. The prosecu-
tor participates in investigations both before and 
after arrest, prepares legal documents, participates 
in obtaining arrest or search warrants, and decides 
whether to charge a suspect and, if so, with which 
offense. The prosecutor argues the state’s case at 
trial, advises the police, participates in plea negotia-
tions, and makes sentencing recommendations.
prostitution The granting of nonmarital sexual ac-
cess for remuneration.
psychoanalytic or psychodynamic perspective 
Branch of psychology holding that the human 
 personality is controlled by unconscious mental

biological, psychological, or economic forces.
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Psycholog-
ical reaction to a highly stressful event; symptoms 
may include depression, anxiety, fl ashbacks, and 
recurring nightmares.
power–control theory The view that gender dif-
ferences in crime are a function of economic power 
(class position, one-earner versus two-earner 
families) and parental control (paternalistic versus 
egalitarian families).
precedent A rule derived from previous judicial 
decisions and applied to future cases; the basis of 
common law.
preemptive deterrence Efforts to prevent crime 
through community organization and youth 
involvement.
preliminary hearings The step at which criminal 
charges initiated by an information are tested for 
probable cause; the prosecution presents enough 
evidence to establish probable cause—that is, a 
prima facie case. The hearing is public and may be 
attended by the accused and his or her attorney.
premeditation Consideration of a homicide before 
it occurs.
premenstrual syndrome (PMS) The stereotype 
that several days prior to and during menstruation 
females are beset by irritability and poor judgment 
as a result of hormonal changes.
presentencing investigation An investigation 
performed by a probation offi cer attached to a 
trial court after the conviction of a defendant. The 
report contains information about the defendant’s 
background, education, previous employment, and 
family; his or her own statement concerning the of-
fense; the person’s prior criminal record; interviews 
with neighbors or acquaintances; and his or her 
mental and physical condition (that is, information 
that would not be made part of the record in the 
case of a guilty plea or that would be inadmissible 
as evidence at a trial but could be infl uential and 
important at the sentencing stage). After conviction, 
a judge sets a date for sentencing (usually 10 days 
to two weeks from the date of conviction), during 
which time the presentence report is made. The re-
port is required in felony cases in federal courts and 
in many states, is optional with the judge in some 
states, and in others is mandatory before convicted 
offenders can be placed on probation. In the case 
of juvenile offenders, the presentence report is also 
known as a social history report.
preventive detention The practice of holding dan-
gerous suspects before trial without bail.
primary deviance According to Lemert, deviant 
acts that do not help redefi ne the self-image and 
public image of the offender.
primary prevention programs Treatment pro-
grams that seek to correct or remedy personal prob-
lems before they manifest themselves as crime.

is immoral.
violentization process According to Lonnie 
Athens, the process by which abused children are 
turned into aggressive adults. This process takes 
violent youths full circle from being the victims of 
aggression to its initiators; they are now the same 
person they grew up despising, ready to begin the 
process with their own children.
virility mystique The belief that males must 
separate their sexual feelings from needs for love, 
respect, and affection.
voir dire The process in which a potential jury panel

ally tinged laws, such as those governing prostitu-
tion, gambling, and pornography.
victim compensation The victim ordinarily 
receives compensation from the state to pay for 
damages associated with the crime. Rarely are two 
compensation schemes alike, however, and many 
state programs suffer from lack of both adequate 
funding and proper organization within the criminal 
justice system. Compensation may be made for 
medical bills, loss of wages, loss of future earnings, 
and counseling. In the case of death, the victim’s 
survivors can receive burial expenses and aid for 
loss of support.
victim precipitation theory The idea that the 
victim’s behavior was the spark that ignited the 
subsequent offense, as when the victim abused the 
offender verbally or physically.
victimization (by the justice system) While the 
crime is still fresh in their minds, victims may fi nd 
that the police interrogation following the crime is 
handled callously, with innuendos or insinuations 
that they were somehow at fault. Victims have diffi -
culty learning what is going on in the case; property 
is often kept for a long time as evidence and may 
never be returned. Some rape victims report that 
the treatment they receive from legal, medical, and 
mental health services is so destructive that they 
cannot help but feel “re-raped.”
