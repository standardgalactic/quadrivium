Karl E. Case is Professor of Economics Emeritus at Wellesley College where he has taught for 34
years and served several tours of duty as Department Chair. He is a Senior Fellow at the Joint
Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University and a founding partner in the real estate
research firm of Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss, which produces the S&P Case-Shiller Index of home
prices. He serves as a member of the Index Advisory Committee of Standard and Poor’s, and along
with Ray Fair he serves on the Academic Advisory Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Before coming to Wellesley, he served as Head Tutor in Economics (director of undergradu-
ate studies) at Harvard, where he won the Allyn Young Teaching Prize. He was Associate Editor of
the Journal of Economic Perspectives and the Journal of Economic Education, and he was a member
of the AEA’s Committee on Economic Education.
Professor Case received his B.A. from Miami University in 1968; spent three years on active
duty in the Army, and received his Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University in 1976.
Professor Case’s research has been in the areas of real estate, housing, and public finance. He
is author or coauthor of five books, including Principles of Economics, Economics and Tax Policy,
and Property Taxation: The Need for Reform, and he has published numerous articles in profes-
sional journals.
For the last 25 years, his research has focused on real estate markets and prices. He has authored
numerous professional articles, many of which attempt to isolate the causes and consequences of
boom and bust cycles and their relationship to regional and national economic performance.
Ray C. Fair is Professor of Economics at Yale University. He is a member of the Cowles
Foundation at Yale and a Fellow of the Econometric Society. He received a B.A. in Economics
from Fresno State College in 1964 and a Ph.D. in Economics from MIT in 1968. He taught at
Princeton University from 1968 to 1974 and has been at Yale since 1974.
Professor Fair’s research has primarily been in the areas of macroeconomics and econometrics,
with particular emphasis on macroeconometric model building. He also has done work in the areas
of finance, voting behavior, and aging in sports. His publications include Specification, Estimation,
and Analysis of Macroeconometric Models (Harvard Press, 1984); Testing Macroeconometric Models
(Harvard Press, 1994); and Estimating How the Macroeconomy Works (Harvard Press, 2004).
Professor Fair has taught introductory and intermediate macroeconomics at Yale. He has
also taught graduate courses in macroeconomic theory and macroeconometrics.
Professor Fair’s U.S. and multicountry models are available for use on the Internet free of
charge. The address is http://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu. Many teachers have found that having stu-
dents work with the U.S. model on the Internet is a useful complement to an introductory
macroeconomics course.
Sharon M. Oster is the Dean of the Yale School of Management, where she is also the Frederic
Wolfe Professor of Economics and Management. Professor Oster joined Case and Fair as a coau-
thor in the ninth edition of this book. Professor Oster has a B.A. in Economics from Hofstra
University and a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University.
Professor Oster’s research is in the area of industrial organization.She has worked on problems of
diffusion of innovation in a number of different industries, on the effect of regulations on business,
and on competitive strategy. She has published a number of articles in these areas and is the author of
several books, including Modern Competitive Analysis and The Strategic Management of Nonprofits.
Prior to joining the School of Management at Yale, Professor Oster taught for a number of
years in Yale’s Department of Economics. In the department, Professor Oster taught introductory
and intermediate microeconomics to undergraduates as well as several graduate courses in indus-
trial organization. Since 1982, Professor Oster has taught primarily in the Management School,
where she teaches the core microeconomics class for MBA students and a course in the area of com-
petitive strategy. Professor Oster also consults widely for businesses and nonprofit organizations
and has served on the boards of several publicly traded companies and nonprofit organizations.

Our goal in the 10th edition, as it was in the first edition, is to instill in students a fascination
with both the functioning of the economy and the power and breadth of economics. The
first line of every edition of our book has been “The study of economics should begin with a
sense of wonder.” We hope that readers come away from our book with a basic understand-
ing of how market economies function, an appreciation for the things they do well, and a
sense of the things they do poorly. We also hope that readers begin to learn the art and sci-
ence of economic thinking and begin to look at some policy and even personal decisions in a
different way.
What’s New in This Edition?
 The years 2008–2009 became the fifth recession in the United States since 1970. One of
the new features of this edition is a discussion of this recession in the context of the
overall history of the U.S. economy. This most recent recession, however, required more
than the usual revisions, both because of its severity and because of the unusual nature
of both the events leading up to it and some of the remedies employed by the govern-
ment to deal with it.
 In June 2010, the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve had assets of $2.3 billion. Of these
assets, half, or just over $1.1 billion, was held in the form of mortgage-backed securities.
In 2007, the Fed held no mortgage-backed securities. In June 2010, commercial banks in
the United States held more than $900 billion in excess reserves at the Fed. In the past,
banks have held almost no excess reserves. These extraordinary changes at the Fed fol-
low on the heels of interventions by the federal government in financial operations of
numerous private banks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, as well as in companies
like AIG and General Motors. These extraordinary actions required substantial changes
throughout the macroeconomic chapters of this book. New material describing these
interventions appear in a number of chapters, both in the text itself and in the Economics
in Practice boxes. Revisions were also necessary in the background discussions of mone-
tary policy, since the existence of excess reserves considerably complicates the usual
workings of monetary policy.
 In the microeconomics area, there has been a good deal of exciting new work in the areas
of economic development, behavioral economics, and experimental economics. This
edition has added material in various places throughout the microeconomics chapters
that describe this work. A particular highlight is Chapter 36, which carefully lays out the
methodological approach used by researchers doing randomized experiments in the
economic development area and describes some of the results of that work.
 This edition has augmented the current research focus of many of the Economics in
Practice boxes. Historically, the boxes have focused principally on newspaper excerpts
related to the subject of the chapter. Beginning last edition and pushed through more
strongly this edition, we have added boxes that we hope will demonstrate more clearly
the ideas that lie at the heart of economic thinking. Thus, two thirds of the boxes in the
microeconomics and macroeconomics chapters relate an economic principle either to a
personal observation (why does Denzel Washington get paid what he does?) or to a
recent piece of economic research (new work by Emmanuel Saez on the fact that much
of modern wealth comes from wages rather than interest, Carola Frydman’s work on
executive compensation, and Rachel Croson’s work on gender and trust). When possi-
ble, we focus on work by younger scholars and on more recent research. It is our hope
that new students will be inspired by the wide breadth and exciting nature of the
research currently going on in economics as they read these boxes.

Preface

 A number of the chapters have been reworked to improve their readability. On the
microeconomics side, Chapters 9, 12, and 18 have been most affected. On the macroeco-
nomics side, the growth chapter, Chapter 32, has been completely rewritten. The other
major changes concern the new discussion needed for the 2008–2009 recession and the
new policy initiatives.
 We have added many new problems in the end-of-chapter materials, aiming for more
text-specific questions.
Economics is a social science. Its value is measured in part in terms of its ability to help
us understand the world around us and to grapple with some of the social issues of the
times: How do markets work, and why are they so powerful?  Why do firms earn profits, and
how are wages determined?  Does it matter to consumers if there are many firms in an indus-
try or only one?   In 2006, the top 20 percent of the households in the United States earned
48 percent of all income generated. Why do we see this income inequality, and why has it
been growing?  There is enormous poverty in many parts of the world. Are there ways to
intervene, either at the country level or the individual level?  In almost any marketplace in
the United States we see goods that were produced in countries from all over the world. U.S.
goods also travel to far corners of the world to be sold to consumers in Europe, Asia, and
Latin America. Why do we see the pattern we do? Across the globe, people are increasingly
worried about global warming. What tools can an economist bring to the table in helping to
solve this complex problem?  These questions are microeconomic questions. To answer
them, we need to learn how households and firms make decisions and how those decisions
are interconnected. As we begin to see the way in which market outcomes—like prices, prof-
its, industry growth, and the like—emerge from the interplay of decisions made by a legion
of households and firms, acting largely in their own interests, we hope that the reader’s sense
of wonder will grow.
As we go to press in 2010, the U.S. economy is slowly recovering from a very difficult
downturn, with many people still unsuccessfully seeking work. What causes an economy to
falter and unemployment rates to grow?  More generally, how do we measure and under-
stand economic growth?  Are there government policies that can help prevent downturns or
at least reduce their severity?   In 2010, in the United States we hear increasing worries about
the growing size of the government debt. Where did this debt come from, and are people
right to be worried?  These question are macroeconomic questions. The years 2008–2010
have been very challenging years in the macroeconomy for most of the world. In the United
States the government has used policies never used before, and we have all—macroecono-
mists and policy makers alike—struggled to figure out what works and what does not. For
someone studying macroeconomics, we are in the middle of an enormously exciting time.
The Foundation
The themes of Principles of Economics, 10th edition, are the same themes of the first nine edi-
tions. The purposes of this book are to introduce the discipline of economics and to provide
a basic understanding of how economies function. This requires a blend of economic theory,
institutional material, and real-world applications. We have maintained a balance between
these ingredients in every chapter. The hallmark features of our book are its:
1. Three-tiered explanations of key concepts (stories-graphs-equations)
2. Intuitive and accessible structure
3. International coverage
Three-Tiered Explanations: Stories-Graphs-Equations
Professors who teach principles of economics are faced with a classroom of students with
different abilities, backgrounds, and learning styles. For some students, analytical mater-
ial is difficult no matter how it is presented; for others, graphs and equations seem to
come naturally. The problem facing instructors and textbook authors is how to convey
the core principles of the discipline to as many students as possible without selling the

better students short. Our approach to this problem is to present most core concepts in
the following three ways:
First, we present each concept in the context of a simple intuitive story or example in
words often followed by a table. Second, we use a graph in most cases to illustrate the story
or example. And finally, in many cases where appropriate, we use an equation to present the
concept with a mathematical formula.
Microeconomic Structure
The organization of the microeconomic chapters continues to reflect our belief that the best
way to understand how market economies operate—and the best way to understand basic
economic theory—is to work through the perfectly competitive model first, including dis-
cussions of output markets (goods and services) and input markets (land, labor, and capi-
tal), and the connections between them before turning to noncompetitive market structures
such as monopoly and oligopoly. When students understand how a simple, perfectly com-
petitive system works, they can start thinking about how the pieces of the economy “fit
together.” We think this is a better approach to teaching economics than some of the more
traditional approaches, which encourage students to think of economics as a series of dis-
connected alternative market models.
Learning perfect competition first also enables students to see the power of the market sys-
tem. It is impossible for students to discuss the efficiency of markets as well as the problems
that arise from markets until they have seen how a simple, perfectly competitive market system
produces and distributes goods and services. This is our purpose in Chapter 6 through 11.
Chapter 12, “General Equilibrium and the Efficiency of Perfect Competition,” is a piv-
otal chapter that links simple, perfectly competitive markets with a discussion of market
imperfections and the role of government. Chapter 13 through 15 cover three noncompeti-
tive market structures—monopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly. Chapter 16
covers externalities, public goods, and social choice. Chapter 17, which is new to this edition,
covers uncertainty and asymmetric information. Chapters 18 and 19 cover income distribu-
tion as well as taxation and government finance. The visual at the top of the next page
(Figure II.2 from page 118), gives you an overview of our structure.
Macroeconomic Structure
We remain committed to the view that it is a mistake simply to throw aggregate demand and
aggregate supply curves at students in the first few chapters of a principles book. To under-
stand the AS and AD curves, students need to know about the functioning of both the goods
market and the money market. The logic behind the simple demand curve is wrong when it
is applied to the relationship between aggregate demand and the price level. Similarly, the
logic behind the simple supply curve is wrong when it is applied to the relationship between
aggregate supply and the price level.
Part of teaching economics is teaching economic reasoning. Our discipline is built
around deductive logic. Once we teach students a pattern of logic, we want and expect them
to apply it to new circumstances. When they apply the logic of a simple demand curve or a
simple supply curve to the aggregate demand or aggregate supply curve, the logic does not
fit. We believe that the best way to teach the reasoning embodied in the aggregate demand
and aggregate supply curves without creating confusion for students is to build up to those
topics carefully.
In Chapter 23, “Aggregate Expenditure and Equilibrium Output,” and Chapter 24,
“The Government and Fiscal Policy,” we examine the market for goods and services. In
Chapter 25,“The Money Supply and the Federal Reserve System,” and Chapter 26,“Money
Demand and the Equilibrium Interest Rate,” we examine the money market. We bring the
two markets together in Chapter 27, “Aggregate Demand in the Goods and Money
Markets,” which explains the links between aggregate output (Y) and the interest rate (r)
and derives the AD curve. In Chapter 28, “Aggregate Supply and the Equilibrium Price
Level,” we introduce the AS curve and determine the equilibrium price level (P). We then
explain in Chapter 29, “The Labor Market in the Macroeconomy,” how the labor markets
Preface xix

fits into this macroeconomic picture. The figure at the top of the next page (Figure V.1
from page 457) gives you an overview of this structure.
One of the big issues in the organization of the macroeconomic material is whether
long-run growth issues should be taught before short-run chapters on the determination of
national income and countercyclical policy. In the last three editions, we moved a significant
discussion of growth to Chapter 22,“Unemployment, Inflation, and Long-Run Growth,”and
highlighted it. However, while we wrote Chapter 32, the major chapter on long-run growth,
so that it can be taught before or after the short-run chapters, we remain convinced that it is
easier for students to understand the growth issue once they have come to grips with the
logic and controversies of short-run cycles, inflation, and unemployment.
International Coverage
As in previous editions, we continue to integrate international examples and applications
throughout the text. This probably goes without saying: The days in which an introductory
economics text could be written with a closed economy in mind have long since gone.
Tools for Learning
As authors and teachers, we understand the challenges of the principles of economics course.
Our pedagogical features are designed to illustrate and reinforce key economic concepts
through real-world examples and applications.
Economics in Practice
As described earlier, the Economics in Practice feature presents a real-world personal observa-
tion, current research work, or a news article that supports the key concept of the chapter
and helps students think critically about how economics is a part of their daily lives. The

Graphs
Reading and interpreting graphs is a key part of understanding economic concepts. The
Chapter 1 Appendix,“How to Read and Understand Graphs,”shows readers how to interpret
the 200-plus graphs featured in this book. We use red curves to illustrate the behavior of
firms and blue curves to show the behavior of households. We use a different shade of red
and blue to signify a shift in a curve.

Problems and Solutions
Each chapter and appendix ends with a problem set that asks students to think about and
apply what they’ve learned in the chapter. These problems are not simple memorization
questions. Rather, they ask students to perform graphical analysis or to apply economics to a
real-world situation or policy decision. More challenging problems are indicated by an aster-
isk. Additional questions specific to the Economics in Practice feature have been added.
Several problems have been updated. The solutions to all of the problems are available in the
Instructor’s Manuals. Instructors can provide the solutions to their students so they can
check their understanding and progress.
MyEconLab
Both the text and supplement package provide ways for instructors and students to assess
their knowledge and progress through the course. MyEconLab, the new standard in person-
alized online learning, is a key part of Case, Fair, and Oster’s integrated learning package for
the 10th edition.
For the Instructor
MyEconLab is an online
course management, testing,
and 
tutorial 
resource.
Instructors can choose how
much or how little time to
spend setting up and using
MyEconLab.
Each chapter
contains two Sample Tests,
Study Plan Exercises, and
Tutorial Resources. Student
use of these materials requires
no initial setup by their instructor. The online Gradebook records each student’s performance
and time spent on the Tests and Study Plan and generates reports by student or by chapter.
Instructors can assign tests, quizzes, and homework in MyEconLab using four resources:
 Preloaded Sample Tests
 Problems similar to the end-of-chapter problems
 Test Item File questions
 Self-authored questions using Econ Exercise Builder
Exercises use multiple-choice, graph drawing, and free-response items, many of which
are generated algorithmically so that each time a student works them, a different variation is
presented. MyEconLab grades every problem, even those with graphs. When working home-
work exercises, students receive immediate feedback with links to additional learning tools.
Customization and Communication
MyEconLab in CourseCompass™ provides additional
optional customization and communication tools. Instructors who teach distance learning
courses or very large lecture sections find the CourseCompass format useful because they
can upload course documents and assignments, customize the order of chapters, and use
communication features such as Digital Drop Box and Discussion Board.
Experiments in MyEconLab
Experiments are a fun and engaging way to promote active learning and mastery of important
economic concepts. Pearson’s experiments program is flexible and easy for instructors and stu-
dents to use.
 Single-player experiments allow your students to play an experiment against virtual
players from anywhere at anytime with an Internet connection.

Preface

Preface xxiii
 Multiplayer experiments allow you to assign and manage a real-time experiment with
your class. In both cases, pre- and post-questions for each experiment are available for
assignment in MyEconLab.
For the Student
MyEconLab puts students in control of their learning through a collection of tests, practice, and
study tools tied to the online interactive version of the textbook, as well as other media resources.
Within MyEconLab’s structured environment,students practice what they learn,test their under-
standing, and pursue a personalized Study Plan generated from their performance on Sample
Tests and tests set by their instructors.At the core of MyEconLab are the following features:
 Sample Tests, two per chapter
 Personal Study Plan
 Tutorial Instruction
 Graphing Tool
Sample Tests
Two Sample Tests for each chapter are
preloaded in MyEconLab, enabling students to practice
what they have learned, test their understanding, and
identify areas in which they need further work. Students
can study on their own, or they can complete assign-
ments created by their instructor.
Personal Study Plan
Based on a student’s performance
on tests, MyEconLab generates a personal Study Plan
that shows where the student needs further study. The
Study Plan consists of a series of additional practice exer-
cises with detailed feedback and guided solutions that
are keyed to other tutorial resources.
Tutorial Instruction
Launched from many of the exer-
cises in the Study Plan, MyEconLab provides tutorial
instruction in the form of step-by-step solutions and
other media-based explanations.
Graphing Tool
A graphing tool is integrated into the
Tests and Study Plan exercises to enable students to make
and manipulate graphs. This feature helps students
understand how concepts, numbers, and graphs connect.
Additional MyEconLab Tools
MyEconLab includes the
following additional features:
1. Economics in the News—This feature provides weekly
updates during the school year of news items with links
to sources for further reading and discussion questions.
2. eText—While students are working in the Study Plan
or completing homework assignments, one of the
tutorial resources available is a direct link to the relevant page of the text so that students
can review the appropriate material to help them complete the exercise.
3. Glossary—This searchable version of the textbook glossary provides additional examples
and links to related terms.
4. Glossary Flashcards—Every key term is available as a flashcard, allowing students to quiz
themselves on vocabulary from one or more chapters at a time.
5. Research Navigator (CourseCompass™ version only)—This feature offers extensive help
on the research process and provides four exclusive databases of credible and reliable source
material, including the New York Times, the Financial Times, and peer-reviewed journals.
MyEconLab content has been created through the efforts of:
Charles Baum, Middle Tennessee State University; Sarah Ghosh, University of Scranton;
Russell Kellogg, University of Colorado–Denver; Bert G. Wheeler, Cedarville University; and
Noel Lotz and Douglas A. Ruby, Pearson Education

Resources for the Instructor
The following supplements are designed to make teaching and testing flexible and easy.
Instructor’s Manuals
Two Instructor’s Manuals, one for Principles of Microeconomics and one for Principles of
Macroeconomics, were prepared by Tony Lima of California State University, East Bay
(Hayward, California). The Instructor’s Manuals are designed to provide the utmost teaching
support for instructors. They include the following content:
 Detailed Chapter Outlines include key terminology, teaching notes, and lecture 
suggestions.
 Topics for Class Discussion provide topics and real-world situations that help ensure that
economic concepts resonate with students.
 Unique Economics in Practice features that are not in the main text provide extra real-
world examples to present and discuss in class.
 Teaching Tips provide tips for alternative ways to cover the material and brief reminders
on additional help to provide students. These tips include suggestions for exercises and
experiments to complete in class.
 Extended Applications include exercises, activities, and experiments to help make eco-
nomics relevant to students.
 Excel Workbooks, available for many chapters, make it easy to customize numerical
examples and produce graphs.
 Solutions are provided for all problems in the book.
Six Test Item Files
We have tailored the Test Item Files to help instructors easily and efficiently assess student
understanding of economic concepts and analyses. Test questions are annotated with the fol-
lowing information:
 Difficulty: 1 for straight recall, 2 for some analysis, 3 for complex analysis
 Type: Multiple-choice, true/false, short-answer, essay
 Topic: The term or concept the question supports
 Skill: Fact, definition, analytical, conceptual
 AACSB: See description in the next section.
The Test Item Files include questions with tables that students must analyze to solve for
numerical answers.The Test Item Files also contain questions based on the graphs that appear in
the book. The questions ask students to interpret the information presented in the graph. Many
questions require students to sketch a graph on their own and interpret curve movements.
Microeconomics Test Item File 1, by Randy Methenitis of Richland College: Test Item
File 1 (TIF1) includes over 2,700 questions. All questions are machine gradable and are
either multiple-choice or true/false. This Test Item File is for use with the 10th edition of
Principles of Microeconomics in the first year of publication. TIF1 is available in a computer-
ized format using TestGen EQ test-generating software and is included in MyEconLab.
Microeconomics Test Item File 2, by  Randy Methenitis of Richland College: This additional
Test Item File contains another 2,700 machine-gradable questions based on the TIF1 but regener-
ated to provide instructors with fresh questions when using the book the second year. This Test
Item File is available in a computerized format using TestGen EQ test-generating software.

The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
The authors of the Test
Item File have connected select Test Item File questions to the general knowledge and skill
guidelines found in the AACSB assurance of learning standards.
What Is the AACSB?
AACSB is a not-for-profit corporation of educational institutions, corpo-
rations,and other organizations devoted to the promotion and improvement of higher education
in business administration and accounting. A collegiate institution offering degrees in business
administration or accounting may volunteer for AACSB accreditation review. The AACSB makes
initial accreditation decisions and conducts periodic reviews to promote continuous quality
improvement in management education. Pearson Education is a proud member of the AACSB
and is pleased to provide advice to help you apply AACSB assurance of learning standards.
What Are AACSB Assurance of Learning Standards?
One of the criteria for AACSB accredi-
tation is quality of the curricula. Although no specific courses are required, the AACSB
expects a curriculum to include learning experiences in areas such as the following:
 Communication
 Ethical Reasoning
 Analytic Skills
 Use of Information Technology
 Multicultural and Diversity
 Reflective Thinking
Questions that test skills relevant to these guidelines are appropriately tagged. For exam-
ple, a question testing the moral questions associated with externalities would receive the
Ethical Reasoning tag.
Preface xxv

How Can Instructors Use the AACSB Tags?
Tagged questions help you measure whether
students are grasping the course content that aligns with the AACSB guidelines noted. In
addition, the tagged questions may help instructors identify potential applications of these
skills. This in turn may suggest enrichment activities or other educational experiences to
help students achieve these skills.
TestGen
The computerized TestGen package allows instructors to customize, save, and generate
classroom tests. The test program permits instructors to edit, add, or delete questions from
the Test Item Files; create new graphics; analyze test results; and organize a database of tests
and student results. This software allows for extensive flexibility and ease of use. It provides
many options for organizing and displaying tests, along with search and sort features. The
software and the Test Item Files can be downloaded from the Instructor’s Resource Center
(www.pearsonhighered.com/educator).
PowerPoint® Lecture Presentations
Six sets of PowerPoint® slides, three for Principles of Microeconomics and three for Principles
of Macroeconomics, prepared by Fernando Quijano of Dickinson State University and his
assistant Shelly Tefft, are available:
 A comprehensive set of PowerPoint® slides that can be used by instructors for class pre-
sentations or by students for lecture preview or review. The presentation includes all
the figures, photos, tables, key terms, and equations in the textbook. Two versions are
available—the first is in step-by-step mode so that you can build graphs as you would
on a blackboard, and the second is in automated mode, using a single click per slide.
 A comprehensive set of PowerPoint® slides with Classroom Response Systems (CRS)
questions built in so that instructors can incorporate CRS “clickers” into their classroom
lectures. For more information on Pearson’s partnership with CRS, see the description
below. Instructors may download these PowerPoint presentations from the Instructor’s
Resource Center (www.pearsonhighered.com/educator).
 Student versions of the PowerPoint presentations are available as .pdf files from the
book’s MyEconLab course. This version allows students to print the slides and bring
them to class for note taking.
Instructor’s Resource CD-ROM
The Instructor’s Resource CD-ROM contains all the faculty and student resources that sup-
port this text. Instructors have the ability to access and edit the following three supplements:
 Instructor’s Manuals
 Test Item Files
 PowerPoint® presentations
By clicking on a chapter or searching for a key word, faculty can access an interactive
library of resources. Faculty can pick and choose from the various supplements and export
them to their hard drives.
Classroom Response Systems
Classroom Response Systems (CRS) is an exciting new wireless polling technology that
makes large and small classrooms even more interactive because it enables instructors to
pose questions to their students, record results, and display the results instantly. Students can
answer questions easily by using compact remote-control transmitters. Pearson has partner-
ships with leading providers of classroom response systems and can show you everything
you need to know about setting up and using a CRS system. We provide the classroom hard-
ware, text-specific PowerPoint® slides, software, and support; and we show you how your
students can benefit. Learn more at www.pearsonhighered.com/crs.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

The Scope and
Method of Economics
The study of economics should
begin with a sense of wonder. Pause
for a moment and consider a typi-
cal day in your life. It might start
with a bagel made in a local bakery
with flour produced in Minnesota
from wheat grown in Kansas and
bacon from pigs raised in Ohio
packaged in plastic made in New
Jersey.
You spill coffee from
Colombia on your shirt made in
Texas from textiles shipped from
South Carolina.
After class you drive with a
friend on an interstate highway that is part of a system that took 20 years and billions of dollars
to build. You stop for gasoline refined in Louisiana from Saudi Arabian crude oil brought to the
United States on a supertanker that took 3 years to build at a shipyard in Maine.
Later you log onto the Web with a laptop assembled in Indonesia from parts made in China
and Skype with your brother in Mexico City, and you call a buddy on your iPhone with parts
from a dozen countries.You use or consume tens of thousands of things, both tangible and intan-
gible, every day: buildings, music, staples, paper, toothpaste, tweezers, pizza, soap, digital watches,
fire protection, banks, electricity, eggs, insurance, football fields, buses, rugs, subways, health ser-
vices, sidewalks, and so forth. Somebody made all these things. Somebody organized men and
women and materials to produce and distribute them. Thousands of decisions went into their
completion. Somehow they got to you.
In the United States, over 139 million people—almost half the total population—work at
hundreds of thousands of different jobs producing over $14 trillion worth of goods and services
every year. Some cannot find work; some choose not to work. Some are rich; others are poor.
The United States imports over $200 billion worth of automobiles and parts and about
$300 billion worth of petroleum and petroleum products each year; it exports around $62 billion
worth of agricultural products, including food. Every month the United States buys around 
$25 billion worth of goods and services from China, while China buys about $5 billion worth
from the United States. High-rise office buildings go up in central cities. Condominiums and
homes are built in the suburbs. In other places, homes are abandoned and boarded up.
Some countries are wealthy. Others are impoverished. Some are growing. Some are not.
Some businesses are doing well. Others are going bankrupt. As the 10th edition of our text goes to
press, the world is beginning to recover from a period during which many people felt the pain of
a major economic downturn. In the United States at the beginning of 2010 more than 15 million
people who wanted to work could not find a job. Millions around the world found themselves
with falling incomes and wealth.
At any moment in time, every society faces constraints imposed by nature and by previous
generations. Some societies are handsomely endowed by nature with fertile land, water, sunshine,

and natural resources. Others have deserts and few mineral resources. Some societies receive
much from previous generations—art, music, technical knowledge, beautiful buildings, and pro-
ductive factories. Others are left with overgrazed, eroded land, cities leveled by war, or polluted
natural environments. All societies face limits.

scarce
Limited.
The purpose of this chapter and the next is to elaborate on this definition and to introduce
the subject matter of economics. What is produced? How is it produced? Who gets it? Why? Is the
result good or bad? Can it be improved?
Why Study Economics?
There are four main reasons to study economics: to learn a way of thinking, to understand soci-
ety, to understand global affairs, and to be an informed citizen.
To Learn a Way of Thinking
Probably the most important reason for studying economics is to learn a way of thinking.
Economics has three fundamental concepts that, once absorbed, can change the way you look at
everyday choices: opportunity cost, marginalism, and the working of efficient markets.
Opportunity Cost
What happens in an economy is the outcome of thousands of individ-
ual decisions. People must decide how to divide their incomes among all the goods and services
available in the marketplace. They must decide whether to work, whether to go to school, and
how much to save. Businesses must decide what to produce, how much to produce, how much to
charge, and where to locate. It is not surprising that economic analysis focuses on the process of
decision making.
Nearly all decisions involve trade-offs. A key concept that recurs in analyzing the decision-
making process is the notion of opportunity cost. The full “cost” of making a specific choice
includes what we give up by not making the alternative choice. The best alternative that we
forgo, or give up, when we make a choice or a decision is called the opportunity cost of
that decision.
When asked how much a movie costs, most people cite the ticket price. For an econo-
mist, this is only part of the answer: to see a movie takes not only a ticket but also time. The
opportunity cost of going to a movie is the value of the other things you could have done
with the same money and time. If you decide to take time off from work, the opportunity
cost of your leisure is the pay that you would have earned had you worked. Part of the cost of
a college education is the income you could have earned by working full-time instead of
going to school. If a firm purchases a new piece of equipment for $3,000, it does so because
it expects that equipment to generate more profit. There is an opportunity cost, however,
because that $3,000 could have been deposited in an interest-earning account. To a society,
the opportunity cost of using resources to launch astronauts on a space shuttle is the value of
the private/civilian or other government goods that could have been produced with the 
same resources.
Opportunity costs arise because resources are scarce. Scarce simply means limited.
Consider one of our most important resources—time. There are only 24 hours in a day, and
we must live our lives under this constraint. A farmer in rural Brazil must decide whether 
it is better to continue to farm or to go to the city and look for a job. A hockey player at the
Economics is the study of how individuals and societies choose to use the scarce
resources that nature and previous generations have provided. The key word in this def-
inition is choose. Economics is a behavioral, or social, science. In large measure, it is the
study of how people make choices. The choices that people make, when added up, trans-
late into societal choices.

CHAPTER 1
The Scope and Method of Economics 3
marginalism
The process of
analyzing the additional or
incremental costs or benefits
arising from a choice or
decision.
University of Vermont must decide whether to play on the varsity team or spend more 
time studying.
Marginalism
A second key concept used in analyzing choices is the notion of marginalism.
In weighing the costs and benefits of a decision, it is important to weigh only the costs and bene-
fits that arise from the decision. Suppose, for example, that you live in New Orleans and that you
are weighing the costs and benefits of visiting your mother in Iowa. If business required that you
travel to Kansas City, the cost of visiting Mom would be only the additional, or marginal, time
and money cost of getting to Iowa from Kansas City.
Consider the video game business. It has been estimated that to create and produce a com-
plex multiplayer role-playing game like World of Warcraft (WOW) costs as much as $500 million.
Once the game has been developed, however, the cost of selling and delivering it to another player
is close to zero. The original investment (by Activision) made to create WOW is considered a
sunk cost. Once the game has been developed, Activision cannot avoid these costs because they
have already been incurred. Activision’s business decisions about pricing and distributing WOW
depend not on the sunk costs of production, but on the incremental or marginal costs of produc-
tion. For Activision, those costs are close to zero.
There are numerous examples in which the concept of marginal cost is useful. For an air-
plane that is about to take off with empty seats, the marginal cost of an extra passenger is essen-
tially zero; the total cost of the trip is roughly unchanged by the addition of an extra passenger.
Thus, setting aside a few seats to be sold at big discounts through www.priceline.com or other
Web sites can be profitable even if the fare for those seats is far below the average cost per seat of
making the trip. As long as the airline succeeds in filling seats that would otherwise have been
empty, doing so is profitable.
Efficient Markets—No Free Lunch
Suppose you are ready to check out of a busy
grocery store on the day before a storm and seven checkout registers are open with several
people in each line. Which line should you choose? Usually, the waiting time is approximately
the same no matter which register you choose (assuming you have more than 12 items). If one
line is much shorter than the others, people will quickly move into it until the lines are equal-
ized again.
As you will see later, the term profit in economics has a very precise meaning. Economists,
however, often loosely refer to “good deals” or risk-free ventures as profit opportunities. Using
the term loosely, a profit opportunity exists at the checkout lines when one line is shorter than
the others. In general, such profit opportunities are rare. At any time, many people are search-
ing for them; as a consequence, few exist. Markets like this, where any profit opportunities are
eliminated almost instantaneously, are said to be efficient markets. (We discuss markets, the
institutions through which buyers and sellers interact and engage in exchange, in detail in
Chapter 2.)
The common way of expressing the efficient markets concept is “there’s no such thing as a
free lunch.” How should you react when a stockbroker calls with a hot tip on the stock market?
With skepticism. Thousands of individuals each day are looking for hot tips in the market. If a
particular tip about a stock is valid, there will be an immediate rush to buy the stock, which will
quickly drive up its price. This view that very few profit opportunities exist can, of course, be
carried too far. There is a story about two people walking along, one an economist and one not.
The non-economist sees a $20 bill on the sidewalk and says,“There’s a $20 bill on the sidewalk.”
The economist replies,“That is not possible. If there were, somebody would already have picked
it up.”
There are clearly times when profit opportunities exist. Someone has to be first to get the
news, and some people have quicker insights than others. Nevertheless, news travels fast, and
there are thousands of people with quick insights. The general view that large profit opportuni-
ties are rare is close to the mark.
efficient market
A market in
which profit opportunities are
eliminated almost
instantaneously.
The study of economics teaches us a way of thinking and helps us make decisions.
sunk costs
Costs that 
cannot be avoided because
they have already been
incurred.

Introduction to Economics 
Industrial Revolution
The
period in England during the
late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries in which
new manufacturing
technologies and improved
transportation gave rise to the
modern factory system and a
massive movement of the
population from the
countryside to the cities.
To Understand Society
Another reason for studying economics is to understand society better. Past and present eco-
nomic decisions have an enormous influence on the character of life in a society. The current
state of the physical environment, the level of material well-being, and the nature and number of
jobs are all products of the economic system.
To get a sense of the ways in which economic decisions have shaped our environment,
imagine looking out a top-floor window of an office tower in any large city. The workday is
about to begin. All around you are other tall glass and steel buildings full of workers. In the
distance, you see the smoke of factories. Looking down, you see thousands of commuters
pouring off trains and buses and cars backed up on freeway exit ramps. You see trucks carry-
ing goods from one place to another. You also see the face of urban poverty: Just beyond 
the freeway is a large public housing project and, beyond that, burned-out and boarded-up
buildings.
What you see before you is the product of millions of economic decisions made over hun-
dreds of years. People at some point decided to spend time and money building those buildings
and factories. Somebody cleared the land, laid the tracks, built the roads, and produced the cars
and buses.
Economic decisions not only have shaped the physical environment but also have deter-
mined the character of society. At no time has the impact of economic change on a society been
more evident than in England during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, a
period that we now call the Industrial Revolution. Increases in the productivity of agriculture,
new manufacturing technologies, and development of more efficient forms of transportation
led to a massive movement of the British population from the countryside to the city. At the
beginning of the eighteenth century, approximately 2 out of 3 people in Great Britain worked
in agriculture. By 1812, only 1 in 3 remained in agriculture; by 1900, the figure was fewer than
1 in 10. People jammed into overcrowded cities and worked long hours in factories. England
had changed completely in two centuries—a period that in the run of history was nothing
more than the blink of an eye.
It is not surprising that the discipline of economics began to take shape during this
period. Social critics and philosophers looked around and knew that their philosophies must
expand to accommodate the changes. Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations appeared in 1776. It
was followed by the writings of David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Thomas Malthus, and others.
Each tried to make sense out of what was happening. Who was building the factories? Why?
What determined the level of wages paid to workers or the price of food? What would hap-
pen in the future, and what should happen? The people who asked these questions were the
first economists.
Similar changes continue to affect the character of life in more recent times. In fact, many
argue that the late 1990s marked the beginning of a new Industrial Revolution. As we turned the
corner into the new millennium, the “e” revolution was clearly having an impact on virtually
every aspect of our lives: the way we buy and sell products, the way we get news, the way we plan
vacations, the way we communicate with each other, the way we teach and take classes, and on
and on. These changes have had and will clearly continue to have profound impacts on societies
across the globe, from Beijing to Calcutta to New York.
These changes have been driven by economics. Although the government was involved in
the early years of the World Wide Web, private firms that exist to make a profit (such as
Facebook, YouTube, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google, Monster.com, Amazon.com, and E-Trade) cre-
ated almost all the new innovations and products. How does one make sense of all this? What
will the effects of these innovations be on the number of jobs, the character of those jobs, the
family incomes, the structure of our cities, and the political process both in the United States
and in other countries?
During the last days of August 2005, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the coasts of Louisiana
and Mississippi, causing widespread devastation, killing thousands, and leaving hundreds of
thousands homeless. The economic impact of this catastrophic storm was huge. Thinking about
various markets involved helps frame the problem.
For example, the labor market was massively affected. By some estimates, over 400,000 jobs
were lost as the storm hit. Hotels, restaurants, small businesses, and oil refineries, to name just a

CHAPTER 1
The Scope and Method of Economics 5
The study of economics is an essential part of the study of society.
To Understand Global Affairs
A third reason for studying economics is to understand global affairs. News headlines are filled
with economic stories. The environmental disaster associated with BP’s oil spill has the poten-
tial to affect the future price of oil if deep sea drilling is banned, the price of fish, the extent of
tourism, and tourist-related employment in the Gulf and numerous other markets. The dis-
covery in 2010 of major new diamond deposits in Zimbabwe has implications for the future
stability of Mugabe’s government, with implications for developments in the rest of the region.
China’s new position as a major trading partner of both the United States and Europe clearly
has implications for political interactions among these nations. Greece’s economic struggles in
2010 over its large debt is affecting the enthusiasm of the rest of Europe’s citizens for the
European Union.
In a relatively open, market-oriented world, it is impossible to understand political affairs with-
out a grounding in economics.While there is much debate about whether or not economic consider-
ations dominate international relations, it is clear that they play a role as political leaders seek the
economic well-being of their citizenry.
An understanding of economics is essential to an understanding of global affairs.
few, were destroyed. All the people who worked in those establishments instantaneously lost their
jobs and their incomes. The cleanup and rebuilding process took time to organize, and it eventu-
ally created a great deal of employment.
The storm created a major disruption in world oil markets. Loss of refinery capacity sent
gasoline prices up immediately, nearly 40 percent to over $4 per gallon in some locations. The
price per gallon of crude oil rose to over $70 per barrel. Local governments found their tax
bases destroyed, with no resources to pay teachers and local officials. Hundreds of hospitals
were destroyed, and colleges and universities were forced to close their doors, causing tens of
thousands of students to change their plans.
While the horror of the storm hit all kinds of people, the worst hit were the very poor, who
could not get out of the way because they had no cars or other means of escape. The storm raised
fundamental issues of fairness, which we will be discussing for years to come.
To Be an Informed Citizen
A knowledge of economics is essential to being an informed citizen. In 2009, most of the world
suffered from a major recession, with diminished economic growth and high unemployment.
Millions of people around the world lost their jobs. Governments from China to the United
Kingdom to the United States all struggled to figure out policies to help their economies recover.
Understanding what happens in a recession and what the government can and cannot do to help
in a recovery is an essential part of being an informed citizen.
Economics is also essential in understanding a range of other everyday government decisions
at the local and federal levels. Why do governments pay for public schools and roads, but not cell
phones? In 2010, the federal government under President Obama moved toward universal health
care for U.S. citizens. How do you understand the debate of whether this is or is not a good idea?
In some states, scalping tickets to a ball game is illegal. Is this a good policy or not? Some govern-
ments control the prices that firms can charge for some goods, especially essentials like milk and
bread. Is this a good idea? Every day, across the globe, people engage in political decision making
around questions like these, questions that depend on an understanding of economics.
To be an informed citizen requires a basic understanding of economics.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
iPod and the World
It is impossible to understand the workings of an economy without
first understanding the ways in which economies are connected
across borders. The United States was importing goods and services
at a rate of over $2 trillion per year in 2007 and was exporting at a
rate of over $1.5 trillion per year.
For literally hundreds of years, the virtues of free trade have been
the subject of heated debate. Opponents have argued that buying
foreign-produced goods costs Americans jobs and hurts American
producers. Proponents argue that there are gains from trade—that all
countries can gain from specializing in the production of the goods
and services they produce best.
In the modern world, it is not always easy to track where products
are made. A sticker that says “Made in China” can often be mislead-
ing. Recent studies of two iconic U.S. products, the iPod and the
Barbie doll, make this complexity clear.
The Barbie doll is one of Mattel’s best and longest selling prod-
ucts. The Barbie was designed in the United States. It is made of
plastic fashioned in Taiwan, which came originally from the Mideast
in the form of petroleum. Barbie’s hair comes from Japan, while the
cloth for her clothes mostly comes from China. Most of the assembly
of the Barbie also is done in China, using, as we see, pieces from
across the globe. A doll that sells for $10 in the United States carries
an export value when leaving Hong Kong of $2, of which only 
35 cents is for Chinese labor, with most of the rest covering trans-
portation and raw materials. Because the Barbie comes to the United
States from assembly in China and transport from Hong Kong, some
would count it as being produced in China. Yet, for this Barbie, $8 of
its retail value of $10 is captured by the United States!1
The iPod is similar. A recent study by three economists, Greg
Linden, Kenneth Kraemer, and Jason Dedrick, found that once one
includes Apple’s payment for its intellectual property, distribution
costs, and production costs for some components, almost 80% of
the retail price of the iPod is captured by the United States.2
Moreover, for some of the other parts of the iPod, it is not easy to tell
exactly where they are produced. The hard drive, a relatively expen-
sive component, was produced in Japan by Toshiba, but some of the
components of that hard drive were actually produced elsewhere in
Asia. Indeed, for the iPod, which is composed of many small parts, it
is almost impossible to accurately tell exactly where each piece was
produced without pulling it apart.
So, next time you see a label saying “Made in China” keep in mind
that from an economics point of view one often has to dig a little
deeper to see what is really going on.

microeconomics
The branch
of economics that examines
the functioning of individual
industries and the behavior of
individual decision-making
units—that is, firms and
households.
The Scope of Economics
Most students taking economics for the first time are surprised by the breadth of what they study.
Some think that economics will teach them about the stock market or what to do with their
money. Others think that economics deals exclusively with problems such as inflation and unem-
ployment. In fact, it deals with all those subjects, but they are pieces of a much larger puzzle.
Economics has deep roots in and close ties to social philosophy. An issue of great importance
to philosophers, for example, is distributional justice. Why are some people rich and others poor?
And whatever the answer, is this fair? A number of nineteenth-century social philosophers wres-
tled with these questions, and out of their musings, economics as a separate discipline was born.
The easiest way to get a feel for the breadth and depth of what you will be studying is to
explore briefly the way economics is organized. First of all, there are two major divisions of eco-
nomics: microeconomics and macroeconomics.
Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
Microeconomics deals with the functioning of individual industries and the behavior of individ-
ual economic decision-making units: firms and households. Firms’ choices about what to pro-
duce and how much to charge and households’ choices about what and how much to buy help to
explain why the economy produces the goods and services it does.
Another big question addressed by microeconomics is who gets the goods and services that
are produced. Wealthy households get more than poor households, and the forces that determine

CHAPTER 1
The Scope and Method of Economics 7
The Diverse Fields of Economics
Individual economists focus their research and study in many diverse areas. Many of these spe-
cialized fields are reflected in the advanced courses offered at most colleges and universities. Some
are concerned with economic history or the history of economic thought. Others focus on inter-
national economics or growth in less developed countries. Still others study the economics of
cities (urban economics) or the relationship between economics and law. These fields are sum-
marized in Table 1.2.
this distribution of output are the province of microeconomics. Why does poverty exist? Who is
poor? Why do some jobs pay more than others?
Think again about what you consume in a day, and then think back to that view over a big city.
Somebody decided to build those factories. Somebody decided to construct the roads, build the hous-
ing, produce the cars, and smoke the bacon.Why? What is going on in all those buildings? It is easy to
see that understanding individual microdecisions is very important to any understanding of society.
Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. Instead of trying to understand what
determines the output of a single firm or industry or what the consumption patterns are of a sin-
gle household or group of households, macroeconomics examines the factors that determine
national output, or national product. Microeconomics is concerned with household income;
macroeconomics deals with national income.
Whereas microeconomics focuses on individual product prices and relative prices, macro-
economics looks at the overall price level and how quickly (or slowly) it is rising (or falling).
Microeconomics questions how many people will be hired (or fired) this year in a particular
industry or in a certain geographic area and focuses on the factors that determine how much
labor a firm or an industry will hire. Macroeconomics deals with aggregate employment and
unemployment: how many jobs exist in the economy as a whole and how many people who are
willing to work are not able to find work.
To summarize:
macroeconomics
The branch
of economics that examines
the economic behavior of
aggregates—income,
employment, output, and so
on—on a national scale.
Microeconomics looks at the individual unit—the household, the firm, the industry. It
sees and examines the “trees.” Macroeconomics looks at the whole, the aggregate. It sees
and analyzes the “forest.”

The Fields of Economics
Behavioral economics
uses psychological theories relating to emotions and social context to help understand economic
decision making and policy. Much of the work in behavioral economics focuses on the biases that
individuals have that affect the decisions they make.
Comparative economic 
systems
examines the ways alternative economic systems function. What are the advantages and
disadvantages of different systems? 
Econometrics
applies statistical techniques and data to economic problems in an effort to test hypotheses and theo-
ries. Most schools require economics majors to take at least one course in statistics or econometrics.
Economic development
focuses on the problems of low-income countries. What can be done to promote development in
these nations? Important concerns of development for economists include population growth
and control, provision for basic needs, and strategies for international trade.
Economic history
traces the development of the modern economy. What economic and political events and scien-
tific advances caused the Industrial Revolution? What explains the tremendous growth and
progress of post—World War II Japan? What caused the Great Depression of the 1930s?
Environmental economics
studies the potential failure of the market system to account fully for the impacts of produc-
tion and consumption on the environment and on natural resource depletion. Have alter-
native public policies and new economic institutions been effective in correcting these
potential failures?
Finance
examines the ways in which households and firms actually pay for, or finance, their purchases. It
involves the study of capital markets (including the stock and bond markets), futures and
options, capital budgeting, and asset valuation.
Health economics
analyzes the health care system and its players: government, insurers, health care providers, and
patients. It provides insight into the demand for medical care, health insurance markets, cost-
controlling insurance plans (HMOs, PPOs, IPAs), government health care programs (Medicare
and Medicaid), variations in medical practice, medical malpractice, competition versus regula-
tion, and national health care reform.
The history of economic thought,
which is grounded in philosophy, studies the development of economic ideas and theories over
time, from Adam Smith in the eighteenth century to the works of economists such as Thomas
Malthus, Karl Marx, and John Maynard Keynes. Because economic theory is constantly develop-
ing and changing, studying the history of ideas helps give meaning to modern theory and puts it
in perspective.
Industrial organization
looks carefully at the structure and performance of industries and firms within an economy. How
do businesses compete? Who gains and who loses?
International economics
studies trade flows among countries and international financial institutions. What are the
advantages and disadvantages for a country that allows its citizens to buy and sell freely in world
markets? Why is the dollar strong or weak?
Labor economics
deals with the factors that determine wage rates, employment, and unemployment. How do peo-
ple decide whether to work, how much to work, and at what kind of job? How have the roles of
unions and management changed in recent years?
Law and economics
analyzes the economic function of legal rules and institutions. How does the law change the
behavior of individuals and businesses? Do different liability rules make accidents and injuries
more or less likely? What are the economic costs of crime?
Public economics
examines the role of government in the economy. What are the economic functions of
government, and what should they be? How should the government finance the services 
that it provides? What kinds of government programs should confront the problems 
of poverty, unemployment, and pollution? What problems does government involve-
ment create?
Urban and regional economics
studies the spatial arrangement of economic activity. Why do we have cities? Why are
manufacturing firms locating farther and farther from the center of urban areas?

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Trust and Gender
As you study economics, you will see that economists study quite a
large range of topics. In the experimental area, this seems to be espe-
cially true.An interesting recent example is a paper on gender and trust
by Nancy Buchan, Rachel Croson, and Sara Solnick.1
While many transactions happen in anonymous markets in which
buyers and sellers don’t know one another, there are many other occa-
sions in which markets operate more effectively if individuals develop
some trust in one another. Trust in the goodwill of your employer or of
the staff of your local day care can make a big difference in the ways in
which you transact business. What can economists say about who is or
is not trustworthy?
To answer this question, Buchan et al. used a game economists call
the Investment Game to explore the behavior of people when they
are not being observed. In this game, there are two players, a respon-
der and a sender, and the game begins with each person receiving $10
from the experimenter. The sender and responder are not known to
each other and are put in separate rooms. Sender begins and is told
he or she can send any or all of the $10 to the responder. Whatever is
sent will be tripled by the experimenter. The responder then can send
any or all of the money back.
Clearly the sender–responder pair stand to gain the most if the
sender sends all $10 and has it tripled by the experimenter. In this way
the pair could turn a starting sum of $20 ($10 each) to $40 (the tripled
$10 plus the responder’s original $10). As you will see in Chapter 14,
economists who work on game theory expect no money to be sent in
either direction: Because the sender doesn’t trust the responder to
share, he or she sends nothing in the first place.
What do Buchan et al. find? In experiments run at the University of
Wisconsin and the University of Miami, the experimenters found that
almost all subjects sent some money. Perhaps more interestingly, men
sent significantly more than women did, but women returned signifi-
cantly more than men. As the researchers conclude,“We find that men
trust more than women, and women are more trustworthy than men.”

Examination of Behavior, Biases, and Beliefs in the Investment Game.” Journal of
Economic Behavior and Organization, 2008: 68(3), 466–476.
Economists also differ in the emphasis they place on theory. Some economists specialize in
developing new theories, whereas other economists spend their time testing the theories of others.
Some economists hope to expand the frontiers of knowledge, whereas other economists are more
interested in applying what is already known to the formulation of public policies.
As you begin your study of economics, look through your school’s course catalog and talk to
the faculty about their interests. You will discover that economics encompasses a broad range of
inquiry and is linked to many other disciplines.
The Method of Economics
Economics asks and attempts to answer two kinds of questions: positive and normative.
Positive economics attempts to understand behavior and the operation of economic systems
without making judgments about whether the outcomes are good or bad. It strives to describe
what exists and how it works. What determines the wage rate for unskilled workers? What would
happen if we abolished the corporate income tax? The answers to such questions are the subject
of positive economics.
In contrast, normative economics looks at the outcomes of economic behavior and
asks whether they are good or bad and whether they can be made better. Normative eco-
nomics involves judgments and prescriptions for courses of action. Should the government
subsidize or regulate the cost of higher education? Should medical benefits to the elderly
under Medicare be available only to those with incomes below some threshold? Should the

economic theory
A
statement or set of related
statements about cause and
effect, action and reaction.
United States allow importers to sell foreign-produced goods that compete with U.S.-made
products? Should we reduce or eliminate inheritance taxes? Normative economics is often
called policy economics.
Of course, most normative questions involve positive questions. To know whether the govern-
ment should take a particular action, we must know first if it can and second what the conse-
quences are likely to be. (For example, if we lower import fees, will there be more competition
and lower prices?)
Some claim that positive, value-free economic analysis is impossible. They argue that ana-
lysts come to problems with biases that cannot help but influence their work. Furthermore, even
in choosing what questions to ask or what problems to analyze, economists are influenced by
political, ideological, and moral views.
Although this argument has some merit, it is nevertheless important to distinguish between
analyses that attempt to be positive and those that are intentionally and explicitly normative.
Economists who ask explicitly normative questions should be required to specify their grounds
for judging one outcome superior to another.
Descriptive Economics and Economic Theory
Positive economics is often divided into descriptive economics and economic theory. Descriptive
economics is simply the compilation of data that describe phenomena and facts. Examples of
such data appear in the Statistical Abstract of the United States, a large volume of data published
by the Department of Commerce every year that describes many features of the U.S. economy.
Massive volumes of data can now be found on the World Wide Web. As an example, look at www.
bls.gov (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
Where do these data come from? The Census Bureau collects an enormous amount of raw
data every year, as do the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and non-
government agencies such as the University of Michigan Survey Research Center. One important
study now published annually is the Survey of Consumer Expenditure, which asks individuals to
keep careful records of all their expenditures over a long period of time. Another is the National
Longitudinal Survey of Labor Force Behavior, conducted over many years by the Center for
Human Resource Development at the Ohio State University.
Economic theory attempts to generalize about data and interpret them.An economic theory
is a statement or set of related statements about cause and effect, action and reaction. One of the
first theories you will encounter in this text is the law of demand, which was most clearly stated by
Alfred Marshall in 1890: When the price of a product rises, people tend to buy less of it; when the
price of a product falls, people tend to buy more.
Theories do not always arise out of formal numerical data. All of us have been observing
people’s behavior and their responses to economic stimuli for most of our lives. We may have
observed our parents’ reaction to a sudden increase—or decrease—in income or to 
the loss of a job or the acquisition of a new one. We all have seen people standing in line waiting
for a bargain. Of course, our own actions and reactions are another important source of data.
Theories and Models
In many disciplines, including physics, chemistry, meteorology, political science, and economics,
theorists build formal models of behavior. A model is a formal statement of a theory. It is usually
a mathematical statement of a presumed relationship between two or more variables.
A variable is a measure that can change from time to time or from observation to observa-
tion. Income is a variable—it has different values for different people and different values for the
same person at different times. The rental price of a movie on a DVD is a variable; it has different
values at different stores and at different times. There are countless other examples.
Because all models simplify reality by stripping part of it away, they are abstractions. Critics
of economics often point to abstraction as a weakness. Most economists, however, see abstraction
as a real strength.

CHAPTER 1
The Scope and Method of Economics 11
Ockham’s razor
The
principle that irrelevant detail
should be cut away.
The easiest way to see how abstraction can be helpful is to think of a map. A map is a repre-
sentation of reality that is simplified and abstract. A city or state appears on a piece of paper as a
series of lines and colors. The amount of reality that the mapmaker can strip away before the map
loses something essential depends on what the map will be used for. If you want to drive from
St. Louis to Phoenix, you need to know only the major interstate highways and roads. You lose
absolutely nothing and gain clarity by cutting out the local streets and roads. However, if you
need to get around Phoenix, you may need to see every street and alley.
Most maps are two-dimensional representations of a three-dimensional world; they show
where roads and highways go but do not show hills and valleys along the way. Trail maps for hikers,
however, have“contour lines”that represent changes in elevation.When you are in a car, changes in
elevation matter very little; they would make a map needlessly complex and more difficult to read.
However, if you are on foot carrying a 50-pound pack, a knowledge of elevation is crucial.
Like maps, economic models are abstractions that strip away detail to expose only those
aspects of behavior that are important to the question being asked. The principle that irrelevant
detail should be cut away is called the principle of Ockham’s razor after the fourteenth-century
philosopher William of Ockham.
Be careful—although abstraction is a powerful tool for exposing and analyzing specific
aspects of behavior, it is possible to oversimplify. Economic models often strip away a good deal
of social and political reality to get at underlying concepts. When an economic theory is used to
help formulate actual government or institutional policy, political and social reality must often be
reintroduced if the policy is to have a chance of working.
The key here is that the appropriate amount of simplification and abstraction depends on
the use to which the model will be put. To return to the map example: You do not want to walk
around San Francisco with a map made for drivers—there are too many very steep hills.
All Else Equal: Ceteris Paribus
It is usually true that whatever you want to explain with a
model depends on more than one factor. Suppose, for example, that you want to explain the total
number of miles driven by automobile owners in the United States. The number of miles driven
will change from year to year or month to month; it is a variable. The issue, if we want to under-
stand and explain changes that occur, is what factors cause those changes.
Obviously, many things might affect total miles driven. First, more or fewer people may be
driving. This number, in turn, can be affected by changes in the driving age, by population
growth, or by changes in state laws. Other factors might include the price of gasoline, the house-
hold’s income, the number and age of children in the household, the distance from home to
work, the location of shopping facilities, and the availability and quality of public transport.
When any of these variables change, the members of the household may drive more or less. If
changes in any of these variables affect large numbers of households across the country, the total
number of miles driven will change.
Very often we need to isolate or separate these effects. For example, suppose we want to know
the impact on driving of a higher tax on gasoline. This change would raise the price of gasoline at
the pump but would not (at least in the short run) affect income, workplace location, number of
children, and so on.
To isolate the impact of one single factor, we use the device of ceteris paribus, or all else
equal. We ask, “What is the impact of a change in gasoline price on driving behavior, ceteris
paribus, or assuming that nothing else changes?” If gasoline prices rise by 10 percent, how much
less driving will there be, assuming no simultaneous change in anything else—that is, assuming
that income, number of children, population, laws, and so on, all remain constant? Using the
device of ceteris paribus is one part of the process of abstraction. In formulating economic theory,
the concept helps us simplify reality to focus on the relationships that interest us.
Expressing Models in Words, Graphs, and Equations
Consider the following
statements: Lower airline ticket prices cause people to fly more frequently. Higher interest rates
slow the rate of home sales. When firms produce more output, employment increases. Higher
gasoline prices cause people to drive less and to buy more fuel-efficient cars.

post hoc, ergo propter hoc
Literally, “after this (in time),
therefore because of this.” A
common error made in
thinking about causation: If
Event A happens before
Event B, it is not necessarily
true that A caused B.
Each of those statements expresses a relationship between two variables that can be quanti-
fied. In each case, there is a stimulus and a response, a cause and an effect. Quantitative relation-
ships can be expressed in a variety of ways. Sometimes words are sufficient to express the essence
of a theory, but often it is necessary to be more specific about the nature of a relationship or
about the size of a response. The most common method of expressing the quantitative relation-
ship between two variables is graphing that relationship on a two-dimensional plane. In fact, we
will use graphic analysis extensively in Chapter 2 and beyond. Because it is essential that you be
familiar with the basics of graphing, the appendix to this chapter presents a careful review of
graphing techniques.
Quantitative relationships between variables can also be presented through equations. For
example, suppose we discovered that over time, U.S. households collectively spend, or consume,
90 percent of their income and save 10 percent of their income. We could then write:
C = .90 Y and S = .10Y
where C is consumption spending, Y is income, and S is saving. Writing explicit algebraic expres-
sions like these helps us understand the nature of the underlying process of decision making.
Understanding this process is what economics is all about.
Cautions and Pitfalls
In formulating theories and models, it is especially important to
avoid two pitfalls: the post hoc fallacy and the fallacy of composition.
The Post Hoc Fallacy
Theories often make statements or sets of statements about cause and
effect. It can be quite tempting to look at two events that happen in sequence and assume that the
first caused the second to happen. This is not always the case. This common error is called the
post hoc, ergo propter hoc (or “after this, therefore because of this”) fallacy.
There are thousands of examples. The Colorado Rockies have won seven games in a row. Last
night you went to the game and they lost. You must have jinxed them. They lost because you went
to the game.
Stock market analysts indulge in what is perhaps the most striking example of the post hoc
fallacy in action. Every day the stock market goes up or down, and every day some analyst on
some national news program singles out one or two of the day’s events as the cause of some
change in the market: “Today the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5 points on heavy trading;
analysts say that the increase was due to progress in talks between Israel and Syria.” Research has
shown that daily changes in stock market averages are very largely random. Although major news
events clearly have a direct influence on certain stock prices, most daily changes cannot be linked
directly to specific news stories.
Very closely related to the post hoc fallacy is the often erroneous link between correlation
and causation. Two variables are said to be correlated if one variable changes when the other
variable changes. However, correlation does not imply causation. Cities that have high crime
rates also have many automobiles, so there is a very high degree of correlation between number
of cars and crime rates. Can we argue, then, that cars cause crime? No. The reason for the corre-
lation may have nothing to do with cause and effect. Big cities have many people, many people
have many cars; therefore, big cities have many cars. Big cities also have high crime rates for
many reasons—crowding, poverty, anonymity, unequal distribution of wealth, and readily avail-
able drugs, to mention only a few. However, the presence of cars is probably not one of them.
This caution must also be viewed in reverse. Sometimes events that seem entirely uncon-
nected actually are connected. In 1978, Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts ran for
reelection. Still quite popular, Dukakis was nevertheless defeated in the Democratic primary that
year by a razor-thin margin. The weekend before, the Boston Red Sox, in the thick of the division
championship race, had been badly beaten by the New York Yankees in four straight games. Some
very respectable political analysts believe that hundreds of thousands of Boston sports fans
vented their anger on the incumbent governor the following Tuesday.

CHAPTER 1
The Scope and Method of Economics 13
The Fallacy of Composition
To conclude that what is true for a part is necessarily true for
the whole is to fall into the fallacy of composition. Suppose that a large group of cattle ranchers
graze their cattle on the same range. To an individual rancher, more cattle and more grazing
mean a higher income. However, because its capacity is limited, the land can support only so
many cattle. If every cattle rancher increased the number of cattle sent out to graze, the land
would become overgrazed and barren; as a result, everyone’s income would fall. In short, theories
that seem to work well when applied to individuals or households often break down when they
are applied to the whole.
Testing Theories and Models: Empirical Economics
In science, a theory is
rejected when it fails to explain what is observed or when another theory better explains what is
observed. The collection and use of data to test economic theories is called empirical economics.
Numerous large data sets are available to facilitate economic research. For example, econ-
omists studying the labor market can now test behavioral theories against the actual working
experiences of thousands of randomly selected people who have been surveyed continuously
since the 1960s. Macroeconomists continuously monitoring and studying the behavior of the
national economy at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) pass thousands 
of items of data, collected by both government agencies and private companies, over 
the Internet.
In the natural sciences, controlled experiments, typically done in the lab, are a standard way
of testing theories. In recent years, economics has seen an increase in the use of experiments, both
in the field and in the lab, as a tool to test its theories. One economist, John List of Chicago, tested
the effect of changing the way an auction was run on bid prices for rare baseball cards with the
help of the sports memorabilia dealers in trade show. (The experiment used a standard Cal
Ripkin Jr. card.) Another economist, Keith Chen of Yale, has used experiments with monkeys to
investigate the deeper biological roots of human decision making. The Economics in Practice on
p. 9 describes another experiment on trust and gender.
Economic Policy
Economic theory helps us understand how the world works, but the formulation of economic
policy requires a second step. We must have objectives. What do we want to change? Why? What is
good and what is bad about the way the system is operating? Can we make it better?
Such questions force us to be specific about the grounds for judging one outcome superior
to another. What does it mean to be better? Four criteria are frequently applied in judging eco-
nomic outcomes:
1. Efficiency
2. Equity
3. Growth
4. Stability
Efficiency
In physics,“efficiency” refers to the ratio of useful energy delivered by a system to
the energy supplied to it. An efficient automobile engine, for example, is one that uses a small
amount of fuel per mile for a given level of power.
In economics, efficiency means allocative efficiency. An efficient economy is one that pro-
duces what people want at the least possible cost. If the system allocates resources to the produc-
tion of goods and services that nobody wants, it is inefficient. If all members of a particular
society were vegetarians and somehow half of all that society’s resources were used to produce
meat, the result would be inefficient. It is inefficient when steel beams lie in the rain and rust
because somebody fouled up a shipping schedule. If a firm could produce its product using
25 percent less labor and energy without sacrificing quality, it too is inefficient.
The clearest example of an efficient change is a voluntary exchange. If you and I each
want something that the other has and we agree to exchange, we are both better off and no

one loses. When a company reorganizes its production or adopts a new technology that
enables it to produce more of its product with fewer resources, without sacrificing quality, it
has made an efficient change. At least potentially, the resources saved could be used to pro-
duce more of something.
Inefficiencies can arise in numerous ways. Sometimes they are caused by government regula-
tions or tax laws that distort otherwise sound economic decisions. Suppose that land in Ohio is
best suited for corn production and that land in Kansas is best suited for wheat production. A law
that requires Kansas to produce only corn and Ohio to produce only wheat would be inefficient.
If firms that cause environmental damage are not held accountable for their actions, the incentive
to minimize those damages is lost and the result is inefficient.
Equity
While efficiency has a fairly precise definition that can be applied with some degree of
rigor, equity (fairness) lies in the eye of the beholder. To many, fairness implies a more equal dis-
tribution of income and wealth. Fairness may imply alleviating poverty, but the extent to which
the poor should receive cash benefits from the government is the subject of enormous disagree-
ment. For thousands of years, philosophers have wrestled with the principles of justice that
should guide social decisions. They will probably wrestle with such questions for thousands of
years to come.
Despite the impossibility of defining equity or fairness universally, public policy makers
judge the fairness of economic outcomes all the time. Rent control laws were passed because
some legislators thought that landlords treated low-income tenants unfairly. Certainly, most
social welfare programs are created in the name of equity.
Growth
As the result of technological change, the building of machinery, and the acqui-
sition of knowledge, societies learn to produce new goods and services and to produce old
ones better. In the early days of the U.S. economy, it took nearly half the population to pro-
duce the required food supply. Today less than 2.0 percent of the country’s population works
in agriculture.
When we devise new and better ways of producing the goods and services we use now and
when we develop new goods and services, the total amount of production in the economy
increases. Economic growth is an increase in the total output of an economy. If output grows
faster than the population, output per capita rises and standards of living increase.
Presumably, when an economy grows, it produces more of what people want. Rural and agrar-
ian societies become modern industrial societies as a result of economic growth and rising per
capita output.
Some policies discourage economic growth, and others encourage it. Tax laws, for example,
can be designed to encourage the development and application of new production techniques.
Research and development in some societies are subsidized by the government. Building roads,
highways, bridges, and transport systems in developing countries may speed up the process of
economic growth. If businesses and wealthy people invest their wealth outside their country
rather than in their country’s industries, growth in their home country may be slowed.
Stability
Economic stability refers to the condition in which national output is growing
steadily, with low inflation and full employment of resources. During the 1950s and 1960s, the
U.S. economy experienced a long period of relatively steady growth, stable prices, and low unem-
ployment. Between 1951 and 1969, consumer prices never rose more than 5 percent in a single
year, and in only 2 years did the number of unemployed exceed 6 percent of the labor force. From
the end of the Gulf War in 1991 to the beginning of 2001, the U.S. economy enjoyed price stabil-
ity and strong economic growth with rising employment. It was the longest expansion in
American history.
The decades of the 1970s and 1980s, however, were not as stable. The United States expe-
rienced two periods of rapid price inflation (over 10 percent) and two periods of severe

unemployment. In 1982, for example, 12 million people (10.8 percent of the workforce) were
looking for work. The beginning of the 1990s was another period of instability, with a reces-
sion occurring in 1990–1991. In 2008–2009 much of the world, including the United States,
experienced a large contraction in output and rise in unemployment. This was clearly an
unstable period.
The causes of instability and the ways in which governments have attempted to stabilize the
economy are the subject matter of macroeconomics.
An Invitation
This chapter has prepared you for your study of economics. The first part of the chapter invited
you into an exciting discipline that deals with important issues and questions. You cannot begin
to understand how a society functions without knowing something about its economic history
and its economic system.
The second part of the chapter introduced the method of reasoning that economics requires
and some of the tools that economics uses. We believe that learning to think in this very powerful
way will help you better understand the world.
As you proceed, it is important that you keep track of what you have learned in earlier
chapters. This book has a plan; it proceeds step-by-step, each section building on the last. It
would be a good idea to read each chapter’s table of contents at the start of each chapter and
scan each chapter before you read it to make sure you understand where it fits in the 
big picture.
CHAPTER 1
The Scope and Method of Economics 15
S U M M A R Y
1. Economics is the study of how individuals and societies
choose to use the scarce resources that nature and previous
generations have provided.
WHY STUDY ECONOMICS? p. 2
2. There are many reasons to study economics, including (a) to
learn a way of thinking, (b) to understand society, (c) to
understand global affairs, and (d) to be an informed citizen.
3. The best alternative that we forgo when we make a choice or
a decision is the opportunity cost of that decision.
THE SCOPE OF ECONOMICS p. 6
4. Microeconomics deals with the functioning of individual
markets and industries and with the behavior of individual
decision-making units: business firms and households.
5. Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It deals
with the economic behavior of aggregates—national output,
national income, the overall price level, and the general rate
of inflation.
6. Economics is a broad and diverse discipline with many spe-
cial fields of inquiry. These include economic history, inter-
national economics, and urban economics.
THE METHOD OF ECONOMICS p.9
7. Economics asks and attempts to answer two kinds of ques-
tions: positive and normative. Positive economics attempts
to understand behavior and the operation of economies
without making judgments about whether the outcomes
are good or bad. Normative economics looks at the results of
economic behavior and asks whether they are good or bad
and whether they can be improved.
8. Positive economics is often divided into two parts. Descriptive
economics involves the compilation of data that accurately
describe economic facts and events. Economic theory attempts
to generalize and explain what is observed. It involves state-
ments of cause and effect—of action and reaction.
9. An economic model is a formal statement of an economic
theory. Models simplify and abstract from reality.
10. It is often useful to isolate the effects of one variable on
another while holding “all else constant.” This is the device of
ceteris paribus.
11. Models and theories can be expressed in many ways. The
most common ways are in words, in graphs, and in equations.
12. Because one event happens before another, the second event
does not necessarily happen as a result of the first. To assume
that “after”implies “because”is to commit the fallacy of post
hoc, ergo propter hoc. The erroneous belief that what is true for a
part is necessarily true for the whole is the fallacy of composition.
13. Empirical economics involves the collection and use of data to
test economic theories. In principle, the best model is the
one that yields the most accurate predictions.
14. To make policy, one must be careful to specify criteria for
making judgments. Four specific criteria are used most often
in economics: efficiency, equity, growth, and stability.

1. One of the scarce resources that constrain our behavior is time.
Each of us has only 24 hours in a day. How do you go about allo-
cating your time in a given day among competing alternatives?
How do you go about weighing the alternatives? Once you choose
a most important use of time, why do you not spend all your time
on it? Use the notion of opportunity cost in your answer.
2. In the summer of 2007, the housing market and the mortgage
market were both in decline. Housing prices in most U.S. cities
began to decline in mid-2006. With prices falling and the
inventory of unsold houses rising, the production of new
homes fell to around 1.5 million in 2007 from 2.3 million in
2005. With new construction falling dramatically, it was
expected that construction employment would fall and that this
would have the potential of slowing the national economy and
increasing the general unemployment rate. Go to www.bls.gov
and check out the recent data on total employment and con-
struction employment. Have they gone up or down from their
levels in August 2007? What has happened to the unemploy-
ment rate? Go to www.fhfa.gov and look at the housing price
index. Have home prices risen or fallen since August 2007?
Finally, look at the latest GDP release at www.bea.gov. Look at
residential and nonresidential investment (Table 1.1.5) during
the last 2 years. Do you see a pattern? Does it explain the
employment numbers? Explain your answer.
3. Which of the following statements are examples of positive eco-
nomic analysis? Which are examples of normative analysis?
a. The inheritance tax should be repealed because it is unfair.
b. Allowing Chile to join NAFTA would cause wine prices in
the United States to drop.
c. The first priorities of the new regime in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC, formerly Zaire) should be to rebuild
schools and highways and to provide basic health care.
4. Sarita signed up with Netflix for a fixed fee of $16.99 per month.
For this fee, she can receive up to 3 DVDs at a time in the mail
and exchange each DVD as often as she likes. She also receives
unlimited instant access to movies being streamed from Netflix to
her computer or TV. During the average month in 2010, Sarita
received and watched 6 movies sent to her through the mail and
she watched an additional 13 movies which were streamed to her
computer. What is the average cost of a movie to Sarita? What is
the marginal cost of an additional movie?
5. A question facing many U.S. states is whether to allow casino
gambling. States with casino gambling have seen a substantial
increase in tax revenue flowing to state government. This revenue
can be used to finance schools, repair roads, maintain social
programs, or reduce other taxes.
a. Recall that efficiency means producing what people want at
the least cost. Can you make an efficiency argument in favor
of allowing casinos to operate?
b. What nonmonetary costs might be associated with gam-
bling? Would these costs have an impact on the efficiency
argument you presented in part a?
c. Using the concept of equity, argue for or against the legaliza-
tion of casino gambling.
6. For each of the following situations, identify the full cost
(opportunity cost) involved:
a. A worker earning an hourly wage of $8.50 decides to cut
back to part-time to attend Houston Community College.
b. Sue decides to drive to Los Angeles from San Francisco to
visit her son, who attends UCLA.
c. Tom decides to go to a wild fraternity party and stays out all
night before his physics exam.
d. Annie spends $200 on a new dress.
e. The Confab Company spends $1 million to build a new branch
plant that will probably be in operation for at least 10 years.
f. Alex’s father owns a small grocery store in town. Alex works
40 hours a week in the store but receives no compensation.
7. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 6] Log onto www.
census.gov. Click on “Foreign Trade,”then on “Statistics,”and
finally on “State Export Data.”There you will find a list of the
products produced in your state and exported to countries around
the world. In looking over that list, are you surprised by anything?
Do you know of any firms that produce these items? Search the
Web to find a company that does. Do some research and write a
paragraph about your company: what it produces, how many peo-
ple it employs, and whatever else you can learn about the firm.You
might even call the company to obtain the information.
8. Explain the pitfalls in the following statements.
a. Whenever Jeremy decides to wash his car, the next day it
usually rain. Since Jeremy’s town is suffering from a severe
drought, he decided to wash his car and, just as he expected,
the next day the thunderstorms rolled in. Obviously it rained
because Jeremy washed his car.

b. The principal of Hamilton High School found that requiring
those students who were failing algebra to attend an after-
school tutoring program resulted in a 30 percent average
increase in their algebra grades. Based on this success, the
principal decided to hire more tutors and require that all
students must attend after-school tutoring, so everyone’s
algebra grades would improve.
c. People who drive hybrid automobiles recycle their trash
more than people who do not drive hybrids. Therefore,
recycling trash causes people to drive hybrid automobiles.
9. Explain whether each of the following is an example of a macro-
economic concern or a microeconomic concern.
a. Ford Motor Company is contemplating increasing the pro-
duction of full-size SUVs based on projected future con-
sumer demand.
b. Congress is debating the option of implementing a value-
added tax as a means to cut the federal deficit.
c. The Federal Reserve announces it is increasing the discount
rate in an attempt to slow the rate of inflation.
d. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 22.5 percent
increase in the number or workers in the healthcare industry
from 2008 to 2018.
10. On the Forbes 2010 list of the World’s Billionaires, Mexico’s Carlos
Slim Helu ranks at the top with a net worth of U.S. $53.5 billion.
Does this “richest man in the world” face scarcity, or does scarcity
only affect those with more limited incomes and lower net worth?

CHAPTER 1 APPENDIX
How to Read and Understand
Graphs
Economics is the most quantitative of the social sciences. If you
flip through the pages of this or any other economics text, you
will see countless tables and graphs. These serve a number of
purposes. First, they illustrate important economic relation-
ships. Second, they make difficult problems easier to understand
and analyze. Finally, they can show patterns and regularities that
may not be discernible in simple lists of numbers.
A graph is a two-dimensional representation of a set of
numbers, or data. There are many ways that numbers can be
illustrated by a graph.
Time Series Graphs
It is often useful to see how a single measure or variable
changes over time. One way to present this information is to
plot the values of the variable on a graph, with each value cor-
responding to a different time period. A graph of this kind is
called a time series graph. On a time series graph, time is
measured along the horizontal scale and the variable being
graphed is measured along the vertical scale. Figure 1A.1 is a
time series graph that presents the total disposable personal

income in the U.S. economy for each year between 1975 and
2009.1 This graph is based on the data found in Table 1A.1. By
displaying these data graphically, we can see that (1) total dis-
posable personal income has increased steadily since 1975 and
(2) during certain periods, income has increased at a faster
rate than during other periods.
Graphing Two Variables on a Cartesian
Coordinate System
More important than simple graphs of one variable are graphs
that contain information on two variables at the same time.
The most common method of graphing two variables is the
Cartesian coordinate system. This system is constructed by
drawing two perpendicular lines: a horizontal line, or X-axis,
and a vertical line, or Y-axis. The axes contain measurement
scales that intersect at 0 (zero). This point is called the origin.
On the vertical scale, positive numbers lie above the horizontal
axis (that is, above the origin) and negative numbers lie below
it. On the horizontal scale, positive numbers lie to the right of
the vertical axis (to the right of the origin) and negative num-
bers lie to the left of it. The point at which the graph intersects
the Y-axis is called the Y-intercept. The point at which the
graph intersects the X-axis is called the X-intercept.
When two variables are plotted on a single graph, each point
represents a pair of numbers.The first number is measured on the
X-axis, and the second number is measured on the Y-axis. For
example, the following points (X,Y) are plotted on the set of axes

not all, of the graphs in this book are plots of two variables where

Plotting Income and Consumption Data
For Households
Table 1A.2 presents data collected by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS). In a recent survey, 5,000 households were
asked to keep track of all their expenditures. This table shows
average income and average spending for those households,

ranked by income. For example, the average income for the
top fifth (20 percent) of the households was $158,652. The
average spending for the top 20 percent was $97,003.
Figure 1A.3 presents the numbers from Table 1A.2
graphically using the Cartesian coordinate system. Along the
horizontal scale, the X-axis, we measure average income.
Along the vertical scale, the Y-axis, we measure average con-
sumption spending. Each of the five pairs of numbers from
the table is represented by a point on the graph. Because all
numbers are positive numbers, we need to show only the
upper right quadrant of the coordinate system.
To help you read this graph,we have drawn a dotted line con-
necting all the points where consumption and income would be
equal. This 45° line does not represent any data. Instead, it repre-
sents the line along which all variables on the X-axis correspond
exactly to the variables on the Y-axis, for example, (10,000,
10,000), (20,000, 20,000), and (37,000, 37,000). The heavy blue
line traces the data; the purpose of the dotted line is to help you
read the graph.
There are several things to look for when reading a graph.
The first thing you should notice is whether the line slopes
upward or downward as you move from left to right. The blue
line in Figure 1A.3 slopes upward, indicating that there seems
to be a positive relationship between income and spending:
The higher a household’s income, the more a household tends
to consume. If we had graphed the percentage of each group
receiving welfare payments along the Y-axis, the line would
presumably slope downward, indicating that welfare payments
are lower at higher income levels. The income level/welfare
payment relationship is thus a negative relationship.
Slope
The slope of a line or curve is a measure that indicates whether
the relationship between the variables is positive or negative
and how much of a response there is in Y (the variable on the
vertical axis) when X (the variable on the horizontal axis)
changes. The slope of a line between two points is the change
in the quantity measured on the Y-axis divided by the change
in the quantity measured on the X-axis. We will normally use
(the Greek letter delta) to refer to a change in a variable. In
Figure 1A.4, the slope of the line between points A and B is
divided by 
. Sometimes it is easy to remember slope as “the
rise over the run,” indicating the vertical change over the hori-
zontal change.
To be precise,
between two points on a graph is
simply X2 minus X1, where X2 is the X value for the second
point and X1 is the X value for the first point. Similarly,
is defined as Y2 minus Y1, where Y2 is the Y value for the sec-
ond point and Y1 is the Y value for the first point. Slope is
equal to
As we move from A to B in Figure 1A.4(a), both X and Y
increase; the slope is thus a positive number. However, as we
move from A to B in Figure 1A.4(b), X increases [(X2 - X1) is
a positive number], but Y decreases [(Y2 - Y1) is a negative
number]. The slope in Figure 1A.4(b) is thus a negative num-
ber because a negative number divided by a positive number
results in a negative quotient.
To calculate the numerical value of the slope between
points A and B in Figure 1A.3, we need to calculate 
and
. Because consumption is measured on the Y-axis,
is 9,447 [(Y2 - Y1) = (31,751 - 22,304)]. Because income is
measured along the X-axis,
is 17,179 [(X2 - X1) = (27,442
- 10,263)]. The slope between A and B is
= 9,447/17,179 = + 0.55.

A graph is a simple two-

tation of data. This graph displays
the data from Table 1A.2. Along
the horizontal scale (X-axis), we
measure household income. Along
the vertical scale (Y-axis), we mea-
sure household consumption.
Note: At point A, consumption
equals $22,304 and income
equals $10,263. At point B, con-
sumption equals $31,751 and
income equals $27,442.
Source: See Table 1A.2.

Another interesting thing to note about the data graphed
in Figure 1A.3 is that all the points lie roughly along a straight
line. (If you look very closely, however, you can see that the
slope declines as you move from left to right; the line becomes
slightly less steep.) A straight line has a constant slope. That is,
if you pick any two points along it and calculate the slope, you
will always get the same number. A horizontal line has a zero
slope (
is zero); a vertical line has an “infinite”slope because
is too big to be measured.
Unlike the slope of a straight line, the slope of a curve is
continually changing. Consider, for example, the curves in
Figure 1A.5. Figure 1A.5(a) shows a curve with a positive
slope that decreases as you move from left to right. The easi-
est way to think about the concept of increasing or decreasing

It is important to think carefully about what is represented by points in the space defined by the axes of a
graph. In this graph, we have graphed income with consumption, as in Figure 1A.3, but here each observa-
tion point is national income and aggregate consumption in different years, measured in billions of dollars.
Source: See Table 1A.3.
Some Precautions
When you read a graph, it is important to think carefully
about what the points in the space defined by the axes rep-
resent. Table 1A.3 and Figure 1A.6 present a graph of
consumption and income that is very different from the one
slope is to imagine what it is like walking up a hill from left
to right. If the hill is steep, as it is in the first part of
Figure 1A.5(a), you are moving more in the Y direction for
each step you take in the X direction. If the hill is less steep, as
it is further along in Figure 1A.5(a), you are moving less in
the Y direction for every step you take in the X direction.
Thus, when the hill is steep, slope (
) is a larger num-
ber than it is when the hill is flatter. The curve in
Figure 1A.5(b) has a positive slope, but its slope increases as
you move from left to right.
The same analogy holds for curves that have a negative
slope. Figure 1A.5(c) shows a curve with a negative slope
that increases (in absolute value) as you move from left to
right. This time think about skiing down a hill. At first, the
descent in Figure 1A.5(c) is gradual (low slope), but as you
proceed down the hill (to the right), you descend more
quickly (high slope). Figure 1A.5(d) shows a curve with a
negative slope that decreases (in absolute value) as you move
from left to right.
In Figure 1A.5(e), the slope goes from positive to negative
as X increases. In Figure 1A.5(f), the slope goes from
negative to positive. At point A in both, the slope is zero.
[Remember, slope is defined as 
. At point A, Y is not
changing (
= 0). Therefore, the slope at point A is zero.]

1. A graph is a two-dimensional representation of a set of num-
bers, or data. A time series graph illustrates how a single vari-
able changes over time.
2. The most common method of graphing two variables on
one graph is the Cartesian coordinate system, which includes
an X (horizontal)-axis and a Y (vertical)-axis. The points at
which the two axes intersect is called the origin. The point at
which a graph intersects the Y-axis is called the Y-intercept.
The point at which a graph intersects the X-axis is called the
X-intercept.
in Table 1A.2 and Figure 1A.3. First, each point in
Figure 1A.6 represents a different year; in Figure 1A.3, each
point represented a different group of households at the
same point in time (2008). Second, the points in Figure 1A.6
represent aggregate consumption and income for the whole
nation measured in billions of dollars; in Figure 1A.3, the
points represented average household income and consump-
tion measured in dollars.
It is interesting to compare these two graphs. All points on
the aggregate consumption curve in Figure 1A.6 lie below the
45° line, which means that aggregate consumption is always
less than aggregate income. However, the graph of average
household income and consumption in Figure 1A.3 crosses the
45° line, implying that for some households, consumption is
larger than income.
3. The slope of a line or curve indicates whether the relation-
ship between the two variables graphed on a Cartesian coor-
dinate system is positive or negative and how much of a
response there is in Y (the variable on the vertical axis) when
X (the variable on the horizontal axis) changes. The slope of
a line between two points is the change in the quantity mea-
sured on the Y-axis divided by the change in the quantity
measured on the X-axis.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

The Economic
Problem: Scarcity 
and Choice
Chapter 1 began with a very broad
definition of economics. Every
society, no matter how small or
large, no matter how simple or
complex, has a system or process
that works to transform the
resources that nature and previous
generations provide into useful
form. Economics is the study of
that process and its outcomes.
Figure 2.1 illustrates three
basic questions that must be
answered to understand the func-
tioning of the economic system:
 What gets produced?
 How is it produced?
 Who gets what is produced?
This chapter explores these questions in detail. In a sense, this entire chapter is the defini-
tion of economics. It lays out the central problems addressed by the discipline and presents a
framework that will guide you through the rest of the book. The starting point is the presump-
tion that human wants are unlimited but resources are not. Limited or scarce resources force indi-
viduals and societies to choose among competing uses of resources—alternative combinations
of produced goods and services—and among alternative final distributions of what is produced
among households.
These questions are positive or descriptive. That is, they ask how the system functions without
passing judgment about whether the result is good or bad. They must be answered first before we
ask more normative questions such as these:
 Is the outcome good or bad?
 Can it be improved?
The term resources is very broad. The sketch on the left side of Figure 2.1 shows several cate-
gories of resources. Some resources are the products of nature: land, wildlife, fertile soil, minerals,
timber, energy, and even the rain and wind. In addition, the resources available to an economy
include things such as buildings and equipment that have been produced in the past but are now
being used to produce other things. And perhaps the most important resource of a society is its
human workforce with people’s talents, skills, and knowledge.
Things that are produced and then used in the production of other goods and services are
called capital resources, or simply capital. Buildings, equipment, desks, chairs, software, roads,
bridges, and highways are a part of the nation’s stock of capital.
The basic resources available to a society are often referred to as factors of production,
or simply factors. The three key factors of production are land, labor, and capital. The
process that transforms scarce resources into useful goods and services is called production.
In many societies, most of the production of goods and services is done by private firms.

PART I
Introduction to Economics 
 FIGURE 2.1 The Three Basic Questions
Every society has some system or process that transforms its scarce resources into useful goods and services.
In doing so, it must decide what gets produced, how it is produced, and to whom it is distributed. The pri-
mary resources that must be allocated are land, labor, and capital.
Resources
Producers
The three basic questions:
Allocation of resources
Distribution of output
Mix of output
Households
1. What gets produced?
2. How is it produced?
3. Who gets what is produced?
Private airlines in the United States use land (runways), labor (pilots and mechanics), and cap-
ital (airplanes) to produce transportation services. But in all societies, some production is done
by the public sector, or government. Examples of government-produced or government-
provided goods and services include national defense, public education, police protection, and
fire protection.
Resources or factors of production are the inputs into the process of production; goods and
services of value to households are the outputs of the process of production.
Scarcity, Choice, and Opportunity Cost
In the second half of this chapter we discuss the global economic landscape. Before you can
understand the different types of economic systems, it is important to master the basic economic
concepts of scarcity, choice, and opportunity cost.
Scarcity and Choice in a One-Person Economy
The simplest economy is one in which a single person lives alone on an island. Consider Bill, the
survivor of a plane crash, who finds himself cast ashore in such a place. Here individual and soci-
ety are one; there is no distinction between social and private. Nonetheless, nearly all the same
basic decisions that characterize complex economies must also be made in a simple economy. That is,
although Bill will get whatever he produces, he still must decide how to allocate the island’s
resources, what to produce, and how and when to produce it.
First, Bill must decide what he wants to produce. Notice that the word needs does not appear
here. Needs are absolute requirements; but beyond just enough water, basic nutrition, and shelter
to survive, needs are very difficult to define. What is an “absolute necessity” for one person may
not be for another person. In any case, Bill must put his wants in some order of priority and make
some choices.
Next, he must look at the possibilities. What can he do to satisfy his wants given the limits of
the island? In every society, no matter how simple or complex, people are constrained in what
they can do. In this society of one, Bill is constrained by time, his physical condition, his knowl-
edge, his skills, and the resources and climate of the island.
Given that resources are limited, Bill must decide how to best use them to satisfy his hierar-
chy of wants. Food would probably come close to the top of his list. Should he spend his time
gathering fruits and berries? Should he hunt for game? Should he clear a field and plant seeds?
inputs or resources
Anything provided by nature or
previous generations that can
be used directly or indirectly to
satisfy human wants.
outputs
Goods and services
of value to households.

CHAPTER 2
The Economic Problem: Scarcity and Choice 27
The answers to those questions depend on the character of the island, its climate, its flora and
fauna (are there any fruits and berries?), the extent of his skills and knowledge (does he know
anything about farming?), and his preferences (he may be a vegetarian).
Opportunity Cost
The concepts of constrained choice and scarcity are central to the disci-
pline of economics. They can be applied when discussing the behavior of individuals such as Bill
and when analyzing the behavior of large groups of people in complex societies.
Given the scarcity of time and resources, if Bill decides to hunt, he will have less time to
gather fruits and berries. He faces a trade-off between meat and fruit. There is a trade-off
between food and shelter too. If Bill likes to be comfortable, he may work on building a nice
place to live, but that may require giving up the food he might have produced. As we noted in
Chapter 1, the best alternative that we give up, or forgo, when we make a choice is the
opportunity cost of that choice.
Bill may occasionally decide to rest, to lie on the beach, and to enjoy the sun. In one sense,
that benefit is free—he does not have to buy a ticket to lie on the beach. In reality, however, relax-
ing does have an opportunity cost. The true cost of that leisure is the value of the other things Bill
could have produced, but did not, during the time he spent on the beach.
During 2010, more than a dozen cities, including Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Houston,
were actively considering public funding for new football, soccer, and basketball arenas. An
important part of that debate was the opportunity cost of the taxpayers’ dollars: What else could
tax dollars be spent on, and how much value would the alternatives  bring to the local taxpayers?
Perhaps without the new arena, taxes could be lower. Here the opportunity cost would include
the value taxpayers receive from goods and services they would consume with the earnings that
are no longer taxed. Most discussions of public expenditures at all levels of government include
active considerations of opportunity costs.
In making everyday decisions, it is often helpful to think about opportunity costs. Should you
go to the dorm party or not? First, it costs $4 to attend. When you pay money for anything, you
give up the other things you could have bought with that money. Second, it costs 2 or 3 hours.
Time is a valuable commodity for a college student. You have exams next week, and you need to
study.You could go to a movie instead of the party.You could go to another party.You could sleep.
Just as Bill must weigh the value of sunning on the beach against more food or better housing, so
you must weigh the value of the fun you may have at the party against everything else you might
otherwise do with the time and money.
Scarcity and Choice in an Economy of Two or More
Now suppose that another survivor of the crash, Colleen, appears on the island. Now that Bill
is not alone, things are more complex and some new decisions must be made. Bill’s and
Colleen’s preferences about what things to produce are likely to be different. They will proba-
bly not have the same knowledge or skills. Perhaps Colleen is very good at tracking animals and
Bill has a knack for building things. How should they split the work that needs to be done?
Once things are produced, the two castaways must decide how to divide them. How should
their products be distributed?
The mechanism for answering these fundamental questions is clear when Bill is alone on
the island. The “central plan” is his; he simply decides what he wants and what to do about it.
The minute someone else appears, however, a number of decision-making arrangements
immediately become possible. One or the other may take charge, in which case that person
will decide for both of them. The two may agree to cooperate, with each having an equal say,
and come up with a joint plan; or they may agree to split the planning as well as the produc-
tion duties. Finally, they may go off to live alone at opposite ends of the island. Even if they
live apart, however, they may take advantage of each other’s presence by specializing 
and trading.
Modern industrial societies must answer the same questions that Colleen and Bill must
answer, but the mechanics of larger economies are more complex. Instead of two people living
together, the United States has over 300 million people. Still, decisions must be made about what
to produce, how to produce it, and who gets it.
opportunity cost
The best
alternative that we give up, or
forgo, when we make a choice
or decision.

Introduction to Economics 
absolute advantage
A producer has an absolute
advantage over another in the
production of a good or
service if he or she can produce
that product using fewer
resources.
Specialization, Exchange, and Comparative Advantage
The idea that mem-
bers of society benefit by specializing in what they do best has a long history and is one of the
most important and powerful ideas in all of economics. David Ricardo, a major nineteenth-
century British economist, formalized the point precisely. According to Ricardo’s theory of
comparative advantage, specialization and free trade will benefit all trading parties, even
when some are “absolutely” more efficient producers than others. Ricardo’s basic point applies
just as much to Colleen and Bill as it does to different nations.
To keep things simple, suppose that Colleen and Bill have only two tasks to accomplish each
week: gathering food to eat and cutting logs to burn. If Colleen could cut more logs than Bill in
1 day and Bill could gather more nuts and berries than Colleen could, specialization would clearly
lead to more total production. Both would benefit if Colleen only cuts logs and Bill only gathers
nuts and berries, as long as they can trade.
Suppose that Bill is slow and somewhat clumsy in his nut gathering and that Colleen is bet-
ter at cutting logs and gathering food. At first, it might seem that since Colleen is better at every-
thing, she should do everything. But that cannot be right. Colleen’s time is limited after all, and
even though Bill is clumsy and not very clever, he must be able to contribute something.
One of Ricardo’s lasting contributions to economics has been his analysis of exactly this sit-
uation. His analysis, which is illustrated in Figure 2.2, shows both how Colleen and Bill should
divide the work of the island and how much they will gain from specializing and exchanging even
if, as in this example, one party is absolutely better at everything than the other party.
Suppose Colleen can cut 10 logs per day and Bill can cut only 4. Also suppose Colleen can
gather 10 bushels of food per day and Bill can gather only 8. A producer has an absolute
advantage over another in the production of a good or service if he or she can produce the
good or service using fewer resources, including time. Since Colleen can cut more logs per day
than Bill, we say that she has an absolute advantage in the production of logs. Similarly, Colleen
has an absolute advantage over Bill in the production of food.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Frozen Foods and Opportunity Costs
In 2007, $27 billion of frozen foods were sold in U.S. grocery
stores, one quarter of it in the form of frozen dinners and entrees.
In the mid-1950s, sales of frozen foods amounted to only $1 bil-
lion, a tiny fraction of the overall grocery store sales. One industry
observer attributes this growth to the fact that frozen food tastes
much better than it did in the past. Can you think of anything else
that might be occurring?
The growth of the frozen dinner entrée market in the last 50 years
is a good example of the role of opportunity costs in our lives. One of
the most significant social changes in the U.S. economy in this period
has been the increased participation of women in the labor force. In
1950, only 24 percent of married women worked; by 2000, that frac-
tion had risen to 61 percent. Producing a meal takes two basic ingre-
dients: food and time. When both husbands and wives work, the
opportunity cost of time for housework—including making meals—
goes up. This tells us that making a home-cooked meal became more
expensive in the last 50 years.A natural result is to shift people toward
labor-saving ways to make meals. Frozen foods are an obvious solu-
tion to the problem of increased opportunity costs.
Another, somewhat more subtle, opportunity cost story is at work
encouraging the consumption of frozen foods. In 1960, the first
microwave oven was introduced. The spread of this device into
America’s kitchens was rapid. The microwave turned out to be a quick
way to defrost and cook those frozen entrées. So this technology low-
ered the opportunity cost of making frozen dinners, reinforcing the
advantage these meals
had over home-cooked
meals.
Microwaves
made cooking with
frozen foods cheaper
once opportunity cost
was considered while
home-cooked 
meals
were becoming more
expensive.
The entrepreneurs among you also might recognize that the rise
we described in the opportunity cost of the home-cooked meal
contributed in part to the spread of the microwave, creating a rein-
forcing cycle. In fact, many entrepreneurs find that the simple tools of
economics—like the idea of opportunity costs—help them anticipate
what products will be profitable for them to produce in the future.
The growth of the two-worker family has stimulated many entrepre-
neurs to search for labor-saving solutions to family tasks.
The public policy students among you might be interested to
know that some researchers attribute part of the growth in obesity in
the United States to the lower opportunity costs of making meals
associated with the growth of the markets for frozen foods and the
microwave. (See David M.Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser, and Jesse M.
Shapiro, ”Why Have Americans Become More Obese?” Journal of
Economic Perspectives, Summer 2003, 93–118.)
theory of comparative
advantage
Ricardo’s theory
that specialization and free
trade will benefit all trading
parties, even those that may be
“absolutely” more efficient
producers.

CHAPTER 2    The Economic Problem: Scarcity and Choice 29
Thinking just about productivity and the output of food and logs, you might conclude that
it would benefit Colleen to move to the other side of the island and be by herself. Since she is
more productive in cutting logs and gathering food, would she not be better off on her own? How
could she benefit by hanging out with Bill and sharing what they produce?
To answer that question we must remember that Colleen’s time is limited: This limit creates
opportunity cost. A producer has a comparative advantage over another in the production of
a good or service if he or she can produce the good or service at a lower opportunity cost. First,
think about Bill. He can produce 8 bushels of food per day, or he can cut 4 logs. To get 8 addi-
tional bushels of food, he must give up cutting 4 logs. Thus, for Bill, the opportunity cost of
8 bushels of food is 4 logs. Think next about Colleen. She can produce 10 bushels of food per day,
or she can cut 10 logs. She thus gives up 1 log for each additional bushel; so for Colleen, the
opportunity cost of 8 bushels of food is 8 logs. Bill has a comparative advantage over Colleen in the
production of food because he gives up only 4 logs for an additional 8 bushels, whereas Colleen
gives up 8 logs.
Think now about what Colleen must give up in terms of food to get 10 logs. To produce
10 logs she must work a whole day. If she spends a day cutting 10 logs, she gives up a day of gath-
ering 10 bushels of food. Thus, for Colleen, the opportunity cost of 10 logs is 10 bushels of food.What
must Bill give up to get 10 logs? To produce 4 logs, he must work 1 day. For each day he cuts logs,
he gives up 8 bushels of food. He thus gives up 2 bushels of food for each log; so for Bill, the
opportunity cost of 10 logs is 20 bushels of food. Colleen has a comparative advantage over Bill in the
production of logs since she gives up only 10 bushels of food for an additional 10 logs, whereas
Bill gives up 20 bushels.
Ricardo argues that two parties can benefit from specialization and trade even if one party
has an absolute advantage in the production of both goods. Suppose Colleen and Bill both want

Introduction to Economics 
A Graphical Presentation of Comparative Advantage and Gains from Trade
Graphs
can also be used to show the benefits from specialization and trade in the example of Colleen
and Bill. To construct a graph reflecting Colleen’s production choices (Figure 2.3 [a]), we start
with the end points. If she were to devote an entire month (30 days) to log production,
she could cut 300 logs—10 logs per day  30 days. Similarly, if she were to devote an entire
month to food gathering, she could produce 300 bushels. If she chose to split her time evenly
(15 days to logs and 15 days to food), she would have 150 bushels and 150 logs. Her produc-
tion possibilities are illustrated by the straight line between A and B and illustrate the trade-
off that she faces between logs and food: By reducing her time spent in food gathering,
Colleen is able to devote more time to logs; and for every 10 bushels of food that she gives up,
she gets 10 logs.
In Figure 2.3(b), we construct a graph of Bill’s production possibilities. Recall that Bill
can produce 8 bushels of food per day, but he can cut only 4 logs. Again, starting with the
end points, if Bill devoted all his time to food production, he could produce 240 bushels—
8 bushels of food per day  30 days. Similarly, if he were to devote the entire 30 days to log
cutting, he could cut 120 logs—4 logs per day  30 days. By splitting his time, with 20 days
spent on log cutting and 10 days spent gathering food, Bill could produce 80 logs and
80 bushels of food. His production possibilities are illustrated by the straight line between
D and E. By shifting his resources and time from logs to food, he gets 2 bushels for every log.
Figures 2.3(a) and 2.3(b) illustrate the maximum amounts of food and logs that Bill and
Colleen can produce acting independently with no specialization or trade, which is 230 logs and
230 bushels. Now let us have each specialize in producing the good in which he or she has a com-
parative advantage. Back in Figure 2.2 on p. 29, we showed that if Bill devoted all his time to food
production, producing 240 bushels (30 days  8 bushels per day), and Colleen devoted the vast
majority of her time to cutting logs (27 days) and just a few days to gathering food (3 days), their
combined total would be 270 logs and 270 bushels of food. Colleen would produce 270 logs and
30 bushels of food to go with Bill’s 240 bushels of food.
Finally, we arrange a trade, and the result is shown in Figures 2.4(a) and 2.4(b). Bill trades
140 bushels of food to Colleen for 100 logs, and he ends up with 100 logs and 100 bushels of food,
20 more of each than he would have had before the specialization and trade.
equal numbers of logs and bushels of food. If Colleen goes off on her own, in a 30-day month she
can produce 150 logs and 150 bushels, devoting 15 days to each task. For Bill to produce equal
numbers of logs and bushels on his own requires that he spend 10 days on food and 20 days on
logs. This yields 80 bushels of food (10 days  8 bushels per day) and 80 logs (20 days  4 logs
per day). Between the two, they produce 230 logs and 230 bushels of food.
Let’s see if specialization and trade can work. If Bill spends all his time on food, he pro-
duces 240 bushels in a month (30 days  8 bushels per day). If Colleen spends 3 days on food
and 27 days on logs, she produces 30 bushels of food (3 days  10 bushels per day) and
270 logs (27 days  10 logs per day). Between the two, they produce 270 logs and 270 bushels
of food, which is more than the 230 logs and 230 bushels they produced when not specializ-
ing. Thus, by specializing in the production of the good in which they enjoyed a comparative
advantage, there are more of both goods. We see in this example how the fundamental
concept of opportunity cost covered earlier in this chapter relates to the theory of compara-
tive advantage.
Even if Colleen were to live at another place on the island, she could specialize, producing
30 bushels of food and 270 logs, then trading 100 of her logs to Bill for 140 bushels of food. This
would leave her with 170 logs and 170 bushels of food, which is more than the 150 of each she
could produce on her own. Bill would specialize completely in food, producing 240 bushels.
Trading 140 bushels of food to Colleen for 100 logs leaves him with 100 of each, which is more
than the 80 of each he could produce on his own.
The simple example of Bill and Colleen should begin to give you some insight into why
most economists see value in free trade. Even if one country is absolutely better than another
country at producing everything, our example has shown that there are gains to specializing
and trading.

By specializing and engaging in trade, Colleen and Bill can move beyond their own production possibilities.
If Bill spends all his time producing food, he will produce 240 bushels of food and no logs. If he can trade
140 of his bushels of food to Colleen for 100 logs, he will end up with 100 logs and 100 bushels of food.
The figure in (b) shows that he can move from point F to point F'.
If Colleen spends 27 days cutting logs and 3 days producing food, she will produce 270 logs and 30 bushels
of food. If she can trade 100 of her logs to Bill for 140 bushels of food, she will end up with 170 logs and
170 bushels of food. The figure in (a) shows that she can move from point C to point C'.
Colleen ends up with 170 logs and 170 bushels, again 20 more of each than she would have
had before the specialization and trade. Both are better off. Both move beyond their individual
production possibilities.
Weighing Present and Expected Future Costs and Benefits
Very often we find
ourselves weighing benefits available today against benefits available tomorrow. Here, too, the
notion of opportunity cost is helpful.

32
PART I
Introduction to Economics 
While alone on the island, Bill had to choose between cultivating a field and just gathering
wild nuts and berries. Gathering nuts and berries provides food now; gathering seeds and clear-
ing a field for planting will yield food tomorrow if all goes well. Using today’s time to farm may
well be worth the effort if doing so will yield more food than Bill would otherwise have in the
future. By planting, Bill is trading present value for future value.
The simplest example of trading present for future benefits is the act of saving.When you put
income aside today for use in the future, you give up some things that you could have had today in
exchange for something tomorrow. Because nothing is certain, some judgment about future
events and expected values must be made. What will your income be in 10 years? How long are
you likely to live?
We trade off present and future benefits in small ways all the time. If you decide to study
instead of going to the dorm party, you are trading present fun for the expected future benefits of
higher grades. If you decide to go outside on a very cold day and run 5 miles, you are trading dis-
comfort in the present for being in better shape later.
Capital Goods and Consumer Goods
A society trades present for expected future
benefits when it devotes a portion of its resources to research and development or to invest-
ment in capital. As we said earlier in this chapter, capital in its broadest definition is anything
that has already been produced that will be used to produce other valuable goods or services
over time.
Building capital means trading present benefits for future ones. Bill and Colleen might trade
gathering berries or lying in the sun for cutting logs to build a nicer house in the future. In a
modern society, resources used to produce capital goods could have been used to produce
consumer goods—that is, goods for present consumption. Heavy industrial machinery does not
directly satisfy the wants of anyone, but producing it requires resources that could instead have
gone into producing things that do satisfy wants directly—for example, food, clothing, toys, or
golf clubs.
Capital is everywhere. A road is capital. Once a road is built, we can drive on it or transport
goods and services over it for many years to come. A house is also capital. Before a new manufac-
turing firm can start up, it must put some capital in place. The buildings, equipment, and inven-
tories that it uses comprise its capital. As it contributes to the production process, this capital
yields valuable services over time.
In Chapter 1, we talked about the enormous amount of capital—buildings, factories, housing,
cars, trucks, telephone lines, and so on—that you might see from a window high in a skyscraper.
Much of that capital was put in place by previous generations, yet it continues to provide valuable
services today; it is part of this generation’s endowment of resources. To build every building, every
road, every factory, every house, and every car or truck, society must forgo using resources to pro-
duce consumer goods today. To get an education, you pay tuition and put off joining the workforce
for a while.
Capital does not need to be tangible. When you spend time and resources developing skills or
getting an education, you are investing in human capital—your own human capital. This capital
will continue to exist and yield benefits to you for years to come. A computer program produced
by a software company and available online may cost nothing to distribute, but its true intangible
value comes from the ideas embodied in the program itself. It too is capital.
The process of using resources to produce new capital is called investment. (In everyday lan-
guage, the term investment often refers to the act of buying a share of stock or a bond, as in “I
invested in some Treasury bonds.” In economics, however, investment always refers to the cre-
ation of capital: the purchase or putting in place of buildings, equipment, roads, houses, and the
like.) A wise investment in capital is one that yields future benefits that are more valuable than
the present cost. When you spend money for a house, for example, presumably you value its
future benefits. That is, you expect to gain more from living in it than you would from the things
you could buy today with the same money. Capital can also be intangible. Consider education
that builds skills or knowledge in workers. Clearly education can yield decades of future “bene-
fits” including higher wages. Because resources are scarce, the opportunity cost of every invest-
ment in capital is forgone present consumption.

The ppf illustrates a number of economic concepts. One of the most important is opportunity cost. The opportu-
nity cost of producing more capital goods is fewer consumer goods. Moving from E to F, the number of capi-
tal goods increases from 550 to 800, but the number of consumer goods decreases from 1,300 to 1,100.
The Production Possibility Frontier
A simple graphic device called the production possibility frontier (ppf) illustrates the princi-
ples of constrained choice, opportunity cost, and scarcity. The ppf is a graph that shows all the
combinations of goods and services that can be produced if all of a society’s resources are used
efficiently. Figure 2.5 shows a ppf for a hypothetical economy.
On the Y-axis, we measure the quantity of capital goods produced. On the X-axis, we mea-
sure the quantity of consumer goods. All points below and to the left of the curve (the shaded
area) represent combinations of capital and consumer goods that are possible for the society
given the resources available and existing technology. Points above and to the right of the curve,
such as point G, represent combinations that cannot be reached. If an economy were to end up
at point A on the graph, it would be producing no consumer goods at all; all resources would be
used for the production of capital. If an economy were to end up at point B, it would be devot-
ing all its resources to the production of consumer goods and none of its resources to the forma-
tion of capital.
While all economies produce some of each kind of good, different economies emphasize dif-
ferent things. About 17.1 percent of gross output in the United States in 2005 was new capital. In
Japan, capital historically accounted for a much higher percent of gross output, while in the
Congo, the figure was 7 percent. Japan is closer to point A on its ppf, the Congo is closer to B, and
the United States is somewhere in between.
Points that are actually on the ppf are points of both full resource employment and pro-
duction efficiency. (Recall from Chapter 1 that an efficient economy is one that produces the
things that people want at the least cost. Production efficiency is a state in which a given mix
of outputs is produced at the least cost.) Resources are not going unused, and there is no
waste. Points that lie within the shaded area but that are not on the frontier represent either
unemployment of resources or production inefficiency. An economy producing at point D in
Figure 2.5 can produce more capital goods and more consumer goods, for example, by mov-
ing to point E. This is possible because resources are not fully employed at point D or are not
being used efficiently.

Inefficiency from
Misallocation of Land 
in Farming
Society can end up inside its ppf
at a point such as A by using its
resources inefficiently. If, for
example, Ohio’s climate and soil
were best suited for corn produc-
tion and those of Kansas were
best suited for wheat produc-
tion, a law forcing Kansas farm-
ers to produce corn and Ohio
farmers to produce wheat would
result in less of both. In such a
case, society might be at point A
instead of point B.
Unemployment
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the U.S. economy experienced
prolonged unemployment. Millions of workers found themselves without jobs. In 1933, 25 per-
cent of the civilian labor force was unemployed. This figure stayed above 14 percent until 1940.
More recently, between the end of 2007 and 2010, the United States lost over 8 million payroll
jobs and unemployment rose to over 15 million.
In addition to the hardship that falls on the unemployed, unemployment of labor means
unemployment of capital. During economic downturns or recessions, industrial plants run at less
than their total capacity. When there is unemployment of labor and capital, we are not producing
all that we can.
Periods of unemployment correspond to points inside the ppf, points such as D in Figure 2.5.
Moving onto the frontier from a point such as D means achieving full employment of resources.
Inefficiency
Although an economy may be operating with full employment of its land, labor,
and capital resources, it may still be operating inside its ppf (at a point such as D in Figure 2.5). It
could be using those resources inefficiently.
Waste and mismanagement are the results of a firm operating below its potential. If you are
the owner of a bakery and you forget to order flour, your workers and ovens stand idle while you
figure out what to do.
Sometimes inefficiency results from mismanagement of the economy instead of misman-
agement of individual private firms. Suppose, for example, that the land and climate in Ohio are
best suited for corn production and that the land and climate in Kansas are best suited for wheat
production. If Congress passes a law forcing Ohio farmers to plant 50 percent of their acreage
with wheat and Kansas farmers to plant 50 percent with corn, neither corn nor wheat production
will be up to potential. The economy will be at a point such as A in Figure 2.6—inside the ppf.
Allowing each state to specialize in producing the crop that it produces best increases the pro-
duction of both crops and moves the economy to a point such as B in Figure 2.6.
The Efficient Mix of Output
To be efficient, an economy must produce what people
want. This means that in addition to operating on the ppf, the economy must be operating at the
right point on the ppf. This is referred to as output efficiency, in contrast to production efficiency.
Suppose that an economy devotes 100 percent of its resources to beef production and that the
beef industry runs efficiently using the most modern techniques. Also suppose that everyone in
the society is a vegetarian. The result is a total waste of resources (assuming that the society can-
not trade its beef for vegetables produced in another country).
Points B and C in Figure 2.6 are points of production efficiency and full employment.
Whether B is more or less efficient than C, however, depends on the preferences of members of
society and is not shown in the ppf graph.

Wheat Production in
Ohio and Kansas
The ppf illustrates that the
opportunity cost of corn produc-
tion increases as we shift
resources from wheat produc-
tion to corn production. Moving
from point E to D, we get an
additional 100 million bushels of
corn at a cost of 50 million
bushels of wheat. Moving
from point B to A, we get only
50 million bushels of corn at a
cost of 100 million bushels of
wheat. The cost per bushel of
corn—measured in lost wheat—
has increased.
Negative Slope and Opportunity Cost
As we have seen, points that lie on the ppf rep-
resent points of full resource employment and production efficiency. Society can choose only one
point on the curve. Because a society’s choices are constrained by available resources and existing
technology, when those resources are fully and efficiently employed, it can produce more capital
goods only by reducing production of consumer goods. The opportunity cost of the additional
capital is the forgone production of consumer goods.
The fact that scarcity exists is illustrated by the negative slope of the ppf. (If you need a
review of slope, see the Appendix to Chapter 1.) In moving from point E to point F in Figure 2.5,
capital production increases by 800 - 550 = 250 units (a positive change), but that increase in
capital can be achieved only by shifting resources out of the production of consumer goods.
Thus, in moving from point E to point F in Figure 2.5, consumer goods production decreases by
1,300 - 1,100 = 200 units (a negative change). The slope of the curve, the ratio of the change in
capital goods to the change in consumer goods, is negative.
The value of the slope of a society’s ppf is called the marginal rate of transformation
(MRT). In Figure 2.5, the MRT between points E and F is simply the ratio of the change in capi-
tal goods (a positive number) to the change in consumer goods (a negative number).
The Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost
The negative slope of the ppf indicates the
trade-off that a society faces between two goods. We can learn something further about the shape
of the frontier and the terms of this trade-off. Let’s look at the trade-off between corn and wheat
production in Ohio and Kansas. In a recent year, Ohio and Kansas together produced 510 million
bushels of corn and 380 million bushels of wheat. Table 2.1 presents these two numbers, plus
some hypothetical combinations of corn and wheat production that might exist for Ohio and
Kansas together. Figure 2.7 graphs the data from Table 2.1.

PART I
Introduction to Economics 
Suppose that society’s demand for corn dramatically increases. If this happens, farmers
would probably shift some of their acreage from wheat production to corn production. Such a
shift is represented by a move from point C (where corn = 510 and wheat = 380) up and to the
left along the ppf toward points A and B in Figure 2.7. As this happens, it becomes more difficult
to produce additional corn. The best land for corn production was presumably already in corn,
and the best land for wheat production was already in wheat. As we try to produce more corn, the
land is less well suited to that crop. As we take more land out of wheat production, we are taking
increasingly better wheat-producing land. In other words, the opportunity cost of more corn,
measured in terms of wheat, increases.
Moving from point E to D, Table 2.1 shows that we can get 100 million bushels of corn
(400 - 300) by sacrificing only 50 million bushels of wheat (550 - 500)—that is, we get
2 bushels of corn for every bushel of wheat. However, when we are already stretching the ability
of the land to produce corn, it becomes harder to produce more and the opportunity cost
increases. Moving from point B to A, we can get only 50 million bushels of corn (700 - 650) by
sacrificing 100 million bushels of wheat (200 - 100). For every bushel of wheat, we now get only
half a bushel of corn. However, if the demand for wheat were to increase substantially and we
were to move down and to the right along the ppf, it would become increasingly difficult to pro-
duce wheat and the opportunity cost of wheat, in terms of corn, would increase. This is the law
of increasing opportunity cost.
If you think about the example we discussed earlier of Colleen and Bill producing logs and
food on an island, you will recognize that the production possibilities described were highly
simplified. In that example, we drew a downward slope, straight line ppf; to make the problem
easier, we assumed constant opportunity costs. In a real economy, ppf’s would be expected to
look like Figure 2.5.
Although it exists only as an abstraction, the ppf illustrates a number of very important
concepts that we will use throughout the rest of this book: scarcity, unemployment, inefficiency,
opportunity cost, the law of increasing opportunity cost, economic growth, and the gains
from trade.
It is important to remember that the ppf represents choices available within the constraints
imposed by the current state of agricultural technology. In the long run, technology may
improve, and when that happens, we have growth.
Economic Growth
Economic growth is characterized by an increase in the total output of
an economy. It occurs when a society acquires new resources or learns to produce more with
existing resources. New resources may mean a larger labor force or an increased capital stock. The
production and use of new machinery and equipment (capital) increase workers’ productivity.
(Give a man a shovel, and he can dig a bigger hole; give him a steam shovel, and wow!) Improved
productivity also comes from technological change and innovation, the discovery and application
of new, more efficient production techniques.
In the past few decades, the productivity of U.S. agriculture has increased dramatically. Based
on data compiled by the Department of Agriculture, Table 2.2 shows that yield per acre in corn
production has increased fivefold since the late 1930s, while the labor required to produce it has
dropped significantly. Productivity in wheat production has also increased, at only a slightly less
remarkable rate: Output per acre has more than tripled, while labor requirements are down
nearly 90 percent. These increases are the result of more efficient farming techniques, more and
better capital (tractors, combines, and other equipment), and advances in scientific knowledge
and technological change (hybrid seeds, fertilizers, and so on). As you can see in Figure 2.8,
increases such as these shift the ppf up and to the right.
Sources of Growth and the Dilemma of Poor Countries
Economic growth
arises from many sources, the two most important over the years having been the accumulation
of capital and technological advances. For poor countries, capital is essential; they must build the
communication networks and transportation systems necessary to develop industries that func-
tion efficiently. They also need capital goods to develop their agricultural sectors.
Recall that capital goods are produced only at a sacrifice of consumer goods. The same can
be said for technological advances. Technological advances come from research and develop-
ment that use resources; thus, they too must be paid for. The resources used to produce capital
economic growth
An
increase in the total output of
an economy. It occurs when a
society acquires new resources
or when it learns to produce
more using existing resources.

Growth Shifts the PPF
Up and to the Right
Productivity increases have
enhanced the ability of the
United States to produce both
corn and wheat. As Table 2.2
shows, productivity increases
were more dramatic for corn
than for wheat. Thus, the shifts
in the ppf were not parallel.
Note: The ppf also shifts if the
amount of land or labor in corn and
wheat production changes. Although
we emphasize productivity increases
here, the actual shifts between years
were due in part to land and labor
changes.
goods—to build a road, a tractor, or a manufacturing plant—and to develop new technologies
could have been used to produce consumer goods.
When a large part of a country’s population is very poor, taking resources out of the produc-
tion of consumer goods (such as food and clothing) is very difficult. In addition, in some coun-
tries, people wealthy enough to invest in domestic industries choose instead to invest abroad
because of political turmoil at home. As a result, it often falls to the governments of poor coun-
tries to generate revenues for capital production and research out of tax collections.

PART I
Introduction to Economics 
All these factors have contributed to the growing gap between some poor and rich
nations. Figure 2.9 shows the result using ppf’s. On the left, the rich country devotes a larger
portion of its production to capital while the poor country produces mostly consumer
goods. On the right, you see the results: The ppf of the rich country shifts up and out farther
and faster.
The importance of capital goods and technological developments to the position of work-
ers in less developed countries is well illustrated by Robert Jensen’s study of South India’s
industry. Conventional telephones require huge investments in wires and towers and, as a
result, many less developed areas are without landlines. Mobile phones, on the other hand,
require a less expensive investment; thus, in many areas, people upgraded from no phones
directly to cell phones. Jensen found that in small fishing villages, the advent of cell phones
allowed fishermen to determine on any given day where to take their catch to sell, resulting in
a large decrease in fish wasted and an increase in fishing profits. The ability of newer commu-
nication technology to aid development is one of the exciting features of our times. (See
Robert Jensen, “The Digital Provide: Information Technology, Market Performance, and
Welfare in the South Indian Fisheries Sector,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, August 2007,
879–924.)
The Economic Problem
Recall the three basic questions facing all economic systems: (1) What gets produced? (2) How is
it produced? and (3) Who gets it?
When Bill was alone on the island, the mechanism for answering those questions was
simple: He thought about his own wants and preferences, looked at the constraints imposed
by the resources of the island and his own skills and time, and made his decisions. As Bill set
about his work, he allocated available resources quite simply, more or less by dividing up his
available time. Distribution of the output was irrelevant. Because Bill was the society, he got
it all.

CHAPTER 2
The Economic Problem: Scarcity and Choice 39
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Trade-Offs among the Rich and Poor
In all societies, for all people, resources are limited relative to peo-
ple’s demands. There are, however, quite large differences in the
kinds of trade-offs individuals face in rich versus poor countries.
In 1990, the World Bank defined the extremely poor people of
the world as those earning less than $1 a day. Among development
economists and policy makers, this figure continues to be used as a
rough rule of thumb. In a recent survey, Esther Duflo and Abhijit
Banerjee, two MIT economists, surveyed individuals living at this
level in 13 countries across the world.1 What did they learn about
the consumption trade-offs faced by these individuals versus con-
sumers in the United States?
It should not surprise you to learn that for the extremely poor,
food is a much larger component of the budget. On average over the
13 countries, between 56 percent and 78 percent of consumption
was spent on food. In the United States just under 10 percent of the
average budget goes to food. Even for the poorest consumers, how-
ever, biological need is not all determining. The Banerjee and Duflo
study finds that in Udaipur, India, almost 10 percent of the typical
food budget goes to sugar and processed foods rather than more
nutritionally valuable grains. So even at these very low levels of
income, some choice remains. Perhaps more interestingly, almost
10 percent of the budget of those surveyed goes to weddings, funer-
als, and other festivals. In societies with very few entertainment
outlets, Banerjee and Duflo suggest we may see more demand for
festivals, indicating that even in extremely poor societies, household
choice plays a role.

Journal of Economic Perspective, Winter 2007, 21(1), 141–167.
Introducing even one more person into the economy—in this case, Colleen—changed all
that. With Colleen on the island, resource allocation involves deciding not only how each person
spends his or her time but also who does what; now there are two sets of wants and preferences.
If Bill and Colleen go off on their own and form two separate self-sufficient economies, there will
be lost potential. Two people can do more things together than each person can do alone. They
may use their comparative advantages in different skills to specialize. Cooperation and coordina-
tion may give rise to gains that would otherwise not be possible.
When a society consists of millions of people, the problem of coordination and coopera-
tion becomes enormous, but so does the potential for gain. In large, complex economies, spe-
cialization can go wild, with people working in jobs as different in their detail as an
impressionist painting is from a blank page. The range of products available in a modern
industrial society is beyond anything that could have been imagined a hundred years ago, and
so is the range of jobs.
The amount of coordination and cooperation in a modern industrial society is almost
impossible to imagine. Yet something seems to drive economic systems, if sometimes clumsily
and inefficiently, toward producing the goods and services that people want. Given scarce
resources, how do large, complex societies go about answering the three basic economic ques-
tions? This is the economic problem, which is what this text is about.
Economic Systems and the Role of
Government 
Thus far we have described the questions that the economic system must answer. Now we turn to
the mechanics of the system. Here the basic debate concerns the role of government.
On the one hand, many favor leaving the economy alone and keeping the government at bay
while others believe that there are many circumstances in which the government may be able to
improve the functioning of the market.

40
PART I
Introduction to Economics 
In November 2008, President Barack Obama was elected during a period of turmoil in the
world economy. In the United States during the month of the election over 700,000 jobs were
lost. A year later the unemployment rate was over 10 percent, and even into 2010, more than
15 million were unemployed. At the same time, the banking system nearly collapsed when mas-
sive home mortgage defaults led to bankruptcy filings by giants Bear Sterns and Lehmann
Brothers. The Federal Reserve System and the Treasury in response took action to save some big
banks and big auto companies with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). While some
called it a “bail out,”much of the federal expenditure on these troubled institutions was paid back
with interest.
In addition, during his first year, President Obama pushed hard for major reform of the
health care system, for much stronger government regulation of the financial markets, and for a
system designed to more effectively regulate energy consumption and protect the environment.
All of a sudden, the debate is all about the nature of the system. What should the govern-
ment be doing, and which decisions should be left to the free, private markets? Is it true that
the government should save companies or banks in trouble on the grounds that they are “too
big to fail”?
Command Economies
During the long struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union it was an all or nothing
proposition. The Soviet Union had a planned economy run by the government. In a pure
command economy, the basic economic questions are answered by a central government.
Through a combination of government ownership of state enterprises and central planning, the
government, either directly or indirectly, sets output targets, incomes, and prices.
While the extremes of central planning have been rejected, so too has the idea that “mar-
kets solve all problems.” The real debate is not about whether we have government at all, it is
about the extent and the character of a limited government role in the economy. One of the
major themes of this book is that government involvement, in theory, may improve the effi-
ciency and fairness of the allocation of a nation’s resources. At the same time, a poorly func-
tioning government can destroy incentives, lead to corruption, and result in the waste of a
society’s resources.
Laissez-Faire Economies: The Free Market
At the opposite end of the spectrum from the command economy is the laissez-faire economy.
The term laissez-faire, which translated literally from French means “allow [them] to do,” implies
a complete lack of government involvement in the economy. In this type of economy, individuals
and firms pursue their own self-interest without any central direction or regulation; the sum total
of millions of individual decisions ultimately determines all basic economic outcomes. The cen-
tral institution through which a laissez-faire system answers the basic questions is the market, a
term that is used in economics to mean an institution through which buyers and sellers interact
and engage in exchange.
The interactions between buyers and sellers in any market range from simple to complex.
Early explorers of the North American Midwest who wanted to exchange with Native Americans
did so simply by bringing their goods to a central place and trading them. Today the Internet is
revolutionizing exchange. A jewelry maker in upstate Maine can exhibit wares through digital
photographs on the Web. Buyers can enter orders or make bids and pay by credit card.
Companies such as eBay facilitate the worldwide interaction of tens of thousands of buyers and
sellers sitting at their computers.
In short:
laissez-faire economy
Literally from the French:
“allow [them] to do.” An
economy in which individual
people and firms pursue their
own self-interest without any
central direction or regulation.
command economy
An
economy in which a central
government either directly or
indirectly sets output targets,
incomes, and prices.
market
The institution
through which buyers and
sellers interact and engage in
exchange.
Some markets are simple and others are complex, but they all involve buyers and sellers
engaging in exchange. The behavior of buyers and sellers in a laissez-faire economy deter-
mines what gets produced, how it is produced, and who gets it.

CHAPTER 2
The Economic Problem: Scarcity and Choice 41
free enterprise
The freedom
of individuals to start and
operate private businesses in
search of profits.
The following chapters explore market systems in great depth. A quick preview is worthwhile
here, however.
Consumer Sovereignty
In a free, unregulated market, goods and services are produced
and sold only if the supplier can make a profit. In simple terms, making a profit means selling
goods or services for more than it costs to produce them. You cannot make a profit unless
someone wants the product that you are selling. This logic leads to the notion of consumer
sovereignty: The mix of output found in any free market system is dictated ultimately by the
tastes and preferences of consumers who “vote” by buying or not buying. Businesses rise and
fall in response to consumer demands. No central directive or plan is necessary.
Individual Production Decisions: Free Enterprise
Under a free market system,
individual producers must also determine how to organize and coordinate the actual produc-
tion of their products or services. The owner of a small shoe repair shop must alone buy the
needed equipment and tools, hang signs, and set prices. In a big corporation, so many people
are involved in planning the production process that in many ways, corporate planning
resembles the planning in a command economy. In a free market economy, producers may be
small or large. One person who hand-paints eggshells may start to sell them as a business; a
person good with computers may start a business designing Web sites. On a larger scale, a
group of furniture designers may put together a large portfolio of sketches, raise several mil-
lion dollars, and start a bigger business. At the extreme are huge corporations such as
Microsoft, Mitsubishi, and Intel, each of which sells tens of billions of dollars’ worth of prod-
ucts every year. Whether the firms are large or small, however, production decisions in a mar-
ket economy are made by separate private organizations acting in what they perceive to be
their own interests.
Often the market system is called a free enterprise system. Free enterprise means the free-
dom of individuals to start private businesses in search of profits. Because new businesses require
capital investment before they can begin operation, starting a new business involves risk. A well-
run business that produces a product for which demand exists is likely to succeed; a poorly run
business or one that produces a product for which little demand exists now or in the future is
likely to fail. It is through free enterprise that new products and new production techniques find
their way into use.
Proponents of free market systems argue that free enterprise leads to more efficient
production and better response to diverse and changing consumer preferences. If a producer
produces inefficiently, competitors will come along, fight for the business, and eventually take
it away. Thus, in a free market economy, competition forces producers to use efficient
techniques of production. It is competition, then, that ultimately dictates how output 
is produced.
Distribution of Output
In a free market system, the distribution of output—who gets
what—is also determined in a decentralized way. The amount that any one household gets
depends on its income and wealth. Income is the amount that a household earns each year. It
comes in a number of forms: wages, salaries, interest, and the like. Wealth is the amount that
households have accumulated out of past income through saving or inheritance.
To the extent that income comes from working for a wage, it is at least in part determined by
individual choice.You will work for the wages available in the market only if these wages (and the
products and services they can buy) are sufficient to compensate you for what you give up by
working. Your leisure certainly has a value also. You may discover that you can increase your
income by getting more education or training. You cannot increase your income, however, if you
acquire a skill that no one wants.
Price Theory
The basic coordinating mechanism in a free market system is price. A price is
the amount that a product sells for per unit, and it reflects what society is willing to pay. Prices
of inputs—labor, land, and capital—determine how much it costs to produce a product. Prices
of various kinds of labor, or wage rates, determine the rewards for working in different jobs and
consumer sovereignty
The
idea that consumers ultimately
dictate what will be produced
(or not produced) by choosing
what to purchase (and what
not to purchase).

42
PART I
Introduction to Economics 
Mixed Systems, Markets, and Governments
The differences between command economies and laissez-faire economies in their pure forms are
enormous. In fact, these pure forms do not exist in the world; all real systems are in some sense
“mixed.” That is, individual enterprise exists and independent choice is exercised even in
economies in which the government plays a major role.
Conversely, no market economies exist without government involvement and government
regulation. The United States has basically a free market economy, but government purchases
accounted for just over 20 percent of the country’s total production in 2010. Governments in the
United States (local, state, and federal) directly employ about 14 percent of all workers (15 per-
cent including active duty military). They also redistribute income by means of taxation and
social welfare expenditures, and they regulate many economic activities.
One of the major themes in this book, and indeed in economics, is the tension between the
advantages of free, unregulated markets and the desire for government involvement. Advocates of
free markets argue that such markets work best when left to themselves. They produce only what
people want; without buyers, sellers go out of business. Competition forces firms to adopt effi-
cient production techniques. Wage differentials lead people to acquire needed skills. Competition
also leads to innovation in both production techniques and products. The result is quality and
variety, but market systems have problems too. Even staunch defenders of the free enterprise sys-
tem recognize that market systems are not perfect. First, they do not always produce what people
want at the lowest cost—there are inefficiencies. Second, rewards (income) may be unfairly dis-
tributed and some groups may be left out. Third, periods of unemployment and inflation recur
with some regularity.
Many people point to these problems as reasons for government involvement. Indeed, for
some problems, government involvement may be the only solution. However, government deci-
sions are made by people who presumably, like the rest of us, act in their own self-interest. While
governments may be called on to improve the functioning of the economy, there is no guarantee
that they will do so. Just as markets may fail to produce an allocation of resources that is perfectly
efficient and fair, governments may fail to improve matters. We return to this debate many times
throughout this text.
Looking Ahead
This chapter described the economic problem in broad terms. We outlined the questions that all
economic systems must answer. We also discussed very broadly the two kinds of economic sys-
tems. In the next chapter, we analyze the way market systems work.
In a free market system, the basic economic questions are answered without the help of a
central government plan or directives. This is what the “free” in free market means—the
system is left to operate on its own with no outside interference. Individuals pursuing
their own self-interest will go into business and produce the products and services that
people want. Other individuals will decide whether to acquire skills; whether to work; and
whether to buy, sell, invest, or save the income that they earn. The basic coordinating
mechanism is price.
professions. Many of the independent decisions made in a market economy involve the weigh-
ing of prices and costs, so it is not surprising that much of economic theory focuses on the fac-
tors that influence and determine prices. This is why microeconomic theory is often simply
called price theory.
In sum:

CHAPTER 2
The Economic Problem: Scarcity and Choice 43
1. Every society has some system or process for transforming
into useful form what nature and previous generations
have provided. Economics is the study of that process and
its outcomes.
2. Producers are those who take resources and transform them
into usable products, or outputs. Private firms, households,
and governments all produce something.
SCARCITY, CHOICE, AND OPPORTUNITY COST p. 26
3. All societies must answer three basic questions: What 
gets produced? How is it produced? Who gets what 
is produced? These three questions make up the 
economic problem.
4. One person alone on an island must make the same basic
decisions that complex societies make. When a society
consists of more than one person, questions of distribution,
cooperation, and specialization arise.
5. Because resources are scarce relative to human wants in all
societies, using resources to produce one good or service
implies not using them to produce something else. This
concept of opportunity cost is central to an understanding 
of economics.
6. Using resources to produce capital that will in turn produce
benefits in the future implies not using those resources to
produce consumer goods in the present.
7. Even if one individual or nation is absolutely more efficient
at producing goods than another, all parties will gain if they
specialize in producing goods in which they have a
comparative advantage.
8. A production possibility frontier (ppf) is a graph that shows
all the combinations of goods and services that can be pro-
duced if all of society’s resources are used efficiently. The ppf
illustrates a number of important economic concepts:
scarcity, unemployment, inefficiency, increasing opportunity
cost, and economic growth.
9. Economic growth occurs when society produces more,
either by acquiring more resources or by learning to pro-
duce more with existing resources. Improved productivity
may come from additional capital or from the discovery
and application of new, more efficient techniques 
of production.
ECONOMIC SYSTEMS AND THE ROLE OF
GOVERNMENT p. 39
10. In some modern societies, government plays a big role in
answering the three basic questions. In pure command
economies, a central authority directly or indirectly sets out-
put targets, incomes, and prices.
11. A laissez-faire economy is one in which individuals indepen-
dently pursue their own self-interest, without any central
direction or regulation, and ultimately determine all basic
economic outcomes.
12. A market is an institution through which buyers and sellers
interact and engage in exchange. Some markets involve sim-
ple face-to-face exchange; others involve a complex series of
transactions, often over great distances or through elec-
tronic means.
13. There are no purely planned economies and no pure laissez-
faire economies; all economies are mixed. Individual enterprise,
independent choice, and relatively free markets exist in centrally
planned economies; there is significant government involve-
ment in market economies such as that of the United States.
14. One of the great debates in economics revolves around the
tension between the advantages of free, unregulated markets
and the desire for government involvement in the economy.
Free markets produce what people want, and competition
forces firms to adopt efficient production techniques. The
need for government intervention arises because free markets
are characterized by inefficiencies and an unequal distribu-
tion of income, and experience regular periods of inflation
and unemployment.

technology, the result will be efficient.” Do you agree or disagree
with this statement? Explain your answer.
3. You are an intern to the editor of a small-town newspaper in
Mallsburg, Pennsylvania. Your boss, the editor, asks you to
write the first draft of an editorial for this week’s paper. Your
assignment is to describe the costs and the benefits of building
a new bridge across the railroad tracks in the center of town.
Currently, most people who live in this town must drive 
2 miles through thickly congested traffic to the existing bridge
to get to the main shopping and employment center. The
bridge will cost the citizens of Mallsburg $25 million, which
will be paid for with a tax on their incomes over the next 20
years. What are the opportunity costs of building this bridge?
What are the benefits that citizens will likely receive if the
bridge is built? What other factors might you consider in writ-
ing this editorial?

*Note: Problems marked with an asterisk are more challenging.
7. Suppose that a simple society has an economy with only one
resource, labor. Labor can be used to produce only two
commodities—X, a necessity good (food), and Y, a luxury
good (music and merriment). Suppose that the labor force
consists of 100 workers. One laborer can produce either 5 units
of necessity per month (by hunting and gathering) or 10 units
of luxury per month (by writing songs, playing the guitar,
dancing, and so on).
a. On a graph, draw the economy’s ppf. Where does the ppf
intersect the Y-axis? Where does it intersect the X-axis? What
meaning do those points have?
b. Suppose the economy produced at a point inside the ppf.
Give at least two reasons why this could occur. What could
be done to move the economy to a point on the ppf?
c. Suppose you succeeded in lifting your economy to a point
on its ppf. What point would you choose? How might
your small society decide the point at which it wanted 
to be?
d. Once you have chosen a point on the ppf, you still need 
to decide how your society’s production will be divided.
If you were a dictator, how would you decide? What
would happen if you left product distribution to the 
free market?
*8. Match each diagram in Figure 1 with its description here.

These figures assume that a certain number of previously pro-
duced ovens are available in the current period for baking bread.

b. Does the principle of “increasing opportunity cost” hold in
this nation? Explain briefly. (Hint: What happens to the
opportunity cost of bread—measured in number of ovens—
as bread production increases?)
c. If this country chooses to produce both ovens and bread,
what will happen to the ppf over time? Why?

CHAPTER OUTLINE
Chapters 1 and 2 introduced the
discipline, methodology, and sub-
ject matter of economics. We now
begin the task of analyzing how a
market economy actually works.
This chapter and the next present
an overview of the way individual
markets work. They introduce
some of the concepts needed to
understand both microeconomics
and macroeconomics.
As we proceed to define terms
and make assumptions,
it is
important to keep in mind what
we are doing. In Chapter 1 we explained what economic theory attempts to do. Theories are
abstract representations of reality, like a map that represents a city. We believe that the models
presented here will help you understand the workings of the economy just as a map helps you
find your way around a city. Just as a map presents one view of the world, so too does any given
theory of the economy. Alternatives exist to the theory that we present. We believe, however, that
the basic model presented here, while sometimes abstract, is useful in gaining an understanding
of how the economy works.
In the simple island society discussed in Chapter 2, Bill and Colleen solved the economic
problem directly. They allocated their time and used the island’s resources to satisfy their wants.
Bill might be a farmer, Colleen a hunter and carpenter. He might be a civil engineer, she a doctor.
Exchange occurred, but complex markets were not necessary.
In societies of many people, however, production must satisfy wide-ranging tastes and pref-
erences. Producers therefore specialize. Farmers produce more food than they can eat so that they
can sell it to buy manufactured goods. Physicians are paid for specialized services, as are attor-
neys, construction workers, and editors. When there is specialization, there must be exchange,
and markets are the institutions through which exchange takes place.
This chapter begins to explore the basic forces at work in market systems. The purpose of
our discussion is to explain how the individual decisions of households and firms together, with-
out any central planning or direction, answer the three basic questions: What gets produced?
How is it produced? Who gets what is produced? We begin with some definitions.

Firms and Households: The Basic Decision-
Making Units
Throughout this book, we discuss and analyze the behavior of two fundamental decision-
making units: firms—the primary producing units in an economy—and households—the con-
suming units in an economy. Both are made up of people performing different functions and
playing different roles. In essence, what we are developing is a theory of human behavior.

48
PART I
Introduction to Economics 
firm
An organization that
transforms resources (inputs)
into products (outputs). Firms
are the primary producing
units in a market economy.
entrepreneur
A person who
organizes, manages, and
assumes the risks of a firm,
taking a new idea or a new
product and turning it into a
successful business.
households
The consuming
units in an economy.
product or output
markets
The markets in
which goods and services are
exchanged.
input or factor markets
The markets in which the
resources used to produce
goods and services are
exchanged.
A firm exists when a person or a group of people decides to produce a product or products
by transforming inputs—that is, resources in the broadest sense—into outputs, the products that
are sold in the market. Some firms produce goods; others produce services. Some are large,
many are small, and some are in between. All firms exist to transform resources into goods and
services that people want. The Colorado Symphony Orchestra takes labor, land, a building,
musically talented people, instruments, and other inputs and combines them to produce con-
certs. The production process can be extremely complicated. For example, the first flautist in the
orchestra uses training, talent, previous performance experience, score, instrument, conductor’s
interpretation, and personal feelings about the music to produce just one contribution to an
overall performance.
Most firms exist to make a profit for their owners, but some do not. Columbia University, for
example, fits the description of a firm: It takes inputs in the form of labor, land, skills, books, and
buildings and produces a service that we call education. Although the university sells that service
for a price, it does not exist to make a profit; instead, it exists to provide education of the highest
quality possible.
Still, most firms exist to make a profit. They engage in production because they can sell their
product for more than it costs to produce it. The analysis of a firm’s behavior that follows rests on
the assumption that firms make decisions in order to maximize profits. Sometimes firms suffer
losses instead of earning profits. In recent years this has occurred frequently. When firms suffer
losses, we will assume that they act to minimize those losses.
An entrepreneur is someone who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a firm. When
a new firm is created, someone must organize the new firm, arrange financing, hire employees,
and take risks. That person is an entrepreneur. Sometimes existing firms introduce new products,
and sometimes new firms develop or improve on an old idea, but at the root of it all is entrepre-
neurship, which some see as the core of the free enterprise system.
The consuming units in an economy are households. A household may consist of any num-
ber of people: a single person living alone, a married couple with four children, or 15 unrelated
people sharing a house. Household decisions are presumably based on individual tastes and pref-
erences. The household buys what it wants and can afford. In a large, heterogeneous, and open
society such as the United States, wildly different tastes find expression in the marketplace. A six-
block walk in any direction on any street in Manhattan or a drive from the Chicago Loop south
into rural Illinois should be enough to convince anyone that it is difficult to generalize about
what people do and do not like.
Even though households have wide-ranging preferences, they also have some things in
common. All—even the very rich—have ultimately limited incomes, and all must pay in some
way for the goods and services they consume. Although households may have some control over
their incomes—they can work more hours or fewer hours—they are also constrained by the
availability of jobs, current wages, their own abilities, and their accumulated and inherited
wealth (or lack thereof).
Input Markets and Output Markets: 
The Circular Flow
Households and firms interact in two basic kinds of markets: product (or output) markets
and input (or factor) markets. Goods and services that are intended for use by households 
are exchanged in product or output markets. In output markets, firms supply and house-
holds demand.
To produce goods and services, firms must buy resources in input or factor markets.
Firms buy inputs from households, which supply these inputs. When a firm decides how much
to produce (supply) in output markets, it must simultaneously decide how much of each input
it needs to produce the desired level of output. To produce automobiles, Ford Motor Company
must use many inputs, including tires, steel, complicated machinery, and many different kinds
of labor.

Diagrams like this one show the circular flow of economic activity, hence the name circular flow diagram. Here
goods and services flow clockwise: Labor services supplied by households flow to firms, and goods and ser-
vices produced by firms flow to households. Payment (usually money) flows in the opposite (counterclock-
wise) direction: Payment for goods and services flows from households to firms, and payment for labor
services flows from firms to households.
Note: Color Guide—In Figure 3.1 households are depicted in blue and firms are depicted in red. From now on all diagrams
relating to the behavior of households will be blue or shades of blue and all diagrams relating to the behavior of firms will
be red or shades of red.
labor market
The
input/factor market in which
households supply work
for wages to firms that
demand labor.
capital market
The
input/factor market in which
households supply their
savings, for interest or
for claims to future profits,
to firms that demand funds to
buy capital goods.
land market
The input/factor
market in which households
supply land or other real
property in exchange for rent.
factors of production
The inputs into the production
process. Land, labor, and
capital are the three key factors
of production.
Figure 3.1 shows the circular flow of economic activity through a simple market economy.
Note that the flow reflects the direction in which goods and services flow through input and
output markets. For example, real goods and services flow from firms to households through
output—or product—markets. Labor services flow from households to firms through input mar-
kets. Payment (most often in money form) for goods and services flows in the opposite direction.
In input markets, households supply resources. Most households earn their incomes by
working—they supply their labor in the labor market to firms that demand labor and pay work-
ers for their time and skills. Households may also loan their accumulated or inherited savings to
firms for interest or exchange those savings for claims to future profits, as when a household buys
shares of stock in a corporation. In the capital market, households supply the funds that firms
use to buy capital goods. Households may also supply land or other real property in exchange for
rent in the land market.
Inputs into the production process are also called factors of production. Land, labor, and
capital are the three key factors of production. Throughout this text, we use the terms input
and factor of production interchangeably. Thus, input markets and factor markets mean the
same thing.
Early economics texts included entrepreneurship as a type of input, just like land, labor, and
capital. Treating entrepreneurship as a separate factor of production has fallen out of favor,
however, partially because it is unmeasurable. Most economists today implicitly assume that

50
PART I
Introduction to Economics 
entrepreneurship is in plentiful supply. That is, if profit opportunities exist, it is likely that entre-
preneurs will crop up to take advantage of them. This assumption has turned out to be a good
predictor of actual economic behavior and performance.
The supply of inputs and their prices ultimately determine household income. Thus, the
amount of income a household earns depends on the decisions it makes concerning what types
of inputs it chooses to supply. Whether to stay in school, how much and what kind of training to
get, whether to start a business, how many hours to work, whether to work at all, and how to
invest savings are all household decisions that affect income.
As you can see:
Input and output markets are connected through the behavior of both firms and house-
holds. Firms determine the quantities and character of outputs produced and the types and
quantities of inputs demanded. Households determine the types and quantities of products
demanded and the quantities and types of inputs supplied.1
The following analysis of demand and supply will lead up to a theory of how market prices
are determined. Prices are determined by the interaction between demanders and suppliers. To
understand this interaction, we first need to know how product prices influence the behavior of
demanders and suppliers separately. Therefore, we discuss output markets by focusing first on
demanders, then on suppliers, and finally on their interaction.
Demand in Product/Output Markets
In real life, households make many decisions at the same time. To see how the forces of demand
and supply work, however, let us focus first on the amount of a single product that an individual
household decides to consume within some given period of time, such as a month or a year.
A household’s decision about what quantity of a particular output, or product, to demand
depends on a number of factors, including:
 The price of the product in question.
 The income available to the household.
 The household’s amount of accumulated wealth.
 The prices of other products available to the household.
 The household’s tastes and preferences.
 The household’s expectations about future income, wealth, and prices.
Quantity demanded is the amount (number of units) of a product that a household would buy
in a given period if it could buy all it wanted at the current market price. Of course, the amount of a
product that households finally purchase depends on the amount of product actually available in the
market. The expression if it could buy all it wanted is critical to the definition of quantity demanded
because it allows for the possibility that quantity supplied and quantity demanded are unequal.
quantity demanded
The
amount (number of units) of a
product that a household
would buy in a given period if
it could buy all it wanted at the
current market price.
1 Our description of markets begins with the behavior of firms and households. Modern orthodox economic theory essentially com-
bines two distinct but closely related theories of behavior. The “theory of household behavior,”or “consumer behavior,”has its roots
in the works of nineteenth-century utilitarians such as Jeremy Bentham, William Jevons, Carl Menger, Leon Walras,Vilfredo Parcto,
and F.Y. Edgeworth. The “theory of the firm”developed out of the earlier classical political economy of Adam Smith, David Ricardo,
and Thomas Malthus. In 1890, Alfred Marshall published the first of many editions of his Principles of Economics. That volume pulled
together the main themes of both the classical economists and the utilitarians into what is now called neoclassical economics. While
there have been many changes over the years, the basic structure of the model that we build can be found in Marshall’s work.

Changes in Quantity Demanded versus 
Changes in Demand
The most important relationship in individual markets is that between market price and quan-
tity demanded. For this reason, we need to begin our discussion by analyzing the likely
response of households to changes in price using the device of ceteris paribus, or “all else
equal.” That is, we will attempt to derive a relationship between the quantity demanded of a
good per time period and the price of that good, holding income, wealth, other prices, tastes,
and expectations constant.
It is very important to distinguish between price changes, which affect the quantity of a good
demanded, and changes in other factors (such as income), which change the entire relationship
between price and quantity. For example, if a family begins earning a higher income, it might buy
more of a good at every possible price. To be sure that we distinguish between changes in price
and other changes that affect demand, throughout the rest of the text, we will be very precise
about terminology. Specifically:
Changes in the price of a product affect the quantity demanded per period. Changes in any
other factor, such as income or preferences, affect demand. Thus, we say that an increase in
the price of Coca-Cola is likely to cause a decrease in the quantity of Coca-Cola demanded.
However, we say that an increase in income is likely to cause an increase in the demand for
most goods.
Price and Quantity Demanded: The Law of Demand
A demand schedule shows how much of a product a person or household is willing to purchase
per time period (each week or each month) at different prices. Clearly that decision is based on
numerous interacting factors. Consider Alex who just graduated from college with an entry-level
job at a local bank. During her senior year, Alex got a car loan and bought a used Mini Cooper.
The Mini gets 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alex lives with several friends in a house 10 miles
from her workplace and enjoys visiting her parents 50 miles away.
How often Alex will decide to drive herself to work and parties, visit her family, or even go
joy riding depends on many things, including her income and whether she likes to drive. But the
price of gasoline also plays an important role, and it is this relationship between price and quan-
tity demanded that we focus on in the law of demand. With a gasoline price of $3.00 a gallon,
Alex might decide to drive herself to work every day, visit her parents once a week, and drive
another 50 miles a week for other activities. This driving pattern would add up to 250 miles a
week, which would use 10 gallons of gasoline in her Mini. The demand schedule in Table 3.1 thus
shows that at a price of $3.00 per gallon, Alex is willing to buy 10 gallons of gasoline. We can see
that this demand schedule reflects a lot of information about Alex including where she lives and
works and what she likes to do in her spare time.
Now suppose an international crisis in the Middle East causes the price of gasoline at the
pump to rise to $5.00 per gallon. How does this affect Alex’s demand for gasoline, assuming that
everything else remains the same? Driving is now more expensive, and we would not be surprised
if Alex decided to take the bus some mornings or share a ride with friends. She might visit her par-
ents less frequently as well. On the demand schedule given in Table 3.1, Alex cuts her desired con-
sumption of gasoline by half to 5 gallons when the price goes to $5.00. If, instead, the price of
gasoline fell substantially, Alex might well spend more time driving, and that is in fact the pattern
we see in the table. This same information presented graphically is called a demand curve. Alex’s
demand curve is presented in Figure 3.2. You will note in Figure 3.2 that quantity (q) is measured
along the horizontal axis and price (P) is measured along the vertical axis. This is the convention
we follow throughout this book.

Demand Curves Slope Downward
The data in Table 3.1 show that at lower prices, Alex
buys more gasoline; at higher prices, she buys less. Thus, there is a negative, or inverse, relationship
between quantity demanded and price. When price rises, quantity demanded falls, and when price
falls, quantity demanded rises. Thus, demand curves always slope downward. This negative rela-
tionship between price and quantity demanded is often referred to as the law of demand, a term
first used by economist Alfred Marshall in his 1890 textbook.
Some people are put off by the abstraction of demand curves. Of course, we do not actu-
ally draw our own demand curves for products. When we want to make a purchase, we usually
face only a single price and how much we would buy at other prices is irrelevant. However,
demand curves help analysts understand the kind of behavior that households are likely to
exhibit if they are actually faced with a higher or lower price. We know, for example, that if the
price of a good rises enough, the quantity demanded must ultimately drop to zero. The
demand curve is thus a tool that helps us explain economic behavior and predict reactions to
possible price changes.

 FIGURE 3.2 Alex’s Demand Curve
The relationship between price (P) and quantity demanded (q) presented graphically is called a demand
curve. Demand curves have a negative slope, indicating that lower prices cause quantity demanded to
increase. Note that Alex’s demand curve is blue; demand in product markets is determined by house-
hold choice.
law of demand
The negative
relationship between price and
quantity demanded: As price
rises, quantity demanded
decreases; as price falls,
quantity demanded increases.

Marshall’s definition of a social “law” captures the idea:
The term “law” means nothing more than a general proposition or statement of tenden-
cies, more or less certain, more or less definite . . . a social law is a statement of social ten-
dencies; that is, that a certain course of action may be expected from the members of a
social group under certain conditions.2
It seems reasonable to expect that consumers will demand more of a product at a lower price
and less of it at a higher price. Households must divide their incomes over a wide range of goods
and services. At $3.00 per gallon and 25 miles to a gallon, driving the 20 miles round trip to work
costs Alex $2.40. At $5.00 per gallon, the trip now costs $4.00. With the higher prices, Alex may
have to give up her morning latte if she drives, and that may turn out to be too big a sacrifice for
her. As the price of gasoline rises, the opportunity cost of driving in terms of other types of con-
sumption also rises and that is why Alex ends up driving less as the price of gasoline rises. Goods
compete with one another for our spending.
Economists use the concept of utility to explain the slope of the demand curve. Presumably,
we consume goods and services because they give us utility or satisfaction.As we consume more of
a product within a given period of time, it is likely that each additional unit consumed will yield
successively less satisfaction. The utility you gain from a second ice cream cone is likely to be less
than the utility you gained from the first, the third is worth even less, and so on. This law of
diminishing marginal utility is an important concept in economics. If each successive unit of a
good is worth less to you, you are not going to be willing to pay as much for it. Thus, it is reason-
able to expect a downward slope in the demand curve for that good.
Thinking about the ways that people are affected by price changes also helps us see what is
behind the law of demand. Consider this example: Luis lives and works in Mexico City. His
elderly mother lives in Santiago, Chile. Last year the airlines servicing South America got into a
price war, and the price of flying between Mexico City and Santiago dropped from 20,000 pesos
to 10,000 pesos. How might Luis’s behavior change?
First, he is better off. Last year he flew home to Chile three times at a total cost of
60,000 pesos. This year he can fly to Chile the same number of times, buy exactly the same com-
bination of other goods and services that he bought last year, and have 30,000 pesos left over.
Because he is better off—his income can buy more—he may fly home more frequently. Second,
the opportunity cost of flying home has changed. Before the price war, Luis had to sacrifice
20,000 pesos worth of other goods and services each time he flew to Chile. After the price war,
he must sacrifice only 10,000 pesos worth of other goods and services for each trip. The trade-
off has changed. Both of these effects are likely to lead to a higher quantity demanded in
response to the lower price.
In sum:
It is reasonable to expect quantity demanded to fall when price rises, ceteris paribus, and to
expect quantity demanded to rise when price falls, ceteris paribus. Demand curves have a
negative slope.
Other Properties of Demand Curves
Two additional things are notable about Alex’s
demand curve. First, it intersects the Y, or price, axis. This means that there is a price above
which she buys no gasoline. In this case, Alex simply stops driving when the price reaches $8 per
gallon. As long as households have limited incomes and wealth, all demand curves will intersect
the price axis. For any commodity, there is always a price above which a household will not or
cannot pay. Even if the good or service is very important, all households are ultimately con-
strained, or limited, by income and wealth.

PART I
Introduction to Economics 
Second, Alex’s demand curve intersects the X, or quantity, axis. Even at a zero price, there is a
limit to how much she will drive. If gasoline were free, she would use 26 gallons, but not more.
That demand curves intersect the quantity axis is a matter of common sense. Demand in a given
period of time is limited, if only by time, even at a zero price.
To summarize what we know about the shape of demand curves:
1. They have a negative slope. An increase in price is likely to lead to a decrease in quantity
demanded, and a decrease in price is likely to lead to an increase in quantity demanded.
2. They intersect the quantity (X-) axis, a result of time limitations and diminishing mar-
ginal utility.
3. They intersect the price (Y-) axis, a result of limited income and wealth.
That is all we can say; it is not possible to generalize further. The actual shape of an individ-
ual household demand curve—whether it is steep or flat, whether it is bowed in or bowed out—
depends on the unique tastes and preferences of the household and other factors. Some
households may be very sensitive to price changes; other households may respond little to a
change in price. In some cases, plentiful substitutes are available; in other cases, they are not.
Thus, to fully understand the shape and position of demand curves, we must turn to the other
determinants of household demand.
Other Determinants of Household Demand
Of the many factors likely to influence a household’s demand for a specific product, we have consid-
ered only the price of the product. Other determining factors include household income and
wealth, the prices of other goods and services, tastes and preferences, and expectations.
Income and Wealth
Before we proceed, we need to define two terms that are often con-
fused, income and wealth. A household’s income is the sum of all the wages, salaries, profits,
interest payments, rents, and other forms of earnings received by the household in a given
period of time. Income is thus a flow measure: We must specify a time period for it—income
per month or per year. You can spend or consume more or less than your income in any given
period. If you consume less than your income, you save. To consume more than your income
in a period, you must either borrow or draw on savings accumulated from previous periods.
Wealth is the total value of what a household owns minus what it owes. Another word for
wealth is net worth—the amount a household would have left if it sold all of its possessions and
paid all of its debts. Wealth is a stock measure: It is measured at a given point in time. If, in a given
period, you spend less than your income, you save; the amount that you save is added to your
wealth. Saving is the flow that affects the stock of wealth. When you spend more than your
income, you dissave—you reduce your wealth.
Households with higher incomes and higher accumulated savings or inherited wealth can
afford to buy more goods and services. In general, we would expect higher demand at higher levels
of income/wealth and lower demand at lower levels of income/wealth. Goods for which demand
goes up when income is higher and for which demand goes down when income is lower are called
normal goods. Movie tickets, restaurant meals, telephone calls, and shirts are all normal goods.
However, generalization in economics can be hazardous. Sometimes demand for a good falls
when household income rises. Consider, for example, the various qualities of meat available.
When a household’s income rises, it is likely to buy higher-quality meats—its demand for filet
mignon is likely to rise—but its demand for lower-quality meats—chuck steak, for example—is
likely to fall. Transportation is another example. At higher incomes, people can afford to fly.
People who can afford to fly are less likely to take the bus long distances. Thus, higher income
may reduce the number of times someone takes a bus. Goods for which demand tends to fall
when income rises are called inferior goods.
Prices of Other Goods and Services
No consumer decides in isolation on the amount
of any one commodity to buy. Instead, each decision is part of a larger set of decisions that are
made simultaneously. Households must apportion their incomes over many different goods and
services. As a result, the price of any one good can and does affect the demand for other goods.
This is most obviously the case when goods are substitutes for one another. For Alex the bus is an
alternative that she uses when gasoline gets expensive.

CHAPTER 3
Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium 55
When an increase in the price of one good causes demand for another good to increase (a
positive relationship), we say that the goods are substitutes. A fall in the price of a good causes
a decline in demand for its substitutes. Substitutes are goods that can serve as replacements for
one another.
To be substitutes, two products do not need to be identical. Identical products are called
perfect substitutes. Japanese cars are not identical to American cars. Nonetheless, all have four
wheels, are capable of carrying people, and run on gasoline. Thus, significant changes in the price
of one country’s cars can be expected to influence demand for the other country’s cars.
Restaurant meals are substitutes for meals eaten at home, and flying from New York to
Washington, D.C., is a substitute for taking the train.
Often two products “go together”—that is, they complement each other. Bacon and eggs are
complementary goods, as are cars and gasoline, and cameras and film. When two goods are
complements, a decrease in the price of one results in an increase in demand for the other and vice
versa. The makers of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, two popular and competitive video games, under-
stand that there is a strong connection between how many songs can be played on their operating plat-
forms and how strong the demand is for their games. For iPods and Kindles as well, the availability of
content at low prices stimulates demand for the devices. The Economics in Practice above talks about
the complementarity between the Kindle and e-books.
Tastes and Preferences
Income, wealth, and prices of goods available are the three factors
that determine the combinations of goods and services that a household is able to buy. You know
that you cannot afford to rent an apartment at $1,200 per month if your monthly income is only
$400, but within these constraints, you are more or less free to choose what to buy. Your final
choice depends on your individual tastes and preferences.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Kindle in the College Market?
Most of you are likely quite aware of the high price of text-
books. For some students, high prices lead to sharing texts or
using library copies. Jeff Bezos, who runs Amazon, the pro-
ducer of the Kindle, thinks the high prices of printed text
books provides an opportunity for his company to increase
the demand for the Kindle.
People buy Kindles so that they can read books on them.
Books are thus a complement to the Kindle. The cheaper the
electronic books you can buy are, the higher your demand
for the Kindle device. As the article here suggests, Amazon is
working with several universities and textbook publishers to
make textbooks available—for a much lower price—on the
Kindle. As the last line of the article tells us, this move is
clearly intended to build demand for the Kindle itself. The
president of Amazon is well aware of the role of comple-
ments in his business.
Amazon to Launch Kindle for Textbooks
The Wall Street Journal
Beginning this fall, some students at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland will be given large-screen Kindles with
textbooks for chemistry, computer science, and a freshman
seminar already installed, said Lev Gonick, the school’s chief
information officer. The university plans to compare the experi-
ences of students who get the Kindles and those who use tra-
ditional textbooks, he said.
Amazon has worked out a deal with several textbook pub-
lishers to make their materials available for the device. Five
other universities are involved in the Kindle project, according to
people briefed on the matter. They are Pace, Princeton, Reed,
Darden School at the University of Virginia, and Arizona State.
The moves are the latest by Amazon to promote the Kindle,
which is the company’s first consumer-electronics device.

Changes in preferences can and do manifest themselves in market behavior. Thirty years
ago the major big-city marathons drew only a few hundred runners. Now tens of thousands
enter and run. The demand for running shoes, running suits, stopwatches, and other running
items has greatly increased. For many years, people drank soda for refreshment. Today conve-
nience stores are filled with a dizzying array of iced teas, fruit juices, natural beverages, and
mineral waters.
Within the constraints of prices and incomes, preference shapes the demand curve, but it is
difficult to generalize about tastes and preferences. First, they are volatile: Five years ago more
people smoked cigarettes and fewer people had computers. Second, tastes are idiosyncratic:
Some people like to text, whereas others still prefer to use e-mail; some people prefer dogs,
whereas others are crazy about cats. Some eat fried cockroaches. The diversity of individual
demands is almost infinite.
One of the interesting questions in economics is why, in some markets, diverse con-
sumer tastes give rise to a variety of styles, while in other markets, despite a seeming diversity
in tastes, we find only one or two varieties. All sidewalks in the United States are a similar
gray color, yet houses are painted a rainbow of colors. Yet it is not obvious on the face of it
that people would not prefer as much variety in their sidewalks as in their houses. To answer
this type of question, we need to move beyond the demand curve. We will revisit this ques-
tion in a later chapter.
Expectations
What you decide to buy today certainly depends on today’s prices and your
current income and wealth. You also have expectations about what your position will be in the
future. You may have expectations about future changes in prices too, and these may affect your
decisions today.
There are many examples of the ways expectations affect demand. When people buy a house
or a car, they often must borrow part of the purchase price and repay it over a number of years. In
deciding what kind of house or car to buy, they presumably must think about their income today,
as well as what their income is likely to be in the future.
As another example, consider a student in the final year of medical school living on a
scholarship of $12,000. Compare that student with another person earning $6 an hour at a full-
time job, with no expectation of a significant change in income in the future. The two have virtu-
ally identical incomes because there are about 2,000 working hours in a year (40 hours per
week  50 work weeks per year). But even if they have the same tastes, the medical student is
likely to demand different goods and services, simply because of the expectation of a major
increase in income later on.
Increasingly, economic theory has come to recognize the importance of expectations. We
will devote a good deal of time to discussing how expectations affect more than just demand. For
the time being, however, it is important to understand that demand depends on more than just
current incomes, prices, and tastes.
Shift of Demand versus Movement Along a Demand Curve
Recall that a demand curve shows the relationship between quantity demanded and the price of a
good. Demand curves are derived while holding income, tastes, and other prices constant. If
income, tastes, or other prices change, we would have to derive an entirely new relationship
between price and quantity.
Let us return once again to Alex. (See Table 3.1 and Figure 3.2 on p. 52.) Suppose that
when we derived the demand curve in Figure 3.1 Alex was receiving a salary of $500 per week
after taxes. If Alex faces a price of $3.00 per gallon and chooses to drive 250 miles per week, her
total weekly expenditure works out to be $3.00 per gallon times 10 gallons of $30 per week.
That amounts to 6.0 percent of her income.
Suppose now she were to receive a raise to $700 per week after taxes. Then if she continued
to buy only 10 gallons of gasoline a week it would absorb a smaller percentage of her income. The
56
PART I

CHAPTER 3    Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium 57
higher income may well raise the amount of gasoline being used by Alex regardless of what she
was using before. Notice in Figure 3.3 that the entire curve has shifted to the right—at $3.00 a gal-
lon the curve shows an increase in the quantity demanded from 10 to 15 gallons. At $5.00, the
quantity demanded by Alex increases from 5 gallons to 10 gallons.
The fact that demand increased when income increased implies that gasoline is a normal good
to Alex.

When the price of a good changes, we move along the demand curve for that good. When any other factor

to

Introduction to Economics 
The conditions that were in place at the time we drew the original demand curve have now
changed. In other words, a factor that affects Alex’s demand for gasoline (in this case, her income)
has changed, and there is now a new relationship between price and quantity demanded. Such a
change is referred to as a shift of a demand curve.
It is very important to distinguish between a change in quantity demanded—that is, some
movement along a demand curve—and a shift of demand. Demand schedules and demand
curves show the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded
per period, ceteris paribus. If price changes, quantity demanded will change—this is a
movement along a demand curve. When any of the other factors that influence demand
change, however, a new relationship between price and quantity demanded is established—this
is a shift of a demand curve. The result, then, is a new demand curve. Changes in income, prefer-
ences, or prices of other goods cause a demand curve to shift:
Change in price of a good or service leads to
Change in quantity demanded (movement along a demand curve).
Change in income, preferences, or prices of other goods or services leads to
Change in demand (shift of a demand curve).
Figure 3.4 on the next page illustrates the differences between movement along a demand
curve and shifting demand curves. In Figure 3.4(a), an increase in household income causes
demand for hamburger (an inferior good) to decline, or shift to the left from 
to 
. (Because
quantity is measured on the horizontal axis, a decrease means a shift to the left.) In contrast,
demand for steak (a normal good) increases, or shifts to the right, when income rises.
In Figure 3.4(b), an increase in the price of hamburger from $1.49 to $3.09 a pound
causes a household to buy less hamburger each month. In other words, the higher price
causes the quantity demanded to decline from 10 pounds to 5 pounds per month. This
change represents a movement along the demand curve for hamburger. In place of ham-
burger, the household buys more chicken. The household’s demand for chicken (a substitute
for hamburger) rises—the demand curve shifts to the right. At the same time, the demand
for ketchup (a good that complements hamburger) declines—its demand curve shifts to 
the left.
From Household Demand to Market Demand
Market demand is simply the sum of all the quantities of a good or service demanded per
period by all the households buying in the market for that good or service. Figure 3.5 shows
the derivation of a market demand curve from three individual demand curves. (Although
this market demand curve is derived from the behavior of only three people, most markets
have thousands, or even millions of demanders.) As the table in Figure 3.5 shows, when the
price of a pound of coffee is $3.50, both household A and household C would purchase 
4 pounds per month, while household B would buy none. At that price, presumably, B drinks
tea. Market demand at $3.50 would thus be a total of
, or 8 pounds. At a price of $1.50 per
pound, however, A would purchase 8 pounds per month; B, 3 pounds; and C, 9 pounds.
Thus, at $1.50 per pound, market demand would be 
, or 20 pounds of coffee 
per month.
The total quantity demanded in the marketplace at a given price is simply the sum of all the
quantities demanded by all the individual households shopping in the market at that price. A
market demand curve shows the total amount of a product that would be sold at each price if
households could buy all they wanted at that price. As Figure 3.5 shows, the market demand
curve is the sum of all the individual demand curves—that is, the sum of all the individual quan-
tities demanded at each price. Thus, the market demand curve takes its shape and position from
the shapes, positions, and number of individual demand curves. If more people decide to shop in

a market, more demand curves must be added and the market demand curve will shift to the
right. Market demand curves may also shift as a result of preference changes, income changes, or
changes in the number of demanders.
An interesting fact about the market demand curve in Figure 3.5 is that at different
prices, not only the number of people demanding the product may change but also the type of
people demanding the product. When Apple halved the price of its iPhone in fall 2007, it
announced that it wanted to make the iPhone available to a broader group of people. When
prices fall, people like those in household B in Figure 3.5 move into markets that are other-
wise out of their reach.
As a general rule throughout this book, capital letters refer to the entire market and
lowercase letters refer to individual households or firms. Thus, in Figure 3.5, Q refers to total
quantity demanded in the market, while q refers to the quantity demanded by individ-
ual households.
Supply in Product/Output Markets
We turn now to explore the other half of markets, the firms that supply the goods and services
consumers want to purchase. What determines their willingness to produce and distribute the
goods and services that people want? How do we understand the supply part of the market?

 FIGURE 3.5 Deriving Market Demand from Individual Demand Curves
Total demand in the marketplace is simply the sum of the demands of all the households shopping in a
particular market. It is the sum of all the individual demand curves—that is, the sum of all the individual
quantities demanded at each price.

CHAPTER 3
Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium 61
Firms build factories, hire workers, and buy raw materials because they believe they can sell
the products they make for more than it costs to produce them. In other words, firms supply
goods and services because they believe it will be profitable to do so. Supply decisions thus
depend on profit potential. Because profit is the difference between revenues and costs, supply is
likely to react to changes in revenues and changes in production costs. The amount of revenue
that a firm earns depends on what the price of its product in the market is and on how much it
sells. Costs of production depend on many factors, the most important of which are (1) the kinds
of inputs needed to produce the product, (2) the amount of each input required, and (3) the
prices of inputs.
In later chapters, we will focus on how firms decide how to produce their goods and services
and explore the cost side of the picture more formally. For now, we will begin our examination of
firm behavior by focusing on the output supply decision and the relationship between quantity
supplied and output price, ceteris paribus.
Price and Quantity Supplied: The Law of Supply
Quantity supplied is the amount of a particular product that firms would be willing and able to
offer for sale at a particular price during a given time period. A supply schedule shows how
much of a product firms will sell at alternative prices.
Let us look at an agricultural market as an example. Table 3.3 itemizes the quantities of soy-
beans that an individual representative farmer such as Clarence Brown might sell at various
prices. If the market paid $1.50 or less for a bushel for soybeans, Brown would not supply any soy-
beans: When Farmer Brown looks at the costs of growing soybeans, including the opportunity
cost of his time and land, $1.50 per bushel will not compensate him for those costs. At $1.75 per
bushel, however, at least some soybean production takes place on Brown’s farm, and a price
increase from $1.75 to $2.25 per bushel causes the quantity supplied by Brown to increase from
10,000 to 20,000 bushels per year. The higher price may justify shifting land from wheat to soy-
bean production or putting previously fallow land into soybeans, or it may lead to more intensive
farming of land already in soybeans, using expensive fertilizer or equipment that was not cost-
justified at the lower price.

Generalizing from Farmer Brown’s experience, we can reasonably expect an increase in
market price, ceteris paribus, to lead to an increase in quantity supplied for Brown and farmers
like him. In other words, there is a positive relationship between the quantity of a good sup-
plied and price. This statement sums up the law of supply: An increase in market price will
lead to an increase in quantity supplied, and a decrease in market price will lead to a decrease
in quantity supplied.

PART I
Introduction to Economics 
The information in a supply schedule may be presented graphically in a supply curve.
Supply curves slope upward. The upward, or positive, slope of Brown’s curve in Figure 3.6 reflects
this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied.
Note in Brown’s supply schedule, however, that when price rises from $4 to $5, quantity sup-
plied no longer increases. Often an individual firm’s ability to respond to an increase in price is
constrained by its existing scale of operations, or capacity, in the short run. For example, Brown’s
ability to produce more soybeans depends on the size of his farm, the fertility of his soil, and the
types of equipment he has. The fact that output stays constant at 45,000 bushels per year suggests
that he is running up against the limits imposed by the size of his farm, the quality of his soil, and
his existing technology.
In the longer run, however, Brown may acquire more land or technology may change, allow-
ing for more soybean production. The terms short run and long run have very precise meanings in
economics; we will discuss them in detail later. Here it is important only to understand that time
plays a critical role in supply decisions. When prices change, firms’ immediate response may be
different from what they are able to do after a month or a year. Short-run and long-run supply
curves are often different.
Other Determinants of Supply
Of the factors we have listed that are likely to affect the quantity of output supplied by a given
firm, we have thus far discussed only the price of output. Other factors that affect supply include
the cost of producing the product and the prices of related products.
The Cost of Production
For a firm to make a profit, its revenue must exceed its costs.
As an individual producer, like Farmer Brown, thinks about how much to supply at a particu-
lar price, the producer will be looking at his or her costs. Brown’s supply decision is likely to
change in response to changes in the cost of production. Cost of production depends on a

number of factors, including the available technologies and the prices and quantities of the
inputs needed by the firm (labor, land, capital, energy, and so on).
Technological change can have an enormous impact on the cost of production over time.
Consider agriculture. The introduction of fertilizers, the development of complex farm machin-
ery, and the use of bioengineering to increase the yield of individual crops have all powerfully
affected the cost of producing agricultural products. Farm productivity in the United States has
been increasing dramatically for decades.Yield per acre of corn production has increased fivefold
since the late 1930s, and the amount of labor required to produce 100 bushels of corn has fallen
from 108 hours in the late 1930s to 20 hours in the late 1950s to less than 2 hours today. (See
Table 2.2 on p. 37.)
When a technological advance lowers the cost of production, output is likely to increase.
When yield per acre increases, individual farmers can and do produce more. The output of the
Ford Motor Company increased substantially after the introduction of assembly-line techniques.
The production of electronic calculators, and later personal computers, boomed with the devel-
opment of inexpensive techniques to produce microprocessors.
Cost of production is also directly affected by the price of the factors of production. In the
spring of 2008, the world price of oil rose to more than $100 per barrel from below $20 in 2002. As
a result, cab drivers faced higher gasoline prices, airlines faced higher fuel costs, and manufactur-
ing firms faced higher heating bills. The result: Cab drivers probably spent less time driving
around looking for customers, airlines cut a few low-profit routes, and some manufacturing plants
stopped running extra shifts. The moral of this story: Increases in input prices raise costs of pro-
duction and are likely to reduce supply. The reverse occurred in 2009–2010 when oil prices fell
back to $75 per barrel.
The Prices of Related Products
Firms often react to changes in the prices of related
products. For example, if land can be used for either corn or soybean production, an increase in
soybean prices may cause individual farmers to shift acreage out of corn production into soy-
beans. Thus, an increase in soybean prices actually affects the amount of corn supplied.
Similarly, if beef prices rise, producers may respond by raising more cattle. However, leather
comes from cowhide. Thus, an increase in beef prices may actually increase the supply of leather.
To summarize:
Assuming that its objective is to maximize profits, a firm’s decision about what quantity of
output, or product, to supply depends on:
1. The price of the good or service.
2. The cost of producing the product, which in turn depends on:
 the price of required inputs (labor, capital, and land), and
 the technologies that can be used to produce the product.
3. The prices of related products.
CHAPTER 3
Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium 63
Shift of Supply versus Movement Along a Supply Curve
A supply curve shows the relationship between the quantity of a good or service supplied by a
firm and the price that good or service brings in the market. Higher prices are likely to lead to an
increase in quantity supplied, ceteris paribus. Remember: The supply curve is derived holding
everything constant except price. When the price of a product changes ceteris paribus, a change in
the quantity supplied follows—that is, a movement along a supply curve takes place. As you
have seen, supply decisions are also influenced by factors other than price. New relationships
between price and quantity supplied come about when factors other than price change, and the
movement along a supply
curve
The change in quantity
supplied brought about by a
change in price.

result is a shift of a supply curve. When factors other than price cause supply curves to shift, we
say that there has been a change in supply.
Recall that the cost of production depends on the price of inputs and the technologies of
production available. Now suppose that a major breakthrough in the production of soybeans
has occurred: Genetic engineering has produced a superstrain of disease- and pest-resistant
seed. Such a technological change would enable individual farmers to supply more soybeans
at any market price. Table 3.4 and Figure 3.7 describe this change. At $3 a bushel, farmers
would have produced 30,000 bushels from the old seed (schedule 
in Table 3.4); with the
lower cost of production and higher yield resulting from the new seed, they produce 
40,000 bushels (schedule 
in Table 3.4). At $1.75 per bushel, they would have produced
10,000 bushels from the old seed; but with the lower costs and higher yields, output rises 
to 23,000 bushels.
Increases in input prices may also cause supply curves to shift. If Farmer Brown faces higher
fuel costs, for example, his supply curve will shift to the left—that is, he will produce less at any

given market price. If Brown’s soybean supply curve shifted far enough to the left, it would inter-
sect the price axis at a higher point, meaning that it would take a higher market price to induce
Brown to produce any soybeans at all.
As with demand, it is very important to distinguish between movements along supply curves
(changes in quantity supplied) and shifts in supply curves (changes in supply):
Change in price of a good or service leads to
Change in quantity supplied (movement along a supply curve).
Change in costs, input prices, technology, or prices of related goods and services leads to
Change in supply (shift of a supply curve).
From Individual Supply to Market Supply
Market supply is determined in the same fashion as market demand. It is simply the sum of all
that is supplied each period by all producers of a single product. Figure 3.8 derives a market sup-
ply curve from the supply curves of three individual firms. (In a market with more firms, total
market supply would be the sum of the amounts produced by each of the firms in that market.)

PART I

farm B supplies 10,000 bushels, and farm C supplies 25,000 bushels. At this price, the total
amount supplied in the market is 
, or 65,000 bushels. At a price of
$1.75, however, the total amount supplied is only 25,000 bushels (
).
Thus, the market supply curve is the simple addition of the individual supply curves of all the
firms in a particular market—that is, the sum of all the individual quantities supplied at
each price.
The position and shape of the market supply curve depends on the positions and shapes of
the individual firms’ supply curves from which it is derived. The market supply curve also
depends on the number of firms that produce in that market. If firms that produce for a par-
ticular market are earning high profits, other firms may be tempted to go into that line of busi-
ness. When the technology to produce computers for home use became available, literally
hundreds of new firms got into the act. The popularity and profitability of professional foot-
ball has, three times, led to the formation of new leagues. When new firms enter an industry,
the supply curve shifts to the right. When firms go out of business, or “exit” the market, the
supply curve shifts to the left.
Market Equilibrium
So far, we have identified a number of factors that influence the amount that households
demand and the amount that firms supply in product (output) markets. The discussion has
emphasized the role of market price as a determinant of both quantity demanded and quantity
supplied. We are now ready to see how supply and demand in the market interact to determine
the final market price.
We have been very careful in our discussions thus far to separate household decisions
about how much to demand from firm decisions about how much to supply. The operation
of the market, however, clearly depends on the interaction between suppliers and deman-
ders. At any moment, one of three conditions prevails in every market: (1) The quantity
demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at the current price, a situation called excess
demand; (2) the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the current price, a
situation called excess supply; or (3) the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at
the current price, a situation called equilibrium. At equilibrium, no tendency for price to
change exists.
Excess Demand
Excess demand, or a shortage, exists when quantity demanded is greater than quantity
supplied at the current price. Figure 3.9, which plots both a supply curve and a demand
curve on the same graph, illustrates such a situation. As you can see, market demand at 
$1.75 per bushel (50,000 bushels) exceeds the amount that farmers are currently supplying
(25,000 bushels).
When excess demand occurs in an unregulated market, there is a tendency for price to rise as
demanders compete against each other for the limited supply. The adjustment mechanisms may
differ, but the outcome is always the same. For example, consider the mechanism of an auction.
In an auction, items are sold directly to the highest bidder.When the auctioneer starts the bidding
at a low price, many people bid for the item. At first, there is a shortage: Quantity demanded
exceeds quantity supplied. As would-be buyers offer higher and higher prices, bidders drop out
until the one who offers the most ends up with the item being auctioned. Price rises until quan-
tity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.
At a price of $1.75 (see Figure 3.9 again), farmers produce soybeans at a rate of 25,000 bushels
per year, but at that price, the demand is for 50,000 bushels. Most farm products are sold to local
dealers who in turn sell large quantities in major market centers, where bidding would push prices
up if quantity demanded exceeded quantity supplied. As price rises above $1.75, two things hap-
pen: (1) The quantity demanded falls as buyers drop out of the market and perhaps choose a

substitute, and (2) the quantity supplied increases as farmers find themselves receiving a higher
price for their product and shift additional acres into soybean production.3
This process continues until the shortage is eliminated. In Figure 3.9, this occurs at
$2.50, where quantity demanded has fallen from 50,000 to 35,000 bushels per year and quan-
tity supplied has increased from 25,000 to 35,000 bushels per year. When quantity demanded
and quantity supplied are equal and there is no further bidding, the process has achieved an
equilibrium, a situation in which there is no natural tendency for further adjustment.
Graphically, the point of equilibrium is the point at which the supply curve and the demand
curve intersect.
Increasingly, items are auctioned over the Internet. Companies such as eBay connect buyers
and sellers of everything from automobiles to wine and from computers to airline tickets.
Auctions are occurring simultaneously with participants located across the globe. The principles
through which prices are determined in these auctions are the same: When excess demand exists,
prices rise.
While the principles are the same, the process through which excess demand leads to
higher prices is different in different markets. Consider the market for houses in the hypothet-
ical town of Boomville with a population of 25,000 people, most of whom live in single-family
homes. Normally, about 75 homes are sold in the Boomville market each year. However, last
year a major business opened a plant in town, creating 1,500 new jobs that pay good wages.
This attracted new residents to the area, and real estate agents now have more buyers than there
are properties for sale. Quantity demanded now exceeds quantity supplied. In other words,
there is a shortage.
Properties are sold very quickly, and housing prices begin to rise. Boomville sellers soon
learn that there are more buyers than usual, and they begin to hold out for higher offers. As

 FIGURE 3.9 Excess Demand, or Shortage
At a price of $1.75 per bushel, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied. When excess demand exists, there is a
tendency for price to rise. When quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, excess demand is eliminated and
the market is in equilibrium. Here the equilibrium price is $2.50 and the equilibrium quantity is 35,000 bushels.
3 Once farmers have produced in any given season, they cannot change their minds and produce more, of course. When we
derived Clarence Brown’s supply schedule in Table 3.3, we imagined him reacting to prices that existed at the time he decided
how much land to plant in soybeans. In Figure 3.9, the upward slope shows that higher prices justify shifting land from other
crops. Final price may not be determined until final production figures are in. For our purposes here, however, we have ignored
this timing problem. The best way to think about it is that demand and supply are flows, or rates, of production—that is, we are
talking about the number of bushels produced per production period. Adjustments in the rate of production may take place over
a number of production periods.

68
PART I
Introduction to Economics 
prices for Boomville houses rise, quantity demanded eventually drops off and quantity sup-
plied increases: (1) Encouraged by the high prices, builders begin constructing new houses,
and (2) some people, attracted by the higher prices their homes will fetch, put their houses on
the market. Discouraged by higher prices, however, some potential buyers (demanders) may
begin to look for housing in neighboring towns and settle on commuting. Eventually, equilib-
rium will be reestablished, with the quantity of houses demanded just equal to the quantity of
houses supplied.
Although the mechanics of price adjustment in the housing market differ from the mechan-
ics of an auction, the outcome is the same:
When quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, price tends to rise. When the price in
a market rises, quantity demanded falls and quantity supplied rises until an equilibrium is
reached at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.
This process is called price rationing. When a shortage exists, some people will be satisfied
and some will not. When the market operates without interference, price increases will dis-
tribute what is available to those who are willing and able to pay the most. As long as there is
a way for buyers and sellers to interact, those who are willing to pay more will make that fact
known somehow. (We discuss the nature of the price system as a rationing device in detail in
Chapter 4.)
Excess Supply
Excess supply, or a surplus, exists when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded
at the current price. As with a shortage, the mechanics of price adjustment in the face of a sur-
plus can differ from market to market. For example, if automobile dealers find themselves with
unsold cars in the fall when the new models are coming in, you can expect to see price cuts.
Sometimes dealers offer discounts to encourage buyers; sometimes buyers themselves simply
offer less than the price initially asked. In any event, products do no one any good sitting in
dealers’ lots or on warehouse shelves. The auction metaphor introduced earlier can also be
applied here: If the initial asking price is too high, no one bids and the auctioneer tries a lower
price. It is almost always true that certain items do not sell as well as anticipated during the
Christmas holidays. After Christmas, most stores have big sales during which they lower the
prices of overstocked items. Quantities supplied exceeded quantities demanded at the current
prices, so stores cut prices.
Figure 3.10 illustrates another excess supply/surplus situation. At a price of $3 per bushel,
suppose farmers are supplying soybeans at a rate of 40,000 bushels per year, but buyers are
demanding only 20,000. With 20,000 (40,000 minus 20,000) bushels of soybeans going unsold,
the market price falls. As price falls from $3.00 to $2.50, quantity supplied decreases from
40,000 bushels per year to 35,000. The lower price causes quantity demanded to rise from
20,000 to 35,000. At $2.50, quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal. For the data
shown here, $2.50 and 35,000 bushels are the equilibrium price and quantity, respectively.
Although oil prices rose to record levels in 2008, back in 2001, crude oil production
worldwide exceeded the quantity demanded and prices fell significantly as competing pro-
ducer countries tried to maintain their share of world markets. Although the mechanism by
which price is adjusted is different for automobiles, housing, soybeans, and crude oil, the out-
come is the same:
When quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded at the current price, the price tends to
fall. When price falls, quantity supplied is likely to decrease and quantity demanded is likely
to increase until an equilibrium price is reached where quantity supplied and quantity
demanded are equal.

equilibrium price to $2.40.

Changes in Equilibrium
When supply and demand curves shift, the equilibrium price and quantity change. The following
example will help to illustrate this point.
South America is a major producer of coffee beans. A cold snap there can reduce the coffee
harvest enough to affect the world price of coffee beans. In the mid-1990s, a major freeze hit
Brazil and Colombia and drove up the price of coffee on world markets to a record $2.40 per
pound. Severe hurricanes in the Caribbean caused a similar shift of supply in 2005.
Figure 3.11 illustrates how the freeze pushed up coffee prices.Initially,the market was in equilib-
rium at a price of $1.20.At that price,the quantity demanded was equal to quantity supplied (13.2 bil-
lion pounds). At a price of $1.20 and a quantity of 13.2 billion pounds,the demand curve (labeled D)
intersected the initial supply curve (labeled 
). (Remember that equilibrium exists when quantity
demanded equals quantity supplied—the point at which the supply and demand curves intersect.)
The freeze caused a decrease in the supply of coffee beans. That is, the freeze caused the sup-
ply curve to shift to the left. In Figure 3.11, the new supply curve (the supply curve that shows the
relationship between price and quantity supplied after the freeze) is labeled 
.
At the initial equilibrium price, $1.20, there is now a shortage of coffee. If the price were to
remain at $1.20, quantity demanded would not change; it would remain at 13.2 billion pounds.
S1

70
PART I
Introduction to Economics 
However, at that price, quantity supplied would drop to 6.6 billion pounds. At a price of $1.20,
quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied.
When excess demand exists in a market, price can be expected to rise, and rise it did. As the
figure shows, price rose to a new equilibrium at $2.40. At $2.40, quantity demanded is again
equal to quantity supplied, this time at 9.9 billion pounds—the point at which the new supply
curve (
) intersects the demand curve.
Notice that as the price of coffee rose from $1.20 to $2.40, two things happened. First, the
quantity demanded declined (a movement along the demand curve) as people shifted to substi-
tutes such as tea and hot cocoa. Second, the quantity supplied began to rise, but within the limits
imposed by the damage from the freeze. (It might also be that some countries or areas with high
costs of production, previously unprofitable, came into production and shipped to the world mar-
ket at the higher price.) That is, the quantity supplied increased in response to the higher price
along the new supply curve, which lies to the left of the old supply curve. The final result was a
higher price ($2.40), a smaller quantity finally exchanged in the market (9.9 billion pounds), and
coffee bought only by those willing to pay $2.40 per pound.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
High Prices for Tomatoes
The winter of 2010 was a very cold one for Florida, where much of the
U.S. fresh fruit and vegetable supply is produced. The article below
describes the effect on the price of fresh tomatoes resulting from the
freeze. With fewer tomatoes around (the supply curve shifted left due
to the freeze), the price of tomatoes increased fivefold. What the
reporter calls a shortage, we economists simply note as a shift in the
supply curve!
Note the interesting comment by Mr. Brown, the executive vice
president of the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange, when people
complained to him about the high price of tomatoes. “Doesn’t mat-
ter,” he opined, “because there isn’t anything to sell.” It is precisely
because there is less to sell that the price has in fact risen!
Tomatoes Get Sliced From Menus
The Wall Street Journal
A shortage of tomatoes from weather-battered Florida 
is forcing restaurants and supermarkets to ration supplies amid
soaring prices for America’s most popular fresh vegetable.
Fast-food restaurant chains such as Wendy’s have
stopped automatically including tomatoes in sandwiches; now
customers have to know to ask.
Even then, consumers might not get what they usually do.
At Lloyd’s, a white-table cloth restaurant across the street
from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, signs went up this
week warning that only plum tomatoes are available.
“People love having tomatoes in their salad and in
sandwiches, but we want people to know ahead of time
that the quality just isn’t what they are used to,” said 
Sam Berngard, president of Taste America Restaurant
Group LLC, which operates Lloyd’s and two Chicago
seafood restaurants.
Subway is continuing to offer tomatoes on its sand-
wiches, but the chain is using different varieties to ensure that
it has enough on hand.
Fresh tomatoes are in short supply because of the
unusual spell of freezing temperatures that hugged Florida
in January. The cold temperatures that dented citrus pro-
duction also destroyed roughly 70% of the tomato crop in
Florida, which is the largest source of U.S.-grown fresh
tomatoes this time of year.
Reggie Brown, executive vice president of Florida Tomato
Growers Exchange, a Maitland, Florida, trade group, said
Tuesday that a 25-pound box of tomatoes is trading for $30,
compared with $6.45 a year ago.
Some restaurants have been told they would have to
spend up to $45 for a box of tomatoes in recent days.
“Doesn’t matter though, because there isn’t anything to sell,”
said Mr. Brown, who calculates the state’s shipments are
running at about 30% of normal.

 FIGURE 3.12 Examples of Supply and Demand Shifts for Product X
Since many market prices are driven by the interaction of millions of buyers and sellers, it is
often difficult to predict how they will change. A series of events in the mid-1990s led to the left-
ward shift in supply, thus driving up the price of coffee, but the opposite occurred more recently.
Today coffee beans are exported by over 50 countries, with Brazil being the largest producer with
about 30 percent of the market. Large increases in production have kept prices low. In July 2007,
the average price per pound was $1.06.
Figure 3.12 summarizes the possible supply and demand shifts that have been discussed and
the resulting changes in equilibrium price and quantity. Study the graphs carefully to ensure that

Introduction to Economics 
Demand and Supply in Product Markets: 
A Review
As you continue your study of economics, you will discover that it is a discipline full of
controversy and debate. There is, however, little disagreement about the basic way that
the forces of supply and demand operate in free markets. If you hear that a freeze in Florida
has destroyed a good portion of the citrus crop, you can bet that the price of oranges
will rise. If you read that the weather in the Midwest has been good and a record corn
crop is expected, you can bet that corn prices will fall. When fishermen in Massachusetts go
on strike and stop bringing in the daily catch, you can bet that the price of local fish will
go up.
Here are some important points to remember about the mechanics of supply and demand in
product markets:
1. A demand curve shows how much of a product a household would buy if it could buy all it
wanted at the given price. A supply curve shows how much of a product a firm would sup-
ply if it could sell all it wanted at the given price.
2. Quantity demanded and quantity supplied are always per time period—that is, per day, per
month, or per year.
3. The demand for a good is determined by price, household income and wealth, prices of
other goods and services, tastes and preferences, and expectations.
4. The supply of a good is determined by price, costs of production, and prices of related
products. Costs of production are determined by available technologies of production and
input prices.
5. Be careful to distinguish between movements along supply and demand curves and
shifts of these curves. When the price of a good changes, the quantity of that good
demanded or supplied changes—that is, a movement occurs along the curve. When any
other factor changes, the curve shifts, or changes position.
6. Market equilibrium exists only when quantity supplied equals quantity demanded at the
current price.
Looking Ahead: Markets and the Allocation
of Resources
You can already begin to see how markets answer the basic economic questions of what is pro-
duced, how it is produced, and who gets what is produced. A firm will produce what is prof-
itable to produce. If the firm can sell a product at a price that is sufficient to ensure a profit
after production costs are paid, it will in all likelihood produce that product. Resources will
flow in the direction of profit opportunities.
 Demand curves reflect what people are willing and able to pay for products; demand
curves are influenced by incomes, wealth, preferences, prices of other goods, and
expectations. Because product prices are determined by the interaction of supply and
demand, prices reflect what people are willing to pay. If people’s preferences or incomes
change, resources will be allocated differently. Consider, for example, an increase 
in demand—a shift in the market demand curve. Beginning at an equilibrium,
households simply begin buying more. At the equilibrium price, quantity demanded
becomes greater than quantity supplied. When there is excess demand, prices will rise,
and higher prices mean higher profits for firms in the industry. Higher profits, in turn,

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Why Do the Prices of Newspapers Rise?
In 2006, the average price for a daily edition of a Baltimore newspa-
per was $0.50. In 2007, the average price had risen to $0.75. Three
different analysts have three different explanations for the higher
equilibrium price.
Analyst 1: The higher price for Baltimore newspapers is good
news because it means the population is better informed about
public issues. These data clearly show that the citizens of
Baltimore have a new, increased regard for newspapers.
Analyst 2: The higher price for Baltimore newspapers is bad
news for the citizens of Baltimore. The higher cost of paper, ink,
and distribution reflected in these higher prices will further
diminish the population’s awareness of public issues.
Analyst 3: The higher price for Baltimore newspapers is an
unfortunate result of newspapers trying to make money as many
consumers have turned to the Internet to access news coverage
for free.
As economists, we are faced with two tasks in looking at these
explanations: Do they make sense based on what we know about
economic principles? And if they do make sense, can we figure out
which explanation applies to the case of rising newspaper prices
in Baltmore?
What is Analyst 1 saying? Her observation about consumers’
new increased regard for newspapers tells us something about the
demand curve. Analyst 1 seems to be arguing that tastes have
changed in favor of newspapers, which would mean a shift in the
demand curve to the right. With upward-sloping supply, such a
shift would produce a price increase. So Analyst 1’s story 
is plausible.
Analyst 2 refers to an increased cost of newsprint. This would
cause production costs of newspapers to rise, shifting the supply
curve to the left. A downward-sloping demand curve also results in
increased prices. So Analyst 2 also has a plausible story.
Since Analyst 1 and Analyst 2 have plausible stories based on
economic principles, we can look at evidence to see who is in fact
right. If you go back to the graphs in Figure 3.12 on p. 71, you will
find a clue. When demand shifts to the right (as in Analyst 1’s story)
the price rises, but so does the quantity as shown in Figure (a).
When supply shifts to the left (as in Analyst 2’s story) the price
rises, but the quantity falls as shown in Figure (b). So we would
look at what happened to newspaper circulation during this period
to see whether the price increase is from the demand side or the
supply side. In fact, in most markets, including Baltimore, quanti-
ties of newspapers bought have been falling, so Analyst 2 is most
likely correct.
But be careful. Both analysts may be correct. If demand shifts to
the right and supply shifts to the left by a greater amount, the price
will rise and the quantity sold will fall.
What about Analyst 3? Analyst 3 clearly never had an economics
course! Free Internet access to news is a substitute for print media. A
decrease in the price of this substitute should shift the demand for
newspapers to the left. The result should be a lower price, not a price
increase. The fact that the newspaper publishers are “trying to make
money”faced with this new competition does not change the laws of
supply and demand.

1. In societies with many people, production must satisfy
wide-ranging tastes and preferences, and producers must
therefore specialize.
FIRMS AND HOUSEHOLDS: THE BASIC DECISION-
MAKING UNITS p. 47
2. A firm exists when a person or a group of people decides to
produce a product or products by transforming resources, or
inputs, into outputs—the products that are sold in the mar-
ket. Firms are the primary producing units in a market
economy. We assume that firms make decisions to try to
maximize profits.
3. Households are the primary consuming units in an economy.
All households’ incomes are subject to constraints.
INPUT MARKETS AND OUTPUT MARKETS: THE
CIRCULAR FLOW  p. 48 
4. Households and firms interact in two basic kinds of
markets: product or output markets and input or factor
markets. Goods and services intended for use by house-
holds are exchanged in output markets. In output
markets, competing firms supply and competing house-
holds demand. In input markets, competing firms
demand and competing households supply.
5. Ultimately, firms choose the quantities and character 
of outputs produced, the types and quantities of inputs
demanded, and the technologies used in production.
Households choose the types and quantities of pro-
ducts demanded and the types and quantities of
inputs supplied.
DEMAND IN PRODUCT/OUTPUT MARKETS  p. 50 
6. The quantity demanded of an individual product by an indi-
vidual household depends on (1) price, (2) income, (3) wealth,
(4) prices of other products, (5) tastes and preferences, and 
(6) expectations about the future.
7. Quantity demanded is the amount of a product that an indi-
vidual household would buy in a given period if it could buy
all that it wanted at the current price.
8. A demand schedule shows the quantities of a product 
that a household would buy at different prices. The 
same information can be presented graphically in a
demand curve.
provide existing firms with an incentive to expand and new firms with an incentive 
to enter the industry. Thus, the decisions of independent private firms responding to
prices and profit opportunities determine what will be produced. No central direction 
is necessary.
Adam Smith saw this self-regulating feature of markets more than 200 years ago:
Every individual . . . by pursuing his own interest . . . promotes that of society. He is led . . .
by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.4
The term Smith coined, the invisible hand, has passed into common parlance and is still used
by economists to refer to the self-regulation of markets.
 Firms in business to make a profit have a good reason to choose the best available technology—
lower costs mean higher profits. Thus, individual firms determine how to produce their prod-
ucts, again with no central direction.
 So far, we have barely touched on the question of distribution—who gets what is produced?
You can see part of the answer in the simple supply and demand diagrams. When a good is in
short supply, price rises. As they do, those who are willing and able to continue buying do so;
others stop buying.
The next chapter begins with a more detailed discussion of these topics. How, exactly, is the
final allocation of resources (the mix of output and the distribution of output) determined in a
market system?
4 Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Modern Library Edition (New York: Random House, 1937), p. 456 (1st ed., 1776).

CHAPTER 3
Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium 75
9. The law of demand states that there is a negative relationship
between price and quantity demanded: As price rises, quan-
tity demanded decreases and vice versa. Demand curves
slope downward.
10. All demand curves eventually intersect the price axis because
there is always a price above which a household cannot or
will not pay. Also, all demand curves eventually intersect the
quantity axis because demand for most goods is limited, if
only by time, even at a zero price.
11. When an increase in income causes demand for a good to
rise, that good is a normal good. When an increase in
income causes demand for a good to fall, that good is an
inferior good.
12. If a rise in the price of good X causes demand for good Y to
increase, the goods are substitutes. If a rise in the price of
X causes demand for Y to fall, the goods are complements.
13. Market demand is simply the sum of all the quantities of
a good or service demanded per period by all the house-
holds buying in the market for that good or service. It is
the sum of all the individual quantities demanded at 
each price.
SUPPLY IN PRODUCT/OUTPUT MARKETS  p. 60 
14. Quantity supplied by a firm depends on (1) the price of the
good or service; (2) the cost of producing the product, which
includes the prices of required inputs and the technologies
that can be used to produce the product; and (3) the prices
of related products.
15. Market supply is the sum of all that is supplied in 
each period by all producers of a single product. It is 
the sum of all the individual quantities supplied at 
each price.
16. It is very important to distinguish between movements
along demand and supply curves and shifts of demand
and supply curves. The demand curve shows the rela-
tionship between price and quantity demanded. The
supply curve shows the relationship between price and
quantity supplied. A change in price is a movement along
the curve. Changes in tastes, income, wealth, expectations,
or prices of other goods and services cause demand
curves to shift; changes in costs, input prices, technology,
or prices of related goods and services cause supply
curves to shift.
MARKET EQUILIBRIUM p. 66 
17. When quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied at the
current price, excess demand (or a shortage) exists and the
price tends to rise. When prices in a market rise, quantity
demanded falls and quantity supplied rises until an equilib-
rium is reached at which quantity supplied and quantity
demanded are equal. At equilibrium, there is no further ten-
dency for price to change.
18. When quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded at the
current price, excess supply (or a surplus) exists and the price
tends to fall. When price falls, quantity supplied decreases
and quantity demanded increases until an equilibrium price
is reached where quantity supplied and quantity demanded
are equal.

1. Illustrate the following with supply and demand curves:
a. With increased access to wireless technology and lighter
weight, the demand for laptop computers has increased sub-
stantially. Laptops have also become easier and cheaper to
produce as new technology has come online. Despite the
shift of demand, prices have fallen.
b. Cranberry production in Massachusetts totaled 2.37 million
barrels in 2008, a 56 percent increase from the 1.52 million
barrels produced in 2007. Demand increased by even more
than supply, pushing 2008 prices to $56.70 per barrel from
$49.80 in 2007.
c. During the high-tech boom in the late 1990s, San Jose office
space was in very high demand and rents were very high.
With the national recession that began in March 2001, how-
ever, the market for office space in San Jose (Silicon Valley)
was hit very hard, with rents per square foot falling. In 2005,
the employment numbers from San Jose were rising slowly
and rents began to rise again. Assume for simplicity that no
new office space was built during the period.
d. Before economic reforms were implemented in the coun-
tries of Eastern Europe, regulation held the price of bread
substantially below equilibrium. When reforms were
implemented, prices were deregulated and the price of
bread rose dramatically. As a result, the quantity of bread
demanded fell and the quantity of bread supplied 
rose sharply.
e. The steel industry has been lobbying for high taxes on
imported steel. Russia, Brazil, and Japan have been produc-
ing and selling steel on world markets at $610 per metric
ton, well below what equilibrium would be in the United
States with no imports. If no imported steel was permitted
into the country, the equilibrium price would be $970 per
metric ton. Show supply and demand curves for the United
States, assuming no imports; then show what the graph
would look like if U.S. buyers could purchase all the steel
that they wanted from world markets at $610 per metric
ton; show the quantity of imported steel.
2. On Sunday, August 19, the Detroit Tigers and the New York
Yankees played baseball at Yankee Stadium. Both teams were in
pursuit of league championships. Tickets to the game were sold
out, and many more fans would have attended if additional
tickets had been available. On that same day, the Cleveland
Indians and the Tampa Bay Rays played each other and sold
tickets to only 22,500 people in Tampa.
The Rays stadium, Tropicana Field, holds 43,772. Yankee
Stadium holds 57,478. Assume for simplicity that tickets to all
regular-season games are priced at $40.
a. Draw supply and demand curves for the tickets to each of
the two games. (Hint: Supply is fixed. It does not change
with price.) Draw one graph for each game.
b. Is there a pricing policy that would have filled the ballpark
for the Tampa game? If the Rays adopted such a strategy,
would it bring in more or less revenue?
c. The price system was not allowed to work to ration the
New York tickets when they were initially sold to the
public. How do you know? How do you suppose the tickets
were rationed?

3. During the last 10 years, Orlando, Florida, grew rapidly,
with new jobs luring young people into the area. Despite
increases in population and income growth that expanded
demand for housing, the price of existing houses barely
increased. Why? Illustrate your answer with supply and
demand curves.
4. Do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements?
Briefly explain your answers and illustrate each with supply and
demand curves.
a. The price of a good rises, causing the demand for another
good to fall. Therefore, the two goods are substitutes.
b. A shift in supply causes the price of a good to fall. The shift
must have been an increase in supply.
c. During 2009, incomes fell sharply for many Americans. This
change would likely lead to a decrease in the prices of both
normal and inferior goods.
d. Two normal goods cannot be substitutes for each other.
e. If demand increases and supply increases at the same time,
price will clearly rise.
f. The price of good A falls. This causes an increase in the price
of good B. Therefore, goods A and B are complements.
5. The U.S. government administers two programs that affect the
market for cigarettes. Media campaigns and labeling require-
ments are aimed at making the public aware of the health dan-
gers of cigarettes. At the same time, the Department of
Agriculture maintains price supports for tobacco. Under this
program, the supported price is above the market equilibrium
price and the government limits the amount of land that can be
devoted to tobacco production. Are these two programs at odds
with the goal of reducing cigarette consumption? As part of
your answer, illustrate graphically the effects of both policies on
the market for cigarettes.
6. During the period 2006 through 2010, housing production in
the United States fell from a rate of over 2.27 million housing
starts per year to a rate of under 500,000, a decrease of over 
80 percent. At the same time, the number of new households
slowed to a trickle. Students without a job moved in with their
parents, fewer immigrants came to the United States, and
more of those already here went home. If there are fewer
households, it is a decline in demand. If fewer new units are
built, it is a decline in supply.
a. Draw a standard supply and demand diagram which shows
the demand for new housing units that are purchased each
month, and the supply of new units built and put on the
market each month. Assume that the quantity supplied and
quantity demanded are equal at 45,000 units and at a price
of $200,000.
b. On the same diagram show a decline in demand. What
would happen if this market behaved like most markets?
c. Now suppose that prices did not change immediately. Sellers
decided not to adjust price even though demand is below
supply. What would happen to the number of homes for sale
(the inventory of unsold new homes) if prices stayed the
same following the drop in demand?

CHAPTER 3    Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium 77
d. Now supposed that the supply of new homes put on the
market dropped, but price still stayed the same at $200,000.
Can you tell a story that brings the market back to equilib-
rium without a drop in price?
e. Go to www.census.gov/newhomesales. Look at the current
press release, which contains data for the most recent month
and the past year. What trends can you observe?
7. The following sets of statements contain common errors.
Identify and explain each error:
a. Demand increases, causing prices to rise. Higher prices 
cause demand to fall. Therefore, prices fall back to their
original levels.
b. The supply of meat in Russia increases, causing meat prices
to fall. Lower prices always mean that Russian households
spend more on meat.
8. For each of the following statements, draw a diagram that
illustrates the likely effect on the market for eggs. Indicate 
in each case the impact on equilibrium price and equilib-
rium quantity.
a. A surgeon general warns that high-cholesterol foods cause
heart attacks.
b. The price of bacon, a complementary product, decreases.
c. An increase in the price of chicken feed occurs.
d. Caesar salads become trendy at dinner parties. (The dressing
is made with raw eggs.)
e. A technological innovation reduces egg breakage 
during packing.
*9. Suppose the demand and supply curves for eggs in the United
States are given by the following equations:
where 
of dozens of eggs Americans would like to
buy each year;
of dozens of eggs U.S. farms
would like to sell each year; and 
per dozen of eggs.
a. Fill in the following table:
P = price
Qs = millions
Qd = millions
 Qs = 10 + 40P
 Qd = 100 - 20P
b. Critics of housing vouchers (the demand-side strategy)
argue that because the supply of housing to low-income
households is limited and does not respond to higher rents,
demand vouchers will serve only to drive up rents and make
landlords better off. Illustrate their point with supply and
demand curves.

what price?
c. What would happen if suppliers set the price of pizza at $15?
Explain the market adjustment process.
d. Suppose the price of hamburgers, a substitute for pizza,

c. Graph the demand and supply curves and identify the equi-

*10. Housing policy analysts debate the best way to increase the
number of housing units available to low-income households.
One strategy—the demand-side strategy—is to provide people
with housing vouchers, paid for by the government, that can be
used to rent housing supplied by the private market. Another—
a supply-side strategy—is to have the government subsidize
housing suppliers or to build public housing.
a. Illustrate supply- and demand-side strategies using supply
and demand curves. Which results in higher rents?
12. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 70] In the winter,
which is the peak season for coats, the price of coats is typically
higher than it is in the summer. In the case of strawberries,
however, the reverse is true: The price of strawberries is lower in
the peak season than it is in the winter season. How do we
explain this seeming contradiction?
13. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 73] Analyst 1 sug-
gested that the demand curve for newspapers in Baltimore
might have shifted to the right because people were becoming
more literate. Think of two other plausible stories that would
result in this demand curve shifting to the right.
14. Explain whether each of the following statements describes a
change in demand or a change in quantity demanded, and spec-
ify whether each change represents an increase or a decrease.
a. Baby Steps Footwear experiences a 40 percent increase in
sales of baby shoes during a 3-day, half-price sale.
b. Tabitha gets a promotion and 15 percent increase in her
salary and decides to reward herself by purchasing a new 
3-D television.
c. When the price of peaches unexpectedly rises, many con-
sumers choose to purchase plums instead.
d. Due to potential problems with its breaking system, Asteriod
Motors has experienced a decline in sales of its Galactica
automobile.
e. Antonio, an accountant working for the city of Santa Cristina,
decides to forego his annual vacation to Hawaii when word
leaks out that the city may be cutting all employees’ salaries by
10 percent at the end of the year.
15. For each of the five statements (a–e) in the previous question,
draw a demand graph representing the appropriate change in
quantity demanded or change in demand.
16. Until 2008, General Motors held the title of the world’s largest
automobile manufacturer for 78 years. The recession of
2007–2009 and its accompanying financial crisis saw GM
declare bankruptcy, receive over $50 billion in government
bailout funds, and experience a significant decrease in demand

CHAPTER OUTLINE
Every society has a system of institutions that determines what is produced, how it is produced,
and who gets what is produced. In some societies, these decisions are made centrally, through
planning agencies or by government directive. However, in every society, many decisions are
made in a decentralized way, through the operation of markets.
Markets exist in all societies, and Chapter 3 provided a bare-bones description of how markets
operate. In this chapter, we continue our examination of demand, supply, and the price system.
The Price System: Rationing and Allocating
Resources
The market system, also called the price system, performs two important and closely related func-
tions. First, it provides an automatic mechanism for distributing scarce goods and services. That is,
it serves as a price rationing device for allocating goods and services to consumers when the quan-
tity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. Second, the price system ultimately determines both
the allocation of resources among producers and the final mix of outputs.
Price Rationing
Consider the simple process by which the price system eliminates a shortage. Figure 4.1 shows
hypothetical supply and demand curves for wheat. Wheat is produced around the world, with
large supplies coming from Russia and from the United States. Wheat is sold in a world market
and used to produce a range of food products, from cereals and breads to processed foods, which
line the kitchens of the average consumer. Wheat is thus demanded by large food companies as
they produce breads, cereals, and cake for households.
As Figure 4.1 shows, the equilibrium price of wheat was $160 per millions of metric tons in
the spring of 2010. At this price, farmers from around the world were expected to bring 61.7 mil-
lion metric tons to market. Supply and demand were equal. Market equilibrium existed at a price
of $160 per millions of metric tons because at that price, quantity demanded was equal to quan-
tity supplied. (Remember that equilibrium occurs at the point where the supply and demand
curves intersect. In Figure 4.1, this occurs at point C.)
In the summer of 2010, Russia experienced its warmest summer on record. Fires swept
through Russia, destroying a substantial portion of the Russia wheat crop. With almost a third of
the world wheat normally produced in Russia, the effect of this environmental disaster on world

 FIGURE 4.1 The Market for Wheat
Fires in Russia in the summer of 2010 caused a shift in the world's supply of wheat to the left, causing the
price to increase from $160 per millions of metric tons to $247. The equilibrium moved from C to B.
wheat supply was substantial. In the figure, the supply curve for wheat, which had been drawn in
expectation of harvesting all the wheat planted in Russia along with the rest of the world, now
shifted to the left, from Sspring 2010 to Sfall 2010. This shift in the supply curve created a situation of
excess demand at the old price of $160. At that price, the quantity demanded is 61.7 million
metric tons but the burning of much of the Russia supply left the world with only 35 millions of
metric tons expected to be supplied. Quantity demanded exceeded quantity supplied at the orig-
inal price by 26.7 million metric tons.
The reduced supply caused the price of wheat to rise sharply.As the price rises, the available sup-
ply is “rationed.” Those who are willing and able to pay the most get it. You can see the market’s
rationing function clearly in Figure 4.1. As the price rises from $160, the quantity demanded declines
along the demand curve,moving from point C (61.7 million tons) toward point B (41.5 million tons).
The higher prices mean that prices for products like Pepperidge Farm bread and Shredded Wheat
cereal, which use wheat as an essential ingredient, also rise. People bake fewer cakes, and begin to eat
more rye bread and switch from Shredded Wheat to Corn Flakes in response to the price changes.
As prices rise, wheat farmers also change their behavior, though supply responsiveness is limited
in the short term. Farmers outside of Russia, seeing the price rise, harvest their crops more carefully,
getting more precious grains from each stalk. Perhaps some wheat is taken out of storage and
brought to market.Quantity supplied increases from 35 million metric tons (point A) to 41.5 million
tons (point B). The price increase has encouraged farmers who can to make up for part of the Russia
wheat loss.
A new equilibrium is established at a price of $247 per millions of metric tons, with 41.5 mil-
lion tons transacted. The market has determined who gets the wheat: The lower total supply is
rationed to those who are willing and able to pay the higher price.
This idea of “willingness to pay”is central to the distribution of available supply, and willing-
ness depends on both desire (preferences) and income/wealth. Willingness to pay does not neces-
sarily mean that only the very rich will continue to buy wheat when the price increases. For
anyone to continue to buy wheat at a higher price, his or her enjoyment comes at a higher cost in
terms of other goods and services.
In sum:
The adjustment of price is the rationing mechanism in free markets. Price rationing means
that whenever there is a need to ration a good—that is, when a shortage exists—in a free
market, the price of the good will rise until quantity supplied equals quantity demanded—
that is, until the market clears.

there would be an enormous excess demand for such an important painting. The price would
be bid up until there was only one remaining demander. Presumably, that price would be very
high. In fact, the Pollock painting sold for a record $140 million in 2006. If the product is in
strictly scarce supply, as a single painting is, its price is said to be demand-determined. That is,
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Prices and Total Expenditure: A Lesson From the Lobster
Industry in 2008–2009
It is very important to distinguish between the price of a product and
total expenditure from that product.A recent report on the lobster mar-
ket in New England shows how it can be confusing. See if you can fig-
ure out what happened to the price and quantity of lobsters trapped in
Maine between 2008 and 2009.
The following short passage was taken from an Associated Press
article dated March 1, 2010.
Lobster Prices Plummet As Maine Fisherman
Catch Way Too Many
Business Insider
PORTLAND, Maine (AP)—Officials say Maine lobstermen had
a record harvest in 2009, but the value of the catch continued
to plunge amid the sour global economy.
The Department of Marine Resources announced
Monday that lobstermen caught 75.6 million pounds last
year, up 8 percent from 2008. But the value of the catch fell
$23 million, to $221.7 million.

Total revenue or expenditure in a market is simply the number of
units sold multiplied by the price. The author of this article seems
surprised that the total revenue in the lobster business (or value as
he calls it) has fallen despite an increase in the catch. But of course,
when supply curves shift right, as has happened here, prices typically
fall, unless something has simultaneously happened to shift the
demand curve. With an increase in volume and a decrease in price,
total revenue could go up or down. In 2009, in the lobster market,
revenue apparently fell.
Incidentally, the data given in the article allows you to find
prices for 2008 and 2009 as well as quantities. (The price in 2008
was $3.50 and in 2009, $2.93.) Make sure you see how these num-
bers are derived.

Introduction to Economics
its price is determined solely and exclusively by the amount that the highest bidder or highest
bidders are willing to pay.
One might interpret the statement that “there is some price that will clear any market” to
mean “everything has its price,” but that is not exactly what it means. Suppose you own a small
silver bracelet that has been in your family for generations. It is quite possible that you would
not sell it for any amount of money. Does this mean that the market is not working, or that
quantity supplied and quantity demanded are not equal? Not at all. It simply means that you
are the highest bidder. By turning down all bids, you must be willing to forgo what anybody
offers for it.
Constraints on the Market and Alternative Rationing
Mechanisms
On occasion,both governments and private firms decide to use some mechanism other than the mar-
ket system to ration an item for which there is excess demand at the current price. Policies designed to
stop price rationing are commonly justified in a number of ways.
The rationale most often used is fairness. It is not “fair”to let landlords charge high rents, not
fair for oil companies to run up the price of gasoline, not fair for insurance companies to charge
enormous premiums, and so on. After all, the argument goes, we have no choice but to pay—
housing and insurance are necessary, and one needs gasoline to get to work. Although it is not
precisely true that price rationing allocates goods and services solely on the basis of income and
wealth, income and wealth do constrain our wants. Why should all the gasoline or all the tickets
to the World Series go just to the rich?
Various schemes to keep price from rising to equilibrium are based on several percep-
tions of injustice, among them (1) that price-gouging is bad, (2) that income is unfairly
distributed, and (3) that some items are necessities and everyone should be able to buy them
at a “reasonable” price. Regardless of the rationale, the following examples will make two
things clear:
1. Attempts to bypass price rationing in the market and to use alternative rationing devices are
more difficult and more costly than they would seem at first glance.
2. Very often such attempts distribute costs and benefits among households in unintended ways.
Oil, Gasoline, and OPEC
One of the most important prices in the world is the price of crude
oil. Millions of barrels of oil are traded every day. It is a major input into virtually every product pro-
duced. It heats our homes, and it is used to produce the gasoline that runs our cars. Its production has
led to massive environmental disasters as well as wars. Its price has fluctuated wildly, leading to major
macroeconomic problems.But oil is like other commodities in that its price is determined by the
basic forces of supply and demand. Oil provides a good example of how markets work and how
markets sometimes fail.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is an organization of twelve
countries (Algeria,Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, and Venezuela) that together controlled about one-third of the known supply of oil in
the year 2010. In 1973 and 1974, OPEC imposed an embargo on shipments of crude oil to the
United States. What followed was a drastic reduction in the quantity of gasoline available at
local gas pumps.
Had the market system been allowed to operate, refined gasoline prices would have
increased dramatically until quantity supplied was equal to quantity demanded. However, the
government decided that rationing gasoline only to those who were willing and able to pay the
most was unfair, and Congress imposed a price ceiling, or maximum price, of $0.57 per gallon
of leaded regular gasoline. That price ceiling was intended to keep gasoline “affordable,” but it
also perpetuated the shortage. At the restricted price, quantity demanded remained greater

means of distributing goods
and services: a nonprice

1 You can also show formally that the result is inefficient—that there is a resulting net loss of total value to society. First, there
is the cost of waiting in line. Time has a value. With price rationing, no one has to wait in line and the value of that time is
saved. Second, there may be additional lost value if the gasoline ends up in the hands of someone who places a lower value on
it than someone else who gets no gas. Suppose, for example, that the market price of gasoline if unconstrained would rise to
$2 but that the government has it fixed at $1. There will be long lines to get gas. Imagine that to motorist A, 10 gallons of gas
is worth $35 but that she fails to get gas because her time is too valuable to wait in line. To motorist B, 10 gallons is worth
only $15, but his time is worth much less, so he gets the gas. In the end, A could pay B for the gas and both would be better
off. If A pays B $30 for the gas, A is $5 better off and B is $15 better off. In addition, A does not have to wait in line. Thus, the
allocation that results from nonprice rationing involves a net loss of value. Such losses are called deadweight losses. See p. 92
of this chapter.

In 1974, a ceiling price of $0.57 cents per gallon of leaded regular gasoline was imposed. If the price had
been set by the interaction of supply and demand instead, it would have increased to approximately 
$1.50 per gallon. At $0.57 per gallon, the quantity demanded exceeded the quantity supplied. Because the
price system was not allowed to function, an alternative rationing system had to be found to distribute the
available supply of gasoline.
than quantity supplied, and the available gasoline had to be divided up somehow among all
potential demanders.
You can see the effects of the price ceiling by looking carefully at Figure 4.3. If the price had
been set by the interaction of supply and demand, it would have increased to approximately 
$1.50 per gallon. Instead, Congress made it illegal to sell gasoline for more than $0.57 per gallon.
At that price, quantity demanded exceeded quantity supplied and a shortage existed. Because the
price system was not allowed to function, an alternative rationing system had to be found to dis-
tribute the available supply of gasoline.
Several devices were tried. The most common of all nonprice rationing systems is queuing, a
term that means waiting in line. During 1974, very long lines formed daily at gas stations, starting as
early as 5 A.M. Under this system, gasoline went to those people who were willing to pay the most, but
the sacrifice was measured in hours and aggravation instead of dollars.1

84
PART I
Introduction to Economics
A second nonprice rationing device used during the gasoline crisis was that of favored
customers. Many gas station owners decided not to sell gasoline to the general public, but to
reserve their scarce supplies for friends and favored customers. Not surprisingly, many customers
tried to become “favored” by offering side payments to gas station owners. Owners also charged
high prices for service. By doing so, they increased the real price of gasoline but hid it in service
overcharges to get around the ceiling.
Yet another method of dividing up available supply is the use of ration coupons. It was sug-
gested in both 1974 and 1979 that families be given ration tickets or coupons that would entitle
them to purchase a certain number of gallons of gasoline each month. That way, everyone would
get the same amount regardless of income. Such a system had been employed in the United States
during the 1940s when wartime price ceilings on meat, sugar, butter, tires, nylon stockings, and
many other items were imposed.
When ration coupons are used with no prohibition against trading them, however, the result
is almost identical to a system of price rationing. Those who are willing and able to pay the most
buy up the coupons and use them to purchase gasoline, chocolate, fresh eggs, or anything else
that is sold at a restricted price.2 This means that the price of the restricted good will effectively
rise to the market-clearing price. For instance, suppose that you decide not to sell your ration
coupon. You are then forgoing what you would have received by selling the coupon. Thus, the
“real” price of the good you purchase will be higher (if only in opportunity cost) than the
restricted price. Even when trading coupons is declared illegal, it is virtually impossible to
stop black markets from developing. In a black market, illegal trading takes place at market-
determined prices.
Rationing Mechanisms for Concert and Sports Tickets
Tickets for sporting
events such as the World Series, the Super Bowl, and the World Cup command huge prices in the
open market. In many cases, the prices are substantially above the original issue price. One of the
hottest basketball tickets ever was one to the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers’ NBA final
series in 2010 that LA won in seven games. The online price for a courtside seat to one of the
games in Los Angeles was $19,000. On September 16, 2007, Justin Timberlake performed at the
Staples Center in Los Angeles. The day before the concert, you could buy a front row ticket for
$16,000 on the StubHub Web site.
You might ask why a profit-maximizing enterprise would not charge the highest price it
could? The answer depends on the event. If the Chicago Cubs got into the World Series, the peo-
ple of Chicago would buy all the tickets available for thousands of dollars each. But if the Cubs
actually charged $2,000 a ticket, the hard-working fans would be furious: “Greedy Cubs Gouge
Fans” the headlines would scream. Ordinary loyal fans earning reasonable salaries would not be
able to afford those prices. Next season, perhaps some of those irate fans would change loyalties,
supporting the White Sox over the Cubs. In part to keep from alienating loyal fans, prices for
championship games are held down. But not every concert promoter or sports team behaves this
way. In 2000, Barbra Streisand gave a concert in Sydney, Australia. Tickets were issued with a face
value of $1,530, a record for a concert that still stands today.
Let’s consider a concert at the Staples Center, which has 20,000 seats. The supply of tick-
ets is thus fixed at 20,000. Of course, there are good seats and bad seats, but to keep things
simple, let’s assume that all seats are the same and that the promoters charge $50 per ticket
for all tickets. This is illustrated in Figure 4.4. Supply is represented by a vertical line at

20,000. Changing the price does not change the supply of seats. In the figure the quantity
demanded at the price of $50 is 38,000, so at this price there is excess demand of 18,000.
Who would get to buy the $50 tickets? As in the case of gasoline, a variety of rationing
mechanisms might be used. The most common is queuing, waiting in line. The tickets would
go on sale at a particular time, and people would show up and wait. Now ticket sellers have
virtual waiting rooms online. Tickets for the World Series go on sale at a particular time in
September, and the people who log on to team Web sites at the right moment get into an
electronic queue and can buy tickets. Often tickets are sold out in a matter of minutes.
There are also, of course, favored customers. Those who get tickets without queuing are local
politicians, sponsors, and friends of the artist or friends of the players.
But “once the dust settles,” the power of technology and the concept of opportunity cost
take over. Even if you get the ticket for the (relatively) low price of $50, that is not the true cost.
The true cost is what you give up to sit in the seat. If people on eBay, StubHub, or Ticketmaster
are willing to pay $300 for your ticket, that’s what you must pay, or sacrifice, to go to the con-
cert. Many people—even strong fans—will choose to sell that ticket. Once again, it is difficult
to stop the market from rationing the tickets to those people who are willing and able to pay
the most.

PART I
Introduction to Economics
Prices and the Allocation of Resources
Thinking of the market system as a mechanism for allocating scarce goods and services among
competing demanders is very revealing, but the market determines more than just the distribu-
tion of final outputs. It also determines what gets produced and how resources are allocated
among competing uses.
Consider a change in consumer preferences that leads to an increase in demand for a specific
good or service. During the 1980s, for example, people began going to restaurants more fre-
quently than before. Researchers think that this trend, which continues today, is partially the
result of social changes (such as a dramatic rise in the number of two-earner families) and par-
tially the result of rising incomes. The market responded to this change in demand by shifting
resources, both capital and labor, into more and better restaurants.
With the increase in demand for restaurant meals, the price of eating out rose and the restau-
rant business became more profitable. The higher profits attracted new businesses and provided
old restaurants with an incentive to expand. As new capital, seeking profits, flowed into the
restaurant business, so did labor. New restaurants need chefs. Chefs need training, and the higher
wages that came with increased demand provided an incentive for them to get it. In response to
the increase in demand for training, new cooking schools opened and existing schools began to
offer courses in the culinary arts. This story could go on and on, but the point is clear:
Price Floor
As we have seen, price ceilings, often imposed because price rationing is viewed as 
unfair, result in alternative rationing mechanisms that are inefficient and may be equally unfair.
Some of the same arguments can be made for price floors. A price floor is a minimum price
below which exchange is not permitted. If a price floor is set above the equilibrium price, the
result will be excess supply; quantity supplied will be greater than quantity demanded.
The most common example of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is a floor 
set for the price of labor. Employers (who demand labor) are not permitted under federal law to
pay a wage less than $7.25 per hour (in 2010) to workers (who supply labor). Critics argue that
since the minimum wage is above equilibrium, the result will be wasteful unemployment. At the
wage of $7.25, the quantity of labor demanded is less than the quantity of labor supplied.
Whenever a price floor is set above equilibrium, there will be an excess supply.
Supply and Demand Analysis: 
An Oil Import Fee
The basic logic of supply and demand is a powerful tool of analysis. As an extended example of
the power of this logic, we will consider a proposal to impose a tax on imported oil. The idea of
taxing imported oil is hotly debated, and the tools we have learned thus far will show us the
effects of such a tax.
Price changes resulting from shifts of demand in output markets cause profits to rise or
fall. Profits attract capital; losses lead to disinvestment. Higher wages attract labor and
encourage workers to acquire skills. At the core of the system, supply, demand, and
prices in input and output markets determine the allocation of resources and the ulti-
mate combinations of goods and services produced.
No matter how good the intentions of private organizations and governments, it is very
difficult to prevent the price system from operating and to stop people’s willingness to pay
from asserting itself. Every time an alternative is tried, the price system seems to sneak in
the back door. With favored customers and black markets, the final distribution may be
even more unfair than what would result from simple price rationing.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
The Price Mechanism at Work for Shakespeare
Every summer, New York City puts on free performances of
Shakespeare in the Park. Tickets are distributed on a first-come-
first-serve basis at the Delacorte Theatre in the park beginning at
1 P.M. on the day of the show. People usually begin lining up at
6 A.M. when the park opens; by 10 A.M. the line has typically reached
a length sufficient to give away all available tickets.
When you examine the people standing in line for these tickets,
most of them seem to be fairly young. Many carry book bags identi-
fying them as students in one of New York’s many colleges. Of
course, all college students may be fervent Shakespeare fans, but can
you think of another reason for the composition of the line? Further,
when you attend one of the plays and look around, the audience
appears much older and much sleeker than the people who were
standing in line. What is going on?
While the tickets are “free” in terms of financial costs, their true
price includes the value of the time spent standing in line. Thus, the
tickets are cheaper for people (for example, students) whose time
value is lower than they are for high-wage earners, like an invest-
ment banker from Goldman Sachs. The true cost of a ticket is $0
plus the opportunity cost of the time spent in line. If the average
person spends 4 hours in line, as is done in the Central Park case, for
someone with a high wage, the true cost of the ticket might be very
high. For example, a lawyer who earns $300 an hour would be giving
up $1,200 to wait in line. It should not surprise you to see more peo-
ple waiting in line for whom the tickets are inexpensive.
What about the people who are at the performance? Think about
our discussion of the power of entrepreneurs. In this case, the stu-
dents who stand in line as consumers of the tickets also can play a
role as producers. In fact, the students can produce tickets relatively
cheaply by waiting in line. They can then turn around and sell those
tickets to the high-wage Shakespeare lovers. These days eBay is a
great source of tickets to free events, sold by individuals with low
opportunity costs of their time who queued up. Craigslist even pro-
vides listings for people who are willing to wait in line for you.
Of course, now and again we do encounter a busy business-
person in one of the Central Park lines. Recently, one of the authors
encountered one and asked him why he was waiting in line rather
than using eBay, and he replied that it reminded him of when he was
young, waiting in line for rock concerts.
Consider the facts. Between 1985 and 1989, the United States increased its dependence on
oil imports dramatically. In 1989, total U.S. demand for crude oil was 13.6 million barrels per
day. Of that amount, only 7.7 million barrels per day (57 percent) were supplied by U.S. pro-
ducers, with the remaining 5.9 million barrels per day (43 percent) imported. The price of oil
on world markets that year averaged about $18. This heavy dependence on foreign oil left the
United States vulnerable to the price shock that followed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August
1990. In the months following the invasion, the price of crude oil on world markets shot up to
$40 per barrel.
Even before the invasion, many economists and some politicians had recommended a stiff
oil import fee (or tax) that would, it was argued, reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil by
(1) reducing overall consumption and (2) providing an incentive for increased domestic produc-
tion. An added bonus would be improved air quality from the reduction in driving.
Supply and demand analysis makes the arguments of the import fee proponents easier to
understand. Figure 4.5(a) shows the U.S. market for oil. The world price of oil is assumed to be
$18, and the United States is assumed to be able to buy all the oil that it wants at this price. This
means that domestic producers cannot charge any more than $18 per barrel. The curve labeled
SupplyUS shows the amount that domestic suppliers will produce at each price level. At a price
of $18, domestic production is 7.7 million barrels. U.S. producers will produce at point A on
the supply curve. The total quantity of oil demanded in the United States in 1989 was 13.6 mil-
lion barrels per day. At a price of $18, the quantity demanded in the United States is point B on
the demand curve.

88
PART I
Introduction to Economics
The difference between the total quantity demanded (13.6 million barrels per day) and
domestic production (7.7 million barrels per day) is total imports (5.9 million barrels 
per day).
Now suppose that the government levies a tax of 33 1/3 percent on imported oil.
Because the import price is $18, a tax of $6 (or .3333  $18) per barrel means that
importers of oil in the United States will pay a total of $24 per barrel ($18 + $6). This new,
higher price means that U.S. producers can also charge up to $24 for a barrel of crude. Note,
however, that the tax is paid only on imported oil. Thus, the entire $24 paid for domestic
crude goes to domestic producers.
Figure 4.5(b) shows the result of the tax. First, because of a higher price, the quantity
demanded drops to 12.2 million barrels per day. This is a movement along the demand curve
from point B to point D.At the same time, the quantity supplied by domestic producers increased
to 9.0 million barrels per day. This is a movement along the supply curve from point A to point C.

At a world price of $18, domes-
tic production is 7.7 million bar-
rels per day and the total
quantity of oil demanded in the
United States is 13.6 million bar-
rels per day. The difference is
total imports (5.9 million barrels
per day).
If the government levies a 
33 1/3 percent tax on imports,
the price of a barrel of oil rises
to $24. The quantity demanded
falls to 12.2 million barrels per
day. At the same time, the
quantity supplied by domestic
producers increases to 9.0 mil-
lion barrels per day and the
quantity imported falls to 
3.2 million barrels per day.

With an increase in domestic quantity supplied and a decrease in domestic quantity demanded,
imports decrease to 3.2 million barrels per day (12.2 – 9.0).3
The tax also generates revenues for the federal government. The total tax revenue collected is
equal to the tax per barrel ($6) times the number of imported barrels. When the quantity
imported is 3.2 million barrels per day, total revenue is $6  3.2 million, or $19.2 million per day
(about $7 billion per year).
What does all of this mean? In the final analysis, an oil import fee would (1) increase domes-
tic production and (2) reduce overall consumption. To the extent that one believes that
Americans are consuming too much oil, the reduced consumption may be a good thing.
Supply and Demand and Market Efficiency
Clearly, supply and demand curves help explain the way that markets and market prices work to
allocate scarce resources. Recall that when we try to understand “how the system works,” we are
doing “positive economics.”
Supply and demand curves can also be used to illustrate the idea of market efficiency, an
important aspect of “normative economics.” To understand the ideas, you first must understand
the concepts of consumer and producer surplus.
Consumer Surplus
The argument, made several times already, that the market forces us to reveal a great deal about
our personal preferences is an extremely important one, and it bears repeating at least once more
here. If you are free to choose within the constraints imposed by prices and your income and you
decide to buy, for example, a hamburger for $2.50, you have “revealed” that a hamburger is worth
at least $2.50 to you.
A simple market demand curve such as the one in Figure 4.6(a) illustrates this point quite
clearly. At the current market price of $2.50, consumers will purchase 7 million hamburgers per
month. There is only one price in the market, and the demand curve tells us how many hamburg-
ers households would buy if they could purchase all they wanted at the posted price of $2.50.
Anyone who values a hamburger at $2.50 or more will buy it. Anyone who does not value a ham-
burger that highly will not buy it.
Some people, however, value hamburgers at more than $2.50. As Figure 4.6(a) shows, even if
the price were $5.00, consumers would still buy 1 million hamburgers. If these people were able
to buy the good at a price of $2.50, they would earn a consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is
the difference between the maximum amount a person is willing to pay for a good and its current
market price. The consumer surplus earned by the people willing to pay $5.00 for a hamburger is
approximately equal to the shaded area between point A and the price, $2.50.
The second million hamburgers in Figure 4.6(a) are valued at more than the market price as
well, although the consumer surplus gained is slightly less. Point B on the market demand curve
shows the maximum amount that consumers would be willing to pay for the second million ham-
burgers. The consumer surplus earned by these people is equal to the shaded area between B and
the price, $2.50. Similarly, for the third million hamburgers, maximum willingness to pay is given
by point C; consumer surplus is a bit lower than it is at points A and B, but it is still significant.
The total value of the consumer surplus suggested by the data in Figure 4.6(a) is roughly
equal to the area of the shaded triangle in Figure 4.6(b). To understand why this is so, think about
offering hamburgers to consumers at successively lower prices. If the good were actually sold for
$2.50, those near point A on the demand curve would get a large surplus; those at point B would
get a smaller surplus. Those at point E would get no surplus.

3 These figures were not chosen randomly. It is interesting to note that in 1985, the world price of crude oil averaged about $24 a bar-
rel. Domestic production was 9.0 million barrels per day and domestic consumption was 12.2 million barrels per day, with imports of
only 3.2 million. The drop in the world price between 1985 and 1989 increased imports to 5.9 million, an 84 percent increase.

Introduction to Economics
Producer Surplus
Similarly, the supply curve in a market shows the amount that firms willingly produce and supply
to the market at various prices. Presumably it is because the price is sufficient to cover the costs or
the opportunity costs of production and give producers enough profit to keep them in business.
When speaking of cost of production, we include everything that a producer must give up in
order to produce a good.
A simple market supply curve like the one in Figure 4.7(a) illustrates this point quite
clearly. At the current market price of $2.50, producers will produce and sell 7 million ham-
burgers. There is only one price in the market, and the supply curve tells us the quantity sup-
plied at each price.
Notice, however, that if the price were just $0.75 (75 cents), although production would be
much lower—most producers would be out of business at that price—a few producers would
actually be supplying burgers. In fact, producers would supply about 1 million burgers to the
market. These firms must have lower costs: They are more efficient or they have access to raw beef
at a lower price or perhaps they can hire low-wage labor.
If these efficient, low-cost producers are able to charge $2.50 for each hamburger, they are
earning what is called a producer surplus. Producer surplus is the difference between the current
market price and the full cost of production for the firm. The first million hamburgers would
generate a producer surplus of $2.50 minus $0.75, or $1.75 per hamburger: a total of $1.75 mil-
lion. The second million hamburgers would also generate a producer surplus because the price of
$2.50 exceeds the producers’ total cost of producing these hamburgers, which is above $0.75 but
much less than $2.50.
The total value of the producer surplus received by producers of hamburgers at a price of
$2.50 per burger is roughly equal to the shaded triangle in Figure 4.7(b). Those producers just
able to make a profit producing burgers will be near point E on the supply curve and will earn
very little in the way of surplus.

As illustrated in Figure 4.6(a), some consumers (see point A) are willing to pay as much as $5.00 each for
hamburgers. Since the market price is just $2.50, they receive a consumer surplus of $2.50 for each ham-
burger that they consume. Others (see point B) are willing to pay something less than $5.00 and receive a
slightly smaller surplus. Since the market price of hamburgers is just $2.50, the area of the shaded triangle in
Figure 4.6(b) is equal to total consumer surplus.

Demand and Supply Applications 91
Competitive Markets Maximize the Sum of Producer and
Consumer Surplus
In the preceding example, the quantity of hamburgers supplied and the quantity of hamburgers
demanded are equal at $2.50. Figure 4.8 shows the total net benefits to consumers and produc-
ers resulting from the production of 7 million hamburgers. Consumers receive benefits in excess
of the price they pay and equal to the blue shaded area between the demand curve and
the price line at $2.50; the area is equal to the amount of consumer surplus being earned.
Producers receive compensation in excess of costs and equal to the red shaded area between the

supply curve and the price line at $2.50; the area is equal to the amount of producer surplus
being earned.
Now consider the result to consumers and producers if production were to be reduced
to 4 million burgers. Look carefully at Figure 4.9(a). At 4 million burgers, consumers are
willing to pay $3.75 for hamburgers and there are firms whose costs make it worthwhile to
supply at a price as low as $1.50, yet something is stopping production at 4 million. The
result is a loss of both consumer and producer surplus. You can see in Figure 4.9(a) that if
production were expanded from 4 million to 7 million, the market would yield more con-
sumer surplus and more producer surplus. The total loss of producer and consumer surplus
from underproduction and, as we will see shortly, from overproduction is referred to as a
deadweight loss. In Figure 4.9(a) the deadweight loss is equal to the area of triangle ABC
shaded in yellow.
Figure 4.9(b) illustrates how a deadweight loss of both producer and consumer surplus can
result from overproduction as well. For every hamburger produced above 7 million, consumers
are willing to pay less than the cost of production. The cost of the resources needed to produce
hamburgers above 7 million exceeds the benefits to consumers, resulting in a net loss of producer
and consumer surplus equal to the yellow shaded area ABC.
Potential Causes of Deadweight Loss From Under- and
Overproduction
Most of the next few chapters will discuss perfectly competitive markets in which prices are
determined by the free interaction of supply and demand. As you will see, when supply and
demand interact freely, competitive markets produce what people want at the least cost, that

triangle ABC shaded in yellow. This is called the deadweight loss from underproduction. Figure 4.9(b)
shows the consequences of producing 10 million hamburgers per month instead of 7 million
hamburgers per month. As production increases from 7 million to 10 million hamburgers, the full 
cost of production rises above consumers’ willingness to pay, resulting in a deadweight loss equal to 
the area of triangle ABC.

is, they are efficient. Beginning in Chapter 13, however, we will begin to relax assumptions
and will discover a number of naturally occurring sources of market failure. Monopoly
power gives firms the incentive to underproduce and overprice, taxes and subsidies may dis-
tort consumer choices, external costs such as pollution and congestion may lead to over- or
underproduction of some goods, and artificial price floors and price ceilings may have the
same effects.
Looking Ahead
We have now examined the basic forces of supply and demand and discussed the
market/price system. These fundamental concepts will serve as building blocks for what
comes next. Whether you are studying microeconomics or macroeconomics, you will be
studying the functions of markets and the behavior of market participants in more detail in
the following chapters.
Because the concepts presented in the first four chapters are so important to your under-
standing of what is to come, this might be a good time for you to review this material.
THE PRICE SYSTEM: RATIONING AND ALLOCATING
RESOURCES p. 79 
1. In a market economy, the market system (or price system)
serves two functions. It determines the allocation of
resources among producers and the final mix of outputs.
It also distributes goods and services on the basis of will-
ingness and ability to pay. In this sense, it serves as a price
rationing device.
2. Governments as well as private firms sometimes decide
not to use the market system to ration an item for which
there is excess demand. Examples of nonprice rationing
systems include queuing, favored customers, and ration
coupons. The most common rationale for such policies 
is “fairness.”
3. Attempts to bypass the market and use alternative
nonprice rationing devices are more difficult and costly
than it would seem at first glance. Schemes that open 
up opportunities for favored customers, black markets,
and side payments often end up less “fair” than the 
free market.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND ANALYSIS: AN OIL 
IMPORT FEE p. 86
4. The basic logic of supply and demand is a powerful 
tool for analysis. For example, supply and demand
analysis shows that an oil import tax will reduce quantity
of oil demanded, increase domestic production, and
generate revenues for the government.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND MARKET 
EFFICIENCY p. 89
5. Supply and demand curves can also be used to illustrate
the idea of market efficiency, an important aspect of nor-
mative economics.
6. Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum
amount a person is willing to pay for a good and the current
market price.
7. Producer surplus is the difference between the current market
price and the full cost of production for the firm.
8. At free market equilibrium with competitive markets,
the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus
is maximized.
9. The total loss of producer and consumer surplus from
underproduction or overproduction is referred to as a
deadweight loss.

b. An increase in the price of chicken has an impact on the

c. Incomes rise, shifting the demand for gasoline. Crude oil
prices rise, shifting the supply of gasoline. At the new equi-

a. In the summer of 2010, Spanish artist Pablo Picasso’s
Portrait d’Angel Fernández de Soto was sold in London for
$51.6 million.
b. In 2010, hogs in the United States were selling for 81 cents
per pound, up from 58 cents per pound a year before. This
was due primarily to the fact that supply had decreased dur-
ing the period.
c. Early in 2009, a survey of greenhouses indicated that the
demand for houseplants was rising sharply. At the same
time, large numbers of low-cost producers started grow-
ing plants for sale. The overall result was a drop in the
average price of houseplants and an increase in the num-
ber of plants sold.
2. Every demand curve must eventually hit the quantity axis
because with limited incomes, there is always a price so high
that there is no demand for the good. Do you agree or dis-
agree? Why?
3. When excess demand exists for tickets to a major sporting event
or a concert, profit opportunities exist for scalpers. Explain
briefly using supply and demand curves to illustrate. Some
argue that scalpers work to the advantage of everyone and are
“efficient.” Do you agree or disagree? Explain briefly.
4. In an effort to “support” the price of some agricultural goods,
the Department of Agriculture pays farmers a subsidy in cash
for every acre that they leave unplanted. The Agriculture
Department argues that the subsidy increases the “cost” of
planting and that it will reduce supply and increase the price
of competitively produced agricultural goods. Critics argue
that because the subsidy is a payment to farmers, it will
reduce costs and lead to lower prices. Which argument is cor-
rect? Explain.
5. The rent for apartments in New York City has been rising
sharply. Demand for apartments in New York City has 
been rising sharply as well. This is hard to explain because 
the law of demand says that higher prices should lead to 
lower demand. Do you agree or disagree? Explain 
your answer.

c. Under the price ceiling, quantity supplied and quantity

In economics, simple logic often tells
us how a change in one variable, such
as the price of a good or an interest
rate, is likely to affect behavior. It is a
safe bet, for example, that when Barnes
& Noble and Amazon.com both low-
ered the price of their e-Readers in the
summer of 2010, sales increased. When
many universities lowered the price of
football tickets to students (many to a
price of zero), the schools did so in an
attempt to increase the number of stu-
dent fans in their stadiums. If the gov-
ernment helps to raise the price of
cigarettes by increasing cigarette taxes, it is likely that tobacco sales will suffer.
The work we did in earlier chapters tells us the direction of the changes we would expect
to see from price changes in markets. But in each of the preceding examples and in most other
situations, knowing the direction of a change is not enough. What we really need to know to
help us make the right decisions is how big the reactions are. How many more fans would
come to a football game if the price were lowered? Is the added team spirit worth the lost
ticket revenue? Would the university get more fans by charging students but giving them free
hot dogs at the game? For profit-making firms, knowing the quantity that would be sold at a
lowered price is key. If sales increases following a price cut are large enough, revenues may
rise. To answer these questions, we must know more than just direction; we must know some-
thing about market responsiveness.
Understanding the responsiveness of consumers and producers in markets to price
changes is key to answering a wide range of economic problems. Should McDonald’s lower
the price of its Big Mac? For McDonald’s, the answer depends on whether that price cut
increases or decreases its profits. The answer to that, in turn, depends on how its customers
are likely to respond to the price cut. How many more Big Macs will be sold, and will the new
sales come at the expense of the sandwiches sold at Subway or be a substitution of
McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets for Big Macs? How many potential new smokers will be
deterred from smoking by higher cigarette prices the government has induced? Questions
such as these lie at the core of economics. To answer these questions, we need to measure the
magnitude of market responses.
The importance of actual measurement cannot be overstated. Much of the research being
done in economics today involves the collection and analysis of quantitative data that measure
behavior. The ability to analyze large amounts of data increased enormously with the advent of
modern computers.
Economists commonly measure responsiveness using the concept of elasticity. Elasticity is a
general concept that can be used to quantify the response in one variable when another variable

A with respect to B is equal to the percentage change in A divided by the percentage change in B:
elasticity of A with respect to B = %¢A
%¢B
In the examples discussed previously, we often consider responsiveness or elasticity by look-
ing at prices: How does demand for a product respond when its price changes? This is known as
the price elasticity of demand. How does supply respond when prices change? This is the price
elasticity of supply. As in the McDonald’s example, sometimes it is important to know how the
price of one good—for example, the Big Mac—affects the demand for another good—Chicken
McNuggets. This is called the cross-price elasticity of demand.
But the concept of elasticity goes well beyond responsiveness to price changes. As we will see,
we can look at elasticities as a way to understand responses to changes in income and almost any
other major determinant of supply and demand in a market. We begin with a discussion of price
elasticity of demand.
Price Elasticity of Demand
You have already seen the law of demand at work. Recall that ceteris paribus, when prices rise,
quantity demanded can be expected to decline. When prices fall, quantity demanded can be
expected to rise. The normal negative relationship between price and quantity demanded is
reflected in the downward slope of demand curves.
Slope and Elasticity
The slope of a demand curve may in a rough way reveal the responsiveness of the quantity
demanded to price changes, but slope can be quite misleading. In fact, it is not a good formal
measure of responsiveness.
Consider the two identical demand curves in Figure 5.1. The only difference between the two is
that quantity demanded is measured in pounds in the graph on the left and in ounces in the graph
on the right. When we calculate the numerical value of each slope, however, we get very different

charge a higher price.

yet the two curves represent the exact same behavior. If we had changed dollars to cents on the

you do not understand how these numbers are calculated.)
The problem is that the numerical value of slope depends on the units used to measure the
variables on the axes. To correct this problem, we must convert the changes in price and quantity
to percentages. By looking at by how much the percent quantity demanded changes for a given
percent price change, we have a measure of responsiveness that does not change with the unit of
measurement. The price increase in Figure 5.1 leads to a decline of 5 pounds, or 80 ounces, in the
quantity of steak demanded—a decline of 50 percent from the initial 10 pounds, or 160 ounces,
whether we measure the steak in pounds or ounces.
We define price elasticity of demand simply as the ratio of the percentage of change in
quantity demanded to the percentage change in price.
Percentage changes should always carry the sign (plus or minus) of the change. Positive
changes, or increases, take a (+). Negative changes, or decreases, take a (-). The law of demand
implies that price elasticity of demand is nearly always a negative number: Price increases (+) will
lead to decreases in quantity demanded (-), and vice versa. Thus, the numerator and denomina-
tor should have opposite signs, resulting in a negative ratio.
Types of Elasticity
The elasticity of demand can vary between 0 and minus infinity. An elasticity of 0 indicates that
the quantity demanded does not respond at all to a price change. A demand curve with an elastic-
ity of 0 is called perfectly inelastic and is illustrated in Figure 5.2(a). A demand curve in which
even the smallest price increase reduces quantity demanded to zero is known as a perfectly elastic
demand curve and is illustrated in Figure 5.2(b). A good way to remember the difference between
the two perfect elasticities is

PART I
Introduction to Economics
What type of good might have a perfectly elastic demand curve? Suppose there are two iden-
tical vendors selling Good Humor bars on a beach. If one vendor increased his price, all the buy-
ers would flock to the second vendor. In this case, a small price increase costs the first vendor all
his business; the demand he faces is perfectly elastic. Products with perfectly inelastic demand are
harder to find, but some life-saving medical products like insulin may be close, in that very high
price increases may elicit no response in terms of quantity demanded.
Of course, a lot of products have elasticities between the two extremes. When an elasticity is
over –1.0 in absolute value,1 we refer to the demand as elastic. In this case, the percentage change
in quantity is larger in absolute value than the percentage change in price. Here consumers are
responding a lot to a price change. When an elasticity is less than 1 in absolute value, it is referred
to as inelastic. In these markets, consumers respond much less to price changes. The demand for
oil is inelastic, for example, because even with a price increase, it is hard to substitute oil for other
products. The demand for a Nestlé Crunch bar is much more elastic, in part because there are so
many more substitutes.
A special case is one in which the elasticity of demand is minus one. Here, we say demand has
unitary elasticity. In this case, the percentage change in price is exactly equal to the percentage
change in quantity demanded, in absolute value terms. As you will see when we look at the rela-
tionship between revenue and elasticities later in this chapter, unitary elastic demand curves have
some very interesting properties.
A warning: You must be very careful about signs. Because it is generally understood that
demand elasticities are negative (demand curves have a negative slope), they are often reported and
discussed without the negative sign. For example, a technical paper might report that the demand
for housing “appears to be inelastic with respect to price, or less than 1 (.6).”What the writer means
is that the estimated elasticity is –.6, which is between zero and –1. Its absolute value is less than 1.
Calculating Elasticities
Elasticities must be calculated cautiously.Return for a moment to the demand curves in Figure 5.1 on
p. 98. The fact that these two identical demand curves have dramatically different slopes should be
enough to convince you that slope is a poor measure of responsiveness.As we will see shortly, a given
straight line, which has the same slope all along it, will show different elasticities at various points.
The concept of elasticity circumvents the measurement problem posed by the graphs in
Figure 5.1 by converting the changes in price and quantity to percentage changes. Recall that elas-
ticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change
in price.
Calculating Percentage Changes
Because we need to know percentage changes to calculate elasticity, let us begin our example by
calculating the percentage change in quantity demanded. Figure 5.1(a) shows that the quantity of
steak demanded increases from 5 pounds (Q1) to 10 pounds (Q2) when price drops from $3 to
$2 per pound. Thus, the change in quantity demanded is equal to Q2 - Q1, or 5 pounds.
To convert this change into a percentage change,we must decide on a base against which to calcu-
late the percentage.It is often convenient to use the initial value of quantity demanded (Q1) as the base.
To calculate percentage change in quantity demanded using the initial value as the base, the
following formula is used:
1 Absolute value or absolute size means ignoring the sign. The absolute value of -4 is 4.
= Q2 - Q1

CHAPTER 5
Elasticity 101
In Figure 5.1, Q2 = 10 and Q1 = 5. Thus,
Expressing this equation verbally, we can say that an increase in quantity demanded from 
5 pounds to 10 pounds is a 100 percent increase from 5 pounds. Note that you arrive at exactly
the same result if you use the diagram in Figure 5.1(b), in which quantity demanded is measured
in ounces. An increase from Q1 (80 ounces) to Q2 (160 ounces) is a 100 percent increase.
We can calculate the percentage change in price in a similar way. Once again, let us use the
initial value of P—that is, P1—as the base for calculating the percentage. By using P1 as the base,
the formula for calculating the percentage of change in P is
% change in quantity demanded = 10 - 5
5
* 100% = 5
5 * 100% = 100%
= P2 - P1
P1
* 100%
 % change in price = change in price
P1
* 100%
In Figure 5.1(a), P2 equals 2 and P1 equals 3. Thus, the change in P, or 
P, is a negative
number: P2 - P1 = 2 - 3 = -1. This is true because the change is a decrease in price. Plugging the
values of P1 and P2 into the preceding equation, we get
In other words, decreasing the price from $3 to $2 is a 33.3 percent decline.
Elasticity Is a Ratio of Percentages
Once the changes in quantity demanded and price have been converted to percentages, calculat-
ing elasticity is a matter of simple division. Recall the formal definition of elasticity:
% change in price = 2 - 3
3
* 100% =
- 1
3
* 100% =
- 33.3%
¢
price elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded
% change in price
If demand is elastic, the ratio of percentage change in quantity demanded to percentage
change in price will have an absolute value greater than 1. If demand is inelastic, the ratio will
have an absolute value between 0 and 1. If the two percentages are equal, so that a given percent-
age change in price causes an equal percentage change in quantity demanded, elasticity is equal to
-1; this is unitary elasticity.
Substituting the preceding percentages, we see that a 33.3 percent decrease in price leads to a
100 percent increase in quantity demanded; thus,
According to these calculations, the demand for steak is elastic when we look at the range
between $2 and $3.
The Midpoint Formula
Although simple, the use of the initial values of P and Q as the bases for calculating percentage
changes can be misleading. Let us return to the example of demand for steak in Figure 5.1(a),
where we have a change in quantity demanded of 5 pounds. Using the initial value Q1 as the base,
we calculated that this change represents a 100 percent increase over the base. Now suppose that
the price of steak rises to $3 again, causing the quantity demanded to drop back to 5 pounds. How
price elasticity of demand = +100%
-33.3% = -3.0

102
PART I
Introduction to Economics
much of a percentage decrease in quantity demanded is this? We now have Q1 = 10 and Q2 = 5.
With the same formula we used earlier, we get
Thus, an increase from 5 pounds to 10 pounds is a 100 percent increase (because the initial value
used for the base is 5), but a decrease from 10 pounds to 5 pounds is only a 50 percent decrease
(because the initial value used for the base is 10). This does not make much sense because in both
cases, we are calculating elasticity on the same interval on the demand curve. Changing the
“direction” of the calculation should not change the elasticity.
To describe percentage changes more accurately, a simple convention has been adopted.
Instead of using the initial values of Q and P as the bases for calculating percentages, we use the
midpoints of these variables as the bases. That is, we use the value halfway between P1 and P2 for
the base in calculating the percentage change in price and the value halfway between Q1 and Q2 as
the base for calculating percentage change in quantity demanded.
Thus, the midpoint formula for calculating the percentage change in quantity demanded
becomes
= 5 - 10
10
* 100% = -50%
= Q2 - Q1
Q1
* 100%
 % change in quantity demanded = change in quantity demanded

* 100%
=
Q2 - Q1
(Q1 + Q2)>2 * 100%
 % change in quantity demanded = change in quantity demanded
(Q1 + Q2)>2
* 100%
Substituting the numbers from the original Figure 5.1(a), we get
Using the point halfway between P1 and P2 as the base for calculating the percentage change
in price, we get
% change in quantity demanded =
10 - 5
(5 + 10)>2 * 100% =
5
7.5 * 100% = 66.7%
=
P2 - P1
(P1 + P2)>2 * 100%
 % change in price = change in price
(P1 + P2)>2
* 100%
Substituting the numbers from the original Figure 5.1(a) yields
We can thus say that a change from a quantity of 5 to a quantity of 10 is a +66.7 percent
change using the midpoint formula and that a change in price from $3 to $2 is a -40 percent
change using the midpoint formula.
Using these percentages to calculate elasticity yields
price elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded
% change in price
=
66.7%
-40.0% = -1.67
% change in price =
2 - 3
(3 + 2)>2 * 100% = -1
2.5 * 100% = -40.0%
midpoint formula
A more
precise way of calculating
percentages using the value
halfway between P1 and P2 for
the base in calculating the
percentage change in price and
the value halfway between Q1
and Q2 as the base for
calculating the percentage
change in quantity demanded.

Using the midpoint formula in this case gives a lower demand elasticity, but the demand remains
elastic because the percentage change in quantity demanded is still greater than the percentage
change in price in absolute size.
The calculations based on the midpoint approach are summarized in Table 5.1.
CHAPTER 5
Elasticity 103
Elasticity Changes Along a Straight-Line Demand Curve
An interesting and important point is that elasticity changes from point to point along a demand
curve even when the slope of that demand curve does not change—that is, even along a straight-
line demand curve. Indeed, the differences in elasticity along a demand curve can be quite large.
Before we go through the calculations to show how elasticity changes along a demand curve,
it is useful to think why elasticity might change as we vary price. Consider again McDonald’s deci-
sion to reduce the price of a Big Mac. Suppose McDonald’s found that at the current price of $3,
a small price cut would generate a large number of new customers who wanted burgers. Demand,
in short, was relatively elastic. What happens as McDonald’s continues to cut its price? As the
price moves from $2.50 to $2.00, for example, new customers lured in by the price cuts are likely
to decrease; in some sense, McDonald’s will be running out of customers who are interested in its
burgers at any price. It should come as no surprise that as we move down a typical straight-line
demand curve, price elasticity falls. Demand becomes less elastic as price is reduced. This lesson
has important implications for price-setting strategies of firms.
Consider the demand schedule shown in Table 5.2 and the demand curve in Figure 5.3.
Herb works about 22 days per month in a downtown San Francisco office tower. On the top floor

of the building is a nice dining room. If lunch in the dining room were $10, Herb would eat there
only twice a month. If the price of lunch fell to $9, he would eat there 4 times a month. (Herb
would bring his lunch to work on other days.) If lunch were only a dollar, he would eat there
20 times a month.
Let us calculate price elasticity of demand between points A and B on the demand curve in
Figure 5.3. Moving from A to B, the price of a lunch drops from $10 to $9 (a decrease of $1) and
the number of dining room lunches that Herb eats per month increases from two to four (an
increase of two). We will use the midpoint approach.
First, we calculate the percentage change in quantity demanded:
Substituting the numbers from Figure 5.3, we get
Next, we calculate the percentage change in price:
Substituting the numbers from Figure 5.3, we get
Finally, we calculate elasticity by dividing
The percentage change in quantity demanded is 6.4 times larger than the percentage change in
price. In other words, Herb’s demand between points A and B is quite responsive; his demand
between points A and B is elastic.

CHAPTER 5
Elasticity 105
Now consider a different movement along the same demand curve in Figure 5.3. Moving
from point C to point D, the graph indicates that at a price of $3, Herb eats in the office dining
room 16 times per month. If the price drops to $2, he will eat there 18 times per month. These
changes expressed in numerical terms are exactly the same as the price and quantity changes
between points A and B in the figure—price falls $1, and quantity demanded increases by two
meals. Expressed in percentage terms, however, these changes are very different.
By using the midpoints as the base, the $1 price decline is only a 10.5 percent reduction when
price is around $9.50, between points A and B. The same $1 price decline is a 40 percent reduc-
tion when price is around $2.50, between points C and D. The two-meal increase in quantity
demanded is a 66.7 percent increase when Herb averages only 3 meals per month, but it is only an
11.76 percent increase when he averages 17 meals per month. The elasticity of demand between
points C and D is thus 11.76 percent divided by -40 percent, or -0.294. (Work these numbers out
for yourself by using the midpoint formula.)
The percentage changes between A and B are very different from those between C and D, and
so are the elasticities. Herb’s demand is quite elastic (-6.4) between points A and B; a 10.5 percent
reduction in price caused a 66.7 percent increase in quantity demanded. However, his demand is
inelastic (-0.294) between points C and D; a 40 percent decrease in price caused only an 11.76 per-
cent increase in quantity demanded.
Again, it is useful to keep in mind the underlying economics as well as the mathematics. At
high prices, there is a great deal of potential demand for the dining room to capture. Hence,
quantity is likely to respond well to price cuts. At low prices, everyone who is likely to come to the
dining room already has.
Elasticity and Total Revenue
As we saw in Chapter 4, the oil-producing countries have had some success keeping oil prices
high by controlling supply. To some extent, reducing supply and driving up prices has increased
the total oil revenues to the producing countries. We would not, however, expect this strategy to
work for everyone. If the organization of banana-exporting countries (OBEC) had done the same
thing, the strategy would not have worked.
Why? Suppose OBEC decides to cut production by 30 percent to drive up the world price of
bananas. At first, when the quantity of bananas supplied declines, the quantity demanded is
greater than the quantity supplied and the world price rises. The issue for OBEC, however, is how
much the world price will rise. That is, how much will people be willing to pay to continue con-
suming bananas? Unless the percentage increase in price is greater than the percentage decrease in
output, the OBEC countries will lose revenues.
A little research shows us that the prospects are not good for OBEC. There are many reason-
able substitutes for bananas. As the price of bananas rises, people simply eat fewer bananas as
they switch to eating more pineapples or oranges. Many people are simply not willing to pay a
higher price for bananas. The quantity of bananas demanded declines 30 percent—to the new
quantity supplied—after only a modest price rise, and OBEC fails in its mission; its revenues
decrease instead of increase.
We have seen that oil-producing countries often can increase their revenues by restricting
supply and pushing up the market price of crude oil. We also argued that a similar strategy by
banana-producing countries would probably fail. Why? The quantity of oil demanded is not as
responsive to a change in price as is the quantity of bananas demanded. In other words, the
demand for oil is more inelastic than is the demand for bananas. One of the very useful features
of elasticity is that knowing the value of price elasticity allows us to quickly see what happens to
a firm’s revenue as it raises and cuts its prices. When demand is inelastic, raising prices will raise
revenues; when (as in the banana case) demand is elastic, price increases reduce revenues.
We can now use the more formal definition of elasticity to make more precise our argument
of why oil producers would succeed and banana producers would fail as they raise prices. In any
market, P  Q is total revenue (TR) received by producers:
 total revenue = price * quantity
TR = P * Q

106
PART I
Introduction to Economics
The oil producers’ total revenue is the price per barrel of oil (P) times the number of barrels its
participant countries sell (Q). To banana producers, total revenue is the price per bunch times the
number of bunches sold.
When price increases in a market, quantity demanded declines. As we have seen, when price
(P) declines, quantity demanded (QD) increases. This is true in all markets. The two factors, P and
QD, move in opposite directions:
P p : QD q
on quantity demanded:                 and
effects of price changes
P q : QD p
Because total revenue is the product of P and Q, whether TR rises or falls in response to a
price increase depends on which is bigger: the percentage increase in price or the percentage
decrease in quantity demanded. If the percentage decrease in quantity demanded is smaller
than the percentage increase in price, total revenue will rise. This occurs when demand is
inelastic. In this case, the percentage price rise simply outweighs the percentage quantity
decline and P  Q = (TR) rises:
If, however, the percentage decline in quantity demanded following a price increase is larger
than the percentage increase in price, total revenue will fall. This occurs when demand is elastic.
The percentage price increase is outweighed by the percentage quantity decline:

CHAPTER 5
Elasticity 107
Review the logic of these equations to make sure you thoroughly understand the reasoning.
Having a responsive (or elastic) market is good when we are lowering price because it means that
we are dramatically increasing our units sold. But that same responsiveness is unattractive as we
contemplate raising prices because now it means that we are losing customers. And, of course, the
reverse logic works in the inelastic market. Note that if there is unitary elasticity, total revenue is
unchanged if the price changes.
With this knowledge, we can now see why reducing supply by the oil-producing countries
was so effective. The demand for oil is inelastic. Restricting the quantity of oil available led to a
huge increase in the price of oil—the percentage increase was larger in absolute value than the
percentage decrease in the quantity of oil demanded. Hence, oil producers’ total revenues went
up. In contrast, a banana cartel would not be effective because the demand for bananas is elastic.
A small increase in the price of bananas results in a large decrease in the quantity of bananas
demanded and thus causes total revenues to fall.
The Determinants of Demand Elasticity
Elasticity of demand is a way of measuring the responsiveness of consumers’ demand to changes
in price. As a measure of behavior, it can be applied to individual households or to market
demand as a whole. You love peaches, and you would hate to give them up. Your demand for
peaches is therefore inelastic. However, not everyone is crazy about peaches; in fact, the market
demand for peaches is relatively elastic. Because no two people have exactly the same preferences,
reactions to price changes will be different for different people, which makes generalizations
risky. Nonetheless, a few principles do seem to hold.
Availability of Substitutes
Perhaps the most obvious factor affecting demand elasticity is the availability of substitutes.
Consider a number of farm stands lined up along a country road. If every stand sells fresh corn of
roughly the same quality, Mom’s Green Thumb will find it very difficult to charge a price much
higher than the competition charges because a nearly perfect substitute is available just down the
road. The demand for Mom’s corn is thus likely to be very elastic: An increase in price will lead to
a rapid decline in the quantity demanded of Mom’s corn.
In the oil versus banana example, the demand for oil is inelastic in large measure due to
the lack of substitutes. When the price of crude oil went up in the early 1970s, 130 million
motor vehicles, getting an average of 12 miles per gallon and consuming over 100 billion gal-
lons of gasoline each year, were on the road in the United States. Millions of homes were
heated with oil, and industry ran on equipment that used petroleum products. When the oil-
producing countries (OPEC) cut production, the price of oil rose sharply. Quantity
demanded fell somewhat, but price increased over 400 percent. What makes the cases of
OPEC and OBEC different is the magnitude of the response in the quantity demanded to a
change of price.
The Importance of Being Unimportant
When an item represents a relatively small part of our total budget, we tend to pay little attention
to its price. For example, if you pick up a pack of mints once in a while, you might not notice an
increase in price from 25 cents to 35 cents. Yet this is a 40 percent increase in price (33.3 percent
using the midpoint formula). In cases such as these, we are not likely to respond very much to
changes in price and demand is likely to be inelastic.

108
PART I
Introduction to Economics
The Time Dimension
When the oil-producing nations first cut output and succeeded in pushing up the price of crude
oil, few substitutes were immediately available. Demand was relatively inelastic, and prices rose
substantially. During the last 30 years, however, there has been some adjustment to higher oil
prices. Automobiles manufactured today get on average more miles per gallon, and some drivers
have cut down on their driving. Millions of home owners have insulated their homes, most people
have turned down their thermostats, and some people have explored alternative energy sources.
Oil prices again rose dramatically during the weeks following Hurricane Katrina in 2005
because of the disruption to oil refineries and oil rigs. Once again, the response of demand to the
resulting higher gasoline prices took place slowly over time. This time many former SUV drivers
switched to hybrids.
All of this illustrates a very important point: The elasticity of demand in the short run may
be very different from the elasticity of demand in the long run. In the longer run, demand is likely
to become more elastic, or responsive, simply because households make adjustments over time
and producers develop substitute goods.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Who Are the Elastic Smokers?
In the United States, taxes are imposed on cigarettes at the state
level. As a result, there are large differences among states. As of July 1,
2010, three states had cigarette taxes in excess of $3.00 per pack:
Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Washington. Seven more had rates
between $2.00 and $3.00 (including the District of Columbia).
Missouri had the lowest rate among the 50 states at $0.17 a pack.
The following article describes a proposal to raise taxes by $1.00 per
pack in the state of Washington.
We would expect an increase in the tax on cigarettes to increase
their price to consumers. An interesting question from the point of
view of health and tax revenue is how much a price increase lowers
demand. One of the commentators in the article claims that
increasing cigarette prices by 10 percent reduces youth smokers by
6–7 percent; this is an implied demand elasticity of –0.6 (6%/10%).
How do you think this compares to what we would expect from
adult smokers? Many people would argue that because more young
people are new smokers and because they have less money than
adults, their demand for cigarettes would be more elastic. On the
other hand, if peer pressure favors smoking, this could lower
demand elasticity for youths.
One problem that states face as they increase their cigarette
taxes is that people will seek cigarette substitutes from cheaper
areas. In Washington, the state pressured Indian tribes to raise 
the tribal tax rate on cigarettes to the overall state level. By mak-
ing these substitutes to state-taxed cigarettes more expensive,
the loss of customers in response to the state tax increase would
be less.
Bill Aims to Raise Tax on Cigarettes
Seattle Times
OLYMPIA—If lawmakers pass a House bill raising the state
cigarette tax to $2.50 a pack, Washington would be the sec-
ond most expensive place in the country to buy cigarettes.
The proposed tax would raise the current $1.425 a
pack by more than a dollar. The additional revenue would
generate an estimated $300 million in two years for the
state’s health-care fund, according to bill sponsors.
Proponents also say the substantial tax would deter
people from smoking, saving nearly $1 billion in future
health-care costs.
Eric Lindblom, manager for policy research at
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said “raising cigarette
prices is one of the quickest, most effective ways to reduce
youth smoking.”
Every time a state increases cigarette taxes by 10 per-
cent, there is a 6 to 7 percent decrease in youth smokers, 
he said.

Elasticity 109
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Elasticities at a Delicatessen in the Short Run and Long Run
Frank runs a corner delicatessen and decides one Monday morning
to raise the prices of his sandwiches by 10 percent. Because Frank
knows a little economics, he expects that this price increase will
cause him to lose some business, since demand curves slope down,
but he decides to try it anyway. At the end of the day, Frank discovers
that his revenue has, in fact, gone up in the sandwich department.
Feeling pleased with himself, Frank hires someone to create signs
showing the new prices for the sandwich department. At the end of
the month, however, he discovers that sandwich revenue is way
down. What is going on?
The first thing to notice about this situation is that it poses a
puzzle about what happens to revenue following a price increase.
Seeing a linkage between price increases (or cuts) and revenue
immediately leads an economist to think about elasticity. We
remember from earlier in the chapter that when demand is elastic,
(that is, an absolute value greater than 1), price increases reduce
revenue because a small price increase will bring a large quantity
decrease, thus depressing revenue. Conversely, when demand is
inelastic (that is, an absolute value less than 1), price increases do
little to curb demand and revenues rise. In this case, Monday’s
price increase brings increases in revenue; therefore, this pattern
tells us that the demand from Frank’s customers appears to be
inelastic. In the longer term, however, demand appears to be more
elastic (revenue is down after a month). Another way to pose this
puzzle is to ask why the monthly demand curve might have a dif-
ferent elasticity than the daily demand.
To answer that question, you need to think about what deter-
mines elasticity. The most fundamental determinant of demand
elasticity is the availability of substitutes. In this case, the product
we are looking at is sandwiches. At first, you might think that the
substitutes for Monday’s sandwich would be the same as the sub-
stitutes for the sandwiches for the rest of the month. But this is
not correct. Once you are in Frank’s store, planning to buy a
sandwich, your demand tends to be relatively inelastic because
your ability to substitute by going elsewhere or choosing a differ-
ent lunch item is relatively limited. You have already come to the
part of town where Frank’s Delicatessen is located, and you may
already have chosen chips and a beverage to go along with your
sandwich. Once you know that Frank’s sandwiches are expensive,
you can make different plans, and this broadening of your substi-
tute choices increases your elasticity. In general, longer-term
demand curves tend to be more elastic than shorter-term curves
because customers have more choices.
The graph below shows the expected relationship between long-
run and short-run demand for Frank’s sandwiches. Notice if you
raise prices above the current level, the expected quantity change
read off the short-run curve is less than that from the long-
run curve.

Other Important Elasticities
So far, we have been discussing price elasticity of demand, which measures the responsive-
ness of quantity demanded to changes in price. However, as we noted earlier, elasticity is a
general concept. If B causes a change in A and we can measure the change in both, we can
calculate the elasticity of A with respect to B. Let us look briefly at three other important
types of elasticity.

110
PART I
Introduction to Economics
income elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded
% change in income
Measuring income elasticity is important for many reasons. Government policy makers
spend a great deal of time and money weighing the relative merits of different policies. During
the 1970s, for example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducted
a huge experiment in four cities to estimate the income elasticity of housing demand. In this
“housing allowance demand experiment,” low-income families received housing vouchers over
an extended period of time and researchers watched their housing consumption for several
years. Most estimates, including the ones from the HUD study, put the income elasticity of
housing demand between 0.5 and 0.8. That is, a 10 percent increase in income can be expected
to raise the quantity of housing demanded by a household by 5 percent to 8 percent.
Income elasticities can be positive or negative. During periods of rising income, people
increase their spending on some goods (positive income elasticity) but reduce their spending on
other goods (negative income elasticity). The income elasticity of demand for jewelry is positive,
while the income elasticity of demand for low-quality beef is negative. As incomes rise in many
low-income countries, the birth rate falls, implying a negative income elasticity of demand for
children. Also, as incomes rise in most countries, the demand for education and health care rises,
a positive income elasticity.
Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
Cross-price elasticity of demand, which measures the response of quantity of one good
demanded to a change in the price of another good, is defined as
Income Elasticity of Demand
Income elasticity of demand, which measures the responsiveness of demand to changes in
income, is defined as
cross-price elasticity of demand = % change in quantity of Y demanded
% change in price of X
Like income elasticity, cross-price elasticity can be either positive or negative. A positive
cross-price elasticity indicates that an increase in the price of X causes the demand for Y to
rise. This implies that the goods are substitutes. For McDonald’s, Big Macs and Chicken
McNuggets are substitutes with a positive cross-price elasticity. In our earlier example, as
McDonald’s lowered the price of Big Macs, it saw a decline in the quantity of McNuggets sold
as consumers substituted between the two meals. If cross-price elasticity turns out to be
negative, an increase in the price of X causes a decrease in the demand for Y. This implies that
the goods are complements. Hot dogs and football games are complements with a negative
cross-price elasticity.
As we have already seen, knowing the cross-price elasticity can be a very important part of a
company’s business strategy. Sony and Toshiba recently competed in the market for high-definition
DVD players: Sony’s Blu-ray versus Toshiba’s HD DVD. Both firms recognized that an impor-
tant driver of a customer’s choice of a DVD player is movie price and availability. No one wants
a new high-definition player if there is nothing to watch on it or if the price of movies is expen-
sive. Inexpensive and available movies are a key complement to new DVD players. The

CHAPTER 5
Elasticity 111
elasticity of supply = % change in quantity supplied
% change in price
elasticity of labor supply = % change in quantity of labor supplied
% change in the wage rate
cross-price elasticity of movies and high-definition DVD players is strong and negative.
Sony won, and some observers think that Sony’s ownership of a movie studio gave it an impor-
tant advantage.
Elasticity of Supply
So far, we have focused on the consumer part of the market. But elasticity also matters on the pro-
ducer’s side.
Elasticity of supply, which measures the response of quantity of a good supplied to a change
in price of that good, is defined as
In output markets, the elasticity of supply is likely to be a positive number—that is, a higher
price leads to an increase in the quantity supplied, ceteris paribus. (Recall our discussion of
upward-sloping supply curves in the preceding two chapters.)
The elasticity of supply is a measure of how easily producers can adapt to a price increase and
bring increased quantities to market. In some industries, it is relatively easy for firms to increase
their output. Ballpoint pens fall into this category, as does most software that has already been
developed. For these products, the elasticity of supply is very high. In the oil industry, supply is
inelastic, much like demand.
In input markets, however, some interesting problems arise in looking at elasticity. Perhaps
the most studied elasticity of all is the elasticity of labor supply, which measures the response of
labor supplied to a change in the price of labor. Economists have examined household labor sup-
ply responses to government programs such as welfare, Social Security, the income tax system,
need-based student aid, and unemployment insurance.
In simple terms, the elasticity of labor supply is defined as
It seems reasonable at first glance to assume that an increase in wages increases the quan-
tity of labor supplied. That would imply an upward-sloping supply curve and a positive labor
supply elasticity, but this is not necessarily so. An increase in wages makes workers better off:
They can work the same number of hours and have higher incomes. One of the things workers
might like to “buy” with that higher income is more leisure time. “Buying” leisure simply
means working fewer hours, and the “price” of leisure is the lost wages. Thus, it is quite possi-
ble that to some groups, an increase in wages above some level will lead to a reduction in the
quantity of labor supplied.
Looking Ahead
The purpose of this chapter was to convince you that measurement is important. If all we can
say is that a change in one economic factor causes another to change, we cannot say whether
the change is important or whether a particular policy is likely to work. The most commonly

PART I
Introduction to Economics
S U M M A R Y
1. Elasticity is a general measure of responsiveness that can
be used to quantify many different relationships. If one
variable A changes in response to changes in another
variable B, the elasticity of A with respect to B is equal to
the percentage change in A divided by the percentage
change in B.
2. The slope of a demand curve is an inadequate measure of
responsiveness because its value depends on the units of
measurement used. For this reason, elasticities are calculated
using percentages.
PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND p. 98
3. Price elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage
change in quantity demanded of a good to the percentage
change in price of that good.
4. Perfectly inelastic demand is demand whose quantity
demanded does not respond at all to changes in price; its
numerical value is zero.
5. Inelastic demand is demand whose quantity demanded
responds somewhat, but not a great deal, to changes in price;
its numerical value is between zero and –1.
6. Elastic demand is demand in which the percentage change
in quantity demanded is larger in absolute value than the
percentage change in price. Its numerical value is less
than –1.
7. Unitary elasticity of demand describes a relationship in
which the percentage change in the quantity of a product
demanded is the same as the percentage change in price;
unitary elasticity has a numerical value of –1.
8. Perfectly elastic demand describes a relationship in 
which a small increase in the price of a product causes 
the quantity demanded for that product to drop 
to zero.
CALCULATING ELASTICITIES p. 100
9. If demand is elastic, a price increase will reduce the
quantity demanded by a larger percentage than the per-
centage increase in price and total revenue (P  Q) will
fall. If demand is inelastic, a price increase will increase
total revenue.
10. If demand is elastic, a price cut will cause quantity
demanded to increase by a greater percentage than the
percentage decrease in price and total revenue will rise.
If demand is inelastic, a price cut will cause quantity
demanded to increase by a smaller percentage than 
the percentage decrease in price and total revenue 
will fall.
THE DETERMINANTS OF DEMAND ELASTICITY p. 107
11. The elasticity of demand depends on (1) the availability of
substitutes, (2) the importance of the item in individual
budgets, and (3) the time frame in question.
OTHER IMPORTANT ELASTICITIES p. 109
12. There are several important elasticities. Income elasticity
of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity
demanded with respect to changes in income. Cross-price
elasticity of demand measures the response of the quantity
of one good demanded to a change in the price of another
good. Elasticity of supply measures the response of the
quantity of a good supplied to a change in the price of
that good. The elasticity of labor supply measures the
response of the quantity of labor supplied to a change in
the price of labor.

Recall that households demand goods and services in product markets but supply labor and sav-
ings in input or factor markets.

50%, buyers will spend less on cocaine.
b. Every year Christmas tree vendors bring tens of thousands of
trees from the forests of New England to New York City and
Boston. During the last two years, the market has been very

enues altogether as a result of the price decline.

gasoline at the pump at -0.20. Suppose that international hos-

9. Prior to 2005, it seemed like house prices always rose and never
fell. When the demand for housing increases, prices in the
housing market rise but not always by very much. For prices to
rise substantially, the supply of housing must be relatively
inelastic. That is, if the quantity supplied increases rapidly
whenever house prices rise, price increases will remain small.
Many have suggested government policies to increase the elas-
ticity of supply. What specific policies might hold prices down
when demand increases? Explain.

and state what its value should be (negative, positive, greater

rising incomes just slightly faster than income rises.
c. The demand for lobsters falls when lobster prices rise (ceteris
paribus), but the revenue received by restaurants from the
sale of lobsters stays the same.
d. Demand for many goods rise when the price of substi-
tutes rise.
e. Land for housing development near Youngstown, Ohio, is in
plentiful supply. At the current price, there is essentially an
infinite supply.
11. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 108] A number
of towns in the United States have begun charging their resi-
dents for garbage pickup based on the number of garbage cans
filled per week. The town of Chase decided to increase its per-
can price from 10 cents to 20 cents per week. In the first week,
Chase found that the number of cans that were brought to the
curb fell from 550 to 525 (although the city workers com-
plained that the cans were heavier). The town economist ran
the numbers, informed the mayor that the demand for dis-
posal was inelastic, and recommended that the city raise the
price more to maximize town revenue from the program. Six
months later, at a price of 30 cents per can, the number of cans
has fallen to 125 and town revenues are down. What might
have happened?
12. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 109] At Frank’s

the number of yogurts sold went up. How might you explain
this pattern?

CHAPTER 5 APPENDIX
Point Elasticity (Optional)
Two different elasticities were calculated along the demand
curve in Figure 5.3 on p. 104. Between points A and B, we dis-
covered that Herb’s demand for lunches in the fancy dining
room was very elastic: A price decline of only 10.5 percent
resulted in his eating 66.7 percent more lunches in the dining
room (elasticity = -6.4). Between points C and D, however, on
the same demand curve, we discovered that his demand for
meals was very inelastic: A price decline of 40 percent resulted
in only a modest increase in lunches consumed of 11.76 percent
(elasticity = -0.294).
Now consider the straight-line demand curve in Figure 5A.1.
We can write an expression for elasticity at point C as follows:
Q/ P is the reciprocal of the slope of the curve. Slope in
the diagram is constant along the curve, and it is negative. To
calculate the reciprocal of the slope to plug into the previous
elasticity equation, we take Q1B, or M1, and divide by minus
the length of line segment CQ1. Thus,

PART I
Introduction to Economics
By substituting, we get
(The second equal sign uses the fact that Q1 equals M2 in
Figure 5A.1.)
Elasticity at point C is simply the ratio of line segment M1
to line segment M2. It is easy to see that if we had chosen a point
to the left of Q1, M1 would have been larger and M2 would have
been smaller, indicating a higher elasticity. If we had chosen a
point to the right of Q1, M1 would have been smaller and M2
would have been larger, indicating a lower elasticity.
In Figure 5A.2, you can see that elasticity is unitary (equal 
to -1) at the midpoint of the demand curve, Q3. At points to the
right, such as Q2, segment Q2C (M1 from Figure 5A.1) is smaller
than segment 0Q1 (M2 from Figure 5A.1). This means that the
absolute size of the ratio is less than 1 and that demand is inelastic
at point A. At points to the left, such as Q1, segment Q1C (M1) is
larger than segment 0Q1 (M2). This means that the absolute size
of the ratio is greater than 1 and that demand is elastic at point B.
Compare the results here with the results using the mid-
point formula for elasticity for Herb.

holds and firms.

expanded version of the circular flow diagram first presented in Figure 3.1 on p. 49. It is

big picture more clearly if you follow this diagram closely as you work your way through this
part of the book.
Recall that households and firms interact in two kinds of markets: output (product)
markets, shown at the top of Figure II.1, and input (factor) markets, shown at the bottom.
Households demand outputs and supply inputs. In contrast, firms supply outputs and
demand inputs. Chapter 6 explores the behavior of households, focusing first on household
demand for outputs and then on household supply in labor and capital markets.
The remaining chapters in Part II focus on firms and the interaction between firms and
households. Chapters 7 through 9 analyze the behavior of firms in output markets in both
the short run and the long run. Chapter 10 focuses on the behavior of firms in input markets
in general, especially the labor and land markets. Chapter 11 discusses the capital market in
more detail. Chapter 12 puts all the pieces together and analyzes the functioning of a com-
plete market system. Following Chapter 12, Part III of the book relaxes many assumptions
and analyzes market imperfections as well as the potential for and pitfalls of government
involvement in the economy. The plan for Chapters 6 through 19 is outlined in Figure II.2.
Recall that throughout this book, all diagrams that describe the behavior of households
are drawn or highlighted in blue. All diagrams that describe the behavior of firms are drawn
or highlighted in red. Look carefully at the supply and demand diagrams in Figure II.1;
notice that in both the labor and capital markets, the supply curves are blue. The reason is
that labor and capital are supplied by households. The demand curves for labor and capital
are red because firms demand these inputs for production.

To understand how the economy works, it helps to build from the ground up. We start in Chapters 6–8
with an overview of household and firm decision making in simple perfectly competitive markets. In
Chapters 9–11, we see how firms and households interact in output markets (product markets) and input
markets (labor/land and capital) to determine prices, wages, and profits. Once we have a picture of how a
simple perfectly competitive economy works, we begin to relax assumptions. Chapter 12 is a pivotal chapter
that links perfectly competitive markets with a discussion of market imperfections and the role of govern-
ment. In Chapters 13–19, we cover the three noncompetitive market structures (monopoly, monopolistic
competition, and oligopoly), externalities, public goods, uncertainty and asymmetric information, and
income distribution as well as taxation and government finance.

In Figure II.1, much of the detail of the real world is stripped away just as it is on a
highway map. A map is a highly simplified version of reality, but it is a very useful tool
when you need to know where you are. Figure II.1 is intended to serve as a map to help
you understand basic market forces before we add more complicated market structures
and government.
Before we proceed with our discussion of household choice, we need to make a few
basic assumptions. These assumptions pertain to Chapters 6 through 12.
We first assume that households and firms possess all the information they need to
make market choices. Specifically, we assume that households possess knowledge of the
qualities and prices of everything available in the market. Firms know all that there is to
know about wage rates, capital costs, and output prices. This assumption is often called the
assumption of perfect knowledge.
The next assumption is perfect competition. Perfect competition is a precisely defined
form of industry structure. (The word perfect here does not refer to virtue. It simply means
“total” or “complete.”) In a perfectly competitive industry, no single firm has control over
prices. That is, no single firm is large enough to affect the market price of its product or the
prices of the inputs that it buys. This follows from two characteristics of competitive indus-
tries. First, a competitive industry is composed of many firms, each one small relative to the
size of the industry. Second, every firm in a perfectly competitive industry produces exactly
the same product; the output of one firm cannot be distinguished from the output of the
others. Products in a perfectly competitive industry are said to be homogeneous.
These characteristics limit the decisions open to competitive firms and simplify the
analysis of competitive behavior. Because all firms in a perfectly competitive industry pro-
duce virtually identical products and because each firm is small relative to the market, per-
fectly competitive firms have no control over the prices at which they sell their output. By
taking prices as a given, each firm can decide only how much output to produce and how to
produce it.
Consider agriculture, the classic example of a perfectly competitive industry. A wheat
farmer in South Dakota has absolutely no control over the price of wheat. Prices are deter-
mined not by the individual farmers, but by the interaction of many suppliers and many
demanders. The only decisions left to the wheat farmer are how much wheat to plant and
when and how to produce the crop.
We finally assume that each household is small relative to the size of the market.
Households face a set of product prices that they individually cannot control. Prices again
are set by the interaction of many suppliers and many demanders.
By the end of Chapter 10, we will have a complete picture of an economy, but it will be
based on this set of fairly restrictive assumptions. At first, this may seem unrealistic to you,
but keep the following in mind. Much of the economic analysis in the chapters that follow
applies to all forms of market structure. Indeed, much of the power of economic reasoning
is that it is quite general. As we continue in microeconomics, in Chapters 13 and 14, we will
define and explore several different kinds of market organization and structure, including
monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition. Because monopolists, oligopolists,
monopolistic competitors, and perfect competitors share the objective of maximizing prof-
its, it should not be surprising that their behavior is in many ways similar. We focus here on
perfect competition because many of these basic principles are easier to learn using the sim-
plest of cases.

Every day people in a market econ-
omy make decisions. Some of those
decisions involve the products they
plan to buy: Should you buy a Coke
for lunch, a bottle of tea, or just
drink water? Should you purchase a
laptop computer or stick with your
old desktop? Some decisions are
about the labor market: Should you
continue your schooling or go to
work instead? If you do start work-
ing, how much should you work?
Should you work more when you
get a raise or just take it easy? Many
decisions involve a time element. If you decide to buy a laptop, you may have to use your savings
or borrow money. That will leave you with fewer choices about what you can buy in the future. On
the other hand, the laptop itself is an investment.
To many people, the decisions listed in the previous paragraph seem very different from one
another.As you will see in this chapter, however, from an economics perspective, these decisions have
a great deal in common. In this chapter, we will develop a set of principles that can be used to under-
stand decisions in the product market and the labor market—decisions for today and for the future.
As you read this chapter, you might want to think about some of the following questions, ques-
tions that you will be able to answer by chapter’s end. Baseball, even when it was more popular than it
is today, was never played year-round. Indeed, no professional sport has a year-round season. Is this
break necessary to give the athletes a rest, or is there something about household choice that helps
explain this pattern? When the price of gasoline rises,people drive less,but one study suggests that they
also switch from brand name products to generics or store brands.1 Why might this be? Studying
household choice will help you understand many decisions that underpin our market economy.
A constant theme that will run through the analysis is the idea of constrained choice. That is,
the decisions that we make we make under constraints that exist in the marketplace. Household
consumption choices are constrained by income, wealth, and existing prices. Household deci-
sions about labor supply and job choice are clearly constrained by the availability of jobs. This
was on everyone’s minds when the number of unemployed reached 15 million and the unem-
ployment rate hovered at about 10 percent during the 2009–2010 period. In addition, the choices
we make in the workforce are constrained by the existing structure of market wages.
Household Choice in Output Markets
Every household must make three basic decisions:
1. How much of each product, or output, to demand
2. How much labor to supply
3. How much to spend today and how much to save for the future

As we begin our look at demand in output markets, you must keep in mind that the choices
underlying the demand curve are only part of the larger household choice problem. Closely
related decisions about how much to work and how much to save are equally important and must
be made simultaneously with output–demand decisions.
The Determinants of Household Demand
As we saw in Chapter 3, several factors influence the quantity of a given good or service
demanded by a single household:
 The price of the product
 The income available to the household
 The household’s amount of accumulated wealth
 The prices of other products available to the household
 The household’s tastes and preferences
 The household’s expectations about future income, wealth, and prices
Recall that demand schedules and demand curves express the relationship between quantity
demanded and price, ceteris paribus. A change in price leads to a movement along a demand
curve. Changes in income, in other prices, or in preferences shift demand curves to the left or
right. We refer to these shifts as “changes in demand.”However, the interrelationship among these
variables is more complex than the simple exposition in Chapter 3 might lead you to believe.
122
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
The Budget Constraint
Before we examine the household choice process, we need to discuss what choices are open and
not open to households. If you look carefully at the list of items that influence household demand,
you will see that the first four actually define the set of options available. Information on house-
hold income and wealth, together with information on product prices, makes it possible to distin-
guish those combinations of goods and services that are affordable from those that are not.2
Income, wealth, and prices thus define what we call household budget constraint. The bud-
get constraint facing any household results primarily from limits imposed externally by one or
more markets. In competitive markets, for example, households cannot control prices; they must
buy goods and services at market-determined prices. A household has some control over its
income: Its members can choose whether to work, and they can sometimes decide how many
hours to work and how many jobs to hold. However, constraints exist in the labor market too.
The amount that household members are paid is limited by current market wage rates. Whether
they can get a job is determined by the availability of jobs.
Although income does depend, at least in part, on the choices that households make, we will
treat it as a given for now. Later in this chapter, we will relax this assumption and explore labor
supply choices in more detail.
The income, wealth, and price constraints that surround choice are best illustrated with an
example. Consider Barbara, a recent graduate of a midwestern university who takes a job as an
account manager at a public relations firm. Let us assume that she receives a salary of $1,000 per
month (after taxes) and that she has no wealth and no credit. Barbara’s monthly expenditures are
limited to her flow of income. Table 6.1 summarizes some of the choices open to her.

product prices.
2 Remember that we drew the distinction between income and wealth in Chapter 3. Income is the sum of household earnings
within a given period; it is a flow variable. In contrast, wealth is a stock variable; it is what a household owns minus what it owes
at a given point in time.

A careful search of the housing market reveals four vacant apartments. The least expensive is
a one-room studio with a small kitchenette that rents for $400 per month, including utilities
(option A). If she lived there, Barbara could afford to spend $250 per month on food and still
have $350 left over for other things.
About four blocks away is a one-bedroom apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting and a
larger kitchen. It has more space, but the rent is $600, including utilities. If Barbara took this
apartment, she might cut her food expenditures by $50 per month and have only $200 per month
left for everything else.
In the same building as the one-bedroom apartment is an identical unit on the top floor of the
building with a balcony facing west toward the sunset. The balcony and view add $100 to the monthly
rent. To live there, Barbara would be left with only $300 to split between food and other expenses.
Just because she was curious, Barbara looked at a town house in the suburbs that was renting
for $1,000 per month. Obviously, unless she could get along without eating or doing anything
else that cost money, she could not afford it. The combination of the town house and any amount
of food is outside her budget constraint.
Notice that we have used the information that we have on income and prices to identify dif-
ferent combinations of housing, food, and other items that are available to a single-person house-
hold with an income of $1,000 per month. We have said nothing about the process of choosing.
Instead, we have carved out what is called a choice set or opportunity set, the set of options that
is defined and limited by Barbara’s budget constraint.
Preferences, Tastes, Trade-Offs, and Opportunity Cost
So far, we have identi-
fied only the combinations of goods and services that are and are not available to Barbara. Within
the constraints imposed by limited incomes and fixed prices, however, households are free to
choose what they will and will not buy. Their ultimate choices are governed by their individual
preferences and tastes.
It will help you to think of the household choice process as a process of allocating income
over a large number of available goods and services. Final demand of a household for any single
product is just one of many outcomes that result from the decision-making process. Think, for
example, of a demand curve that shows a household’s reaction to a drop in the price of air travel.
During certain periods when people travel less frequently, special fares flood the market and
many people decide to take trips that they otherwise would not have taken. However, if you live in
Florida and decide to spend $400 to visit your mother in Nashville, you cannot spend that $400
on new clothes, dinners at restaurants, or a new set of tires.
A change in the price of a single good changes the constraints within which households choose,
and this may change the entire allocation of income. Demand for some goods and services may rise
while demand for others falls. A complicated set of trade-offs lies behind the shape and position of
a household demand curve for a single good. Whenever a household makes a choice, it is weighing
the good or service that it chooses against all the other things that the same money could buy.
Consider again our young account manager and her options listed in Table 6.1. If she hates
to cook, likes to eat at restaurants, and goes out three nights a week, she will probably trade off
some housing for dinners out and money to spend on clothes and other things. She will probably
rent the studio for $400. She may, however, love to spend long evenings at home reading, listen-
ing to classical music, and sipping tea while watching the sunset. In that case, she will probably
trade off some restaurant meals, evenings out, and travel expenses for the added comfort of the
larger apartment with the balcony and the view. As long as a household faces a limited budget—
and all households ultimately do—the real cost of any good or service is the value of the other
goods and services that could have been purchased with the same amount of money. The real cost
of a good or service is its opportunity cost, and opportunity cost is determined by relative prices.
The Budget Constraint More Formally
Ann and Tom are struggling graduate stu-
dents in economics at the University of Virginia. Their tuition is paid by graduate fellowships.
They live as resident advisers in a first-year dormitory, in return for which they receive an apart-
ment and meals. Their fellowships also give them $200 each month to cover all their other
expenses. To simplify things, let us assume that Ann and Tom spend their money on only two
things: meals at a local Thai restaurant and nights at a local jazz club, The Hungry Ear. Thai meals
go for a fixed price of $20 per couple. Two tickets to the jazz club, including espresso, are $10.
As Figure 6.1 shows, we can graphically depict the choices that are available to our dynamic
duo. The axes measure the quantities of the two goods that Ann and Tom buy. The horizontal axis

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
measures the number of Thai meals consumed per month, and the vertical axis measures the
number of trips to The Hungry Ear. (Note that price is not on the vertical axis here.) Every point
in the space between the axes represents some combination of Thai meals and nights at the jazz
club. The question is this: Which of these points can Ann and Tom purchase with a fixed budget
of $200 per month? That is, which points are in the opportunity set and which are not?
One possibility is that the students in the dorm are driving Ann and Tom crazy. The two grad
students want to avoid the dining hall at all costs. Thus, they might decide to spend all their
money on Thai food and none of it on jazz. This decision would be represented by a point on the
horizontal axis because all the points on that axis are points at which Ann and Tom make no jazz
club visits. How many meals can Ann and Tom afford? The answer is simple: When income is
$200 and the price of Thai meals is $20, they can afford $200  $20 = 10 meals. This point is
labeled A on the budget constraint in Figure 6.1.
Another possibility is that general exams are coming up and Ann and Tom decide to relax at
The Hungry Ear to relieve stress. Suppose they choose to spend all their money on jazz and none
of it on Thai food. This decision would be represented by a point on the vertical axis because all
the points on this axis are points at which Ann and Tom eat no Thai meals. How many jazz club
visits can they afford? Again, the answer is simple: With an income of $200 and with the price of
jazz/espresso at $10, they can go to The Hungry Ear $200  $10 = 20 times. This is the point
labeled B in Figure 6.1. The line connecting points A and B is Ann and Tom’s budget constraint.
What about all the points between A and B on the budget constraint? Starting from point B,sup-
pose Ann and Tom give up trips to the jazz club to buy more Thai meals. Each additional Thai meal
“costs”two trips to The Hungry Ear. The opportunity cost of a Thai meal is two jazz club trips.
Point C on the budget constraint represents a compromise. Here Ann and Tom go to the club
10 times and eat at the Thai restaurant 5 times. To verify that point C is on the budget constraint,
price it out: 10 jazz club trips cost a total of $10  10 = $100, and 5 Thai meals cost a total of
$20  5 = $100. The total is $100 + $100 = $200.
The budget constraint divides all the points between the axes into two groups: those that can
be purchased for $200 or less (the opportunity set) and those that are unavailable. Point D on the
diagram costs less than $200; point E costs more than $200. (Verify that this is true.) The oppor-
tunity set is the shaded area in Figure 6.1.
Clearly, both prices and incomes affect the size of a household’s opportunity set. If a price or a set
of prices falls but income stays the same, the opportunity set gets bigger and the household is better
off. If we define real income as the set of opportunities to purchase real goods and services, “real
income” will have gone up in this case even if the household’s money income has not. A consumer’s
opportunity set expands as the result of a price decrease. On the other hand, when money income
increases and prices go up even more, we say that the household’s “real income”has fallen.
The concept of real income is very important in macroeconomics, which is concerned with
measuring real output and the price level.

The Equation of the Budget Constraint
Yet another way to look at the budget constraint is to write the consumer’s problem as an equation.
In the previous example, the constraint is that total expenditure on Thai meals plus total expendi-
ture on jazz club visits must be less than or equal to Ann and Tom’s income. Total expenditure on
Thai meals is equal to the price of Thai meals times the number, or quantity, of meals consumed.
Total expenditure on jazz club visits is equal to the price of a visit times the number, or quantity, of
visits. That is,
$20
Thai meals + $10
jazz visits
$200
If we let X represent the number of Thai meals and we let Y represent the number of jazz club
visits and we assume that Ann and Tom spend their entire income on either X or Y, this can be
written as follows:
20X + 10Y = $200
This is the equation of the budget constraint—the line connecting points A and B in Figure 6.1.
Notice that when Ann and Tom spend nothing at the jazz club, Y = 0. When you plug Y = 0 into the
equation of the budget constraint, 20X = 200 and X = 10. Since X is the number of Thai meals,Ann
and Tom eat Thai food 10 times. Similarly, when X = 0, you can solve for Y, which equals 20. When
Ann and Tom eat no Thai food, they can go to the jazz club 20 times.
In general, the budget constraint can be written
PXX + PYY = I,
where PX = the price of X, X = the quantity of X consumed, PY = the price of Y, Y = the quan-
tity of Y consumed, and I = household income.3
Budget Constraints Change When Prices Rise or Fall
Now suppose the Thai
restaurant is offering two-for-one certificates good during the month of November. In effect, this
means that the price of Thai meals drops to $10 for Ann and Tom. How would the budget con-
straint in Figure 6.1 change?
First, point B would not change. If Ann and Tom spend all their money on jazz, the price of
Thai meals is irrelevant. Ann and Tom can still afford only 20 trips to the jazz club. What has
changed is point A, which moves to point A' in Figure 6.2. At the new lower price of $10, if Ann
and Tom spent all their money on Thai meals, they could buy twice as many, $200  $10 = 20.
The budget constraint swivels, as shown in Figure 6.2.
…

CHAPTER 6    Household Behavior and Consumer Choice 125
3 You can calculate the slope of the budget constraint as –PX/PY, the ratio of the price of X to the price of Y. This gives the trade-
off that consumers face. In the example, –PX/PY = –2, meaning to get another Thai meal, Ann and Tom must give up two trips to
the jazz club.

Notice that when the price of meals falls to $10, the equation of the budget constraint changes

The range of goods and services available in a modern society is as vast as consumer tastes
are variable, and this makes any generalization about the household choice process risky.
Nonetheless, the theory of household behavior that follows is an attempt to derive some logical
propositions about the way households make choices.
The Basis of Choice: Utility
Somehow, from the millions of things that are available, each of us manages to sort out a set of
goods and services to buy. When we make our choices, we make specific judgments about the rel-
ative worth of things that are very different.
During the nineteenth century, the weighing of values was formalized into a concept called util-
ity. Whether one item is preferable to another depends on how much utility, or satisfaction, it yields
relative to its alternatives. How do we decide on the relative worth of a new puppy or a stereo? a trip
to the mountains or a weekend in New York City? working or not working? As we make our choices,
we are effectively weighing the utilities we would receive from all the possible available goods.
Certain problems are implicit in the concept of utility. First, it is impossible to measure util-
ity. Second, it is impossible to compare the utilities of different people—that is, we cannot say
whether person A or person B has a higher level of utility. Despite these problems, however, the
idea of utility helps us better understand the process of choice.
Diminishing Marginal Utility
In making their choices, most people spread their incomes over many different kinds of goods.
One reason people prefer variety is that consuming more and more of any one good reduces the
marginal, or extra, satisfaction they get from further consumption of the same good. Formally,
marginal utility (MU) is the additional satisfaction gained by the consumption or use of one
more unit of a good or service.
It is important to distinguish marginal utility from total utility. Total utility is the total
amount of satisfaction obtained from consumption of a good or service. Marginal utility comes
only from the last unit consumed; total utility comes from all units consumed.
Suppose you live next to a store that sells homemade ice cream that you are crazy about. Even
though you get a great deal of pleasure from eating ice cream, you do not spend your entire
income on it. The first cone of the day tastes heavenly. The second is merely delicious. The third
is still very good, but it is clear that the glow is fading. Why? The answer is because the more of
any one good we consume in a given period, the less satisfaction, or utility, we get from each addi-
tional, or marginal, unit. In 1890, Alfred Marshall called this “familiar and fundamental tendency
of human nature” the law of diminishing marginal utility.
Consider this simple example. Frank loves country music, and a country band is playing
seven nights a week at a club near his house. Table 6.2 shows how the utility he derives from the
band might change as he goes to the club more frequently. The first visit generates 12 “utils,” or
units of utility. When Frank goes back another night, he enjoys it, but not quite as much as the
first night. The second night by itself yields 10 additional utils. Marginal utility is 10, while the
total utility derived from two nights at the club is 22. Three nights per week at the club provide 
28 total utils; the marginal utility of the third night is 6 because total utility rose from 22 to 28.

period, the less satisfaction

same good.
The new, flatter budget constraint reflects the new trade-off between Thai meals and Hungry
Ear visits. Now after the price of Thai meals drops to $10, the opportunity cost of a Thai meal is
only one jazz club visit. The opportunity set has expanded because at the lower price, more com-
binations of Thai meals and jazz are available.
Figure 6.2 thus illustrates a very important point. When the price of a single good changes,
more than just the quantity demanded of that good may be affected. The household now faces an
entirely different problem with regard to choice—the opportunity set has expanded. At the same
income of $200, the new lower price means that Ann and Tom might choose more Thai meals,
more jazz club visits, or more of both. They are clearly better off. The budget constraint is defined
by income, wealth, and prices. Within those limits, households are free to choose, and the house-
hold’s ultimate choice depends on its own likes and dislikes.

through Frank’s fifth trip to the club but levels off on the sixth night. Marginal utility, which has
declined from the beginning, is now at zero.
Diminishing marginal utility helps explain the reason most sports have limited seasons. Even
rabid fans have had enough baseball by late October. Given this fact, it would be hard to sell out
ball games for a year-round season. While diminishing marginal utility is a simple and intuitive
idea, it has great power in helping us understand the economic world.
Allocating Income to Maximize Utility
How many times in one week would Frank go to the club to hear his favorite band? The answer
depends on three things: Frank’s income, the price of admission to the club, and the alternatives
available. If the price of admission was zero and no alternatives existed, he would probably go to

the club five nights a week. (Remember, the sixth night does not increase his utility, so why should
he bother to go?) However, Frank is also a basketball fan. His city has many good high school and
college teams, and he can go to games six nights a week if he so chooses.
Let us say for now that admission to both the country music club and the basketball games is
free—that is, there is no price/income constraint. There is a time constraint, however, because
there are only seven nights in a week. Table 6.3 lists Frank’s total and marginal utilities from
attending basketball games and going to country music clubs. From column 3 of the table, we can
conclude that on the first night, Frank will go to a basketball game. The game is worth far more to
him (21 utils) than a trip to the club (12 utils).
On the second night, Frank’s decision is not so easy. Because he has been to one basketball
game this week, the second game is worth less (12 utils as compared to 21 for the first basketball
game). In fact, because it is worth the same as a first trip to the club, he is indifferent as to whether
he goes to the game or the club. So he splits the next two nights: One night he sees ball game
number two (12 utils); the other night he spends at the club (12 utils). At this point, Frank has
been to two ball games and has spent one night at the club. Where will Frank go on evening four?
He will go to the club again because the marginal utility from a second trip to the club (10 utils)
is greater than the marginal utility from attending a third basketball game (9 utils).
Frank is splitting his time between the two activities to maximize total utility. At each succes-
sive step, he chooses the activity that yields the most marginal utility. Continuing with this logic,
you can see that spending three nights at the club and four nights watching basketball produces
total utility of 76 utils each week (28 plus 48). No other combination of games and club trips can
produce as much utility.
So far, the only cost of a night of listening to country music is a forgone basketball game and
the only cost of a basketball game is a forgone night of country music. Now let us suppose that it
costs $3 to get into the club and $6 to go to a basketball game. Suppose further that after paying
rent and taking care of other expenses, Frank has only $21 left to spend on entertainment.
Typically, consumers allocate limited incomes, or budgets, over a large set of goods and services.
Here we have a limited income ($21) being allocated between only two goods, but the principle is
the same. Income ($21) and prices ($3 and $6) define Frank’s budget constraint. Within that con-
straint, Frank chooses to maximize utility.
Because the two activities now cost different amounts, we need to find the marginal utility
per dollar spent on each activity. If Frank is to spend his money on the combination of activities
lying within his budget constraint that gives him the most total utility, each night he must choose
the activity that gives him the most utility per dollar spent. As you can see from column 5 in
Table 6.3, Frank gets 4 utils per dollar on the first night he goes to the club (12 utils  $3 = 4 utils
per dollar). On night two, he goes to a game and gets 3.5 utils per dollar (21 utils  $6 = 3.5 utils
per dollar). On night three, it is back to the club. Then what happens? When all is said and
done—work this out for yourself—Frank ends up going to two games and spending three nights
at the club. No other combination of activities that $21 will buy yields more utility.

CHAPTER 6
Household Behavior and Consumer Choice 129
The Utility-Maximizing Rule
In general, utility-maximizing consumers spread out their expenditures until the following con-
dition holds:
where MUX is the marginal utility derived from the last unit of X consumed, MUY is the
marginal utility derived from the last unit of Y consumed, PX is the price per unit of X, and
PY is the price per unit of Y.
To see why this utility-maximizing rule is true, think for a moment about what would hap-
pen if it were not true. For example, suppose MUX/PX was greater than MUY/PY; that is, suppose
a consumer purchased a bundle of goods so that the marginal utility from the last dollar spent on
X was greater than the marginal utility from the last dollar spent on Y. This would mean that the
consumer could increase his or her utility by spending a dollar less on Y and a dollar more on X.
As the consumer shifts to buying more X and less Y, he or she runs into diminishing marginal
utility. Buying more units of X decreases the marginal utility derived from consuming additional
units of X. As a result, the marginal utility of another dollar spent on X falls. Now less is being
spent on Y, and that means its marginal utility increases. This process continues until MUX/PX =
MUY/PY. When this condition holds, there is no way for the consumer to increase his or her util-
ity by changing the bundle of goods purchased.
You can see how the utility-maximizing rule works in Frank’s choice between country music
and basketball. At each stage, Frank chooses the activity that gives him the most utility per dollar.
If he goes to a game, the utility he will derive from the next game—marginal utility—falls. If he
goes to the club, the utility he will derive from his next visit falls, and so on.
The principles we have been describing help us understand an old puzzle dating from the time
of Plato and familiar to economists beginning with Adam Smith.Adam Smith wrote about it in 1776:
The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in
exchange; and on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have fre-
quently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase
scarce anything; scarce anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the con-
trary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may fre-
quently be had in exchange for it.4
Although diamonds have arguably more than “scarce any value in use” today (for example,
they are used to cut glass), Smith’s diamond/water paradox is still instructive, at least where
water is concerned.
The low price of water owes much to the fact that it is in plentiful supply. Even at a price of
zero, we do not consume an infinite amount of water. We consume up to the point where
marginal utility drops to zero. The marginal value of water is zero. Each of us enjoys an enormous
consumer surplus when we consume nearly free water. At a price of zero, consumer surplus is the
entire area under the demand curve. We tend to take water for granted, but imagine what would
happen to its price if there were not enough for everyone. It would command a high price indeed.
Diminishing Marginal Utility and Downward-Sloping
Demand
The concept of diminishing marginal utility offers one reason people spread their incomes over a
variety of goods and services instead of spending all income on one or two items. It also leads us
to conclude that demand curves slope downward.
To see why this is so, let us return to our friends Ann and Tom, the struggling graduate stu-
dents. Recall that they chose between meals at a Thai restaurant and trips to a jazz club. Now
think about their demand curve for Thai meals, shown in Figure 6.4. When the price of a meal is
$40, they decide not to buy any Thai meals. What they are really deciding is that the utility gained

from even that first scrumptious meal each month is not worth the utility that would come from
the other things that $40 can buy.
Now consider a price of $25. At this price, Ann and Tom buy five Thai meals. The first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth meals each generate enough utility to justify the price. Tom and Ann “reveal”
this by buying five meals.After the fifth meal, the utility gained from the next meal is not worth $25.
Ultimately, every demand curve hits the quantity (horizontal) axis as a result of diminishing
marginal utility—in other words, demand curves slope downward. How many times will Ann
and Tom go to the Thai restaurant if meals are free? Twenty-five times is the answer; and after 
25 times a month, they are so sick of Thai food that they will not eat any more even if it is free.
That is, marginal utility—the utility gained from the last meal—has dropped to zero. If you think
this is unrealistic, ask yourself how much water you drank today.
Income and Substitution Effects
Although the idea of utility is a helpful way of thinking about the choice process, there is an
explanation for downward-sloping demand curves that does not rely on the concept of utility or
the assumption of diminishing marginal utility. This explanation centers on income and substi-
tution effects.
Keeping in mind that consumers face constrained choices, consider the probable response of
a household to a decline in the price of some heavily used product, ceteris paribus. How might a
household currently consuming many goods be likely to respond to a fall in the price of one of
those goods if the household’s income, its preferences, and all other prices remained unchanged?
The household would face a new budget constraint, and its final choice of all goods and services
might change. A decline in the price of gasoline, for example, may affect not only how much
gasoline you purchase but also what kind of car you buy, when and how much you travel, where
you go, and (not so directly) how many movies you see this month and how many projects
around the house you get done.
The Income Effect
Price changes affect households in two ways. First, if we assume that households confine their
choices to products that improve their well-being, then a decline in the price of any product, ceteris
paribus, will make the household unequivocally better off. In other words, if a household contin-
ues to buy the same amount of every good and service after the price decrease, it will have income

Sloping Demand
At a price of $40, the utility
gained from even the first Thai
meal is not worth the price.
However, a lower price of $25
lures Ann and Tom into the Thai
restaurant 5 times a month. (The
utility from the sixth meal is not
worth $25.) If the price is $15,
Ann and Tom will eat Thai meals
10 times a month—until the mar-
ginal utility of a Thai meal drops

left over. That extra income may be spent on the product whose price has declined, hereafter called
good X, or on other products. The change in consumption of X due to this improvement in well-
being is called the income effect of a price change.
Suppose you live in Florida and four times a year you fly to Nashville to visit your mother.
Suppose further that last year a round-trip ticket to Nashville cost $400. Thus, you spend a total
of $1,600 per year on trips to visit Mom. This year, however, increased competition among the
airlines has led one airline to offer round-trip tickets to Nashville for $200. Assuming the price
remains $200 all year, you can now fly home the same number of times and you will have spent
$800 less for airline tickets than you did last year. Now that you are better off, you have additional
opportunities. You can fly home a fifth time this year, leaving $600 ($800
$200) to spend on
other things, or you can fly home the same number of times (four) and spend the extra $800 on
other things. When the price of something we buy falls, we are better off. When the price of some-
thing we buy rises, we are worse off.
Look back at Figure 6.2 on p. 125. When the price of Thai meals fell, the opportunity set fac-
ing Tom and Ann expanded—they were able to afford more Thai meals, more jazz club trips, or
more of both. They were unequivocally better off because of the price decline. In a sense, their
“real” income was higher.
Now recall from Chapter 3 the definition of a normal good. When income rises, demand for
normal goods increases. Most goods are normal goods. Because of the price decline, Tom and
Ann can afford to buy more. If Thai food is a normal good, a decline in the price of Thai food
should lead to an increase in the quantity demanded of Thai food.
The Substitution Effect
The fact that a price decline leaves households better off is only part of the story. When the price
of a product falls, that product also becomes relatively cheaper. That is, it becomes more attractive
relative to potential substitutes. A fall in the price of product X might cause a household to shift
its purchasing pattern away from substitutes toward X. This shift is called the substitution effect of
a price change.
Earlier we made the point that the “real” cost or price of a good is what one must sacrifice to
consume it. This opportunity cost is determined by relative prices. To see why this is so, consider
again the choice that you face when a round-trip ticket to Nashville costs $400. Each trip that you
take requires a sacrifice of $400 worth of other goods and services. When the price drops to $200,
the opportunity cost of a ticket has dropped by $200. In other words, after the price decline, you
have to sacrifice only $200 (instead of $400) worth of other goods and services to visit Mom.
To clarify the distinction between the income and substitution, imagine how you would be
affected if two things happened to you at the same time. First, the price of round-trip air travel
between Florida and Nashville drops from $400 to $200. Second, your income is reduced by $800.
You are now faced with new relative prices, but—assuming you flew home four times last year—
you are no better off now than you were before the price of a ticket declined. The decrease in the
price of air travel has offset your decrease in income.
You are still likely to take more trips home. Why? The opportunity cost of a trip home is now
lower, ceteris paribus, assuming no change in the prices of other goods and services. A trip to
Nashville now requires a sacrifice of only $200 worth of other goods and services, not the $400 worth
that it did before. Thus, you will substitute away from other goods toward trips to see your mother.
Everything works in the opposite direction when a price rises, ceteris paribus. A price
increase makes households worse off. If income and other prices do not change, spending the
same amount of money buys less and households will be forced to buy less. This is the income
effect. In addition, when the price of a product rises, that item becomes more expensive relative
to potential substitutes and the household is likely to substitute other goods for it. This is the
substitution effect.
What do the income and substitution effects tell us about the demand curve? Both the
income and the substitution effects imply a negative relationship between price and quantity
demanded—in other words, downward-sloping demand. When the price of something falls,
ceteris paribus, we are better off and we are likely to buy more of that good and other goods
(income effect). Because lower price also means “less expensive relative to substitutes,” we are
likely to buy more of the good (substitution effect). When the price of something rises, we are
-

worse off and we will buy less of it (income effect). Higher price also means “more expensive rela-
tive to substitutes,” and we are likely to buy less of it and more of other goods (substitution effect).5
Figure 6.5 summarizes the income and substitution effects of a price change of
gasoline prices.
If you recall the example of gasoline prices from early in the chapter, income and substitu-
tion effects help us answer the question posed. When gas prices rise, the income effects can cause
a fall in the demand for other goods. Since gas is a big part of many budgets, these income effects
can be very large. It is the income effect from gasoline price increases that some argue causes
consumers to switch away from high-priced brand name products.
Household Choice in Input Markets
So far, we have focused on the decision-making process that lies behind output demand curves.
Households with limited incomes allocate those incomes across various combinations of goods
and services that are available and affordable. In looking at the factors affecting choices in the
output market, we assumed that income was fixed, or given. We noted at the outset, however,
that income is in fact partially determined by choices that households make in input markets.
(Look back at Figure II.1 on p. 117.) We now turn to a brief discussion of the two decisions that
households make in input markets: the labor supply decision and the saving decision.
The Labor Supply Decision
Most income in the United States is wage and salary income paid as compensation for labor.
Household members supply labor in exchange for wages or salaries. As in output markets, house-
holds face constrained choices in input markets. They must decide
1. Whether to work
2. How much to work
3. What kind of a job to work at

of a Price Change
For normal goods, the income
and substitution effects work in
the same direction. Higher prices
lead to a lower quantity
demanded, and lower prices lead
to a higher quantity demanded.
5 For some goods, the income and substitution effects work in opposite directions.When our income rises, we may buy less of some
goods. In Chapter 3, we called such goods inferior goods.When the price of an inferior good rises, it is, like any other good, more expen-
sive relative to substitutes and we are likely to replace it with lower-priced substitutes. However, when we are worse off, we increase our
demand for inferior goods. Thus, the income effect could lead us to buy more of the good, partially offsetting the substitution effect.
Even if a good is “very inferior,” demand curves will slope downward as long as the substitution effect is larger than the
income effect. It is possible, at least in theory, for the income effect to be larger. In such a case, a price increase would actually
lead to an increase in quantity demanded. This possibility was pointed out by Alfred Marshall in Principles of Economics.
Marshall attributes the notion of an upward-sloping demand curve to Sir Robert Giffen; for this reason, the notion is often
referred to as Giffen’s paradox. Fortunately or unfortunately, no one has ever demonstrated that a Giffen good has existed.

CHAPTER 6
Household Behavior and Consumer Choice 133
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Substitution and Market Baskets
In driving to work one day, one of the authors of this text heard the
following advertisement for a local grocery store, which we will call
Harry’s Food.
“Harry’s has the best prices in town, and we can prove it!
Yesterday we chose Mr. Smith out of our checkout line for a com-
parison test. Mr. Smith is an average consumer, much like you and
me. In doing his weekly grocery shopping yesterday at Harry’s, he
spent $125. We then sent Mr. Smith to the neighboring competitor
with instructions to buy the same market basket of food. When he
returned with his food, he saw that his grocery total was $134. You
too will see that Harry’s can save you money!”
Advertisements like this one are commonplace. As you evalu-
ate the claims in the ad, several things may come to mind.
Perhaps Mr. Smith is not representative of consumers or is not
much like you. That might make Harry’s a good deal for him but
not for you. (So your demand curve looks different from 
Mr. Smith’s demand curve.) Or perhaps yesterday was a sale day,
meaning yesterday was not typical of Harrys’ prices. But there is
something more fundamentally wrong with the claims in this ad
even if you are just like Mr. Smith and Harry’s offers the same
prices every day. The fundamental error in this ad is revealed by
the work you have done in this chapter.
When Mr. Smith shopped, he presumably looked at the prices
of the various food choices offered at the market and tried to do
the best he could for his family given those prices and his family’s
tastes. If we go back to the utility-maximizing rule that you
learned in this chapter, we see that Mr. Smith was comparing the
marginal utility of each product he consumes relative to its price
in 
deciding 
what
bundle to buy.
In
pragmatic terms, if
Mr. Smith likes apples
and pears about the
same, while he was
shopping in Harry’s,
he would have bought
the cheaper of the
two. When he was
sent to the neighbor-
ing store, however, he
was constrained to
buy the same goods
that he bought at
Harry’s. (So he was
forced to buy pears
even if
they were
more expensive just
to duplicate the bun-
dle.) When we artifi-
cially restrict Mr. Smith’s ability to substitute goods, we almost
inevitably give him a more expensive bundle. The real question is
this: Would Mr. Smith have been more happy or less happy with
his market basket after spending $125 at Harry’s or at its rival?
Without knowing more about the shape of Mr. Smith’s utility
curve and the prices he faces, we cannot answer that question. The
dollar comparison in the ad doesn’t tell the whole story!
In essence, household members must decide how much labor to supply. The choices they
make are affected by:
1. Availability of jobs
2. Market wage rates
3. Skills they possess
As with decisions in output markets, the labor supply decision involves a set of trade-offs.
There are basically two alternatives to working for a wage: (1) not working and (2) doing unpaid
work. If you do not work, you sacrifice income for the benefits of staying home and reading,
watching TV, swimming, or sleeping. Another option is to work, but not for a money wage. In
this case, you sacrifice money income for the benefits of growing your own food, raising your
children, or taking care of your house.
As with the trade-offs in output markets, your final choice depends on how you value the
alternatives available. If you work, you earn a wage that you can use to buy things. Thus, the
trade-off is between the value of the goods and services you can buy with the wages you earn ver-
sus the value of things you can produce at home—home-grown food, manageable children, clean
clothes, and so on—or the value you place on leisure. This choice is illustrated in Figure 6.6. In
general, the wage rate can be thought of as the price—or the opportunity cost—of the benefits of
either unpaid work or leisure. Just as you choose among different goods by comparing the mar-
ginal utility of each relative to its price, you also choose between leisure and other goods by com-
paring the marginal utility of leisure relative to its price (the wage rate) with the marginal utility
of other goods relative to their prices.

A curve
that shows the quantity of
labor supplied at different
wage rates. Its shape depends
on how households react to
changes in the wage rate.
The Price of Leisure
In our analysis in the early part of this chapter, households had to allocate a limited budget
across a set of goods and services. Now they must choose among goods, services, and leisure.
When we add leisure to the picture, we do so with one important distinction. Trading one
good for another involves buying less of one and more of another, so households simply reallo-
cate money from one good to the other.“Buying” more leisure, however, means reallocating time
between work and nonwork activities. For each hour of leisure that you decide to consume, you
give up one hour’s wages. Thus, the wage rate is the price of leisure.
Conditions in the labor market determine the budget constraints and final opportunity
sets that households face. The availability of jobs and these job wage rates determine the
final combinations of goods and services that a household can afford. The final choice
within these constraints depends on the unique tastes and preferences of each household.
Different people place more or less value on leisure—but everyone needs to put food on 
the table.
Income and Substitution Effects of a Wage Change
A labor supply curve shows the quantity of labor supplied at different wage rates. The shape of
the labor supply curve depends on how households react to changes in the wage rate.
Consider an increase in wages. First, an increase in wages makes households better off. If they
work the same number of hours—that is, if they supply the same amount of labor—they will
earn higher incomes and be able to buy more goods and services. They can also buy more leisure.
If leisure is a normal good—that is, a good for which demand increases as income increases—an
increase in income will lead to a higher demand for leisure and a lower labor supply. This is the
income effect of a wage increase.
However, there is also a potential substitution effect of a wage increase. A higher wage rate
means that leisure is more expensive. If you think of the wage rate as the price of leisure, each
individual hour of leisure consumed at a higher wage costs more in forgone wages. As a result, we
would expect households to substitute other goods for leisure. This means working more, or a
lower quantity demanded of leisure and a higher quantity supplied of labor.
Note that in the labor market, the income and substitution effects work in opposite
directions when leisure is a normal good. The income effect of a wage increase implies
buying more leisure and working less; the substitution effect implies buying less leisure 
and working more. Whether households will supply more labor overall or less labor overall
when wages rise depends on the relative strength of both the income and the substitu-
tion effects.

If the substitution effect is greater than the income effect, the wage increase will increase
labor supply. This suggests that the labor supply curve slopes upward, or has a positive slope, like
the one in Figure 6.7(a). If the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, however, a higher
wage will lead to added consumption of leisure and labor supply will decrease. This implies that
the labor supply curve “bends back,” as the one in Figure 6.7(b) does.

Labor Supply Curves
During the early years of the Industrial Revolution in late eighteenth-century Great
Britain, the textile industry operated under what was called the “putting-out” system. Spinning
and weaving were done in small cottages to supplement the family farm income—hence the
term cottage industry. During that period, wages and household incomes rose considerably.
Some economic historians claim that this higher income actually led many households to take
more leisure and work fewer hours; the empirical evidence suggests a backward-bending labor
supply curve.
Just as income and substitution effects helped us understand household choices in output
markets, they now help us understand household choices in input markets. The point here is
simple: When leisure is added to the choice set, the line between input and output market deci-
sions becomes blurred. In fact, households decide simultaneously how much of each good to
consume and how much leisure to consume.
Saving and Borrowing: Present versus Future
Consumption
We began this chapter by examining the way households allocate a fixed income over a large
number of goods and services. We then pointed out that, at least in part, choices made by house-
holds determine income levels. Within the constraints imposed by the market, households decide
whether to work and how much to work.
So far, however, we have talked about only the current period—the allocation of current
income among alternative uses and the work/leisure choice today. Households can also (1) use
present income to finance future spending—they can save—or (2) use future income to finance
present spending—they can borrow.
When a household decides to save, it is using current income to finance future consumption.
That future consumption may come in 3 years, when you use your savings to buy a car; in 10 years,
when you sell stock to put a deposit on a house; or in 45 years, when you retire and begin to receive
money from your pension plan. Most people cannot finance large purchases—a house or condo-
minium, for example—out of current income and savings. They almost always borrow money and
sign a mortgage. When a household borrows, it is in essence financing a current purchase with
future income. It pays back the loan out of future income.
Even in simple economies such as the two-person desert-island economy of Colleen and
Bill (see Chapter 2), people must make decisions about present versus future consumption.
Colleen and Bill could (1) produce goods for today’s consumption by hunting and gathering,
(2) consume leisure by sleeping on the beach, or (3) work on projects to enhance future con-
sumption opportunities. Building a house or a boat over a 5-year period is trading present
When the substitution effect
outweighs the income effect, the
labor supply curve slopes
upward (a). When the income
effect outweighs the substitution
effect, the result is a “backward-
bending” labor supply curve: The

consumption for future consumption. As with all of the other choices we have examined in this
chapter, the broad principle will be to look at marginal utilities and prices. How much do
Colleen and Bill value having something now versus waiting for the future? How much do they
gain by waiting?
When a household saves, it usually puts the money into something that will generate
income. There is no sense in putting money under your mattress when you can make it work in
so many ways: savings accounts, money market funds, stocks, corporate bonds, and so on—
many of which are virtually risk-free. When you put your money in any of these places, you are
actually lending it out and the borrower pays you a fee for its use. This fee usually takes the
form of interest. The interest paid is the possible benefit Colleen and Bill get from forgoing cur-
rent consumption.
Just as changes in wage rates affect household behavior in the labor market, changes in inter-
est rates affect household behavior in capital markets. Higher interest rates mean that borrowing
is more expensive—required monthly payments on a newly purchased house or car will be
higher. Higher interest rates also mean that saving will earn a higher return: $1,000 invested in a
5 percent savings account or bond yields $50 per year. If rates rise to 10 percent, the annual inter-
est will rise to $100.
What impact do interest rates have on saving behavior? As with the effect of wage changes on
labor supply, the effect of changes in interest rates on saving can best be understood in terms of
income and substitution effects. Suppose, for example, that I have been saving for a number of
years for retirement. Will an increase in interest rates lead to an increase or a decrease in my sav-
ing? The answer is not obvious. First, because each dollar saved will earn a higher rate of return,
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
What Happens When the Cost of Self-Discovery Falls?
College graduates in 2009 and 2010 entered a difficult job market,
with fewer opportunities than their counterparts a few years earlier.
As the article below suggests, many ended up taking unpaid intern-
ships. Why take an unpaid internship rather than continue to look
for paid work?
Many new graduates are quite uncertain about what career to
pursue. A first job provides more than a paycheck. It provides an
opportunity to learn more about what a career in a particular area
looks like and whether it appeals to you. First jobs, in other words,
provide a chance to learn about both the world and oneself. When
jobs are plentiful, pursuing an unpaid internship in an area you are
interested in has a big opportunity cost: the lost wages associated
with a full-time job in what might be a less attractive industry. In a
world of few paying jobs, the opportunity cost of following your
heart in career terms is much lower.

For-Profits Finding Flood of Candidates in 
Poor Job Market
The Boston Globe
Throughout her senior year at Boston College, Brynn
Merritt worked part time at Entercom Boston, which owns
four radio stations, including WEEI and WRKO. She
blogged, called businesses to solicit merchandise for
WEEI’s Web site, produced ad displays, and sent newslet-
ter e-mail blasts.
For all of this, she was paid nothing.
“I did the same amount of work as a lot of people getting
paid did,’’ says Merritt, 22, who graduated this spring. But she’s
not complaining; in fact, she feels lucky. “I learned a ton,’’ says
Merritt, who received a course credit for the internship. “I feel I
could go into the business right now.’’
Unpaid internships have long been offered by nonprofits,
but for-profit businesses are increasingly taking advantage of
the number of students who, in a tight job market, are willing to
forgo a paycheck for practical experience.

CHAPTER 6
Household Behavior and Consumer Choice 137
financial capital market
The complex set of institutions
in which suppliers of capital
(households that save) and the
demand for capital (firms
wanting to invest) interact.
6 Here in Chapter 6, we are looking at a country as if it were isolated from the rest of the world. Very often, however, capital
investment is financed by funds loaned or provided by foreign citizens or governments. For example, in recent years, a substan-
tial amount of foreign savings has found its way into the United States for the purchase of stocks, bonds, and other financial
instruments. In part, these flows finance capital investment. Also, the United States and other countries that contribute funds to
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have provided billions in outright grants and loans to help developing
countries produce capital. For more information on these institutions, see Chapter 21.
the “price” of spending today in terms of forgone future spending is higher. That is, each dollar
that I spend today (instead of saving) costs me more in terms of future consumption because my
saving will now earn a higher return. On this score, I will be led to save more, which is the substi-
tution effect at work.
However, higher interest rates mean more than that. Higher interest rates mean that it will
take less saving today to reach a specific target amount of savings tomorrow. I will not need to
save as much for retirement or future consumption as I did before. One hundred dollars put into
a savings account with 5 percent compound interest will double in 14 years. If interest was paid at
a rate of 10 percent, I would have my $200 in just 7 years. Consequently, I may be led to save less,
which is the income effect at work. Higher interest rates mean savers are better off; so higher
interest rates may lead to less saving. The final impact of a change in interest rates on saving
depends on the relative size of the income and substitution effects. Most empirical evidence indi-
cates that saving tends to increase as the interest rate rises. In other words, the substitution effect
is larger than the income effect.
Saving and investment decisions involve a huge and complex set of institutions, the financial
capital market, in which the suppliers of capital (households that save) and the demand for cap-
ital (firms that want to invest) interact. The amount of capital investment in an economy is con-
strained in the long run by that economy’s saving rate. You can think of household saving as the
economy’s supply of capital. When a firm borrows to finance a capital acquisition, it is almost as
if households have supplied the capital in exchange for the fee we call interest. We treat capital
markets in detail in Chapter 11.6
A Review: Households in Output and Input
Markets
In probing the behavior of households in both input and output markets and examining the
nature of constrained choice, we went behind the household demand curve using the simplifying
assumption that income was fixed and given. Income, wealth, and prices set the limits, or
constraints, within which households make their choices in output markets. Within those limits,
households make their choices on the basis of personal tastes and preferences.
The notion of utility helps explain the process of choice. The law of diminishing marginal
utility partly explains why people seem to spread their incomes over many different goods and
services and why demand curves have a negative slope. Another important explanation behind
the negative relationship between price and quantity demanded lies in income effects and
substitution effects.
As we turned to input markets, we relaxed the assumption that income was fixed and given.
In the labor market, households are forced to weigh the value of leisure against the value of goods
and services that can be bought with wage income. Once again, we found household preferences
for goods and leisure operating within a set of constraints imposed by the market. Households
also face the problem of allocating income and consumption over more than one period of time.
They can finance spending in the future with today’s income by saving and earning interest, or
they can spend tomorrow’s income today by borrowing.
We now have a rough sketch of the factors that determine output demand and input supply.
(You can review these in Figure II.1 on p. 117.) In the next three chapters, we turn to firm behav-
ior and explore in detail the factors that affect output supply and input demand.

HOUSEHOLD CHOICE IN OUTPUT MARKETS p. 121
1. Every household must make three basic decisions: (1) how
much of each product, or output, to demand; (2) how much
labor to supply; and (3) how much to spend today and how
much to save for the future.
2. Income, wealth, and prices define household budget constraint.
The budget constraint separates those combinations of goods
and services that are available from those that are not. All the
points below and to the left of a graph of a household budget
constraint make up the choice set, or opportunity set.
3. It is best to think of the household choice problem as one of
allocating income over a large number of goods and services.
A change in the price of one good may change the entire
allocation. Demand for some goods may rise, while demand
for others may fall.
4. As long as a household faces a limited income, the real cost
of any single good or service is the value of the next pre-
ferred other goods and services that could have been pur-
chased with the same amount of money.
5. Within the constraints of prices, income, and wealth,
household decisions ultimately depend on preferences—
likes, dislikes, and tastes.
THE BASIS OF CHOICE: UTILITY p. 126
6. Whether one item is preferable to another depends on how
much utility, or satisfaction, it yields relative to its alternatives.
7. The law of diminishing marginal utility says that the more of
any good we consume in a given period of time, the less sat-
isfaction, or utility, we get out of each additional (or mar-
ginal) unit of that good.
8. Households allocate income among goods and services to
maximize utility. This implies choosing activities that yield
the highest marginal utility per dollar. In a two-good world,
households will choose to equate the marginal utility per
dollar spent on X with the marginal utility per dollar spent
on Y. This is the utility-maximizing rule.
INCOME AND SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS p. 130
9. The fact that demand curves have a negative slope can be
explained in two ways: (1) Marginal utility for all goods
diminishes. (2) For most normal goods, both the income and
the substitution effects of a price decline lead to more con-
sumption of the good.
HOUSEHOLD CHOICE IN INPUT MARKETS p. 132
10. In the labor market, a trade-off exists between the value of
the goods and services that can be bought in the market or
produced at home and the value that one places on leisure.
The opportunity cost of paid work is leisure and unpaid
work. The wage rate is the price, or opportunity cost, of the
benefits of unpaid work or leisure.
11. The income and substitution effects of a change in the wage
rate work in opposite directions. Higher wages mean that
(1) leisure is more expensive (likely response: people work
more—substitution effect) and (2) more income is earned
in a given number of hours, so some time may be spent on
leisure (likely response: people work less—income effect).
12. In addition to deciding how to allocate its present income
among goods and services, a household may also decide to
save or borrow. When a household decides to save part of its
current income, it is using current income to finance future
spending. When a household borrows, it finances current
purchases with future income.
13. An increase in interest rates has a positive effect on saving if
the substitution effect dominates the income effect and a
negative effect if the income effect dominates the substitu-
tion effect. Most empirical evidence shows that the substitu-
tion effect dominates here.

P R O B L E M S
1. For each of the following events, consider how you might react.
What things might you consume more or less of? Would you
work more or less? Would you increase or decrease your saving?
Are your responses consistent with the discussion of household
behavior in this chapter?
a. You have a very close friend who lives in another city, a 
3-hour bus ride away. The price of a round-trip ticket rises
from $20 to $45.
b. Tuition at your college is cut 25 percent.
c. You receive an award that pays you $300 per month for the
next 5 years.
d. Interest rates rise dramatically, and savings accounts are now
paying 10% interest annually.
e. The price of food doubles. (If you are on a meal plan,
assume that your board charges double.)
f. A new business opens up nearby offering part-time jobs at
$20 per hour.

2. The following table gives a hypothetical total utility schedule for
the Cookie Monster (CM):
CHAPTER 6
Household Behavior and Consumer Choice 139
Calculate the CM’s marginal utility schedule. Draw a graph of
total and marginal utility. If cookies cost the CM 5 cents each
and CM had a good income, what is the maximum number of
cookies he would most likely eat in a day?
3. Kamika lives in Chicago but goes to school in Tucson, Arizona.
For the last 2 years, she has made four trips home each year.
During 2010, the price of a round-trip ticket from Chicago to
Tucson increased from $350 to $600. As a result, Kamika
decided not to buy a new outfit that year and decided not to
drive to Phoenix with friends for an expensive rock concert.
a. Explain how Kamika’s demand for clothing and concert tick-
ets can be affected by an increase in air travel prices.
b. By using this example, explain why both income and substi-
tution effects might be expected to reduce Kamika’s number
of trips home.
4. Sketch the following budget constraints:
effects were stronger than substitution effects. Do you agree or
disagree? Explain your answer.
7. Assume that Mei has $100 per month to divide between dinners
at a Chinese restaurant and evenings at Zanzibar, a local pub.
Assume that going to Zanzibar costs $20 and eating at the
Chinese restaurant costs $10. Suppose Mei spends two evenings
at Zanzibar and eats six times at the Chinese restaurant.
a. Draw Mei’s budget constraint and show that she can afford
six dinners and two evenings at Zanzibar.
b. Assume that Mei comes into some money and can now
spend $200 per month. Draw her new budget constraint.
c. As a result of the increase in income, Mei decides to spend
eight evenings at Zanzibar and eat at the Chinese restaurant
four times. What kind of a good is Chinese food? What kind
of a good is a night at Zanzibar?
d. What part of the increase in Zanzibar trips is due to the
income effect, and what part is due to the substitution effect?
Explain your answer.
8. Decide whether you agree or disagree with each of the following
statements and explain your reason:
a. If the income effect of a wage change dominates the substitu-
tion effect for a given household and the household works
longer hours following a wage change, wages must have risen.
b. In product markets, when a price falls, the substitution effect
leads to more consumption; but for normal goods, the
income effect leads to less consumption.
9. Suppose the price of X is $5 and the price of Y is $10 and a hypo-
thetical household has $500 to spend per month on goods X and Y.
a. Sketch the household budget constraint.
b. Assume that the household splits its income equally between
X and Y. Show where the household ends up on the budget
constraint.
c. Suppose the household income doubles to $1,000. Sketch the
new budget constraint facing the household.
d. Suppose after the change the household spends $200 on Y
and $800 on X. Does this imply that X is a normal or an infe-
rior good? What about Y?
10. For this problem, assume that Joe has $80 to spend on books
and movies each month and that both goods must be purchased
whole (no fractional units). Movies cost $8 each, and books cost
$20 each. Joe’s preferences for movies and books are summa-
rized by the following information:
a. Fill in the figures for marginal utility and marginal utility per
dollar for both movies and books.
b. Are these preferences consistent with the law of diminishing
marginal utility? Explain briefly.
c. Given the budget of $80, what quantity of books and what
quantity of movies will maximize Joe’s level of satisfaction?
Explain briefly.
5. On January 1, Professor Smith made a resolution to lose some
weight and save some money. He decided that he would strictly
budget $100 for lunches each month. For lunch, he has only two
choices: the faculty club, where the price of a lunch is $5, and
Alice’s Restaurant, where the price of a lunch is $10. Every day
that he does not eat lunch, he runs 5 miles.
a. Assuming that Professor Smith spends the $100 each month
at either Alice’s or the club, sketch his budget constraint.
Show actual numbers on the axes.
b. Last month Professor Smith chose to eat at the club 10 times
and at Alice’s 5 times. Does this choice fit within his budget
constraint? Explain your answer.
c. Last month Alice ran a half-price lunch special all month. All
lunches were reduced to $5. Show the effect on Professor
Smith’s budget constraint.
6. During 2010, Congress debated the advisability of retaining
some or all of the tax cuts signed into law by former President
George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 and set to expire at the end of
2010. By reducing tax rates across the board, take-home pay for
all taxpaying workers would increase. The purpose, in part, was
to encourage work and increase the supply of labor. Households
would respond the way the president hoped, but only if income

11. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 133] John’s 
New York–based firm has sent him to work in its Paris office.
Recognizing that the cost of living differs between Paris and
New York, the company wants to adjust John’s salary so that
John is as well off (or happy) in Paris as he was in New York.
John suggests that he submit a list of the things he bought 
in New York in a typical month. The firm can use the list 
to determine John’s salary by figuring out how much the
same items cost in Paris. Is this a good idea? Explain 
your answer.

13. Thomas has allocated $48 per month for entertainment
expenses, which he uses either to go bowling or to play
billiards. One night of bowling costs Thomas $8, and one
night of billiards costs Thomas $4. Use the information in the
following graphs to determine how many nights Thomas
should spend bowling and how many nights he should play
billiards in order to maximize his utility. Explain your answer.
17. The table shows Regina’s marginal utility numbers for ham-
burgers and pizzas. Regina is trying to decide which item to

CHAPTER 6 APPENDIX
Indifference Curves
Early in this chapter, we saw how a consumer choosing
between two goods is constrained by the prices of those goods
and by his or her income. This Appendix returns to that exam-
ple and analyzes the process of choice more formally. (Before
we proceed, carefully review the text under the heading “The
Budget Constraint More Formally,” p. 123)
Assumptions
We base the following analysis on four assumptions:
1. We assume that this analysis is restricted to goods that
yield positive marginal utility, or, more simply, that “more
is better.” One way to justify this assumption is to say that
when more of something makes you worse off, you can
simply throw it away at no cost. This is the assumption of
free disposal.
2. The marginal rate of substitution is defined as MUX/MUY,
or the ratio at which a household is willing to substitute X
for Y. When MUX/MUY is equal to 4, for example, I would
be willing to trade 4 units of Y for 1 additional unit of X.
We assume a diminishing marginal rate of substitution.
That is, as more of X and less of Y are consumed, MUX/MUY
declines.As you consume more of X and less of Y, X
becomes less valuable in terms of units of Y, or Y becomes
more valuable in terms of X. This is almost but not precisely
equivalent to assuming diminishing marginal utility.
3. We assume that consumers have the ability to choose
among the combinations of goods and services available.
Confronted with the choice between two alternative com-
binations of goods and services, A and B, a consumer
responds in one of three ways: (1) She prefers A over B,
(2) she prefers B over A, or (3) she is indifferent between
A and B—that is, she likes A and B equally.
4. We assume that consumer choices are consistent with a
simple assumption of rationality. If a consumer shows
that he prefers A to B and subsequently shows that he
prefers B to a third alternative, C, he should prefer A to C
when confronted with a choice between the two.
Deriving Indifference Curves
If we accept these four assumptions, we can construct a “map”
of a consumer’s preferences. These preference maps are made
up of indifference curves. An indifference curve is a set of
points, each point representing a combination of goods X and
Y, all of which yield the same total utility.

142
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
Figure 6A.1 shows how we might go about deriving an
indifference curve for a hypothetical consumer. Each point in
the diagram represents some amount of X and some amount of Y.
Point A in the diagram, for example, represents XA units of X and
YA units of Y. Now suppose we take some amount of Y away
from our hypothetical consumer, moving him or her to A'. At A',
the consumer has the same amount of X—that is, XA units—but
less Y and now has only YC units of Y.Because “more is better,”our
consumer is unequivocally worse off at A' than at A.
To compensate for the loss of Y, we begin giving our con-
sumer some more X. If we give the individual just a little, he or
she will still be worse off than at A. If we give this individual a
great deal of X, he or she will be better off. There must be some
quantity of X that will just compensate for the loss of Y. By giv-
ing the consumer that amount, we will have put together a
bundle, YC and XC, that yields the same total utility as bundle
A. This is bundle C in Figure 6A.1. If confronted with a choice
between bundles A and C, our consumer will say,“Either one; I
do not care.” In other words, the consumer is indifferent
between A and C. When confronted with a choice between
bundles C and B (which represent XB and YB units of X and Y),
this person is also indifferent. The points along the curve
labeled i in Figure 6A.1 represent all the combinations of X and
Y that yield the same total utility to our consumer. That curve
is thus an indifference curve.
Each consumer has a whole set of indifference curves.
Return for a moment to Figure 6A.1. Starting at point A again,
imagine that we give the consumer a tiny bit more X and a tiny
bit more Y. Because more is better, we know that the new bun-
dle will yield a higher level of total utility and the consumer
will be better off. Now just as we constructed the first indiffer-
ence curve, we can construct a second one. What we get is an
indifference curve that is higher and to the right of the first
curve. Because utility along an indifference curve is constant at
all points, every point along the new curve represents a higher
level of total utility than every point along the first.
Figure 6A.2 shows a set of four indifference curves. The
curve labeled i4 represents the combinations of X and Y that

 FIGURE 6A.1 An Indifference Curve
An indifference curve is a set of points, each representing a combina-
tion of some amount of good X and some amount of good Y, that all
yield the same amount of total utility. The consumer depicted here is
indifferent between bundles A and B, B and C, and A and C.
yield the highest level of total utility among the four. Many
other indifference curves exist between those shown on the
diagram; in fact, their number is infinite. Notice that as you
move up and to the right, utility increases.
The shapes of the indifference curves depend on the pref-
erences of the consumer, and the whole set of indifference
curves is called a preference map. Each consumer has a
unique preference map.
Properties of Indifference Curves
The indifference curves shown in Figure 6A.2 are drawn bow-
ing in toward the origin, or zero point, on the axes. In other
words, the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curves
decreases, or the curves get flatter, as we move to the right.
Thus, we say that indifference curves are convex toward the
origin. This shape follows directly from the assumption of
diminishing marginal rate of substitution and makes sense if
you remember the law of diminishing marginal utility.
To understand the convex shape, compare the segment of
curve i1 between A and B with the segment of the same curve
between C and D. Moving from A to B, the consumer is willing
to give up a substantial amount of Y to get a small amount of
X. (Remember that total utility is constant along an indiffer-
ence curve; the consumer is therefore indifferent between A
and B.) Moving from C and D, however, the consumer is will-
ing to give up only a small amount of Y to get more X.
This changing trade-off makes complete sense when you
remember the law of diminishing marginal utility. Notice that
between A and B, a great deal of Y is consumed and the marginal
utility derived from a unit of Y is likely to be small. At the same
time,though,only a little of X is being consumed; so the marginal
utility derived from consuming a unit of X is likely to be high.
Suppose, for example, that X is pizza and Y is soda. Near A
and B, a thirsty, hungry football player who has 10 sodas in
front of him but only one slice of pizza will trade several sodas

CHAPTER 6    Household Behavior and Consumer Choice 143
for another slice. Down around C and D, however, he has
20 slices of pizza and a single soda. Now he will trade several
slices of pizza to get an additional soda.
We can show how the trade-off changes more formally by
deriving an expression for the slope of an indifference curve.
Let us look at the arc (that is, the section of the curve) between
A and B. We know that in moving from A to B, total utility
remains constant. That means that the utility lost as a result of
consuming less Y must be matched by the utility gained from
consuming more X. We can approximate the loss of utility by
multiplying the marginal utility of Y (MUY) by the number of
units by which consumption of Y is curtailed (Y). Similarly,
we can approximate the utility gained from consuming more X
by multiplying the marginal utility of X (MUX) by the number
of additional units of X consumed (X). Remember: Because
the consumer is indifferent between points A and B, total util-
ity is the same at both points. Thus, these two must be equal in
magnitude—that is, the gain in utility from consuming more X
must equal the loss in utility from consuming less Y. Because
Y is a negative number (because consumption of Y decreases
from A to B), it follows that
When we divide both sides by MUY and by X, we obtain
Recall that the slope of any line is calculated by dividing the
change in Y—that is, Y—by the change in X—that is, X.
Thus, the slope of an indifference curve is the ratio of the mar-
ginal utility of X to the marginal utility of Y, and it is negative.
Now let us return to our pizza (X) and soda (Y) example.
As we move down from the A:B area to the C:D area, our foot-
ball player is consuming less soda and more pizza. The marginal
utility of pizza (MUX) is falling, and the marginal utility of soda
(MUY) is rising. That means that MUX/MUY (the marginal rate
of substitution) is falling and the absolute value of the slope of
the indifference curve is declining. Indeed, it does get flatter.
Consumer Choice
As you recall, demand depends on income, the prices of goods
and services, and preferences or tastes. We are now ready to see
how preferences as embodied in indifference curves interact
with budget constraints to determine how the final quantities
of X and Y will be chosen.
In Figure 6A.3, a set of indifference curves is superim-
posed on a consumer’s budget constraint. Recall that the bud-
get constraint separates those combinations of X and Y that are
available from those that are not. The constraint simply shows
those combinations that can be purchased with an income of I
at prices PX and PY. The budget constraint crosses the X-axis at
I/PX, or the number of units of X that can be purchased with I
if nothing is spent on Y. Similarly, the budget constraint
crosses the Y-axis at I/PY, or the number of units of Y that can
be purchased with an income of I if nothing is spent on X. The

Equilibrium
Consumers will choose the combination of X and Y that maximizes
total utility. Graphically, the consumer will move along the budget
constraint until the highest possible indifference curve is reached. At
that point, the budget constraint and the indifference curve are
tangent. This point of tangency occurs at X* and Y* (point B).
shaded area is the consumer’s opportunity set. The slope of a
budget constraint is –PX/PY.
Consumers will choose from among available combina-
tions of X and Y the one that maximizes utility. In graphic terms,
a consumer will move along the budget constraint until he or
she is on the highest possible indifference curve. Utility rises by
moving from points such as A or C (which lie on i1) toward B
(which lies on i2). Any movement away from point B moves the
consumer to a lower indifference curve—a lower level of utility.
In this case, utility is maximized when our consumer buys X*
units of X and Y* units of Y. At point B, the budget constraint is
just tangent to—that is, just touches—indifference curve i2. As
long as indifference curves are convex to the origin, utility
maximization will take place at that point at which the indif-
ference curve is just tangent to the budget constraint.
The tangency condition has important implications.
Where two curves are tangent, they have the same slope, which
implies that the slope of the indifference curve is equal to the
slope of the budget constraint at the point of tangency:
By multiplying both sides of this equation by MUY and divid-
ing both sides by PX,we can rewrite this utility-maximizing rule as
This is the same rule derived in our earlier discussion without
using indifference curves.We can describe this rule intuitively by

saying that consumers maximize their total utility by equating
the marginal utility per dollar spent on X with the marginal util-
ity per dollar spent on Y. If this rule did not hold, utility could be
increased by shifting money from one good to the other.
Deriving a Demand Curve from
Indifference Curves and Budget Constraints
We now turn to the task of deriving a simple demand curve
from indifference curves and budget constraints. A demand
curve shows the quantity of a single good, X in this case, that a
consumer will demand at various prices. To derive the demand
curve, we need to confront our consumer with several alterna-
tive prices for X while keeping other prices, income, and pref-
erences constant.
Figure 6A.4 shows the derivation. We begin with price 
.
At that price, the utility-maximizing point is A, where the
P1
X
consumer demands X1 units of X. Therefore, in the right-hand
diagram, we plot 
against X1. This is the first point on our
demand curve.
Now we lower the price of X to 
Lowering the price
expands the opportunity set, and the budget constraint
swivels to the right. Because the price of X has fallen, when
our consumer spends all of the income on X, he or she can
buy more of it. Our consumer is also better off because of
being able to move to a higher indifference curve. The new
utility-maximizing point is B, where the consumer demands
X2 units of X. Because the consumer demands X2 units of X at
a price of
we plot 
against X2 in the right-hand diagram.
A second price cut to 
moves our consumer to point C, with
a demand of X3 units of X, and so on. Thus, we see how the
demand curve can be derived from a consumer’s preference
map and budget constraint.

The Production
Process: The Behavior
of Profit-Maximizing
Firms
In Chapter 6, we took a brief look
at the household decisions that lie
behind supply and demand curves.
We spent some time discussing
household choices: how much to
work and how to choose among
the wide range of goods and ser-
vices available within the con-
straints of prices and income. We
also identified some of the influ-
ences on household demand in
output markets, as well as some of
the influences on household sup-
ply behavior in input markets.
We now turn to the other side of the system and examine the behavior of firms. Firms pur-
chase inputs to produce and sell outputs that range from computers to string quartet perfor-
mances. In other words, they demand factors of production in input markets and supply goods
and services in output markets. In this chapter, we look inside the firm at the production process
that transforms inputs into outputs. Although Chapters 7 through 12 describe the behavior of
perfectly competitive firms, much of what we say in these chapters also applies to firms that are
not perfectly competitive. For example, when we turn to monopoly in Chapter 13, we will be
describing firms that are similar to competitive firms in many ways. All firms, whether competi-
tive or not, demand inputs, engage in production, and produce outputs. All firms have an incen-
tive to maximize profits and thus to minimize costs.
Central to our analysis is production, the process by which inputs are combined, trans-
formed, and turned into outputs. Firms vary in size and internal organization, but they all take
inputs and transform them into goods and services for which there is some demand. For exam-
ple, an independent accountant combines labor, paper, telephone and e-mail service, time, learn-
ing, and a Web site to provide help to confused taxpayers. An automobile plant uses steel, labor,
plastic, electricity, machines, and countless other inputs to produce cars. If we want to under-
stand a firm’s costs, we first need to understand how it efficiently combines inputs to produce
goods and services. Before we begin our discussion of the production process, however, we need
to clarify some of the assumptions on which our analysis is based.
Although our discussions in the next several chapters focus on profit-making business
firms, it is important to understand that production and productive activity are not confined to
private business firms. Households also engage in transforming factors of production (labor,
capital, energy, natural resources, and so on) into useful things. When you work in your garden,
you are combining land, labor, fertilizer, seeds, and tools (capital) into the vegetables you eat
and the flowers you enjoy. The government also combines land, labor, and capital to produce
public services for which demand exists: national defense, homeland security, police and fire
protection, and education, to name a few.

 FIGURE 7.1 The Three
Decisions That All Firms
Must Make
The first and last choices are linked by the second choice. Once a firm has decided how much
to produce, the choice of a production method determines the firm’s input requirements. If a
sweater company decides to produce 5,000 sweaters this month, it knows how many production
workers it will need, how much electricity it will use, how much raw yarn to purchase, and how
many sewing machines to run.
Similarly, given a technique of production, any set of input quantities determines the
amount of output that can be produced. Certainly, the number of machines and workers
employed in a sweater mill determines how many sweaters can be produced.
Changing the technology of production will change the relationship between input and out-
put quantities. An apple orchard that uses expensive equipment to raise pickers up into the trees
will harvest more fruit with fewer workers in a given period of time than an orchard in which
pickers use simple ladders. It is also possible that two different technologies can produce the same
quantity of output. For example, a fully computerized textile mill with only a few workers run-
ning the machines may produce the same number of sweaters as a mill with no sophisticated
machines but many workers. A profit-maximizing firm chooses the technology that minimizes its
costs for a given level of output.
In this chapter, all firms in a given industry produce the same exact product and we are con-
cerned solely with production. In later chapters, these three basic decisions will be expanded to
include the setting of prices and the determination of product quality.
Profits and Economic Costs
We assume that firms are in business to make a profit and that a firm’s behavior is guided by the goal
of maximizing profits. What is profit? Profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost:
profit = total revenue - total cost
Total revenue is the amount received from the sale of the product; it is equal to the number of
units sold (q) times the price received per unit (P). Total cost is less straightforward to define.We
define total cost here to include (1) out-of-pocket costs and (2) opportunity cost of all inputs or
factors of production. Out-of-pocket costs are sometimes referred to as explicit costs or
accounting costs. These refer to costs as an accountant would calculate them. Economic costs
include the opportunity cost of every input. These opportunity costs are often referred to as
implicit costs. The term profit will from here on refer to economic profit. So whenever we say profit
= total revenue - total cost, what we really mean is
economic  profit = total revenue - total economic cost
Private business firms are set apart from other producers, such as households and govern-
ment, by their purpose. A firm exists when a person or a group of people decides to produce a
good or service to meet a perceived demand. Firms engage in production—that is, they trans-
form inputs into outputs—because they can sell their products for more than it costs to pro-
duce them.
The Behavior of Profit-Maximizing Firms
All firms must make several basic decisions to achieve what we assume to be their primary objective—
maximum profits.
As Figure 7.1 states, the three decisions that all firms must make include:
1. How much output to supply (quantity of product)
2. How to produce that output (which production technique/technology to use)
3. How much of each input to demand

CHAPTER 7
The Production Process: The Behavior of Profit-Maximizing Firms 149
The reason we take opportunity costs into account is that we are interested in analyzing the
behavior of firms from the standpoint of a potential investor or a potential new competitor. If I
am thinking about buying a firm or shares in a firm or entering an industry as a new firm, I need
to consider the full costs of production. For example, if a family business employs three family
members but pays them no wage, there is still a cost: the opportunity cost of their labor. In eval-
uating the business from the outside, these costs must be added if we want to figure out whether
the business is successful.
The most important opportunity cost that is included in economic cost is the opportunity
cost of capital. The way we treat the opportunity cost of capital is to add a normal rate of return to
capital as part of economic cost.
Normal Rate of Return
When someone decides to start a firm, that person must com-
mit resources. To operate a manufacturing firm, you need a plant and some equipment. To
start a restaurant, you need to buy grills, ovens, tables, chairs, and so on. In other words, you
must invest in capital. To start an e-business, you need a host site, some computer equipment,
some software, and a Web-site design. Such investment requires resources that stay tied up in
the firm as long as it operates. Even firms that have been around a long time must continue to
invest. Plant and equipment wear out and must be replaced. Firms that decide to expand must
put new capital in place. This is as true of proprietorships, where the resources come directly
from the proprietor, as it is of corporations, where the resources needed to make investments
come from shareholders.
Whenever resources are used to invest in a business, there is an opportunity cost. Instead of
opening a candy store, you could put your funds into an alternative use such as a certificate of
deposit or a government bond, both of which earn interest. Instead of using its retained earnings
to build a new plant, a firm could earn interest on those funds or pay them out to shareholders.
Rate of return is the annual flow of net income generated by an investment expressed as a
percentage of the total investment. For example, if someone makes a $100,000 investment in cap-
ital to start a small restaurant and the restaurant produces a flow of profit of $15,000 every year,
we say the project has a “rate of return” of 15 percent. Sometimes we refer to the rate of return as
the yield of the investment.
A normal rate of return is the rate that is just sufficient to keep owners and investors satis-
fied. If the rate of return were to fall below normal, it would be difficult or impossible for managers
to raise resources needed to purchase new capital. Owners of the firm would be receiving a rate of
return that was lower than what they could receive elsewhere in the economy, and they would have
no incentive to invest in the firm.
If the firm has fairly steady revenues and the future looks secure, the normal rate of
return should be very close to the interest rate on risk-free government bonds. A firm cer-
tainly will not keep investors interested in it if it does not pay them a rate of return at least as
high as they can get from a risk-free government or corporate bond. If a firm is rock solid
and the economy is steady, it may not have to pay a much higher rate. However, if a firm is in
a very speculative industry and the future of the economy is shaky, it may have to pay sub-
stantially more to keep its shareholders happy. In exchange for a risk that the business may fal-
ter or even fail, the shareholders will expect a higher return.
A normal rate of return is considered a part of the total cost of a business. Adding a normal
rate of return to total cost has an important implication: When a firm earns a normal rate of
return, it is earning a zero profit as we have defined profit. If the level of profit is positive, the firm
is earning an above-normal rate of return on capital.
A simple example will illustrate the concepts of a normal rate of return being part of total
cost. Suppose that Sue and Ann decide to start a small business selling turquoise belts in the
Denver airport. To get into the business, they need to invest in a fancy pushcart. The price of the
pushcart is $20,000 with all the displays and attachments included. Suppose that Sue and Ann
estimate that they will sell 3,000 belts each year for $10 each. Further assume that each belt costs
$5 from the supplier. Finally, the cart must be staffed by one clerk, who works for an annual wage
of $14,000. Is this business going to make a profit?
To answer this question, we must determine total revenue and total cost. First, annual rev-
enue is $30,000 (3,000 belts  $10). Total cost includes the cost of the belts—$15,000 (3,000 belts
 $5)—plus the labor cost of $14,000, for a total of $29,000. Thus, on the basis of the annual rev-
enue and cost flows, the firm seems to be making a profit of $1,000 ($30,000 - $29,000).
normal rate of return
A rate
of return on capital that is just
sufficient to keep owners and
investors satisfied. For
relatively risk-free firms, it
should be nearly the same as
the interest rate on risk-free
government bonds.

150
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
What about the $20,000 initial investment in the pushcart? This investment is not a direct
part of the cost of Sue and Ann’s firm. If we assume that the cart maintains its value over time, the
only thing that Sue and Ann are giving up is the interest they might have earned had they not tied up
their funds in the pushcart. That is, the only real cost is the opportunity cost of the investment,
which is the forgone interest on the $20,000.
Now suppose that Sue and Ann want a minimum return equal to 10 percent—which is, say,
the rate of interest that they could have gotten by purchasing corporate bonds. This implies a nor-
mal return of 10 percent, or $2,000 annually (= $20,000  0.10) on the $20,000 investment. As we
determined earlier, Sue and Ann will earn only $1,000 annually. This is only a 5 percent return on
their investment. Thus, they are really earning a below-normal return. Recall that the opportunity
cost of capital must be added to total cost in calculating profit. Thus, the total cost in this case is
$31,000 ($29,000 + $2,000 in forgone interest on the investment). The level of profit is negative:
$30,000 minus $31,000 equals –$1,000. These calculations are summarized in Table 7.1. Because
the level of profit is negative, Sue and Ann are actually suffering a loss on their belt business.
When a firm earns a positive level of profit, it is earning more than is sufficient to retain the
interest of investors. In fact, positive profits are likely to attract new firms into an industry and
cause existing firms to expand.
When a firm suffers a negative level of profit—that is, when it incurs a loss—it is earning at a
rate below that required to keep investors happy. Such a loss may or may not be a loss as an
accountant would measure it. Even if a firm is earning a rate of return of 10 percent, it is earning
a below-normal rate of return, or a loss, if a normal return for its industry is 15 percent. Losses
may cause some firms to exit the industry; others will contract in size. Certainly, new investment
will not flow into such an industry.
Short-Run versus Long-Run Decisions
The decisions made by a firm—how much to produce, how to produce it, and what inputs to
demand—all take time into account. If a firm decides that it wants to double or triple its output,
it may need time to arrange financing, hire architects and contractors, and build a new plant.
Planning for a major expansion can take years. In the meantime, the firm must decide how much
to produce within the constraint of its existing plant. If a firm decides to get out of a particular
business, it may take time to arrange an orderly exit. There may be contract obligations to fulfill,
equipment to sell, and so on. Once again, the firm must decide what to do in the meantime.
A firm’s immediate response to a change in the economic environment may differ from its
response over time. Consider, for example, a small restaurant with 20 tables that becomes very
popular. The immediate problem for the owners is getting the most profit within the constraint
of the existing restaurant. The owner might consider adding a few tables or speeding up service
to squeeze in a few more customers. Some popular restaurants do not take reservations, forcing
people to wait at the bar. This practice increases drink revenues and keeps tables full at all times.
At the same time, the owner may be thinking of expanding the current facility, moving to a larger
facility, or opening a second restaurant. In the future, the owner might buy the store next door
and double the capacity. Such decisions might require negotiating a lease, buying new equip-
ment, and hiring more staff. It takes time to make and implement these decisions.

CHAPTER 7
The Production Process: The Behavior of Profit-Maximizing Firms 151
Because the character of immediate response differs from long-run adjustment, it is useful to
define two time periods: the short run and the long run. Two assumptions define the short run:
(1) a fixed scale (or a fixed factor of production) and (2) no entry into or exit from the industry.
First, the short run is defined as that period during which existing firms have some fixed factor of
production—that is, during which time some factor locks them into their current scale of opera-
tions. Second, new firms cannot enter and existing firms cannot exit an industry in the short run.
Firms may curtail operations, but they are still locked into some costs even though they may be in
the process of going out of business.
Which factor or factors of production are fixed in the short run differs from industry to
industry. For a manufacturing firm, the size of the physical plant is often the greatest limitation.
A factory is built with a given production rate in mind. Although that rate can be increased, out-
put cannot increase beyond a certain limit in the short run. For a private physician, the limit may
be the capacity to see patients; the day has only so many hours. In the long run, the doctor may
invite others to join the practice and expand; but for now, in the short run, this sole physician is
the firm, with a capacity that is the firm’s only capacity. For a farmer, the fixed factor may be
land. The capacity of a small farm is limited by the number of acres being cultivated.
In the long run, there are no fixed factors of production. Firms can plan for any output level
they find desirable. They can double or triple output, for example. In addition, new firms can start
up operations (enter the industry) and existing firms can go out of business (exit the industry).
No hard-and-fast rule specifies how long the short run is. The point is that firms make two
basic kinds of decisions: those that govern the day-to-day operations of the firm and those that
involve longer-term strategic planning. Sometimes major decisions can be implemented in
weeks. Often, however, the process takes years. In many large firms, different people often make
the short- and long-run decisions. A production manager might well be charged with trying to
do the best she can with the plant and equipment that she has, while her boss, the division head,
figures out whether expansion of the plant is a good idea. In a single proprietorship, one person
may wear both hats, thinking simultaneously about how to make the most out of the present
while taking steps to improve the future of the business.
The Bases of Decisions: Market Price of Outputs, Available
Technology, and Input Prices
As we said earlier, a firm’s three fundamental decisions are made with the objective of maximiz-
ing profits. Because profits equal total revenues minus total costs, each firm needs to know how
much it costs to produce its product and how much its product can be sold for.
To know how much it costs to produce a good or service, a firm needs to know something
about the production techniques that are available and about the prices of the inputs
required. To estimate how much it will cost to operate a gas station, for instance, a firm needs
to know equipment needs, number of workers, kind of building, and so on. The firm also
needs to know the going wage rates for mechanics and unskilled laborers, the cost of gas
pumps, interest rates, the rents per square foot of land on high-traffic corners, and the whole-
sale price of gasoline. Of course, the firm also needs to know how much it can sell gasoline
and repair services for.
In the language of economics, a firm needs to know three things:
1. The market price of output
2. The techniques of production that are available
3. The prices of inputs
Output price determines potential revenues. The techniques available tell me how much of
each input I need, and input prices tell me how much they will cost. Together the available
production techniques and the prices of inputs determine costs.
The rest of this chapter and the next chapter focus on costs of production. We begin at the heart
of the firm, with the production process. Faced with a set of input prices, firms must decide on the
best, or optimal, method of production (Figure 7.2). The optimal method of production is the one
that minimizes cost. With cost determined and the market price of output known, a firm will make a
final judgment about the quantity of product to produce and the quantity of each input to demand.

The Production Process
Production is the process through which inputs are combined and transformed into outputs.
Production technology relates inputs to outputs. Specific quantities of inputs are needed to pro-
duce any given service or good.A loaf of bread requires certain amounts of water, flour, and yeast;
some kneading and patting; and an oven and gas or electricity. A trip from downtown New York
to Newark, New Jersey, can be produced with a taxicab, 45 minutes of a driver’s labor, some gaso-
line, and so on.
Most outputs can be produced by a number of different techniques. You can tear down an
old building and clear a lot to create a park in several ways, for example. Five hundred men and
women could descend on the park with sledgehammers and carry the pieces away by hand; this
would be a labor-intensive technology. The same park could be produced by two people with a
wrecking crane, a steam shovel, a backhoe, and a dump truck; this would be a capital-intensive
technology. Similarly, different inputs can be combined to transport people from Oakland to San
Francisco. The Bay Area Rapid Transit carries thousands of people simultaneously under San
Francisco Bay and uses a massive amount of capital relative to labor. Cab rides to San Francisco
require more labor relative to capital; a driver is needed for every few passengers.
In choosing the most appropriate technology, firms choose the one that minimizes the cost
of production. For a firm in an economy with a plentiful supply of inexpensive labor but not
much capital, the optimal method of production will involve labor-intensive techniques. For
example, assembly of items such as running shoes is done most efficiently by hand. That is why
Nike produces virtually all its shoes in developing countries where labor costs are very low. In
contrast, firms in an economy with high wages and high labor costs have an incentive to substi-
tute away from labor and to use more capital-intensive, or labor-saving, techniques. Suburban
office parks use more land and have more open space in part because land in the suburbs is more
plentiful and less expensive than land in the middle of a big city.
Production Functions: Total Product, Marginal Product,
and Average Product
The relationship between inputs and outputs—that is, the production technology—expressed
numerically or mathematically is called a production function (or total product function). A
production function shows units of total product as a function of units of inputs.
Imagine, for example, a small sandwich shop. All the sandwiches made in the shop are
grilled, and the shop owns only one grill, which can accommodate only two workers comfortably.
As columns 1 and 2 of the production function in Table 7.2 show, one person working alone can
produce only 10 sandwiches per hour in addition to answering the phone, waiting on customers,
keeping the tables clean, and so on. The second worker can stay at the grill full-time and not
worry about anything except making sandwiches. Because the two workers together can produce
25 sandwiches, the second worker can produce 25 - 10 = 15 sandwiches per hour. A third person
trying to use the grill produces crowding, but with careful use of space, more sandwiches can be

produced. The third worker adds 10 sandwiches per hour. Note that the added output from hir-
ing a third worker is less because of the capital constraint, not because the third worker is some-
how less efficient or hardworking. We assume that all workers are equally capable.
The fourth and fifth workers can work at the grill only while the first three are putting the
pickles, onions, and wrapping on the sandwiches they have made. Then the first three must wait
to get back to the grill. Worker four adds five sandwiches per hour to the total, and worker five
adds just two. Adding a sixth worker adds no output at all: The current maximum capacity of the
shop is 42 sandwiches per hour.
Figure 7.3(a) graphs the total product data from Table 7.2. As you look at Table 7.2 and think
about marginal product, you should begin to see how important the nature of the production
function is to a firm. We see that the sandwich firm that hires a fourth worker will be expanding
its sandwich production by five. Is it worth it? That will in turn depend on how much the worker
costs and for how much the shop can sell the sandwich. As we proceed to analyze the firm’s deci-
sion in the next few chapters, we will explore this further.
Marginal Product and the Law of Diminishing Returns
Marginal product is
the additional output that can be produced by hiring one more unit of a specific input, holding
all other inputs constant. As column 3 of Table 7.2 shows, the marginal product of the first unit of
labor in the sandwich shop is 10 sandwiches; the marginal product of the second is 15; the third,
10; and so on. The marginal product of the sixth worker is zero. Figure 7.3(b) graphs the mar-
ginal product of labor curve from the data in Table 7.2.

A production function is a numerical representation of the relationship between inputs and outputs. In
Figure 7.3(a), total product (sandwiches) is graphed as a function of labor inputs. The marginal product of
labor is the additional output that one additional unit of labor produces. Figure 7.3(b) shows that the
marginal product of the second unit of labor at the sandwich shop is 15 units of output; the marginal
product of the fourth unit of labor is 5 units of output.

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
The law of diminishing returns states that after a certain point, when additional units of a variable
input are added to fixed inputs (in this case, the building and grill), the marginal product of the variable
input (in this case, labor) declines. The British economist David Ricardo first formulated the law of
diminishing returns on the basis of his observations of agriculture in nineteenth-century England.
Within a given area of land, he noted, successive “doses” of labor and capital yielded smaller and
smaller increases in crop output. The law of diminishing returns is true in agriculture because only so
much more can be produced by farming the same land more intensely. In manufacturing, diminish-
ing returns set in when a firm begins to strain the capacity of its existing plant.
At our sandwich shop, diminishing returns set in when the third worker is added. The mar-
ginal product of the second worker is actually higher than the first [Figure 7.3(b)]. The first
worker takes care of the phone and the tables, thus freeing the second worker to concentrate
exclusively on sandwich making. From that point on, the grill gets crowded. It is important to
note here that diminishing returns are setting in, not because the third worker is worse than
workers one or two (we assume they are identical), but because as we add staff, each has a smaller
amount of capital (here a grill) to work with.
Diminishing returns, or diminishing marginal product, begin to show up when more and
more units of a variable input are added to a fixed input, such as the scale of the plant. Recall that
we defined the short run as that period in which some fixed factor of production constrains the
firm. It then follows that diminishing returns always apply in the short run and that in the short
run, every firm will face diminishing returns. This means that every firm finds it progressively
more difficult to increase its output as it approaches capacity production.
Marginal Product versus Average Product
Average product is the average
amount produced by each unit of a variable factor of production. At our sandwich shop with
one grill, that variable factor is labor. In Table 7.2, you saw that the first two workers together
produce 25 sandwiches per hour. Their average product is therefore 12.5 (25 ÷ 2). The third
worker adds only 10 sandwiches per hour to the total. These 10 sandwiches are the marginal
product of labor. The average product of the first three units of labor, however, is 11.7 (the aver-
age of 10, 15, and 10). Stated in equation form, the average product of labor is the total product
divided by total units of labor:
Average product “follows” marginal product, but it does not change as quickly. If marginal
product is above average product, the average rises; if marginal product is below average product,
the average falls. Suppose, for example, that you have had six exams and that your average is 86. If
you score 75 on the next exam, your average score will fall, but not all the way to 75. In fact, it will
fall only to 84.4. If you score a 95 instead, your average will rise to 87.3. As columns 3 and 4 of
Table 7.2 show, marginal product at the sandwich shop declines continuously after the third
worker is hired. Average product also decreases, but more slowly.
Figure 7.4 shows a typical production function and the marginal and average product curves
derived from it. The marginal product curve is a graph of the slope of the total product curve—
that is, of the production function. Average product and marginal product start out equal, as they
do in Table 7.2. As marginal product climbs, the graph of average product follows it, but more
slowly, up to L1 (point A).
Notice that marginal product starts out increasing. (It did so in the sandwich shop as well.)
Most production processes are designed to be run well by more than one worker. Take an assem-
bly line, for example. To work efficiently, an assembly line needs a worker at every station; it’s a
cooperative process. The marginal product of the first workers is low or zero. As workers are
added, the process starts to run and marginal product rises.
At point A (L1 units of labor), marginal product begins to fall. Because every plant has a finite
capacity, efforts to increase production will always run into the limits of that capacity. At point B
(L2 units of labor), marginal product has fallen to equal the average product, which has been
increasing. Between point B and point C (between L2 and L3 units of labor), marginal product falls
below average product and average product begins to follow it down.Average product is at its max-
imum at point B, where it is equal to marginal product. At L3, more labor yields no more output
and marginal product is zero—the assembly line has no more positions, the grill is jammed.

CHAPTER 7
The Production Process: The Behavior of Profit-Maximizing Firms 155
Production Functions with Two Variable Factors of
Production
So far, we have considered production functions with only one variable factor of production.
However, inputs work together in production. In general, additional capital increases the produc-
tivity of labor. Because capital—buildings, machines, and so on—is of no use without people to
operate it, we say that capital and labor are complementary inputs.
A simple example will clarify this point. Consider again the sandwich shop. If the demand
for sandwiches began to exceed the capacity of the shop to produce them, the shop’s owner
might decide to expand capacity. This would mean purchasing more capital in the form of a
new grill.
A second grill would essentially double the shop’s productive capacity. The new higher
capacity would mean that the sandwich shop would not run into diminishing returns as quickly.
With only one grill, the third and fourth workers are less productive because the single grill gets
crowded.With two grills, however, the third and fourth workers could produce 15 sandwiches per
hour using the second grill. In essence, the added capital raises the productivity of labor—that is,
the amount of output produced per worker per hour.
Just as the new grill enhances the productivity of workers in the sandwich shop, new busi-
nesses and the capital they put in place raise the productivity of workers in countries such as
Malaysia, India, and Kenya.
This simple relationship lies at the heart of worries about productivity at the national and
international levels. Building new, modern plants and equipment enhances a nation’s productiv-
ity. In the last decade, China has accumulated capital (that is, built plants and equipment) at a
very high rate. The result is growth in the average quantity of output per worker in China.

Choice of Technology
As our sandwich shop example shows, inputs (factors of production) are complementary. Capital
enhances the productivity of labor. Workers in the sandwich shop are more productive when they
are not crowded at a single grill. Similarly, labor enhances the productivity of capital. When more
workers are hired at a plant that is operating at 50 percent of capacity, previously idle machines
suddenly become productive.
However, inputs can also be substituted for one another. If labor becomes expensive, firms
can adopt labor-saving technologies; that is, they can substitute capital for labor. Assembly lines
can be automated by replacing human beings with machines, and capital can be substituted for
land when land is scarce. If capital becomes relatively expensive, firms can substitute labor for
capital. In short, most goods and services can be produced in a number of ways through the use
of alternative technologies. One of the key decisions that all firms must make is which technol-
ogy to use.
Consider the choices available to the diaper manufacturer in Table 7.3. Five different tech-
niques of producing 100 diapers are available. Technology A is the most labor-intensive, requir-
ing 10 hours of labor and 2 units of capital to produce 100 diapers. (You can think of units of
capital as machine hours.) Technology E is the most capital-intensive, requiring only 2 hours of
labor but 10 hours of machine time.

Learning about Growing Pineapples in Ghana
In this chapter we have focused on the way in which labor, capital,
and other inputs are used to produce outputs of various sorts. We
have described a somewhat abstract production function, linking
specific combinations of inputs and output levels. In reading this
chapter, you might have wondered where real people interested in
producing something learn about production functions. How does
an entrepreneur know what the ideal combination of inputs is to
produce a given output?
In a recent interesting article, Timothy Conley from Chicago and
Christopher Udry from Yale asked precisely this question in thinking
about the production of pineapples in Ghana. What they learned
helps us think about the production process more generally.
In farming, as in manufacturing, we need a given combination
of labor and capital to produce output, here a crop. The capital
doesn’t come in the form of a grill, as in the sandwich shop, but
tractors, or plows, or shovels. Raw materials include seeds and fer-
tilizer. There are clearly substitution possibilities among these
inputs; farmers can weed more and fertilize or water less, for
example. How does a farmer know what the right mix of inputs is,
given input prices?
Ghana proved to be an interesting place to ask this question. In
the 1990s, an area of Ghana changed from an exclusive reliance on
maize as the agricultural crop to the development of pineapple
farms. This transformation hap-
pened slowly over time to various
neighborhoods. Conley and Udry
found that social learning was
key in the process of technology
adoption. For farmers in Ghana,
the choice of how much fertilizer
to use was highly dependent on
how much fertilizer their more
successful neighbor farmers used.
Social learning was especially
important for novice pineapple
farmers located near more vet-
eran producers.1
Social learning obviously plays
a role in the diffusion of manufac-
turing technology as well. It is no accident that many high-tech
entrepreneurs began their careers in other high-tech firms where
they learned much about the right production techniques.

CHAPTER 7
The Production Process: The Behavior of Profit-Maximizing Firms 157
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
How Fast Should a Truck Driver Go?
The trucking business gives us an opportunity to think about choice
among technologies in a concrete way.
Suppose you own a truck and use it to haul merchandise for
retailers such as Target and Sears. Your typical run is 200 miles, and
you hire one person to drive the truck at a cost of $20 per hour. How
fast should you instruct him to drive the truck? Consider the cost
per trip.
Notice that even with fixed inputs of one truck and one driver,
you still have some choices to make. In the language of this chapter,
you can think of the choice as one of slow-drive technology (let’s say
50 mph) versus fast-drive technology (say, 60 mph).
If the driver’s time were the only input, the problem would be
simple: Labor costs are minimized if you tell him to drive fast. At
60 mph, a trip takes the driver only 3.33 hours (200 miles divided by
60 mph) and costs you $66.67 given his $20 wage rate. However, at a
speed of 50 mph, it takes four hours and costs you $80. With one
variable input, the best technology is the one that uses that input
most efficiently. In fact, with only one variable input, you would tell
the driver to speed regardless of his wage rate.
But, of course, trucks require not only drivers but also fuel,
which is where the question gets more interesting. As it turns out,
the fuel mileage that a truck gets diminishes with speed beyond
about 50 mph. Let’s say in this case that the truck gets 15 miles per
gallon at 50 mph but only 12 miles per gallon at 60 mph. Now we
have a trade-off. When you tell the driver to go fast, your labor
costs are lower but your fuel costs are higher.
So what instructions do you give? It should be clear that your
instructions depend on the price of fuel. First suppose that fuel costs
$3.50 per gallon. If the trucker drives fast, he will get 12 miles per
gallon. Since the trucker has to drive 200 miles per trip, he burns
16.66 gallons (200 divided by 12) and total fuel cost is $58.31.
Driving fast, the trucker goes 60 miles per hour. You have to pay him
for 3.33 hours (200 divided by 60), which at $20 per hour, is a total
of $66.67. The total for the trip is $124.98.
On the other hand,if your trucker drives slowly,he will get 15 miles
per gallon, which means you need only 13.33 gallons, which costs
$46.67. But now it takes more time. He takes four hours, and you
must pay him 4  $20, or $80 per trip. Total cost is now $126.67.
Thus, the cost-minimizing solution is to have him drive fast.
Now try a price of $4.50 per gallon. Doing the same calculations,
you should be able to show that when driving slowly, the total cost is
$139.99; when driving fast, the cost is $141.63. Thus, the higher fuel
price means that you tell the driver to slow down.
Going one step further, you should be able to show that at a fuel
price of $4, the trip costs the same whether your trucker drives fast
or slowly.
In fact, you should be able to see that at fuel prices in excess of
$4 per gallon, you tell your driver to slow down, while at cheaper
prices, you tell him to speed up.With more than one input, the choice
of technologies often depends on the unit cost of those inputs.
The observation that the optimal “technology” to use in truck-
ing depends on fuel prices is one reason we might expect accident
rates to fall with rises in fuel prices (in addition to the fact that
everyone drives less when fuel is expensive). Modern technology,
in the form of on-board computers, allows a modern trucking
firm to monitor driving speed and instruct drivers.
Here is a summary of the cost per trip.
To choose a production technique, the firm must look to input markets to learn the current
market prices of labor and capital.What is the wage rate (PL), and what is the cost per hour of capi-
tal (PK)? The right choice among inputs depends on how productive an input is and what its price is.
Suppose that labor and capital are both available at a price of $1 per unit. Column 4 of
Table 7.4 presents the calculations required to determine which technology is best. The winner
is technology C. Assuming that the firm’s objective is to maximize profits, it will choose the
least-cost technology. Using technology C, the firm can produce 100 diapers for $8. All four of
the other technologies produce 100 diapers at a higher cost.
Now suppose that the wage rate (PL) were to rise sharply, from $1 to $5.You might guess that
this increase would lead the firm to substitute labor-saving capital for workers, and you would be
right. As column 5 of Table 7.4 shows, the increase in the wage rate means that technology E is
now the cost-minimizing choice for the firm. Using 10 units of capital and only 2 units of labor,

the firm can produce 100 diapers for $20. All other technologies are now more costly. Notice too
from the table that the firm’s ability to shift its technique of production softened the impact of
the wage increase on its costs. The flexibility of a firm’s techniques of production is an important
determinant of its costs. Two things determine the cost of production: (1) technologies that are
available and (2) input prices. Profit-maximizing firms will choose the technology that mini-
mizes the cost of production given current market input prices.
Looking Ahead: Cost and Supply
So far, we have looked only at a single level of output. That is, we have determined how much it
will cost to produce 100 diapers using the best available technology when PK = $1 and PL = $1 or
$5. The best technique for producing 1,000 diapers or 10,000 diapers may be entirely different.
The next chapter explores the relationship between cost and the level of output in some detail.
One of our main objectives in that chapter is to determine the amount that a competitive firm
will choose to supply during a given time period.

S U M M A R Y
1. Firms vary in size and internal organization, but they all take
inputs and transform them into outputs through a process
called production.
2. In perfect competition, no single firm has any control over
prices. This follows from two assumptions: (1) Perfectly com-
petitive industries are composed of many firms, each small
relative to the size of the industry, and (2) each firm in a per-
fectly competitive industry produces homogeneous products.
3. The demand curve facing a competitive firm is perfectly
elastic. If a single firm raises its price above the market price,
it will sell nothing. Because it can sell all it produces at the
market price, a firm has no incentive to reduce price.
THE BEHAVIOR OF PROFIT-MAXIMIZING FIRMS p. 148
4. Profit-maximizing firms in all industries must make three
choices: (1) how much output to supply, (2) how to produce
that output, and (3) how much of each input to demand.
5. Profit equals total revenue minus total cost. Total cost (eco-
nomic cost) includes (1) out-of-pocket costs and (2) the
opportunity cost of each factor of production, including a
normal rate of return on capital.
6. A normal rate of return on capital is included in total cost
because tying up resources in a firm’s capital stock has an
opportunity cost. If you start a business or buy a share of
stock in a corporation, you do so because you expect to
make a normal rate of return. Investors will not invest their
money in a business unless they expect to make a normal
rate of return.
7. A positive profit level occurs when a firm is earning an
above-normal rate of return on capital.
8. Two assumptions define the short run: (1) a fixed scale or fixed
factor of production and (2) no entry to or exit from the
industry. In the long run, firms can choose any scale of opera-
tions they want and firms can enter and leave the industry.
9. To make decisions, firms need to know three things: (1) the
market price of their output, (2) the production techniques
that are available, and (3) the prices of inputs.
THE PRODUCTION PROCESS p. 152
10. The relationship between inputs and outputs (the production
technology) expressed numerically or mathematically is
called a production function or total product function.
11. The marginal product of a variable input is the additional
output that an added unit of that input will produce if all
other inputs are held constant. According to the law of
diminishing returns, when additional units of a variable
input are added to fixed inputs, after a certain point, the
marginal product of the variable input will decline.

CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY p. 156
14. One of the key decisions that all firms must make is which
technology to use. Profit-maximizing firms will choose the
combination of inputs that minimizes costs and therefore
maximizes profits.
12. Average product is the average amount of product produced
by each unit of a variable factor of production. If marginal
product is above average product, the average product rises;
if marginal product is below average product, the average
product falls.
13. Capital and labor are at the same time complementary and
substitutable inputs. Capital enhances the productivity of
labor, but it can also be substituted for labor.

1. Consider a firm that uses capital and labor as inputs and sells
5,000 units of output per year at the going market price of
$10. Also assume that total labor costs to the firm are $45,000
annually. Assume further that the total capital stock of the
firm is currently worth $100,000, that the return available to
investors with comparable risks is 10 percent annually, and
that there is no depreciation. Is this a profitable firm? Explain
your answer.
2. Two former Northwestern University students worked in an
investment bank at a salary of $60,000 each for 2 years after
they graduated. Together they saved $50,000. After 2 years,
they decided to quit their jobs and start a business designing
Web sites. They used the $50,000 to buy computer equipment,
desks, and chairs. For the next 2 years, they took in $40,000 in
revenue each year, paid themselves $10,000 annually each,
and rented an office for $18,000 per year. Prior to the invest-
ment, their $50,000 was in bonds earning interest at a rate of
10 percent. Are they now earning economic profits? Explain
your answer.
3. Suppose that in 2010, you became president of a small non-
profit theater company. Your playhouse has 120 seats and a
small stage. The actors have national reputations, and demand
for tickets is enormous relative to the number of seats available;
every performance is sold out months in advance. You are
elected because you have demonstrated an ability to raise funds
successfully. Describe some of the decisions that you must make
in the short run. What might you consider to be your “fixed fac-
tor”? What alternative decisions might you be able to make in
the long run? Explain.

8. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 156] Identical
sweaters can be made in one of two ways. With a machine
that can be rented for $50 per hour and a person to run the
machine who can be hired at $25 per hour, five sweaters 
can be produced in an hour using $10 worth of wool.
Alternatively, I can run the machine with a less skilled
worker, producing only four sweaters in an hour with the
same $10 worth of wool. (The less skilled worker is slower
and wastes material.) At what wage rate would I choose the
less skilled worker?
9. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 157] When the
price of fuel rises, we typically observe fewer accidents. Offer

losses from the standpoint of general accounting principles. Do
you agree or disagree with this argument? Explain why.

12. The number of repairs produced by a computer repair shop
depends on the number of workers as follows:
Assume that all inputs (office space, telephone, and utilities)
other than labor are fixed in the short run.
a. Add two additional columns to the table and enter the marginal
product and average product for each number of workers.
b. Over what range of labor input are there increasing
returns to labor? diminishing returns to labor? negative
returns to labor?
c. Over what range of labor input is marginal product greater
than average product? What is happening to average product
as employment increases over this range?
d. Over what range of labor input is marginal product smaller
than average product? What is happening to average product
as employment increases over this range?
13. Since the end of World War II, manufacturing firms in the United
States and in Europe have been moving farther and farther out-
side of central cities. At the same time, firms in finance, insurance,
and other parts of the service sector have been locating near
downtown areas in tall buildings. One major reason seems to be
that manufacturing firms find it difficult to substitute capital for
land, while service-sector firms that use office space do not.
a. What kinds of buildings represent substitution of capital 
for land?
b. Why do you think that manufacturing firms might find it
difficult to substitute capital for land?
c. Why is it relatively easier for a law firm or an insurance com-
pany to substitute capital for land?
d. Why is the demand for land likely to be very high near the
center of a city?
*e. One of the reasons for substituting capital for land near the
center of a city is that land is more expensive near the center.
What is true about the relative supply of land near the center
of a city? (Hint: What is the formula for the area of a circle?)
14. Ted Baxter runs a small, very stable newspaper company in
southern Oregon. The paper has been in business for 25 years.
The total value of the firm’s capital stock is $1 million, which Ted
owns outright. This year the firm earned a total of $250,000
after out-of-pocket expenses. Without taking the opportunity
cost of capital into account, this means that Ted is earning a 
25 percent return on his capital. Suppose that risk-free bonds
are currently paying a rate of 10 percent to those who buy them.
a. What is meant by the “opportunity cost of capital”?
b. Explain why opportunity costs are “real” costs even though
they do not necessarily involve out-of-pocket expenses.
c. Graph total cost of production as a function of output. (Put
cost on the Y-axis and output, q, on the X-axis.) Again
assume that the optimal technology is used.
d. Repeat a. through c. under the assumption that the price of
labor (PL) rises from $1 to $3 while the price of capital (PK)
remains at $2.
6. A female student who lives on the fourth floor of Bates Hall is
assigned to a new room on the seventh floor during her junior
year. She has 11 heavy boxes of books and “stuff” to move.
Discuss the alternative combinations of capital and labor that
might be used to make the move. How would your answer differ
if the move were to a new dorm 3 miles across campus and to a
new college 400 miles away?

16. An article on Techspot.com reported on the findings of the
marketing research firm iSuppli in its investigation of the cost of
the components used to produce the Amazon Kindle 2: “After
performing a “teardown,” the firm concluded that each Kindle 2
runs approximately $185.49 to produce in-total, or 52% less
than its [retail price] of $359.” Does this mean that Amazon is
making a profit of approximately $173 per Kindle 2?

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
Isoquants and Isocosts
This chapter has shown that the cost structure facing a firm
depends on two key pieces of information: (1) input (factor)
prices and (2) technology. This Appendix presents a more for-
mal analysis of technology and factor prices and their relation-
ship to cost.
New Look at Technology: Isoquants
Table 7A.1 is expanded from Table 7.3 to show the various com-
binations of capital (K) and labor (L) that can be used to pro-
duce three different levels of output (q). For example, 100 units
of X can be produced with 2 units of capital and 10 units of
labor, with 3 units of K and 6 units of L, or with 4 units of K and
4 units of L, and so on. Similarly, 150 units of X can be pro-
duced with 3 units of K and 10 units of L, with 4 units of K and
7 units of L, and so on.
point F to point G along the curve, less capital is employed
but more labor is used. An approximation of the amount of
output lost by using less capital is 
K times the marginal
product of capital (MPK). The marginal product of capital is
the number of units of output produced by a single marginal
unit of capital. Thus,
K · MPK is the total output lost by
using less capital.
For output to remain constant (as it must because F and G
are on the same isoquant), the loss of output from using less
capital must be matched by the added output produced by
using more labor. This amount can be approximated by 
L
times the marginal product of labor (MPL). Because the two
must be equal, it follows that
1
If we then divide both sides of this equation by 
L and
then by MPK, we arrive at the following expression for the
slope of the isoquant:
The ratio of MPL to MPK is called the marginal rate of
technical substitution. It is the rate at which a firm can sub-
stitute capital for labor and hold output constant.

A graph that shows all the combinations of capital and
labor that can be used to produce a given amount of output
is called an isoquant. Figure 7A.1 graphs three isoquants,
one each for qX = 50, qX = 100, and qX = 150 based on the
data in Table 7A.1. Notice that all the points on the graph
have been connected, indicating that there are an infinite
number of combinations of labor and capital that can pro-
duce each level of output. For example, 100 units of output
can also be produced with 3.50 units of labor and 4.75 units
of capital. (Verify that this point is on the isoquant labeled
qX = 100.)
Figure 7A.1 shows only three isoquants, but many more
are not shown. For example, there are separate isoquants for
qX = 101, qX = 102, and so on. If we assume that producing
fractions of a unit of output is possible, there must be an iso-
quant for qX = 134.57, for qX = 124.82, and so on. One could
imagine an infinite number of isoquants in Figure 7A.1. The
higher the level of output, the farther up and to the right the
isoquant will lie.
Figure 7A.2 derives the slope of an isoquant. Because
points F and G are both on the qX = 100 isoquant, the two
points represent two different combinations of K and L that
can be used to produce 100 units of output. In moving from

Factor Prices and Input Combinations:
Isocosts
A graph that shows all the combinations of capital and labor
that are available for a given total cost is called an isocost line.
(Recall that total cost includes opportunity costs and normal
rate of return.) Just as there are an infinite number of isoquants
(one for every possible level of output), there are an infinite
number of isocost lines, one for every possible level of total cost.
Figure 7A.3 shows three simple isocost lines assuming that
the price of labor (PL) is $1 per unit and the price of capital
(PK) is $1 per unit. The lowest isocost line shows all the combi-
nations of K and L that can be purchased for $5. For example,
$5 will buy 5 units of labor and no capital (point A), 3 units of
labor and 2 units of capital (point B), or no units of labor and
5 units of capital (point C). All these points lie along a straight
line. The equation of that straight line is
(PK · K) + (PL · L) = TC
Substituting our data for the lowest isocost line into this
general equation, we get
($1 · K) + ($1 · L) = $5, or K + L = 5
Remember that the X- and Y-scales are units of labor and units
of capital, not dollars.
On the same graph are two additional isocosts showing
the various combinations of K and L available for a total cost of
$6 and $7. These are only three of an infinite number of iso-
costs. At any total cost, there is an isocost that shows all the
combinations of K and L available for that amount.
Figure 7A.4 shows another isocost line. This isocost assumes
a different set of factor prices, PL = $5 and PK = $1. The diagram
shows all the combinations of K and L that can be bought for $25.
One way to draw the line is to determine the endpoints.For exam-
ple,if the entire $25 were spent on labor,how much labor could be
purchased? The answer is,of course,5 units ($25 divided by $5 per
unit).Thus,point A,which represents 5 units of labor and no cap-
ital, is on the isocost line. Similarly, if all of the $25 were spent on
capital, how much capital could be purchased? The answer is
25 units ($25 divided by $1 per unit). Thus, point B, which repre-
sents 25 units of capital and no labor, is also on the isocost line.
Another point on this particular isocost is 3 units of labor and
10 units of capital, point C.
The slope of an isocost line can be calculated easily if
you first find the endpoints of the line. In Figure 7A.4, we
can calculate the slope of the isocost line by taking 
K/
L
between points B and A. Thus,
Plugging in the endpoints from our example, we get
Finding the Least-Cost Technology with
Isoquants and Isocosts
Figure 7A.5 superimposes the isoquant for qX = 50 on the iso-
cost lines in Figure 7A.3, which assume that PK = $1 and PL =
$1. The question now becomes one of choosing among the
combinations of K and L that can be used to produce 50 units
of output. Recall that each point on the isoquant (labeled qX =
50 in Figure 7A.5) represents a different technology—a differ-
ent combination of K and L.
We assume that our firm is a perfectly competitive, profit-
maximizing firm that will choose the combination that minimizes

cost. Because every point on the isoquant lies on some particular
isocost line, we can determine the total cost for each combination
along the isoquant. For example, point D (5 units of capital and
2 units of labor) lies along the isocost for a total cost of $7. Notice
that 5 units of capital and 2 units of labor cost a total of $7.
(Remember, PK = $1 and PL = $1.) The same amount of output
(50 units) can be produced at lower cost. Specifically, by using
3 units of labor and 3 units of capital (point C), total cost is
reduced to $6. No other combination of K and L along isoquant
qX = 50 is on a lower isocost line.In seeking to maximize profits,the
firm will choose the combination of inputs that is least costly. The
least costly way to produce any given level of output is indicated by
the point of tangency between an isocost line and the isoquant
corresponding to that level of output.2

Profit-maximizing firms will minimize costs by producing their chosen

the isoquant is tangent to an isocost line. Here the cost-minimizing
technology—3 units of capital and 3 units of labor—is represented

The Cost-Minimizing Equilibrium
Condition
At the point where a line is just tangent to a curve, the two have
the same slope. (We have already derived expressions for the
slope of an isocost and the slope of an isoquant.) At each point
of tangency (such as at points A, B, and C in Figure 7A.6), the
following must be true:
Thus,
Dividing both sides by PL and multiplying both sides by
MPK, we get
This is the firm’s cost-minimizing equilibrium condition.
This expression makes sense if you think about what it says.

In Figure 7A.5, the least-cost technology of producing

the isocost line.
Figure 7A.6 adds the other two isoquants from Figure 7A.1

will move along each of the three isoquants until it finds the

duce that particular level of output. The result is plotted in

can hire workers for $2,000 each. Currently, the company is
using 2 units of capital and 5 workers to produce 10,000 units of
output. This combination of capital and labor represents a cost-
minimizing equilibrium. Draw an isoquant/isocost diagram to
illustrate this situation.
5. The Red Racer Company and the Blue Bomber Company are
each capable of minimizing cost and producing 4,000 bicy-
cles per month. Red Racer’s factory is located in an area
where the cost of labor is significantly less and the cost of
capital is significantly more than the costs of labor and
capital for Blue Bomber. Assume that each company has
access to the same technology to produce bicycles and draw
an isoquant/isocost diagram to illustrate why the cost-minimizing
combinations of inputs for these companies are different. Be
sure to identify the isocost line, amount of capital, amount 
of labor, and cost-minimizing combination of inputs for
each company.

Short-Run Costs and
Output Decisions
This chapter continues our exami-
nation of the decisions that firms
make in their quest for profits. You
have seen that firms make three
specific decisions (Figure 8.1)
involving their production. These
decisions are:
1. How much output to supply
2. How to produce that output
—that is, which production
technique/technology to use
3. What quantity of each input
to demand
We have assumed so far that firms are in business to earn profits and that they make choices
to maximize those profits. (Remember that profit refers to economic profit, the difference
between revenues and costs—full economic costs.)
In the last chapter, we focused on the production process. This chapter focuses on the costs of
production. To calculate costs, a firm must know two things: what quantity and combination of
inputs it needs to produce its product and how much those inputs cost. (Do not forget that eco-
nomic costs include a normal return to capital—the opportunity cost of capital.)
Take a moment and look back at the circular flow diagram, Figure II.1 on p. 117. There you
can see where we are in our study of the competitive market system. The goal of this chapter is
to look behind the supply curve in output markets. It is important to understand, however, that
producing output implies demanding inputs at the same time. You can also see in Figure II.1
two of the information sources that firms use in their output supply and input demand deci-
sions: Firms look to output markets for the price of output and to input markets for the prices
of capital and labor.

where TC denotes total costs, TFC denotes total fixed costs, and TVC denotes total variable costs.
We will return to this equation after discussing fixed costs and variable costs in detail.
Fixed Costs
In discussing fixed costs, we must distinguish between total fixed costs and average fixed costs.
Total Fixed Cost (TFC)
Total fixed cost is sometimes called overhead. If you operate a fac-
tory, you must heat the building to keep the pipes from freezing in the winter. Even if no produc-
tion is taking place, you may have to keep the roof from leaking, pay a guard to protect the
building from vandals, and make payments on a long-term lease. There may also be insurance
premiums, taxes, and city fees to pay, as well as contract obligations to workers.
Fixed costs represent a larger portion of total costs for some firms than for others. Electric
companies, for instance, maintain generating plants, thousands of miles of distribution wires,
poles, transformers, and so on. Usually, such plants are financed by issuing bonds to the public—
that is, by borrowing. The interest that must be paid on these bonds represents a substantial part
of the utilities’ operating cost and is a fixed cost in the short run, no matter how much (if any)
electricity they are producing.
For the purposes of our discussion in this chapter, we will assume that firms use only two
inputs: labor and capital. Although this may seem unrealistic, virtually everything that we will say
about firms using these two factors can easily be generalized to firms that use many factors of pro-
duction. Recall that capital yields services over time in the production of other goods and services.
It is the plant and equipment of a manufacturing firm and the computers, desks, chairs, doors, and
walls of a law office; it is the software of a Web-based firm and the boat that Bill and Colleen built
on their desert island. It is sometimes assumed that capital is a fixed input in the short run and that
labor is the only variable input. To be more realistic, however, we will assume that capital has both
a fixed and a variable component. After all, some capital can be purchased in the short run.
Consider a small consulting firm that employs several economists, research assistants, and
secretaries. It rents space in an office building and has a 5-year lease. The rent on the office space
can be thought of as a fixed cost in the short run. The monthly electric and heating bills are also
essentially fixed (although the amounts may vary slightly from month to month). So are the
salaries of the basic administrative staff. Payments on some capital equipment—a large copying
machine and the main word-processing system, for instance—can also be thought of as fixed.
The same firm also has costs that vary with output. When there is a great deal of work, the
firm hires more employees at both the professional and research assistant levels. The capital
used by the consulting firm may also vary, even in the short run. Payments on the computer
system do not change, but the firm may rent additional computer time when necessary. The firm
can buy additional personal computers, network terminals, or databases quickly if needed. It must
pay for the copy machine, but the machine costs more when it is running than when it is not.
Total fixed costs (TFC) or overhead are those costs that do not change with output even if
output is zero. Column 2 of Table 8.1 presents data on the fixed costs of a hypothetical firm. Fixed
costs are $1,000 at all levels of output (q). Figure 8.2(a) shows total fixed costs as a function of
total fixed costs (TFC) or
overhead
The total of all
costs that do not change with
output even if output 
is zero.
Costs in the Short Run
Our emphasis in this chapter is on costs in the short run only. Recall that the short run is that
period during which two conditions hold: (1) existing firms face limits imposed by some fixed
factor of production, and (2) new firms cannot enter and existing firms cannot exit an industry.
In the short run, all firms (competitive and noncompetitive) have costs that they must bear
regardless of their output. In fact, some costs must be paid even if the firm stops producing—that
is, even if output is zero. These costs are called fixed costs, and firms can do nothing in the short
run to avoid them or to change them. In the long run, a firm has no fixed costs because it can
expand, contract, or exit the industry.
Firms also have certain costs in the short run that depend on the level of output they have
chosen. These kinds of costs are called variable costs. Total fixed costs and total variable costs
together make up total costs:
TC = TFC + TVC

Average fixed cost is simply total fixed cost divided by the quantity of output. As output increases, average
fixed cost declines because we are dividing a fixed number ($1,000) by a larger and larger quantity.
output. Because TFC does not change with output, the graph is simply a straight horizontal line
at $1,000. The important thing to remember here is that firms have no control over fixed costs in
the short run.
Average Fixed Cost (AFC)
Average fixed cost (AFC) is total fixed cost (TFC) divided by
the number of units of output (q):
AFC = TFC
q
average fixed cost (AFC)
Total fixed cost divided by the
number of units of output; a
per-unit measure of fixed costs.
For example, if the firm in Figure 8.2 produced 3 units of output, average fixed costs would
be $333 ($1,000  3). If the same firm produced 5 units of output, average fixed cost would be
$200 ($1,000  5). Average fixed cost falls as output rises because the same total is being spread
over, or divided by, a larger number of units (see column 3 of Table 8.1). This phenomenon is
sometimes called spreading overhead.
Graphs of average fixed cost, like that in Figure 8.2(b) (which presents the average fixed cost
data from Table 8.1), are downward-sloping curves. Notice that AFC approaches zero as the
quantity of output increases. If output were 100,000 units, average fixed cost would equal only
1 cent per unit in our example ($1,000  100,000 = $0.01). AFC never actually reaches zero.
Variable Costs
Total Variable Cost (TVC)
Total variable cost (TVC) is the sum of those costs that vary
with the level of output in the short run. To produce more output, a firm uses more inputs. The
cost of additional output depends directly on what additional inputs are required and how much
they cost.

As you saw in Chapter 7, input requirements are determined by technology. Firms generally
have a number of production techniques available to them, and the option they choose is
assumed to be the one that produces the desired level of output at the least cost. To find out which
technology involves the least cost, a firm must compare the total variable costs of producing that
level of output using different production techniques.
This is as true of small businesses as it is of large manufacturing firms. Suppose, for example,
that you own a small farm. A certain amount of work has to be done to plant and harvest your
120 acres.You might hire four farmhands and divide up the tasks, or you might buy several pieces
of complex farm machinery (capital) and do the work single-handedly.Your final choice depends
on a number of things. What machinery is available? What does it do? Will it work on small fields
such as yours? How much will it cost to buy each piece of equipment? What wage will you have to
pay farmhands? How many will you need to hire to get the job done? If machinery is expensive
and labor is cheap, you will probably choose the labor-intensive technology. If farm labor is
expensive and the local farm equipment dealer is going out of business, you might get a good deal
on some machinery and choose the capital-intensive method.
Having compared the costs of alternative production techniques, the firm may be influenced
in its choice by the current scale of its operation. Remember, in the short run, a firm is locked into
a fixed scale of operations. A firm currently producing on a small scale may find that a labor-
intensive technique is least costly whether or not labor is comparatively expensive. The same firm
producing on a larger scale might find a capital-intensive technique to be less costly.
The total variable cost curve is a graph that shows the relationship between total variable cost
and the level of a firm’s output (q).At any given level of output, total variable cost depends on (1) the
techniques of production that are available and (2) the prices of the inputs required by each techno-
logy. To examine this relationship in more detail, let us look at some hypothetical production figures.
Table 8.2 presents an analysis that might lie behind three points on a typical firm’s total variable
cost curve. In this case, there are two production techniques available, A and B, one somewhat more
capital-intensive than the other. We will assume that the price of labor is $1 per unit and the price of
capital is $2 per unit. For the purposes of this example, we focus on variable capital—that is, on cap-
ital that can be changed in the short run. In practice, some capital (such as buildings and large, spe-
cialized machines) is fixed in the short run. In our example, we will use K to denote variable capital.
Remember, however, that the firm has other capital, capital that is fixed in the short run.
Analysis reveals that to produce 1 unit of output, the labor-intensive technique is least costly.
Technique A requires 4 units of both capital and labor, which would cost a total of $12. Technique B
requires 6 units of labor but only 2 units of capital for a total cost of only $10. To maximize prof-
its, the firm would use technique B to produce 1 unit. The total variable cost of producing 1 unit
of output would thus be $10.
The relatively labor-intensive technique B is also the best method of production for 2 units of out-
put. By using B, the firm can produce 2 units for $18. If the firm decides to produce 3 units of output,
however, technique A is cheaper. By using the least-cost technology (A), the total variable cost of pro-
duction is $24. The firm will use 9 units of capital at $2 each and 6 units of labor at $1 each.
Figure 8.3 graphs the relationship between total variable cost and output based on the data
in Table 8.2, assuming the firm chooses the least-cost technology for each output. The total

variable cost curve embodies information about both factor, or input, prices and technology. It
shows the cost of production using the best available technique at each output level given cur-
rent factor prices.
Marginal Cost (MC)
The most important of all cost concepts is that of marginal cost
(MC), the increase in total cost that results from the production of 1 more unit of output. Let us
say, for example, that a firm is producing 1,000 units of output per period and decides to raise its
rate of output to 1,001. Producing the extra unit raises costs, and the increase—that is, the cost of
producing the 1,001st unit—is the marginal cost. Focusing on the “margin” is one way of looking
at variable costs: marginal costs reflect changes in variable costs because they vary when output
changes. Fixed costs do not change when output changes.
Table 8.3 shows how marginal cost is derived from total variable cost by simple subtraction.
The total variable cost of producing the first unit of output is $10. Raising production from 1 unit
to 2 units increases total variable cost from $10 to $18; the difference is the marginal cost of the
second unit, or $8. Raising output from 2 to 3 units increases total variable cost from $18 to $24.
The marginal cost of the third unit, therefore, is $6.
It is important to think for a moment about the nature of marginal cost. Specifically, mar-
ginal cost is the cost of the added inputs, or resources, needed to produce 1 additional unit of
output. Look back at Table 8.2 and think about the additional capital and labor needed to go
from 1 unit to 2 units. Producing 1 unit of output with technique B requires 2 units of capital and
6 units of labor; producing 2 units of output using the same technique requires 4 units of capital
and 10 units of labor. Thus, the second unit requires 2 additional units of capital and 4 additional
units of labor. What, then, is the added, or marginal, cost of the second unit? Two units of capital
cost $2 each ($4 total) and 4 units of labor cost $1 each (another $4), for a total marginal cost of
$8, which is the number we derived in Table 8.3. Although the easiest way to derive marginal cost
is to look at total variable cost and subtract, do not lose sight of the fact that when a firm increases
its output level, it hires or demands more inputs. Marginal cost measures the additional cost of
inputs required to produce each successive unit of output.

increase in total cost that
results from producing 1 more
unit of output. Marginal costs

 FIGURE 8.4 Declining Marginal Product Implies That Marginal Cost Will
Eventually Rise with Output
In the short run, every firm is constrained by some fixed factor of production. A fixed factor implies diminish-
ing returns (declining marginal product) and a limited capacity to produce. As that limit is approached, mar-
ginal costs rise.
The Shape of the Marginal Cost Curve in the Short Run
The assumption of a
fixed factor of production in the short run means that a firm is stuck at its current scale of oper-
ation (in our example, the size of the plant). As a firm tries to increase its output, it will eventu-
ally find itself trapped by that scale. Thus, our definition of the short run also implies that
marginal cost eventually rises with output. The firm can hire more labor and use more materials—
that is, it can add variable inputs—but diminishing returns eventually set in.
Recall from Chapter 7 the sandwich shop with one grill and too many workers trying to pre-
pare sandwiches on it. With a fixed grill capacity, more laborers could make more sandwiches,
but the marginal product of each successive cook declined as more people tried to use the grill. If
each additional unit of labor adds less and less to total output, it follows that more labor is needed
to produce each additional unit of output. Thus, each additional unit of output costs more to
produce. In other words, diminishing returns, or decreasing marginal product, imply increasing
marginal cost as illustrated in Figure 8.4.
To reiterate:
In the short run, every firm is constrained by some fixed input that (1) leads to diminish-
ing returns to variable inputs and (2) limits its capacity to produce. As a firm approaches
that capacity, it becomes increasingly costly to produce successively higher levels of output.
Marginal costs ultimately increase with output in the short run.
Graphing Total Variable Costs and Marginal Costs
Figure 8.5 shows the total
variable cost curve and the marginal cost curve of a typical firm. Notice first that the shape of the
marginal cost curve is consistent with short-run diminishing returns. At first, MC declines, but
eventually the fixed factor of production begins to constrain the firm and marginal cost rises. Up
to 100 units of output, producing each successive unit of output costs slightly less than producing
the one before. Beyond 100 units, however, the cost of each successive unit is greater than the one
before. (Remember the sandwich shop.)
More output costs more than less output. Total variable costs (TVC), therefore, always
increase when output increases. Even though the cost of each additional unit changes, total vari-
able cost rises when output rises. Thus, the total variable cost curve always has a positive slope.
You might think of the total variable cost curve as a staircase. Each step takes you out along
the quantity axis by a single unit, and the height of each step is the increase in total variable cost.

Total variable costs always increase with output. Marginal cost is the cost of producing each additional unit.
Thus, the marginal cost curve shows how total variable cost changes with single-unit increases in total output.
As you climb the stairs, you are always going up, but the steps have different heights. At first, the
stairway is steep, but as you climb, the steps get smaller (marginal cost declines). The 100th stair
is the smallest. As you continue to walk out beyond 100 units, the steps begin to get larger; the
staircase gets steeper (marginal cost increases).
Remember that the slope of a line is equal to the change in the units measured on the Y-axis
divided by the change in the units measured on the X-axis. The slope of a total variable cost curve
is thus the change in total variable cost divided by the change in output ( TVC/ q). Because
marginal cost is by definition the change in total variable cost resulting from an increase in out-
put of one unit ( q = 1), marginal cost actually is the slope of the total variable cost curve:
slope of TVC = ¢TVC

= ¢TVC

Notice that up to 100 units, marginal cost decreases and the variable cost curve becomes flat-
ter. The slope of the total variable cost curve is declining—that is, total variable cost increases, but
at a decreasing rate. Beyond 100 units of output, marginal cost increases and the total variable cost
curve gets steeper—total variable costs continue to increase, but at an increasing rate.
A more complete picture of the costs of a hypothetical firm appears in Table 8.4.Column 2 shows
total variable costs derived from information on input prices and technology.Column 3 derives mar-
ginal cost by simple subtraction.For example,raising output from 3 units to 4 units increases variable
costs from $24 to $32, making the marginal cost of the fourth unit $8 ($32 – $24). The marginal cost
of the fifth unit is $10, the difference between $32 (TVC) for 4 units and $42 (TVC) for 5 units.

In Table 8.4, we calculate AVC in column 4 by dividing the numbers in column 2 (TVC) by the num-
bers in column 1 (q). For example, if the total variable cost of producing 5 units of output is $42, then
the average variable cost is $42  5, or $8.40. Marginal cost is the cost of 1 additional unit. Average
variable cost is the total variable cost divided by the total number of units produced.

Graphing Average Variable Costs and Marginal Costs
The relationship between
average variable cost and marginal cost can be illustrated graphically. When marginal cost is
below average variable cost, average variable cost declines toward it. When marginal cost is above
average variable cost, average variable cost increases toward it.
Figure 8.6 duplicates the bottom graph for a typical firm in Figure 8.5 but adds average vari-
able cost. As the graph shows, average variable cost follows marginal cost but lags behind. As we
move from left to right, we are looking at higher and higher levels of output per period. As we
increase production, marginal cost—which at low levels of production is above $3.50 per unit—
falls as coordination and cooperation begin to play a role.At 100 units of output, marginal cost has
fallen to $2.50. Notice that average variable cost falls as well, but not as rapidly as marginal cost.
After 100 units of output, we begin to see diminishing returns. Marginal cost begins to
increase as higher and higher levels of output are produced. However, notice that average cost
is still falling until 200 units because marginal cost remains below it. At 100 units of output,
marginal cost is $2.50 per unit but the average variable cost of production is $3.50. Thus,
even though marginal cost is rising after 100 units, it is still pulling the average of $3.50
downward.

CHAPTER 8
Short-Run Costs and Output Decisions 175
At 200 units, however, marginal cost has risen to $3 and average cost has fallen to $3; mar-
ginal and average costs are equal. At this point, marginal cost continues to rise with higher out-
put. From 200 units upward, MC is above AVC and thus exerts an upward pull on the average
variable cost curve. At levels of output below 200 units, marginal cost is below average variable
cost and average variable cost decreases as output increases. At levels of output above 200 units,
MC is above AVC and AVC increases as output increases. If you follow this logic, you will see
that marginal cost intersects average variable cost at the lowest, or minimum, point of AVC.
An example using test scores should help you understand the relationship between MC and
AVC. Consider the following sequence of test scores: 95, 85, 92, 88. The average of these four
scores is 90. Suppose you get an 80 on your fifth test. This score will drag down your average to
88. Now suppose you get an 85 on your sixth test. This score is higher than 80, but its still below
your 88 average. As a result, your average continues to fall (from 88 to 87.5) even though your
marginal test score rose. If instead of an 85 you get an 89—just one point over your average—you
have turned your average around; it is now rising.
Total Costs
We are now ready to complete the cost picture by adding total fixed costs to total variable costs.
Recall that
TC = TFC + TVC
Total cost is graphed in Figure 8.7, where the same vertical distance (equal to TFC, which is con-
stant) is simply added to TVC at every level of output. In Table 8.4, column 6 adds the total fixed
cost of $1,000 to total variable cost to arrive at total cost.
Average Total Cost (ATC)
Average total cost (ATC) is total cost divided by the number
of units of output (q):
Column 8 in Table 8.4 shows the result of dividing the costs in column 6 by the quantities in col-
umn 1. For example, at 5 units of output, total cost is $1,042; average total cost is $1,042  5, or
$208.40. The average total cost of producing 500 units of output is only $18—that is, $9,000  500.
Another, more revealing, way of deriving average total cost is to add average fixed cost and
average variable cost together:
ATC = AFC + AVC
For example, column 8 in Table 8.4 is the sum of column 4 (AVC) and column 7 (AFC).

amount equal to TFC.

Fixed Cost
To get average total cost, we add
average fixed and average vari-
able costs at all levels of output.
Because average fixed cost falls
with output, an ever-declining
amount is added to AVC. Thus,
AVC and ATC get closer together
as output increases, but the two
lines never meet.
Figure 8.8 derives average total cost graphically for a typical firm. The bottom part of the
figure graphs average fixed cost. At 100 units of output, average fixed cost is TFC/q = $1,000 
100 = $10. At 400 units of output, AFC = $1,000  400 = $2.50. The top part of Figure 8.8 shows
the declining AFC added to AVC at each level of output. Because AFC gets smaller and smaller,
ATC gets closer and closer to AVC as output increases, but the two lines never meet.
The Relationship Between Average Total Cost and Marginal Cost
The rela-
tionship between average total cost and marginal cost is exactly the same as the relationship
between average variable cost and marginal cost. The average total cost curve follows the mar-
ginal cost curve but lags behind because it is an average over all units of output. The average total
cost curve lags behind the marginal cost curve even more than the average variable cost curve
does because the cost of each added unit of production is now averaged not only with the variable
cost of all previous units produced but also with fixed costs.
Fixed costs equal $1,000 and are incurred even when the output level is zero. Thus, the first
unit of output in the example in Table 8.4 costs $10 in variable cost to produce. The second unit
costs only $8 in variable cost to produce. The total cost of 2 units is $1,018; average total cost
of the two is ($1,010 + $8)/2, or $509. The marginal cost of the third unit is only $6. The total
cost of 3 units is thus $1,024, or $1,018 + $6, and the average total cost of 3 units is ($1,010 +
$8 + $6)/3, or $341.
As you saw with the test scores example, marginal cost is what drives changes in average total
cost. If marginal cost is below average total cost, average total cost will decline toward marginal cost.
If marginal cost is above average total cost, average total cost will increase.As a result, marginal cost

intersects average total cost at ATC’s minimum point for the same reason that it intersects the aver-
age variable cost curve at its minimum point.
Short-Run Costs: A Review
Let us now pause to review what we have learned about the behavior of firms.We know that firms
make three basic choices: how much product or output to produce or supply, how to produce
that output, and how much of each input to demand to produce what they intend to supply. We
assume that these choices are made to maximize profits. Profits are equal to the difference
between a firm’s revenue from the sale of its product and the costs of producing that product:
profit = total revenue – total cost.
So far, we have looked only at costs, but costs are just one part of the profit equation. To com-
plete the picture, we must turn to the output market and see how these costs compare with the
price that a product commands in the market. Before we do so, however, it is important to con-
solidate what we have said about costs.
Before a firm does anything else, it needs to know the different methods that it can use to
produce its product. The technologies available determine the combinations of inputs that are
needed to produce each level of output. Firms choose the technique that produces the desired
level of output at the least cost. The cost curves that result from the analysis of all this informa-
tion show the cost of producing each level of output using the best available technology.
Remember that so far, we have talked only about short-run costs. The curves we have drawn
are therefore short-run cost curves. The shape of these curves is determined in large measure by
the assumptions that we make about the short run, especially the assumption that some fixed fac-
tor of production leads to diminishing returns. Given this assumption, marginal costs eventually
rise and average cost curves are likely to be U-shaped. Table 8.5 summarizes the cost concepts that
we have discussed.
After gaining a complete knowledge of how to produce a product and how much it will cost
to produce it at each level of output, the firm turns to the market to find out what it can sell its
product for. We now turn our attention to the output market.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Average and Marginal Costs at a College
Pomona College in California has an annual operating budget of
$120 million. With this budget, the college educates and houses
1,500 students. So the average total cost of educating a Pomona stu-
dent is $80,000 per year, some of which comes from the college
endowment and gifts. Suppose college administrators are consider-
ing a small increase in the number of students it accepts and believe
they could do so without sacrificing quality of teaching and
research. Given that the level of tuition and room and board is con-
siderably less than $80,000, can the administrators make a financial
case to support such a move?
The key issue here is to recognize that for a college like
Pomona—and indeed for most colleges—the average total cost of
educating a student is higher than the marginal cost. For a very
small increase in the number of students, the course-related
expenses probably would not go up at all. These students could
likely be absorbed into existing courses with no added expense for
faculty, buildings, or administrators. Housing might be more of a
constraint, but even in that regard administrators might find some
flexibility. Thus, from a financial perspective, the key question
about expansion is not how the average total cost of education
compares to the tuition, but how tuition compares to the marginal
cost. For this reason, many colleges would, in fact, find it financially
advantageous to expand student populations if they could do so
without changing the quality and environment of the school.
Suppose that of Pomona’s $120 million budget, $60 million
was fixed costs: maintenance of the physical campus, basic
salaries, and other fixed operating costs. Suppose further that the
full marginal cost of providing the education was $40,000 per stu-
dent and constant. Using these figures, one can easily create the
following table and draw the cost curves.
The cost curves also help us understand the downward spiral
that can affect colleges as their populations fall. In 2005, Antioch
College in Ohio announced that it would be phasing out its
undergraduate program. The culprit? Declining attendance
caused the average total cost of educating the remaining few stu-
dents to skyrocket despite attempts to control costs. Given the
inevitability of some fixed costs of education (to educate even a
modest student body requires facilities and a college president, for
example), as the number of students falls, the average total cost—
which is total cost divided by the number of students—rises. For
organizations such as colleges and museums, the numbers game is
very important to their survival.

CHAPTER 8
Short-Run Costs and Output Decisions 179
Output Decisions: Revenues, Costs, and
Profit Maximization
To calculate potential profits, firms must combine their cost analyses with information on poten-
tial revenues from sales. After all, if a firm cannot sell its product for more than the cost of pro-
duction, it will not be in business long. In contrast, if the market gives the firm a price that is
significantly greater than the cost it incurs to produce a unit of its product, the firm may have an
incentive to expand output. Large profits might also attract new competitors to the market.
Let us now examine in detail how a firm goes about determining how much output to pro-
duce. We will begin by examining the decisions of a perfectly competitive firm.
Perfect Competition
Perfect competition exists in an industry that contains many relatively small firms producing
identical products. In a perfectly competitive industry, no single firm has any control over prices.
In other words, an individual firm cannot affect the market price of its product or the prices of
the inputs that it buys. This important characteristic follows from two assumptions. First, a com-
petitive industry is composed of many firms, each small relative to the size of the industry.
Second, every firm in a perfectly competitive industry produces homogeneous products, which
means that one firm’s output cannot be distinguished from the output of the others.
These assumptions limit the decisions open to competitive firms and simplify the analysis of
competitive behavior. Firms in perfectly competitive industries do not differentiate their prod-
ucts and do not make decisions about price. Instead, each firm takes prices as given—that is, as
determined in the market by the laws of supply and demand—and decides only how much to
produce and how to produce it.
The idea that competitive firms are “price-takers” is central to our discussion. Of course, we
do not mean that firms cannot affix price tags to their merchandise; all firms have this ability. We
mean that given the availability of perfect substitutes, any product priced over the market price
will not be sold.
These assumptions also imply that the demand for the product of a competitive firm is per-
fectly elastic (Chapter 5). For example, consider the Ohio corn farmer whose situation is shown
in Figure 8.9. The left side of the diagram represents the current conditions in the market. Corn
is currently selling for $6.00 per bushel.1 The right side of the diagram shows the demand for corn
as the farmer sees it. If she were to raise her price, she would sell no corn at all; because there are
perfect substitutes available, the quantity demanded of her corn would drop to zero. To lower her
price would be silly because she can sell all she wants at the current price. (Remember, each
farmer’s production is very small relative to the entire corn market.)

industry structure in which
there are many firms, each

and in which no firm is large

and exit the market.

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
total revenue (TR)
The total
amount that a firm takes in
from the sale of its product:
the price per unit times the
quantity of output the firm
decides to produce (P  q).
Marginal revenue (MR) is the added revenue that a firm takes in when it increases out-
put by 1 additional unit. If a firm producing 10,521 units of output per month increases that
output to 10,522 units per month, it will take in an additional amount of revenue each
month. The revenue associated with the 10,522nd unit is the amount for which the firm sells
that 1 unit. Thus, for a competitive firm, marginal revenue is equal to the current market price
of each additional unit sold. In Figure 8.9, for example, the market price is $6.00. Thus, if the
representative firm raises its output from 10,521 units to 10,522 units, its revenue will
increase by $6.00.
A firm’s marginal revenue curve shows how much revenue the firm will gain by raising out-
put by 1 unit at every level of output. The marginal revenue curve and the demand curve facing a
competitive firm are identical. The horizontal line in Figure 8.9(b) can be thought of as both the
demand curve facing the firm and its marginal revenue curve:
P* = d = MR
marginal revenue (MR)
The
additional revenue that a firm
takes in when it increases
output by one additional unit.
In perfect competition, P = MR.
In perfect competition, we also assume easy entry—that firms can easily enter and exit the
industry. If firms in an industry are earning high profits, new firms are likely to spring up. There
are no barriers that prevent a new firm from competing. Fast-food restaurants are quick to
spring up when a new shopping center opens, and new gas stations appear when a housing
development or a new highway is built. When it became clear a number of years ago that many
people would be buying products online, thousands of e-commerce start-ups flooded the Web
with new online “shops.”
We also assume easy exit. When a firm finds itself suffering losses or earning low profits, one
option is to go out of business, or exit the industry. Everyone knows a favorite restaurant that
went out of business. Changes in cost of production, falling prices from international or regional
competition, and changing technology may turn business profits into losses and failure.
The best examples of perfect competition are probably found in agriculture. In that
industry, products are absolutely homogeneous—it is impossible to distinguish one farmer’s
wheat from another’s—and prices are set by the forces of supply and demand in a huge
national market.
Total Revenue and Marginal Revenue 
Profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost. Total revenue (TR) is the total
amount that a firm takes in from the sale of its product. A perfectly competitive firm sells each
unit of product for the same price, regardless of the output level it has chosen. Therefore, total
revenue is simply the price per unit times the quantity of output that the firm decides to produce:
TR = P * q
total revenue = price * quantity
Comparing Costs and Revenues to Maximize Profit
The discussion in the next few paragraphs conveys one of the most important concepts in all of
microeconomics. As we pursue our analysis, remember that we are working under two assump-
tions: (1) that the industry we are examining is perfectly competitive and (2) that firms choose
the level of output that yields the maximum total profit.
The Profit-Maximizing Level of Output
Look carefully at the graphs in Figure 8.10.
Once again, we have the whole market, or industry, on the left and a single, typical small firm on the
right. And again the current market price is P*.
First, the firm observes the market price [Figure 8.10(a)] and knows that it can sell all that it
wants for P* = $5 per unit. Next, the firm must decide how much to produce. It might seem rea-
sonable for the firm to pick the output level where marginal cost is at its minimum point—in this
case, at an output of 100 units. Here the difference between marginal revenue, $5.00, and mar-
ginal cost, $2.50, is the greatest. As it happens, 100 units is not the optimal production level.

 FIGURE 8.10 The Profit-Maximizing Level of Output for a Perfectly
Competitive Firm
If price is above marginal cost, as it is at 100 and 250 units of output, profits can be increased by raising out-
put; each additional unit increases revenues by more than it costs to produce the additional output. Beyond
q* = 300, however, added output will reduce profits. At 340 units of output, an additional unit of output
costs more to produce than it will bring in revenue when sold on the market. Profit-maximizing output is thus
q*, the point at which P* = MC.
Remember that a firm wants to maximize the difference between total revenue and total cost,
not the difference between marginal revenue and marginal cost. The fact that marginal revenue is
greater than marginal cost at a level of 100 indicates that profit is not being maximized. Think
about the 101st unit. Adding that single unit to production each period adds $5.00 to revenues
but adds only about $2.50 to cost. Profits each period would be higher by about $2.50. Thus, the
optimal (profit-maximizing) level of output is clearly higher than 100 units.
Now look at an output level of 250 units. Here, once again, raising output increases
profit. The revenue gained from producing the 251st unit (marginal revenue) is still $5, and
the cost of the 251st unit (marginal cost) is only about $4. As long as marginal revenue is
greater than marginal cost, even though the difference between the two is getting smaller,
added output means added profit. Whenever marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, the
revenue gained by increasing output by 1 unit per period exceeds the cost incurred by doing
so. This logic leads us to 300 units of output. At 300 units, marginal cost has risen to $5. At
300 units of output, P* = MR = MC = $5.
Notice that if the firm were to produce more than 300 units, marginal cost would rise above
marginal revenue.At 340 units of output, for example, the cost of the 341st unit is about $5.70 while
that added unit of output still brings in only $5 in revenue, thus reducing profit. It simply does not
pay to increase output above the point where marginal cost rises above marginal revenue because
such increases will reduce profit. The profit-maximizing perfectly competitive firm will produce up
to the point where the price of its output is just equal to short-run marginal cost—the level of out-
put at which P* = MC. Thus, in Figure 8.10, the profit-maximizing level of output, q*, is 300 units.
Keep in mind, though, that all types of firms (not just those in perfectly competitive indus-
tries) are profit maximizers. The profit-maximizing output level for all firms is the output level
where MR = MC. In perfect competition, however, MR = P, as shown earlier. Hence, for perfectly
competitive firms, we can rewrite our profit-maximizing condition as P = MC.
Important note: The key idea here is that firms will produce as long as marginal revenue exceeds
marginal cost. When marginal cost rises smoothly, as it does in Figure 8.10, the profit-maximizing
condition is that MR (or P) exactly equals MC. If marginal cost moves up in increments—as it
does in the following numerical example—marginal revenue or price may never exactly equal
marginal cost. The key idea still holds.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Case Study in Marginal Analysis: An Ice Cream Parlor
The following is a description of the decisions made in 2000 by the
owner of a small ice cream parlor in Ohio. After being in business
for 1 year, this entrepreneur had to ask herself whether she should
stay in business.
The cost figures on which she based her decisions are pre-
sented next. These numbers are real, but they do not include one
important item: the managerial labor provided by the owner. In
her calculations, the entrepreneur did not include a wage for her-
self, but we will assume an opportunity cost of $30,000 per year
($2,500 per month).
FIXED COSTS
The fixed components of the store’s monthly costs include the following:
Rent (1,150 square feet)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$2,012.50
Electricity  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .325.00
Interest on loan  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .737.50
Maintenance  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .295.00
Telephone  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
65.00
Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$3,435.00
Not all the items on this list are strictly fixed, however. Electricity
costs, for example, would be slightly higher if the store produced
more ice cream and stayed open longer, but the added cost would
be minimal.
VARIABLE COSTS
The ice cream store’s variable costs include two components:
(1) behind-the-counter labor costs and (2) cost of making ice cream.
The store hires employees at a wage of $5.15 per hour. Including the
employer’s share of the Social Security tax, the gross cost of labor is
$5.54 per hour. Two employees work in the store at all times. The full
cost of producing ice cream is $3.27 per gallon. Each gallon contains
approximately 12 servings. Customers can add toppings free of
charge, and the average cost of the toppings taken by a customer is
about $.05:
Gross labor costs  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$5.54/hour
Costs of producing one gallon of
ice cream (12 servings per gallon)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$3.27
Average cost of added toppings per serving  . . . . . . . . . . . .$.05
REVENUES
The store sells ice cream cones, sundaes, and floats. The average
price of a purchase at the store is $1.45. The store is open 8 hours
per day, 26 days a month, and serves an average of 240 customers
per day:
Average purchase . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$1.45
Days open per month  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .26
Average number of customers per day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .240
From the preceding information, it is possible to calculate the
store’s average monthly profit. Total revenue is equal to 240 cus-
tomers  $1.45 per customer  26 days open in an average month:
TR = $9,048 per month.
PROFITS
The store sells 240 servings per day. Because there are 12 servings
of ice cream per gallon, the store uses exactly 20 gallons per day
(240 servings divided by 12). Total costs are $3.27  20, or $65.40,
per day for ice cream and $12 per day for toppings (240  $.05).
The cost of variable labor is $5.54  8 hours  2 workers, or
$88.64 per day. Total variable costs are therefore $166.04 ($65.40 +
$12.00 + $88.64) per day. The store is open 26 days a month, so
the total variable cost per month is $4,317.04.
Adding fixed costs of $3,435.00 to variable costs of $4,317.04,
we get a total cost of operation of $7,752.04 per month. Thus, the
firm is averaging a profit of $1,295.96 per month ($9,048.00 –
$7,752.04). This is not an “economic profit” because we have not
accounted for the opportunity cost of the owner’s time and efforts. In
fact, when we factor in an implicit wage of $2,500 per month for
the owner, we see that the store is suffering losses of $1,204.04 per
month ($1,295.96 – $2,500.00).

Should the entrepreneur stay in business? If she wants to make
$2,500 per month and she thinks that nothing about her business
will change, she must shut down in the long run. However, two
things keep her going: (1) a decision to stay open longer and (2) the
hope for more customers in the future.
OPENING LONGER HOURS: MARGINAL COSTS AND
MARGINAL REVENUES
The store’s normal hours of operation are noon until 8 P.M. On an
experimental basis, the owner extends its hours until 11 P.M. for 
1 month. The following table shows the average number of addi-
tional customers for each of the added hours:

Labor: 2  $5.54  =  11.08
Total    $13.64
–$2.04
Assuming that the late customers spend an average of $1.45, we
can calculate the marginal revenue and the marginal cost of staying
open longer. The marginal cost of one serving of ice cream is $3.27
divided by 12 = $0.27 + .05 (for topping) = $0.32. (See the table
that follows.)
Marginal analysis tells us that the store should stay open for 
2 additional hours. Each day that the store stays open from 8 P.M.
to 9 P.M. it will make an added profit of $59.45 – $24.20, or $35.25.
Staying open from 9 P.M. to 10 P.M. adds $29.00 – $17.48, or
$11.52, to profit. Staying open the third hour, however, decreases
profits because the marginal revenue generated by staying open
from 10 P.M. to 11 P.M. is less than the marginal cost. The entre-
preneur decides to stay open for 2 additional hours per day.
This adds $46.77 ($35.25 + 11.52) to profits each day, a total of
$1,216.02 per month.
By adding the 2 hours, the store turns an economic loss of
$1,204.04 per month into a small ($11.98) profit after accounting
for the owner’s implicit wage of $2,500 per month.
The owner decided to stay in business. She now serves over
350 customers per day, and the price of a dish of ice cream has risen
to $2.50 while costs have not changed very much. In 2001, she
cleared a profit of nearly $10,000 per month.

A Numerical Example
Table 8.6 presents some data for another hypothetical firm. Let us
assume that the market has set a $15 unit price for the firm’s product. Total revenue in column 6
is the simple product of P  q (the numbers in column 1 times $15). The table derives total, mar-
ginal, and average costs exactly as Table 8.4 did. Here, however, we have included revenues, and
we can calculate the profit, which is shown in column 8.
Column 8 shows that a profit-maximizing firm would choose to produce 4 units of output.
At this level, profits are $20. At all other output levels, they are lower. Now let us see if “marginal”
reasoning leads us to the same conclusion.
First, should the firm produce at all? If it produces nothing, it suffers losses equal to $10. If it
increases output to 1 unit, marginal revenue is $15 (remember that it sells each unit for $15) and
marginal cost is $10. Thus, it gains $5, reducing its loss from $10 each period to $5.
Should the firm increase output to 2 units? The marginal revenue from the second unit is
again $15, but the marginal cost is only $5. Thus, by producing the second unit, the firm gains
$10 ($15 – $5) and turns a $5 loss into a $5 profit. The third unit adds $10 to profits. Again, mar-
ginal revenue is $15 and marginal cost is $5, an increase in profit of $10, for a total profit of $15.

184
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
The fourth unit offers still more profit. Price is still above marginal cost, which means that
producing that fourth unit will increase profits. Price, or marginal revenue, is $15, and marginal
cost is just $10. Thus, the fourth unit adds $5 to profit. At unit number five, however, diminishing
returns push marginal cost above price. The marginal revenue from producing the fifth unit is
$15, while marginal cost is now $20. As a result, profit per period drops by $5, to $15 per period.
Clearly, the firm will not produce the fifth unit.
The profit-maximizing level of output is thus 4 units. The firm produces as long as price
(marginal revenue) is greater than marginal cost. For an in-depth example of profit maximiza-
tion, see “Case Study in Marginal Analysis: An Ice Cream Parlor” on p. 182.
The Short-Run Supply Curve
Consider how the typical firm shown in Figure 8.10 on p. 181 would behave in response to an
increase in price. In Figure 8.11(a), assume that something causes demand to increase (shift to
the right), driving price from $5 to $6 and finally to $7. When price is $5, a profit-maximizing
firm will choose an output level of 300 in Figure 8.11(b). To produce any less, or to raise out-
put above that level, would lead to a lower level of profit. At $6, the same firm would increase
output to 350, but it would stop there. Similarly, at $7, the firm would raise output to 400 units
of output.
The MC curve in Figure 8.11(b) relates price and quantity supplied. At any market price, the
marginal cost curve shows the output level that maximizes profit. A curve that shows how much
output a profit-maximizing firm will produce at every price also fits the definition of a supply
curve. (Review Chapter 3 if this point is not clear to you.) Thus, the marginal cost curve of a com-
petitive firm is the firm’s short-run supply curve.
As you will see, one very important exception exists to this general rule: There is some price
level below which the firm will shut down its operations and simply bear losses equal to fixed
costs even if price is above marginal cost. This important point is discussed in Chapter 9.

 FIGURE 8.11 Marginal Cost Is the Supply Curve of a Perfectly Competitive Firm
At any market price,a the marginal cost curve shows the output level that maximizes profit. Thus, the mar-
ginal cost curve of a perfectly competitive profit-maximizing firm is the firm’s short-run supply curve.
a This is true except when price is so low that it pays a firm to shut down—a point that will be discussed in Chapter 9.

CHAPTER 8
Short-Run Costs and Output Decisions 185
Looking Ahead
At the beginning of this chapter, we set out to combine information on technology, factor prices,
and output prices to understand the supply curve of a competitive firm. We have now accom-
plished that goal.
Because marginal cost is such an important concept in microeconomics, you should care-
fully review any sections of this chapter that were unclear to you. Above all, keep in mind that
the marginal cost curve carries information about both input prices and technology. The firm
looks to output markets for information on potential revenues, and the current market price
defines the firm’s marginal revenue curve. The point where price (which is equal to marginal
revenue in perfect competition) is just equal to marginal cost is the perfectly competitive firm’s
profit-maximizing level of output. Thus, with one important exception, the marginal cost curve
is the perfectly competitive firm’s supply curve in the short run.
In the next chapter, we turn to the long run. What happens when firms are free to choose their
scale of operations without being limited by a fixed factor of production? Without diminishing
returns that set in as a result of a fixed scale of production, what determines the shape of cost curves?
What happens when new firms can enter industries in which profits are being earned? How do indus-
tries adjust when losses are being incurred? How does the structure of an industry evolve over time?
S U M M A R Y
1. Profit-maximizing firms make decisions to maximize profit
(total revenue minus total cost).
2. To calculate production costs, firms must know two things:
(1) the quantity and combination of inputs they need to
produce their product and (2) the cost of those inputs.
COSTS IN THE SHORT RUN p. 168
3. Fixed costs are costs that do not change with a firm’s output.
In the short run, firms cannot avoid fixed costs or change
them even if production is zero.
4. Variable costs are those costs that depend on the level of out-
put chosen. Fixed costs plus variable costs equal total costs
(TC = TFC + TVC).
5. Average fixed cost (AFC) is total fixed cost divided by the
quantity of output. As output rises, average fixed cost
declines steadily because the same total is being spread over
a larger and larger quantity of output. This phenomenon is
called spreading overhead.
6. Numerous combinations of inputs can be used to produce a
given level of output. Total variable cost (TVC) is the sum of
all costs that vary with output in the short run.
7. Marginal cost (MC) is the increase in total cost that results
from the production of 1 more unit of output. If a firm is pro-
ducing 1,000 units, the additional cost of increasing output to
1,001 units is marginal cost. Marginal cost measures the cost
of the additional inputs required to produce each successive
unit of output. Because fixed costs do not change when out-
put changes, marginal costs reflect changes in variable costs.
8. In the short run, a firm is limited by a fixed factor of pro-
duction or a fixed scale of a plant. As a firm increases output,
it will eventually find itself trapped by that scale. Because of
the fixed scale, marginal cost eventually rises with output.
9. Marginal cost is the slope of the total variable cost curve.
The total variable cost curve always has a positive slope
because total costs always rise with output. However,
increasing marginal cost means that total costs ultimately
rise at an increasing rate.
10. Average variable cost (AVC) is equal to total variable cost
divided by the quantity of output.
11. When marginal cost is above average variable cost, average
variable cost is increasing. When marginal cost is below aver-
age variable cost, average variable cost is declining. Marginal
cost intersects average variable cost at AVC’s minimum point.
12. Average total cost (ATC) is equal to total cost divided by the
quantity of output. It is also equal to the sum of average
fixed cost and average variable cost.
13. When marginal cost is below average total cost, average total
cost is declining toward marginal cost. When marginal cost
is above average total cost, average total cost is increasing.
Marginal cost intersects average total cost at ATC’s mini-
mum point.
OUTPUT DECISIONS: REVENUES, COSTS, AND
PROFIT MAXIMIZATION p. 179
14. A perfectly competitive firm faces a demand curve that is a
horizontal line (in other words, perfectly elastic demand).
15. Total revenue (TR) is simply price times the quantity of out-
put that a firm decides to produce and sell. Marginal revenue
(MR) is the additional revenue that a firm takes in when it
increases output by 1 unit.
16. For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue is equal
to the current market price of its product.
17. A profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive industry
will produce up to the point at which the price of its output
is just equal to short-run marginal cost: P = MC. The more
general profit-maximizing formula is MR = MC (P = MR in
perfect competition). The marginal cost curve of a perfectly
competitive firm is the firm’s short-run supply curve, with
one exception (discussed in Chapter 9).

1. Consider the following costs of owning and operating a car. A
$25,000 Ford Taurus financed over 60 months at 7 percent inter-
est means a monthly payment of $495.03. Insurance costs $100 a
month regardless of how much you drive. The car gets 20 miles
per gallon and uses unleaded regular gasoline that costs $3.50 per
gallon. Finally, suppose that wear and tear on the car costs about
15 cents a mile. Which costs are fixed, and which are variable?
What is the marginal cost of a mile driven? In deciding whether

2. July 23, 2007 LONDON (Reuters)—The final volume of the Harry
Potter saga sold more than 11 million copies in the first 24 hours it
went on sale in the United States and Britain to become the fastest-
selling book in history, publishers said. In book publishing, fixed
costs are very high and marginal costs are very low and fairly con-
stant. Suppose that the fixed cost of producing the new Harry Potter
volume is $30 million.What is the average fixed cost if the publisher
produces 5 million copies? 10 million copies? 20 million copies?
Now suppose that the marginal cost of a Harry Potter book is
$1.50 per book and is the same for each book up to 40 million
copies. Assume that this includes all variable costs. Explain why in
this case marginal cost is a horizontal line, as is average variable
cost. What is the average total cost of the book if the publisher
produces 5 million copies? 10 million copies? 20 million copies?
Sketch the average fixed cost curve and the average total cost
curve facing the publisher.
3. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Firms minimize
costs; thus, a firm earning short-run economic profits will choose
to produce at the minimum point on its average total cost function.
4. You are given the following cost data:
Total fixed costs are 100.

12. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 182] Elena and
Emmanuel live on the Black Sea in Bulgaria and own a small
fishing boat. A crew of four is required to take the boat out fish-
ing. The current wage paid to the four crew members is a total
of 5,000 levs per day. (A lev is the Bulgarian unit of currency.)
Assume that the cost of operating and maintaining the boat is
1,000 levs per day when fishing and zero otherwise. The follow-

Long-Run Costs and
Output Decisions
The last two chapters discussed the
behavior of profit-maximizing competi-
tive firms in the short run. Recall that all
firms must make three fundamental
decisions: (1) how much output to pro-
duce or supply, (2) how to produce that
output,and (3) how much of each input
to demand.
Firms use information on input
prices, output prices, and technology to
make the decisions that will lead to the
most profit. Because profits equal rev-
enues minus costs, firms must know
how much their products will sell for
and how much production will cost, using the most efficient technology.
In Chapter 8, we saw how cost curves can be derived from production functions and input
prices. Once a firm has a clear picture of its short-run costs, the price at which it sells its output
determines the quantity of output that will maximize profit. Specifically, a profit-maximizing
perfectly competitive firm will supply output up to the point that price (marginal revenue) equals
marginal cost. The marginal cost curve of such a firm is thus the same as its supply curve.
In this chapter, we turn from the short run to the long run. The condition in which firms find
themselves in the short run (Are they making profits? Are they incurring losses?) determines what is
likely to happen in the long run. Remember that output (supply) decisions in the long run are less
constrained than in the short run, for two reasons. First, in the long run, the firm can increase any
or all of its inputs and thus has no fixed factor of production that confines its production to a given
scale. Second, firms are free to enter industries to seek profits and to leave industries to avoid losses.
In thinking about the relationship between the short run and long run, it is useful to put
yourself in the position of a manager of a firm. At times, you will be making what we term short-
run decisions: You are stuck with a particular factory and set of machines, and your decisions
involve asking how best to use those assets to produce output. At the same time, you or another
manager at the firm will be doing more strategic long-run thinking: Should you be in this busi-
ness at all, or should you close up shop? In better times, you might consider expanding the oper-
ation. In thinking about the long run, you will also have to reckon with other firms entering and
exiting the industry. Managers simultaneously make short- and long-run decisions, making the
best of the current constraints while planning for the future.
In making decisions or understanding industry structure, the shape of the long-run cost
curve is important. As we saw in the short run, a fixed factor of production eventually causes
marginal cost to increase along with output. In the long run, all factors can be varied. In the ear-
lier sandwich shop example, in the long run, we can add floor space and grills along with more
people to make the sandwiches. Under these circumstances, it is no longer inevitable that
increased volume comes with higher costs. In fact, as we will see, long-run cost curves need not
slope up at all. You might have wondered why there are only a few automobile and steel compa-
nies in the United States but dozens of firms producing books and furniture. Differences in the
shapes of the long-run cost curves in those industries do a good job of explaining these differ-
ences in the industry structures.

190
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
We begin our discussion of the long run by looking at firms in three short-run circum-
stances: (1) firms that earn economic profits, (2) firms that suffer economic losses but continue
to operate to reduce or minimize those losses, and (3) firms that decide to shut down and bear
losses just equal to fixed costs. We then examine how these firms make their long-run decisions in
response to conditions in their markets.
Although we continue to focus on perfectly competitive firms, all firms are subject to the
spectrum of short-run profit or loss situations regardless of market structure. Assuming perfect
competition allows us to simplify our analysis and provides us with a strong background for
understanding the discussions of imperfectly competitive behavior in later chapters.
Short-Run Conditions and Long-Run
Directions
Before beginning our examination of firm behavior, let us review the concept of profit. Recall
that a normal rate of return is included in the definition of total cost (Chapter 7). A normal rate
of return is a rate that is just sufficient to keep current investors interested in the industry.
Because we define profit as total revenue minus total cost and because total cost includes a nor-
mal rate of return, our concept of profit takes into account the opportunity cost of capital. When
a firm is earning an above-normal rate of return, it has a positive profit level; otherwise, it does
not. When there are positive profits in an industry, new investors are likely to be attracted to
the industry.
When we say that a firm is suffering a loss, we mean that it is earning a rate of return that is
below normal. Such a firm may be suffering a loss as an accountant would measure it, or it may
be earning at a very low—that is, below normal—rate. Investors are not going to be attracted to
an industry in which there are losses. A firm that is breaking even, or earning a zero level of
profit, is one that is earning exactly a normal rate of return. New investors are not attracted, but
current ones are not running away either.
With these distinctions in mind, we can say that for any firm, one of three conditions holds
at any given moment: (1) The firm is making positive profits, (2) the firm is suffering losses, or
(3) the firm is just breaking even. Profitable firms will want to maximize their profits in the short
run, while firms suffering losses will want to minimize those losses in the short run.
Maximizing Profits
The best way to understand the behavior of a firm that is currently earning profits is by way 
of example.
Example: The Blue Velvet Car Wash
When a firm earns revenues in excess of costs
(including a normal rate of return), we say it is earning positive or excess profits. Let us consider
as an example the Blue Velvet Car Wash. Looking at a few numbers will help you see how the
specifics of a business operation translate into economic graphs.
Car washes require a facility. In the case of Blue Velvet, suppose investors have put up $500,000 to
construct a building and purchase all the equipment required to wash cars. If the car wash closes, the
building and equipment can be sold for its original purchase price, but as long as the firm is in busi-
ness, that capital is tied up. If the investors could get 10 percent return on their investment in another
business,then for them to keep their money in this business,they will also expect 10 percent from Blue
Velvet.Thus,the annual cost of the capital needed for the business is $50,000 (10 percent of $500,000).
The car wash is currently servicing 800 cars a week and can be open 50 weeks a year (2 weeks are
needed for maintenance). The cost of the basic maintenance contract on the equipment is $50,000
per year, and Blue Velvet has a contract to pay for those services for a year whether it opens the car
wash or not. The fixed costs then for the car wash are $100,000 per year: $50,000 for the capital costs
and $50,000 for the equipment contract. On a weekly basis, these costs amount to $2,000 per week. If
the car wash operates at the level of 800 cars per week, fixed costs are $2.50 per car ($2,000/800).
There are also variable costs associated with the business. To run a car wash, one needs work-
ers and soap and water. Workers can be hired by the hour for $10.00 an hour, and at a customer
level of 800 cars per week, each worker can wash 8 cars an hour. At this service level, then, Blue
Velvet hires workers for 100 hours and has a wage bill of $1,000. The labor cost of each car wash,
when Blue Velvet serves 800 customers, is $1.25 ($10/8).

in which a firm is earning

CHAPTER 9
Long-Run Costs and Output Decisions 191
The number of cars each worker can service depends on the number of cars being worked
on. When there is too little business and few workers, no specialization is possible and cars
washed per worker fall. With many cars to service, workers start getting in one another’s way. We
saw that at 800 cars per week, workers could wash 8 each per hour. Later when we graph the oper-
ation, we will assume that the number of cars washed per worker rises and then falls, reaching a
maximum at a volume less than the current 800 cars.
Every car that is washed costs $0.75 in soap, adding $600 to the weekly bill if 800 car washes
are done. Table 9.1 summarizes the costs of Blue Velvet at the 800 washes per week level.
This car wash business is quite competitive, and the market price for this service at the
moment we are considering is $5. (Recall the perfectly elastic demand curve facing a competitive
firm we discussed in Chapter 8.) At a service level of 800 cars, as you see from the table, Blue Velvet
is making a positive profit of $400 per week. For each car washed, it receives $5 and spends $4.50
($2.50 in fixed costs + $1.25 in labor costs + $0.75 in soap), for an excess profit of $0.50 per car.
Graphic Presentation
For Blue Velvet, we have seen a snapshot of the business as it oper-
ates with 800 cars serviced a week. We have also learned a little about the business, which we can
use to construct a graphical representation of Blue Velvet to help us see why the firm chose to ser-
vice 800 cars. Figure 9.1 graphs the performance of Blue Velvet in this first period in which it is
making money.

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
The industry price is $5.00, and we have assumed that the total number of car washes done in
the market area in a week is 8,000; so there are 10 firms like Blue Velvet in this competitive market-
place all earning economic profits. There are three key cost curves shown in the graph that repre-
sents Blue Velvet. The average variable cost (AVC) curve shows what happens to the per unit costs
of workers and the other variable factor, soap, as we change output. Initially as output increases
workers can service more cars per hour as they work together, thus causing the AVC to decline, but
eventually diminishing returns set in and AVC begins to rise. Now look at the average total cost
(ATC) curve. The average total cost curve falls at first in response to the spreading of the fixed costs
over more and more units and eventually begins to rise as the inefficiencies in labor take their toll.
At the output of 800 washes, the ATC has a value of $4.50. Look back at Table 9.1. The total cost of
Blue Velvet at a service level of 800 cars is $3,600. The $4.50 comes from dividing this $3,600 by
800 cars. Finally, we see the marginal cost (MC) curve, which rises after a certain point because of
the fixed factor of the building and equipment.
With a price of $5.00, Blue Velvet is producing 800 units and making a profit (the gray box).
Blue Velvet is a perfectly competitive firm, and it maximizes profits by producing up to the point
where price equals marginal cost, here 800 car washes. Any units produced beyond 800 would
add more to cost than they would bring in revenue. Notice Blue Velvet is producing at a level that
is larger than the output that minimizes average costs. The high price in the marketplace has
induced Blue Velvet to increase its service level even though the result is slightly less labor pro-
ductivity and thus higher per unit costs.
Both revenues and costs are shown graphically. Total revenue (TR) is simply the product of
price and quantity: P*  q* = $5  800 = $4,000. On the diagram, total revenue is equal to the
area of the rectangle P*Aq*0. (The area of a rectangle is equal to its length times its width.) At
output q*, average total cost is $4.50 (point B). Numerically, it is equal to the length of line seg-
ment q*B. Because average total cost is derived by dividing total cost by q, we can get back to total
cost by multiplying average total cost by q. That is,
and so
TC = ATC  q
Total cost (TC), then, is $4.50  800 = $3,600, the area shaded blue in the diagram. Profit is sim-
ply the difference between total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC), or $400. This is the area that is
shaded gray in the diagram. This firm is earning positive profits.
A firm, like Blue Velvet, that is earning a positive profit in the short run and expects to con-
tinue doing so has an incentive to expand its scale of operation in the long run. Managers in these
firms will likely be planning to expand even as they concentrate on producing 800 units. We
expect greater output to be produced in the long run as firms react to profits they are earning.
Minimizing Losses
A firm that is not earning a positive profit or breaking even is suffering a loss. Firms suffering
losses fall into two categories: (1) those that find it advantageous to shut down operations
immediately and bear losses equal to total fixed costs and (2) those that continue to operate in
the short run to minimize their losses. The most important thing to remember here is that firms
cannot exit the industry in the short run. The firm can shut down, but it cannot get rid of its
fixed costs by going out of business. Fixed costs must be paid in the short run no matter what
the firm does.
Whether a firm suffering losses decides to produce or not to produce in the short run
depends on the advantages and disadvantages of continuing production. If a firm shuts down, it
earns no revenue and has no variable costs to bear. If it continues to produce, it both earns rev-
enue and incurs variable costs. Because a firm must bear fixed costs whether or not it shuts down,
its decision depends solely on whether total revenue from operating is sufficient to cover total
variable cost.
ATC = TC
q

CHAPTER 9
Long-Run Costs and Output Decisions 193
 If total revenue exceeds total variable cost, the excess revenue can be used to
offset fixed costs and reduce losses, and it will pay the firm to keep operating.
 If total revenue is smaller than total variable cost, the firm that operates will suf-
fer losses in excess of fixed costs. In this case, the firm can minimize its losses by
shutting down.
Producing at a Loss to Offset Fixed Costs: Blue Velvet Revisited
Suppose con-
sumers suddenly decide that car washing is a waste of money and demand falls. The price begins to
fall, and Blue Velvet is no longer so profitable.We can see what Blue Velvet’s management will decide
to do by looking back at Figure 9.1. With an upward-sloping marginal cost curve, as price begins to
fall, the Blue Velvet management team first will choose to reduce the number of cars it services. As
long as the price is greater than ATC (which is minimized at about $4.35 on the graph), Blue Velvet
continues to make a profit. What happens if the price falls below this level, say to $3 per car?
Now Blue Velvet has to decide not only how many cars to wash but whether to be open at all.
If the car wash closes, there are no labor and soap costs. But Blue Velvet still has to pay for its
unbreakable year-long contract, and it still owns its building, which will take some time to sell. So
the fixed costs of $2,000 per week remain. For Blue Velvet, the key question is can it do better than
losing $2,000? The answer depends on whether the market price is greater or less than average
variable costs—the costs per unit for the variable factors. If the price is greater than the average
variable cost, then Blue Velvet can pay for its workers and the soap and have something left for the
investors. It will still lose money, but it will be less than $2,000. If price is less than average vari-
able cost, the firm will not only lose its $2,000 but also have added losses on every car it washes.
So the simple answer for Blue Velvet is that it should stay open and wash cars as long as it covers
its variable costs. Economists call this the shutdown point. At all prices above this shutdown
point, the marginal cost curve shows the profit-maximizing level of output. At all points below
this point, optimal short-run output is zero.
We can now refine our earlier statement, from Chapter 8, that a perfectly competitive firm’s
marginal cost curve is its short-run supply curve. As we have just seen, a firm will shut down
when the market price is less than the minimum point on the AVC curve. Also recall (or notice
from the graph) that the marginal cost curve intersects the AVC at AVC’s lowest point. It therefore
follows that the short-run supply curve of a competitive firm is that portion of its marginal cost
curve that lies above its average variable cost curve. For Blue Velvet, the firm will shut down at a
price of about $1.50 (reading off the graph).
Figure 9.2 shows the short-run supply curve for the general case of a perfectly competitive
firm like Blue Velvet.

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
The Short-Run Industry Supply Curve
Supply in a competitive industry is the sum of the quantity supplied by the individual firms in the
industry at each price level. The short-run industry supply curve is the sum of the individual
firm supply curves—that is, the marginal cost curves (above AVC) of all the firms in the industry.
Because quantities are being added—that is, because we are finding the total quantity supplied in
the industry at each price level—the curves are added horizontally.
Figure 9.3 shows the supply curve for an industry with three identical firms.1 At a price of $6,
each firm produces 150 units, which is the output where P = MC. The total amount supplied on
the market at a price of $6 is thus 450.At a price of $5, each firm produces 120 units, for an indus-
try supply of 360. Below $4.50, all firms shut down; P is less than AVC.
Two things can cause the industry supply curve to shift. In the short run, the industry supply
curve shifts if something—a decrease in the price of some input, for instance—shifts the marginal
cost curves of all the individual firms simultaneously. For example, when the cost of producing
components of home computers decreased, the marginal cost curves of all computer manufactur-
ers shifted downward. Such a shift amounted to the same thing as an outward shift in their supply
curves. Each firm was willing to supply more computers at each price level because computers
were now cheaper to produce.
In the long run, an increase or decrease in the number of firms—and, therefore, in the num-
ber of individual firm supply curves—shifts the total industry supply curve. If new firms enter
the industry, the industry supply curve moves to the right; if firms exit the industry, the industry
supply curve moves to the left.
We return to shifts in industry supply curves and discuss them further when we take up
long-run adjustments later in this chapter.
Long-Run Directions: A Review
Table 9.2 summarizes the different circumstances that perfectly competitive firms may face as
they plan for the long run. Profit-making firms will produce up to the point where price and
marginal cost are equal in the short run. If there are positive profits, in the long run, there is an
incentive for firms to expand their scales of plant and for new firms to enter the industry.

CHAPTER 9
Long-Run Costs and Output Decisions 195
A firm suffering losses will produce if and only if revenue is sufficient to cover total variable
cost. Such firms, like profitable firms, will also produce up to the point where P = MC. If a firm
suffering losses cannot cover total variable cost by operating, it will shut down and bear losses
equal to total fixed cost. Whether a firm that is suffering losses decides to shut down in the short
run or not, the losses create an incentive to contract in the long run. When firms are suffering
losses, they generally exit the industry in the long run.
Thus, the short-run profits of firms cause them to expand or contract when opportuni-
ties exist to change their scale of plant. If expansion is desired because economic profits are
positive, firms must consider what their costs are likely to be at different scales or operation.
(When we use the term “scale of operation,” you may find it helpful to picture factories of
varying sizes.) Just as firms have to analyze different technologies to arrive at a cost structure
in the short run, they must also compare their costs at different scales of plant to arrive at
long-run costs. Perhaps a larger scale of operations will reduce average production costs and
provide an even greater incentive for a profit-making firm to expand, or perhaps large firms
will run into problems that constrain growth. The analysis of long-run possibilities is even
more complex than the short-run analysis because more things are variable—scale of plant is
not fixed, for example, and there are no fixed costs because firms can exit their industry in the
long run. In theory, firms may choose any scale of operation; so they must analyze many pos-
sible options.
Now let us turn to an analysis of cost curves in the long run.
Long-Run Costs: Economies and
Diseconomies of Scale
The shapes of short-run cost curves follow directly from the assumption of a fixed factor of
production. As output increases beyond a certain point, the fixed factor (which we usually
think of as fixed scale of plant) causes diminishing returns to other factors and thus increas-
ing marginal costs. In the long run, however, there is no fixed factor of production.
Firms can choose any scale of production. They can build small or large factories, double or
triple output, or go out of business completely.
The shape of a firm’s long-run average cost curve shows how costs vary with scale of opera-
tions. In some firms, production technology is such that increased scale, or size, reduces costs. For
others, increased scale leads to higher per-unit costs.When an increase in a firm’s scale of produc-
tion leads to lower average costs, we say that there are increasing returns to scale, or economies
of scale. When average costs do not change with the scale of production, we say that there are
constant returns to scale. Finally, when an increase in a firm’s scale of production leads to
higher average costs, we say that there are decreasing returns to scale, or diseconomies of
scale. Because these economies of scale are a property of production characteristics of the indi-
vidual firm, they are considered internal economies of scale. In the Appendix to this chapter, we
talk about external economies of scale, which describe economies or diseconomies of scale on an
industry-wide basis.

Increasing Returns to Scale
Technically, the phrase increasing returns to scale refers to the relationship between inputs and out-
puts. When we say that a production function exhibits increasing returns, we mean that a given
percentage of increase in inputs leads to a larger percentage of increase in the production of out-
put. For example, if a firm doubled or tripled inputs, it would more than double or triple output.
When firms can count on fixed input prices—that is, when the prices of inputs do not
change with output levels—increasing returns to scale also means that as output rises, average
cost of production falls. The term economies of scale refers directly to this reduction in cost per
unit of output that follows from larger-scale production.
The Sources of Economies of Scale
Most of the economies of scale that immediately
come to mind are technological in nature. Automobile production, for example, would be more
costly per unit if a firm were to produce 100 cars per year by hand. In the early 1900s, Henry
Ford introduced standardized production techniques that increased output volume, reduced
costs per car, and made the automobile available to almost everyone. The new technology is not
very cost-effective at small volumes of cars, but at larger volumes costs are greatly reduced.
Ford’s innovation provided a source of scale economics at the plant level of the auto firm.
Some economies of scale result not from technology but from firm-level efficiencies and bar-
gaining power that can come with size.Very large companies, for instance, can buy inputs in volume
at discounted prices. Large firms may also produce some of their own inputs at considerable sav-
ings, and they can certainly save in transport costs when they ship items in bulk. Wal-Mart has
become the largest retailer in the United States in part because of scale economies of this type.
Economics of scale have come from advantages of larger firm size rather than gains from plant size.
Economies of scale can be seen all around us. A bus that carries 50 people between
Vancouver and Seattle uses less labor, capital, and gasoline than 50 people driving 50 different
automobiles. The cost per passenger (average cost) is lower on the bus. Roommates who share an
apartment are taking advantage of economies of scale. Costs per person for heat, electricity, and
space are lower when an apartment is shared than if each person rents a separate apartment.
Example: Economies of Scale in Egg Production
Nowhere are economies of scale
more visible than in agriculture. Consider the following example. A few years ago a major
agribusiness moved to a small Ohio town and set up a huge egg-producing operation. The new
firm, Chicken Little Egg Farms Inc., is completely mechanized. Complex machines feed the chick-
ens and collect and box the eggs. Large refrigerated trucks transport the eggs all over the state daily.
In the same town, some small farmers still own fewer than 200 chickens. These farmers collect the
eggs, feed the chickens, clean the coops by hand, and deliver the eggs to county markets.
Table 9.3 presents some hypothetical cost data for Homer Jones’s small operation and for
Chicken Little Inc. Jones has his operation working well. He has several hundred chickens and

spends about 15 hours per week feeding, collecting, delivering, and so on. During the rest of his
time, he raises soybeans. We can value Jones’s time at $8 per hour because that is the wage he
could earn working at a local manufacturing plant. When we add up all Jones’s costs, including a
rough estimate of the land and capital costs attributable to egg production, we arrive at $177 per
week. Total production on the Jones farm runs about 200 dozen, or 2,400, eggs per week, which
means that Jones’s average cost comes out to $0.074 per egg.
The costs of Chicken Little Inc. are much higher in total; weekly costs run over $30,000. A
much higher percentage of costs are capital costs—the firm uses a great many pieces of sophisti-
cated machinery that cost millions to put in place. Total output is 1.6 million eggs per week, and
the product is shipped all over the Midwest. The comparatively huge scale of plant has driven
average production costs all the way down to $0.019 per egg.
Although these numbers are hypothetical, you can see why small farmers in the United States
are finding it difficult to compete with large-scale agribusiness concerns that can realize signifi-
cant economies of scale.
Many large firms have multiple plants or sites where they produce their goods and services.
In our discussion in this chapter, we will distinguish between cost changes that come about
because a firm decides to build a large versus a small plant and cost changes that result from firms
adding volume to their production by building more plants. Coors originally produced its beer in
Colorado in what was, at the time, one of the largest U.S. brewing plants; the firm believed that
large size at the plant level brought cost savings. Most electronics companies, on the other hand,
produce their output in multiple moderate-sized plants and hope to achieve cost savings through
firm size. Both sources of scale economies are important in the economy.
Graphic Presentation
A firm’s long-run average cost curve (LRAC) shows the differ-
ent scales at which it can choose to operate in the long run. A given point on the LRAC tells us
the average cost of producing the associated level of output. At that point, the existing scale of
plant determines the position and shape of the firm’s short-run cost curves. The long-run aver-
age cost curve shows the positions of the different sets of short-run curves among which the
firm must choose. In making the long-run strategic choice of plant scale, the firm then
confronts an associated set of short-run cost curves. The long-run average cost curve is the
“envelope” of a series of short-run curves; it “wraps around” the set of all possible short-run
curves like an envelope.
When the firm experiences economies of scale, its LRAC will decline with output. Figure 9.4
shows short-run and long-run average cost curves for a firm that realizes economies of scale up to
about 100,000 units of production and roughly constant returns to scale after that. The 100,000 unit
output level in Figure 9.4 is sometimes called the minimum efficient scale (MES) of the firm. The
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Economies of Scale in the World Marketplace
In this chapter we describe a range of possible long-run cost curves.
The form of the long-run production function and possible exis-
tence of economies of scale in production have much to say about
industrial structure in ways we will explore further in a later chapter.
In a world economy in which trade occurs across geographical
boundaries, if economies of scale exist, it is possible to exploit those
economies across a very large output base. The 2009 World
Development Report from the World Bank has an interesting chap-
ter on scale economies with a few fascinating examples from around
the world.
Dongguan is a major manufacturing city in Southeast China,
lying between Guangzhou and Shenzhen. A single plant in
Dongguan produces more than 30 percent of the world’s magnetic
recording heads used in hard disk drives. Another plant in the same
city produces 60 percent of the electronic learning devices sold in
the United States, while a third plant produces 30 million mobile
phones, again all in one plant. Clearly, the scale economies in these
three sectors must be very large indeed. Notice in the case of all three
examples that products are also light and easy to ship.

MES is the smallest size at which the long-run average cost curve is at its minimum. Essentially, it is
the answer to the question, how large does a firm have to be to have the best per-unit cost position
possible? Consider a firm operating in an industry in which all of the firms in that industry face the
long-run average cost curve shown in Figure 9.4. If you want your firm to be cost-competitive in that
market, you need to produce at least 100,000 units. At smaller volumes, you will have higher costs
than other firms in the industry,which makes it hard for you to stay in the industry.Policy makers are
often interested in learning how large MES is relative to the total market for a product, since when
MES is large relative to the total market size, we typically expect fewer firms to be in the industry.
And, as we will see in the next chapter, competition may be reduced.
Figure 9.4 shows three potential scales of operation, each with its own set of short-run cost
curves. Each point on the LRAC curve represents the minimum cost at which the associated out-
put level can be produced. Once the firm chooses a scale on which to produce, it becomes locked
into one set of cost curves in the short run. If the firm were to settle on scale 1, it would not real-
ize the major cost advantages of producing on a larger scale. By roughly doubling its scale of oper-
ations from 50,000 to 100,000 units (scale 2), the firm reduces average costs per unit significantly.
Figure 9.4 shows that at every moment, firms face two different cost constraints. In the
long run, firms can change their scale of operation, and costs may be different as a result.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Economies of Scale in Solar
Concerns about the environment and interest in sustainable energy
have greatly increased the excitement by both consumers and
investors in alternative energies such as wind and solar power. For
both alternatives, the price of more conventional energy sources, like
oil, is very important. As the price of oil rises, solar power, one of the
substitutes for oil, becomes more viable. But there are also forces at
work on the cost side. As the article below discusses, the process of
producing solar panels is subject to scale economies, so that as the use
of solar panels increases, the long-run average cost of producing
them is likely to fall.
Utility Scale Solar Market Shares, Strategies,
and Forecasts, Worldwide, 2010–2016

Solar energy market driving forces relate to the opportunity
to harness a cheap, long lasting, powerful energy source.
Solar energy can be used to create electricity in huge quan-
tity. Solar panels are mounted in a weatherproof frame and
then mounted in areas with direct exposure to the sun to
generate electricity from sunlight.
Solar power systems are composed of solar modules,
related power electronics, and other components. Solar
panels are used in residential, commercial, and industrial
applications. Solar compositions of arrays that make up
electric utility grids appear to be the wave of the future.
Other solar systems are concentrating systems that lever-
age thermal transport of heated fluids and utilize tradi-
tional steam generators. The demand for solar energy is
dependent on lower prices for solar and higher prices for
petroleum. A combination of economies of scale being
realized in manufacturing along with increases in the cur-
rent prices for petroleum will drive solar energy adoption.
Large solar farms are more popular initially, but solar is
anticipated to be built out on commercial roof tops in
increased quantity. The electricity generated will be fed to
local substations and distributed to homes from there.
There is growing global demand for cost-effective and
reliable solar power. Molten salt storage and solar electricity
generation by use of steam turbines are poised to achieve
significant growth. The economies of scale have not yet
kicked in and will do so after 100 projects have been built
out. The technology promises to be significant because the
projects generate so much electricity.

 FIGURE 9.4 A Firm Exhibiting Economies of Scale
The long-run average cost curve of a firm shows the different scales on which the firm can choose to operate
in the long run. Each scale of operation defines a different short run. Here we see a firm exhibiting economies
of scale; moving from scale 1 to scale 3 reduces average cost.
However, at any given moment, a particular scale of operation exists, constraining the firm’s
capacity to produce in the short run. That is why we see both short- and long-run curves in
the same diagram.
Constant Returns to Scale
Technically, the term constant returns means that the quantitative relationship between input
and output stays constant, or the same, when output is increased. If a firm doubles inputs, it
doubles output; if it triples inputs, it triples output; and so on. Furthermore, if input prices are
fixed, constant returns imply that average cost of production does not change with scale. In
other words, constant returns to scale mean that the firm’s long-run average cost curve
remains flat.
The firm in Figure 9.4 exhibits roughly constant returns to scale between scale 2 and
scale 3. The average cost of production is about the same in each. If the firm exhibited con-
stant returns at levels above 150,000 units of output, the LRAC would continue as a flat,
straight line.
Economists have studied cost data extensively over the years to estimate the extent to which
economies of scale exist. Evidence suggests that in most industries, firms do not have to be gigan-
tic to realize cost savings from scale economies. In other words, the MES is moderate relative to
market size. Perhaps the best example of efficient production on a small scale is the manufactur-
ing sector in Taiwan. Taiwan has enjoyed very rapid growth based on manufacturing firms that
employ fewer than 100 workers.
One simple argument supports the empirical result that most industries seem to exhibit
constant returns to scale (a flat LRAC) after some level of output at least at the level of the
plant. Competition always pushes firms to adopt the least-cost technology and scale. If cost
advantages result with larger-scale operations, the firms that shift to that scale will drive the
smaller, less efficient firms out of business. A firm that wants to grow when it has reached its
“optimal” size can do so by building another identical plant. It thus seems logical to conclude
that most firms face constant returns to scale at the plant level as long as they can replicate
their existing plants.

Decreasing Returns to Scale
When average cost increases with scale of production, a firm faces decreasing returns to scale, or
diseconomies of scale. The most often cited example of a diseconomy of scale is bureaucratic inef-
ficiency. As size increases beyond a certain point, operations tend to become more difficult to
manage. Large size often entails increased bureaucracy, affecting both managerial incentives and
control. The coordination function is more complex for larger firms than for smaller ones, and
the chances that it will break down are greater. You can see that this diseconomy of scale is firm-
level in type.
A large firm is also more likely than a small firm to find itself facing problems with organized
labor. Unions can demand higher wages and more benefits, go on strike, force firms to incur legal
expenses, and take other actions that increase production costs. (This does not mean that unions
are “bad,” but instead that their activities often increase costs.)
U-Shaped Long-Run Average Costs
As we have seen, the shape of a firm’s long-run average cost curve depends on how costs react to
changes in scale. Some firms do see economies of scale, and their long-run average cost curves
slope downward. Most firms seem to have flat long-run average cost curves. Still others encounter
diseconomies, and their long-run average cost curves slope upward.
Figure 9.5 describes a firm that exhibits both economies of scale and diseconomies of scale.
Average costs decrease with scale of plant up to q* and increase with scale after that. The
Economics in Practice on p. 201 discusses the history of the U-shaped curve.
The U-shaped average cost curve looks very much like the short-run average cost curves we
have examined in the last two chapters, but do not confuse the two. All short-run average cost
curves are U-shaped because we assume a fixed scale of plant that constrains production and drives
marginal cost upward as a result of diminishing returns. In the long run, we make no such assump-
tion; instead, we assume that scale of plant can be changed and ask how costs change with scale.
It is important to note that economic efficiency requires taking advantage of economies of
scale (if they exist) and avoiding diseconomies of scale. The optimal scale of plant is the scale of
plant that minimizes average cost. In fact, as we will see next, competition forces firms to use the
optimal scale. In Figure 9.5, q* is the unique optimal scale.
Long-Run Adjustments to Short-Run
Conditions
We began this chapter by discussing the different short-run positions in which firms like Blue Velvet
may find themselves. Firms can be operating at a profit or suffering economic losses; they can be
shut down or producing. The industry is not in long-run equilibrium if firms have an incentive to

CHAPTER 9
Long-Run Costs and Output Decisions 201
enter or exit in the long run. Thus, when firms are earning economic profits (profits above normal,
or positive) or are suffering economic losses (profits below normal, or negative), the industry is not
at an equilibrium and firms will change their behavior. What firms are likely to do depends in part
on costs in the long run. This is why we have spent a good deal of time discussing economies and
diseconomies of scale.
We can now put these two ideas together and discuss the actual long-run adjustments that
are likely to take place in response to short-run profits and losses.
Short-Run Profits: Moves In and Out of Equilibrium
Consider a competitive market in which demand and costs have been stable for some period and
the industry is in equilibrium. The market price is such that firms are earning a normal rate of
return and the flow of firms in and out of the industry balances out. Firms are producing as effi-
ciently as possible, and supply equals demand. Figure 9.6 shows this situation at a price of $6 and
an output of 200,000 units for an industry with a U-shaped long-run cost curve.
Now suppose demand increases. Perhaps this is the market for green tea, and there has been a
news report on the health benefits of the tea. What happens? Managers at the firms notice the
demand increase—they too read the paper! But each firm has a fixed capital stock—it owns a set
tea plantation, for example. Entry also is impossible in the short run. But existing firms can do
something to meet the new demand, even within the constraints of their existing plant. They can
hire overtime workers, for example, to increase yield. But this increases average costs. In Figure 9.7,
firms will move up their SRMC curves as they produce output beyond the level of 2,000. Why do
firms do this? Because the increased demand has increased the price. The new higher price makes
it worthwhile for the firms to increase their output even though in the short run it is expensive to
do so. In fact, the firms increase output as long as the new price is greater than the short-run mar-
ginal cost curve. We have noted the new short-run equilibrium in Figure 9.7.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
The Long-Run Average Cost Curve: Flat or U-Shaped?
The long-run average cost curve has been a source of controversy in
economics for many years. A long-run average cost curve was first
drawn as the “envelope” of a series of short-run curves in a classic
article written by Jacob Viner in 1931.1 In preparing that article,Viner
gave his draftsman the task of drawing the long-run curve through
the minimum points of all the short-run average cost curves.
In a supplementary note written in 1950, Viner commented:
... the error in Chart IV is left uncorrected so that future
teachers and students may share the pleasure of many of
their predecessors of pointing out that if I had known what
an envelope was, I would not have given my excellent
draftsman the technically impossible and economically
inappropriate task of drawing an AC curve which would
pass through the lowest cost points of all the AC curves yet
not rise above any AC curve at any point....2
While this story is an interesting part of the lore of economics, a
more recent debate concentrates on the economic content of this
controversy. In 1986, Professor Herbert Simon of Carnegie-Mellon
University stated bluntly in an interview for Challenge magazine that
most textbooks are wrong to use the U-shaped long-run cost curve
to predict the size of firms. Simon explained that studies show the
firm’s cost curves are not U-shaped but instead slope down to the
right and then level off.3
What difference does it make if
the long-run average cost curve has
a long flat section with no upturn?
In this case, there is no single point
on the long-run curve that is the
best. Once a firm achieves some
scale, it has the same costs no mat-
ter how much larger it gets. As
Simon tells us, this means we can’t
predict firm size. But we can still
predict industry size: In this situa-
tion, we still have forces of profit
seeking causing firms to enter and
exit until excess profits are zero. The unique industry output is the one
that corresponds to a price equal to long-run average cost that also
equates supply and demand. Simon is right that this type of cost curve
means the economic theory doesn’t explain everything, but it still tells
us a good deal.

Again supply equals demand. But there are two important differences. First, and most
important, firms are making profits. The profits are noted in the gray-shaded rectangle in
Figure 9.8 and are the difference between the new higher price and the new higher average
cost. Second, firms are also operating at too large an output level for minimum average cost.
Managers in these firms are scrambling to get increased output from a plant designed for a
smaller output level.

The individual firm on the right is producing 2,000 units, and so we also know that the industry consists of
100 firms. All firms are identical, and all are producing at the uniquely best output level of 2,000 units.

CHAPTER 9
Long-Run Costs and Output Decisions 203
What happens next? Other entrepreneurs observing the industry see the excess profits and
enter. Each one enters at a scale of 2,000 because that is the optimal scale in this industry.
Perhaps existing firms also build new plants. With each new entry, the industry supply curve
(which is just the sum of all the individual firms’ supply curves) shifts to the right. More sup-
ply is available because there are more firms. Price begins to fall. As long as the price is above
$6, each of the firms, both old and new, is making excess profits and more entry will occur.
Once price is back to $6, there are no longer excess profits and thus no further entry. Figure 9.8
shows this new equilibrium where supply has shifted sufficiently to return the industry to the
original price of $6 at a new quantity level.
Again, notice the characteristics of the final equilibrium: Each individual firm chooses a scale
of operations that minimizes its long-run average cost. It operates this plant at an output level
that minimizes short-run average cost. In equilibrium, each firm has
SRMC = SRAC = LRAC
Firms make no excess profits so that
P = SRMC = SRAC = LRAC
and there are enough firms so that supply equals demand.
Suppose instead of a positive demand shock, the industry experiences an unexpected cut in
demand. Precisely the same economic logic holds.When demand falls (shifts to the left), the price
falls. In the short run, firms cannot shrink plants, nor can they exit. But with the lower price,
firms begin to produce less in their plants than before. In fact, firms cut back production so long
as the price they receive is less than their short-run marginal cost. At this point, firms earn losses
and are producing at too small a level and thus have higher average cost than before. Some firms
drop out, and when they do so, the supply curve shifts to the left. How many firms leave? Enough
so that the equilibrium is restored with the price again at $6 and the industry output has fallen
reduced to reflect the reduced demand for the product.

The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
The Long-Run Adjustment Mechanism: Investment Flows
Toward Profit Opportunities
The central idea in our discussion of entry, exit, expansion, and contraction is this: In efficient
markets, investment capital flows toward profit opportunities. The actual process is complex and
varies from industry to industry.
We talked about efficient markets in Chapter 1. In efficient markets, profit opportunities are
quickly eliminated as they develop. To illustrate this point, we described driving up to a toll booth
and suggested that shorter-than-average lines are quickly eliminated as cars shift into those lines.
Profits in competitive industries also are eliminated as new competing firms move into open
slots, or perceived opportunities, in the industry.
In practice, the entry and exit of firms in response to profit opportunities usually involve the
financial capital market. In capital markets, people are constantly looking for profits. When firms
in an industry do well, capital is likely to flow into that industry in a variety of forms.
Entrepreneurs start new firms, and firms producing entirely different products may join the
competition to break into new markets. It happens all around us. The tremendous success of pre-
mium ice cream makers Ben and Jerry’s and Häagen-Dazs spawned dozens of competitors. In
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
The Fortunes of the Auto Industry
In 2010 the majority shareholder in General Motors, once counted
among the top Fortune 500 firms, was the U.S. government. The
government bought its interest in General Motors as a “reluctant
shareholder” to help the firm move out of the bankruptcy that it
entered in 2009.
The article below describes the return of the firm to profitability
in mid-2010. We can use the tools of this chapter to dig into the
lessons of the article.
GM Reports First Quarterly Profit Since 2007
The Wall Street Journal
Ten months after emerging from a government-orchestrated
bankruptcy, General Motors Co. on Monday reported its first
quarterly profit in three years, driven by dramatic cost reduc-
tions and improved global sales.
GM made $863 million in the first three months of 2010,
compared with a $6 billion loss a year earlier, a performance
that surprised analysts who expected more modest results.
Revenue grew 40 percent to $31.5 billion, and the company
generated $1 billion in cash.
GM has managed to drive up prices by building fewer
vehicles and turning out cars and trucks more desirable to
U.S. consumers, such as GM’s revamped Chevrolet Equinox
crossover, while tighter supply means the company doesn’t
have to rely on deals to clear out inventory. 
Another factor: In North America, GM’s factories are
operating at 84 percent of capacity, up from less than 
40 percent a year ago. Underutilized factories are a major
cost drain for auto makers.
The company, meantime, has increased global sales by
24 percent amid rapid growth in emerging markets,
including China. 
Cost reductions made possible by last year’s bankruptcy
were a major factor in GM’s profit.

How has GM improved profits? First,demand for autos shifted right
as the recession eased and GM built vehicles “more desirable to U.S.
consumers,”as the article tells us.The demand shift allowed GM to raise
prices and allowed it to sell more vehicles.Improved sales also helped on
the cost side. The auto industry exhibits large economies of scale due in
part to the large capital investment of the assembly lines. In the
2008–2009 recession, the auto industry found itself with excess capacity
(the article tells us GM was operating at 40 percent capacity in the
trough) and the per unit costs of cars rocketed up. By using more of its
capacity, average costs fell, making for better profitability.
The demand shift is only part of the story, however. GM had also
taken other actions, both in terms of union wage negotiations and
restructuring, to reduce its costs. This had the effect of shifting down
the long-run average cost curve, further increasing profits. A hard
question now being asked is whether these cost reductions will be
long lived.

Long-Run Costs and Output Decisions 205
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Why Are Hot Dogs So Expensive in Central Park?
Recently, one of the authors of this textbook was walking in Central
Park in New York City. Since it was lunchtime and she was hungry,she
decided to indulge her secret passion for good old-fashioned hot dogs.
Because she did this frequently, she was well aware that the standard
price for a hot dog in New York City was $1.50. So she was surprised
when she handed the vendor $2 that she received no change back.As it
turned out, the price of a hot dog inside the park was $2.00, not the
$1.50 vendors charged elsewhere in the city. Since she was trained as
an economist, she wanted to know what caused the difference in price.
First, she looked to the demand side of the market. If hot dogs
are selling for $2.00 in the park but only $1.50 outside the park, peo-
ple must be willing and able to pay more for them in the park. Why?
Perhaps hot dogs are more enjoyable to people when eaten while
walking through Central Park. Hot dogs and “walking through the
park” may be complementary goods. Or maybe people who walk in
the park at noon are richer.
You might ask, if hot dogs are available outside the park for $1.50,
why don’t people buy them there and bring them to the park? The
fact is that hot dogs are good only when they are hot, and they get
cold very quickly. A hot dog purchased 5 minutes away from Central
Park will be stone cold by the time someone reaches the park.
But looking at the demand side is not enough to understand a
market. We also have to explain the behavior of the hot dog vendors
who comprise the supply side of the market. On the supply side, the
author knew that the market for hot dogs was virtually perfectly com-
petitive outside the park. First, the product is homogeneous.
Essentially all vendors supply the same product: a standard quality-
certified hot dog and two varieties of mustard. Second, there is free
entry. Since most vendors have wheels on their carts, if the price of hot
dogs rises above $1.50 in one part of town, we would expect vendors
to move there. The added supply would then push prices back to Price
(P) = short-run marginal cost (SRAC) = long-run average cost
(LRAC). At P = $1.50, individual vendors around the city must be
earning enough to cover average costs including a normal rate of
return (see the discussion in the text on p. 190). If the market price
produces excess profits, new vendors will show up to compete those
excess profits away.
All of this would suggest that the price of hot dogs should be the
same everywhere in New York City. If a vendor is able to charge $2 in
the park and has the same costs as a vendor outside the park, he
must be earning above-normal profits. After all, the vendor makes
$.50 more on each hot dog. Something must be preventing the out-
side vendors from rolling their carts into the park, which would
increase the supply of hot dogs and drive the price back to $1.50.
That something is a more expensive license. In New York, you
need a license to operate a hot dog cart, and a license to operate in
the park costs more. Since hot dogs are $0.50 more in the park, the
added cost of a license each year must be roughly $0.50 per hot dog
sold. In fact, in New York City, licenses to sell hot dogs in the park
are auctioned off for many thousands of dollars, while licenses to
operate in more remote parts of the city cost only about $1,000.
one Massachusetts town of 35,000, a small ice cream store opened to rave reviews, long lines, and
high prices and positive profits.Within a year, there were four new ice cream/frozen yogurt stores,
no lines, and lower prices. Magic? No, just the natural functioning of competition.
A powerful example of an industry expanding with higher prices and higher economic prof-
its is the housing sector prior to 2007. From the late 1990s until early 2006, the housing market
was booming nationally. Demand was shifting to the right for a number of reasons. As it did,
housing prices rose substantially and with them the profits being made by builders. As builders
responded with higher output, the number of new units started (housing starts) increased to
a near record level of over 2.2 million per year in 2005. Construction employment grew to over
7.5 million.
Starting in 2006, housing demand shifted to the left. The inventory of unsold property began
to build, and prices started to fall. That turned profits into losses. Home builders cut their produc-
tion, and many went out of business. These moves had major ramifications for the performance
of the whole economy. Go back and look at Figure 9.7 and Figure 9.8. Make sure you understand
how these diagrams explain both the expansion and contraction of the housing sector since 2000.
Many believe that part of the explosion of technology-based dot-com companies is due to
the ease of entering the sector. All it takes to start a company is an idea, a terminal, and Web
access. The number of new firms entering the industry is so large that statistical agencies cannot
keep pace.

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
Output Markets: A Final Word
In the last four chapters, we have been building a model of a simple market system under the
assumption of perfect competition. Let us provide just one more example to review the actual
response of a competitive system to a change in consumer preferences.
Over the past two decades, Americans have developed a taste for wine in general and for
California wines in particular. We know that household demand is constrained by income,
wealth, and prices and that income is (at least in part) determined by the choices that house-
holds make. Within these constraints, households increasingly choose—or demand—wine.
The demand curve for wine has shifted to the right, causing excess demand followed by an
increase in price.
With higher prices, wine producers find themselves earning positive profits. This increase
in price and consequent rise in profits is the basic signal that leads to a reallocation of society’s
resources. In the short run, wine producers are constrained by their current scales of operation.
California has only a limited number of vineyards and only a limited amount of vat capacity,
for example.
In the long run, however, we would expect to see resources flow in to compete for these
profits, and this is exactly what happens. New firms enter the wine-producing business. New
vines are planted, and new vats and production equipment are purchased and put in place.
Vineyard owners move into new states—Rhode Island, Texas, and Maryland—and established
growers increase production. Overall, more wine is produced to meet the new consumer
demand. At the same time, competition is forcing firms to operate using the most efficient tech-
nology available.
What starts as a shift in preferences thus ends up as a shift in resources. Land is reallocated,
and labor moves into wine production. All this is accomplished without any central planning 
or direction.
You have now seen what lies behind the demand curves and supply curves in competitive
output markets. The next two chapters take up competitive input markets and complete 
the picture.
S U M M A R Y
1. For any firm, one of three conditions holds at any given
moment: (1) The firm is earning positive profits, (2) the
firm is suffering losses, or (3) the firm is just breaking
even—that is, earning a normal rate of return and thus
zero profits.
SHORT-RUN CONDITIONS AND LONG-RUN
DIRECTIONS p. 190
2. A firm that is earning positive profits in the short run and
expects to continue doing so has an incentive to expand in
the long run. Profits also provide an incentive for new firms
to enter the industry.
When there is promise of positive profits, investments are made and output expands. When
firms end up suffering losses, firms contract and some go out of business. It can take quite a
while, however, for an industry to achieve long-run competitive equilibrium, the point at which
P = SRMC = SRAC = LRAC and profits are zero. In fact, because costs and tastes are in a constant
state of flux, very few industries ever really get there. The economy is always changing. There are
always some firms making profits and some firms suffering losses.
This, then, is a story about tendencies:
Investment—in the form of new firms and expanding old firms—will over time tend to
favor those industries in which profits are being made; and over time, industries in which
firms are suffering losses will gradually contract from disinvestment.

1. For each of the following, decide whether you agree or disagree
and explain your answer:
a. Firms that exhibit constant returns to scale have U-shaped
long-run average cost curves.
b. A firm suffering losses in the short run will continue to
operate as long as total revenue at least covers fixed cost.
2. Ajax is a competitive firm operating under the following condi-
tions: Price of output is $5, the profit-maximizing level of out-
put is 20,000 units of output, and the total cost (full economic
cost) of producing 20,000 units is $120,000. The firm’s only
fixed factor of production is a $300,000 stock of capital (a
building). If the interest rate available on comparable risks is
10 percent, should this firm shut down immediately in the short
run? Explain your answer.
3. Explain why it is possible that a firm with a production function
that exhibits increasing returns to scale can run into diminish-
ing returns at the same time.
4. Which of the following industries do you think are likely to
exhibit large economies of scale? Explain why in each case.
a. Home building
b. Electric power generation
c. Vegetable farming
d. Software development
e. Aircraft manufacturing
3. In the short run, firms suffering losses are stuck in the
industry. They can shut down operations (q = 0), but they
must still bear fixed costs. In the long run, firms suffering
losses can exit the industry.
4. A firm’s decision about whether to shut down in the short
run depends solely on whether its total revenue from operat-
ing is sufficient to cover its total variable cost. If total rev-
enue exceeds total variable cost, the excess can be used to pay
some fixed costs and thus reduce losses.
5. Anytime that price is below the minimum point on the
average variable cost curve, total revenue will be less than
total variable cost, and the firm will shut down. The mini-
mum point on the average variable cost curve (which is
also the point where marginal cost and average variable
cost intersect) is called the shutdown point. At all prices
above the shutdown point, the MC curve shows the profit-
maximizing level of output. At all prices below it, optimal
short-run output is zero.
6. The short-run supply curve of a firm in a perfectly competi-
tive industry is the portion of its marginal cost curve that
lies above its average variable cost curve.
7. Two things can cause the industry supply curve to shift: (1) in
the short run, anything that causes marginal costs to change
across the industry, such as an increase in the price of a par-
ticular input, and (2) in the long run, entry or exit of firms.
LONG-RUN COSTS: ECONOMIES AND
DISECONOMIES OF SCALE p. 195
8. When an increase in a firm’s scale of production leads to
lower average costs, the firm exhibits increasing returns to
scale, or economies of scale. When average costs do not
change with the scale of production, the firm exhibits
constant returns to scale. When an increase in a firm’s scale of
production leads to higher average costs, the firm exhibits
decreasing returns to scale, or diseconomies of scale.
9. A firm’s long-run average cost curve (LRAC) shows the costs
associated with different scales on which it can choose to
operate in the long run.
LONG-RUN ADJUSTMENTS TO SHORT-RUN
CONDITIONS p. 200
10. When short-run profits exist in an industry, firms enter and
existing firms expand. These events shift the industry supply
curve to the right. When this happens, price falls and ulti-
mately profits are eliminated.
11. When short-run losses are suffered in an industry, some
firms exit and some firms reduce scale. These events shift the
industry supply curve to the left, raising price and eliminat-
ing losses.
12. Long-run competitive equilibrium is reached when P = SRMC
= SRAC = LRAC and profits are zero.
13. In efficient markets, investment capital flows toward profit
opportunities.

11. According to its Web site, Netflix is the world’s largest online
entertainment subscription service. It ships over 2 million
DVDs daily to its more than 15 million members. On its Web
site, Netflix indicates that its growth strategy is to “focus on sub-
scription growth in order to realize economies of scale.” In this
business, where do you think scale economies come from?
12. From 2000 to 2005, the home building sector was expanding and
new housing construction as measured by housing starts was
approaching an all-time high. (At www.census.gov, click
“Housing,” then click “Construction data.”) Big builders such as
Lennar Corporation were making exceptional profits. The indus-
try was expanding. Existing home building firms invested in
more capacity and raised output. New home building firms
entered the industry. From 2006 to 2009, demand for new and
existing homes dropped. The inventory of unsold homes grew
sharply. Home prices began to fall. Home builders suffered
losses, and the industry contracted. Many firms went out of busi-
ness, and many workers in the construction industry went bank-
rupt. Use the Internet to verify that all of these events happened.
Access www.bls.gov for employment data and www.bea.gov for
information on residential construction as part of gross domes-
tic product. What has happened since the beginning of 2010?
Has the housing market recovered? Have housing starts stopped
falling? If so, at what level? Write a short essay about whether the
housing sector is about to expand or contract.
13. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 205] St. Mark’s
Square is a beautiful plaza in Venice that is often frequented by
both tourists and pigeons. Ringing the piazza are many small,
privately owned cafes. In these cafes, a cappuccino costs 7 euros
despite the fact that an equally good cappuccino costs only
3 euros a block a way. What is going on here?
14. The following problem traces the relationship between firm
decisions, market supply, and market equilibrium in a perfectly
competitive market.
a. Complete the following table for a single firm in the short run.
If the price of output is $7, how many units of output will this
firm produce? What is the total revenue? What is the total cost?
Will the firm operate or shut down in the short run? in the long
run? Briefly explain your answers.
10. The concept of economies of scale refers to lower per-unit pro-
duction costs at higher levels of output. The easiest way to
understand this is to look at whether long-run average cost
decreases with output (economies of scale) or whether long-run
average cost increases with output (diseconomies of scale). If
average cost is constant as output rises, there is constant returns
to scale. But the concept of falling unit costs is all around us.
Explain how the concept of economies of scale helps shed light
on each of the following:
a. car pooling
6. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 201] Do you agree
or disagree with the following statements? Explain in a sentence
or two.
a. A firm will never sell its product for less than it costs to
produce it.
b. If the short-run marginal cost curve is U-shaped, the long-
run average cost curve is likely to be U-shaped as well.
7. The Smythe chicken farm outside Little Rock, Arkansas, pro-
duces 25,000 chickens per month. Total cost of production at
Smythe Farm is $28,000. Down the road are two other farms.
Faubus Farm produces 55,000 chickens a month, and total cost
is $50,050. Mega Farm produces 100,000 chickens per month, at
a total cost of $91,000. These data suggest that there are signifi-
cant economies of scale in chicken production. Do you agree or
disagree with this statement? Explain your answer.
8. Indicate whether you agree or disagree with the following state-
ments. Briefly explain your answers.
a. Increasing returns to scale refers to a situation where an
increase in a firm’s scale of production leads to higher costs
per unit produced.
b. Constant returns to scale refers to a situation where an
increase in a firm’s scale of production has no effect on costs
per unit produced.
c. Decreasing returns to scale refers to a situation where an
increase in a firm’s scale of production leads to lower costs
per unit produced.
9. You are given the following cost data:

CHAPTER 9
Long-Run Costs and Output Decisions 209
a. Use the data in the table and draw a graph for the represen-
tative firm in the industry when the industry demand curve
is represented by D1. What is the profit or loss for this firm?
Shade in the profit or loss area on the graph.
b. Draw a graph for the representative firm when the industry
demand curve falls to D2. What is the profit or loss for this
firm? Shade in the profit or loss area on the graph.
c. Draw a graph for the representative firm when the industry
demand curve falls to D3. What is the profit or loss for this
firm? Shade in the profit or loss area on the graph.
17. For each of the three scenarios in the previous question (p* = 10,
p* = 6, and p* = 3), explain the long-run incentives for each
representative firm in the industry. Also explain what should
happen to the size of the industry as a whole.
18. Construct a graph with AVC, ATC, and MC curves. On this
graph add a marginal revenue curve for a representative firm in
a perfectly competitive industry which is maximizing profits at a
price of p*1. Add a second marginal revenue curve for a firm
which is minimizing losses but continues to produce when the
price is p*2. Add a third marginal revenue curve for a firm
which is shutting down when the price is p*3. Explain where you
decided to place each of the marginal revenue curves and iden-
tify the shutdown point on the graph.
19. The shape of a firm’s long-run average cost curve depends on
how costs vary with scale of operation. Draw a long-run average
cost curve for a firm which exhibits economies of scale, constant
returns to scale, and diseconomies of scale. Identify each of
these sections of the cost curve and explain why each section
exemplifies its specific type of returns to scale.

*15. Assume that you are hired as an analyst at a major New York
consulting firm. Your first assignment is to do an industry
analysis of the tribble industry. After extensive research and two
all-nighters, you have obtained the following information:
 Long-run costs:
Capital costs: $5 per unit of output
Labor costs: $2 per unit of output
 No economies or diseconomies of scale
 Industry currently earning a normal return to capital (profit
of zero)
 Industry perfectly competitive, with each of 100 firms pro-
ducing the same amount of output
 Total industry output: 1.2 million tribbles
Demand for tribbles is expected to grow rapidly over the
next few years to a level twice as high as it is now, but (due to
short-run diminishing returns) each of the 100 existing
firms is likely to be producing only 50 percent more.

CHAPTER 9 APPENDIX
External Economies and
Diseconomies and the Long-Run
Industry Supply Curve
Sometimes average costs increase or decrease with the size of
the industry, in addition to responding to changes in the size of
the firm itself. When long-run average costs decrease as a result
of industry growth, we say that there are external economies.
When average costs increase as a result of industry growth, we
say that there are external diseconomies. (Remember the dis-
tinction between internal and external economies: Internal
economies of scale are found within firms, whereas external
economies occur on an industry-wide basis.)
The expansion of the home building sector of the econ-
omy between 2000 and 2005 illustrates how external disec-
onomies of scale arise and how they imply a rising long-run
average cost curve.
Beginning in 2000, the overall economy suffered a slow-
down as the dot-com exuberance turned to a bursting stock
market bubble, and the events of 9/11 raised the specter of
international terrorism.
One sector, however, came alive between 2000 and 2005:
housing. Very low interest rates lowered the monthly cost of
home ownership, immigration increased the number of
households, millions of baby boomers traded up and bought
second homes, and investors who had been burned by the
stock market bust turned to housing as a “real” asset.
All of this increased the demand for single-family homes
and condominiums around the country. Table 9A.1 shows
what happened to house prices, output, and the costs of inputs
during the first 5 years of the decade.
First, house prices began to rise faster than other prices
while the cost of construction materials stayed flat. Profitability
in the home building sector took off. Next, as existing builders
expanded their operations, new firms started up. The number
of new housing units “started” stood at just over 1.5 million
annually in 2000 and then rose to over 2 million by 2005. All of
this put pressure on the prices of construction materials such as
lumber and wallboard. The table shows that construction mate-
rials costs rose more than 8 percent in 2004. These input prices
increased the costs of home building. The expanding industry
caused external diseconomies of scale.
The Long-Run Industry Supply Curve
Recall that long-run competitive equilibrium is achieved when
entering firms responding to profits or exiting firms fleeing
from losses drive price to a level that just covers long-run average

costs. Profits are zero, and P = LRAC = SRAC = SRMC. At this
point,individual firms are operating at the most efficient scale of
plant—that is, at the minimum point on their LRAC curve.
As we saw in the text, long-run equilibrium is not easily
achieved. Even if a firm or an industry does achieve long-run
equilibrium, it will not remain at that point indefinitely.
Economies are dynamic. As population and the stock of capital
grow and as preferences and technology change, some sectors
will expand and some will contract. How do industries adjust
to long-term changes? The answer depends on both internal
and external factors.
The extent of internal economies (or diseconomies) deter-
mines the shape of a firm’s long-run average cost curve (LRAC).
If a firm changes its scale and either expands or contracts, its
average costs will increase, decrease, or stay the same along the
LRAC curve. Recall that the LRAC curve shows the relationship
between a firm’s output (q) and average total cost (ATC). A firm
enjoying internal economies will see costs decreasing as it
expands its scale; a firm facing internal diseconomies will see
costs increasing as it expands its scale.
However, external economies and diseconomies have noth-
ing to do with the size of individual firms in a competitive mar-
ket. Because individual firms in perfectly competitive industries
are very small relative to the market, other firms are affected
only minimally when an individual firm changes its output or
scale of operation. External economies and diseconomies arise
from industry expansions; that is, they arise when many firms
increase their output simultaneously or when new firms enter
an industry. If industry expansion causes costs to increase
(external diseconomies), the LRAC curves facing individual
firms shift upward; costs increase regardless of the level of out-
put finally chosen by the firm. Similarly, if industry expansion
causes costs to decrease (external economies), the LRAC curves
facing individual firms shift downward; costs decrease at all
potential levels of output.
An example of an expanding industry facing external
economies is illustrated in Figure 9A.1. Initially, the industry
and the representative firm are in long-run competitive equi-
librium at the price P0 determined by the intersection of the
initial demand curve D0 and the initial supply curve S0. P0 is

In a decreasing-cost industry, average cost declines as the industry expands. As demand expands from D0 to D1, price rises from P0 to P1.
As new firms enter and existing firms expand, supply shifts from S0 to S1, driving price down. If costs decline as a result of the expansion
to LRAC2, the final price will be below P0 at P2. The long-run industry supply curve (LRIS) slopes downward in a decreasing-cost industry.

the long-run equilibrium price; it intersects the initial long-
run average cost curve (LRAC0) at its minimum point. At this
point, economic profits are zero.
Let us assume that as time passes, demand increases—that
is, the demand curve shifts to the right from D0 to D1. This
increase in demand will push price all the way to P1. Without
drawing the short-run cost curves, we know that economic
profits now exist and that firms are likely to enter the industry to
compete for them. In the absence of external economies or dis-
economies, firms would enter the industry, shifting the supply
curve to the right and driving price back to the bottom of the
long-run
average
cost
curve, where
profits
are
zero.
Nevertheless, the industry in Figure 9A.1 enjoys external
economies. As firms enter and the industry expands, costs
decrease; and as the supply curve shifts to the right from S0
toward S1, the long-run average cost curve shifts downward to
LRAC2. Thus, to reach the new long-run equilibrium level of
price and output, the supply curve must shift all the way to S1.
Only when the supply curve reaches S1 is price driven down to
the new equilibrium price of P2, the minimum point on the new
long-run average cost curve.
Presumably, further expansion would lead to even greater
savings because the industry encounters external economies.
The red dashed line in Figure 9A.1(a) that traces out price and
total output over time as the industry expands is called the
long-run industry supply curve (LRIS). When an industry
enjoys external economies, its long-run supply curve slopes
down. Such an industry is called a decreasing-cost industry.
Figure 9A.2 shows the long-run industry supply curve for
an industry that faces external diseconomies. (These were suf-
fered in the construction industry, you will recall, when
increased house building activity drove up lumber prices.) As
demand expands from D0 to D1, price is driven up from P0 to
P1. In response to the resulting higher profits, firms enter,
shifting the short-run supply schedule to the right and driving
price down. However, this time, as the industry expands, the
long-run average cost curve shifts up to LRAC2 as a result of
external diseconomies. Now, price has to fall back only to P2
(the minimum point on LRAC2), not all the way to P0, to elim-
inate economic profits. This type of industry, whose long-run
industry supply curve slopes up to the right, is called an
increasing-cost industry.
It should not surprise you to know that industries in
which there are no external economies or diseconomies of
scale have flat, or horizontal, long-run industry supply curves.
These industries are called constant-cost industries.

which average costs rise as the industry expands. It exhibits
external diseconomies, and its long-run industry supply

that shows no external economies or diseconomies as the

zontal, or flat.

In 2009 the average yearly wage for
a welder was $36,630, while the
average yearly wage for a computer
programmer was $74,690. What
determines these wages? Why is the
price for an acre of land in Toledo,
Ohio, less than it is in San
Francisco, California? It should not
surprise you to learn that the same
forces of supply and demand that
determine the prices of the goods
and services we consume can also
be used to explain what happens in
the markets for inputs like labor,
land, and capital. These input markets are the subject of our next two chapters. In this chapter we
set out a basic framework and discuss labor and land, while in Chapter 11 we tackle the more
complicated topic of capital and investment.
Input Markets: Basic Concepts
As we begin to discuss the market for labor and land, four concepts will be important to under-
stand: derived demand, complementary and substitutable inputs, diminishing returns, and mar-
ginal revenue product. Once we outline these four concepts, we will be in a position to look at
supply and demand in input markets.
Demand for Inputs: A Derived Demand
When we looked at the Blue Velvet Car Wash in Chapter 9, we saw that the number and price of
car washes depended on, among other things, how much drivers liked getting their cars washed
(the demand curve). If we want to explain the price of ice cream, knowing that most people
have a sweet tooth would be helpful. Now think about the demand for a welder. Why might
someone have a demand for a welder? In input markets, the reason we demand something is
not because it is itself useful, but because it can be used to produce something else that we
want. We demand a welder because he or she is needed to make a car and that car has value.
The central difference between the demand for goods and services and the demand for an
input is that input demand is a derived demand. The higher the demand for cars, the higher
the demand for welders.

productivity of an input
The
amount of output produced
per unit of that input.
Valuing an input requires us to look at the output that the input is used to produce. The
productivity of an input is the amount of output produced per unit of that input. When a large
amount of output is produced per unit of an input, the input is said to exhibit high productivity.
When only a small amount of output is produced per unit of the input, the input is said to exhibit
low productivity.
In the press, we often read about conflicts between labor unions and manufacturing firms.
But understanding that labor demand is a derived demand shows us the common ground
between labor and management: An increase in the demand for a product potentially improves
the position not only of owners of the firm producing that good, but also the position of work-
ers providing labor input.
Inputs: Complementary and Substitutable
Inputs can be complementary or substitutable. Two inputs used together may enhance, or comple-
ment, each other. For example, a new machine is often useless without someone to run it.
Machines can also be substituted for labor, or—less often—labor can be substituted for machines.
All this means that a firm’s input demands are tightly linked to one another. An increase or
decrease in wages naturally causes the demand for labor to change, but it may also have an effect
on the demand for capital or land. If we are to understand the demand for inputs, therefore, we
must understand the connections among labor, capital, and land.
Diminishing Returns
Recall that the short run is the period during which some fixed factor of production limits a
firm’s capacity to expand. Under these conditions, the firm that decides to increase output will
eventually encounter diminishing returns. Stated more formally, a fixed scale of plant means that
the marginal product of variable inputs eventually declines.
Recall also that marginal product of labor (MPL) is the additional output produced if a
firm hires 1 additional unit of labor. For example, if a firm pays for 400 hours of labor per week—
10 workers working 40 hours each—and asks one worker to stay an extra hour, the product of the
401st hour is the marginal product of labor for that firm.
In Chapter 7, we talked at some length about declining marginal product at a sandwich
shop. The first two columns of Table 10.1 reproduce some of the production data from that
shop. You may remember that the shop has only one grill, at which only two or three people
can work comfortably. In this example, the grill is the fixed factor of production in the short
run. Labor is the variable factor. The first worker can produce 10 sandwiches per hour, and the
second worker can produce 15 (column 3 of Table 10.1). The second worker can produce more
because the first worker is busy answering the phone and taking care of customers, as well as
making sandwiches. After the second worker, however, marginal product declines. The third
worker adds only 10 sandwiches per hour because the grill gets crowded. The fourth worker
can squeeze in quickly while the others are serving or wrapping, but he or she adds only five
additional sandwiches each hour, and so on.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Sometimes Workers Play Hooky!
In this chapter we have described the connection between firm
demand for workers and the productivity of those workers. In
practice, firms know that worker productivity is not always the
same each day. Monday mornings and Friday afternoons are
sometimes less productive than the mid week, and employers
typically think of average productivity over a time period as
they contemplate hiring workers.
The article below describes the way in which the World Cup
matches, which occur every four years, tend to disrupt the
usual worker productivity, especially in soccer-crazy countries
like the United Kingdom. In the summer of 2010, the World
Cup was held in South Africa. Spain won, but in many firms,
productivity took a hit!

To Minimize Productivity Drop, They Juggle Worker
Schedules and Bring In TVs

The World Cup’s winner won’t be determined until July. But
there are already clear losers: bosses.
On Friday, managers on both sides of the Atlantic braced
for the quadrennial month-long productivity drain that soc-
cer's global championship brings. The tournament lasts more
than four weeks, with many games scheduled in the middle of
the workday in the Americas and Europe.
In soccer-mad countries like the U.K., many companies
don’t even try to ban the matches. Some let employees watch
games at work. At others, managers juggle staffers’ sched-
ules to accommodate game-watching.
In Paraguay, President Fernando Lugo issued a decree giv-
ing public workers Monday afternoon off to watch Paraguay’s
game against Italy.
In past years, the U.S. was mostly immune to the contagion.
But this year, Americans’ growing World Cup curiosity sparked
scattered hooky outbreaks on Friday, the first day of play.
In the U.K., productivity losses tied to the World Cup could
total just under £1 billion ($1.45 billion), according to a survey by
the Chartered Management Institute. Just over half of working
men and 21 percent of working women intend to watch the
matches scheduled to take place during office hours as they
happen, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP survey of
1,000 U.K. workers.

marginal revenue product
(MRP)
The additional
revenue a firm earns by
employing 1 additional unit of
input, ceteris paribus.
In this case, the grill’s capacity ultimately limits output. To see how the firm might make a
rational choice about how many workers to hire, we need to know more about the value of the
firm’s product and the cost of labor.
Marginal Revenue Product
The marginal revenue product (MRP) of a variable input is the additional revenue a firm earns
by employing 1 additional unit of that input, ceteris paribus. If labor is the variable factor, for
example, hiring an additional unit will lead to added output (the marginal product of labor). The
sale of that added output will yield revenue. Marginal revenue product is the revenue produced by
selling the good or service that is produced by the marginal unit of labor. In a competitive firm,
marginal revenue product is the value of a factor’s marginal product.
By using labor as our variable factor, we can state this proposition more formally by saying
that if MPL is the marginal product of labor and PX is the price of output, then the marginal rev-
enue product of labor is
MRPL = MPL  PX
When calculating marginal revenue product, we need to be precise about what is being pro-
duced. A sandwich shop sells sandwiches, but it does not produce the bread, meat, cheese, mustard,

and mayonnaise that go into the sandwiches. What the shop is producing is “sandwich cooking
and assembly services.” The shop is “adding value” to the meat, bread, and other ingredients by
preparing and putting them all together in ready-to-eat form. With this in mind, let us assume
that each finished sandwich in our shop sells for $0.50 over and above the costs of its ingredients.
Thus, the price of the service the shop is selling is $0.50 per sandwich, and the only variable cost of
providing that service is that of the labor used to put the sandwiches together. Thus, if X is the
product of our shop, PX = $0.50.
Table 10.1, column 5, calculates the marginal revenue product of each worker if the shop
charges $0.50 per sandwich over and above the costs of its ingredients. The first worker produces
10 sandwiches per hour, which at $0.50 each, generates revenues of $5.00 per hour. The addition
of a second worker yields $7.50 an hour in revenues. After the second worker, diminishing
returns drive MRPL down. The marginal revenue product of the third worker is $5.00 per hour, of
the fourth worker is only $2.50, and so on.
Figure 10.1 graphs the data from Table 10.1. Notice that the marginal revenue product curve
has the same downward slope as the marginal product curve but that MRP is measured in dollars,
not units of output. The MRP curve shows the dollar value of labor’s marginal product.

as long as MRPL is greater than

thetical firm will demand
210 units of labor.
Labor Markets
Let us begin our discussion of input markets by discussing a firm that uses only one variable fac-
tor of production.
A Firm Using Only One Variable Factor of Production: Labor
Demand for an input depends on that input’s marginal revenue product and its unit cost, or price.
The price of labor, for example, is the wage determined in the labor market. (At this point, we are
continuing to assume that the sandwich shop uses only one variable factor of production—labor.
Remember that competitive firms are price-takers in both output and input markets. Such firms
can hire all the labor they want to hire as long as they pay the market wage.) We can think of the
hourly wage at the sandwich shop as the marginal cost of a unit of labor. A profit-maximizing
firm will add inputs—in the case of labor, it will hire workers—as long as the marginal revenue
product of that input exceeds the market price of that input—in the case of labor, the wage.
Look again at the figures for the sandwich shop in Table 10.1,column 5.Now suppose the going
wage for sandwich makers is $4 per hour. A profit-maximizing firm would hire three workers. The
first worker would yield $5 per hour in revenue, and the second would yield $7.50, but they each
would cost only $4 per hour. The third worker would bring in $5 per hour, but still cost only $4 in
marginal wages. The marginal product of the fourth worker, however, would not bring in enough
revenue ($2.50) to pay this worker’s salary. Total profit is thus maximized by hiring three workers.
Figure 10.2 presents this same concept graphically. The labor market appears in Figure 10.2(a);
Figure 10.2(b) shows a single firm that employs workers. This firm, incidentally, does not represent
just the firms in a single industry. Because firms in many different industries demand labor, the rep-
resentative firm in Figure 10.2(b) represents any firm in any industry that uses labor.
The firm faces a market wage rate of $10. We can think of this as the marginal cost of a unit of
labor. (Note that we are now discussing the margin in units of labor; in previous chapters, we talked
about marginal units of output.) Given a wage of $10, how much labor would the firm demand?
You might think that the firm would hire 100 units, the point at which the difference between
marginal revenue product and wage rate is greatest.However,the firm is interested in maximizing total
profit,not marginal profit.Hiring the 101st unit of labor generates $20 in revenue at a cost of only $10.
Because MRPL is greater than the cost of the input required to produce it, hiring 1 more unit of labor
adds to profit.This will continue to be true as long as MRPL remains above $10,which is all the way to
210 units.At that point,the wage rate is equal to the marginal revenue product of labor,or W* = MRPL
= 10. The firm will not demand labor beyond 210 units because the cost of hiring the 211th unit
of labor would be greater than the value of what that unit produces. (Recall that the fourth sandwich
maker,requiring a wage of $4 per hour,can produce only an extra $2.50 an hour in sandwiches.)

220
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
Thus, the curve in Figure 10.2(b) tells us how much labor a firm that uses only one variable
factor of production will hire at each potential market wage rate. If the market wage falls, the
quantity of labor demanded will rise. If the market wage rises, the quantity of labor demanded will
fall. This description should sound familiar to you—it is, in fact, the description of a demand
curve. Therefore we can now say that when a firm uses only one variable factor of production, that
factor’s marginal revenue product curve is the firm’s demand curve for that factor in the short run.
Comparing Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost to Maximize Profits
In
Chapter 8, we saw that a competitive firm’s marginal cost curve is the same as its supply curve.
That is, at any output price, the marginal cost curve determines how much output a profit-
maximizing firm will produce. We came to this conclusion by comparing the marginal revenue
that a firm would earn by producing one more unit of output with the marginal cost of produc-
ing that unit of output.
There is no difference between the reasoning in Chapter 8 and the reasoning in this chapter.
The only difference is that what is being measured at the margin has changed. In Chapter 8, the
firm was comparing the marginal revenues and costs of producing another unit of output. Here the
firm is comparing the marginal revenues and costs of employing another unit of input. To see this
similarity, look at Figure 10.3. When the only variable factor of production is labor, the condition
W = MRPL is the same condition as P = MC. The two statements say exactly the same thing.
In both cases, the firm is comparing the cost of production with potential revenues from the
sale of product at the margin. In Chapter 8, the firm compared the price of output (P, which is
equal to MR in perfect competition) directly with cost of production (MC), where cost was
derived from information on factor prices and technology. (Review the derivation of cost curves
in Chapter 8 if this is unclear.) Here information on output price and technology is contained in
the marginal revenue product curve, which the firm compares with information on input price to
determine the optimal level of input to demand.
The assumption of one variable factor of production makes the trade-off facing firms easy to
see. Figure 10.4 shows that, in essence, firms weigh the value of labor as reflected in the market
wage against the value of the product of labor as reflected in the price of output. Assuming that
labor is the only variable input, if society values a good more than it costs firms to hire the work-
ers to produce that good, the good will be produced. In general, the same logic also holds for
more than one input. Firms weigh the value of outputs as reflected in output price against the
value of inputs as reflected in marginal costs.
Deriving Input Demands
For the small sandwich shop, calculating the marginal product of
a variable input (labor) and marginal revenue product was easy. Although it may be more complex,
the decision process is essentially the same for both big corporations and small proprietorships.
When an airline hires more flight attendants, for example, it increases the quality of its ser-
vice to attract more passengers and thus to sell more of its product. In deciding how many flight
attendants to hire, the airline must figure out how much new revenue the added attendants are
likely to generate relative to their wages.

CHAPTER 10
Input Demand: The Labor and Land Markets 221
At the sandwich shop, diminishing returns set in at a certain point. The same holds true for
an airplane. Once a sufficient number of attendants are on a plane, additional attendants add lit-
tle to the quality of service, and beyond a certain level, they might even give rise to negative mar-
ginal product. The presence of too many attendants could bother the passengers and make it
difficult to get to the restrooms.
In making your own decisions, you also compare marginal gains with input costs in the pres-
ence of diminishing returns. Suppose you grow vegetables in your yard. First, you save money at
the supermarket. Second, you can plant what you like, and the vegetables taste better fresh from
the garden. Third, you simply like to work in the garden.
Like the sandwich shop and the airline, you also face diminishing returns. You have only
625 square feet of garden to work with, and with land as a fixed factor in the short run, your mar-
ginal product will certainly decline. You can work all day every day, but your limited space will
produce only so many string beans. The first few hours you spend each week watering, fertilizing,
and dealing with major weed and bug infestations probably have a high marginal product.
However, after 5 or 6 hours, there is little else you can do to increase yield. Diminishing returns
also apply to your sense of satisfaction. The farmers’ markets are now full of inexpensive fresh
produce that tastes nearly as good as yours. Once you have been out in the garden for a few hours,
the hot sun and hard work start to lose their charm. Although your gardening does not involve a
salary (unlike the sandwich shop and the airline, which pay out wages), the labor you supply has
a value that must be weighed. You must weigh the value of additional gardening time against
leisure and the other options available to you.
Less labor is likely to be employed as the cost of labor rises. If the competitive labor market
pushed the daily wage to $6 per hour, the sandwich shop would hire only two workers instead of
three (Table 10.1). If you suddenly became very busy at school, the opportunity cost of your time
would rise and you would probably devote fewer hours to gardening.
We have recently seen an example of what may seem to be an exception to the rule that work-
ers will be hired only if the revenues they generate are equal to or greater than their wages. Many
start-up companies pay salaries to workers before the companies begin to take in revenue. This
has been particularly true for Internet start-ups in recent years. How does a company pay work-
ers if it is not earning any revenue? The answer is that the entrepreneur (or the venture capital
fund supporting the entrepreneur) is betting that the firm will earn substantial revenue in the
future. Workers are hired because the entrepreneur expects that their current efforts will produce
future revenue greater than their wage costs.

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
A Firm Employing Two Variable Factors of Production in
the Short and Long Run
When a firm employs more than one variable factor of production, the analysis of input demand
becomes more complicated, but the principles stay the same. We shall now consider a firm that
employs variable capital (K) and labor (L) inputs and thus faces factor prices PK and PL.1 (Recall
that capital refers to plant, equipment, and inventory used in production. We assume that some
portion of the firm’s capital stock is fixed in the short run, but that some of it is variable—for
example, some machinery and equipment can be installed quickly.) Our analysis can be applied
to any two factors of production and can easily be generalized to three or more. It can also be
applied to the long run, when all factors of production are variable.
You have seen that inputs can be complementary or substitutable. Land, labor, and capital are
used together to produce outputs. The worker who uses a shovel digs a bigger hole than another
worker with no shovel. Add a steam shovel and that worker becomes even more productive. When
an expanding firm adds to its stock of capital, it raises the productivity of its labor, and vice versa.
Thus, each factor complements the other. At the same time, though, land, labor, and capital can
also be substituted for one another. If labor becomes expensive, some labor-saving technology—
robotics, for example—may take its place.
In firms employing just one variable factor of production, a change in the price of that factor
affects only the demand for the factor itself. When more than one factor can vary, however, we
must consider the impact of a change in one factor price on the demand for other factors as well.
Substitution and Output Effects of a Change in Factor Price
Table 10.2 pre-
sents data on a hypothetical firm that employs variable capital and labor. Suppose that the firm
faces a choice between two available technologies of production—technique A, which is capital
intensive, and technique B, which is labor intensive. When the market price of labor is $1 per
unit and the market price of capital is $1 per unit, the labor-intensive method of producing
output is less costly. Each unit costs only $13 to produce using technique B, while the unit cost
of production using technique A is $15. If the price of labor rises to $2, however, technique B is
no longer less costly. Labor has become more expensive relative to capital. The unit cost rises to
$23 for labor-intensive technique B, but to only $20 for capital-intensive technique A.

effect
The tendency of firms
to substitute away from a
factor whose price has risen
and toward a factor whose
price has fallen.
Table 10.3 shows the effect of such an increase in the price of labor on both capital and labor
demand when a firm produces 100 units of output. When the price of labor is $1 and the price of
capital is $1, the firm chooses technique B and demands 300 units of capital and 1,000 units of
labor. Total variable cost is $1,300. An increase in the price of labor to $2 causes the firm to switch
from technique B to technique A. In doing so, the firm substitutes capital for labor. The amount of
labor demanded drops from 1,000 to 500 units. The amount of capital demanded increases from
300 to 1,000 units, while total variable cost increases to $2,000.
The tendency of firms to substitute away from a factor whose relative price has risen and
toward a factor whose relative price has fallen is called the factor substitution effect. The factor
substitution effect is part of the reason that input demand curves slope downward. When an input,

between labor and capital.

or factor of production, becomes less expensive, firms tend to substitute it for other factors and
thus buy more of it. When a particular input becomes more expensive, firms tend to substitute
other factors and buy less of it.
The firm described in Table 10.2 and Table 10.3 continued to produce 100 units of output
after the wage rate doubled. An increase in the price of a production factor, however, also
means an increase in the costs of production. Notice that total variable cost increased from
$1,300 to $2,000. When a firm faces higher costs, it is likely to produce less in the short run.
When a firm decides to decrease output, its demand for all factors declines—including, of
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
What is Denzel Washington’s Marginal Revenue Product in
Broadway’s Fences?
Denzel Washington is well known for his movie performances,
where he has been paid as much as $20 million for a film. In the
spring and summer of 2010, Washington starred in August Wilson’s
Fences at the Cort Theater on Broadway in New York. How would we
go about estimating Washington’s marginal revenue product in that
job? What is the most the producers of Fences should be willing to
pay Washington?
In the case of Broadway theater, revenues come principally from
ticket revenues. The Cort Theater seats just over 1,000 people, and the
average ticket price is $110.Fences has eight performances a week.So the
total maximum weekly “gate,” as it is called in the theater, is $880,000
assuming the theater is fully sold out.How much of this should the pro-
ducers be willing to pay Washington to secure him in the role?
As with the sandwich workers, the key here is to figure out what
Washington adds to the gate. Given that all revenues come from
ticket sales, we really need to know how many more people
Washington can attract to the Cort Theater than could another
actor. Suppose the producer believed that Washington could
increase demand for tickets by 10 percent, so that instead of selling
half the theater's seats in a week, or 4,000 tickets, as is common for a
Broadway show, the theater sold 4,400 seats per week. That would
add $44,000 to the revenues over what would be achievable with
another actor. Moreover, in contrast to the sandwich shop,
Washington can add this revenue with no other added inputs; it
costs nothing more to play to a house three-fourths full than to one
half full. In this case, the producer should be willing to pay
Washington as much as $44,000 per week over a lesser actor.
Notice this salary is
considerably less than
Washington makes for
a movie. Movies take
about 3 months of act-
ing time. At $15 to 
$20 million for a
movie, that amounts
to well over $1 million
per week. Why should
Washington’s 
acting
have 
an 
MRP
of
$44,000 
per 
week
when on the stage and
$1 million per week
for a movie? We are
back to the principle
of
derived demand.
Washington’s MRP is
higher in movies than
in the live theater because the earnings potential of the former is
higher. Movie audiences are not limited to 1,000 per week;
Washington’s 2010 movie, Book of Eli, showed to more than
3 million people in its opening weekend, and most critics
thought that Washington was the primary audience draw. With
DVD sales in addition, it is easy to see how Washington’s MRP in
films might be quite high.

course, the factor whose price increased in the first place. This is called the output effect of a
factor price increase.
A decrease in the price of a factor of production, in contrast, means lower costs of produc-
tion. If their output price remains unchanged, firms will increase output. This, in turn, means
that demand for all factors of production will increase. This is the output effect of a factor
price decrease.
The output effect helps explain why input demand curves slope downward. Output effects
and factor substitution effects work in the same direction. Consider, for example, a decline in the
wage rate. Lower wages mean that a firm will substitute labor for capital and other inputs. Stated
somewhat differently, the factor substitution effect leads to an increase in the quantity of labor
demanded. Lower wages mean lower costs, and lower costs lead to more output. This increase in
output means that the firm will hire more of all factors of production, including labor. This is the
output effect of a factor price decrease. Notice that both effects lead to an increase in the quantity
demanded for labor when the wage rate falls.
Many Labor Markets
Although Figure 10.1 depicts “the labor market,” many labor markets exist. There is a market for
baseball players, for carpenters, for chemists, for college professors, and for unskilled workers. Still
other markets exist for taxi drivers, assembly-line workers, secretaries, and corporate executives.
Each market has a set of skills associated with it and a supply of people with the requisite skills. If
labor markets are competitive, the wages in those markets are determined by the interaction of
supply and demand. As we have seen, firms will hire additional workers only as long as the value
of their product exceeds the relevant market wage. This is true in all competitive labor markets.
Land Markets
Unlike labor and capital, land has a special feature that we have not yet considered: It is in strictly
fixed (perfectly inelastic) supply in total. The only real questions about land thus center around
how much it is worth and how it will be used.
Because land is fixed in supply, we say that its price is demand determined. In other words,
the price of land is determined exclusively by what households and firms are willing to pay for it.
The return to any factor of production in fixed supply is called a pure rent.
Thinking of the price of land as demand determined can be confusing because all land is not
the same. Some land is clearly more valuable than other land. What lies behind these differences?
As with any other factor of production, land will presumably be sold or rented to the user who is
willing to pay the most for it. The value of land to a potential user may depend on the character-
istics of the land or on its location. For example, more fertile land should produce more farm
products per acre and thus command a higher price than less fertile land. A piece of property
located at the intersection of two highways may be of great value as a site for a gas station because
of the volume of traffic that passes the intersection daily.
A numerical example may help to clarify our discussion. Consider the potential uses of a cor-
ner lot in a suburb of Kansas City. Alan wants to build a clothing store on the lot. He anticipates
that he can earn economic profits of $10,000 per year because of the land’s excellent location.
Bella, another person interested in buying the corner lot, believes that she can earn $35,000 per
year in economic profit if she builds a pharmacy there.Because of the higher profit that she expects
to earn, Bella will be able to outbid Alan, and the landowner will sell (or rent) to the highest bidder.
Because location is often the key to profits, landowners are frequently able to “squeeze” their
renters. One of the most popular locations in the Boston area, for example, is Harvard Square.
There are dozens of restaurants in and around the square, and most of them are full a good deal
of the time. Despite this seeming success, most Harvard Square restaurant owners are not getting
rich. Why? Because they must pay very high rents on the location of their restaurants. A substan-
tial portion of each restaurant’s revenues goes to rent the land that (by virtue of its scarcity) is the
key to unlocking those same revenues.
Although Figure 10.5 shows that the supply of land is perfectly inelastic (a vertical line), the
supply of land in a given use may not be perfectly inelastic or fixed. Think, for example, about

When a

Because land in general (and

farmland available for housing developments. As a city’s population grows, housing developers
find themselves willing to pay more for land. As land becomes more valuable for development,
some farmers sell out, and the supply of land available for development increases. This analysis
would lead us to draw an upward-sloping supply curve (not a perfectly inelastic supply curve) for
land in the land-for-development category.
Nonetheless, our major point—that land earns a pure rent—is still valid. The supply of land
of a given quality at a given location is truly fixed in supply. Its value is determined exclusively by
the amount that the highest bidder is willing to pay for it. Because land cannot be reproduced,
supply is perfectly inelastic.
Rent and the Value of Output Produced on Land
Because the price of land is demand determined, rent depends on what the potential users of the
land are willing to pay for it. As we have seen, land will end up being used by whoever is willing to
pay the most for it. What determines this willingness to pay? Let us now connect our discussion
of land markets with our earlier discussions of factor markets in general.
As our example of two potential users bidding for a plot of land shows, the bids depend on the
land’s potential for profit.Alan’s plan would generate $10,000 a year; Bella’s would generate $35,000
a year. Nevertheless, these profits do not just materialize. Instead, they come from producing and
selling an output that is valuable to households. Land in a popular downtown location is expensive
because of what can be produced on it. Note that land is needed as an input into the production of
nearly all goods and services. A restaurant located next to a popular theater can charge a premium
price because it has a relatively captive clientele. The restaurant must produce a quality product to
stay in business, but the location alone provides a substantial profit opportunity.
It should come as no surprise that the demand for land follows the same rules as the
demand for inputs in general. A profit-maximizing firm will employ an additional factor of
production as long as its marginal revenue product exceeds its market price. For example, a
profit-maximizing firm will hire labor as long as the revenue earned from selling labor’s prod-
uct is sufficient to cover the cost of hiring additional labor—which for perfectly competitive
firms, equals the wage rate. The same thing is true for land. A firm will pay for and use land as
long as the revenue earned from selling the product produced on that land is sufficient to cover
the price of the land. Stated in equation form, the firm will use land up to the point at which
MRPA = PA, where A is land (acres).
Just as the demand curve for labor reflects the value of labor’s product as determined in out-
put markets, so the demand for land depends on the value of land’s product in output markets.
The profitability of the restaurant located next to the theater results from the fact that the meals
produced there command a price in the marketplace.

226
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
The allocation of a given plot of land among competing uses thus depends on the trade-off
between competing products that can be produced there. Agricultural land becomes developed
when its value in producing housing or manufactured goods (or providing space for a mini-
mall) exceeds its value in producing crops. A corner lot in Kansas City becomes the site of a
pharmacy instead of a clothing store because the people in that neighborhood have a greater
need for a pharmacy.
One final word about land: Because land cannot be moved physically, the value of any one
parcel depends to a large extent on the uses to which adjoining parcels are put. A factory belching
acrid smoke will probably reduce the value of adjoining land, while a new highway that increases
accessibility may enhance it.
The Firm’s Profit-Maximizing Condition in
Input Markets
Thus far, we have discussed the labor and land markets in some detail. Although we will put
off a detailed discussion of capital until the next chapter, it is now possible to generalize about
competitive demand for factors of production. Every firm has an incentive to use variable
inputs as long as the revenue generated by those inputs covers the costs of those inputs at the
margin. More formally, firms will employ each input up to the point that its price equals its
marginal revenue product. This condition holds for all factors at all levels of output.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Time Is Money: European High-Speed Trains
In the past few years, many parts of Europe have invested in high-
speed trains. In the article that follows, we see the way in which these
trains increase land value. The rise in land value following the intro-
duction of high-speed trains is another example of the importance
of the opportunity cost of time. As train speeds increase, the time
cost of living far from one’s workplace decreases; the natural result is
an increased willingness to live far from one’s workplace and thus an
increase in outlying land values.

Travel Industry News
While air travelers put up with longer delays, cancelled flights
and tedious security procedures, and drivers face rising gas
prices and ever-increasing congestion, life keeps getting
easier for passengers on Europe’s expanding network of
high-speed trains. The latest developments and the far-
reaching benefits of high-speed European train travel were
the topics of a press conference, “High-speed trains:
Changing the European Experience” held in New York today.
Speakers included: CEO of the French National Railroads
(SNCF), Guillaume Pepy; Commercial Director of the
Eurostar train, Nicholas Mercer; and High-Speed Director 
of the Paris-based International Railway Association (UIC), 
Inaki Barron. Rail Europe—North America’s leading seller of
European rail travel—was the host of the conference.
Traveling at speed of 150 mph or higher (compared to reg-
ular trains going 100 mph or less), high-speed trains currently
run on 3,034 miles of track in 10 European countries. By
2010, another 1,711 miles are scheduled to be in operation,
and there are plans beyond that to add on average 346 miles
each year through 2020, according to the UIC’s Barron.
High-speed trains not only benefit travelers and the envi-
ronment, they also boost the economies of communities
served. In France, they call it the “TGV effect”—increases in
property values, rents/real estate prices and number of
jobs/businesses in towns in or near high-speed rail lines.
Real estate prices in Avignon rose more than 30% in the
first three years following the launch of TGV Mediterranean. In
Vendome, near the TGV Atlantique line (Paris-Tours in the
Loire region) real estate prices went up 50% in five years.

CHAPTER 10
Input Demand: The Labor and Land Markets 227
The profit-maximizing condition for the perfectly competitive firm is
where L is labor, K is capital, A is land (acres), X is output, and PX is the price of that output.
When all these conditions are met, the firm will be using the optimal, or least costly, combina-
tion of inputs. If all the conditions hold at the same time, it is possible to rewrite them another way:
Your intuition tells you much the same thing that these equations do: The marginal product of the
last dollar spent on labor must be equal to the marginal product of the last dollar spent on capital,
which must be equal to the marginal product of the last dollar spent on land, and so on. If this was
not the case, the firm could produce more with less and reduce cost. Suppose, for example, that
MPL/PL > MPK/PK. In this situation, the firm can produce more output by shifting dollars out of
capital and into labor. Hiring more labor drives down the marginal product of labor, and using less
capital increases the marginal product of capital.This means that the ratios come back to equality as
the firm shifts out of capital and into labor.
So far,we have used very general terms to discuss the nature of input demand by firms in compet-
itive markets, where input prices and output prices are taken as given. The most important point is
that demand for a factor depends on the value that the market places on its marginal product.2The rest
of this chapter explores the forces that determine the shapes and positions of input demand curves.
Input Demand Curves
In Chapter 5, we considered the factors that influence the responsiveness, or elasticity, of output
demand curves. We have not yet talked about input demand curves in any detail, however, so we
now need to say more about what lies behind them.
Shifts in Factor Demand Curves
Factor (input) demand curves are derived from information on technology—that is, production
functions—and output price (see Figure 10.4 on p. 221). A change in the demand for outputs, a
change in the quantity of complementary or substitutable inputs, changes in the prices of other
inputs, and technological change all can cause factor demand curves to shift. These shifts in
demand are important because they directly affect the allocation of resources among alternative
uses as well as the level and distribution of income.
The Demand for Outputs
A firm will demand an input as long as its marginal revenue
product exceeds its market price. Marginal revenue product, which in perfect competition is equal to
a factor’s marginal product times the price of output, is the value of the factor’s marginal product:
MRPL = MPL  PX
The amount that a firm is willing to pay for a factor of production depends directly on the
value of the things the firm produces. It follows that if product demand increases, product price
will rise and marginal revenue product (factor demand) will increase—the MRP curve will shift
to the right. If product demand declines, product price will fall and marginal revenue product
(factor demand) will decrease—the MRP curve will shift to the left.

Go back and raise the price of sandwiches from $0.50 to $1.00 in the sandwich shop example
examined in Table 10.1 on p. 216 to see that this is so.
To the extent that any input is used intensively in the production of some product, changes in the
demand for that product cause factor demand curves to shift and the prices of those inputs to change.
Land prices are a good example. Forty years ago, the area in Manhattan along the west side of Central
Park from about 80th Street north was a run-down neighborhood full of abandoned houses. The
value of land there was virtually zero. During the mid-1980s, increased demand for housing caused
rents to hit record levels.Some single-room apartments,for example,rented for as much as $1,400 per
month. With the higher price of output (rent), input prices increased substantially. By 2008, small 
one-bedroom apartments on 80th Street and Central Park West sold for well over $500,000, and the
value of the land figures very importantly in these prices. In essence, a shift in demand for an output
(housing in the area) pushed up the marginal revenue product of land from zero to very high levels.
The Quantity of Complementary and Substitutable Inputs
In our discussion
thus far, we have kept coming back to the fact that factors of production complement one
another. The productivity of, and thus the demand for, any one factor of production depends on
the quality and quantity of the other factors with which it works.
The effect of capital accumulation on wages is one of the most important themes in all of eco-
nomics. In general, the production and use of capital enhances the productivity of labor and nor-
mally increases the demand for labor and drives up wages. Consider as an example transportation.In
a poor country such as Bangladesh, one person with an ox cart can move a small load over bad roads
veryslowly.Bycontrast,thestockof capitalusedbyworkersinthetransportationindustryintheUnited
States is enormous.A truck driver in the United States works with a substantial amount of capital. The
typical 18-wheel tractor trailer, for example, is a piece of capital worth over $100,000. The roads them-
selves are capital that was put in place by the government. The amount of material that a single driver
can move between distant points in a short time is staggering relative to what it was just 50 years ago.
The Prices of Other Inputs
When a firm has a choice among alternative technologies,
the choice it makes depends to some extent on relative input prices. You saw in Table 10.2 on
p. 222 and Table 10.3 on p. 223 that an increase in the price of labor substantially increased the
demand for capital as the firm switched to a more capital-intensive production technique.
During the 1970s, the large increase in energy prices relative to prices of other factors of produc-
tion had a number of effects on the demand for those other inputs. Insulation of new buildings,
installation of more efficient heating plants, and similar efforts substantially raised the demand for
capital as capital was substituted for energy in production.It has also been argued that the energy cri-
sis led to an increase in demand for labor. If capital and energy are complementary inputs—that is, if
technologies that are capital-intensive are also energy-intensive—the argument goes, the higher
energy prices tended to push firms away from capital-intensive techniques toward more labor-
intensive techniques.A new highly automated technique,for example,might need fewer workers,but
it would also require a vast amount of electricity to operate. High electricity prices could lead a firm
to reject the new techniques and stick with an old, more labor-intensive method of production.
Technological Change
Closely related to the impact of capital accumulation on factor
demand is the potential impact of technological change—that is,the introduction of new methods of
production or new products. New technologies usually introduce ways to produce outputs with fewer
inputs by increasing the productivity of existing inputs or by raising marginal products. Because mar-
ginal revenue product reflects productivity, increases in productivity directly shift input demand
curves. If the marginal product of labor rises, for example, the demand for labor shifts to the right
(increases). Technological change can and does have a powerful influence on factor demands. As new
products and new techniques of production are born, so are demands for new inputs and new skills.
As old products become obsolete, so do the labor skills and other inputs needed to produce them.
Looking Ahead
We now have a complete, but simplified picture of household and firm decision making. We have
also examined some of the basic forces that determine the allocation of resources and the mix of
output in perfectly competitive markets.

CHAPTER 10
Input Demand: The Labor and Land Markets 229
In this competitive environment, profit-maximizing firms make three fundamental deci-
sions: (1) how much to produce and supply in output markets, (2) how to produce (which tech-
nology to use), and (3) how much of each input to demand. Chapters 7 through 9 looked at these
three decisions from the perspective of the output market. We derived the supply curve of a com-
petitive firm in the short run and discussed output market adjustment in the long run. Deriving
cost curves, we learned, involves evaluating and choosing among alternative technologies. Finally,
we saw how a firm’s decision about how much product to supply in output markets implicitly
determines input demands. Input demands, we argued, are also derived demands. That is, they
are ultimately linked to the demand for output.
To show the connection between output and input markets, this chapter took these same
three decisions and examined them from the perspective of input markets. Firms hire up to the
point at which each input’s marginal revenue product is equal to its price.
The next chapter takes up the complexity of what we have been loosely calling the “capital
market.” There we discuss the relationship between the market for physical capital and financial
capital markets and look at some of the ways that firms make investment decisions. Once we
examine the nature of overall competitive equilibrium in Chapter 12, we can finally begin relax-
ing some of the assumptions that have restricted the scope of our inquiry—most importantly, the
assumption of perfect competition in input and output markets.
S U M M A R Y
1. The same set of decisions that lies behind output supply
curves also lies behind input demand curves. Only the per-
spective is different.
INPUT MARKETS: BASIC CONCEPTS p. 215
2. Demand for inputs depends on demand for the outputs that
they produce; input demand is thus a derived demand.
Productivity is a measure of the amount of output produced
per unit of input.
3. In general, firms will demand workers as long as the value of
what those workers produce exceeds what they must be
paid. Households will supply labor as long as the wage
exceeds the value of leisure or the value that they derive
from nonpaid work.
4. Inputs are at the same time complementary and substitutable.
5. In the short run, some factor of production is fixed. This means
that all firms encounter diminishing returns in the short run.
Stated somewhat differently, diminishing returns means that all
firms encounter declining marginal product in the short run.
6. The marginal revenue product (MRP) of a variable input is
the additional revenue a firm earns by employing one addi-
tional unit of the input, ceteris paribus. MRP is equal to the
input’s marginal product times the price of output.
LABOR MARKETS p. 219 
7. Demand for an input depends on that input’s marginal revenue
product. Profit-maximizing perfectly competitive firms will buy
an input (for example, hire labor) up to the point where the
input’s marginal revenue product equals its price. For a firm
employing only one variable factor of production, the MRP
curve is the firm’s demand curve for that factor in the short run.
8. For a perfectly competitive firm employing one variable fac-
tor of production, labor, the condition W = MRPL is exactly
the same as the condition P = MC. Firms weigh the value of
outputs as reflected in output price against the value of
inputs as reflected in marginal costs.
9. When a firm employs two variable factors of production, a
change in factor price has both a factor substitution effect and
an output effect.
10. A wage increase may lead a firm to substitute capital for labor
and thus cause the quantity demanded of labor to decline.
This is the factor substitution effect of the wage increase.
11. A wage increase increases cost, and higher cost may lead to
lower output and less demand for all inputs, including labor.
This is the output effect of the wage increase. The effect is the
opposite for a wage decrease.
LAND MARKETS p. 224 
12. Because land is in strictly fixed supply, its price is demand
determined—that is, its price is determined exclusively by
what households and firms are willing to pay for it. The
return to any factor of production in fixed supply is called
a pure rent. A firm will pay for and use land as long as the
revenue earned from selling the product produced on that
land is sufficient to cover the price of the land. The firm
will use land up to the point at which MRPA = PA, where 
A is land (acres).
THE FIRM’S PROFIT-MAXIMIZING CONDITION IN
INPUT MARKETS p. 226 
13. Every firm has an incentive to use variable inputs as long as
the revenue generated by those inputs covers the costs of
those inputs at the margin. Therefore, firms will employ
each input up to the point that its price equals its marginal
revenue product. This profit-maximizing condition holds
for all factors at all levels of output.
INPUT DEMAND CURVES p. 227 
14. A shift in a firm’s demand curve for a factor of production
can be influenced by the demand for the firm’s product, the
quantity of complementary and substitutable inputs, the
prices of other inputs, and changes in technology.

If apples sell for $2 per bushel and workers can be hired in a
competitive labor market for $30 per day, how many workers
should be hired? What if workers unionized and the wage
rose to $50? (Hint: Create marginal product and marginal
revenue product columns for the table.) Explain your
answers clearly.
5. The following graph is the production function for a firm using
only one variable factor of production, labor.
a. Graph the marginal product of labor for the firm as a func-
tion of the number of labor units hired.
b. Assuming the price of output, PX, is equal to $6, graph the
firm’s marginal revenue product schedule as a function of
the number of labor units hired.
c. If the current equilibrium wage rate is $4 per hour, how
many hours of labor will you hire? How much output will
you produce?

3. During the two decades leading up to the new millennium,
wage inequality in the United States increased substantially.
That is, high-income workers saw their salaries increase sub-
stantially while wages of lower-income workers stagnated or
even fell. Using the logic of marginal revenue product, give an
explanation for this change in the distribution of income. In
your explanation, you may want to consider the rise of the high-
technology, high-skill sector and the decline of industries
requiring low-skill labor.
1. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average weekly
earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees in edu-
cation and health services was $638 in January 2010, up from
$440 in January 2000. All else equal, such an increase in wages
would be expected to reduce the demand for labor and
employment should fall. Instead, the quantity demanded for
labor has increased dramatically with more than 4 million jobs
being created between 2000 and 2010. How can you explain
this seeming discrepancy?

$1,577,600. How can a non-profit organization like the Boy
Scouts justify compensating its chief executive at a similar
level to the CEO of a successful for-profit company like
Harley-Davidson?

17. The price of land is said to be “demand-determined.”

18. Houston, Texas, is the only major U.S. city with virtually no
zoning laws. This means that single-family homes, apartment
buildings, shopping centers, high-rise buildings, and industrial
complexes can all be built in the same neighborhood. Of the
major U.S. cities, Houston was also one of the least impacted by
the housing market crisis of 2008. In 2009, Houston issued
42,697 building permits and was the top-ranked city in the list
of healthiest housing markets. How might the lack of zoning
laws have played a part in Houston's healthy housing and build-
ing markets?

6. Describe how each of the following events would affect
(1) demand for construction workers and (2) construction wages
in Portland, Oregon. Illustrate with supply and demand curves.
a. A sharp increase in interest rates on new-home mortgages
reduces the demand for new houses substantially.
b. The economy of the area booms. Office rents rise, creating
demand for new office space.
c. A change in the tax laws in 2010 made real estate develop-
ments more profitable. As a result, three major developers
start planning to build major shopping centers.
7. The demand for land is a derived demand. Think of a popular
location near your school. What determines the demand for
land in that area? What outputs are sold by businesses located
there? Discuss the relationship between land prices and the
prices of those products.
8. Many states provide firms with an “investment tax credit” that
effectively reduces the price of capital. In theory, these credits
are designed to stimulate new investment and thus create jobs.
Critics have argued that if there are strong factor substitution
effects, these subsidies could reduce employment in the state.
Explain their arguments.
9. Doug’s farm in Idaho has four major fields that he uses to grow
potatoes. The productivity of each field follows:
ANNUAL YIELD, HUNDREDS OF POUNDS
Field 1
10,000
Field 2
8,000
Field 3
5,000
Field 4
3,000
Assume that each field is the same size and that the variable
costs of farming are $25,000 per year per field. The variable
costs cover labor and machinery time, which is rented.
Doug must decide each year how many fields to plant. In
2009, potato farmers received $6.35 per 100 pounds. How
many fields did Doug plant? Explain. By 2011, the price of
potatoes had fallen to $4.50 per 100 pounds. How will this
price decrease change Doug’s decision? How will it affect his
demand for labor? How will it affect the value of Doug’s land?
10. Assume that you are living in a house with two other people and
that the house has a big lawn that must be mowed. One of your
roommates, who dislikes working outdoors, suggests hiring a
neighbor’s daughter to mow the grass for $40 per week instead
of sharing the work and doing it yourselves. How would you go
about deciding who will mow the lawn? What factors would you
raise in deciding? What are the trade-offs here?

and labor as substitutable resources in the production of
shirts, and the price of capital used by Sunshine has just
decreased. What do the substitution and output effects suggest
will happen to the demand for capital and the demand for
labor at Sunshine?
20. For a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal cost curve
determines how much output a profit-maximizing firm will
produce. For input markets, the marginal revenue product
curve determines how much labor a profit-maximizing firm
will hire in a perfectly competitive labor market. Explain how
the reasoning behind these two concepts is related.
21. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 217] Each year in
New Orleans, Carnival season begins on January 6 and culmi-

Gras. This wildly popular celebration attracts people from
around the world, and the city of New Orleans estimates that
over half a million visitors attended the festivities in 2010. The
Tuesday on which Mardi Gras falls each year has been declared
a state holiday in Louisiana, with banks, post offices, and many
private businesses closing for the day. On the basis of labor,
explain why you think Mardi Gras has been declared a state
holiday in Louisiana and why so many businesses in New
Orleans are closed on that day.

In Chapter 10 we explored the labor and
land markets in some detail. In this chapter,
we consider the capital market more fully.
Transactions between households and firms
in the labor and land markets are direct. In
the labor market, households offer their
labor directly to firms in exchange for
wages. In the land market, landowners rent
or sell their land directly to firms in
exchange for rent or an agreed-to price. In
the capital market, though, households
often indirectly
supply the financial
resources necessary for firms to purchase
capital. When households save and add
funds to their bank accounts, for example, firms can borrow those funds from the bank to finance
their capital purchases.
The importance of the movement of capital from individuals to firms in a market economy
cannot be overemphasized. For firms to enter new industries or produce new products, capital is
required. In market capitalist systems, decisions about which enterprises to support via capital is
made by private citizens seeking private gain. The Economics in Practice on p. 235 describes this
process for one firm, Tesla, maker of electric cars. These decisions are risky—it is hard to know
which new firms will succeed and which will fail. Understanding the institutions through which
capital flows from households to firms is the subject of this chapter.
Capital, Investment, and Depreciation
Before we proceed with our analysis of the capital market, we need to review some basic eco-
nomic principles and introduce some related concepts.
Capital
One of the most important concepts in all of economics is the concept of capital. Capital goods
are those goods produced by the economic system that are used as inputs to produce other goods
and services in the future. Capital goods thus yield valuable productive services over time. The
value of capital is only as great as the value of the services it renders over time.
Tangible Capital
When we think of capital, we generally think of the physical, material capi-
tal employed by firms. The major categories of physical, or tangible, capital are (1) nonresidential
structures (for example, office buildings, power plants, factories, shopping centers, warehouses, and
docks) (2) durable equipment (for example, machines, trucks, sandwich grills, and automobiles),
(3) residential structures, and (4) inventories of inputs and outputs that firms have in stock.
Most firms need tangible capital, along with labor and land, to produce their products. A
restaurant’s capital requirements include a kitchen, ovens and grills, tables and chairs, silverware,
dishes, and light fixtures. These items must be purchased up front and maintained if the restau-
rant is to function properly. A manufacturing firm must have a plant, specialized machinery,

Material things used as inputs
in the production of future
goods and services. The major
categories of physical capital
are nonresidential structures,
durable equipment, residential
structures, and inventories.

trucks, and inventories of parts. A winery needs casks, vats, piping, temperature-control equip-
ment, and cooking and bottling machinery.
The capital stock of a retail pharmacy is made up mostly of inventories. Pharmacies do not
produce the aspirin, vitamins, and toothbrushes that they sell. Instead, they buy those items
from manufacturers and put them on display. The product actually produced and sold by a
pharmacy is convenience. Like any other product, convenience is produced with labor and cap-
ital in the form of a store with many products, or inventory, displayed on the sales floor and
kept in storerooms. The inventories of inputs and outputs that manufacturing firms maintain
are also capital. To function smoothly and meet the demands of buyers, for example, the Ford
Motor Company maintains inventories of both auto parts (tires, windshields, and so on) and
completed cars.
An apartment building is also capital. Produced by the economic system, it yields valuable
services over time and it is used as an input to produce housing services, which are rented.
Social Capital: Infrastructure
Some physical or tangible capital is owned by the public
instead of by private firms. Social capital, sometimes called infrastructure, is capital that pro-
vides services to the public. Most social capital takes the form of public works such as highways,
roads, bridges, mass transit systems, and sewer and water systems. Police stations, fire stations,
city halls, courthouses, and police cars are all forms of social capital that are used as inputs to pro-
duce the services that government provides.
All firms use some forms of social capital in producing their outputs. Recent economic
research has shown that a country’s infrastructure plays a very important role in helping
private firms produce their products efficiently. When public capital is not properly cared
for—for example, when roads deteriorate or when airports are not modernized to accom-
modate increasing traffic—private firms that depend on efficient transportation net-
works suffer.
Intangible Capital
Not all capital is physical. Some things that are intangible (nonmater-
ial) satisfy every part of our definition of capital. When a firm invests in advertising to establish a
brand name, it is producing a form of intangible capital called goodwill. This goodwill yields
valuable services to the firm over time.
When a firm establishes a training program for employees, it is investing in its workers’ skills.
We can think of such an investment as the production of an intangible form of capital called
human capital. It is produced with labor (instructors) and capital (classrooms, computers, pro-
jectors, and books). Human capital in the form of new or augmented skills is an input—it will
yield valuable productive services for the firm in the future.
When research produces valuable results, such as a new production process that reduces
costs or a new formula that creates a new product, the new technology can be considered capital.
Furthermore, even ideas can be patented and the rights to them can be sold.
A large number of “new economy” start-up technology companies have responded to
the growth of the Internet. These dot-com and e-commerce companies generally start with
limited capital, and most of that capital is in the skills and knowledge of their employees:
human capital.
Measuring Capital
Labor is measured in hours, and land is measured in square feet or
acres. Because capital comes in so many forms, it is virtually impossible to measure it
directly in physical terms. The indirect measure generally used is current market value. The
measure of a firm’s capital stock is the current market value of its plant, equipment, inven-
tories, and intangible assets. By using value as a measuring stick, business managers, accoun-
tants, and economists can, in a sense, add buildings, barges, and bulldozers into a measure of
total capital.
Capital is measured as a stock value. That is, it is measured at a point in time: The capital
stock of the XYZ Corporation on July 31, 2007, is $3,453,231. According to Department of
Commerce estimates, the capital stock of the U.S. economy in 2008 (in 2005 dollars) was about
$44.2 trillion. Of that amount, $17.1 trillion was residential structures; $8.1 trillion was owned by
the federal, state, and local governments (for example, aircraft carriers and school buildings); and
$6.3 trillion was equipment and software.

CHAPTER 11
Input Demand: The Capital Market and the Investment Decision 235
Although it is measured in terms of money, or value, it is very important to think of the actual
capital stock. When we speak of capital, we refer not to money or to financial assets such as bonds
and stocks, but instead to the firm’s physical plant, equipment, inventory, and intangible assets.
Investment and Depreciation
Recall the difference between stock and flow measures discussed in earlier chapters.Stock measures are
valued at a particular point in time, whereas flow measures are valued over a period of time. The eas-
iest way to think of the difference between a stock and a flow is to think about a tub of water.The vol-
ume of water in the tub is measured at a point in time and is a stock.The amount of water that flows
into the tub per hour and the amount of water that evaporates out of the tub per day are flow mea-
sures. Flow measures have meaning only when the time dimension is added. Water flowing into the
tub at a rate of 5 gallons per hour is very different from water flowing at a rate of 5 gallons per year.
Capital stocks are affected over time by two flows: investment and depreciation. When a firm
produces or puts in place new capital—a new piece of equipment, for example—it has invested.
Investment is a flow that increases the stock of capital. Because it has a time dimension, we speak
of investment per period (by the month, quarter, or year).
As you proceed, keep in mind that the term investing is not used in economics to describe the
act of buying a share of stock or a bond.Although people commonly use the term this way (“I invested
in some Union Carbide stock” or “he invested in Treasury bonds”), the term investment when
used correctly refers only to an increase in capital.

additions to a firm’s capital
stock. Although capital is
measured at a given point in
time (a stock), investment is
measured over a period of time
(a flow). The flow of
investment increases the
capital stock.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Investment Banking, IPOs, and Electric Cars
Automobile production is, as we noted in Chapter 9, subject to
economies of scale. Becoming a new car manufacturer requires con-
siderable capital, well beyond what most individuals can put
together. In the summer of 2010 Tesla Motors, a new electric car
manufacturer, turned to the public to seek capital.
How did Tesla do this? Tesla decided to become a public company,
with shares offered to the public on a stock exchange. The process of
doing this is called an IPO (initial public offering). As the article
indicates, Tesla initially offered the public 13.3 million shares, each
for a price of $17, for a total increase in capital for the firm of
$226 million. In mounting its IPO Tesla, like most other firms, relied
on investment banks to help figure out the right price and manage
the sales. In Tesla’s case a number of firms were involved, including
Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley. Managing IPOs is
one of the functions of investment banks, as they help move capital
from households to entrepreneurs with new ideas.
TSLA: What Does Tesla’s IPO Mean for the
Future of Electric Cars?
The Wall Street Journal
Tesla Motors today became the first American car company
to make an initial public offering since Ford did so in 1956.
And one could argue the sleek, fast Tesla Roadster the com-
pany has been selling is in some ways a bit like Ford’s old
Model T, which revolutionized assembly-line manufacturing.
Tesla seems poised to be part of the redefinition of the way
we drive. After all, the Palo Alto, California, electric-car maker
has in many ways been showing the rest of the auto industry
how electric cars are done. The sleek Tesla Roadster is an
emblem of electric cars’ potential in terms of power, speed, and
range. Without it I doubt many of the larger car makers would
be pursuing electric cars as vigorously as they are. Still, I worry
about Tesla’s endurance. Building cars is a difficult, expensive
endeavor that has broken many small manufacturers who have
tried to bring innovation to the table, from John DeLorean to
Preston Tucker.
For now the outlook is promising. Not only did the IPO
take place but it included more shares at a higher price than
expected. The company boosted the number of shares to
as much as 13.3 million and the price to $17 per share, for a
total value of $226 million. The company previously had said
it could sell up to 11.1 million shares at a price of $14 to 
$16 per share, or a total of $178 million. The increase in part
reflects interest in electric cars that is greater than expected
and growing surprisingly fast. Tesla is trading on the Nasdaq
stock market under the symbol TSLA.

Table 11.1 presents data on private investment in the U. S. economy in 2009. About half of the
total was equipment and software. Almost all the rest was investment in structures, both residen-
tial (apartment buildings, condominiums, houses, and so on) and nonresidential (factories, shop-
ping malls, and so on). Inventory investment was negative (sales exceeded production in 2009).
Column 3 looks at private investment as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of
the total output of the economy.

Depreciation is the decline in an asset’s (resource’s) economic value over time. If you have
ever owned a car, you are aware that its resale value falls with age. Suppose you bought a new
Toyota Prius for $30,500 and you decide to sell it 2 years and 25,000 miles later. Checking the
newspaper and talking to several dealers, you find out that, given its condition and mileage, you
can expect to get $22,000 for it. It has depreciated $8,500 ($30,500 - $22,000). Table 11.1 shows
that in 2009, private depreciation in the U.S. economy was $1,538.8 billion.
A capital asset can depreciate because it wears out physically or because it becomes obsolete.
Take,for example,a computer control system in a factory.If a new,technologically superior system
does the same job for half the price, the old system may be replaced even if it still functions well.
The Prius depreciated because of wear and tear and because new models had become available.
The Capital Market
Where does capital come from? How and why is it produced? How much and what kinds of cap-
ital are produced? Who pays for it? These questions are answered in the complex set of institu-
tions in which households supply their savings to firms that demand funds to buy capital goods.
Collectively, these institutions are called the capital market.
Although governments and households make some capital investment decisions, most deci-
sions to produce new capital goods—that is, to invest—are made by firms. However, a firm cannot
invest unless it has the funds to do so. Although firms can invest in many ways, it is always the case
that the funds that firms use to buy capital goods come, directly or indirectly, from households.
When a household decides not to consume a portion of its income, it saves. Investment by firms is
the demand for capital. Saving by households is the supply of capital. Various financial institutions
facilitate the transfer of households’ savings to firms that use them for capital investment.
Let us use a simple example to see how the system works. Suppose some firm wants to pur-
chase a machine that costs $1,000 and some household decides at the same time to save $1,000
from its income. Figure 11.1 shows one way that the household’s decision to save might connect
with the firm’s decision to invest.
Either directly or through a financial intermediary (such as a bank), the household agrees to
loan its savings to the firm. In exchange, the firm contracts to pay the household interest at some
agreed-to rate each period. Interest is the fee paid by a borrower to a lender or by a bank to a
depositor for the use of funds. The interest rate is that fee paid annually, and it is expressed as a
percentage of the loan or deposit. If the household lends directly to the firm, the firm gives the
household a bond, which is nothing more than a contract promising to repay the loan at some
specific time in the future. The bond also specifies the flow of interest to be paid in the meantime.

The new saving adds to the household’s stock of wealth.The household’s net worth has increased
by the $1,000, which it holds in the form of a bond.1 The bond represents the firm’s promise to repay
the $1,000 at some future date with interest. The firm uses the $1,000 to buy a new $1,000 machine,
which it adds to its capital stock. In essence, the household has supplied the capital demanded by the
firm. It is almost as if the household bought the machine and rented it to the firm for an annual fee.
Presumably, this investment will generate added revenues that will facilitate the payment of interest
to the household.In general,projects are undertaken as long as the revenues likely to be realized from
the investment are sufficient to cover the interest payments to the household.
Sometimes the transfer of household savings through the capital market into investment
occurs without a financial intermediary. An entrepreneur is one who organizes, manages, and
assumes the risk of a new firm. When entrepreneurs start a new business by buying capital with
their own savings, they are both demanding capital and supplying the resources (that is, their sav-
ings) needed to purchase that capital. No third party is involved in the transaction. Most invest-
ment, however, is accomplished with the help of financial intermediaries (third parties such as
banks, insurance companies, and pension funds) that stand between the supplier (saver) and the
demander (investing firm). The part of the capital market in which savers and investors interact
through intermediaries is often called the financial capital market.
Capital Income: Interest and Profits
It should now be clear to you how capital markets fit into the circular flow: They facilitate the move-
ment of household savings into the most productive investment projects. When households allow
their savings to be used to purchase capital, they receive payments, and these payments (along with
wages and salaries) are part of household incomes. Income that is earned on savings that have been
put to use through financial capital markets is called capital income. Capital income is received by
households in many forms, the two most important of which are interest and profits.
Interest
The most common form of capital income received by households is interest. In
simplest terms, interest is the payment made for the use of money. Banks pay interest to deposi-
tors, whose deposits are loaned out to businesses or individuals who want to make investments.2
Banks also charge interest to those who borrow money. Corporations pay interest to households
1 Note that the act of saving increases the household’s wealth, not the act of buying the bond. Buying the bond simply transforms
one financial asset (money) into another (a bond). The household could simply have held on to the money.
2 Although we are focusing on investment by businesses, households can and do make investments also. The most important
form of household investment is the construction of a new house, usually financed by borrowing in the form of a mortgage. A
household may also borrow to finance the purchase of an existing house, but when it does so, no new investment is taking place.

that buy their bonds. The government borrows money by issuing bonds, and the buyers of those
bonds receive interest payments.
The interest rate is almost always expressed as an annual rate. It is the annual interest pay-
ment expressed as a percentage of the loan or deposit. For example, a $1,000 bond (representing
a $1,000 loan from a household to a firm) that carries a fixed 10 percent interest rate will pay the
household $100 per year ($1,000  .10) in interest. A savings account that carries a 5 percent
annual interest rate will pay $50 annually on a balance of $1,000.
The interest rate is usually agreed to at the time a loan or deposit is made. Sometimes bor-
rowers and lenders agree to periodically adjust the level of interest payments depending on mar-
ket conditions. These types of loans are called adjustable or floating-rate loans. (Fixed rate loans
are loans in which the interest rate never varies.) In recent years, there have even been adjustable
rates of interest on savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
A loan’s interest rate depends on a number of factors. A loan that involves more risk will gen-
erally pay a higher interest rate than a loan with less risk. Similarly, firms that are considered bad
credit risks will pay higher interest rates than firms with good credit ratings. You have probably
heard radio or TV advertisements by finance companies offering to loan money to borrowers
“regardless of credit history.” This means that they will loan to people or businesses that pose a
relatively high risk of defaulting, or not paying off the loan. What they do not tell you is that the
interest rate will be quite high.
It is generally agreed that the safest borrower is the U.S. government. With the “full faith and
credit” of the U.S. government pledged to buyers of U.S. Treasury bonds and bills, most people
believe that there is little risk that the government will not repay its loans. For this reason, the U.S.
government can borrow money at a lower interest rate than any other borrower.
Profits
Profits is another word for the net income of a firm: revenue minus costs of produc-
tion. Some firms are owned by individuals or partners who sell their products for more than it
costs to produce them.The profits of proprietors or partnerships generally go directly to the owner
or owners who run the firm. Corporations are firms owned by shareholders who usually are not
otherwise connected with the firms. Corporations are organized and chartered under state laws
that grant limited liability status to their owners or shareholders.Essentially,that means that share-
holders cannot lose more than they have invested if the company incurs liabilities it cannot pay.
A share of common stock is a certificate that represents the ownership of a share of a busi-
ness, almost always a corporation. For example, Lincoln Electric is a Cleveland-based company
that makes welding and cutting equipment. The company has 41 million shares of common stock
that are owned by tens of thousands of shareholders, some of whom are private individuals, some
of whom are institutions such as Carlton College, and some of whom may be employees of the
firm. Shareholders are entitled to a share of the company’s profit. When profits are paid directly
to shareholders, the payment is called a dividend. Lincoln Electric made a profit of $54 million in
a recent year, which was $1.31 per share, of which $0.43 was paid out to shareholders as dividends
and the rest retained for investment. 3
In discussing profit, it is important to distinguish between profit as defined by generally
accepting accounting practices and economic profits as we defined them in Chapter 7. Recall that
our definition of profit is total revenue minus total cost, where total cost includes the normal rate
of return on capital. We defined profit this way because true economic cost includes the opportu-
nity cost of capital.
Functions of Interest and Profit
Capital income serves several functions. First, inter-
est may function as an incentive to postpone gratification. When you save, you pass up the
chance to buy things that you want right now. One view of interest holds that it is the reward for
postponing consumption.
Second, profit serves as a reward for innovation and risk taking. Every year Forbes magazine
publishes the names of the richest people in the United States, and virtually every major fortune
stock
A share of stock is an
ownership claim on a firm,
entitling its owner to a 
profit share.
3 Shares of common stock are traded openly on private stock exchanges or markets. Most of the billions of shares traded every
day are one shareholder selling shares to another. When shares are first issued, the proceeds are used to buy capital or to “buy
out” the entrepreneurs who started the firm.

listed there is traceable to the founding of some business enterprise that “made it big.” In recent
years, big winners have included retail stores (the Walton family of Wal-Mart), high-tech companies
(Bill Gates of Microsoft and Eric Schmidt of Google), and a real estate empire (the Pritzker family).
Many argue that rewards for innovation and risk taking are the essence of the U.S. free enter-
prise system. Innovation is at the core of economic growth and progress. More efficient produc-
tion techniques mean that the resources saved can be used to produce new things. There is another
side to this story, however: Critics of the free enterprise system claim that such large rewards are
not justified and that accumulations of great wealth and power are not in society’s best interests.
Financial Markets in Action
When a firm issues a fixed-interest-rate bond, it borrows funds and pays interest at an agreed-to
rate to the person or institution that buys the bond. Many other mechanisms, four of which are
illustrated in Figure 11.2, also channel household savings into investment projects.
Case A: Business Loans
As I look around my hometown, I see several ice cream stores
doing very well; but I think that I can make better ice cream than they do. To go into the busi-
ness, I need capital: ice cream-making equipment, tables, chairs, freezers, signs, and a store.
Because I put up my house as collateral, I am not a big risk; so the bank grants me a loan at a
fairly reasonable interest rate. Banks have these funds to lend only because households deposit
their savings there.
Case B: Venture Capital
A scientist at a leading university develops an inexpensive
method of producing a very important family of virus-fighting drugs, using microorganisms cre-
ated through gene splicing. The business could very well fail within 12 months, but if it succeeds,
the potential for profit is huge.
Our scientist goes to a venture capital fund for financing. Such funds take household savings
and put them into high-risk ventures in exchange for a share of the profits if the new businesses
succeed. By investing in many different projects, the funds reduce the risk of going broke. Once

again, household funds make it possible for firms to undertake investments. If a venture succeeds,
those owning shares in the venture capital fund receive substantial profits.
Case C: Retained Earnings
IBM decides in 2009 to build a new plant in Dubuque, Iowa,
and it discovers that it has enough funds to pay for the new facility. The new investment is thus
paid for through internal funds, or retained earnings.
The result is the same as if the firm had gone to households via some financial intermediary
and borrowed the funds. If IBM uses its profits to buy new capital, it does so only with the share-
holders’ implicit consent. When a firm takes its own profit and uses it to buy capital assets instead
of paying it out to its shareholders, the total value of the firm goes up, as does the value of the
shares held by stockholders. As in our other examples, IBM capital stock increases and so does the
net worth of households.
When a household owns a share of stock that appreciates, or increases in value, the apprecia-
tion is part of the household’s income. Unless the household sells the stock and consumes the
gain, that gain is part of saving. In essence, when a firm retains earnings for investment purposes,
it is actually saving on behalf of its shareholders.
Case D: The Stock Market
A former high-ranking government official decides to start a
new peanut-processing business in Atlanta; he also decides to raise the funds needed by issuing
shares of stock. Households buy the shares with income that they decide not to spend. In
exchange, they are entitled to a share of the peanut firm’s profits.
The shares of stock become part of households’ net worth. The proceeds from stock sales are
used to buy plant equipment and inventory. Savings flow into investment, and the firm’s capital
stock goes up by the same amount as household net worth. The Economics in Practice on p. 235
describes how Tesla raised funds in this way.
Mortgages and the Mortgage Market
Most real estate in the United States is financed by mortgages. A mortgage, like a bond, is a
contract in which the borrower promises to repay the lender in the future. Mortgages are
backed by real estate. When a household buys a home, it usually borrows most of the money
by signing a mortgage in which it agrees to repay the money with interest often over as long
as 30 years. While in recent years all kinds of exotic payment schemes have complicated the
mortgage market, the most common form of mortgage is the 30-year fixed rate mortgage.
Almost all mortgage loans require a monthly payment. As an example, a home financed with
a 30-year fixed rate mortgage loan of $250,000 at 6.4 percent will face a monthly payment of
$1,563.76. If the borrower pays that amount each month for 30 years, he or she will have paid
off the loan while paying interest at a rate of 6.4 percent on the unpaid balance each month.
Until the last decade, most mortgage loans were made by banks and savings and loans. The
lenders used depositors’ money to make the loans, and the signed promissory notes were kept by
the lenders who collected the payment every month.
Recently, the mortgage market changed dramatically and became more complicated. Most
mortgages are now written by mortgage brokers or mortgage bankers who immediately sell
the mortgages to a secondary market. The secondary market is run by governmental agencies
such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and large investment banks. Loans in this market are
“securitized,” which means that the mortgage documents are pooled and then mortgage-
backed securities are sold to investors who want to take different degrees of risk.
The risk of owning mortgages is primarily the risk that the borrower will default on the
obligation. When default occurs, the house may be taken through foreclosure, a procedure in
which the lender takes possession of the borrower’s house and sells it to get back at least some of
the amount that the lender is owed.
In 2007, the mortgage market was hit by a dramatic increase in the number of defaults
and foreclosures. Lenders lost billions of dollars, and hundreds of thousands of homes went
into foreclosure. The reasons were that home prices began falling for the first time in many
years and that a large number of loans were made to buyers who could not make the
required payments.

CHAPTER 11
Input Demand: The Capital Market and the Investment Decision 241
In modern industrial societies, investment decisions (capital production decisions) are
made primarily by firms. Households decide how much to save, and in the long run, sav-
ings limit or constrain the amount of investment that firms can undertake. The capital
market exists to direct savings into profitable investment projects.
The Demand for New Capital and the
Investment Decision
We saw in Chapter 9 that firms have an incentive to expand in industries that earn positive
profits—that is, a rate of return above normal—and in industries in which economies of scale
lead to lower average costs at higher levels of output. We also saw that positive profits in an indus-
try stimulate the entry of new firms. The expansion of existing firms and the creation of new
firms both involve investment in new capital.
Even when there are no profits in an industry, firms must still do some investing. First,
equipment wears out and must be replaced if the firm is to stay in business. Second, firms are
constantly changing. A new technology may become available, sales patterns may shift, or the
firm may expand or contract its product line.
With these points in mind, we now turn to a discussion of the investment decision
process within the individual firm. In the end, we will see (just as we did in Chapter 10) that a
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Who Owns Stocks in the United States?
In the text we describe how households buy shares of stock as a way to
invest in businesses and to generate hoped-for returns. In some cases
households do this as individuals. There have always been individuals
who have invested in stocks in specific companies through brokerage
firms. As the number of low-cost brokerage firms has grown, many
more people have begun trading this way. In the last decade, we have
seen the growth of day traders, individuals who buy and sell shares of
stock quickly in the hopes of making money. But, in terms of value,
the bulk of the stock in the United States is held by households
through institutions, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual
funds, and the like. For some companies, a large majority of their
stock is held by households through institutions. In the two charts
below, taken from Yahoo Finance on June 23, 2010, we see the extent
of institutional holding in two companies: Microsoft and Activision,
the producer of video games like Guitar Hero and World of Warcraft.
You can see that a more mature company like Microsoft has a much
higher rate of institutional holdings than does the newer Activision.
You can also see that for both firms, insiders (people who work for the
company) hold quite a lot of the firm’s stock, and this is especially true
for the newer Activision.

Capital Accumulation and Allocation
You can see from the preceding examples that various, and sometimes complex, connections
between households and firms facilitate the movement of savings into productive invest-
ment. The methods may differ, but the results are the same. Industrialized or agrarian, small
or large, simple or complex, all societies exist through time and must allocate resources 
over time. In simple societies, investment and saving decisions are made by the same 
people. However:

242
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
perfectly competitive firm invests in capital up to the point at which the marginal revenue
product of capital is equal to the price of capital.
Forming Expectations
We have already said that the most important dimension of capital is time. Capital produces
useful services over some period of time. In building an office tower, a developer makes an
investment that will be around for decades. In deciding where to build a branch plant, a man-
ufacturing firm commits a large amount of resources to purchase capital that will be in place
for a long time.
It is important to remember, though, that capital goods do not begin to yield benefits until
they are used. Often the decision to build a building or purchase a piece of equipment must be
made years before the actual project is completed. Although the acquisition of a small business
computer may take only days, the planning process for downtown development projects in big
U.S. cities has been known to take decades.
The Expected Benefits of Investments
Decision makers must have expectations
about what is going to happen in the future. A new plant will be very valuable—that is, it will
produce much profit—if the market for a firm’s product grows and the price of that product
remains high. The same plant will be worth little if the economy goes into a slump or con-
sumers grow tired of the firm’s product. The Tesla’s success will depend not only on consumer
tastes for electric cars, but also on the government’s energy policy. The investment process
requires that the potential investor evaluate the expected flow of future productive services that
an investment project will yield.
An official of the General Electric Corporation (GE) once described the difficulty
involved in making such predictions. GE subscribes to a number of different economic fore-
casting services. In the early 1980s, those services provided the firm with 10-year predictions
of new housing construction that ranged from a low of 400,000 new units per year to a high
of 4 million new units per year. Because GE sells millions of household appliances to contrac-
tors building new houses, condominiums, and apartments, the forecast was critical. If GE
decided that the high number was more accurate, it would need to spend billions of dollars
on new plant and equipment to prepare for the extra demand. If GE decided that the low
number was more accurate, it would need to begin closing several of its larger plants and dis-
investing. In fact, GE took the middle road. It assumed that housing production would be
between 1.5 and 2 million units—which, in fact, it was.
GE is not an exception. All firms must rely on forecasts to make sensible investment and pro-
duction decisions, but forecasting is an inexact science because so much depends on events that
cannot be foreseen.
The Expected Costs of Investments
The benefits of any investment project 
take the form of future profits. These profits must be forecast, but costs must also be evalu-
ated. Like households, firms have access to financial markets, both as borrowers and 
as lenders. If a firm borrows, it must pay interest over time. If it lends, it will earn interest.
If the firm borrows to finance a project, the interest on the loan is part of the cost of
the project.
Even if a project is financed with the firm’s own fund instead of through borrowing, an
opportunity cost is involved. A thousand dollars put into a capital investment project will gener-
ate an expected flow of future profit; the same $1,000 put into the financial market (in essence,
loaned to another firm) will yield a flow of interest payments. The project will not be undertaken
unless it is expected to yield more than the market interest rate. The cost of an investment project
may thus be direct or indirect because the ability to lend at the market rate of interest means that
there is an opportunity cost associated with every investment project. The evaluation process thus
involves not only estimating future benefits but also comparing them with the possible alterna-
tive uses of the funds required to undertake the project. At a minimum, those funds could earn
interest in financial markets.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Chinese Wind Power
One of the most interesting investment phenomena in the last few
years has been the strong interest by the Chinese in wind power.As the
article below indicates, by 2009 China had become the world’s largest
wind power market. As we suggest in the text, investments—because
they are long-lived—depend critically on future expectations. In the
case of wind power investments, investors have to make judgments
about government climate and energy policy, both in China and else-
where, about tariff policy, about the future of substitute products like
oil, and about economic growth more generally. The uncertainty of
these complex factors makes wind investing in China a risky business.
Gone With The Wind: Capital for China’s
Turbine Makers
The Wall Street Journal
“A great wind is blowing, and that gives you either imagination
or a headache.” Catherine the Great surely was referring to
capital raising for China’s wind turbine makers. As Dow Jones
Investment Banker reports, for them, a headache is more likely.
Last year was a good time for China when it became
the largest wind market by annual installed capacity at 
13 gigawatts, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.
Unfortunately that growth heralds overcapacity for
Chinese turbine makers, suggesting a shake-out for some
smaller names after 2009’s aggressive build out. That should,
of course, play to survivors’ advantage in the long-term.
Favorable macro-tailwinds and preferential policy over
the last five years have helped China’s wind industry. For
example, farm operators are aided by on-grid tariffs for wind
being higher than fossil fuels’, while local component-
makers gain from rules ensuring at least 70 percent of tur-
bine components by purchase value are made domestically.

Comparing Costs and Expected Return
Once expectations have been formed, firms must quantify them—that is, they must assign some
dollars-and-cents value to them. One way to quantify expectations is to calculate an expected
rate of return on the investment project. For example, if a new computer network that costs
$400,000 is likely to save $100,000 per year in data-processing costs forever after, the expected rate
of return on that investment is 25 percent per year. Each year the firm will save $100,000 as a result
of the $400,000 investment. The expected rate of return will be less than 25 percent if the com-
puter network wears out or becomes obsolete after a while and the cost saving ceases. The expected
rate of return on an investment project depends on the price of the investment, the expected
length of time the project provides additional cost savings or revenue, and the expected amount of
revenue attributable each year to the project.
Table 11.2 presents a menu of investment choices and expected rates of return that a
hypothetical firm faces. Because expected rates of return are based on forecasts of future

profits attributable to the investments, any change in expectations would change all the
numbers in column 2.
Figure 11.3 graphs the total amount of investment in millions of dollars that the firm would
undertake at various interest rates. If the interest rate were 24 percent, the firm would fund only
project A, the new computer network. It can borrow at 24 percent and invest in a computer that
is expected to yield 25 percent. At 24 percent, the firm’s total investment is $400,000. The first
vertical red line in Figure 11.3 shows that at any interest rate above 20 percent and below 25 per-
cent, only $400,000 worth of investment (that is, project A) will be undertaken.
If the interest rate were 18 percent, the firm would fund projects A and B, and its total
investment would rise to $3 million ($400,000 + $2,600,000). If the firm could borrow at 18 per-
cent, the flow of additional profits generated by the new computer and the new plant would
more than cover the costs of borrowing, but none of the other projects would be justified. The
rates of return on projects A and B (25 percent and 20 percent, respectively) both exceed the 18
percent interest rate. Only if the interest rate fell below 5 percent would the firm fund all seven
investment projects.
The investment schedule in Table 11.2 and its graphic depiction in Figure 11.3 describe the
firm’s demand for new capital, expressed as a function of the market interest rate. If we add the
total investment undertaken by all firms at every interest rate, we arrive at the demand for new
capital in the economy as a whole. In other words, the market demand curve for new capital is the
sum of all the individual demand curves for new capital in the economy (Figure 11.4). In a sense,
the investment demand schedule is a ranking of all the investment opportunities in the economy
in order of expected yield. Only those investment projects in the economy that are expected to
yield a rate of return higher than the market interest rate will be funded. At lower market interest
rates, more investment projects are undertaken.
The most important thing to remember about the investment demand curve is that its shape
and position depend critically on the expectations of those making the investment decisions.
Because many influences affect these expectations, they are usually volatile and subject to fre-
quent change. Thus, although lower interest rates tend to stimulate investment and higher inter-
est rates tend to slow it, many other hard-to-measure and hard-to-predict factors also affect the
level of investment spending.
The Expected Rate of Return and the Marginal Revenue Product of
Capital
The concept of the expected rate of return on investment projects is analogous to
the concept of the marginal revenue product of capital (MRPK). Recall that we defined an
input’s marginal revenue product as the additional revenue a firm earns by employing one
additional unit of that input, ceteris paribus.

Interest Rate
The demand for new capital
depends on the interest rate.
When the interest rate is low,
firms are more likely to invest in
new plant and equipment than
when the interest rate is high.
This is so because the interest
rate determines the direct cost
(interest on a loan) or the
opportunity cost (alternative
investment) of each project.

CHAPTER 11
Input Demand: The Capital Market and the Investment Decision 245
Now think carefully about the return on an additional unit of new capital (the marginal rev-
enue product of capital). Suppose that the rate of return on an investment in a new machine is
15 percent. This means that the investment project yields the same return as a bond yielding
15 percent. If the current interest rate is less than 15 percent, the investment project will be
undertaken because a perfectly competitive profit-maximizing firm will keep investing in new
capital up to the point at which the expected rate of return is equal to the interest rate. This is
analogous to saying that the firm will continue investing up to the point at which the marginal
revenue product of capital is equal to the price of capital, or MRPK = PK, which is what we
learned in Chapter 10.
A Final Word on Capital
The concept of capital is one of the central ideas in economics. Capital is produced by the eco-
nomic system itself. Capital generates services over time, and it is used as an input in the produc-
tion of goods and services.
The enormous productivity of modern industrial societies is due in part to the tremen-
dous amount of capital that they have accumulated over the years. It may surprise you to
know that the average worker in the United States works with about $170,000 worth of capi-
tal. Recall that in the United States, total investment (new capital) was 11.4 percent of GDP in
2009 (Table 11.1). High rates of investment have had enormous impacts in countries such as
China and Malaysia. According to recent World Bank figures, capital goods represent 40 per-
cent of China’s total output of goods and services, and in Malaysia the figure is 32 percent. In
2009, China had a growth rate of output of over 9 percent and Malaysia had over 7 percent.
Most of this chapter described the institutions and processes that determine the amount and
types of capital produced in a market economy. Existing firms in search of increased profits,
potential new entrants to the markets, and entrepreneurs with new ideas are continuously evalu-
ating potential investment projects. At the same time, households are saving. Each year house-
holds save some portion of their after-tax incomes. These new savings become part of their net
worth, and they want to earn a return on those savings. Each year a good portion of the savings
finds its way into the hands of firms that use it to buy new capital goods.
Between households and firms is the financial capital market. Millions of people participate
in financial markets every day. There are literally thousands of financial managers, pension funds,
mutual funds, brokerage houses, options traders, and banks whose sole purpose is to earn the
highest possible rate of return on people’s savings.
Brokers, bankers, and financial managers are continuously scanning the financial horizons for
profitable investments. What businesses are doing well? What businesses are doing poorly? Should
we lend to an expanding firm? All the analysis done by financial managers seeking to earn a high
yield for clients, by managers of firms seeking to earn high profits for their stockholders, and by
entrepreneurs seeking profits from innovation serves to channel capital into its most productive
uses. Within firms, the evaluation of individual investment projects involves forecasting costs and
benefits and valuing streams of potential income that will be earned only in future years.

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms 
We have now completed our discussion of competitive input and output markets. We have
looked at household and firm choices in output markets, labor markets, land markets, and capi-
tal markets.
We now turn to a discussion of the allocative process that we have described. How do all the
parts of the economy fit together? Is the result good or bad? Can we improve on it? All of this is
the subject of Chapter 12.
CAPITAL, INVESTMENT, AND DEPRECIATION p. 233
1. In market capitalist systems, the decision to put capital to
use in a particular enterprise is made by private citizens
putting their savings at risk in search of private gain. The set
of institutions through which such transactions occur is
called the capital market.
2. Capital goods are those goods produced by the economic
system that are used as inputs to produce other goods and
services in the future. Capital goods thus yield valuable pro-
ductive services over time.
3. The major categories of physical, or tangible, capital are
nonresidential structures, durable equipment, residential
structures, and inventories. Social capital (or infrastructure)
is capital that provides services to the public. Intangible
(nonmaterial) capital includes human capital and goodwill.
4. The most important dimension of capital is that it exists
through time. Therefore, its value is only as great as the value
of the services it will render over time.
5. The most common measure of a firm’s capital stock is the
current market value of its plant, equipment, inventories,
and intangible assets. However, in thinking about capital, it
is important to focus on the actual capital stock instead of its
simple monetary value.
6. In economics, the term investment refers to the creation of
new capital, not to the purchase of a share of stock or a
bond. Investment is a flow that increases the capital stock.
7. Depreciation is the decline in an asset’s economic value over
time. A capital asset can depreciate because it wears out
physically or because it becomes obsolete.
THE CAPITAL MARKET p. 236
8. Income that is earned on savings that have been put to use
through financial capital markets is called capital income. The
two most important forms of capital income are interest and
profits. Interest is the fee paid by a borrower to a lender.
Interest rewards households for postponing gratification, and
profit rewards entrepreneurs for innovation and risk taking.
9. In modern industrial societies, investment decisions (capital
production decisions) are made primarily by firms.
Households decide how much to save, and in the long run,
saving limits the amount of investment that firms can
undertake. The capital market exists to direct savings into
profitable investment projects.
THE DEMAND FOR NEW CAPITAL AND THE
INVESTMENT DECISION p. 241
10. Before investing, investors must evaluate the expected flow of
future productive services that an investment project will yield.
11. The availability of interest to lenders means that there is an
opportunity cost associated with every investment project.
This cost must be weighed against the stream of earnings
that a project is expected to yield.
12. A firm will decide whether to undertake an investment project
by comparing costs with expected returns. The expected rate
of return on an investment project depends on the price of
the investment, the expected length of time the project pro-
vides additional cost savings or revenue, and the expected
amount of revenue attributable each year to the project.
13. The investment demand curve shows the demand for capi-
tal in the economy as a function of the market interest
rate. Only those investment projects that are expected to
yield a rate of return higher than the market interest rate
will be funded. Lower interest rates should stimulate
investment.
14. A perfectly competitive profit-maximizing firm will keep
investing in new capital up to the point at which the
expected rate of return is equal to the interest rate. This is
equivalent to saying that the firm will continue investing up
to the point at which the marginal revenue product of capi-
tal is equal to the price of capital, or MRPK = PK.

Recall that the interest rate is the amount of money that a
borrower agrees to pay a lender or a bank agrees to pay a depos-
itor each year, expressed as a percentage of the deposit or the
loan. For example, if I deposited $1,000 in an account paying
10 percent interest, I would receive $100 per year for the term of
the deposit. Sometimes we use the term rate of return to refer to
the amount of money that the lender receives from its invest-
ment each year, expressed as a percentage of the investment.
The idea is that in deciding to do any project, you must
consider the opportunity costs: What are you giving up? If you
did not do this project but put the money to use elsewhere,
would you do better?
Almost all investments that you might consider involve risks:
The project might not work out the way you anticipate, the
economy may change, or market interest rates could go up or
down. To assess the opportunity costs and to decide whether
this project is worth it, you first have to think about those risks
and decide on the rate of return that you require to compen-
sate yourself for taking the risks involved.
If there were no risk, the opportunity cost of investing
in a project would be the government-guaranteed or bank-
guaranteed interest rate. But in considering a project that
involves risk, you would want more profit in return for bearing
that risk. For example, you might invest in a sure deal if you
received a 3 percent annual return comparable to what you
might earn with a bank account or certificate of deposit,
whereas you might demand 15 percent or even 20 percent on a
very risky investment.
Evaluating the opportunity costs of any investment project
requires taking the following steps:
Step 1: The first step in evaluating the opportunity costs of an
investment project is to look at the market. What are
interest rates today? What rates of interest are people
earning by putting their money in bank accounts? If
there is risk that something could go wrong, what
interest rate is the market paying to those who accept
that risk? The discount rate used to evaluate an invest-
ment project is the interest rate that you could earn by
investing a similar amount of money in an alternative
investment of comparable risk.
Let’s suppose that the investment project
described in Table 11A.1 involved some risk. While
you are quite certain that the expected flow of profits
CHAPTER 11 APPENDIX
Calculating Present Value
We have seen in this chapter that a firm’s major goal in mak-
ing investment decisions is to evaluate revenue streams that
will not materialize until the future. One way for the firm to
decide whether to undertake an investment project is to
compare the expected rate of return from the investment
with the current interest rate available (assuming compara-
ble risk) in the financial market. We discussed this procedure
in the text. The purpose of this Appendix is to present a
more complete method of evaluating future revenue streams
through present-value analysis.
Present Value
Consider the investment project described in Table 11A.1. We
use the word project in this example to refer to buying a
machine or a piece of capital for $1,200 and receiving the cash
flow given in the right-hand column of the table. Would you
do the project? At first glance, you might answer yes. After all,
the total flow of cash that you will receive is $1,600, which is
$400 greater than the amount that you have to pay. But be care-
ful: The $1,600 comes to you over a 5-year period, and your
$1,200 must be paid right now. You must consider the alterna-
tive uses and opportunity costs of the $1,200. At the same time,
you must consider the risks that you are taking.
What are these alternatives? At a bare minimum, the same
$1,200 could be put in a bank account, where it would earn
interest. In addition, there are other things that you could do
with the same money. You could buy Treasury bonds from the
federal government that guarantee you interest of 4 percent for
5 years. Or you might find other projects with a similar degree
of risk that produce more than $1,600.
next several years. The current market interest rate on enter-
prises with comparable risks is 9% per year. Should the four
sorority sisters purchase the café?  Explain.
17. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 241] The text
states that in terms of value, the majority of stock in the United
States is held by households through institutions and the per-
centage of institutional holding of stock (as well as the percent-
age of insider holding) often varies based on the maturity of the
company. Choose two publicly traded companies based in your
local area; one relatively new and the other relatively mature. Go
to www.finance.yahoo.com and enter each company in the
“GET QUOTES” dialog box, then click on “Key Statistics” to
find trading information. Look at the Share Statistics for each
company. Describe the variation in the percentage of shares held
by institutions and the percentage of shares held by insiders for
the two companies.

CHAPTER 11
Input Demand: The Capital Market and the Investment Decision 249
in years 1–5 ($100, $100, $400, and so on) is a very
good estimate, the future is always uncertain. Let’s
further suppose that alternative investments of com-
parable risks are paying a 10 percent rate of interest
(rate of return). So you will not do this project unless
it earns at least 10 percent per year. We will thus use a
10 percent discount rate in evaluating the project.
Step 2: Now comes the trick. Is your investment worth it? By
doing the project, you must consider the opportunity
cost of the money. To do this, imagine a bank that will
pay 10 percent on deposits. The question that you
must answer is, how much would you have to put in a
bank paying 10 percent interest on deposits in order
to get the same flow of profits that you would get if
you did the project?
If it turns out that you can replicate the flow of
profits for less money up front than the project
costs—$1,200—you will not do the project. The project
would be paying you less than a 10 percent rate of
return. On the other hand, if it turns out that you
would have to put more than $1,200 in the bank to
replicate the flow of profits from the project, the project
would be earning more than 10 percent, and you
would do it.
The amount of money that you would have to
put in the imaginary bank to replicate the flow of
profits from an investment project is called the
present discounted value (PDV) or simply the
present value (PV) of the expected flow of profits
from the project. To determine that flow, we have to
look at the flow 1 year at a time.
At the end of a year, you will receive $100 if you
do the project. To receive $100 a year from now from
your hypothetical bank, how much would you have to
deposit now? The answer is clearly less than $100
because you will earn interest. Let’s call the interest
rate r. In the example, r = .10 (10 percent). To get
back $100 next year, you need to deposit X, where X
plus a year’s interest on X is equal to $100. That is,
X + rX = $100 or X(1 + r) = $100
And if we solve for X, we get
and that means if r = .10,
or
X = $90.91
To convince yourself that this is right, think of putting
$90.91 into your hypothetical bank and coming back
in a year. You get back your $90.91 plus interest of
10 percent, which is $9.09.When you add the interest to
X = $100
1.1
X =
$100
(1 + r)
the initial deposit, you get $90.91 + 9.09, or exactly
$100. We say that the present value of $100 a year from
now at a discount rate of 10 percent (r = .10) is $90.91.
Notice that if you paid more than $90.91 for the
$100 that you will receive from the project after a
year, you would be receiving less than a 10 percent
return. For example, suppose that you paid $95. If you
put $95 in an account and came back after a year and
found exactly $100, you would have received $5 in
interest. Since $5 is just about .0526 (or 5.26 percent)
of $95, the interest rate that the bank paid you is only
5.26 percent, not 10 percent.
What about the next year and the years after
that? At the end of year 2, you get another $100.
How much would you have to put in the bank today
to be able to come back in 2 years and take away
$100? Assume that you put amount X in the bank
today. Then at the end of year 1, you have X + rX,
which you keep in the account. At the end of year 2,
you have X + rX plus interest on X + rX; so at the
end of year 2 you have
(X + rX) + r(X + rX)
which can be written
X(1 + r) + rX(1 + r) or X(1 + r)(1 + r) or X(1 + r)2
Therefore,
is the amount you must deposit today to get back
$100 in 2 years.
If r = .10, then
To convince yourself that this calculation is right,
if you put $82.65 in your hypothetical bank today and
came back to check the balance after a year, you
would have $82.65 plus interest of 10 percent, or
$8.26, which is $90.91. But this time you leave it in the
bank and receive 10 percent on the entire balance
during the second year, which is $9.09. Adding the
additional 10 percent, you get back to $100. Thus, if
you deposit $82.65 in an account and come back in
2 years, you will have $100. The present value of
$100 2 years from now is $82.65.
Now on to year 3. This time you receive a check
for $400, but you don’t get it until 3 years have
passed. Again, how much would you have to put in
your hypothetical bank to end up with $400?
Without doing all the math, you can show that X,
the amount that you must deposit to get back $400
in 3 years, is
X =
$400
(1 + r)3
X = $100
(1.1)2 or X = $82.65
X =

and if r = .10,
In general, the present value (PV), or present dis-
counted value, of R dollars to be received in t years is
Step 3: Once you have looked at the project 1 year at a
time, you must add up the total present value to see
what the whole project is worth. In Table 11A.2, the
right-hand column shows the present value of each
year’s return. If you add up the total, you have
arrived at the amount that you would have to put in
your hypothetical bank (that pays interest on
deposits at 10 percent) today to receive the exact
flow that is expected to come from the project. That
total is $1,126.06.
So if you go to the bank today and put in
$1,126.06, then come back in a year and withdraw
$100, then come back after 2 years and withdraw
another $100, then come back in 3 years and with-
draw $400, and so on, until 5 years have passed, when
you show up to close the account at the end of the
fifth year, there will be exactly $500 left to withdraw.
Lo and behold, you have figured out that you can
receive the exact flow of profit that the project is
expected to yield for $1,126.06. If you were looking
for a 10 percent yield, you would not spend $1,200 for
it. You would not do the project.

What you have done is to convert an expected
flow of dollars from an investment project that comes
to you over some extended period of time to a single
number: the present value of the flow.
We can restate the point this way: If the present value of
the income stream associated with an investment is less than
the full cost of the investment project, the investment should
not be undertaken. This is illustrated in Figure 11A.1.
It is important to remember that we are discussing 
the demand for new capital. Business firms must evaluate
potential investments to decide whether they are worth

undertaking. This involves predicting the flow of potential
future profits arising from each project and comparing
those future profits with the return available in the financial
market at the current interest rate. The present-value
method allows firms to calculate how much it would cost
today to purchase a contract for the same flow of earnings in
the financial market.
Lower Interest Rates, Higher Present Values
Now consider what would happen if you used a lower inter-
est rate in calculating the present value of a flow of earn-
ings. You might use a lower rate in the analysis because
interest rates in general have gone down in financial mar-
kets, making the opportunity cost of investment lower in
general. You might also find out that the project is less risky
than you believed earlier. For whatever reason, let’s say that
you would now do the project if it produced a return of
5 percent.
In evaluating the present value, the firm now looks at
each year’s flow of profit and asks how much it would cost to
earn that amount if it were able to earn exactly 5 percent on
its money in a hypothetical bank. With a lower interest rate,
the firm will have to pay more now to purchase the same
number of future dollars. Consider, for example, the present
value of $100 in 2 years. We saw that if the firm puts aside
$82.65 at 10 percent interest, it will have $100 in 2 years—at a

Input Demand: The Capital Market and the Investment Decision 251
10 percent interest rate, the present discounted value (or
current market price) of $100 in 2 years is $82.65. However,
$82.65 put aside at a 5 percent interest rate would generate
only $4.13 in interest in the first year and $4.34 in the second
year, for a total balance of $91.11 after 2 years. To get $100 in
2 years, the firm needs to put aside more than $82.65 now.
Solving for X as we did before,
When the interest rate falls from 10 percent to 5 percent,
the present value of $100 in 2 years rises by $8.05 ($90.70
- $82.65).
Table 11A.3 recalculates the present value of the full
stream at the lower interest rate; it shows that a decrease in the
interest rate from 10 percent to 5 percent causes the total present
value to rise to $1,334.59. Because the investment project costs
less than this (only $1,200), it should be undertaken. It is now a
better deal than can be obtained in the financial market. Under
these conditions, a profit-maximizing firm will make the
investment. As discussed in the chapter, a lower interest rate
leads to more investment.

The basic rule is as follows:
If the present value of an expected stream of earnings
from an investment exceeds the cost of the investment
necessary to undertake it, the investment should be
undertaken. However, if the present value of an expected
stream of earnings falls short of the cost of the invest-
ment, the financial market can generate the same stream
of income for a smaller initial investment and the invest-
ment should not be undertaken.

future is the amount you need to pay today, at current
interest rates, to ensure that you end up with R dollars

R dollars in t years.
2. If the present value of the income stream associated with an
investment is less than the full cost of the investment project,
the investment project should not be undertaken. If the present
value of an expected stream of income exceeds the cost of
the investment necessary to undertake it, the investment
should be undertaken.

Mechanism p. 264 
In the last nine chapters, we have built a model of a simple, perfectly competitive economy. Our dis-
cussion has revolved around the two fundamental decision-making units, households and firms,
which interact in two basic market arenas, input markets and output markets. (Look again at the cir-
cular flow diagram, shown in Figure II.1 on p. 117.) By limiting our discussion to perfectly competi-
tive firms, we have been able to examine how the basic decision-making units interact in the two
basic market arenas.
Households make constrained choices in both input and output markets.Household income,for
example, depends on choices made in input markets: whether to work, how much to work, what
skills to acquire, and so on. Input market choices are constrained by such factors as current wage
rates, availability of jobs, and interest rates.
Firms are the primary producing units in a market economy. Profit-maximizing firms, to
which we have limited our discussion, earn their profits by selling products and services for more
than it costs to produce them. With firms, as with households, output markets and input markets
cannot be analyzed separately. All firms make three specific decisions simultaneously: (1) how
much output to supply, (2) how to produce that output—that is, which technology to use, and
(3) how much of each input to demand.
In Chapters 7 through 9, we explored these three decisions from the viewpoint of output
markets. We saw that the portion of the marginal cost curve that lies above a firm’s average
variable cost curve is the supply curve of a perfectly competitive firm in the short run. Implicit
in the marginal cost curve is a choice of technology and a set of input demands. In Chapters 10
and 11, we looked at the perfectly competitive firm’s three basic decisions from the viewpoint
of input markets.
Output and input markets are connected because firms and households make simultaneous
choices in both arenas, but there are other connections among markets as well. Firms buy in both
capital and labor markets, for example, and they can substitute capital for labor and vice versa. A
change in the price of one factor can easily change the demand for other factors. Buying more
capital, for instance, usually changes the marginal revenue product of labor and shifts the labor
demand curve. Similarly, a change in the price of a single good or service usually affects house-
hold demand for other goods and services, as when a price decrease makes one good more attrac-
tive than other close substitutes. The same change also makes households better off when they

PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms
find that the same amount of income will buy more. Such additional “real income” can be spent
on any of the other goods and services that the household buys.
The point here is simple:
Input and output markets cannot be considered as if they were separate entities or as if they
operated independently. Although it is important to understand the decisions of individual
firms and households and the functioning of individual markets, we now need to add it all
up so we can look at the operation of the system as a whole.
You have seen the concept of equilibrium applied both to markets and to individual
decision-making units. In individual markets, supply and demand determine an equilibrium
price. Perfectly competitive firms are in short-run equilibrium when price and marginal cost are
equal (P = MC). In the long run, however, equilibrium in a competitive market is achieved only
when economic profits are eliminated. Households are in equilibrium when they have equated
the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good to the marginal utility per dollar spent on all
other goods. This process of examining the equilibrium conditions in individual markets and for
individual households and firms separately is called partial equilibrium analysis.
A general equilibrium exists when all markets in an economy are in simultaneous equilib-
rium. An event that disturbs the equilibrium in one market may disturb the equilibrium in
many other markets as well. The ultimate impact of the event depends on the way all markets
adjust to it. Thus, partial equilibrium analysis, which looks at adjustments in one isolated mar-
ket, may be misleading.
Thinking in terms of a general equilibrium leads to some important questions. Is it possible for
all households and firms and all markets to be in equilibrium simultaneously? Are the equilibrium
conditions that we have discussed separately compatible with one another? Why is an event that dis-
turbs an equilibrium in one market likely to disturb many other equilibriums simultaneously?
In talking about general equilibrium in the beginning of this chapter, we continue our exer-
cise in positive economics—that is, we seek to understand how systems operate without making
value judgments about outcomes. Later in the chapter, we turn from positive economics to
normative economics as we begin to judge the economic system. Are its results good or bad? Can
we make them better?
In judging the performance of any economic system, you will recall, it is essential first to
establish specific criteria by which to judge. In this chapter, we use two such criteria: efficiency
and equity (fairness). First, we demonstrate the efficiency of the allocation of resources—that is,
the system produces what people want and does so at the least possible cost—if all the assump-
tions that we have made thus far hold. When we begin to relax some of our assumptions, how-
ever, it will become apparent that free markets may not be efficient. Several sources of
inefficiency naturally occur within an unregulated market system. In the final part of this chap-
ter, we introduce the potential role of government in correcting market inefficiencies and
achieving fairness.
Market Adjustment to Changes in Demand
All economies, particularly market systems, are dynamic: Change occurs all the time. Markets
experience shifts of demand, both up and down; costs and technology change; and prices and out-
puts change. We have spent a lot of time looking at how these changes affect individual markets.
But markets are also connected to one another. If capital flows into one market, often that means it
is flowing out of another market. If consumers ride trains, often that means they stay off the bus.
How do we think about connections across markets?
As we look at the general case, you might find it helpful to keep an example in mind. In 2007,
Amazon introduced the Kindle, a small machine that allows a person to read e-books. We could
analyze this product introduction in a partial equilibrium setting, considering the responsiveness
of potential buyers to price or quality changes in the Kindle. But the introduction of the Kindle and
subsequent pricing decisions by Amazon affect other markets as well. E-books substitute in part
for printed books. The introduction of the Kindle and subsequent price reductions in the device
thus shift the demand for printed books to the left. When the demand for printed books falls,
storefront booksellers like Barnes and Noble suffer profit losses. Likely their sales of other products

in the stores—complements to their book sales—also decline. Many printed books are ordered over
the Web, many in fact through Amazon itself. When demand for these books falls, shipping services
like UPS lose business. Printed books are produced using paper.When the demand for books falls, so
does the demand for paper, and through that channel the demand for forest products falls.
Nor is the story over there. When Amazon prices the Kindle, it must take into account what is
going on in the marketplace for printed books. If Barnes and Noble responds to the shift in its
demand by lowering prices of printed books, that move will influence the optimal price for the
Kindle. If the fall in demand for paper reduces the cost of paper, the costs of printing books will fall,
and that too will lead to a lower price for printed books.Amazon will need to respond to that as well.
In a general equilibrium analysis one needs to work through all the feedback loops and connections
across industries to get to a final answer.
Figure 12.1 begins our discussion of the more general case of market connections. In the fig-
ure we assume that there are two sectors in the economy, X and Y, and that both are currently in
long-run equilibrium. Total output in sector X is

price is just equal to average cost and economic profits are zero. The same condition holds initially
in sector Y. The market is in zero profit equilibrium at a price of

lation or in something else) shifts the demand for X out to the right from

With the downward shift of demand in Y, price falls to
Firms in sector Y cut back to
(the

), and the lower price causes firms producing Y to suffer losses.
In the short run, adjustment is simple. Firms in both industries are constrained by their cur-
rent scales of plant. Firms can neither enter nor exit their respective industries. Each firm in
industry X raises output somewhat, from 
to 
Firms in industry Y cut back from 
to 
In response to the existence of profit in sector X, the capital market begins to take notice. In
Chapter 9, we saw that new firms are likely to enter an industry in which there are profits to be
earned. Financial analysts see the profits as a signal of future healthy growth, and entrepreneurs
may become interested in moving into the industry.
Adding all of this together, we would expect to see investment begin to favor sector X. This is
indeed the case: Capital begins to flow into sector X. As new firms enter, the short-run supply
curve in the industry shifts to the right and continues to do so until all profits are eliminated. In
the top-left diagram in Figure 12.1, the supply curve shifts out from 
to 
a shift that drives
the price back down to 
We would also expect to see a movement out of sector Y because of losses. Some firms will
exit the industry. In the bottom-left diagram in Figure 12.1, the supply curve shifts back from 
to 
a shift that drives the price back up to 
At this point, all losses are eliminated.
Note that a new general equilibrium is not reached until equilibrium is reestablished in all
markets. If costs of production remain unchanged, as they do in Figure 12.1, this equilibrium
occurs at the initial product prices, but with more resources and production in X and fewer in Y.
In contrast, if an expansion in X drives up the prices of resources used specifically in X, the cost
curves in X will shift upward and the final postexpansion zero-profit equilibrium will occur at a
higher price. Such an industry is called an increasing-cost industry.
Allocative Efficiency and Competitive
Equilibrium
As we have gone through and built models of a competitive economic system, we have often
referred to the efficiency of that system. How do we think about efficiency in a general equilib-
rium world, in which many markets are interconnected?
Pareto Efficiency
In Chapter 1, we introduced several specific criteria used by economists to judge the perfor-
mance of economic systems and to evaluate alternative economic policies. These criteria are
(1) efficiency, (2) equity, (3) growth, and (4) stability. In Chapter 1, you also learned that an
efficient economy is one that produces the things that people want at the least cost. The idea
behind the efficiency criterion is that the economic system exists to serve the wants and needs
of people. If resources somehow can be reallocated to make people “better off,” then they
should be. We want to use the resources at our disposal to produce maximum well-being. The
trick is defining maximum well-being.
For many years, social philosophers wrestled with the problem of “aggregation,” or
“adding up.” When we say “maximum well-being,” we mean maximum for society. Societies are
made up of many people, and the problem has always been how to maximize satisfaction, or
well-being, for all members of society. What has emerged is the now widely accepted concept of
allocative efficiency, first developed by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in the nineteenth
century. Pareto’s very precise definition of efficiency is often referred to as Pareto efficiency or
Pareto optimality.

General Equilibrium and the Efficiency of Perfect Competition 257
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Ethanol and Land Prices
As we see in the article, a number of markets are affected by the
ethanol subsidies. The increase in the demand for ethanol drives
up the demand for corn, which in turn increases the demand for
land. Since the supply of land is finite, the price of land used to
produce corn rises. But what about the rest of the agricultural
economy? Increasing land prices increases the cost of other grains,
such as wheat. As you learned in Chapter 2, land is a key factor of
production. The increase in wheat costs shifts the supply curve to
the left, as in the figure below. Wheat prices thus also rise.
Nebraska ethanol boom causing land prices
to soar
TheIndependent.com
Ethanol is not only pumping up the price of corn in Nebraska,
but also farm real estate market values and cash rent rates
values have seen a 14-percent increase, according to the pre-
liminary results of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s annual
Farm Real Estate Market Development Survey.
According to the survey, Nebraska farmland’s average
value for the year ending Feb. 1 was $1,155 per acre, com-
pared to $1,013 per acre at this time last year, said Bruce
Johnson, the UNL agricultural economist who conducts this
annual survey.
He said preliminary findings show this was the largest all-
land value increase in the past 19 years. It is also the fourth
straight year of what Johnson called “solid advances” in land
values. He said the state’s current all-land average value is
more than 50 percent higher than the 2003 level.
Higher prices for corn because of ethanol demand are
driving the sharp rise in land prices. By early 2008, Nebraska
should have about 25 ethanol plants online, producing 1.2 bil-
lion gallons of ethanol and using more than 425 million
bushels of corn.
“The demand from rapidly growing ethanol production
has triggered the commodity market advances, and, in turn,
worked into the agricultural land market dynamic, particu-
larly in the major corn-producing areas of the state,”
Johnson said.

The U.S. government provides large subsidies for ethanol, a fuel produced from corn. Proponents of the ethanol subsidies suggest that it is one
piece of a policy that can help the United States reduce its dependence on foreign oil. In part, as a result of these subsidies, the midwestern
United States has seen a large increase in corn production relative to other grains. The following article traces another of the general equilibrium
consequences of the ethanol subsidies: an increase in the price of agricultural land.
Specifically, a change is said to be efficient when it makes some members of society better off
without making other members of society worse off. An efficient, or Pareto optimal, system is one
in which no such changes are possible. An example of a change that makes some people better off
and nobody worse off is a simple voluntary exchange. I have apples and you have nuts. I like nuts
and you like apples. We trade. We both gain, and no one loses.
For such a definition to have any real meaning, we must answer two questions: (1) What do
we mean by “better off”? and (2) How do we account for changes that make some people better
off and others worse off?
The answer to the first question is simple. People decide what “better off” and “worse off”
mean. I am the only one who knows whether I am better off after a change. If you and I exchange

258
PART II

one item for another because I like what you have and you like what I have, we both “reveal” that
we are better off after the exchange because we agreed to it voluntarily. If everyone in the neigh-
borhood wants a park and the residents all contribute to a fund to build one, they have con-
sciously changed the allocation of resources and they all are better off for it.
The answer to the second question is more complex. Nearly every change that one can imag-
ine leaves some people better off and some people worse off. If some gain and some lose as the
result of a change, and it can be demonstrated that the value of the gains exceeds the value of the
losses, then the change is said to be potentially efficient. In practice, however, the distinction
between a potentially and an actually efficient change is often ignored and all such changes are
simply called efficient.
Example: Budget Cuts in Massachusetts
Several years ago, in an effort to reduce state
spending, the budget of the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles was cut substantially. Among
other things, the state sharply reduced the number of clerks in each office. Almost immediately
Massachusetts residents found themselves waiting in line for hours when they had to register their
automobiles or get their driver’s licenses.
Drivers and car owners began paying a price: standing in line, which used time and energy
that could otherwise have been used more productively. However, before we can make sensible
efficiency judgments, we must be able to measure, or at least approximate, the value of both the
gains and the losses produced by the budget cut. To approximate the losses to car owners and dri-
vers, we might ask how much people would be willing to pay to avoid standing in those long lines.
One office estimated that 500 people stood in line every day for about 1 hour each. If each
person were willing to pay just $2 to avoid standing in line, the damage incurred would be
$1,000 (500  $2) per day. If the registry were open 250 days per year, the reduction in labor
force at that office alone would create a cost to car owners, conservatively estimated, of
$250,000 (250  $1,000) per year.
Estimates also showed that taxpayers in Massachusetts saved about $80,000 per year by hav-
ing fewer clerks at that office. If the clerks were reinstated, there would be some gains and some
losses. Car owners and drivers would gain, and taxpayers would lose. However, because we can
show that the value of the gains would substantially exceed the value of the losses, it can be
argued that reinstating the clerks would be an efficient change. Note that the only net losers
would be those taxpayers who do not own a car and do not hold driver’s licenses.1
Revisiting Consumer and Producer Surplus
In Chapter 4 we introduced the concept of consumer and producer surplus. Consumer surplus
was defined as the difference between the maximum amount that buyers are willing to pay for a
good and its current market price. You can think of a demand curve as defining a boundary that
shows maximum willingness to pay per unit at every quantity.
When you visit your favorite sandwich store, it will make you a sandwich and charge you a
fixed price. Say that the sandwich is priced at $7. If you really crave sandwiches made at that
place, you may be gaining consumer surplus. Indeed, if you were willing to pay $12 for a sand-
wich and it is selling for a price of $7, you earn a consumer surplus of $5 when you buy it.
Producer surplus is defined as the difference between the current market price of a good and
the full cost of producing it. It is, in a way, a measure of profitability.
If you go back to pages 89–91 and review the argument, you will see that demand and supply
curves, if left to their own natural adjustments, will lead the markets to an efficient equilibrium.
Specifically, they will allocate demand across sectors in a way that maximizes the total surplus
(consumer + producer) being generated by the exchange. Any change in quantity imposed on the
market will shift the curves (or one of the curves) to the left or the right, and the result will be
“deadweight losses.”
1 You might wonder whether there are other gainers and losers. What about the clerks? In analysis like this, it is usually assumed
that the citizens who pay lower taxes spend their added income on other things. The producers of those other things need to
expand to meet the new demand, and they hire more labor. Thus, a contraction of 100 jobs in the public sector will open up
100 jobs in the private sector. If the economy is fully employed, the transfer of labor to the private sector is assumed to create no
net gains or losses to the workers.

CHAPTER 12
General Equilibrium and the Efficiency of Perfect Competition 259
To really understand the argument that a perfectly competitive economy is economically effi-
cient and will lead to a Pareto efficient set of outcomes requires that we spend more time talking
about some of the basic ideas.
The Efficiency of Perfect Competition
All societies answer these basic questions in the design of their economic systems:
1. What gets produced? What determines the final mix of output?
2. How is it produced? How do capital, labor, and land get divided up among firms? In other
words, what is the allocation of resources among producers?
3. Who gets what is produced? What determines which households get how much? What is the
distribution of output among consuming households? 
The following discussion of efficiency uses these three questions and their answers to prove
informally that perfect competition is efficient. To demonstrate that the perfectly competitive
system leads to an efficient, or Pareto optimal, allocation of resources, we need to show that no
changes are possible that will make some people better off without making others worse off.
Specifically, we will show that under perfect competition, (1) resources are allocated among firms
efficiently, (2) final products are distributed among households efficiently, and (3) the system
produces the things that people want.
Efficient Allocation of Resources Among Firms
The simple definition of
efficiency holds that firms must produce their products using the best available—that is,
lowest-cost—technology. If more output could be produced with the same amount of inputs,
it would be possible to make some people better off without making others worse off.
The perfectly competitive model we have been using rests on several assumptions that assure
us that resources in such a system would indeed be efficiently allocated among firms. Most
important of these is the assumption that individual firms maximize profits. To maximize profit,
a firm must minimize the cost of producing its chosen level of output. With a full knowledge of
existing technologies, firms will choose the technology that produces the output they want at the
least cost.
There is more to this story than meets the eye, however. Inputs must be allocated across firms
in the best possible way. If we find that it is possible, for example, to take capital from firm A and
swap it for labor from firm B and produce more product in both firms, then the original allocation
was inefficient. Recall our example from Chapter 2. Farmers in Ohio and Kansas both produce
wheat and corn. The climate and soil in most of Kansas are best suited to wheat production, and
the climate and soil in Ohio are best suited to corn production. Kansas should produce most of the
wheat, and Ohio should produce most of the corn.A law that forces Kansas land into corn produc-
tion and Ohio land into wheat production would result in less of both—an inefficient allocation of
resources. However, if markets are free and open, Kansas farmers will naturally find a higher return
by planting wheat and Ohio farmers will find a higher return in corn. The free market, then,
should lead to an efficient allocation of resources among firms. As you think back on Chapter 2,
you should now see that societies operating on the production possibility frontier are efficiently
using their inputs.
The same argument can be made more general. Misallocation of resources among firms is
unlikely as long as every single firm faces the same set of prices and trade-offs in input markets.
Recall from Chapter 10 that perfectly competitive firms will hire additional factors of production
as long as their marginal revenue product exceeds their market price. As long as all firms have
access to the same factor markets and the same factor prices, the last unit of a factor hired will
produce the same value in each firm. Certainly, firms will use different technologies and factor
combinations, but at the margin, no single profit-maximizing firm can get more value out of a
factor than that factor’s current market price. For example, if workers can be hired in the labor
market at a wage of $6.50, all firms will hire workers as long as the marginal revenue product
(MRPL) produced by the marginal worker (labor’s MRPL) remains above $6.50. No firms will hire
labor beyond the point at which MRPL falls below $6.50. Thus, at equilibrium, additional work-
ers are not worth more than $6.50 to any firm, and switching labor from one firm to another will

260
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms
not produce output of any greater value to society. Each firm has hired the profit-maximizing
amount of labor. In short:
The assumptions that factor markets are competitive and open, that all firms pay the same
prices for inputs, and that all firms maximize profits lead to the conclusion that the alloca-
tion of resources among firms is efficient.
We all know that people have different tastes and preferences and that they will buy very
different things in very different combinations.As long as everyone shops freely in the same
markets, no redistribution of final outputs among people will make them better off. If you
and I buy in the same markets and pay the same prices and I buy what I want and you buy
what you want, we cannot possibly end up with the wrong combination of things. Free and
open markets are essential to this result.
You should now have a greater appreciation for the power of the price mechanism in a market
economy. Each individual firm needs only to make decisions about which inputs to use by looking at
its own labor, capital, and land productivity relative to their prices. But because all firms face identical
input prices, the market economy achieves efficient input use among firms. Prices are the instrument
of Adam Smith’s “invisible hand,”allowing for efficiency without explicit coordination or planning.
Efficient Distribution of Outputs Among Households
Even if the system is produc-
ing the right things and is doing so efficiently, these things still have to get to the right people. Just as
open, competitive factor markets ensure that firms do not end up with the wrong inputs, open, com-
petitive output markets ensure that households do not end up with the wrong goods and services.
Within the constraints imposed by income and wealth, households are free to choose among all
the goods and services available in output markets.A household will buy a good as long as that good
generates utility, or subjective value, greater than its market price. Utility value is revealed in market
behavior.You do not go out and buy something unless you are willing to pay at least the market price.
Remember that the value you place on any one good depends on what you must give up to
have that good. The trade-offs available to you depend on your budget constraint. The trade-offs
that are desirable depend on your preferences. If you buy a $300 iPhone, you may be giving up a
trip home. If I buy it, I may be giving up four new tires for my car. We have both revealed that the
iPhone is worth at least as much to us as all the other things that $300 can buy. As long as we are
free to choose among all the things that $300 can buy, we will not end up with the wrong things;
it is not possible to find a trade that will make us both better off. Again, the price mechanism
plays an important role. Each of us faces the same price for the goods that we choose, and that in
turn leads us to make choices that ensure that goods are allocated efficiently among consumers.
Producing What People Want: The Efficient Mix of Output
It does no good to
produce things efficiently or to distribute them efficiently if the system produces the wrong
things. Will competitive markets produce the things that people want?
If the system is producing the wrong mix of output, we should be able to show that produc-
ing more of one good and less of another will make people better off. To show that perfectly com-
petitive markets are efficient, we must demonstrate that no such changes in the final mix of
output are possible.
The condition that ensures that the right things are produced is P = MC. That is, in both the
long run and the short run, a perfectly competitive firm will produce at the point where the price
of its output is equal to the marginal cost of production. As long as price is above marginal cost,
it pays for a firm to increase output. The logic is this: When a firm weighs price and marginal cost,
it weighs the value of its product to society at the margin against the value of the things that could
otherwise be produced with the same resources. Figure 12.2 summarizes this logic.
The argument is quite straightforward. First, price reflects households’ willingness to pay. By pur-
chasing a good, individual households reveal that it is worth at least as much as the other goods that
the same money could buy. Thus, current price reflects the value that households place on a good.
Second, marginal cost reflects the opportunity cost of the resources needed to produce a good. If a
firm producing X hires a worker, it must pay the market wage. That wage must be sufficient to

If PX > MCX, society gains value by producing more X.
If PX < MCX, society gains value by producing less X.

 FIGURE 12.2 The Key Efficiency Condition: Price Equals Marginal Cost
attract that worker out of leisure or away from firms producing other goods. The same argument
holds for capital and land.
Thus, if the price of a good ends up greater than marginal cost, producing more of it will gen-
erate benefits to households in excess of opportunity costs, and society gains. Similarly,
if the price of a good ends up below marginal cost, resources are being used to produce something
that households value less than opportunity costs. Producing less of it creates gains to society.2
Society will produce the efficient mix of output if all firms equate price and marginal cost.
2 It is important to understand that firms do not act consciously to balance social costs and benefits. In fact, the usual assumption is that
firms are self-interested private profit maximizers. It just works out that in perfectly competitive markets, when firms are weighing pri-
vate benefits against private costs, they are actually (perhaps without knowing it) weighing the benefits and costs to society as well.
Figure 12.3 shows how a simple competitive market system leads individual households and
firms to make efficient choices in input and output markets. For simplicity, the figure assumes
only one factor of production, labor. Households weigh the market wage against the value of

leisure and time spent in unpaid household production. However, the wage is a measure of
labor’s potential product because firms weigh labor cost (wages) against the value of the product
produced and hire up to the point at which W = MRPL. Households use wages to buy market-
produced goods. Thus, households implicitly weigh the value of market-produced goods against
the value of leisure and household production.
When a firm’s scale is balanced, it is earning maximum profit; when a household’s scale is
balanced, it is maximizing utility. Under these conditions, no changes can improve social welfare.
Perfect Competition versus Real Markets
So far, we have built a model of a perfectly competitive market system that produces an efficient
allocation of resources, an efficient mix of output, and an efficient distribution of output. The
perfectly competitive model is built on a set of assumptions, all of which must hold for our con-
clusions to be fully valid. We have assumed that all firms and households are price-takers in input
and output markets, that firms and households have perfect information, and that all firms max-
imize profits.
These assumptions do not always hold in real-world markets. When this is the case, the conclu-
sion breaks down that free, unregulated markets will produce an efficient outcome. The remain-
der of this chapter discusses some inefficiencies that occur naturally in markets and some of the
strengths, as well as the weaknesses, of the market mechanism. We also discuss the usefulness of
the competitive model for understanding the real economy.
The Sources of Market Failure
In suggesting some of the problems encountered in real markets and some of the possible solu-
tions to these problems, the rest of this chapter previews the next part of this book, which focuses
on the economics of market failure and the potential role of government in the economy.
Market failure occurs when resources are misallocated, or allocated inefficiently. The result
is waste or lost value. In this section, we briefly describe four important sources of market failure:
(1) imperfect market structure, or noncompetitive behavior; (2) the existence of public goods;
(3) the presence of external costs and benefits; and (4) imperfect information. Each condition
results from the failure of one of the assumptions basic to the perfectly competitive model, and
each is discussed in more detail in later chapters. Each also points to a potential role for govern-
ment in the economy. The desirability and the extent of actual government involvement in the
economy are hotly debated subjects.
Imperfect Markets
One of the elements of the efficiency of a perfectly competitive market that we described is the effi-
cient mix of outputs. Society produces the right mix of goods given their costs and the preferences
of households in the economy. Efficient mix comes because products are sold at prices equal to
their marginal costs.
Think back to two goods, nuts and apples. For efficiency, we would like, in equilibrium, to
find that the relative prices of nuts and apples reflect their relative costs. If the marginal costs of
apples is twice that of nuts, efficiency means that consumption should be adjusted so that the rel-
ative price of apples is twice that of nuts. Otherwise, society does better in using its resources dif-
ferently. In a perfectly competitive market, this comes easily. If both goods are sold at prices equal
to their marginal costs, then the ratio of the prices of the two goods will also equal the ratio of the
marginal costs. Equilibrium in separate markets gives us efficiency in the general equilibrium set-
ting. But suppose one of the two goods is priced for some reason at a level in excess of its mar-
ginal costs. Now relative prices will no longer reflect relative costs.
So we can see that efficiency of output mix comes from marginal cost pricing. As we will
learn in the next few chapters, however, in imperfectly competitive markets, with fewer firms
competing and limited entry by new firms, prices will not necessarily equal marginal costs. As a
consequence, in a market with firms that have some market power, where firms do not behave as
price-takers, we are not guaranteed an efficient mix of output.

Occurs when
resources are misallocated, or
allocated inefficiently. The
result is waste or lost value.

CHAPTER 12
General Equilibrium and the Efficiency of Perfect Competition 263
Public Goods
A second major source of inefficiency lies in the fact that private producers may not find it in
their best interest to produce everything that members of society want because for one reason or
another they are unable to charge prices to reflect values people place on those goods. More
specifically, there is a whole class of goods and services called public goods or social goods, that
will be underproduced or not produced at all in a completely unregulated market economy.3
Public goods are goods and services that bestow collective benefits on society; they are, in a sense,
collectively consumed. The classic example is national defense, but there are countless others—police
protection, homeland security, preservation of wilderness lands, and public health, to name a few.
These things are “produced”using land,labor,and capital just like any other good.Some public goods,
such as national defense, benefit the whole nation. Others, such as clean air, may be limited to smaller
areas—the air may be clean in a Kansas town but dirty in a Southern California city.Public goods are
consumed by everyone,not just by those who pay for them.The inability to exclude nonpayers from
consumption of a public good makes it, not surprisingly, hard to charge people a price for the good.
If the provision of public goods were left to private profit-seeking producers with no power
to force payment, a serious problem would arise. Suppose, for example, you value some public
good, X. If there were a functioning market for X, you would be willing to pay for X. Suppose you
are asked to contribute voluntarily to the production of X. Should you contribute? Perhaps you
should on moral grounds, but not on the basis of pure self-interest.
At least two problems can get in the way. First, because you cannot be excluded from using X
for not paying, you get the good whether you pay or not. Why should you pay if you do not have
to? Second, because public goods that provide collective benefits to large numbers of people are
expensive to produce, any one person’s contribution is not likely to make much difference to the
amount of the good ultimately produced. Would the national defense suffer, for example, if you
did not pay your share of the bill? Probably not. Thus, nothing happens if you do not pay. The
output of the good does not change much, and you get it whether you pay or not. Private provi-
sion of public goods fails. A completely laissez-faire market system will not produce everything
that all members of a society might want. Citizens must band together to ensure that desired
public goods are produced, and this is generally accomplished through government spending
financed by taxes. Public goods are the subject of Chapter 16.
Externalities
A third major source of inefficiency is the existence of external costs and benefits. An externality
is a cost or benefit imposed or bestowed on an individual or a group that is outside, or external to,
the transaction—in other words, something that affects a third party. In a city, external costs are
pervasive. The classic example is air or water pollution, but there are thousands of others, such as
noise, congestion, and your house painted a color that the neighbors think is ugly. Global warm-
ing is an externality at the level of the world.
Not all externalities are negative, however. For example, housing investment may yield bene-
fits for neighbors. A farm located near a city provides residents in the area with nice views and a
less congested environment.
Externalities are a problem only if decision makers do not take them into account. The logic of
efficiency presented earlier in this chapter required that firms weigh social benefits against social costs.
If a firm in a competitive environment produces a good, it is because the value of that good to society
exceeds the social cost of producing it—this is the logic of P = MC. If social costs or benefits are over-
looked or left out of the calculations, inefficient decisions result. In essence, if the calculation of either
MC or P in the equation is “wrong,”equating the two will clearly not lead to an optimal result.
The effects of externalities can be enormous. For years, companies piled chemical wastes
indiscriminately into dump sites near water supplies and residential areas. In some locations,
those wastes seeped into the ground and contaminated the drinking water. In response to the evi-
dence that smoking damages not only the smoker but also others, governments have increased
prohibitions against smoking on airplanes and in public places.

264
PART II
The Market System:  Choices Made by Households and Firms
Imperfect Information
The fourth major source of inefficiency is imperfect information on the part of buyers and sell-
ers. The conclusion that markets work efficiently rests heavily on the assumption that consumers
and producers have full knowledge of product characteristics, available prices, and so on. The
absence of full information can lead to transactions that are ultimately disadvantageous.
Some products are so complex that consumers find it difficult to judge the potential benefits
and costs of purchase. Buyers of life insurance have a very difficult time sorting out the terms of
the more complex policies and determining the true “price” of the product. Consumers of almost
any service that requires expertise, such as plumbing and medical care, have a hard time evaluat-
ing what is needed, much less how well it is done. With imperfect information, prices may no
longer reflect individual preferences.
Some forms of misinformation can be corrected with simple rules such as truth-in-advertising
regulations. In some cases, the government provides information to citizens; job banks and con-
sumer information services exist for this purpose. In certain industries, such as medical care, there
is no clear-cut solution to the problem of noninformation or misinformation. We discuss all these
topics in detail in Chapter 16.
Evaluating the Market Mechanism
Is the market system good or bad? Should the government be involved in the economy, or should
it leave the allocation of resources to the free market? So far, our information is mixed and
incomplete. To the extent that the perfectly competitive model reflects the way markets really
operate, there seem to be some clear advantages to the market system.When we relax the assump-
tions and expand our discussion to include noncompetitive behavior, public goods, externalities,
and the possibility of imperfect information, we see at least a potential role for government.
The market system may not provide participants with the incentive to weigh costs and
benefits and to operate efficiently. If there are no externalities or if such costs or benefits are
properly internalized, firms will weigh social benefits and costs in their production decisions.
Under these circumstances, the profit motive should provide competitive firms with an incentive
to minimize cost and to produce their products using the most efficient technologies. Likewise,
competitive input markets should provide households with the incentive to weigh the value of
their time against the social value of what they can produce in the labor force.
However, markets are far from perfect. Freely functioning markets in the real world do not
always produce an efficient allocation of resources,and this result provides a potential role for gov-
ernment in the economy. Many have called for government involvement in the economy to correct
for market failure—that is, to help markets function more efficiently. As you will see, however,
many believe that government involvement in the economy creates more inefficiency than it cures.
In addition, we have thus far discussed only the criterion of efficiency, but economic systems
and economic policies must be judged by many other criteria, not the least of which is equity, or
fairness. Indeed, some contend that the outcome of any free market is ultimately unfair because
some become rich while others remain poor.
Part III, which follows, explores in greater depth the issue of market imperfections and gov-
ernment involvement in the economy.

1. Both firms and households make simultaneous choices in
input and output markets. For example, input prices deter-
mine output costs and affect firms’ output supply decisions.
Wages in the labor market affect labor supply decisions,
income, and ultimately the amount of output households
can and do purchase.
2. A general equilibrium exists when all markets in an economy
are in simultaneous equilibrium. An event that disturbs the
equilibrium in one market may disturb the equilibrium in
many other markets as well. Partial equilibrium analysis can
be misleading because it looks only at adjustments in one
isolated market.

EQUILIBRIUM p. 256
4. An efficient economy is one that produces the goods and ser-
vices that people want at the least possible cost. A change is
said to be efficient if it makes some members of society better
off without making others worse off. An efficient, or Pareto
optimal, system is one in which no such changes are possible.
5. If a change makes some people better off and some people
worse off but it can be shown that the value of the gains
exceeds the value of the losses, the change is said to be
potentially efficient or simply efficient.
6. If all the assumptions of perfect competition hold, the result
is an efficient, or Pareto optimal, allocation of resources. To
prove this statement, it is necessary to show that resources
are allocated efficiently among firms, that final products are
distributed efficiently among households, and that the sys-
tem produces what people want.
7. The assumptions that factor markets are competitive and
open, that all firms pay the same prices for inputs, and that
all firms maximize profits lead to the conclusion that the
allocation of resources among firms is efficient.
8. People have different tastes and preferences, and they buy
very different things in very different combinations. As long
as everyone shops freely in the same markets, no redistribu-
tion of outputs among people will make them better off.
This leads to the conclusion that final products are distrib-
uted efficiently among households.
9. Because perfectly competitive firms will produce as long as
the price of their product is greater than the marginal cost of
production, they will continue to produce as long as a gain
for society is possible. The market thus guarantees that the
right things are produced. In other words, the perfectly com-
petitive system produces what people want.
THE SOURCES OF MARKET FAILURE p. 262 
10. When the assumptions of perfect competition do not hold,
the conclusion breaks down that free, unregulated markets
will produce an efficient allocation of resources.
11. An imperfectly competitive industry is one in which single
firms have some control over price and competition. In all
imperfectly competitive industries, output is lower and price
is higher than they would be in perfect competition. Imperfect
competition is a major source of market inefficiency.
12. Public, or social, goods bestow collective benefits on members
of society. Because the benefits of social goods are collective,
people cannot, in most cases, be excluded from enjoying
them. Thus, private firms usually do not find it profitable to
produce public goods. The need for public goods is thus
another source of inefficiency.
13. An externality is a cost or benefit that is imposed or
bestowed on an individual or a group that is outside, or
external to, the transaction. If such social costs or benefits
are overlooked, the decisions of households or firms are
likely to be wrong or inefficient.
14. Market efficiency depends on the assumption that buyers have
perfect information on product quality and price and that firms
have perfect information on input quality and price. Imperfect
information can lead to wrong choices and inefficiency.
EVALUATING THE MARKET MECHANISM p. 264 
15. Sources of market failure—such as imperfect markets, public
goods, externalities, and imperfect information—are consid-
ered by many to justify the existence of government and gov-
ernmental policies that seek to redistribute costs and income
on the basis of efficiency, equity, or both.

decrees requiring large companies to break up into smaller
competing companies for violating the antitrust laws. The two
best-known examples are American Telephone and Telegraph

broken up into the “Baby Bells”; but the Microsoft breakup was
successfully appealed, and the breakup never occurred.)
Many argue that breaking up a monopoly is a Pareto-efficient
change. This interpretation cannot be so because breaking up a

Economics in Practice in this chapter describes the adjustment of
the corn and wheat markets to the massive U.S. subsidy given to
ethanol production. The subsidy drives up the prices of other
agricultural goods such as wheat and substantially raises the
value of farmland. How would this story change if oil prices
were to rise extensively at the same time? if oil prices were to
fall? Trace these changes on the economy using supply and
demand curves.

the city. They are also buying smaller units. This will have a
big effect on owners of suburban homes who find their
home values falling.
c. In 2007–2008, the mortgage markets crashed. This led to a
serious decline in the availability of credit to buyers who, a
couple of years ago, were able to borrow far more than
they needed.
4. A medium-sized bakery has just opened in Slovakia. A loaf of
bread is currently selling for 14 koruna (the Slovakian currency)
over and above the cost of intermediate goods (flour, yeast, and
so on). Assuming that labor is the only variable factor of pro-
duction, the following table gives the production function for
the bread.

a. Suppose the current wage rate in Slovakia is 119 koruna per
hour. How many workers will the bakery employ?
b. Suppose the economy of Slovakia begins to grow, incomes
rise, and the price of a loaf of bread is pushed up to
20 koruna. Assuming no increase in the price of labor, how
many workers will the bakery hire?
c. An increase in the demand for labor pushes up wages to
125 koruna per hour. What impact will this increase in
cost have on employment and output in the bakery at the
20-koruna price of bread?
d. If all firms behaved like our bakery, would the allocation of
resources in Slovakia be efficient? Explain your answer.
5. Country A has soil that is suited to corn production and yields
135 bushels per acre. Country B has soil that is not suited for
corn and yields only 45 bushels per acre. Country A has soil
that is not suited for soybean production and yields 15 bushels
per acre. Country B has soil that is suited for soybeans and
yields 35 bushels per acre. In 2004, there was no trade between
A and B because of high taxes and both countries together pro-
duced huge quantities of corn and soybeans. In 2005, taxes
were eliminated because of a new trade agreement. What is
likely to happen? Can you justify the trade agreement on the
basis of Pareto efficiency? Why or why not?
6. Do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements?
Explain your answer.
a. Housing is a public good and should be produced by the public
sector because private markets will fail to produce it efficiently.
b. Monopoly power is inefficient because large firms will pro-
duce too much product, dumping it on the market at artifi-
cially low prices.
c. Medical care is an example of a potentially inefficient market
because consumers do not have perfect information about
the product.
7. The point of scalping is to find someone who wants a ticket more
than the person who presently has it.Whenever two different prices
exist in a market, arbitrage opportunities (buy and then sell at a
higher price) are there. Professional scalpers buy up tickets when
they are first offered to the public, while some buy them on the
street the night of the event. They can sell any ticket, even those in
short supply, at some price.When many people want to go to an
event that has a limited supply of tickets, the scalping price can be
quite high. Go online and find scalping agencies like Stub-Hub and
Ace Tickets. See if you can find an event for which the scalping
price is much higher than the original price.What determines
whether the event is worth the higher price? 
It is argued that scalping is efficient. Explain that argument.
Others ask how could it be efficient “if only rich people can afford
to go to most games?” Do you agree? Why or why not?
8. Which of the following are examples of Pareto-efficient
changes? Explain your answers.
a. Cindy trades her laptop computer to Bob for his old car.
b. Competition is introduced into the electric industry, and
electricity rates drop. A study shows that benefits to con-
sumers are larger than the lost monopoly profits.
c. A high tax on wool sweaters deters buyers. The tax is repealed.
d. A federal government agency is reformed, and costs are cut
23 percent with no loss of service quality.
9. A major source of chicken feed in the United States is
anchovies, small fish that can be scooped out of the ocean at
low cost. Every 7 years, when the anchovies disappear to
spawn, producers must turn to grain, which is more expensive,
to feed their chickens. What is likely to happen to the cost of
chicken when the anchovies disappear? What are substitutes
for chicken? How are the markets for these substitutes
affected? Name some complements to chicken. How are the
markets for these complements affected? How might the allo-
cation of farmland be changed as a result of the disappearance
of anchovies?
10. Suppose two passengers end up with a reservation for the last
seat on a train from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Two alterna-
tives are proposed:
a. Toss a coin
b. Sell the ticket to the highest bidder
Compare the two options from the standpoint of efficiency 
and equity.
11. Assume that there are two sectors in an economy: goods (G)
and services (S). Both sectors are perfectly competitive, with
large numbers of firms and constant returns to scale. As income
rises, households spend a larger portion of their income on S
and a smaller portion on G. Using supply and demand curves
for both sectors and a diagram showing a representative firm in

CHAPTER 12

each sector, explain what would happen to output and prices in
the short run and the long run in response to an increase in
income. (Assume that the increase in income causes demand for
G to shift left and demand for S to shift right.) In the long run,
what would happen to employment in the goods sector? in the
service sector? (Hint: See Figure 12.2 on p. 261.)
12. Which of the following are actual Pareto-efficient changes?
Explain briefly.
a. You buy three oranges for $1 from a street vendor.
b. You are near death from thirst in the desert and must pay a
passing vagabond $10,000 for a glass of water.
c. A mugger steals your wallet.
d. You take a taxi ride in downtown Manhattan during rush hour.
13. Each instance that follows is an example of one of the four types
of market failure discussed in this chapter. In each case, identify
the type of market failure and defend your choice briefly.
a. An auto repair shop convinces you that you need a $2,000
valve job when all you really need is an oil change.
b. Everyone in a neighborhood would benefit if an empty lot
were turned into a park, but no entrepreneur will come for-
ward to finance the transformation.
c. A bar opens next to your apartment building and plays loud
music on its patio every night until 4 A.M.
d. The only two airlines flying direct between St. Louis and
Atlanta make an agreement to raise their prices.
14. Two factories in the same town hire workers with the same
skills. Union agreements require factory A to pay its workers
$10 per hour, while factory B must pay $6 per hour. Each fac-
tory hires the profit-maximizing number of workers. Is the allo-
cation of labor between these two factories efficient? Explain
why or why not.
15. Explain why resources are allocated efficiently among firms and
why output is distributed efficiently among households in per-
fectly competitive markets.
16. Under what condition would society benefit from more of a
good being produced, and under what condition would society
benefit from less of a good being produced?
17. James lives on a cul-de-sac where he and all his neighbors park
on the street. After his car was vandalized, James decided to
install motion-sensitive lighting on the front of his house. Now
any movement activates the lights, which shine across the entire
parking area on the street. Explain why the installation of the
lights might lead to an inefficient outcome.
18. Briefly explain whether each of the following represents a pub-
lic good.
a. A chef salad sold at the cafeteria in the county courthouse
b. Palm trees planted along the median of the Pacific
Coast Highway
c. A Doppler radar station built at Chicago’s O’Hare

In 1911 the U.S. Supreme Court found that Standard
Oil of New Jersey, the largest oil company in the
United States, was a monopoly and ordered that it be
divided up. In 1999 a U.S. court similarly found that
Microsoft had exercised monopoly power and
ordered it to change a series of its business practices.
In 2010 the Federal Trade Commission—one of the
government agencies empowered to protect
consumers—argued that Google possessed monop-
oly power and should also be restrained by the gov-
ernment in its business practices.What do we mean by a monopoly, and why might the government
and the courts try to control monopolists? Have our ideas on what constitutes a monopoly changed
over time with new technology?
In earlier chapters, we described in some detail the workings and benefits of perfect
competition. Market competition among firms producing undifferentiated or homogeneous
products limits the choices of firms. Firms decide how much to produce and how to pro-
duce, but in setting prices, they look to the market. Moreover, because of entry and competi-
tion, firms do no better than earn the opportunity cost of capital in the long run. For firms
such as Google and Microsoft, economic decision making is richer and so is the potential for
profit making.
In the next three chapters, we explore markets in which competition is limited, either by the
fewness of firms or by product differentiation. After a brief discussion of market structure in gen-
eral, this chapter will focus on monopoly markets. Chapter 14 will cover oligopolies, while
Chapter 15 will deal with monopolistic competition.
Imperfect Competition and Market Power:
Core Concepts
In the competitive markets we have been studying all firms charge the same price. With many
firms producing identical or homogeneous products, consumers have many choices, and those
choices constrain the pricing of individual firms. This same competition also means that firms in
the long run earn only a normal return on their capital. In imperfectly competitive markets, on
the other hand, the absence of numerous competitors or the existence of product differentiation
creates situations in which firms can at times raise their prices and not lose all their customers.
These firms can be said to have market power. In these markets we may observe firms earning
excess profits, and we may see firms producing different variants of a product and charging dif-
ferent prices for those variants. Studying these markets is especially interesting because we now
have to think not only about pricing behavior, but also about how firms choose product quality
and type.

The Boundary of a
Market and Elasticity
We can define an industry as
broadly or as narrowly as we like.
The more broadly we define the
industry, the fewer substitutes
there are; thus, the less elastic
the demand for that industry’s
product is likely to be. A monop-
oly is an industry with one firm
that produces a product for
which there are no close substitutes.
The producer of Brand X ham-
burger cannot properly be called
a monopolist because this pro-
ducer has no control over market
price and there are many substi-
tutes for Brand X hamburger.
Forms of Imperfect Competition and Market Boundaries
Once we move away from perfectly competitive markets, with its assumption of many firms and
undifferentiated products, there is a range of other possible market structures. At one extreme
lies the monopoly. A monopoly is an industry with a single firm in which the entry of new firms
is blocked. An oligopoly is an industry in which there is a small number of firms, each large
enough so that its presence affects prices. Firms that differentiate their products in industries
with many producers and free entry are called monopolistic competitors. We begin our discussion
in this chapter with monopoly.
What do we mean when we say that a monopoly firm is the only firm in the industry? In
practice, given the prevalence of branding, many firms, especially in the consumer products mar-
kets, are alone in producing a specific product. Procter & Gamble (P&G), for example, is the only
producer of Ivory soap. Coca-Cola is the only producer of Coke Classic. And yet we would call
neither firm monopolistic because for both, many other firms produce products that are close
substitutes. Instead of drinking Coke, we could drink Pepsi; instead of washing with Ivory, we
could wash with Dove. To be meaningful, therefore, our definition of a monopolistic industry
must be more precise. We define a pure monopoly as an industry (1) with a single firm that pro-
duces a product for which there are no close substitutes and (2) in which significant barriers to
entry prevent other firms from entering the industry to compete for profits.
As we think about the issue of product substitutes and market power, it is useful to recall the
structure of the competitive market. Consider a firm producing an undifferentiated brand of
hamburger meat, Brand X hamburger. As we show in Figure 13.1 the demand this firm faces is
horizontal, perfectly elastic. The demand for hamburgers as a whole, however, likely slopes down.
While there are substitutes for hamburgers, they are not perfect and some people will continue to
consume hamburgers even if they cost more than other foods. As we broaden the category we are
considering, the substitution possibilities outside the category fall, and demand becomes quite
inelastic, as for example for food in general. If a firm were the only producer of Brand X ham-
burger, it would have no market power: If it raised its price, people would just switch to Brand Z
hamburger. A firm that produced all the hamburgers in the United States, on the other hand,
might have some market power: It could perhaps charge more than other beef-product producers
and still sell hamburgers. A firm that controlled all of the food in the United States would likely
have substantial market power since we all must eat!
In practice, figuring out which products are close substitutes for one another to deter-
mine market power can be difficult. Are hamburgers and hot dogs close substitutes so that a
hamburger monopoly would have little power to raise prices? Are debit cards and checks close

substitutes for credit cards so that credit card firms have little market power? The courts in a
recent antitrust case said no. Is Microsoft a monopoly, or does it compete with Linux and
Apple for software users?  These are questions that occupy considerable time for economists,
lawyers, and the antitrust courts. The Economics in Practice on p. 287 discusses the antitrust
rules that pertain to the National Football League.
Price and Output Decisions in Pure
Monopoly Markets
Consider a market with a single firm producing a good for which there are few substitutes. How
does this profit-maximizing monopolist choose its output levels? At this point we assume the
monopolist cannot price-discriminate. It sells its product to all demanders at the same price. (Price
discrimination means selling to different consumers or groups of consumers at different prices and
will be discussed later in this chapter.)
Assume initially that our pure monopolist buys in competitive input markets. Even though
the firm is the only one producing for its product market, it is only one among many firms buy-
ing factors of production in input markets. The local telephone company must hire labor like any
other firm. To attract workers, the company must pay the market wage; to buy fiber-optic cable,
it must pay the going price. In these input markets, the monopolistic firm is a price-taker.
On the cost side of the profit equation, a pure monopolist does not differ from a perfect
competitor. Both choose the technology that minimizes the cost of production. The cost curve of
each represents the minimum cost of producing each level of output. The difference arises on the
revenue, or demand, side of the equation, where we begin our analysis.
Demand in Monopoly Markets
A perfectly competitive firm, you will recall, can sell all it wants to sell at the market price. The
firm is a small part of the market. The demand curve facing such a firm is thus a horizontal line.
Raising the price of its product means losing all demand because perfect substitutes are available.
The perfectly competitive firm has no incentive to charge a lower price either since it can sell all it
wants at the market price.
A monopolist is different. It does not constitute a small part of the market; it is the mar-
ket. The firm no longer looks at a market price to see what it can charge; it sets the market
price. How does it do so? Even a firm that is a monopolist in its own market will nevertheless
compete with other firms in other markets for a consumer’s dollars. Even a monopolist thus
loses some customers when it raises its price. The monopolist sets its price by looking at the
trade-off in terms of profit earned between getting more money for each unit sold versus sell-
ing fewer units.
Shortly we will look at exactly how a monopolist thinks about this trade-off. But before
we become more formal, it is interesting to think about the business decisions of the com-
petitive firm versus a monopolist. For a competitive firm, the market provides a lot of infor-
mation; in effect, all the firm needs to do is figure out if, given its costs, it can make money at
the current market price. A monopolist needs to learn about the demand curve for its prod-
uct. When the iPod first came out, Apple had to figure out how much individuals would be
willing to pay for this new product. What did its demand curve look like? Firms like Apple
have quite sophisticated marketing departments that survey potential consumers, collect data
from related markets, and even do a bit of trial and error to learn what their demand curves
really look like.
Marginal Revenue and Market Demand
We learned in Chapter 7 that the com-
petitive firm maximizes its profit by continuing to produce output so long as marginal rev-
enue exceeds marginal cost. Under these conditions, incremental units add more to the plus,
or revenue, side than they add to the minus, or cost, side. The same general rule is true for the
monopolist: A monopolist too will maximize profits by expanding output so long as marginal

272
PART  III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
revenue exceeds marginal cost. The key difference in the two cases lies in the definition of
marginal revenue.
For a competitive firm marginal revenue is simply the price, as we discussed in Chapter 7.
Every unit that the firm sells, it sells at the going market price. The competitive firm is a very
small part of the overall market, and its behavior has no effect on the overall market price. So
the incremental or marginal revenue from each new unit sold is simply the price. In the case of
a monopolist, however, the monopolist is the market. If that firm decides to double its output,
market output will double, and it is easy to see that the only way the firm will be able to sell twice
the output is to lower its price. The fact that a monopolist's output decisions influence market
prices means that price and marginal revenue will diverge. The simplest way to see this is via a
bit of arithmetic.
Consider the hypothetical demand schedule in Table 13.1. Column 3 lists the total revenue
that the monopoly would take in at different levels of output. If it were to produce 1 unit, that
unit would sell for $10, and total revenue would be $10. Two units would sell for $9 each, in
which case total revenue would be $18. As column 4 shows, marginal revenue from the second
unit would be $8 ($18 minus $10). Notice that the marginal revenue from increasing output from
1 unit to 2 units ($8) is less than the price of the second unit ($9).

Now consider what happens when the firm considers setting production at 4 units
instead of 3. The fourth unit would sell for $7, but because the firm cannot price discrimi-
nate, it must sell all 4 units for $7 each. Had the firm chosen to produce only 3 units, it
could have sold those 3 units for $8 each. Thus, offsetting the revenue gain of $7 is a revenue
loss of $3—that is, $1 for each of the 3 units that would have sold at the higher price. The
marginal revenue of the fourth unit is $7 minus $3, or $4, which is considerably below the
price of $7. (Remember, unlike a monopoly, a perfectly competitive firm does not have to
charge a lower price to sell more. Thus, P = MR in competition.) For a monopolist, an
increase in output involves not only producing more and selling it, but also reducing the
overall price of its output.
Marginal revenue can also be derived by looking at the change in total revenue as output
changes by 1 unit. At 3 units of output, total revenue is $24. At 4 units of output, total revenue is
$28. Marginal revenue is the difference, or $4.
Moving from 6 to 7 units of output actually reduces total revenue for the firm. At 7 units,
marginal revenue is negative. Although it is true that the seventh unit will sell for a positive
price ($4), the firm must sell all 7 units for $4 each (for a total revenue of $28). If output had
been restricted to 6 units, each would have sold for $5. Thus, offsetting the revenue gain of $4
is a revenue loss of $6—that is, $1 for each of the 6 units that the firm would have sold at the
higher price. Increasing output from 6 to 7 units actually decreases revenue by $2. Figure 13.2

 FIGURE 13.2 Marginal Revenue Curve Facing a Monopolist
At every level of output except 1 unit, a monopolist’s marginal revenue (MR) is below price. This is so
because (1) we assume that the monopolist must sell all its product at a single price (no price discrimina-
tion) and (2) to raise output and sell it, the firm must lower the price it charges. Selling the additional output
will raise revenue, but this increase is offset somewhat by the lower price charged for all units sold. Therefore,
the increase in revenue from increasing output by 1 (the marginal revenue) is less than the price.
1 Recall from Chapter 4 that if the percentage change in Q is greater than the percentage change in P as you move along a
demand curve, the absolute value of elasticity of demand is greater than 1. Thus, as we move along the demand curve in
Figure 13.3 between point A and point B, demand is elastic.
graphs the marginal revenue schedule derived in Table 13.1. Notice that at every level of output
except 1 unit, marginal revenue is below price. Marginal revenue turns from positive to nega-
tive after 6 units of output. When the demand curve is a straight line, the marginal revenue
curve bisects the quantity axis between the origin and the point where the demand curve hits
the quantity axis, as in Figure 13.3.
Look carefully at Figure 13.3. The marginal revenue curve shows the change in total revenue
that results as a firm moves along the segment of the demand curve that lies directly above it.
Consider starting at a price in excess of point A per period in the top panel of Figure 13.3. Here
total revenue (shown in the bottom panel) is zero because nothing is sold. To begin selling, the
firm must lower the product price. Marginal revenue is positive, and total revenue begins to
increase. To sell increasing quantities of the good, the firm must lower its price more and more.
As output increases between zero and Q* and the firm moves down its demand curve from point A
to point B, marginal revenue remains positive and total revenue continues to increase. The quan-
tity of output (Q) is rising, which tends to push total revenue (P  Q) up. At the same time, the
price of output (P) is falling, which tends to push total revenue (P  Q) down. Up to point B, the
effect of increasing Q dominates the effect of falling P and total revenue rises: Marginal revenue is
positive (above the quantity axis).1
What happens as we look at output levels greater than Q*—that is, farther down the
demand curve from point B toward point C? We are still lowering P to sell more output, but at
levels greater than Q*, marginal revenue is negative, and total revenue in the bottom panel starts
to fall. Beyond Q*, the effect of cutting price on total revenue is larger than the effect of

terms than the increase in quantity. Thus, the absolute value of elasticity beyond point B is less than 1: Demand is inelastic. At
point B, marginal revenue is zero; the decrease in P exactly offsets the increase in Q, and elasticity is unitary or equal to -1.
increasing quantity. As a result, total revenue (P  Q) falls. At point C, revenue once again is at
zero, this time because price has dropped to zero.2
The Monopolist’s Profit-Maximizing Price and Output
We have spent much
time defining and explaining marginal revenue because it is an important factor in the monopo-
list’s choice of profit-maximizing price and output. Figure 13.4 superimposes a demand curve
and the marginal revenue curve derived from it over a set of cost curves. In determining price and
output, a monopolistic firm must go through the same basic decision process that a competitive
firm goes through. Any profit-maximizing firm will raise its production as long as the added rev-
enue from the increase outweighs the added cost. All firms, including monopolies, raise output as
long as marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost. Any positive difference between marginal
revenue and marginal cost can be thought of as marginal profit.

CHAPTER 13
Monopoly and Antitrust Policy 275
The optimal price/output combination for the monopolist in Figure 13.4 is Pm = $6 and
Qm = 5 units, the quantity at which the marginal revenue curve and the marginal cost curve
intersect. At any output below 5, marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost. At any output
above 5, increasing output would reduce profits because marginal cost exceeds marginal rev-
enue. This leads us to conclude that the profit-maximizing level of output for a monopolist is
the one at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost: MR = MC.
Because marginal revenue for a monopoly lies below the demand curve, the final price cho-
sen by the monopolist will be above marginal cost. (Pm = $6.00 is greater than MC = $2.00.) At 
5 units of output, price will be fixed at $6 (point A on the demand curve), which is as much as the
market will bear, and total revenue will be Pm  Qm = $6  5 = $30 (area PmAQm0). Total cost is
the product of average total cost and units of output, $4.50  5 = $22.50 (area CBQm0). Total
profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost, $30 - $22.50 = $7.50. In Figure 13.4,
total profit is the area of the gray rectangle PmABC.
Our discussion about the optimal output level for a monopolist points to a common mis-
conception. Even monopolists face constraints on the prices they can charge. Suppose a single
firm controlled the production of bicycles. That firm would be able to charge more than could be
charged in a competitive marketplace, but the power to raise prices has limits. As the bike price
rises, we will see more people buying inline skates or walking. A particularly interesting case
comes from monopolists who sell durable goods, goods that last for some period of time.
Microsoft is the only producer for Windows, the operating system that dominates the personal
computer (PC) market. But when Microsoft tries to sell a new version of that operating system
(for example, Windows 7, which it introduced in 2010), its price is constrained by the fact that
many of the potential consumers it seeks already have an old operating system. If the new price is
too high, consumers will stay with the older version. Some monopolists may face quite elastic
demand curves as a result of the characteristics of the product they sell.
The Absence of a Supply Curve in Monopoly
In perfect competition, the supply
curve of a firm in the short run is the same as the portion of the firm’s marginal cost curve that
lies above the average variable cost curve. As the price of the good produced by the firm changes,
the perfectly competitive firm simply moves up or down its marginal cost curve in choosing how
much output to produce.
As you can see, however, Figure 13.4 contains nothing that we can point to and call a supply
curve. The amount of output that a monopolist produces depends on its marginal cost curve and
on the shape of the demand curve that it faces. In other words, the amount of output that a
monopolist supplies is not independent of the shape of the demand curve. A monopoly firm has
no supply curve that is independent of the demand curve for its product.
To see why, consider what a firm’s supply curve means. A supply curve shows the quantity of
output the firm is willing to supply at each price. If we ask a monopolist how much output she is

willing to supply at a given price, the monopolist will say that her supply behavior depends not
only on marginal cost but also on the marginal revenue associated with that price. To know what
that marginal revenue would be, the monopolist must know what her demand curve looks like.
In sum, in perfect competition, we can draw a firm’s supply curve without knowing anything
more than the firm’s marginal cost curve. The situation for a monopolist is more complicated: A
monopolist sets both price and quantity, and the amount of output that it supplies depends on its
marginal cost curve and the demand curve that it faces.
Perfect Competition and Monopoly Compared
One way to understand monopoly is to compare equilibrium output and price in a perfectly
competitive industry with the output and price that would be chosen if the same industry were
organized as a monopoly. To make this comparison meaningful, let us exclude from considera-
tion any technological advantage that a single large firm might enjoy.
We begin our comparison with a perfectly competitive industry made up of a large number
of firms operating with a production technology that exhibits constant returns to scale in the
long run. (Recall that constant returns to scale means that average cost is the same whether the
firm operates one large plant or many small plants.) Figure 13.5 shows a perfectly competitive
industry at long-run equilibrium, a condition in which price is equal to long-run average costs
and in which there are no profits.
Suppose the industry were to fall under the control of a single price monopolist. The
monopolist now owns one firm with many plants. However, technology has not changed, only
the location of decision-making power has. To analyze the monopolist’s decisions, we must
derive the consolidated cost curves now facing the monopoly.
The marginal cost curve of the new monopoly will be the horizontal sum of the marginal
cost curves of the smaller firms, which are now branches of the larger firm. That is, to get the
large firm’s MC curve, at each level of MC, we add together the output quantities from each sep-
arate plant. To understand why, consider this simple example. Suppose there is perfect competi-
tion and the industry is made up of just two small firms, A and B, each with upward-sloping
marginal cost curves. Suppose for firm A, MC = $5 at an output of 10,000 units and for firm B,
MC = $5 at an output of 20,000 units. If these firms were merged, what would be the marginal
cost of the 30,000th unit of output per period? The answer is $5 because the new larger firm

In a perfectly competitive industry in the long run, price will be equal to long-run average cost. The market
supply curve is the sum of all the short-run marginal cost curves of the firms in the industry. Here we
assume that firms are using a technology that exhibits constant returns to scale: LRAC is flat. Big firms
enjoy no cost advantage.

CHAPTER 13
Monopoly and Antitrust Policy 277
would produce 10,000 units in plant A and 20,000 in plant B. This means that the marginal cost
curve of the new firm is exactly the same curve as the supply curve in the industry when it was
competitively organized. (Recall from Chapter 9 that the industry supply curve in a perfectly
competitive industry is the sum of the marginal cost curves [above average variable cost] of all
the individual firms in that industry.)3
Figure 13.6 illustrates the cost curves, marginal revenue curve, and demand curve of the
consolidated monopoly industry. If the industry were competitively organized, total industry
output would have been Qc = 4,000 and price would have been Pc = $3. These price and output
decisions are determined by the intersection of the competitive supply curve, Sc, and the market
demand curve.
No longer faced with a price that it cannot influence, however, the monopolist can choose any
price/quantity combination along the demand curve. The output level that maximizes profits to
the monopolist is Qm = 2,500—the point at which marginal revenue intersects marginal cost.
Output will be priced at Pm = $4. To increase output beyond 2,500 units or to charge a price below
$4 (which represents the amount consumers are willing to pay) would reduce profit. Relative to a
perfectly competitive industry, a monopolist restricts output, charges higher prices, and earns pos-
itive profits. In the long run, the monopolist will close plants.
Also remember that all we did was transfer decision-making power from the individual small
firms to a consolidated owner. The new firm gains nothing technologically by being big.

for a Firm with Constant Returns to Scale
In the newly organized monopoly, the marginal cost curve is the same as the supply curve that represented
the behavior of all the independent firms when the industry was organized competitively. Quantity produced
by the monopoly will be less than the perfectly competitive level of output, and the monopoly price will be
higher than the price under perfect competition. Under monopoly, P = Pm = $4 and Q = Qm = 2,500. Under
perfect competition, P = Pc = $3 and Q = Qc = 4,000.
3 The same logic will show that the average cost curve of the consolidated firm is the sum of the average cost curves of the indi-
vidual plants.
Monopoly in the Long Run: Barriers to Entry
What will happen to a monopoly in the long run? Of course, it is possible for a monopolist to suffer
losses.Just because a firm is the only producer in a market does not guarantee that anyone will buy its
product. Monopolists can end up going out of business just like competitive firms. If, on the con-
trary, the monopolist is earning positive profits (a rate of return above the normal return to capital),
as in Figure 13.4, we would expect other firms to enter as they do in competitive markets. In fact,

278
PART  III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
many markets that end up competitive begin with an entrepreneurial idea and a short-lived monop-
oly position.In the mid-1970s,a California entrepreneur named Gary Dahl“invented”and marketed
the Pet Rock. Dahl had the market to himself for about 6 months, during which time he earned mil-
lions before scores of competitors entered,driving down the price and profits.(In the end,this prod-
uct, perhaps not surprisingly, disappeared). For a monopoly to persist, some factor or factors must
prevent entry.We turn now to a discussion of those factors, commonly termed barriers to entry.
Return for a moment to Figure 13.4 on p. 275. In that graph, we see that the monopolist is
earning a positive economic profit. Such profits can persist only if other firms cannot enter this
industry and compete them away. The term barriers to entry is used to describe the set of factors
that prevent new firms from entering a market with excess profits. Monopoly can persist only in
the presence of entry barriers.
Economies of Scale
In Chapter 9, we described production technologies in which average
costs fall with output increases. In situations in which those scale economies are very large
relative to the overall market, the cost advantages associated with size can give rise to
monopoly power.
Scale economies come in a number of different forms. Providing cable service requires laying
expensive cable; conventional telephones require the installation of poles and wires. For these
cases, there are clear cost advantages in having only one set of physical apparatuses. Once a firm
has laid the wire, providing service to one more customer is very inexpensive. The semiconductor
industry is another case in which production favors the large firms. In 2007, Intel, the world leader
in production of semiconductors for the PC, estimated that it would spend $6.2 billion for new
production facilities and another $6 billion to support its research efforts to improve the speed of
its chips. For Intel, physical production and the importance of research favor the large firm.
In some cases, scale economies come from marketing and advertising. Breakfast cereal can be
produced efficiently on a small scale, for example; large-scale production does not reduce costs.
However, to compete, a new firm would need an advertising campaign costing millions of dollars.
The large front-end investment requirement in advertising is risky and likely to deter would-be
entrants to the cereal market.
When scale economies are so large relative to the size of the market that costs are minimized
with only one firm in the industry, we have a natural monopoly.
Although Figure 13.7 presents an exaggerated picture, it does serve to illustrate our point.
One large-scale plant (Scale 2) can produce 500,000 units of output at an average unit cost of $1.
If the industry were restructured into five firms, each producing on a smaller scale (Scale 1), the
industry could produce the same amount, but average unit cost would be five times as high ($5).
Consumers potentially see a considerable gain when economies of scale are realized. The critical
point here is that for a natural monopoly to exist, economies of scale must be realized at a scale
that is close to total demand in the market.

CHAPTER 13
Monopoly and Antitrust Policy 279
Notice in Figure 13.7 that the long-run average cost curve continues to decline until it almost
hits the market demand curve. If at a price of $1 market demand is 5 million units of output,
there would be no reason to have only one firm in the industry. Ten firms could each produce
500,000 units, and each could reap the full benefits of the available economies of scale.
Historically, natural monopolies in the United States have been regulated by the state. Public
utility commissions in each state monitor electric companies and locally operating telephone
companies, regulating prices so that the benefits of scale economies are realized without the inef-
ficiencies of monopoly power. The Economics in Practice on p. 280 describes the current debate
over the regulation of cable television.
Patents
Patents are legal barriers that prevent entry into an industry by granting exclusive
use of the patented product or process to the inventor. Patents are issued in the United States
under the authority of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to
“promote the progress of science and the useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and
inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.” Patent protection in the
United States is currently granted for a period of 20 years.
Patents provide an incentive for invention and innovation. New products and new processes
are developed through research undertaken by individual inventors and by firms. Research
requires resources and time, which have opportunity costs. Without the protection that a patent
provides, the results of research would become available to the general public quickly. If research
did not lead to expanded profits, less research would be done. On the negative side though,
patents do serve as a barrier to competition and they slow down the benefits of research flowing
through the market to consumers.
The expiration of patents after a given number of years represents an attempt to balance the
benefits of firms and the benefits of households: On the one hand, it is important to stimulate
invention and innovation; on the other hand, invention and innovation do society less good
when their benefits to the public are constrained.4
In recent years,public attention has been focused on the high costs of health care.One factor con-
tributing to these costs is the high price of many prescription drugs. Equipped with newly developed
tools of bioengineering, the pharmaceutical industry has been granted thousands of patents for new
drugs. When a new drug for treating a disease is developed, the patent holder can charge a high price
for the drug. The drug companies argue that these rewards are justified by high research and develop-
ment costs; others say that these profits are the result of a monopoly protected by the patent system.
Government Rules
Patents provide one example of a government-enforced regulation
that creates monopoly. For patents, the justification for such intervention is to promote innova-
tion. In some cases, governments impose entry restrictions on firms as a way of controlling activ-
ity. In most parts of the United States, governments restrict the sale of alcohol. In fact, in some
states (Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire, and Ohio), liquor can be sold only through state-controlled
and managed stores. Most states operate lotteries as monopolists. However, when large
economies of scale do not exist in an industry or when equity is not a concern, the arguments in
favor of government-run monopolies are much weaker. One argument is that the state wants to
prevent private parties from encouraging and profiting from “sin,” particularly in cases in which
society at large can be harmed. Another argument is that government monopolies are a conve-
nient source of revenues.
Ownership of a Scarce Factor of Production
You cannot enter the diamond-
producing business unless you own a diamond mine. There are not many diamond mines in the
world, and most are already owned by a single firm, the DeBeers Company of South Africa. At
one time, the Aluminum Company of America (now Alcoa) owned or controlled virtually
100 percent of the known bauxite deposits in the world and until the 1940s monopolized the pro-
duction and distribution of aluminum. Obviously, if production requires a particular input and
one firm owns the entire supply of that input, that firm will control the industry. Ownership
alone is a barrier to entry.
4 Another alternative is licensing. With licensing, the new technology is used by all producers and the inventor splits the benefits with
consumers. Because forcing the non-patent-holding producers to use an inefficient technology results in waste, some analysts have
proposed adding mandatory licensing to the current patent system. A key question here involves determining the right licensing fee.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Managing the Cable Monopoly
Many people subscribe to cable television. Cable systems bundle a col-
lection of network and cable stations and offer them to viewers as
packages, ranging from a basic service with only a modest number of
offerings to much-expanded premium services. In the last 20 years,
the cable system has grown to a multibillion dollar industry covering
most of the country.
What you might not realize about the cable system is that it con-
sists of a network of local monopolies. In any given area, typically
just one cable company is in operation. Historically, this monopoly
was justified as a natural monopoly, reflecting the expensive cable
that needed to be laid to serve the population and the fact that once
the cable was laid, the costs of providing service to a new consumer
was modest.
What you also may not realize is that when you pay your cable
bill, part of your payment goes to your home city. In fact, cities nego-
tiate with the various cable companies to give one of them the right
to be the monopoly supplier of cable service in return for a fee that is
typically on the order of 5 percent of the cable revenues. Once a firm
has bought the right to be a local cable company, it must follow a set
of rules, particularly with regard to the availability and price of the
basic cable.
One of the hot debates in 2008 was in the cable industry. Cable
companies offer programs bundled rather than à la carte programs.
Keith Martin, the commissioner of the Federal Communications
Commission, which oversees cable, pushed to have cable unbun-
dled, largely in response to parents who were concerned about
inappropriate television shows coming into their homes as part of a
bundle. What economic logic would justify bundling programs in
this way?
Here it is helpful to think about costs again. Once a television
show is produced, distributing it to another customer has a zero
marginal cost up to the capacity level of the cable. Thus, from a
cable company’s point of view, having a large customer base for
the various shows is typically a profitable strategy. Suppose
100 viewers valued doctor shows at $2 a week each and lawyer
shows at $1.50 each, while another 100 viewers had the opposite
preference. To maximize revenue with à la carte pricing, the cable
company would charge $1.50 for each show, giving it 200 viewers
per show for a revenue of $600 (200 viewers  2 shows each 
 $1.50). If the cable company sells the bundle for $3.50, all view-
ers buy and it earns $700. If the cable company sells the bundle for
$3, its revenue is still the original $600 but now all of its customers
are better off and can watch two programs instead of one. When
the cost of distributing a good with high fixed costs is zero,
bundling is often a way to make both producers and consumers
better off.

network externalities
The value of a product to a
consumer increases with the
number of that product being
sold or used in the market.
Network Effects
How much value do you get from a telephone or a fax machine? It
will depend on how many other people own a machine that can communicate with yours.
Products such as these, in which benefits of ownership are a function of how many other
people are part of the network, are subject to network externalities. For phones and faxes,
the network effects are direct. For products such as the Windows operating system and the
Xbox, network effects may be indirect. Having a large consumer base increases consumer
valuation by encouraging the development of complementary goods. When many people
own an Xbox, game developers have an incentive to create games for the system. Good games
increase the value of the system. In the case of online interactive games like Zygna’s
Farmville, some observers have argued that the size of the playing community creates large
network effects.
How does the existence of network effects create a barrier to entry? In this situation, a firm
that starts early and builds a large product base will have an advantage over a newcomer.
Microsoft’s dominant position in the operating system market reflects network effects in this
business. The high concentration in the game console market (Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony
control this market) also comes from network effects.

CHAPTER 13
Monopoly and Antitrust Policy 281
The Social Costs of Monopoly
So far, we have seen that a monopoly produces less output and charges a higher price than a com-
petitively organized industry if no large economies of scale exist for the monopoly. We have also
seen the way in which barriers to entry can allow monopolists to persist over time. You are prob-
ably thinking at this point that producing less and charging more to earn positive profits is not
likely to be in the best interests of consumers, and you are right.
Inefficiency and Consumer Loss
In Chapter 12, we argued that price must equal marginal cost (P = MC) for markets to produce
what people want. This argument rests on two propositions: (1) that price provides a good
approximation of the social value of a unit of output and (2) that marginal cost, in the absence of
externalities (costs or benefits to external parties not weighed by firms), provides a good approx-
imation of the product’s social opportunity cost. In a pure monopoly, price is above the product
marginal cost. When this happens, the firm is underproducing from society’s point of view.
Society would be better off if the firm produced more and charged a lower price. Monopoly leads
to an inefficient mix of output.
A slightly simplified version of the monopoly diagram appears in Figure 13.8, which shows
how we might make a rough estimate of the size of the loss to social welfare that arises from
monopoly. (For clarity, we will ignore the short-run cost curves and assume constant returns to
scale in the long run.) Under competitive conditions, firms would produce output up to Qc =
4,000 units and price would ultimately settle at Pc = $2, equal to long-run average cost. Any price
above $2 will mean positive profits, which would be eliminated by the entry of new competing
firms in the long run. (You should remember all this from Chapter 9.)
A monopoly firm in the same industry, however, would produce only Qm = 2,000 units per
period and charge a price of Pm = $4 because MR = MC at Qm = 2,000 units. The monopoly
would make a profit equal to total revenue minus total cost, or Pm  Qm minus ATC  Qm. Profit

 FIGURE 13.8 Welfare Loss from Monopoly
A demand curve shows the amounts that people are willing to pay at each potential level of output.
Thus, the demand curve can be used to approximate the benefits to the consumer of raising output
above 2,000 units. MC reflects the marginal cost of the resources needed. The triangle ABC roughly
measures the net social gain of moving from 2,000 units to 4,000 units (or the loss that results when
monopoly decreases output from 4,000 units to 2,000 units).

282
PART  III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
to the monopoly is thus equal to the area PmACPc, or $4,000. [($4  2,000) - ($2  2,000) =
$8,000 - $4,000 = $4,000. Remember that Pc = ATC in this example.]
Now consider the gains and losses associated with increasing price from $2 to $4 and cutting
output from 4,000 units to 2,000 units. As you might guess, the winner will be the monopolist
and the loser will be the consumer, but let us see how it works out.
At Pc = $2, the price under perfect competition, there are no profits. Consumers are paying a
price of $2, but the demand curve shows that many are willing to pay more than that. For exam-
ple, a substantial number of people would pay $4 or more. Those people willing to pay more than
$2 are receiving what we earlier called a consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is the difference
between what households are willing to pay for a product and the current market price. The
demand curve shows approximately how much households are willing to pay at each level of out-
put. Thus, the area of triangle DBPc gives us a rough measure of the “consumer surplus” being
enjoyed by households when the price is $2. Consumers willing to pay exactly $4 get a surplus
equal to $2. Those who place the highest value on this good—that is, those who are willing to pay
the most ($6)—get a surplus equal to DPc, or $4.
Now the industry is reorganized as a monopoly that cuts output to 2,000 units and raises price
to $4. The big winner is the monopolist, who ends up earning profits equal to $4,000. The big losers
are the consumers. Their“surplus”now shrinks from the area of triangle DBPc to the area of triangle
DAPm. Part of that loss (which is equal to DBPc – DAPm, or the area PmABPc) is covered by the
monopolist’s gain of PmACPc, but not all of it. The loss to consumers exceeds the gain to the monop-
oly by the area of triangle ABC (PmABPc – PmACPc), which roughly measures the net loss in social
welfare associated with monopoly power in this industry.Because the area of a triangle is half its base
times its height,the welfare loss is 1/2  2,000  $2 = $2,000.If we could push price back down to the
competitive level and increase output to 4,000 units, consumers would gain more than the monopo-
list would lose and the gain in social welfare would approximate the area of ABC, or $2,000.
In this example, the presence of a monopoly also causes an important change in the distrib-
ution of real income. In Figure 13.8, area PmACPc is a profit of $4,000 flowing every period to the
monopolist. If price were pushed down to $2 by competition or regulation, those profits would
pass to consumers in the form of lower prices. Society may value this resource transfer on equity
grounds in addition to efficiency grounds.
Of course, monopolies may have social costs that do not show up on these graphs.
Monopolies, which are protected from competition by barriers to entry, may not face the
same pressures to cut costs and innovate as competitive firms do. A competitive firm that
does not use the most efficient technology will be driven out of business by firms that do.
One of the significant arguments against tariffs and quotas to protect such industries as auto-
mobiles and steel from foreign competition is that protection lessens the incentive to be effi-
cient and competitive.
Rent-Seeking Behavior
Economists have another concern about monopolies. Triangle ABC in Figure 13.8 represents a
real net loss to society, but part of rectangle PmACPc (the $4,000 monopoly profit) may also end
up lost. To understand why, we need to think about the incentives facing potential monopolists.
The area of rectangle PmACPc shows positive profits. If entry into the market were easy and
competition were open, these profits would eventually be competed to zero. Owners of businesses
earning profits have an incentive to prevent this development. In fact, the graph shows how much
they would be willing to pay to prevent it. A rational owner of a monopoly firm would be willing
to pay any amount less than the entire rectangle. Any portion of profits left over after expenses is
better than zero, which would be the case if free competition eliminated all profits.
Potential monopolists can do many things to protect their profits. One obvious approach is to
push the government to impose restrictions on competition. A classic example is the behavior of
taxicab driver organizations in New York and other large cities. To operate a cab legally in New York
City, you need a license. The city tightly controls the number of licenses available. If entry into the
taxi business were open, competition would hold down cab fares to the cost of operating cabs.
However,cab drivers have become a powerful lobbying force and have muscled the city into restrict-
ing the number of licenses issued. This restriction keeps fares high and preserves monopoly profits.

CHAPTER 13
Monopoly and Antitrust Policy 283
There are countless other examples. The steel industry and the automobile industry spend
large sums lobbying Congress for tariff protection.5 Some experts claim that establishment of
the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board in 1937 to control competition in the airline industry
and extensive regulation of trucking by the I.C.C. prior to deregulation in the 1970s came about
partly through industry efforts to restrict competition and preserve profits.
This kind of behavior, in which households or firms take action to preserve positive profits,
is called rent-seeking behavior. Recall from Chapter 10 that rent is the return to a factor of pro-
duction in strictly limited supply. Rent-seeking behavior has two important implications.
First, this behavior consumes resources. Lobbying and building barriers to entry are not
costless activities. Lobbyists’ wages, expenses of the regulatory bureaucracy, and the like must be
paid. Periodically faced with the prospect that the city of New York will issue new taxi licenses,
cab owners and drivers have become so well organized that they can bring the city to a standstill
with a strike or even a limited job action. Indeed, positive profits may be completely consumed
through rent-seeking behavior that produces nothing of social value; all it does is help to preserve
the current distribution of income.
Second, the frequency of rent-seeking behavior leads us to another view of government. So
far, we have considered only the role that government might play in helping to achieve an effi-
cient allocation of resources in the face of market failure—in this case, failures that arise from
imperfect market structure. Later in this chapter we survey the measures government might take
to ensure that resources are efficiently allocated when monopoly power arises. However, the idea
of rent-seeking behavior introduces the notion of government failure, in which the govern-
ment becomes the tool of the rent seeker and the allocation of resources is made even less effi-
cient than before.
This idea of government failure is at the center of public choice theory, which holds that
governments are made up of people, just as business firms are. These people—politicians and
bureaucrats—can be expected to act in their own self-interest, just as owners of firms do. We turn
to the economics of public choice in Chapter 16.
Price Discrimination
So far in our discussion of monopoly, we have assumed that the firm faces a known downward-
sloping demand curve and must choose a single price and a single quantity of output. Indeed, the
reason that price and marginal revenue are different for a monopoly and the same for a perfectly
competitive firm is that if a monopoly decides to sell more output, it must lower price in order
to do so.
In the real world, however, there are many examples of firms that charge different prices to dif-
ferent groups of buyers. Charging different prices to different buyers is called price discrimination.
The motivation for price discrimination is fairly obvious: If a firm can identify those who are will-
ing to pay a higher price for a good, it can earn more profit from them by charging a higher price.
The idea is best illustrated using the extreme case where a firm knows what each buyer is willing to
pay. A firm that charges the maximum amount that buyers are willing to pay for each unit is prac-
ticing perfect price discrimination.
Figure 13.9 is similar to Figure 13.8. For simplicity, assume a firm with a constant marginal
cost equal to $2 per unit. A non-price-discriminating monopolist would have to set one and only
one price. That firm would face the marginal revenue curve shown in the diagram and would
produce as long as MR is above MC: Output would be Qm, and price would be set at $4 per unit.
The firm would earn an economic profit of $2 per unit for every unit up to Qm. Consumers
would enjoy a consumer surplus equal to the shaded area. Consumer A, for example, is willing to
pay $5.75 but has to pay only $4.00.
Now consider what would happen if the firm could charge each consumer the maximum
amount that that consumer was willing to pay. In Figure 13.9(a), if the firm could charge con-
sumer A a price of $5.75, the firm would earn $3.75 in profit on that unit and the consumer
would get no consumer surplus. Going on to consumer B, if the firm could determine B’s

maximum willingness to pay and charge $5.50, profit would be $3.50 and consumer surplus for B
would again be zero. This would continue all the way to point C on the demand curve, where total
profit would be equal to the entire area under the demand curve and above the MC = ATC line, as
shown in Figure 13.9(b).
Another way to look at the diagram in Figure 13.9(b) is to notice that the demand curve
actually becomes the same as the marginal revenue curve. When a firm can charge the maximum
that anyone is willing to pay for each unit, that price is marginal revenue. There is no need to draw
a separate MR curve as there was when the firm could charge only one price to all consumers.
Once again, profit is the entire shaded area and consumer surplus is zero.
It is interesting to note that a perfectly price-discriminating monopolist will actually pro-
duce the efficient quantity of output—Qc in Figure 13.9(b), which is the same as the amount that
would be produced had the industry been perfectly competitive. The firm will continue to pro-
duce as long as benefits to consumers exceed marginal cost; it does not stop at Qm in
Figure 13.9(a). But when a monopolist can perfectly price discriminate, it reaps all the net
benefits from higher production. There is no deadweight loss, but there is no consumer
surplus either.

CHAPTER 13
Monopoly and Antitrust Policy 285
Examples of Price Discrimination
Examples of price discrimination are all around us. It used to be that airlines routinely charged
those who stayed over Saturday nights a much lower fare than those who did not. Business trav-
elers generally travel during the week, often are unwilling to stay over Saturdays, and generally are
willing to pay more for tickets.
Airlines, movie theaters, hotels, and many other industries routinely charge a lower price for
children and the elderly. The reason is that children and the elderly generally have a lower willing-
ness to pay. Telephone companies have so many ways of targeting different groups that it is diffi-
cult to know what they are really charging.
In each case, the objective of the firm is to segment the market into different identifiable
groups, with each group having a different elasticity of demand. Doing so requires firms to ensure
that different customers are kept separated, so that they cannot trade with one another. It can be
shown, although we will not present the analysis here, that the optimal strategy for a firm that can
sell in more than one market is to charge higher prices in markets with low demand elasticities.
Remedies for Monopoly: Antitrust Policy
As we have just seen, the exercise of monopoly power can bring with it considerable social costs.
On the other hand, as our discussion of entry barriers suggested, at times, monopolies may bring
with them benefits associated with scale economies or innovation gains. Sometimes monopolies
result from the natural interplay of market and technological forces, while at other times firms
actively and aggressively pursue monopoly power, doing their best to eliminate the competition.
In the United States, the rules set out in terms of what firms can and cannot do in their markets
are contained in two pieces of antitrust legislation: the Sherman Act passed in 1890 and the
Clayton Act passed in 1914.
Major Antitrust Legislation
The following are some of the major antitrust legislation that have been passed in the United States.
The Sherman Act of 1890
The substance of the Sherman Act is contained in two
short sections:
Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy,
in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is
hereby declared to be illegal....
Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or
conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or com-
merce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a mis-
demeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five
thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punish-
ments, in the discretion of the court.
For our treatment of monopoly, the relevant part of the Sherman Act is Section 2, the rule
against monopolization or attempted monopolization. The language of the act is quite broad, so
it is the responsibility of the courts to judge conduct that is legal and conduct that is illegal. As a
firm competes in the hopes of winning business, what kind of behavior is acceptable hard compe-
tition and what is not? Two different administrative bodies have the responsibility for initiating
actions on behalf of the U.S. government against individuals or companies thought to be in viola-
tion of the antitrust laws. These agencies are the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In addition, private citizens can initiate antitrust actions.
In 1911, two major antitrust cases were decided by the Supreme Court. The two companies
involved, Standard Oil and American Tobacco, seemed to epitomize the textbook definition of
monopoly, and both appeared to exhibit the structure and the conduct outlawed by the Sherman
Act. Standard Oil controlled about 91 percent of the refining industry, and although the exact figure

286
PART  III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
is still disputed,the American Tobacco Trust probably controlled between 75 percent and 90 percent
of the market for all tobacco products except cigars. Both companies had used tough tactics to swal-
low up competition or to drive it out of business. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court found both
firms guilty of violating Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and ordered their dissolution.6
The Court made clear, however, that the Sherman Act did not outlaw every action that
seemed to restrain trade, only those that were “unreasonable.” In enunciating this rule of reason,
the Court seemed to say that structure alone was not a criterion for unreasonableness. Thus, it
was possible for a near-monopoly not to violate the Sherman Act as long as it had won its market
using “reasonable” tactics.
Subsequent court cases confirmed that a firm could be convicted of violating the Sherman Act
only if it had exhibited unreasonable conduct. Between 1911 and 1920, cases were brought against
Eastman Kodak,International Harvester,United Shoe Machinery,and United States Steel.The first
three companies controlled overwhelming shares of their respective markets, and the fourth con-
trolled 60 percent of the country’s capacity to produce steel. Nonetheless, all four cases were dis-
missed on the grounds that these companies had shown no evidence of “unreasonable conduct.”
New technologies have also created challenges for the courts in defining reasonable con-
duct. Perhaps the largest antitrust case recently has been the case launched by the U.S.
Department of Justice against Microsoft. By the 1990s, Microsoft had more that 90 percent of
the market in operating systems for PCs. The government argued that Microsoft had achieved
this market share through illegal dealing, while Microsoft argued that the government failed
to understand the issues associated with competition in a market with network externalities
and dynamic competition. In the end, the case was settled with a consent decree in July 1994. A
consent decree is a formal agreement between a prosecuting government and defendants that
must be approved by the courts. Such decrees can be signed before, during, or after a trial and
are often used to save litigation costs. In the case of Microsoft, under the consent decree, it
agreed to give computer manufacturers more freedom to install software from other software
companies. In 1997, Microsoft found itself charged with violating the terms of the consent
decree and was back in court. In 2000, the company was found guilty of violating the antitrust
laws and a judge ordered it split into two companies. But Microsoft appealed; and the decision
to split the company was replaced with a consent decree requiring Microsoft to behave more
competitively, including a provision that computer makers would have the ability to sell com-
petitors’ software without fear of retaliation. In the fall of 2005, Microsoft finally ended its
antitrust troubles in the United States after agreeing to pay RealNetworks $761 million to set-
tle one final lawsuit.
In 2005, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) brought suit against Intel, which has an 80 per-
cent share of the x-86 processors used in most of the world’s PCs. AMD alleged anticompeti-
tive behavior and attempted monopolization. At present in the United States, private
antitrust cases, brought by one firm against another, are 20-plus times more common than
government-led cases.
The Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission, 1914
Designed to
strengthen the Sherman Act and to clarify the rule of reason, the Clayton Act of 1914 outlawed
a number of specific practices. First, it made tying contracts illegal. Such contracts force a cus-
tomer to buy one product to obtain another. Second, it limited mergers that would “substan-
tially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.” Third, it banned price
discrimination—charging different customers different prices for reasons other than changes in
cost or matching competitors’ prices.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), created by Congress in 1914, was established to
investigate “the organization, business conduct, practices, and management” of companies that
engage in interstate commerce. At the same time, the act establishing the commission added
another vaguely worded prohibition to the books: “Unfair methods of competition in commerce
are hereby declared unlawful.” The determination of what constituted “unfair” behavior was left
up to the commission. The FTC was also given the power to issue “cease-and-desist orders”where
it found behavior in violation of the law.

Court in 1911 to determine

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Antitrust Rules Cover the NFL
Most people recognize that a sports league like the National Football
League is big business, but not everyone realizes that it is subject to
antitrust laws. But, as the article below indicates, one of the biggest
cases facing the Supreme Court in 2009–2010 involved the NFL.
The NFL’s practice had been to negotiate as a single unit with
apparel companies that wished to sell apparel like hats and T-shirts
with football logos. Of course this meant that apparel companies
could not play the New York Giants against the Indianapolis Colts in
signing deals. American Needle, a large apparel company, sued. In its
defense, the NFL argued that in its negotiations with companies like
Reebok and American Needle, it faced competition from baseball and
basketball leagues that kept it from extracting too high a price for its
logos. In essence, the NFL argued that in the sports-logo hat market a
New York Yankees hat was a pretty good substitute for a New York
Giants hat. The court saw it differently.
American Needle: High Court Delivers 9–0
Shutout Against NFL
The Wall Street Journal
Wow. Turns out the big antitrust case of the 2009–2010
Supreme Court term, American Needle v. NFL, didn’t provide
much of a matchup.
American Needle clobbered the league, in a unanimous
9-0 decision penned by Justice John Paul Stevens. We had
no dissents and no concurrences. This was an unadulterated
blowout. This was the 1940 NFL Championship game; the
1986 Super Bowl.
The case pitted American Needle, Inc., an apparel manu-
facturer, against the NFL. The dispute started back in 2000
when the NFL signed an exclusive apparel licensing deal with
Reebok International, now a unit of Adidas AG.
American Needle, which had individual licensing deals
with NFL teams, sued, arguing the NFL’s exclusive deal
with Reebok violated antitrust rules. The NFL argued that 
it is a single entity with 32 teams that compete with 
each other in football but not in business, where the teams
collectively compete with other sports and forms of enter-
tainment. American Needle countered by arguing that 
the league was actually a collection of 32 independent
entities—i.e., all the teams.
The Seventh Circuit in 2008 ruled for the NFL, prompting
the appeal.
The Supreme Court on Monday essentially ruled that the
NFL is composed of 32 separate business entities.

CHAPTER 13
Monopoly and Antitrust Policy 287
Imperfect Markets: A Review and a 
Look Ahead
A firm has market power when it exercises some control over the price of its output or the prices
of the inputs that it uses. The extreme case of a firm with market power is the pure monopolist.
In a pure monopoly, a single firm produces a product for which there are no close substitutes in
an industry in which all new competitors are barred from entry.
Our focus in this chapter on pure monopoly (which occurs rarely) has served a number
of purposes. First, the monopoly model describes a number of industries quite well. Second,
the monopoly case illustrates the observation that imperfect competition leads to an
inefficient allocation of resources. Finally, the analysis of pure monopoly offers insights 
into the more commonly encountered market models of monopolistic competition and
oligopoly, which we discussed briefly in this chapter and will discuss in detail in the next 
two chapters.
Nonetheless, the legislation of 1914 retained the focus on conduct; thus, the rule of reason
remained central to all antitrust action in the courts.

288
PART  III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
S U M M A R Y
1. A number of assumptions underlie the logic of perfect com-
petition. Among them: (1) A large number of firms and
households are interacting in each market; (2) firms in a
given market produce undifferentiated, or homogeneous,
products; and (3) new firms are free to enter industries and
compete for profits. The first two imply that firms have no
control over input prices or output prices; the third implies
that opportunities for positive profit are eliminated in the
long run.
IMPERFECT COMPETITION AND MARKET POWER:
CORE CONCEPTS p. 269
2. A market in which individual firms have some control over
price is imperfectly competitive. Such firms exercise market
power. The three forms of imperfect competition are monop-
oly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition.
3. A pure monopoly is an industry with a single firm that pro-
duces a product for which there are no close substitutes and
in which there are significant barriers to entry.
4. Market power means that firms must make four decisions
instead of three: (1) how much to produce, (2) how to pro-
duce it, (3) how much to demand in each input market, and
(4) what price to charge for their output.
5. Market power does not imply that a monopolist can charge
any price it wants. Monopolies are constrained by market
demand. They can sell only what people will buy and only at
a price that people are willing to pay.
PRICE AND OUTPUT DECISIONS IN PURE
MONOPOLY MARKETS p. 271
6. In perfect competition, many firms supply homogeneous
products. With only one firm in a monopoly market, how-
ever, there is no distinction between the firm and the
industry—the firm is the industry. The market demand
curve is thus the firm’s demand curve, and the total quantity
supplied in the market is what the monopoly firm decides to
produce.
7. For a monopolist, an increase in output involves not just
producing more and selling it but also reducing the price of
its output to sell it. Thus, marginal revenue, to a monopolist,
is not equal to product price, as it is in competition. Instead,
marginal revenue is lower than price because to raise output
1 unit and to be able to sell that 1 unit, the firm must lower
the price it charges to all buyers.
8. A profit-maximizing monopolist will produce up to the
point at which marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost
(MR = MC).
9. Monopolies have no identifiable supply curves. They simply
choose a point on the market demand curve. That is, they
choose a price and quantity to produce, which depend on
both the marginal cost and the shape of the demand curve.
10. In the short run, monopolists are limited by a fixed factor of
production, just as competitive firms are. Monopolies that
do not generate enough revenue to cover costs will go out of
business in the long run.
11. Compared with a competitively organized industry, a monop-
olist restricts output, charges higher prices, and earns positive
profits. Because MR always lies below the demand curve for a
monopoly, monopolists always charge a price higher than MC
(the price that would be set by perfect competition).
12. Barriers to entry prevent new entrants from competing away
industry excess profits.
13. Forms of barriers to entry include economies of scale,
patents, government rules, ownership of scarce factors, and
network effects.
14. When a firm exhibits economies of scale so large that aver-
age costs continuously decline with output, it may be effi-
cient to have only one firm in an industry. Such an industry
is called a natural monopoly.
THE SOCIAL COSTS OF MONOPOLY p. 281
15. When firms price above marginal cost, the result is an ineffi-
cient mix of output. The decrease in consumer surplus is
larger than the monopolist’s profit, thus causing a net loss in
social welfare.
16. Actions that firms take to preserve positive profits, such as
lobbying for restrictions on competition, are called rent
seeking. Rent-seeking behavior consumes resources and adds
to social cost, thus reducing social welfare even further.
PRICE DISCRIMINATION p. 283
17. Charging different prices to different buyers is called price
discrimination. The motivation for price discrimination is
fairly obvious: If a firm can identify those who are willing to
pay a higher price for a good, it can earn more profit from
them by charging a higher price.
18. A firm that charges the maximum amount that buyers are
willing to pay for each unit is practicing perfect price
discrimination.
19. A perfectly price-discriminating monopolist will actually
produce the efficient quantity of output.
20. Examples of price discrimination are all around us. Airlines
routinely charge travelers who stay over Saturday nights a
much lower fare than those who do not. Business travelers gen-
erally travel during the week, often are unwilling to stay over
Saturdays, and generally are willing to pay more for tickets.
REMEDIES FOR MONOPOLY: ANTITRUST POLICY p. 285
21. Governments have assumed two roles with respect to imper-
fectly competitive industries: (1) They promote competition
and restrict market power, primarily through antitrust laws
and other congressional acts; and (2) they restrict competi-
tion by regulating industries.
22. In 1914, Congress passed the Clayton Act, which was
designed to strengthen the Sherman Act and to clarify what
specific forms of conduct were “unreasonable” restraints of
trade. In the same year, the Federal Trade Commission was
established and given broad power to investigate and regu-
late unfair methods of competition.

1. Do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements?
Explain your reasoning.
a. For a monopoly, price is equal to marginal revenue because a
monopoly has the power to control price.
b. Because a monopoly is the only firm in an industry, it can
charge virtually any price for its product.
c. It is always true that when demand elasticity is equal to -1,
marginal revenue is equal to 0.
2. Explain why the marginal revenue curve facing a competitive
firm differs from the marginal revenue curve facing a monopolist.

Wonks hired a management consulting firm, which estimated

12. Black Eyed Peas was a rock band that stood at the top of the
charts for sales in 2010 when its song “I Gotta Feeling” was
downloaded over 7 million times. The path to success for a rock
band involves reducing the elasticity of demand that it faces and
building barriers to entry. That sounds like economic babble,
but it has a lot of meaning. Using the language of economics
and the concepts presented in this chapter, explain why lowering
the elasticity of demand and building barriers to entry are
exactly what Black Eyed Peas is trying to do.
13. The diagram below shows a firm (industry) that earns a normal
return to capital if organized competitively. Price in the market
place is Pc under competition. We assume at first that marginal
cost is fixed at $50 per unit of output and that there are no
economies or diseconomies of scale. [The equation of the
demand curve facing the industry is P = 100 – 1/180 Q].
Calculate the total revenue to the competitive firms, assum-
ing free entry. What is total cost under competition? Calculate
consumer surplus under competition.
Now assume that you bought all the firms in this industry,
combining them into a single-firm monopoly protected from
entry by a patent. Calculate the profit-maximizing price, Pm,
total revenue from the monopoly, total cost, profit, and con-
sumer surplus. Also compare the competitive and monopoly
outcomes. Calculate the dead weight loss from monopoly. What

A Proper Role?
We have now examined two
“pure” market structures. At one
extreme is perfect competition, a
market structure in which many
firms, each small relative to the
size of the market, produce undif-
ferentiated products and have no
market power at all. Each com-
petitive firm takes price as given
and faces a perfectly elastic
demand for its product. At the
other extreme is pure monopoly, a
market structure in which only
one firm is the industry. The
monopoly holds the power to set price and is protected against competition by barriers to
entry. Its market power would be complete if it did not face the discipline of the market
demand curve. Even a monopoly, however, must produce a product that people want and are
willing to pay for.
Most industries in the United States fall somewhere between these two extremes. In the next
two chapters, we focus on two types of industries in which firms exercise some market power but
at the same time face competition: oligopoly and monopolistic competition. In this chapter, we
cover oligopolies, and in Chapter 15, we turn to monopolistic competition.
An oligopoly is an industry dominated by a few firms that, by virtue of their individual sizes,
are large enough to influence the market price. Oligopolies exist in many forms. Consider the fol-
lowing cases:
In the United States, 90 percent of the music produced and sold comes from one of four stu-
dios: Universal, Sony, Warner, or EMI. The competition among these four firms is intense, but
most of it involves the search for new talent and the marketing of that talent. Although studios
compete less on price, Radiohead’s 2007 campaign to have consumers set their own price in buy-
ing its new CD may result in a shake-up of the industry.
Stents are small metal devices used to prop open coronary arteries once they have been
unblocked by angioplasty surgery. In the United States, the $1 billion stent market is domi-
nated by three firms: Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic. Among the three,
there is fierce competition in the area of research and development (R&D) as they try to
develop new, improved products. In 2007, Johnson & Johnson tried marketing its stents
directly to patients, with an advertisement during the Dallas Cowboys–New York Jets
Thanksgiving Day football game. On the other hand, we see very little price competition
among these firms.
Airlines are another oligopolistic industry, but price competition can be fierce. When
Southwest enters a new market, travelers often benefit from large price drops.
In 2010 Amazon found its position in the market for handheld readers threatened as the
Kindle was joined by both the Nook and the iPad.
What we see in these examples is the complexity of competition among oligopolists.
Oligopolists compete with one another not only in price but also in developing new products,
marketing and advertising those products, and developing complements to use with the products.

Competition
At times, in some industries, competition in any of these areas can be fierce; in the other industries,
there seems to be more of a “live and let live” attitude. The complex interdependence among oli-
gopolists combined with the wide range of strategies that they use to compete makes them difficult
to analyze. To find the right strategy, firms need to anticipate the reactions of their customers and
their rivals to what the firms do. If I raise my price, will my rivals follow me? If they do not, will my
customers leave, or are they attracted enough to what I produce that they will continue to purchase
from me? If Universal decides to dramatically cut prices of its music and redo its contracts with
artists so that they earn more revenue from concerts, will Sony imitate that strategy? If Sony does,
how will that affect Universal? As you can see, these are hard, although interesting, questions. This
chapter will introduce you to a range of different models from the fields of game theory and com-
petitive strategy to help you answer these questions.
The four cases just described differ not only in how firms compete but also in some of the
fundamental features of their industries. Before we describe the formal models of the way oligop-
oly firms interact, it is useful to provide a few tools that can be used to analyze the structure of the
industries to which those firms belong. Knowing more of the structure of an industry can help us
figure out which of the models we describe will be most helpful. For this exercise, we will rely on
some of the tools developed in the area of competitive strategy used in business schools and in
management consulting.
Market Structure in an Oligopoly
One of the standard models used in the competitive strategy area to look at the structure of an
oligopoly industry is the Five Forces model developed by Michael Porter of Harvard University.
Figure 14.1 illustrates the model.
The five forces help us explain the relative profitability of an industry and identify in which
area firm rivalry is likely to be most intense.
The center box of the figure focuses on the competition among the existing firms in the
industry. In the competitive market, that box is so full of competitors that no individual firm
needs to think strategically about any other individual firm. In the case of monopoly, the center
box has only one firm. In an oligopoly, there are a small number of firms and each of those firms
will spend time thinking about how it can best compete against the other firms.
What characteristics of the existing firms should we look at to see how that competition will
unfold? An obvious structural feature of an industry to consider is the number and size distribution
of those firms. Do the top two firms have 90 percent of the market or only 20 percent? Is there one
very large firm and a few smaller competitors, or are firms similar in size? Table 14.1 shows the dis-
tribution of market shares in a range of different U.S. industries, based on census data using value of
shipments. Market share can also be constructed using employment data. We can see that even
within industries that are highly concentrated, there are differences. Ninety percent of U.S. beer is
made by the top four firms (Anheuser-Busch itself produces 50 percent of the beer sold in the

United States), but there is a relatively large fringe of much smaller firms. In the copper industry, we
find only large firms.As we will see shortly in the models, with fewer firms, all else being equal com-
petition is reduced.
We are also interested in the size distribution of firms among the top firms. Again, looking at
the beer industry, while Anheuser-Busch produces half of the U.S. beer consumed, MillerCoors (a
recently merged pair) is now up to 30 percent of the market, giving us a two-firm concentration
ratio of 80 percent. In the market for conventional DVD players, Sony controls 20 percent of the
market, but the next three or four firms in the industry have similar shares. When we discuss the
price leadership model of oligopoly, we will highlight this question of size distribution. In our
discussion of government merger policy, we will discuss measures other than the concentration
ratio that can be used to measure firm shares.
The final feature of existing firms that we want to look at is the amount of product differenti-
ation we see in the industry. Are the firms all making the same product, or are the products very
different from one another? This takes us back to the issue of how close products are as substitutes,
a topic introduced in Chapter 13 in the description of monopoly. How different are Actavision’s
Guitar Hero and Electronic Arts’ Rock Band? Does Farmville compete, or are there really different
markets for casual and dedicated gamers as some claim? The more differentiated products made by
oligopolists are, the more their behavior will resemble that of the monopolist.
Now look at the boxes to the north and south of the competitive rivalry box in Figure 14.1.
To the north, we see potential entrants. In the last chapter, we described the major sources of
entry barriers. When entry barriers are low, new firms can come in to compete away any excess
profits that existing firms are earning. In an oligopoly, we find that the threat of entry by new
firms can play an important role in how competition in the industry unfolds. In some cases, the
threat alone may be enough to make an industry with only a few firms behave like a perfectly
competitive firm. Markets in which entry and exit are easy so that the threat of potential entry
holds down prices to a competitive level are known as contestable markets.
Consider, for example, a small airline that can move its capital stock from one market to
another with little cost. Cape Air flies between Boston, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape
Cod during the summer months. During the winter, the same planes are used in Florida, where
they fly up and down that state’s west coast between Naples, Fort Meyers, Tampa, and other cities.
A similar situation may occur when a new industrial complex is built at a fairly remote site and a
number of trucking companies offer their services. Because the trucking companies’ capital stock
is mobile, they can move their trucks somewhere else at no great cost if business is not profitable.
Existing firms in this market are continuously faced with the threat of competition. In con-
testable markets, even large oligopolistic firms end up behaving like perfectly competitive firms.
Prices are pushed to long-run average cost by competition, and positive profits do not persist.
To the south of the competitor box, we see substitutes. For oligopolists—just like the
monopolists described in the last chapter—the availability of substitute products outside the
industry will limit the ability of firms to earn high profits.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Why Are Record Labels Losing Key Stars Like Madonna?
How can we use the Five Forces model to help us understand the com-
petition record labels face? Notice first that the defectors from the
labels—Madonna, Radiohead, and Nine Inch Nails—are well-known
stars. For the record labels, these stars are suppliers. As these stars gain
in popularity, they can drive harder bargains with the record labels.
(This is one reason record labels sign artists to multiple record con-
tracts, but no contract lasts forever.) While the supply of unknown
singers is likely quite elastic, the supply of branded stars like Madonna
is much more inelastic. Some people would argue that venues such as
YouTube reduce the power of the record labels, even for young artists,
by providing low-cost exposure. Here, YouTube serves as a substitute
for the record labels from the perspective of the unknown artists.
Buyers are also gaining power.With easy access to downloaded music,
often pirated, listeners are willing to spend less on music and concerts
play a bigger role in generating revenue for artists. Most observers
think that the sum of these changes brought by new technology will be
negative for record label profits.
Madonna (and the Internet) Disrupts 
Another Business
Wall Street Journal
Madonna has always had a keen eye for the latest trends
and her new megadeal is no exception. But this time it’s not
due to the latest musical styles she’s embracing. It’s the fact
that the Internet is disrupting traditional business models.
Rather than renewing her contract with her longtime
record label Warner Bros., the Material Girl is signing a 
10-year, $120-million deal with a concert-promotion com-
pany, the Journal reports. The promoter, Live Nation,
probably won’t make that back by selling the three albums
worth of music Madonna’s agreed to record for them.
Instead, it intends to make a profit by selling everything
from concert tickets to Madonna-brand perfumes to cor-
porate sponsorships.
It’s a textbook example of how the Internet is disrupting
an industry. The record labels used to be the key players in the
music industry. Getting music to fans meant negotiating a
complex supply chain that included printing records and deliv-
ering them to stores. Looking at it this way, the record labels
are more or less distribution companies. Yes, it’s a simplified
view, but it also makes it easier to see the broader implications,
because most successful companies have had to master two
skills: making stuff and distributing stuff.
The Internet is the world’s most efficient distribution
channel, which makes it a threat to any business whose
business model relies on getting product to customers. In
the case of the music industry, anyone can now distribute
their music over the Internet for little or no cost. This, in turn,
changes the value of recorded music. Madonna and bands
like Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails realize that the best way
to make money is to use their music as a way to promote
their overall brands. 
The music industry is just the most obvious example of
the way the Internet is changing the way an industry
distributes, values, and indeed defines its product.
Newspapers—including the Business Technology Blog’s
employer—are going through their own version of this dis-
ruption right now. And it’s just a matter of time before it
impacts other industries.

Now take a look at the horizontal boxes in Figure 14.1. One of the themes in this book has
been the way in which input and output markets are linked. Firms that sell in the product market
also buy in the input market. Conditions faced by firms in their input markets are described in
the left-hand box, suppliers. The circular flow diagram in Chapter 3 emphasizes this point.We see
this same point in the Five Forces horizontal boxes. Airlines, which have some market power in
the airline industry, face strong oligopolists when they try to buy or lease airplanes. In the air-
plane market, Boeing and Airbus control almost the entire market for commercial airplanes. In
the market for leasing planes, GE has a dominant position. When a firm with market power faces
another firm with market power in the input markets, interesting bargaining dynamics may
result in terms of who ends up with the profits.
Finally, on the right side of the Five Forces diagram, we see the buyer or consumer—in some
ways the most important part of the schema. Buyer preferences, which we studied as we looked at
individual demand and utility functions—help to determine how successful a firm will be when it

CHAPTER 14
Oligopoly 297
tries to differentiate its products. Some buyers can also exert bargaining power, even when faced
with a relatively powerful seller. When people think of buyers, they usually think of the retail
buyer of consumer goods. These buyers typically have little power. But many products in the U.S.
economy are sold to other firms, and in many of these markets firms face highly concentrated
buyers. Intel sells its processors to the relatively concentrated personal computer market, in which
Dell has a large share. Proctor & Gamble (P&G) sells its consumer products to Wal-Mart, which
currently controls 25 percent of the retail grocery market.Wal-Mart’s power has enormous effects
on how P&G can compete in its markets.
We have now identified a number of the key features of an oligopolistic industry.
Understanding these features will help us predict the strategies firms will use to compete with
their rivals for business. We turn now to some of the models of oligopolistic behavior.
Oligopoly Models
Because many different types of oligopolies exist, a number of different oligopoly models have
been developed. The following provides a sample of the alternative approaches to the behavior
(or conduct) of oligopolistic firms. As you will see, all kinds of oligopolies have one thing in com-
mon: The behavior of any given oligopolistic firm depends on the behavior of the other firms in
the industry composing the oligopoly.
The Collusion Model
In Chapter 13, we examined what happens when a perfectly competitive industry falls under
the control of a single profit-maximizing firm. We saw that when many competing firms act
independently, they produce more, charge a lower price, and earn less profit than if they had
acted as a single unit. If these firms get together and agree to cut production and increase
price—that is, if firms can agree not to price compete—they will have a bigger total-profit
pie to carve up. When a group of profit-maximizing oligopolists colludes on price and out-
put, the result is the same as it would be if a monopolist controlled the entire industry. That
is, the colluding oligopoly will face market demand and produce only up to the point at
which marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal (MR = MC) and price will be set above
marginal cost.
A group of firms that gets together and makes price and output decisions jointly is called a
cartel. Perhaps the most familiar example of a cartel today is the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC). The OPEC cartel consists of 13 countries, including Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait, that agree on oil production levels. As early as 1970, the OPEC cartel began to cut
petroleum production. Its decisions in this matter led to a 400 percent increase in the price of
crude oil on world markets during 1973 and 1974.
OPEC is a cartel of governments. Cartels consisting of firms, by contrast, are illegal under
U.S. antitrust laws described in Chapter 13. Price fixing has been defined by courts as any
agreement among individual competitors concerning prices. All agreements aimed at fixing
prices or output levels, regardless of whether the resulting prices are high, are illegal. Moreover,
price fixing is a criminal offense, and the penalty for being found guilty can involve jail time as
well as fines. In the 1950s, a group of 12 executives from five different companies in the electri-
cal equipment industry were found guilty of a price-fixing scheme to rotate winning bids
among the firms. All were fined and sentenced to jail. In 2005, a former executive from Bayer
AG, a major German pharmaceutical company, was sentenced to four months in jail and given
a $50,000 fine for price fixing. In 2007, the U.S. government launched suits charging price fix-
ing against a number of firms in industries ranging from car rentals to board game manu-
facturers. Despite the clear illegality of price fixing, the lure of profits seems to attract some
executives to agree on prices.
For a cartel to work, a number of conditions must be present. First, demand for the cartel’s
product must be inelastic. If many substitutes are readily available, the cartel’s price increases may
become self-defeating as buyers switch to substitutes. Here we see the importance of understand-
ing the substitutes box in Figure 14.1. Second, the members of the cartel must play by the rules. If

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government
a cartel is holding up prices by restricting output, there is a big incentive for members to cheat by
increasing output. Breaking ranks can mean huge profits.
Incentives of the various members of a cartel to “cheat” on the cartel rather than cooperate
highlights the role of the size distribution of firms in an industry. Consider an industry with one
large firm and a group of small firms that has agreed to charge relatively high prices. For each
firm, the price will be above its marginal cost of production. Gaining market share by selling
more units is thus very appealing. On the other hand, if every firm drops prices to gain a market
share, the cartel will collapse. For small players in an industry, the attraction of the added market
share is often hard to resist, while the top firms in the industry have more to lose if the cartel col-
lapses and have less added  market share to gain. In most cartels, it is the small firms that begin
pricing at below cartel prices.
Collusion occurs when price- and quantity-fixing agreements are explicit, as in a cartel. Tacit
collusion occurs when firms end up fixing prices without a specific agreement or when such
agreements are implicit. A small number of firms with market power may fall into the practice of
setting similar prices or following the lead of one firm without ever meeting or setting down for-
mal agreements. The fewer and more similar the firms, the easier it will be for tacit collusion to
occur. As we will see later in this chapter, antitrust laws also play a role in trying to discourage
tacit collusion.
The Price-Leadership Model
In another form of oligopoly, one firm dominates an industry and all the smaller firms follow
the leader’s pricing policy—hence its name price leadership. If the dominant firm knows that
the smaller firms will follow its lead, it will derive its own demand curve by subtracting from
total market demand the amount of demand that the smaller firms will satisfy at each poten-
tial price.
The price-leadership model is best applied when the industry is made up of one large
firm and a number of smaller competitive firms. Under these conditions, we can think of
the dominant firm as maximizing profit subject to the constraint of market demand and
subject to the behavior of the smaller competitive firms. Smaller firms then can essentially
sell all they want at this market price. The difference between the quantity demanded in the
market and the amount supplied by the smaller firms is the amount that the dominant firm
will produce.
Under price leadership, the quantity demanded in the market will be produced by a mix
of the smaller firms and the dominant firm. Contrast this situation with that of the monopo-
list. For a monopolist, the only constraint it faces comes from consumers, who at some price
will forgo the good the monopolist produces. In an oligopoly, with a dominant firm practic-
ing price leadership, the existence of the smaller firms (and their willingness to produce out-
put) is also a constraint. For this reason, the output expected under price leadership lies
between that of the monopolist and the competitive firm, with prices also set between the
two price levels.
The fact that the smaller firms constrain the behavior of the dominant firm suggests
that that firm might have an incentive to try to push those smaller firms out of the market
by buying up or merging with the smaller firms. We have already seen in the monopoly
chapter how moving from many firms to one firm can help a firm increase profits, even as it
reduces social welfare. Antitrust rules governing mergers, discussed later in this chapter,
reflect the potential social costs of such mergers. An alternative way for a dominant firm to
reduce the number of smaller firms in its industry is through aggressive price setting. Rather
than accommodate the small firms, as is done in the price-leadership situation, the domi-
nant firm can try cutting prices aggressively until the smaller firms leave. The practice by
which a large, powerful firm tries to drive smaller firms out of the market by temporarily
selling at an artificially low price is called predatory pricing. Such behavior can be very
expensive for the larger firm and is often ineffective. Changing prices below average variable
costs to push other firms out of an industry in the expectation of later recouping through
price increases is also illegal under antitrust laws.

The left graph shows a profit-maximizing output of 2,000 units for a monopolist with marginal cost of $2.
The right graph shows output of 1,333.33 units each for two duopolists with the same marginal cost of $2,
facing the same demand curve. Total industry output increases as we go from the monopolist to the Cournot
duopolists, but it does not rise as high as the competitive output (here 4,000 units).
The Cournot Model
A very simple model that illustrates the idea of interdependence among firms in an oligopoly is
the Cournot model, introduced in the 19th century by the mathematician Antoine Augustin
Cournot. The model is based on Cournot’s observations of competition between two producers
of spring water. Despite the age of the model and some if its restrictive assumptions, the intuition
that emerges from it has proven to be helpful to economists and policy makers.
The original Cournot model focused on an oligopoly with only two firms producing identi-
cal products and not colluding. A two-firm oligopoly is known as a duopoly. The key feature of
an oligopoly, compared to the competitive firm, is that a firm’s optimal decisions depend on the
actions of the other individual firms in its industry. In a duopoly, the right output choice for each
of the two firms will depend on what the other firm does. Cournot provides us with one way to
model how firms take each other’s behavior into account.
Return to the monopoly example that we used in the previous chapter in Figure 13.8 on 
p.281,reproduced here as Figure 14.2(a).Marginal cost is constant at $2,and the demand curve fac-
ing the monopolist firm is the downward-sloping market demand curve. Recall that the marginal
revenue curve lies below the demand curve because in order to increase sales the monopoly firm
must lower its per-unit price. In this example, the marginal revenue curve hits zero at an output of
3,000 units. In this market, the monopolist maximizes profits at a quantity of 2,000 units and a
price of $4 as we saw in the last chapter. What happens in this market if, instead of having one
monopoly firm, we have a Cournot duopoly? What does the duopoly equilibrium look like?
In choosing the optimal output, the monopolist had only to consider its own costs and the
demand curve that it faced. The duopolist has another factor to consider: how much output will its
rival produce? The more the rival produces, the less market is left for the other firm in the duopoly.
In the Cournot model, each firm looks at the market demand, subtracts what it expects the rival
firm to produce, and chooses its output to maximize its profits based on the market that is left.
Let’s illustrate the Cournot duopoly solution to this problem with two firms, Firm A and
Firm B. Recall the key feature of the duopoly: Firms must take each other’s output into account
when choosing their own output. Given this feature, it is helpful to look at how each firm’s optimal
output might vary with its rival’s output. In Figure 14.2(b), we have drawn two reaction functions,
showing each firm’s optimal,profit-maximizing output as it depends on its rival’s output.The Y-axis
shows levels of Firm A’s output, denoted qA, and the X-axis shows Firm B’s output, denoted as qB.

300
PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government
Several of the points along Firm A’s reaction function should look familiar. Consider the
point where Firm A’s reaction function crosses the vertical axis. At this point, Firm A’s task is to
choose the optimal output assuming Firm B produces 0. But we know what this point is from
solving the monopoly problem. If Firm B produces nothing, then Firm A is a monopolist and it
optimally produces 2,000 units. So if Firm A expects Firm B to produce 0, it should produce 2,000
to maximize its profits.
Look at the point at which Firm A’s reaction function crosses the horizontal axis. At this
point Firm B is producing 4,000 units. Look back at Figure 14.2(a).At an output level of 4,000 units
the market price is $2, which is the marginal cost of production. If Firm A expects Firm B to pro-
duce 4,000 units, there is no profitable market left for Firm A and it will produce 0. If you start
there, where the output of Firm B (measured on the horizontal axis) is 4,000 units each period,
and you let Firm B’s output fall moving to the left, Firm A will find it in its interest to increase
output. If you carefully figure out what Firms A’s profit-maximizing output is at every possible
level of output for Firm B, you will discover that Firm A’s reaction function is just a downward-
sloping line between 2,000 on the Y-axis and 4,000 on the X-axis. The downward slope reflects
the way in which firm A chooses its output. It looks at the market demand, subtracts its rival’s
output, and then chooses its own optimal output. The more the rival produces, the less market is
profitably left for the other firm in the duopoly.
Next, we do the same thing for Firm B. How much will Firm B produce if it maximizes profit
and accepts Firm A’s output as given? Since the two firms are exactly alike in costs and type of
product, Firm B’s reaction function looks just like Firm A’s: When Firm B thinks it is alone in the
market (Firm A’s output on the vertical axis is 0) it produces the monopoly output of 2,000; when
Firm B thinks Firm A is going to produce 4,000 units, it chooses to produce 0.
As you can see, the two reaction functions cross. Each firm’s reaction function shows what it
wants to do, conditional on the other firm’s output. At the point of intersection, each firm is
doing the best it can, given the actual output of the other firm. This point is sometimes called the
best response equilibrium.As you can see from the graph, the Cournot duopoly equilibrium to this
problem occurs when each firm is producing 1,333.33 units for an industry total of 2,666.66.
This output is more than the original monopolist produced in this market, but less than the
4,000 units that a competitive industry would produce.
It turns out that the crossing point is the only equilibrium point in Figure 14.2(b). To see why,
consider what happens if you start off with a monopoly and then let a second firm compete.
Suppose, for example, Firm A expected Firm B to stay out of the market, to produce nothing, leav-
ing Firm A as a monopolist. With that expectation, Firm A would choose to produce 2,000 units.
But now look at Firm B’s reaction function. If Firm A is now producing 2,000 units, Firm B’s
profit-maximizing output is not zero, it is 1,000 units. Draw a horizontal line from Firm A’s out-
put level of 2,000 to Firm B’s reaction function and then go down to the X-axis and you will dis-
cover that Firm B’s optimal output lies at 1,000 units. So an output level for Firm A of 2,000 units
is not an equilibrium because it was predicated on a production level for Firm B that was incor-
rect. Going one step further, with Firm B now producing 1,000 units, Firm A will cut back from
2,000. This will in turn lead to a further increase in Firm B’s output and the process will go on
until both are producing 1,333.33.
As we have seen, the output level predicted by the Cournot model is between that of the
monopoly and that of a perfectly competitive industry. Later extensions of the Cournot model
tell us that the more firms we have, behaving as Cournot predicted, the closer output (and thus
prices) will be to the competitive levels. This type of intuitive result is one reason the Cournot
model has been widely used despite its simplified view of firm interaction. The field of game the-
ory, to which we now turn, offers a more sophisticated and complete view of firm interactions.
Game Theory
The firms in Cournot’s model do not anticipate the moves of the competition. Instead, they try to
guess the output levels of their rivals and then choose optimal outputs of their own. But notice,
the firms do not try to anticipate or influence what the rival firms will do in response to their own
actions. In many situations, it does not seem realistic for firms to just take their rival’s output as

independent of their own. We might think that Intel, recognizing how important Advanced
Micro Devices (AMD) is in the processor market, would try to influence AMD’s business deci-
sions. Game theory is a subfield of economics that analyzes the choices made by rival firms, peo-
ple, and even governments when they are trying to maximize their own well-being while
anticipating and reacting to the actions of others in their environment.
Game theory began in 1944 with the work of mathematician John von Neumann and econ-
omist Oskar Morgenstern who published path-breaking work in which they analyzed a set of
problems, or games, in which two or more people or organizations pursue their own interests and
in which neither one of them can dictate the outcome. Game theory has become an increasingly
popular field of study and research. The notions of game theory have been applied to analyses of
firm behavior, politics, international relations, nuclear war, military strategy, and foreign policy.
In 1994, the Nobel Prize in Economic Science was awarded jointly to three early game theorists:
John F. Nash of Princeton University, John C. Harsanyi of the University of California at Berkeley,
and Reinhard Selten of the University of Bonn. You may have seen the movie A Beautiful Mind
about John Nash and his contribution to game theory.
Game theory begins by recognizing that in all conflict situations, there are decision makers
(or players), rules of the game, and payoffs (or prizes). Players choose strategies without knowing
with certainty what strategy the opposition will use. At the same time, though, some information
that indicates how their opposition may be “leaning” may be available to the players. Most cen-
trally, understanding that the other players are also trying to do their best will be helpful in pre-
dicting their actions.
Figure 14.3 illustrates what is called a payoff matrix for a simple game. Each of two firms, A
and B, must decide whether to mount an expensive advertising campaign. If each firm decides
not to advertise, it will earn a profit of $50,000. If one firm advertises and the other does not, the
firm that does will increase its profit by 50 percent (to $75,000) while driving the competition
into the loss column. If both firms decide to advertise, they will each earn profits of $10,000. They
may generate a bit more demand by advertising, but not enough to offset the expense of the
advertising.
If firms A and B could collude (and we assume that they cannot), their optimal strategy
would be to agree not to advertise. That solution maximizes the joint profits to both firms. If
both firms do not advertise, joint profits are $100,000. If both firms advertise, joint profits are
only $20,000. If only one of the firms advertises, joint profits are $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000.
We see from Figure 14.3 that each firm’s payoff depends on what the other firm does. In con-
sidering what firms should do, however, it is more important to ask whether a firm’s strategy
depends on what the other firm does. Consider A’s choice of strategy. Regardless of what B does,
it pays A to advertise. If B does not advertise, A makes $25,000 more by advertising than by not
advertising. Thus, A will advertise. If B does advertise, A must advertise to avoid a loss. The same
logic holds for B. Regardless of the strategy pursued by A, it pays B to advertise. A dominant
strategy is one that is best no matter what the opposition does. In this game, both players have a
dominant strategy, which is to advertise.

Market Imperfections and the Role of Government
prisoners’ dilemma
A game
in which the players are
prevented from cooperating
and in which each has a
dominant strategy that leaves
them both worse off than if
they could cooperate.
The result of the game in Figure 14.4 is an example of what is called a prisoners’ dilemma.
The term comes from a game in which two prisoners (call them Ginger and Rocky) are accused
of robbing the local 7-Eleven together, but the evidence is shaky. If both confess, they each get
5 years in prison for armed robbery. If each one refuses to confess, they are convicted of a lesser
charge, shoplifting, and get 1 year in prison each. The problem is that the district attorney has
offered each of them a deal independently. If Ginger confesses and Rocky does not, Ginger goes
free and Rocky gets 7 years. If Rocky confesses and Ginger does not, Rocky goes free and Ginger
gets 7 years. The payoff matrix for the prisoners’ dilemma is given in Figure 14.4.
By looking carefully at the payoffs, you may notice that both Ginger and Rocky have dom-
inant strategies: to confess. That is, Ginger is better off confessing regardless of what Rocky does
and Rocky is better off confessing regardless of what Ginger does. The likely outcome is that
both will confess even though they would be better off if they both kept their mouths shut.
There are many cases in which we see games like this one. In a class that is graded on a curve, all
students might consider agreeing to moderate their performance. But incentives to “cheat” by
studying would be hard to resist. In an oligopoly, the fact that prices tend to be higher than
marginal costs provides incentives for firms to “cheat” on output—restricting agreements by
selling additional units.
Is there any way out of this dilemma? There may be, under circumstances in which the game is
played over and over. Look back at Figure 14.3. The best joint outcome is not to advertise. But the
power of the dominant strategy makes it hard to get to the top-left corner. Suppose firms interact
over and over again for many years. Now opportunities for cooperating are richer. Suppose firm A
decided not to advertise for one period to see how firm B would respond. If firm B continued to
advertise, A would have to resume advertising to survive. Suppose B decided to match A’s strategy.
In this case, both firms might—with no explicit collusion—end up not advertising after A figures
out what B is doing. We return to this in the discussion of repeated games, which follows.
There are many games in which one player does not have a dominant strategy, but in which
the outcome is predictable. Consider the game in Figure 14.5(a) in which C does not have a dom-
inant strategy. If D plays the left strategy, C will play the top strategy. If D plays the right strategy, C
will play the bottom strategy. What strategy will D choose to play? If C knows the options, it will
see that D has a dominant strategy and is likely to play that same strategy. D does better playing the
right-hand strategy regardless of what C does. D can guarantee a $100 win by choosing right and
is guaranteed to win nothing by playing left. Because D’s behavior is predictable (it will play the
right-hand strategy), C will play bottom.When all players are playing their best strategy given what
their competitors are doing, the result is called a Nash equilibrium, named after John Nash. We
have already seen one example of a Nash equilibrium in the Cournot model.

Both players have a dominant strategy and will confess. If Rocky does not confess, Ginger will because going
free beats a year in jail. Similarly, if Rocky does confess, Ginger will confess because 5 years in the slammer is
better than 7. Rocky has the same set of choices. If Ginger does not confess, Rocky will because going free
beats a year in jail. Similarly, if Ginger does confess, Rocky also will confess because 5 years in the slammer is
better than 7. Both will confess regardless of what the other does.

In the original game (a), C does not have a dominant strategy. If D plays left, C plays top; if D plays right, C
plays bottom. D, on the other hand, does have a dominant strategy: D will play right regardless of what C
does. If C believes that D is rational, C will predict that D will play right. If C concludes that D will play right,
C will play bottom. The result is a Nash equilibrium because each player is doing the best that it can given
what the other is doing.
In the new game (b), C had better be very sure that D will play right because if D plays left and C plays bot-
tom, C is in big trouble, losing $10,000. C will probably play top to minimize the potential loss if the proba-
bility of D’s choosing left is at all significant.

maximin strategy
In game
theory, a strategy chosen to
maximize the minimum gain
that can be earned.
Now suppose the game in Figure 14.5(a) were changed. Suppose all the payoffs are the same
except that if D chooses left and C chooses bottom, C loses $10,000, as shown in Figure 14.5(b).
While D still has a dominant strategy (playing right), C now stands to lose a great deal by choosing
bottom on the off chance that D chooses left instead. When uncertainty and risk are introduced,
the game changes. C is likely to play top and guarantee itself a $100 profit instead of playing bot-
tom and risk losing $10,000 in the off chance that D plays left. A maximin strategy is a strategy
chosen by a player to maximize the minimum gain that it can earn. In essence, one who plays a
maximin strategy assumes that the opposition will play the strategy that does the most damage.
Repeated Games
Clearly, games are not played once. Firms must decide on advertising budgets, investment strate-
gies, and pricing policies continuously. Pepsi and Coca-Cola have competed against each other
for 100 years, in countries across the globe. While explicit collusion violates the antitrust statutes,
strategic reaction does not. Yet strategic reaction in a repeated game may have the same effect as
tacit collusion.
Consider the game in Figure 14.6. Suppose British Airways and Lufthansa were competing
for business on the New York to London route during the off-season. To lure travelers, they were
offering low fares. The question is how much to lower fares. Both airlines were considering a deep
reduction to a fare of $400 round-trip or a moderate one to $600. Suppose costs are such that
each $600 ticket produces profit of $400 and each $400 ticket produces profit of $200.
Clearly, demand is sensitive to price. Assume that studies of demand elasticity have deter-
mined that if both airlines offer tickets for $600, they will attract 6,000 passengers per week (3,000
for each airline) and each airline will make a profit of $1.2 million per week ($400 dollar profit
times 3,000 passengers). However, if both airlines offer deeply reduced fares of $400, they will
attract 2,000 additional customers per week for a total of 8,000 (4,000 for each airline). While
they will have more passengers, each ticket brings in less profit and total profit falls to $800,000
per week ($200 profit times 4,000 passengers). In this example, we can make some inferences
about demand elasticity. With a price cut from $600 to $400, revenues fall from $3.6 million
(6,000 passengers times $600) to $3.2 million (8,000 passengers times $400). We know from
Chapter 5 that if a price cut reduces revenue, we are operating on an inelastic portion of the
demand curve.

304
PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government
What if the two airlines offer different prices? To keep things simple, we will ignore brand
loyalty and assume that whichever airline offers the lowest fare gets all of the 8,000 passengers. If
British Airways offers the $400 fare, it will sell 8,000 tickets per week and make $200 profit each,
for a total of $1.6 million. Since Lufthansa holds out for $600, it sells no tickets and makes no
profit. Similarly, if Lufthansa were to offer tickets for $400, it would make $1.6 million per week
while British Airways would make zero.
Looking carefully at the payoff matrix in Figure 14.6, do you conclude that either or both of the
airlines have a dominant strategy? In fact, both do. If Lufthansa prices at $600, British Airways will
price at the lower fare of $400, because $1.6 million per week is more than $1.2 million. On the
other hand, if Lufthansa offers the deep price cut, British Airways must do so as well. If British
Airways does not, it will earn nothing, and $800,000 beats nothing! Similarly, Lufthansa has a dom-
inant strategy to offer the $400 fare because it makes more regardless of what British Airways does.
The result is that both airlines will offer the greatly reduced fare and each will make $800,000
per week. This is a classic prisoners’ dilemma. If they were permitted to collude on price, they
would both charge $600 per ticket and make $1.2 million per week instead—a 50 percent increase.
It was precisely this logic that led American Airlines President Robert Crandall to suggest to
Howard Putnam of Braniff Airways in 1983, “I think this is dumb as hell...to sit here and pound
the @#%* out of each other and neither one of us making a @#%* dime.” ... “I have a suggestion
for you, raise your @#%* fares 20 percent. I’ll raise mine the next morning.”
Since competing firms are prohibited from even talking about prices, Crandall got into trouble
with the Justice Department when Putnam turned over a tape of the call in which these comments
were made.But could they have colluded without talking to each other? Suppose prices are announced
each week at a given time. It is like playing the game in Figure 14.6 a number of times in succession, a
repeated game. After a few weeks of making $800,000, British Airways raises its price to $600.
Lufthansa knows that if it sits on its $400 fare,it will double its profit from $800,000 to $1.6 million per
week. But what is British Airways up to? It must know that its profit will drop to zero unless
Lufthansa raises its fare too. The fare increase could just be a signal that both firms would be better
off at the higher price and that if one leads and can count on the other to follow, they will both be
better off. The strategy to respond in kind to a competitor is called a tit-for-tat strategy.
If Lufthansa figures out that British Airways will play the same strategy that Lufthansa is
playing, both will end up charging $600 per ticket and earning $1.2 million instead of charging
$400 and earning only $800,000 per week even though there has been no explicit price fixing.

CHAPTER 14
Oligopoly 305
Suppose I am your professor in an economics class of 100 students. I ask you to bring $10 to
class. In front of the room I place two boxes marked Box A and Box B. I tell you that you must
put the sum of $10 split any way you would like in the two boxes. You can put all $10 in Box A
and nothing in Box B. You can put all $10 in Box B and nothing in Box A. On the other hand,
you can put $2.50 in Box A and $7.50 in Box B. Any combination totaling $10 is all right, and I
am the only person who will ever know how you split up your money.
At the end of the class, every dollar put into Box A will be returned to the person who
put it in. You get back exactly what you put in. But Box B is special. I will add 20 cents to
Box B for every dollar put into it. That is, if there is $100 in the box, I will add $20. But here
is the wrinkle: The money that ends up in Box B, including my 20 percent contribution, will
be divided equally among everyone in the class regardless of the amount that an individual
student puts in.
You can think of Box A as representing a private market where we get what we pay for. We
pay $10, and we get $10 in value back. Think of Box B as representing something we want to do
collectively where the benefits go to all members of the class regardless of whether they have
contributed. In Chapter 12, we discussed the concept of a public good. People cannot be
excluded from enjoying the benefits of a public good once it is produced. Examples include
clean air, a lower crime rate from law enforcement, and national defense. You can think of Box B
as representing a public good.
Now where do you put your money? If you were smart, you would call a class meeting and
get everyone to agree to put his or her entire $10 in Box B. Then everybody would walk out with
$12. There would be $1,000 in the box, I would add $200, and the total of $1,200 would be split
evenly among the 100 students.
But suppose you were not allowed to get together, in the same way that Ginger and Rocky
were kept in separate cells in the jailhouse? Further suppose that everyone acts in his or her best
interest. Everyone plays a strategy that maximizes the amount that he or she walks out with. If
you think carefully, the dominant strategy for each class member is to put all $10 in Box A.
Regardless of what anyone else does, you get more if you put all your money into Box A than you
would get from any other split of the $10. And if you put all your money into A, no one will walk
out of the room with more money than you will!
How can this be? It is simple. Suppose everyone else puts the $10 in B but you put your $10
in A. Box B ends up with $990 plus a 20 percent bonus from me of $198, for a grand total of
$1,188, just $12 short of the maximum possible of $1,200. What do you get? Your share of
Box B—which is $11.88, plus your $10 back, for a total of $21.88. Pretty slimy but clearly opti-
mal for you. If you had put all your money into B, you would get back only $12. You can do the
same analysis for cases in which the others split up their income in any way, and the optimal
strategy is still to put the whole $10 in Box A.
Here is another way to think about it is: What part of what you ultimately get out is linked
to or dependent upon what you put in? For every dollar you put in A, you get a dollar back. For
every dollar you yourself put in B, you get back only 1 cent, one one-hundredth of a dollar,
because your dollar gets split up among all 100 members of the class.
Thus, the game is a classic prisoners’ dilemma, where collusion if it could be enforced would
result in an optimal outcome but where dominant strategies result in a suboptimal outcome.
How do we break this particular dilemma? We call a town meeting (class meeting) and pass
a law that requires us to contribute to the production of public goods by paying taxes. Then, of
course, we run the risk that government becomes a player. We will return to this theme in
Chapters 16 and 18.
To summarize, oligopoly is a market structure that is consistent with a variety of behav-
iors. The only necessary condition of oligopoly is that firms are large enough to have some
control over price. Oligopolies are concentrated industries. At one extreme is the cartel, in
which a few firms get together and jointly maximize profits—in essence, acting as a monop-
olist. At the other extreme, the firms within the oligopoly vigorously compete for small,
contestable markets by moving capital quickly in response to observed profits. In between
are a number of alternative models, all of which emphasize the interdependence of oligopo-
listic firms.

306
PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government
Oligopoly and Economic Performance
How well do oligopolies perform? Should they be regulated or changed? Are they efficient, or do
they lead to an inefficient use of resources? On balance, are they good or bad?
With the exception of the contestable-markets model, all the models of oligopoly we
have examined lead us to conclude that concentration in a market leads to pricing above
marginal cost and output below the efficient level. When price is above marginal cost at
equilibrium, consumers are paying more for the good than it costs to produce that good in
terms of products forgone in other industries. To increase output would be to create value
that exceeds the social cost of the good, but profit-maximizing oligopolists have an incentive
not to increase output.
Entry barriers in many oligopolistic industries also prevent new capital and other
resources from responding to profit signals. Under competitive conditions or in contestable
markets, positive profits would attract new firms and thus increase production. This does
not happen in most oligopolistic industries. The problem is most severe when entry barriers
exist and firms explicitly or tacitly collude. The results of collusion are identical to the results
of a monopoly. Firms jointly maximize profits by fixing prices at a high level and splitting up
the profits.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Price Fixing in Digital Music
In 2010 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decided to reinstate a
case from several years ago alleging that the major music labels
had colluded to keep the prices of digital downloads higher than
they otherwise would be. Earlier cases had found no direct evi-
dence of any price conspiracy. In contrast to some price fixing
cases, there was no trail of secret meetings or phone calls, no
“smoking gun” as the lawyers often say. Instead, as the following
article makes clear, the court relied on economic evidence: the
failure of the major record labels to markedly reduce music prices
despite the drastic reductions in costs associated with moving
from compact discs to digital music.
RIAA Digital Music Price-Fixing 
Case Reinstated
ZeroPaid.com
It’s been an open secret that record labels have long col-
luded with one another to ensure maximum profits with lim-
ited competition and consumer choice. A group of plaintiffs
has taken the RIAA to court over the matter, and after ini-
tially having to watch the case dismissed at the District
Court level back in 2008, has now convinced a three-judge
panel at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to reinstate
the case.
One of the major points of evidence of collusion is that
the price of digital music is still too similar to physical CDs
despite the obviously drastic reduction in price asso-
ciated with distributing it, something file-sharers have
argued all along.
The judges note:
Moreover, the pricing of CDs accounted for costs such as
copying the compact discs; producing the CD case, labels
and anti-shoplifting packaging; shipping, both to the distribu-
tor and then to record stores; labor, such as shelving CDs and
staffing cash registers; and damaged and unsold inventory. All
of these costs were eliminated with Internet Music. However,
these dramatic cost reductions were not accompanied by
dramatic price reductions for Internet Music, as would 
be expected in a competitive market.
In other words, an album that once fetched $15 on store
shelves should now cost much less being that the label has
much fewer costs to recoup.

(Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1952).
On the other hand, it is useful to ask why oligopolies exist in an industry in the first place and
what benefits larger firms might bring to a market. When there are economies of scale, larger and
fewer firms bring cost efficiencies even as they reduce price competition.
Vigorous product competition among oligopolistic competitors may produce variety and
lead to innovation in response to the wide variety of consumer tastes and preferences. The con-
nection between market structure and the rate of innovation is the subject of some debate in
research literature.
Industrial Concentration and Technological Change
One of the major sources of economic growth and progress throughout history has been techno-
logical advance. Innovation, both in methods of production and in the creation of new and bet-
ter products, is one of the engines of economic progress. Much innovation starts with R&D
efforts undertaken by firms in search of profit.
Several economists, notably Joseph Schumpeter and John Kenneth Galbraith, argued in
works now considered classics that industrial concentration, where a relatively small number of
firms control the marketplace, actually increases the rate of technological advance. As
Schumpeter put it in 1942:
As soon as we...inquire into the individual items in which progress was most conspicuous,
the trail leads not to the doors of those firms that work under conditions of comparatively
free competition but precisely to the doors of the large concerns ...and a shocking suspicion
dawns upon us that big business may have had more to do with creating that standard of
life than keeping it down.1
This interpretation caused the economics profession to pause and take stock of its theories. The
conventional wisdom had been that concentration and barriers to entry insulate firms from com-
petition and lead to sluggish performance and slow growth.
The evidence concerning where innovation comes from is mixed. Certainly, most small busi-
nesses do not engage in R&D and most large firms do. When R&D expenditures are considered as
a percentage of sales, firms in industries with high concentration ratios spend more on R&D than
firms in industries with low concentration ratios.
Many oligopolistic companies do considerable research. In the opening segment of this
chapter, we noted three firms dominated the medical devices market—Johnson & Johnson,
Boston Scientific, and Medtronic. Each of these firms spends more than 10 percent of its rev-
enues on R&D. Johnson & Johnson alone spent $8 billion on R&D in 2007. Microsoft spends a
similar amount.
However, the “high-tech revolution” grew out of many tiny start-up operations. Companies
such as Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems, and even Microsoft barely existed only a generation
ago. The new biotechnology firms that are just beginning to work miracles with genetic engi-
neering are still tiny operations that started with research done by individual scientists in univer-
sity laboratories.
Significant ambiguity on this subject remains. Indeed, there may be no right answer.
Technological change seems to come in fits and starts, sometimes from small firms and some-
times from large ones.
The Role of Government
As we suggested earlier, one way that oligopolies increase the market concentration is through
mergers. Not surprisingly, the government has passed laws to control the growth of market power
through mergers.

Regulation of Mergers
The Clayton Act of 1914 (as mentioned in Chapter 13) had given government the authority to
limit mergers that might “substantially lessen competition in an industry.” The Celler-Kefauver
Act (1950) enabled the Justice Department to monitor and enforce these provisions. In the early
years of the Clayton Act, firms that wanted to merge knew there was a risk of government oppo-
sition. Firms could spend large amounts of money on lawyers and negotiation. Firms could
spend resources on negotiations only to have the government take the firms to court.
In 1968, the Justice Department issued its first guidelines designed to reduce uncertainty
about the mergers it would find acceptable. The 1968 guidelines were strict. For example, if the
largest four firms in an industry controlled 75 percent or more of a market, an acquiring firm
with a 15 percent market share would be challenged if it wanted to acquire a firm that controlled
as little as an additional 1 percent of the market.
In 1982, the Antitrust Division—in keeping with President Reagan’s hands-off policy toward
big business—issued a new set of guidelines. Revised in 1984, they remain in place today. The
standards are based on a measure of market structure called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
(HHI). The HHI is calculated by expressing the market share of each firm in the industry as a
percentage, squaring these figures, and summing. For example, in an industry in which two firms
each control 50 percent of the market, the index is
502 + 502 = 2,500 + 2,500 = 5,000
For an industry in which four firms each control 25 percent of the market, the index is
252 + 252 + 252 + 252 = 625 + 625 + 625 + 625 = 2,500
Table 14.2 shows HHI calculations for several hypothetical industries. The Justice Department’s
courses of action,summarized in Figure 14.7,are as follows: If the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is less
than 1,000, the industry is considered unconcentrated and any proposed merger will go unchallenged
by the Justice Department. If the index is between 1,000 and 1,800, the department will challenge any

merger that would increase the index by over 100 points. Herfindahl indexes above 1,800 mean that
the industry is considered concentrated already, and the Justice Department will challenge any merger
that pushes the index up more than 50 points.
You should be able to see that the HHI combines two features of an industry that we identified as
important in our Five Forces discussion: the number of firms in an industry and their relative sizes.
In the previous arithmetic example, we looked at the share of the market controlled by each
of several firms. Before we can make these calculations, however, we have to answer another
question: How do we define the market? What are we taking a share of? Think back to our dis-
cussion of market power in Chapter 13. Coca-Cola has a “monopoly” in the production of Coke
but is one of several firms making cola products, one of many more firms making soda in gen-
eral, and one of hundreds of firms making beverages. Coca-Cola’s market power depends on
how much substitutability there is among cola products, among sodas in general, and among
beverages in general. Before the government can calculate an HHI, it must define the market, a
task that involves figuring out which products are good substitutes for the products in question.
An interesting example of the difficulty in defining markets and the use of the HHI in merger
analysis comes from the 1997 opposition by the FTC to the proposed merger between Staples and
Office Depot. At that time, Office Depot and Staples were the number one and number two firms,
respectively, in terms of market share in dedicated sales of office supplies. The FTC argued that in
sales of office supplies, office superstores such as Office Depot and Staples had a strong advantage in
the mind of the consumer. As a result of the one-stop shopping that they offered, it was argued that
other stores selling stationery were not good substitutes for the sales of these two stores. So the FTC
defined the market over which it intended to calculate the HHI to decide on the merger as the sale of
office supplies in office superstores. Practically, this meant that stationery sold in the corner shop or in
Wal-Mart was not part of the market, not a substantial constraint on the pricing of Office Depot or
Staples. Using this definition, depending on where in the United States one looked, the HHI resulting
from the proposed merger was between 5,000 and 10,000, clearly above the threshold. Economists
working for Staples, on the other hand, argued that the market should include all sellers of office sup-
plies. By that definition, a merger between Office Depot and Staples would result in a HHI well below
the threshold since these two firms together controlled only 5 percent of the total market and the HHI
in the overall market was well below 1,000. In the end, the merger was not allowed.
In Table 14.3, we present HHIs for a few different markets. Notice in one case—Las Vegas
gaming—that the market has both a product and a geographic component. This definition,
which was used by the government in one merger case, assumes that casinos in Las Vegas do not
effectively compete with casinos in Atlantic City, for example. Other markets (for example, beer)
are national markets. In general, the broader the definition of the market, the lower the HHI.

actions by a group of firms that are profitable for each of them only as the result of the
accommodating reactions of others. This behavior includes tacit or express collusion, and
may or may not be lawful in and of itself. 2
In 1997, the Department of Justice and the FTC issued joint Horizontal Merger Guidelines,
updating and expanding the 1984 guidelines. The most interesting part of the new provisions is
that the government examines each potential merger to determine whether it enhances the firms’
power to engage in “coordinated interaction” with other firms in the industry. The guidelines
define “coordinated interaction” as

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government
A Proper Role?
Certainly, there is much to guard against in the behavior of large, concentrated industries.
Barriers to entry, large size, and product differentiation all lead to market power and to potential
inefficiency. Barriers to entry and collusive behavior stop the market from working toward an
efficient allocation of resources.
For several reasons, however, economists no longer attack industry concentration with the
same fervor they once did. First, even firms in highly concentrated industries can be pushed to
produce efficiently under certain market circumstances. Second, the benefits of product differen-
tiation and product competition are real. After all, a constant stream of new products and new
variations of old products comes to the market almost daily. Third, the effects of concentration
on the rate of R&D spending are, at worst, mixed. It is true that large firms do a substantial
amount of the total research in the United States. Finally, in some industries, substantial
economies of scale simply preclude a completely competitive structure.
In addition to the debate over the desirability of industrial concentration, there is a never-
ending debate concerning the role of government in regulating markets. One view is that high lev-
els of concentration lead to inefficiency and that government should act to improve the allocation
of resources—to help the market work more efficiently. This logic has been used to justify the laws
and other regulations aimed at moderating noncompetitive behavior.
An opposing view holds that the clearest examples of effective barriers to entry are those cre-
ated by government. This view holds that government regulation in past years has been ultimately
anticompetitive and has made the allocation of resources less efficient than it would have been
with no government involvement. Recall from Chapter 13 that those who earn positive profits
have an incentive to spend resources to protect themselves and their profits from competitors. This
rent-seeking behavior may include using the power of government.
Complicating the debate further is international competition. Increasingly, firms are faced
with competition from foreign firms in domestic markets at the same time they are competing
with other multinational firms for a share of foreign markets. We live in a truly global economy
today. Thus, firms that dominate a domestic market may be fierce competitors in the interna-
tional arena. This has implications for the proper role of government. Some contend that instead
of breaking up AT&T, the government should have allowed it to be a bigger, stronger interna-
tional competitor. We will return to this debate in a later chapter.

MARKET STRUCTURE IN AN OLIGOPOLY p. 294
1. An oligopoly is an industry dominated by a few firms that, by
virtue of their individual sizes, are large enough to influence
market price. The behavior of a single oligopolistic firm
depends on the reactions it expects of all the other firms in
the industry. Industrial strategies usually are very compli-
cated and difficult to generalize about.
2. The Five Forces model is a helpful way to organize economic
knowledge about the structure of oligopolistic industries. By
gathering data on an industry’s structure in terms of the
existing rivals, new entrants, substitutes, and buyer and sup-
plier characteristics, we can better understand the sources of
excess profits in an industry.
OLIGOPOLY MODELS p. 297
3. When firms collude, either explicitly or tacitly, they jointly
maximize profits by charging an agreed-to price or by setting
output limits and splitting profits. The result is the same as it
would be if one firm monopolized the industry: The firm
will produce up to the point at which MR = MC, and price
will be set above marginal cost.
4. The price-leadership model of oligopoly leads to a result
similar but not identical to the collusion model. In this
organization, the dominant firm in the industry sets a price
and allows competing firms to supply all they want at that
price. An oligopoly with a dominant price leader will pro-
duce a level of output between what would prevail under
competition and what a monopolist would choose in the
same industry. An oligopoly will also set a price between the
monopoly price and the competitive price.
5. The Cournot model of oligopoly is based on three assump-
tions: (1) that there are few firms in an industry, (2) that
each firm takes the output of the other as a given, and
(3) that firms maximize profits. The model holds that a
series of output-adjustment decisions leads to a final level of
output between that which would prevail under perfect
competition and that which would be set by a monopoly.
GAME THEORY p. 300
6. Game theory analyzes the behavior of firms as if their
behavior were a series of strategic moves and counter-
moves. It helps us understand the problem of oligopoly

4. Assume that you are in the business of building houses. You
have analyzed the market carefully, and you know that at a price
of $120,000, you will sell 800 houses per year. In addition, you
know that at any price above $120,000, no one will buy your
houses because the government provides equal-quality houses
to anyone who wants one at $120,000. You also know that for
every $20,000 you lower your price, you will be able to sell an
additional 200 units. For example, at a price of $100,000, you
can sell 1,000 houses; at a price of $80,000, you can sell
1,200 houses; and so on.
a. Sketch the demand curve that your firm faces.
b. Sketch the effective marginal revenue curve that your 
firm faces.
c. If the marginal cost of building a house is $100,000, how
many will you build and what price will you charge? What if
MC = $85,000?
5. The matrix in Figure 1 on the following page shows payoffs based
on the strategies chosen by two firms. If they collude and hold
prices at $10, each firm will earn profits of $5 million. If A cheats
on the agreement, lowering its price, but B does not, A will get 
75 percent of the business and earn profits of $8 million and 
B will lose $2 million. Similarly, if B cheats and A does not, B will
earn $8 million and A will lose $2 million. If both firms cut
prices, they will end up with $2 million each in profits.

for A and for B? If you were A, which strategy would you
choose? Why? If A cheats, what will B do? If B cheats, will A
do? What is the most likely outcome of such a game? Explain.

ment the authority to limit mergers that might “substantially

(1950) enabled the Justice Department to move against a
proposed merger. Currently, the Justice Department uses the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to determine whether it will
challenge a proposed merger.

We come now to our last broad type
of market structure: monopolistic
competition. Like perfect compe-
tition, a monopolistically com-
petitive industry is an industry in
which entry is easy and many
firms are the norm. In contrast to
the perfectly competitive firm,
however, firms in this industry
type do not produce homoge-
neous goods. Rather, each firm
produces a slightly different ver-
sion of a product. These product
differences give rise to some mar-
ket power. In the monopolistically competitive industry, a firm can charge a higher price than
a competitor and not lose all of its customers. We will spend some time in this chapter look-
ing at pricing in these industries.
But pricing is only one part of the story in these industries. When we look at firms in an
industry characterized by monopolistic competition, we naturally focus on how firms make deci-
sions about what kinds of products to sell and how to market and advertise them. Why do we see
a dozen different types of shampoo in a store? Is a dozen too many, too few, or just the right
amount? Why are beverages and automobiles advertised a great deal but semiconductors and
economics textbooks are not? Advertising is expensive: Is it a waste of money, or does it serve
some social function? In this chapter, we will also explore briefly some ideas from behavioral
economics. Can consumers ever be offered too many choices? Why does nutritional cereal sell bet-
ter in the extra large size while candy sells better by the bar?
By the end of this chapter, we will have covered the four basic types of market structure.
Figure 15.1 summarizes the four types: perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, and
monopolistic competition. The behavior of firms in an industry, the key decisions facing
firms, and the key policy issues government faces in dealing with those firms differ depending
on the market structure we are in. Although not every industry fits neatly into one of these
categories, they do provide a useful and convenient framework for thinking about industry
structure and behavior.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Industry Characteristics
A monopolistically competitive industry has the following characteristics:
1. A large number of firms
2. No barriers to entry
3. Product differentiation
While pure monopoly and perfect competition are rare, monopolistic competition is com-
mon in the United States, for example, in the restaurant business. In a Yahoo search of
San Francisco restaurants, there are 8,083 listed in the area. Each produces a slightly different
product and attempts to distinguish itself in consumers’ minds. Entry to the market is not
blocked. At one location near Union Square in San Francisco, five different restaurants opened
and went out of business in 5 years. Although many restaurants fail, small ones can compete and
survive because there are few economies of scale in the restaurant business.
The feature that distinguishes monopolistic competition from monopoly and oligopoly is
that firms that are monopolistic competitors cannot influence market price by virtue of their size.
No one restaurant is big enough to affect the market price of a prime rib dinner even though all
restaurants can control their own prices. Instead, firms gain control over price in monopolistic
competition by differentiating their products.You make it in the restaurant business by producing
a product that people want that others are not producing or by establishing a reputation for good
food and good service. By producing a unique product or establishing a particular reputation, a
firm becomes, in a sense, a “monopolist”—that is, no one else can produce the exact same good.
The feature that distinguishes monopolistic competition from pure monopoly is that good
substitutes are available in a monopolistically competitive industry. With 8,083 restaurants in the
San Francisco area, there are dozens of good Italian, Chinese, and French restaurants.
San Francisco’s Chinatown, for example, has about 50 small Chinese restaurants, with over a
dozen packed on a single street. The menus are nearly identical, and they all charge virtually the
same prices. At the other end of the spectrum are restaurants, with established names and prices
far above the cost of production, that are always booked. That is the goal of every restaurateur
who ever put a stockpot on the range.
Table 15.1 presents some data on nine national manufacturing industries that have the charac-
teristics of monopolistic competition.Each of these industries includes hundreds of individual firms,
some larger than others, but all small relative to the industry. The top four firms in book printing, for
example, account for 33 percent of total shipments. The top 20 firms account for 68 percent of the
market, while the market’s remaining 41 percent is split among almost 540 separate firms.
Firms in a monopolistically competitive industry are small relative to the total market. New
firms can enter the industry in pursuit of profit, and relatively good substitutes for the firms’
products are available. Firms in monopolistically competitive industries try to achieve a degree of
market power by differentiating their products—by producing something new, different, or bet-
ter or by creating a unique identity in the minds of consumers. To discuss the behavior of such
firms, we begin with product differentiation and advertising.

CHAPTER 15
Monopolistic Competition 315
Product Differentiation and Advertising
Monopolistically competitive firms achieve whatever degree of market power they command
through product differentiation. But what determines how much differentiation we see in a
market and what form it takes?
How Many Varieties?
As you look around your neighborhood, notice the sidewalks that connect individual homes with
the common outside walk. In some areas, you will see an occasional brick or cobblestone walk,
but in most places in the United States, these sidewalks are made of concrete. In almost every
case, that concrete is gray. Now look at the houses that these sidewalks lead up to. Except in devel-
opments with tight controls, house colors vary across the palette. Why do we have one variety of
concrete sidewalk while we have multiple varieties of house colors?
Whenever we see limited varieties of a product, a first thought might be that all consumers—
here homeowners—have similar preferences. Perhaps everyone has a natural affection for gray, at
least in concrete. The wide variety in the colors of the houses that these sidewalks lead up to might
make you skeptical of this explanation, but it is possible. Another possible explanation for the
common gray sidewalks might be a desire for coordination: Maybe everyone wants his or her side-
walk to look like the neighbor’s, and the fact that the sidewalk connecting the houses—often pro-
vided by the city—is gray serves to make gray a focal point. In fashion, for example, coordination
and conformity play an enormous role. There is no inherent reason that oversized jeans should be
more or less attractive than narrow-cut, low-rise jeans except that they are made so at certain times
by the fact that many people are wearing them. Again, you might wonder why conformity is
important in sidewalk color but not in house color, something even more visible to the neighbors.
In explaining the narrow variety of concrete sidewalks, a better explanation may come from
a review of the material we covered in Chapter 8 when we looked at cost structures. As you know,
concrete is made in large mixer trucks. The average capacity of these trucks is 9 or more cubic
yards, well more than you would need for a sidewalk. An obvious way to color this concrete is to
mix a coloring agent in the mixer truck along with the cement and other ingredients. When done
this way, however, we need to find several neighbors who want the same color cement that we
want at the same time—concrete is not storable. Even doing it this way is potentially problematic
because the inside of the mixer unit can be affected, leaving a residue of our purple concrete, for
example, for the next customer. Alternatively, we could add dye after the concrete comes out of
the truck, which is done in some places, but the resulting colors are limited, and the process is
expensive. So the lack of variety in concrete and not in houses may reflect the scale economies in
homogeneous production of concrete not found in house painting.
The example of the sidewalks versus the houses helps explain the wide variety in some prod-
uct areas and the narrowness in others. In some cases, consumers may have very different tastes. It
should be no surprise that immigration brings with it an increase in the variety of restaurant
types in an area and in the food offerings at the local grocery store. Immigration typically

Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
increases the heterogeneity of consumer tastes. Product variety is narrower when there are gains
to coordination. In Chapter 13, we described products in which there are network externalities.
Here coordination needs can dramatically narrow product choice. For example, it will be more
important to most people to use the same word-processing program their friends use than to use
one that suits them perfectly. Finally, scale economies that make producing different varieties
more expensive than a single type can reduce variety. People prefer a relatively inexpensive stan-
dardized good over a more expensive custom product that perfectly suits them. The development
of the Levitt house in the postwar period in Pennsylvania and New York was a testament to the
cost savings in housing that came from standardization, creating uniform tract houses for afford-
able prices.
In sum, in well-working markets, the level of product variety reflects the underlying hetero-
geneity of consumers’ tastes in that market, the gains if any from coordination, and cost
economies from standardization. In industries that are monopolistically competitive, differences
in consumer tastes, lack of need for coordination, and modest or no scale economies from stan-
dardization give rise to a large number of firms, each of which has a different product. Even
within this industry structure, however, these same forces play a role in driving levels of variety.
In recent years, quite a few people have taken up the sport of running. The market has
responded in a big way. Now there are numerous running magazines; hundreds of orthotic shoes
designed specifically for runners with particular running styles; running suits of every color, cloth,
and style; weights for the hands, ankles, and shoelaces; tiny radios to slip into sweatbands; and so on.
Even physicians have differentiated their products: Sports medicine clinics have diets for runners,
therapies for runners, and doctors specializing in shin splints or Morton’s toe.
Why has this increase in variety in the running market taken place? More runners—each
with a different body, running style, and sense of aesthetics—increase consumer heterogeneity.
The increased market size also tells us that if you produce a specialized running product, it is
more likely you will sell enough to cover whatever fixed costs you had in developing the product.
So market size allows for more variety. New York has a wider range of ethnic restaurants than
does Eden Prairie, Minnesota, not only because of the difference in the heterogeneity of the pop-
ulations but also because of the sheer size of the two markets.
How Do Firms Differentiate Products?
We have learned that differentiation occurs in response to demands by consumers for products
that meet their individual needs and tastes, constrained by the forces of costs of coordination and
scale economies. We can go one step further and characterize the kinds of differentiation we see
in markets.
Return to the restaurant example we brought up earlier. Of the 8,083 restaurants in San
Francisco, some are French, some are Chinese, and some are Italian. Economists would call this
form of differentiation across the restaurants horizontal differentiation. Horizontal differentia-
tion is a product difference that improves the product for some people but makes it worse for
others. If we were to poll San Francisco residents, asking for the best restaurant in town, we would
undoubtedly get candidates from a number of different categories. Indeed, many people might
not even consider this to be a legitimate question.
If you add sea salt and vinegar to potato chips, that makes them more attractive to some peo-
ple and less attractive to others. Horizontal differentiation creates variety to reflect differences in
consumers’ tastes in the market.
For some products, people choose a type and continue with it for a long time. For many of
us, breakfast cereals have this feature. Day after day we eat Cheerios or corn flakes. Brand prefer-
ence for mayonnaise has the same stability. For dinner, however, most of us are variety-seeking.
Even small cities can support some variety in restaurant types because people get tired of eating
at the same place every week.
People who visit planned economies often comment on the lack of variety. Before the Berlin
Wall came down in 1989 and East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, those who were
allowed passed from colorful and exciting West Berlin into dull and gray East Berlin; variety
seemed to vanish. As the wall came down, thousands of Germans from the East descended on the
department stores of the West. Visitors to China since the economic reforms of the mid-1980s

Products differ in ways that
make them better for some
people and worse for others.

behavioral economics
A branch of economics that
uses the insights of psychology
and economics to investigate
decision making.
3 The subsample of six brands was carefully selected to be neither the best nor the worst of the flavors, and to actually buy, con-
sumers had to go to a shelf that contained all the varieties of jam.
4 Papers described in this paragraph include Klaus W. Ertenbroch,“Self-Rationing: Self-Control in Consumer Choice,” INSEAD
Working Paper, 2001, on the package size topic; Ulrike Malmendier and Stefano Della Vigna,“Paying Not to Go to the Gym,”

claim that the biggest visible sign of change is the increase in the selection of products available to
the population.
Recent work in the area of behavioral economics suggests, however, that there may be times in
which too much variety is a bad thing.2 Behavioral economics is a branch of economics that uses
the insight of psychology and economics to investigate decision making.
Researchers set up an experiment in an upscale grocery, Draeger’s, located in Menlo Park,
California. Draeger’s is known for its large selection, carrying, for example, 250 varieties of
mustard. A tasting booth was set up in the store on two consecutive Saturdays. On one day,
consumers were offered one of six exotic jams to taste, while on the other day, 24 varieties
were offered. The results of the experiment were striking. While more customers approached
the 24-jam booth for a taste than approached the booth with a limited selection, almost none
of the tasters at the 24-jam booth bought anything; in contrast, almost 30 percent of tasters at
the six-jam booth made a purchase.3 The researchers conclude that while some choice is
highly valued by people, too much choice can reduce purchases.
The jam experiment offers a case in which individuals react to a wide range of choices by
not making a choice at all. Behavioral economists also note that when the number of choices is
large, individuals may avoid the decision-making burden by using a rule of thumb or by
reverting to the default option. In the area of retirement savings, for example, some studies
have found a tendency for people to allocate savings evenly across a range of investment
options without paying much attention to the earnings characteristics of those funds. In other
cases, people appear to favor whatever option is the default designated by the government
body or by the firm offering the plan. For this reason, some economists have argued that one
way to increase consumer savings (if that is desirable) is to make participation rather than no
participation the default in pension plans. In this way, individuals would be enrolled in a
retirement plan unless they chose not to be. These plans are called opt-out plans rather than
opt-in plans.
Behavioral economics also has something to say about another form of horizontal 
differentiation—package size and pricing form.4 Many consumer goods come in small, large,
and extra large packages. Many goods (for example, health club visits and magazines) can be
bought per visit or issue or via membership or subscription. Many of us think of these differ-
ences as matters of convenience. Firms can use these differences to create products targeted at
consumer types. Small households buy small boxes of cereals, and large families purchase
extra large sizes. Occasional readers buy Us Weekly on the newsstand, and fans subscribe to
the magazine. Clearly, these kinds of differences play a role. But behavioral economists have
also suggested that some of these differences survive in the market because some consumers
are interested in trying to control their purchasing behavior. People buy small containers of
ice cream but large bottles of vitamins. Why? Because they want to commit themselves to tak-
ing a vitamin every day but only occasionally eating ice cream. People buy memberships to
health clubs as an incentive to work out; they make the marginal cost of a visit zero even
though in the end, they may pay more than they would have by paying a per-visit fee. We sub-
scribe to The Economist but buy Us Weekly on the newsstand at high per-issue prices in the
hopes that we will read more of The Economist and less of Us Weekly. Some students choose
classes that reward attendance as a way of ensuring that they go to class. Firms can be creative
about using product differentiation to offer consumers commitment devices that help them
control their own impulses. A commitment device is an action taken by an individual now to
try to control his or her behavior in the future.
Behavioral economics is an exciting new field that is challenging and deepening our under-
standing of a number of areas of economics. New ideas from behavioral economics have entered
both microeconomics and macroeconomics.

Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
vertical differentiation
A
product difference that, from
everyone’s perspective, makes a
product better than rival
products.
Products can be differentiated not only horizontally but also vertically. A new BMW with
GPS is better than one without for almost everyone. A hard drive with more capacity is better
than one with less. The Hilton is better than a Motel 6 if they are located in the same place. How
can a product survive in a competitive marketplace when another better product is available?
The answer, of course, is in the price. The better products cost more, and only some people find
it worthwhile to pay the higher price to get a better product. So differences among people also
give rise to vertical differentiation. Some people value quality in a specific product more than
others do and are willing to pay for that quality. If you are on a special date, it might be worth-
while to go to the best restaurant in town. On the other hand, while at a casual dinner with
friends, watching your budget might be more important.
We have described the forces that help determine how much differentiation we will see in a
market and the major forms that differentiation can take. We turn now to advertising, which
plays a special role in the area of monopolistic competition.
Advertising
Advertising fits into the differentiation story in two different ways. One role advertising plays is to
inform people about the real differences that exist among products. Advertising can also create or
contribute to product differentiation, creating a brand image for a product that has little to do
with its physical characteristics. We can all think of examples of each type.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
An Economist Makes Tea
You have probably seen Honest Tea, a slightly sweetened bottled iced
tea made from green, black, and herbal blends in your local grocery
store. It is probably not the only iced tea on the shelf. In addition to
the popular brands Lipton and Snapple, you may also see SoBe,
Tazo, and Turkey Hill, depending on where you live. Bottled iced tea
is a classic example of a monopolistically competitive market. None
of the brands are exactly alike. Honest Tea, for example, prides itself
on being made with high-end tea leaves and only a hint of sweetener,
while Snapple uses lower-quality leaves and a hefty dose of sweet-
ener. Nor are the teas priced the same. In a typical store, the retail
price of Honest Tea and SoBe are likely to be about $1.89, while
Snapple would likely cost about $1.39. If you spend time in the bev-
erage aisle of a grocery store, you will notice that despite the higher
price of Honest Tea, some consumers choose it over the alternatives.
What you may not know about Honest Tea is that it was started a
decade ago by Seth Goldman, an entrepreneur, and Barry Nalebuff,
an economist. In figuring out how to differentiate his tea from oth-
ers in the industry, Nalebuff used some of the economic theory that
we covered in Chapter 6 of this book. Look at the following graph,
which shows the placement of one of Honest Tea’s most popular fla-
vors, Green Dragon. The graph shows how taste varies with sugar for
Goldman and Nalebuff’s potential customers. Tea taste improves for
the first few grams of sugar, but shortly begins to flatten out and
then fall. Note that Green Dragon is somewhat to the left of the taste
peak. Some economists looking at this graph criticized Nalebuff for
choosing too little sugar content for his tea. What were the critics
thinking, and why were they wrong?
The critics clearly noticed that Green Dragon is not at the
peak of the taste curve. That is, a little more sugar would improve
the taste of the tea. Why did Nalebuff stop short of that point?
This is product differentiation at its best. Goldman and Nalebuff
are out to produce a new product that will attract demand. That
is, at a reasonable price they must attract consumers away from
other products. Goldman and Nalebuff discovered that sugar
beyond some point adds little taste, yet comes at a health cost—
more calories. Given consumers’ new awareness of healthy and
natural foods, Honest Tea became an overnight success. Since
Nalebuff is an economist, he couldn’t resist a graph on the label
of the tea bottles.

Monopolistic Competition 319
Recent Coca-Cola ads trumpeting the “Coke Side of Life” have little to do with Coke’s
taste, for example. The dancers in iPod’s ads create an image of hip and happy people rather
than describe the technical features of the device. On the other hand, the advertising circulars
in local newspapers carry specific information about what products are on sale that week in
the local grocery store.
In 2006, firms spent about $250 billion on advertising, as Table 15.2 shows. Advertising
reaches us through every medium of communication. Table 15.3 shows national advertising
expenditures by major industrial category. The automobile industry leads the pack with expendi-
tures of nearly $20 billion advertising in 2006. In 2008, 30 seconds of prime commercial advertis-
ing time during Super Bowl XLII cost $2.7 million.

Many observers believe that the Internet is rapidly changing the way advertising works.
Traditionally, companies have targeted their advertisements in both print and media. Beer
commercials are shown during televised sporting events, toy commercials air during chil-
dren’s programs, and so on. The Internet has dramatically improved the ability of advertis-
ing to target a specific market. Consider advertising on Google. Under Google’s AdWords
system, which is a click-and-pay system, advertisers pay only when a Web surfer clicks

to their site. In this way, advertisers are sure that people who see their advertisements 
are interested in the product. In 2006, Google earned over $6 billion from this form of tar-
geted advertising.
YouTube, another new entrant into the advertising business, offers firms the opportu-
nity to actively interact with customers. In addition to the standard video ads, firms can cre-
ate online contests and brand channels to learn from customers about their preferences.
Advertising as information has become more of a transparent two-way street as a result of
the Internet.
The effects of product differentiation in general (and advertising in particular) on the
allocation of resources have been hotly debated for years. Advocates claim that these forces
give the market system its vitality and power. Critics argue that they cause waste and ineffi-
ciency. Before we proceed to the models of monopolistic competition and oligopoly, let us
look at this debate.
The Case for Advertising
For product differentiation to be successful, consumers
must know about product quality and availability. In perfect competition, where all products
are alike, we assume that consumers have perfect information; without it, the market fails to
produce an efficient allocation of resources. Complete information is even more important
when we allow for product differentiation. Consumers get this information through adver-
tising, at least in part. The basic function of advertising, according to its proponents, is to
assist consumers in making informed, rational choices. When we think of advertising, many
of us think of the persuasive ads shown on television geared to changing our image of a
product. Over the years, Budweiser has developed a reputation for clever ads of this sort,
especially those delivered during the Super Bowl. But much advertising is entirely informa-
tional. In most parts of the country, one day a week the newspaper grows in size. On this day,
stores advertise and promote their food sales. For many newspapers, advertisements are a big
source of revenue; and it is all informational, helping consumers figure out where to buy
their orange juice and chicken, for example. During the holiday season, toy advertising, both
in print and on television, increases dramatically. For toys, which have a high rate of new
product introduction, publicizing them is very important.
Supporters of advertising also note that it can promote competition. New products can com-
pete with old, established brands only when promoters can get their messages through to con-
sumers. The standard of living rises when we have product innovation, when new and better
products come on the market. Think of all the products today that did not exist 20 years ago:
iPods, video games like Guitar Hero, and hybrid cars, to name a few. When consumers are
informed about a wide variety of potential substitutes, their market choices help discipline older
firms that may have lost touch with consumers’ tastes.
Even advertising that seems to function mostly to create and reinforce a brand image can
have efficiency effects. Creating a brand name such as Coca-Cola or Tide requires a huge invest-
ment in marketing and advertising. The stronger the brand name and the more a firm has
invested in creating that name, the more the firm will invest in trying to protect that name. In
many cases, those investments provide benefits for consumers. In reacting to the 2007 news about
lead in children’s toys made in China, large toy companies such as Hasbro and Mattel spent
millions in new testing of those toys. Restoring parental trust in the face of the toy recalls is vital
to the future of the firms.
Differentiated products and advertising give the market system its vitality and are the basis of
its power. Product differentiation helps to ensure high quality and variety, and advertising pro-
vides consumers with valuable information on product availability, quality, and price that they
need to make efficient choices in the marketplace.
The Case Against Product Differentiation and Advertising
Product differenti-
ation and advertising waste society’s scarce resources, argue critics. They say enormous sums of
money are spent to create minute, meaningless differences among products.

Can Information Reduce Obesity?
Coming to the Menu: Calorie Counts
The Wall Street Journal
Chowing down on calorie-laden food at chain restaurants is
going to become more of a guilt trip.
The health bill President Barack Obama signed into law
Tuesday requires that restaurant chains post calorie counts
for all the food items they sell. The law covers any chain with
at least 20 outlets, amounting to more than 200,000 restau-
rants nationwide.
“Dining out no longer has to be a nutritional guessing
game,” said Margo G. Wootan, director of nutrition policy
with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit
health-advocacy group based in Washington. “People could
cut hundreds, thousands, of calories from their diet.”
Calorie counts must be listed on menus, menu boards,
drive-through displays and vending machines under the law.
Additional information—such as sodium levels, carbohy-
drates and saturated fats—must be available on request.
Temporary specials and custom orders are exempted. 
A growing number of state, county and local regulations
already require similar disclosures, and those rules will be
superceded by the federal law.
There has been debate about whether such menu
labeling actually affects consumers’ behavior. Some recent
studies have found that such labeling leads to healthier eat-
ing: The New York City health department examined the
behavior of 12,000 customers of 13 chain restaurants in 
275 locations in the city before and after menu labeling was
implemented in the city in 2008.
Preliminary results show that one in six fast-food cus-
tomers report using the calorie-count information. Consumers
who said they used the information bought items with 
106 fewer calories compared with those who didn’t see or
use the information. 
Separate studies have shown weak or inconsistent
effects of menu labeling on consumer behavior, according to
a 2008 review of the literature published in the International
Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity.
“Calorie posting in and of itself is not going to change obe-
sity per se, but it’s all of these kinds of layering opportunities
that we’re doing for public health all across the country that are
going to make the difference,” said Cathy Nonas, director of
physical activity and nutrition for the health department in New
York City, a pioneer in adopting menu labeling. 
The National Center for Health Statistics reported in
January that 34 percent of Americans age 20 and older were
obese in 2007–2008.
The restaurant industry is required to come up with a
labeling proposal in one year, but the bill leaves it to Food
and Drug Administration officials to determine specific reg-
ulations, including the printing fonts and their sizes to be
used in calorie displays. Ms. Wootan said it could take
three to four years before diners see the new information
in restaurants. 
One concern about the rules is accuracy. Researchers
from Tufts University who looked into caloric disclosure
from 29 quick-serve and sit-down restaurants found that
restaurants underreported calories by an average of 
18 percent.
Some restaurant owners and groups have supported
labeling regulations, in part because they don’t think such dis-
closures deter patrons from ordering what they want.

Policy makers have been working to increase the level of informa-
tion that consumers have about products. In the early 1990s, the
Food and Drug Administration passed rules requiring most
processed foods sold in grocery stores to carry nutrition labels.
The current hot topic in the labeling area involves restaurant
meals. With obesity growing in the United States, many policy
makers think that one way to fight the problem is to require calo-
rie and fat labeling in restaurants. The following article from The
Wall Street Journal discusses a recent law requiring chain restau-
rants to post calorie counts.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Drugs, both prescription and nonprescription, are an example. Companies spend mil-
lions of dollars to promote brand-name drugs that contain the same compounds as those
available under the generic names. The antibiotics erythromycin and erythrocin have the
same ingredients, yet erythrocin is half as expensive as erythromycin. Aspirin is aspirin, yet
we pay twice the price for an advertised brand because the manufacturer has convinced us
that there is a tangible—or intangible—difference.
Do we really need 50 different kinds of soap, some of whose prices are increased by the
cost of advertising? For a firm producing a differentiated product, advertising is part of
the everyday cost of doing business. Its price is built into the average cost curve and thus
into the price of the product in the short run and the long run. Thus, consumers pay to
finance advertising.
Critics also argue that the information content of advertising is minimal at best and deliber-
ately deceptive at worst. Advertising is meant to change our minds, to persuade us, and to create
brand images. Try to determine how much real information there is in the next 10 advertisements
you see on television. U.S. firms spend about $250 billion a year on advertising. Critics argue that
firms waste a substantial portion of this money if the advertising does not clearly convey infor-
mation to consumers.
Competitive advertising can also easily turn into unproductive warfare. Suppose there are
five firms in an industry and one firm begins to advertise heavily. To survive, the others
respond in kind. Advertising of this sort may not increase demand for the product or improve
profitability for the industry. Instead, it is often a “zero sum game”—a game in which the sum
of the gains equals the sum of the losses.
Advertising may also reduce competition by creating a barrier to the entry of new firms into
an industry. One famous case study taught at the Harvard Business School calculates the cost of
entering the brand-name breakfast cereal market. To be successful, a potential entrant would have
to start with millions of dollars in an extensive advertising campaign to establish a brand name
recognized by consumers. Entry to the breakfast cereal game is not completely blocked, but such
financial requirements make entry very difficult.
Finally, some argue that advertising, by its very nature, imposes a cost on society. We
are continuously bombarded by bothersome jingles and obtrusive images. When driving
home from school or work, we may pass 50 billboards and listen to 15 minutes of news and
20 minutes of advertising on the radio. When we get home, we throw away 10 pieces of
unsolicited junk mail, glance at a magazine containing 50 pages of writing and 75 pages of
advertisements, and perhaps watch a television show that is interrupted every 5 minutes for
a “message.”
The bottom line, critics of product differentiation and advertising argue, is waste and ineffi-
ciency. Enormous sums are spent to create minute, meaningless, and possibly nonexistent differ-
ences among products. Advertising raises the cost of products and frequently contains very little
information. Often, it is merely an annoyance. Advertising can lead to unproductive warfare and
may serve as a barrier to entry, thus reducing real competition.
Open Questions
You will see over and over as you study economics that many ques-
tions remain open. There are strong arguments on both sides of the advertising debate, and
even the empirical evidence yields to conflicting conclusions. Some studies show that adver-
tising leads to concentration and positive profits; others, that advertising improves the func-
tioning of the market.
Price and Output Determination in
Monopolistic Competition
Recall that monopolistically competitive industries are made up of a large number of firms, each
small relative to the size of the total market. Thus, no one firm can affect market price by virtue
of its size alone. Firms do differentiate their products, however, in ways we have been discussing.
By doing so, they gain some control over price.

 FIGURE 15.2 Product Differentiation Reduces the Elasticity of Demand Facing 
a Firm
The demand curve that a monopolistic competitor faces is likely to be less elastic than the demand curve that
a perfectly competitive firm faces. Demand is more elastic than the demand curve that a monopolist faces
because close substitutes for the products of a monopolistic competitor are available.
Product Differentiation and Demand Elasticity
Perfectly competitive firms face a perfectly elastic demand for their product: All firms in a
perfectly competitive industry produce exactly the same product. If firm A tried to raise
prices, buyers would go elsewhere and firm A would sell nothing. When a firm can distin-
guish its product from all others in the minds of consumers, as we assume it can under
monopolistic competition, it probably can raise its price without losing all quantity
demanded. Figure 15.2 shows how product differentiation might make demand somewhat
less elastic for a hypothetical firm.
A monopoly is an industry with a single firm that produces a good for which there are
no close substitutes. A monopolistically competitive firm is like a monopoly in that it is the
only producer of its unique product. Only one firm can produce Cheerios or Wheat Thins or
Johnson’s Baby Shampoo or Oreo cookies. However, unlike the product in a monopoly mar-
ket, the product of a monopolistically competitive firm has many close substitutes compet-
ing for the consumer’s favor. Although the demand curve that a monopolistic competitor
faces is likely to be less elastic than the demand curve that a perfectly competitive firm faces,
it is likely to be more elastic than the demand curve that a monopoly faces.
Price/Output Determination in the Short Run
A profit-maximizing, monopolistically competitive firm behaves much like a monopolist 
in the short run. First, marginal revenue is not equal to price because the monopolistically
competitive firm is different enough from its rivals that small price increases over those
rivals do not eliminate all customers. This firm sees its price respond to its output decisions.
The monopolistic competitor’s marginal revenue curve lies below its demand curve,
intersecting the quantity axis midway between the origin and the point at which the demand
curve intersects it. (If necessary, review Chapter 13 to make sure you understand this 
idea.) The firm chooses the output/price combination that maximizes profit. To maximize
profit, the monopolistically competitive firm will increase production until the marginal
revenue from increasing output and selling it no longer exceeds the marginal cost 
of producing it. This occurs at the point at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost:
MR = MC.

324
PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
In Figure 15.3(a), the profit-maximizing output is q0 = 2,000, where marginal revenue
equals marginal cost. To sell 2,000 units, the firm charges $6, which is the most it can charge
and still sell the 2,000 units. Total revenue is P0  q0 = $12,000, or the area of P0Aq00. Total
cost is equal to average total cost times q0, which is $10,000, or CBq00. Total profit is the dif-
ference, $2,000 (the gray-shaded area P0ABC).
Nothing guarantees that a firm in a monopolistically competitive industry will earn positive
profits in the short run. Figure 15.3(b) shows what happens when a firm with similar cost curves
faces a weaker market demand. Even though the firm does have some control over price, market
demand is insufficient to make the firm profitable.
As in perfect competition, such a firm minimizes its losses by producing up to the point
where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. Of course, as in perfect competition, the
price that the firm charges must be sufficient to cover average variable costs. Otherwise, the
firm will shut down and suffer losses equal to total fixed costs instead of increasing losses by
producing more. In Figure 15.3(b), the loss-minimizing level of output is q1 = 1,000 at a price of
$5. Total revenue is P1  q1 = $5,000, or P1Bq10. Total cost is ATC  q1 = $6,000, or CAq10.
Because total cost is greater than revenue, the firm suffers a loss of $1,000, equal to the pink-
shaded area, CABP1.
Price/Output Determination in the Long Run
Under monopolistic competition, entry and exit are easy in the long run. Firms can enter an
industry when there are profits to be made, and firms suffering losses can go out of business.
However, entry into an industry of this sort is somewhat different from entry into perfect compe-
tition because products are differentiated in monopolistic competition. A firm that enters a
monopolistically competitive industry is producing a close substitute for the good in question,
but not the same good.
Let us begin with a firm earning positive profits in the short run, as shown on the left-hand
side of Figure 15.3. Those profits provide an incentive for new firms to enter the industry. This
entry creates new substitutes for the profit-making firm, which, in turn, drives down demand for
its product. For example, if several restaurants seem to be doing well in a particular location, oth-
ers may start up and take business from the existing restaurants. While firms are not perfect sub-
stitutes, they are similar enough to take business from one another.

Monopolistically Competitive Firm at Long-Run Equilibrium
As new firms enter a monopolistically competitive industry in search of profits, the demand curves of existing
profit-making firms begin to shift to the left, pushing marginal revenue with them as consumers switch to the
new close substitutes. This process continues until profits are eliminated, which occurs for a firm when its
demand curve is just tangent to its average total cost curve.
In profitable markets, new firms continue to enter the market until profits are elimi-
nated. As the new firms enter, the demand curve facing each old firm begins to shift to the
left, pushing the marginal revenue curve along with it. With more entrants, less demand is
left for older firms. This shift continues until profits are eliminated, which occurs when the
demand curve slips down to the average total cost curve. Graphically, this is the point at
which the demand curve and the average total cost curve are tangent (the point at which they
just touch and have the same slope). Figure 15.4 shows a monopolistically competitive
industry in long-run equilibrium. At q* and P*, price and average total cost are equal; so
there are no profits or losses.
Look carefully at the tangency, which in Figure 15.4, is at output level q*. The tangency
occurs at the profit-maximizing level of output. At this point, marginal cost is equal to marginal
revenue. At any level of output other than q*, ATC lies above the demand curve. This means that
at any other level of output, ATC is greater than the price that the firm can charge. (Recall that the
demand curve shows the price that can be charged at every level of output.) Hence, price equals
average total cost at q* and profits equal zero.
This equilibrium must occur at the point at which the demand curve is just tangent to the
average total cost curve. If the demand curve cuts across the average cost curve, intersecting it at
two points, the demand curve would be above the average total cost curve at some levels of out-
put. Producing at those levels of output would mean positive profits. Positive profits would
attract entrants, shifting the market demand curve to the left and lowering profits. If the
demand curve were always below the average total cost curve, all levels of output would produce
losses for the firm. This would cause firms to exit the industry, shifting the market demand
curve to the right and increasing profits (or reducing losses) for those firms still in the industry.
The firm’s demand curve must end up tangent to its average total cost curve for profits to equal
zero. This is the condition for long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive industry.
There is something else to notice about Figure 15.4: The monopolistically competitive firm is
not operating at the lowest point on its average total cost curve. It is producing at a scale smaller
than the one that minimizes its average total cost. In some ways this is the cost of product differ-
entiation: The industry consists of firms that serve individualized tastes of customers, but serving
those different tastes results in higher production costs than we would see if everyone liked the
same thing. Remember our example of the gray sidewalks early in the chapter. Uniform gray side-
walks allows us to lower costs, but the cost is a gray undifferentiated product. In other cases, we
see a rainbow of products, but the firms producing them are all operating at too small a scale.

Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
INDUSTRY CHARACTERISTICS p. 314
1. A monopolistically competitive industry has the following
structural characteristics: (1) a large number of firms, (2) no
barriers to entry, and (3) product differentiation. Relatively
good substitutes for a monopolistic competitor’s products
are available. Monopolistic competitors try to achieve a
degree of market power by differentiating their products.
PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND 
ADVERTISING p. 315
2. The amount of product differentiation in an industry
depends on a number of features of the industry. How
different are customers’ tastes? Are there gains to customers
in buying a product that is identical to one bought by every-
one else? Are there large-scale economies associated with
making only one variety of a good? Industries with many dif-
ferent products reflect strong heterogeneity of consumers,
low gains from coordination, and small cost gains from
standardization.
3. Products can be differentiated horizontally or vertically.
Horizontal differentiation produces different types of a
good with different appeals to different types of people. In
vertical differentiation, people agree that one product is bet-
ter than another; they just may not be willing to pay for the
better good.
Economic Efficiency and Resource
Allocation
We have already noted some of the similarities between monopolistic competition and perfect
competition. Because entry is easy and economic profits are eliminated in the long run, we
might conclude that the result of monopolistic competition is efficient. There are two prob-
lems, however.
First, once a firm achieves any degree of market power by differentiating its product (as is the
case in monopolistic competition), its profit-maximizing strategy is to hold down production
and charge a price above marginal cost, as you saw in Figure 15.3 and Figure 15.4. Remember
from Chapter 12 that price is the value that society places on a good and that marginal cost is the
value that society places on the resources needed to produce that good. By holding production
down and price above marginal cost, monopolistically competitive firms prevent the efficient use
of resources. More product could be produced at a resource cost below the value that consumers
place on the product.
Second, as Figure 15.4 shows, the final equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive firm is
necessarily to the left of the low point on its average total cost curve. That means a typical firm in
a monopolistically competitive industry will not realize all the economies of scale available. (In
perfect competition, you will recall, firms are pushed to the bottom of their long-run average cost
curves, and the result is an efficient allocation of resources.)
Suppose a number of firms enter an industry and build plants on the basis of initially prof-
itable positions. As more firms compete for those profits, individual firms find themselves with
smaller market shares; eventually, they end up with “excess capacity.” The firm in Figure 15.4 is
not fully using its existing capacity because competition drove its demand curve to the left. In
monopolistic competition, we end up with many firms, each producing a slightly different prod-
uct at a scale that is less than optimal. Would it not be more efficient to have a smaller number of
firms, each producing on a slightly larger scale?
The costs of less-than-optimal production, however, need to be balanced against the gains
that can accrue from aggressive competition among products. If product differentiation leads to
the introduction of new products, improvements in old products, and greater variety, an impor-
tant gain in economic welfare may counteract (and perhaps outweigh) the loss of efficiency from
pricing above marginal cost or not fully realizing all economies of scale.
Most industries that comfortably fit the model of monopolistic competition are very com-
petitive. Price competition coexists with product competition, and firms do not earn incredible
profits and do not violate any of the antitrust laws that we discussed in the last chapter.
Monopolistically competitive firms have not been a subject of great concern among economic
policy makers. Their behavior appears to be sufficiently controlled by competitive forces, and no
serious attempt has been made to regulate or control them.

2. Consider the local music scene in your area. Name some of the
local live bands that play in clubs and music halls, both on and
off campus. Look in your local newspaper for advertisements of
upcoming shows or performances. How would you characterize

power? Are there barriers to entry? How profitable do you think

were once a monopolistically competitive firm that became

4. In a market in which there is vertical differentiation, we always
see price differences among the products. In markets with hori-
zontal differentiation, sometimes the products differ but prices
are very much the same. Why does vertical differentiation natu-
rally bring with it price differences?
5. [Related to Economics in Practice on p. 318] If you look at the
prices listed in the Economics in Practice on p. 318, you will see
that the more well-known brands are being sold for a lower
price than the less well-known brands. Is this pattern always
true? Explain your answer.
6. [Related to Economics in Practice on p. 321] The news story
tells us that some restaurant owners oppose the labeling
requirement. Why? Since restaurants compete with one another,
would you not expect some of the healthier restaurants to come
out in favor of the rule? Explain.
7. The table shows the relationship for a hypothetical firm
between its advertising expenditures and the quantity of its out-
put that it expects it can sell at a fixed price of $5 per unit.
4. Behavioral economics suggests that there may be times when
too much variety reduces consumers’ purchases.
5. Behavioral economics also suggests that there may be times
when consumers prefer one form of a good over another as a
way to commit themselves to different actions in the future
than they would otherwise take.
6. Advocates of free and open competition believe that dif-
ferentiated products and advertising give the market sys-
tem its vitality and are the basis of its power. Critics argue
that product differentiation and advertising are wasteful
and inefficient.
PRICE AND OUTPUT DETERMINATION IN
MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION p. 322
7. By differentiating their products, firms hope to be able to
raise prices without losing all demand. The demand curve
facing a monopolistic competitor is less elastic than the
demand curve faced by a perfectly competitive firm but
more elastic than the demand curve faced by a monopoly.
8. To maximize profit in the short run, a monopolistically
competitive firm will produce as long as the marginal rev-
enue from increasing output and selling it exceeds the mar-
ginal cost of producing it.
9. When firms enter a monopolistically competitive industry,
they introduce close substitutes for the goods being pro-
duced. This attracts demand away from the firms already in
the industry. Demand faced by each firm shifts left, and
profits are ultimately eliminated in the long run. This long-
run equilibrium occurs at the point where the demand curve
is just tangent to the average total cost curve.
ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND RESCOURCE
ALLOCATION p. 326
10. Monopolistically competitive firms end up pricing above
marginal cost. This is inefficient, as is the fact that monop-
olistically competitive firms do not realize all economies of
scale available. There may be offsetting gains from
increased variety.

8. In the area around a local university, a number of food vendors
gather each lunchtime to sell food to university students who

Many different cuisines are represented on the street corner,
including a cart sponsored by Madame Defarge selling gumbo
and jambalaya. Madame Defarge sells a plate of either gumbo or
jambalaya for $5. The food is made in the morning at her
nearby restaurant, when the kitchen is otherwise unoccupied.
Her crew of three, each of whom earns $15 per hour, takes
2 hours to make the 100 meals required by Madame Defarge. In
creating these meals, they use ingredients equal to $100.
Madame Defarge hires another worker to load her cart with
food and sell it during the lunch hours. That worker costs
$10 per hour and typically sells out the entire cart of 100 meals
in 2 hours. The cart is rented for $100 per 5-day week. (The
carts are not in operation on the weekends, when Madame
Defarge is too busy at her restaurant.)

In Chapters 6 through 12, we built a
complete model of a perfectly com-
petitive economy under a set of
assumptions. By Chapter 12, we had
demonstrated that the allocation of
resources under perfect competition
is efficient and we began to relax
some of the assumptions on which
the perfectly competitive model is
based. We introduced the idea of
market failure, and in Chapters 13,
14, and 15, we talked about three
kinds of imperfect markets: monop-
oly, oligopoly, and monopolistic com-
petition. We also discussed some of the ways government has responded to the inefficiencies of
imperfect markets and to the development of market power.
As we continue our examination of market failure, we look first at externalities as a source of
inefficiency. Often when we engage in transactions or make economic decisions, second or third
parties suffer consequences that decision makers have no incentive to consider. For example,
for many years, manufacturing firms and power plants had no reason to worry about the impact
of smoke from their operations on the quality of the air we breathe. Now we know that air
pollution—an externality—harms people.
Next, we consider a second type of market failure that involves products that private firms
find unprofitable to produce even if members of society want them. These products are called
public goods or social goods. Public goods yield collective benefits, and in most societies, govern-
ments produce them or arrange to provide them. The process of choosing what social goods to
produce is very different from the process of private choice.
Finally, while the existence of externalities and public goods are examples of market failure,
it is not necessarily true that government involvement always improves matters. Just as markets
fail, so too can governments. When we look at the incentives facing government decision makers,
we find several reasons behind government failure.
Externalities and Environmental Economics
An externality exists when the actions or decisions of one person or group impose a cost or
bestow a benefit on second or third parties. Externalities are sometimes called spillovers or
neighborhood effects. Inefficient decisions result when decision makers fail to consider social costs
and benefits.
The presence of externalities is a significant phenomenon in modern life. Examples are
everywhere: Air, water, land, sight, and sound pollution; traffic congestion; automobile acci-
dents; abandoned housing; nuclear accidents; and secondhand cigarette smoke are only a few.
For most of the spring and summer of 2010, people watched as the oil spill from BP’s disastrous
well explosion spread throughout the Gulf. The study of externalities is a major concern of
environmental economics.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
The growth of China and India has put increased pressure on the environment. As new
countries industrialize, strains on global air and water systems are inevitable. Problems of exter-
nalities have increasingly become global problems.
Marginal Social Cost and Marginal-Cost Pricing
In the absence of externalities, when a firm weighs price and marginal cost to decide output, it
is weighing the full benefits to society of additional production against the full costs to society
of that production. Those who benefit from the production of a product are the people or
households who end up consuming it. The price of a product is a good measure of what an
additional unit of that product is “worth” because those who value it more highly already buy
it. People who value it less than the current price are not buying it. If marginal cost includes all
costs—that is, all costs to society—of producing a marginal unit of a good, additional produc-
tion will be efficient, provided P is greater than MC. Up to the point where P = MC, each unit
of production yields benefits in excess of cost. Figure 16.1(a) shows a firm and an industry in
which no externalities exist.
Suppose, however, that the production of the firm’s product imposes external costs on soci-
ety as well. A firm producing detergent may dump wastewater into a local river as a 
by-product of its detergent production. If the firm does not factor those additional costs into its
decisions, it is likely to overproduce. Figure 16.1(b) shows what happens graphically when we
add in those costs. The curve labeled MSC, marginal social cost, is the sum of the marginal
costs of producing the product and the correctly measured damage costs imposed in the process
of production.
If the firm is allowed to dump its wastewater and does not have to pay for resulting damage
costs, it will produce exactly the same level of output (q*) as before and price (P*) will continue to
reflect only the costs that the firm actually pays to produce its product. The firms in this industry
will continue to produce, and consumers will continue to consume their product, but the market
price of the detergent will not reflect wastewater costs.At equilibrium (q*),marginal social costs are
considerably greater than price. (Recall that price is a measure of the full value to consumers of a
unit of the product at the margin.)
Consider what happens as the detergent plant freely dumps untreated toxic waste into a
river. The waste imposes specific costs on people who live downstream: It kills the fish in the
river, it makes the river ugly to look at and rotten to smell, and it destroys the river for recre-
ational use. There may also be health hazards depending on what chemicals the firm is dump-
ing. Obviously, the plant’s product provides certain benefits. Its soap is valuable to consumers
who are willing and able to pay for it. The firm employs people and capital. The issue is how
the net benefits produced by the plant compare with the damage that it does. You do not need
an economic model to know that someone should consider the costs of those damages.
Acid Rain and the Clean Air Act
Acid rain is an excellent example of an externality
and of the issues and conflicts involved in dealing with externalities. When manufacturing
firms and power plants in the Midwest burn coal with a high sulfur content, smoke from
those plants mixes with moisture in the atmosphere. The result is a dilute acid that is wind-
blown north to Canada and east to New York and New England, where it falls to Earth as rain.
How does the acid rain problem look to the different parties involved? For manufacturing
firms and public utilities generating the sulfur dioxide that creates acid rain, burning high-
sulfur coal delivers cheap power and employment to residents of the Midwest. Paying to clean up
the damage or changing the fuel mix to reduce sulfur would result in higher electricity prices.
Some firms would likely go out of business, and jobs would be lost. For residents in other parts of
the United States and Canada, particularly those near wildlife areas, the burning of high-sulfur
coal and the resulting acid rain results in fish kills and deforestation. Often these citizens are far
enough away from the power plants producing the sulfur dioxide that they are not even benefit-
ing from the cheaper power. As in many areas of economics, the hard issue here is how to balance
benefits to one set of claimants with costs to another.
In complex cases of externalities, like acid rain, often governments get involved. The United
States began its work in reducing acid rain with the Clean Air Act in 1990. Since then, the United

If we assume that the current

external costs without weighing
them in their decisions are likely
to produce too much. At q*,
marginal social cost exceeds the
price paid by consumers.
States has made substantial progress in reducing the problem of acid rain, and many acidified
lakes and streams now once again support fish life. Recently, the United States has employed an
innovative “cap and trade” program to control emissions, which we will discuss later in this chap-
ter. For acid rain, which travels across national boundaries, agreements between Canada and the
United States have also played an important role.
Other Externalities
Clearly, the most significant and hotly debated issue of externalities is
global warming. The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to former Vice President Al Gore and
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 2,500 researchers from 130 nations
that issued a number of reports linking human activity to the recent rise of the average tempera-
ture on Earth. Although there is considerable disagreement, many people are convinced that
strong measures must be taken to prevent major adverse consequences such as dramatically ris-
ing sea levels. We will return to this topic later.
Individual actions can also create externalities. When I drive during rush hour, I increase
congestion faced by other drivers. If I smoke, your health may be compromised. Again the key
issue is weighing the costs and benefits to all parties.
Some Examples of Positive Externalities
Thus far we have described a series of neg-
ative externalities. But externalities can also be positive. In some cases, when other people or
firms engage in an activity, there are side benefits from that activity. From an economics perspec-
tive, there are problems with positive externalities as well.

332
PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Ian Ayres and Steve Levitt have studied a fascinating example of a product with positive
externalities, LoJack. LoJack is a device that allows police to track a car when it is stolen. When a
car has a LoJack device installed, the gains to stealing that car are sharply reduced. These devices
not only help recover cars but also help catch car thieves. Suppose that 90 percent of the cars in a
community had LoJack installed. If all LoJack cars were identified—the way houses are that have
burglar alarms—potential thieves could look for the unmarked cars. As it happens, LoJack does
not come with any identifying mark. From a thief’s perspective, any car has a 90 percent chance
of having a LoJack installed. As a result, the benefits from stealing any car are reduced. With
reduced benefits, fewer thefts occur. Ayres and Levitt have found that the size of these positive
externalities are very large; they estimate that the purchaser of a LoJack captures, as an individual,
only 10 percent of the value of the device.1
We also see positive externalities in the case of vaccinations. The more people who are vacci-
nated, the less likely a disease will become prevalent. But the less likely the disease, the lower the
private benefits to people from getting a vaccination. With communicable diseases, health precau-
tions taken by an individual have positive external benefits to the rest of the community.
The problem with positive externalities should now be clear. For this type of externality, the
individuals in charge have too little incentive to engage in the activity. Too few LoJacks are
bought; too few people wash their hands often; too few people would vaccinate their children
unless forced to do so by school systems.

Lojack,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 108, (1), 1998.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Ban on Oil Drillers
In April 2010, one of BP’s deep water wells exploded, killing 10 peo-
ple and creating what would become one of the largest environmen-
tal disasters in the United States. The article below describes what
was known about the damage by the summer of 2010.
The effect of this disaster on economic and environmental
policy is likely to also be substantial. Oil still provides a substan-
tial portion of U.S. energy, and many of the oil reserves lie off-
shore. The recent disaster has made some of the trade-offs
between environmental security and energy security consider-
ably more salient.
New Ban Hits Oil Drillers
The Wall Street Journal
WASHINGTON—The Obama administration on Monday
issued a new order banning most new deepwater-drilling
activities until Nov. 30, setting up a fresh round of conflict with
the oil industry over when it will be safe to drill again offshore.
The latest round in the clash over the ban on new drilling
got under way as BP installed a new cap on its blown-out
undersea well that company and government officials hope
will capture all the spewing oil. BP officials have said they
are also aiming to finish drilling a relief well that will allow
them to permanently stanch the flow. Even after the well is
sealed, BP and the Gulf Coast face a lengthy process of
cleaning up the huge slick that has fouled beaches and
wetlands from Texas to Florida.
In moving to reinstate the drilling ban, President
Barack Obama again sided with environmental groups
and many voters in big coastal states such as Florida and
California who support a halt to new deepwater drilling
until the causes of the catastrophic BP PLC well blowout
are known.
“We know that that is not without some economic conse-
quences to the region,” White House Press Secretary Robert
Gibbs said Monday. “But it's imperative that we have a sense
of what happened before we continue to do this again.”
But public officials and many residents of Gulf states
directly affected by the spill say the ban threatens thousands
of jobs in the offshore oil industry.

Private Choices and External Effects
To help us understand externalities and to see how one might make trade-offs in the situations we
have described, let us use a simple two-person example. Harry lives in a dormitory at a big public
college in the Southwest, where he is a first-year student. Harry is a serious gamer, with a partic-
ular fondness for “Call of Duty,” a popular but noisy game. Unfortunately, the walls of Harry’s
dorm are made of quarter-inch drywall over 3-inch aluminum studs. You can hear people sleep-
ing four rooms away. Because of a hearing loss after an accident on the Fourth of July some years
ago, Harry often does not notice the volume of his game. Jake, who lives next door to Harry, is a
pre-med student trying hard to steer clear of video games.
Let us assume that there are no further external costs or benefits to anyone other than Harry
and Jake from Harry’s play. Figure 16.2 illustrates the decision process that the two dorm resi-
dents face. The downward-sloping curve labeled MB represents the value of the marginal benefits
that Harry derives from gaming. Of course, Harry does not sit down to draw this curve, any more
than anyone else (other than an economics student) sits down to draw actual demand curves.
Curves like this are simply abstract representations of the way people behave. If you think about
it, such a curve must exist. To ask how much an hour of gaming is worth to you is to ask how
much you would be willing to pay to have it. Start at $0.01 and raise the “price” slowly in your
mind. Presumably, you must stop at some point. Where you stop depends on your taste for games
and your income.
You can think about the benefits Harry derives from gaming as the maximum amount of
money that he would be willing to pay for an hour of play. For the first hour, for instance, the
value for MB is $0.50. We assume diminishing marginal utility, of course. The more hours
Harry plays, the lower the additional benefits from each successive hour. As the graph shows,
the MB curve falls below $0.05 per hour after 8 hours of playing.
We call the cost that Harry must pay for each additional hour of gaming the marginal
private cost, labeled MPC in Figure 16.2. In the present example, this cost is primarily the cost of
electricity. This cost is constant at $0.05 per hour.
Then there is Jake. Although Harry’s gaming does not poison Jake, give him lung cancer, or
even cause him to lose money, it damages him nonetheless: He gets a headache, loses sleep, and
cannot concentrate on his work. Jake is harmed, and it is possible (at least conceptually) to mea-
sure that harm in terms of the maximum amount that he would be willing to pay to avoid it. The
damage, or cost, imposed on Jake is represented in Figure 16.2 by the curve labeled MDC.
Formally, marginal damage cost (MDC) is the additional harm done by increasing the level of
an externality-producing activity by 1 unit. By assuming Jake would be willing to pay some
amount of money to avoid the noise, it is reasonable to assume the amount increases each succes-
sive hour. His headache gets worse with each additional hour he is forced to listen.

The marginal benefits to Harry
exceed the marginal costs he
must bear to play his game
system for a period of up to
8 hours. When the noise of the
game occurs, a cost is being
imposed on Jake. When we add
the costs borne by Harry to the
damage costs imposed on Jake,
we get the full cost of the game
play to the two-person society
made up of Harry and Jake.
Playing more than 5 hours is
inefficient because the benefits
to Harry are less than the social
cost for every hour above 5. If
Harry considers only his private
costs, he will play for too long a
time from society’s point of view.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
In the simple society of Jake and Harry,it is easy to add up social benefits and costs.At every level
of output (playing time),total social cost is the sum of the private costs borne by Harry and the dam-
age costs borne by Jake. In Figure 16.2, MPC (constant at $0.05 per hour) is added to MDC to get
MSC. The social optimum occurs where the marginal social benefit equals the marginal social cost.
Now consider what would happen if Harry simply ignored Jake.2 If Harry decides to continue
gaming, Jake will be damaged. As long as Harry gains more in personal benefits from an additional
hour of play than he incurs in costs, the system will stay on. He will play it for 8 hours (the point
where Harry’s MB = MPC). This result is inefficient; for every hour of play beyond 5, the marginal
social cost borne by society—in this case, a society made up of Harry and Jake—exceeds the mar-
ginal benefits to Harry—that is, MSC > Harry’s MB. It is generally true that when economic deci-
sions ignore external costs, whether those costs are borne by one person or by society, those
decisions are likely to be inefficient. We will return to Harry and Jake to see how they deal with their
problem. First, we need to discuss the general problem of correcting for externalities.
Internalizing Externalities
A number of mechanisms are available to provide decision makers with incentives to weigh the
external costs and benefits of their decisions, a process called internalization. In some cases, exter-
nalities are internalized through bargaining and negotiation without government involvement. In
other cases, private bargains fail and the only alternative may be government action of some kind.
Five approaches have been taken to solving the problem of externalities: (1) private bargain-
ing and negotiation, (2) legal rules and procedures, (3) government-imposed taxes and subsidies,
(4) sale or auctioning of rights to impose externalities, and (5) direct government regulation.
While each is best suited for a different set of circumstances, all five provide decision makers with
an incentive to weigh the external effects of their decisions.
Private Bargaining and Negotiation
Return to Harry and Jake. Most of you have likely
been in this situation at one time or another.For most people in this situation,the first step is obvious:
Knock on Harry’s door and ask him to turn down the volume or reduce his play time during your
study hours. In fact, good manners are a societal reaction to incipient externalities. As societies
increase in population density, more and more activities fall under the category of “not done in
public.” Consider what has happened over time to the social acceptability of smoking, for exam-
ple. In 2010, in anticipation of its Expo, the Chinese government cracked down on the tendency
of its citizens in Shanghai to wear their pajamas outside the home, believing that this dress has
negative externalities for their international guests.
Even when there are no social norms against an activity, private bargains and negotiation can
often solve an externality problem. The formal model describing how private negotiations work
was described first by Ronald Coase, in 1960.3 Indeed the Coase theoremdescribing the process
by which individual actions can solve externalities without government is a staple topic in both
law and economics classes around the world.
To see how the Coase theorem works,let us return to Jake and Harry’s dorm rooms.Suppose Jake
has been unsuccessful in his mannerly plea to Harry.What next? At this point one might want to know
what the rules are. Indeed, Coase tells us that, while it does not matter what the rules are in situations
like this, it is very important that there be rules that are known to all parties. Negotiations are difficult
when the two parties don’t agree on who has what rights.Let us assume,at least at first,that in this col-
lege, there are no rules against video games and everyone in the dorm is aware of this lenient policy.
Harry can play his games as much as he likes, which we see from Figure 16.2 is 8 hours a day. In a sys-
tem with no rules and an unmannerly neighbor, does Jake have any recourse?
Look back at Figure 16.2 and put yourself in Jake’s position. With Harry playing his game 
8 hours a day, the value of the last hour of play to Harry is pretty small. In fact, as you see at the
eighth hour, playing is worth only $0.05 per hour. After 8 hours of listening to the sounds of bat-
tle, however, Jake is going wild. He would pay more than $0.25 per hour for some relief. There is
room for a deal! As Harry cuts back on play, the value of the marginal hour of play goes up, and
the marginal damage to Jake of listening begins to fall. For hours of play in excess of 5, Jake’s
2 It may be easier for individuals to ignore the social costs imposed by their actions when those costs fall on large numbers of
other people whom they do not have to look in the eye or they do not know personally. For the moment, however, we assume
that Harry takes no account of Jake.
Coase theorem
Under
certain conditions, when
externalities are present,
private parties can arrive at the
efficient solution without
government involvement.
3 See Ronald Coase,“The Problem of Social Cost,” Journal of Law and Economics, 1960.

CHAPTER 16
Externalities, Public Goods, and Social Choice 335
incremental damage exceeds Harry’s incremental value of playing. Again, look back at Figure 16.2.
As Coase would tell us, for all hours greater than 5 per day, Jake realizes enough benefits from
silence to be able to bribe Harry into being quiet. Notice, however, what happens at 5 hours of
play per day. To cut back below 5 hours per day, Harry’s marginal benefit from play rises to above
$0.25 per hour. Electricity costs him $0.05 per hour. So to make him stop, Jake would have to
bribe him with at least $0.20. But as the graph shows, at less than 5 hours per day, Jake’s damage
per hour is less than $0.20. Five hours is the efficient playing time. More hours or fewer hours
reduce total benefits to Harry and Jake.
Coase tells us that under certain conditions, private negotiations will push society to the right
level of output evenwith externalities.What features of the Harry–Jake situation matter for this type
of solution to work? First, as noted, the basic rights must be understood by all parties. In this situa-
tion Jake knows he has to bribe Harry because Harry has the right to make noise if he wants to. If
rights are not spelled out, arguments about who has what right interfere with the bargaining process.
A second condition is that people must be able to bargain without impediment or costs.The fact that
Jake and Harry lived next to each other made the bargaining a lot easier. Finally, private negotiation
works best when the number of parties involved is few in number. If one party to a bargain is a large
group, such as all residents of a town or an area as in the earlier acid rain example, private negotia-
tions work less well.
Coase also pointed out that bargaining will bring the contending parties to the right solution
regardless of where rights are initially assigned. Suppose that the dorm rules state that Jake has the
right to silence. This being the case, Jake can go to the dorm administrators and have them enforce
the rule. Now when Harry plays the game and Jake asks him to turn it off, Harry must comply.Now
the tables are turned. Accepting the dorm rules (as he must), Harry knocks on Jake’s door. Jake’s
damages from the first hour are only $0.15. This means that if Jake was compensated by more
than $0.15, he would allow the gaming. Now the stage is set for bargaining. Harry gets $0.45 in
net benefit from the first hour of playing ($0.50 minus private cost of $0.05). Thus, he is willing
to pay up to $0.45 for the privilege. If there are no impediments to bargaining, money will
change hands. Harry will pay Jake some amount between $0.15 and $0.45, and just as before,
gaming will continue. Jake has, in effect, sold his right to have silence to Harry. As before, bar-
gaining between the two parties will lead to 5 hours of gaming. At exactly 5 hours, Jake will stop
taking compensation and tell Harry to turn the system off. (Look again at Figure 16.2 to see that
this is true.)
In both cases, the offer of compensation might be made in some form other than cash. Jake
may offer Harry goodwill, a favor or two, or the use of his Harley-Davidson for an hour. Indeed,
in this example, if Harry has the right to play as much as he wants (our Case 1), Jake may offer to buy
Harry a headset that allows him to game quietly. Jake’s willingness to do this would, of course,
depend on how much a headset costs and how long Jake expected to live next door to Harry.
Coase’s critics are quick to point out that the conditions required for bargaining to produce
the efficient result are not always present. The biggest problem with Coase’s system is also a com-
mon problem.Very often one party to a bargain is a large group of people, and our reasoning may
be subject to a fallacy of composition.
Suppose a power company in Pittsburgh is polluting the air. The damaged parties are the
100,000 people who live near the plant. Let us assume the plant has the right to pollute. The
Coase theorem predicts that the people who are damaged by the smoke will get together and
offer a bribe (as Jake offered a bribe to Harry). If the bribe is sufficient to induce the power plant
to stop polluting or reduce the pollutants with air scrubbers, it will accept the bribe and cut
down on the pollution. If the bribe is not sufficient, the pollution will continue, but the firm will
have weighed all the costs (just as Harry did when he continued to play the game) and the result
will be efficient.
However, not everyone will contribute to the bribe fund. First, each contribution is so
small relative to the whole that no single contribution makes much of a difference. Making a
contribution may seem unimportant or unnecessary to some. Second, all people get to breathe
the cleaner air whether they contribute to the bribe or not. Many people will not participate
simply because they are not compelled to, and the private bargain breaks down—the bribe that
the group comes up with will be less than the full damages unless everyone participates. (We
discuss these two problems—the drop-in-the-bucket and the free-rider—later in this chapter.)
When the number of damaged parties is large, government taxes or regulation may be the only
avenue to a remedy.

336
PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Legal Rules and Procedures
As we have just seen, for bargaining to result in an efficient
outcome, the initial assignment of rights must be clear to both parties. When rights are estab-
lished by law, more often than not some mechanism to protect those rights is also built into the
law. In some cases where a nuisance exists, for example, there may be legal remedies. In such
cases, the victim can go to court and ask for an injunction that forbids the damage-producing
behavior from continuing. If the dorm rules specifically give Jake the right to silence, Jake’s get-
ting the resident adviser to speak to Harry is something like getting an injunction.
Injunctive remedies are irrelevant when the damage has already been done. Consider acci-
dents. If your leg has already been broken as the result of an automobile accident, enjoining the
driver of the other car from drinking and driving will not work—it is too late. In these cases,
rights must be protected by liability rules, rules that require A to compensate B for damages
imposed. In theory, such rules are designed to do the same thing that taxing a polluter is designed
to do: provide decision makers with an incentive to weigh all the consequences, actual and
potential, of their decisions. Just as taxes do not stop all pollution, liability rules do not stop all
accidents.
However, the threat of liability actions does induce people to take more care than they might
otherwise. Product liability is a good example. If a person is damaged in some way because a
product is defective, the producing company is, in most cases, held liable for the damages, even if
the company took reasonable care in producing the product. Producers have a powerful incentive
to be careful. If consumers know they will be generously compensated for any damages, however,
they may not have as powerful an incentive to be careful when using the product.
Taxes and Subsidies
When private negotiations fail, economists have traditionally advo-
cated marginal taxes and subsidies as a direct way of forcing firms to consider external costs or
benefits. When a firm imposes an external social cost, the reasoning goes, a per-unit tax should be
imposed equal to the damages of each successive unit of output produced by the firm—the tax
should be exactly equal to marginal damage costs.4
Figure 16.3 repeats Figure 16.1(b), but this time the damage costs are paid by the firm in the
form of a per-unit tax—that is, the tax = MDC. The firm now faces a marginal cost curve that is
the same as the marginal social cost curve (MC1 = MSC). Remember that the industry supply
curve is the sum of the marginal cost curves of the individual firms. This means that as a result of
the tax, the industry supply curve shifts to the left, driving up price from P0 to P1. The efficient
level of output is q1, where P = MC1. (Recall our general equilibrium analysis from Chapter 12.)

4 As we discuss later in this chapter, damage costs are difficult to measure. It is often assumed that they are proportional to the
volume of pollutants discharged into the air or water. Instead of taxes, governments often impose effluent charges, which make
the cost to polluters proportional to the amount of pollution caused. We will use “tax” to refer to both taxes and effluent charges.

If a per-unit tax exactly equal to
marginal damage costs is
imposed on a firm, the firm will
weigh the tax, and thus the dam-
age costs, in its decisions. At the
new equilibrium price, P1, con-
sumers will be paying an amount
sufficient to cover full resource
costs as well as the cost of dam-
age imposed. The efficient level
of output for the firm is q1.

CHAPTER 16
Externalities, Public Goods, and Social Choice 337
Because a profit-maximizing firm equates price with marginal cost, the new price to con-
sumers covers the resource costs of producing the product and the damage costs. The consumer
decision process is once again efficient at the margin because marginal social benefit as reflected
in market price is equal to the full social marginal cost of the product.
An interesting example of the use of taxes to reduce pollution is the tax that London has
placed on cars driving into the central part of the city. New York’s Mayor Bloomberg considered
a similar policy.
Measuring Damages
The biggest problem with using taxes and subsidies is that damages
must be estimated in financial terms. For the detergent plant polluting the nearby river to be
properly taxed, the government must evaluate the damages done to residents downstream in
money terms. This evaluation is difficult but not impossible. When legal remedies are pursued,
judges are forced to make such estimates as they decide on compensation to be paid. Surveys of
“willingness to pay,” studies of property values in affected versus nonaffected areas, and some-
times the market value of recreational activities can provide basic data.
The monetary value of damages to health and loss of life is, naturally, more difficult to esti-
mate, and any measurement of such losses is controversial. Even here, policy makers frequently
make judgments that implicitly set values on life and health. Tens of thousands of deaths and mil-
lions of serious injuries result from traffic accidents in the United States every year, yet Americans
are unwilling to give up driving or to reduce the speed limit to 40 miles per hour—the costs of
either course of action would be too high. If most Americans are willing to increase the risk of
death in exchange for shorter driving times, the value we place on life has its limits.
Keep in mind that taxing externality-producing activities may not eliminate damages. Taxes
on these activities are not designed to eliminate externalities; they are simply meant to force deci-
sion makers to consider the full costs of their decisions. Even if we assume that a tax correctly
measures all the damage done, the decision maker may find it advantageous to continue causing
the damage. The detergent manufacturer may find it most profitable to pay the tax and go on pol-
luting the river. It can continue to pollute because the revenues from selling its product are suffi-
cient to cover the cost of resources used and to compensate the damaged parties fully. In such a
case, producing the product in spite of the pollution is “worth it” to society. It would be ineffi-
cient for the firm to stop polluting. In our earlier example, the optimal level of Harry’s gaming
was 5 hours per day, not 0. Only if damage costs were very high would it make sense to have no
pollution. Thus, you can see the importance of proper measurement of damage costs.
Reducing Damages to an Efficient Level
Taxes also provide firms with an incentive to use
the most efficient technology for dealing with damage. If a tax reflects true damages and it is
reduced when damages are reduced, firms may choose to avoid or reduce the tax by using a dif-
ferent technology that causes less damage. Suppose our soap manufacturer is taxed $10,000 per
month for polluting the river. If the soap plant can ship its waste to a disposal site elsewhere at a
cost of $7,000 per month and thereby avoid the tax, it will do so. If a plant belching sulfides into
the air can install smoke scrubbers that eliminate emissions for an amount less than the tax
imposed for polluting the air, it will do so.
The Incentive to Take Care and to Avoid Harm
You should understand that all externali-
ties involve at least two parties and that it is not always clear which party is “causing” the dam-
age. Take our friends Harry and Jake. Harry enjoys games; Jake enjoys quiet. If Harry plays, he
imposes a cost on Jake. If Jake can force Harry to stop, he imposes a cost on Harry.
Often, the best solution to an externality problem may not involve stopping the externality-
generating activity. Suppose Jake and Harry’s dormitory has a third resident, Pete. Pete hates
silence. The resident adviser on Harry’s floor arranges for Pete and Jake to switch rooms. What
was once an external cost has been transformed into an external benefit. Everyone is better off.
Harry and Pete get to listen to sounds of war, and Jake gets his silence.
Sometimes the most efficient solution to an externality problem is for the damaged party to
avoid the damage. However, if full compensation is paid by the damager, damaged parties may have
no incentive to do so. Consider a laundry located next to the exhaust fans from the kitchen of a
Chinese restaurant. Suppose damages run to $1,000 per month because the laundry must use spe-
cial air filters in its dryers so that the clothes will not smell of Szechuan spices. The laundry looks
around and finds a perfectly good alternative location away from the restaurant that rents for only
$500 per month above its current rent.Without any compensation from the Chinese restaurant, the

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Externalities Are All Around Us
Externalities arise from many sources. The most common examples
involve smoking factories and the automobile. But externalities are
everywhere. Here are two examples of externalities that you may
have experienced.
THE CRYING BABY
Peter Scott, once employed as a research assistant on this book and
now a writer in Hollywood, wrote the following lines about crying
babies on airplanes:
“The best example of this [an externality] is on airplanes. For
most of my life, a crying baby on an airplane felt like some kind of
torture method used to get spies to reveal national secrets. There was
actually a deleted scene in Goldfinger where Goldfinger locks James
Bond in a room with crying babies. The problem was that Bond then
shot himself, thus destroying the franchise. So they rewrote the scene
and had Goldfinger try and slice Bond in half with a laser. Bond
could easily escape from that because lasers are obviously less terri-
fying than crying babies.”1
John Tierney wrote about the same externality in the New York
Times:2 “If you think of a screaming child as an environmental dis-
turbance, then giving a child a discount is like offering subsidy to a
polluter. A child should at least pay full fare, and the fairest policy
would be to impose a surcharge.”

Jim McDilda’s holiday display last year included a 28-foot
lighted arch, 50-foot tree, 50,000 lights, and dozens of ani-
mated silhouettes. The spectacle—he needed a crane to
set it all up—lit up the sky and drew thousands of gawking
visitors to his Redding, Calif., house.
But nearby neighbors weren’t so thrilled. Cars, limos,
and tour buses clogged the cul-de-sac, and trash was
strewn across lawns. Christmas music blasting from 
Mr. McDilda’s display kept neighbors awake. They com-
plained to the city, which required that Mr. McDilda get a
special-events permit and demanded that he remove the
nearby cargo containers he used to store the display most
of the year. After months of sniping between Mr. McDilda
and the city, he decided to throw in the towel. This year, his
house is unadorned.

laundry will move and the total damage will be the $500 per month extra rent that it must pay. But
if the restaurant compensates the laundry for damages of $1,000 a month, why should the laundry
move? Under these conditions, a move is unlikely even though it would be efficient.
Subsidizing External Benefits
Sometimes activities or decisions generate external benefits
instead of costs, as in the case of Harry and Pete, or in the LoJack example. Real estate investment
provides another example. Investors who revitalize a downtown area—an old theater district in a
big city, for example—provide benefits to many people, both in the city and in surrounding areas.
Activities that provide such external social benefits may be subsidized at the margin to give
decision makers an incentive to consider them. Just as ignoring social costs can lead to inefficient
decisions, so too can ignoring social benefits. Government subsidies for housing and other devel-
opment, either directly through specific expenditure programs or indirectly through tax exemp-
tions, have been justified on such grounds.
Selling or Auctioning Pollution Rights
We have already established that not all
externality-generating activities should be banned. Around the world, the private automobile has
become the clearest example of an externality-generating activity whose benefits (many believe)
outweigh its costs.

CHAPTER 16
Externalities, Public Goods, and Social Choice 339
Many externalities are imposed when we drive our cars. First, congestion is an externality.
Even though the marginal “harm” imposed by any one driver is small, the sum total is a serious
cost to all who spend hours in traffic jams. Second, most of the air pollution in the United States
comes from automobiles. The problem is most evident in Los Angeles, where smog loaded with
harmful emissions (mostly from cars) blankets the city virtually every day. Finally, driving
increases the likelihood of accidents, raising insurance costs to all.
While we do not ignore these costs from the standpoint of public policy, we certainly have
not banned driving. Athens, Greece, however, has instituted an even-odd system in which inner
city driving is restricted to alternative days depending on a person’s license plate number. (In a
development that some economists predicted, however, this rule has led some people to buy two
cars and simply switch off.) In many cases, we have also consciously opted to allow ocean dump-
ing, river pollution, and air pollution within limits.
The right to impose environmental externalities is beneficial to the parties causing the
damage. In a sense, the right to dump in a river or to pollute the air or the ocean is a resource.
Thinking of the privilege to dump in this way suggests an alternative mechanism for control-
ling pollution: selling or auctioning the pollution rights to the highest bidder. The Clean Air
Act of 1990 takes this cap-and-trade approach to controlling the emissions from our nation’s
power plants. Emissions from each plant are capped; that is, emissions are limited to a specified
level. The lower the level specified, the more air quality will improve. The plant is issued a per-
mit allowing it to emit only at that level. This permit can be used or can be traded to another
firm in what has developed into a large auction market. For a firm with low costs of abating
pollution, it is often in the firm’s best interest to cut back below its permit levels and sell its
unused permits to a firm with higher abatement costs. In this way, the given level of emissions
chosen by the government will be achieved at the lowest possible costs as a result of market
trades. Environmentalists can also buy up permits and leave them unused, resulting in
improvements in air quality beyond what the government mandated. These cap-and-trade
programs are being used around the world in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gases responsi-
ble for global warming.
A simple example will help illustrate the potential gains from a cap-and-trade system.
Table 16.1 shows the situation facing two firms, both of which are polluting. Assume that each
firm emits 5 units of pollution and the government wants to reduce the total amount of pollution
from the current level of 10 to 4. To do this, the government caps each firm’s allowed pollution
level at 2. Thus, each firm must pay to cut its pollution levels by 3 units. The process of reducing
pollution is sometimes called pollution abatement. The table shows the marginal cost of abate-
ment for each firm and the total costs. For Firm A, for example, the first unit of pollution reduced
or abated costs only $5. As the firm tries to abate more pollution, doing so becomes more diffi-
cult; the marginal costs of reducing pollution rise. If Firm A wants to reduce its pollution levels
from 5 units to 2, as the government requires, it must spend $21, $5 for the first unit, $7 for the
second unit, and $9 for the third unit. Firm B finds reducing pollution to be more difficult. If it
tries to reduce pollution by 3 units, it will have costs of $45. A cap-and-trade policy gives each of
these firms two permits and allows them to trade permits if they so choose. What will the firms
want to do?
Firm A can reduce its emissions from 2 units to 1 unit by spending $12 more on abate-
ment. It would then have a permit to sell to Firm B. How much would Firm B be willing to pay
for this permit? At the moment, the firm is abating 3 units, and the marginal cost of that third

unit is $23. This tells us that Firm B would be willing to pay up to $23 to buy a permit to allow
it to continue polluting up to a level of 3. So there is room for a deal. Indeed, the permit price
will be somewhere between the $12 demanded by Firm A and the $23 that Firm B is willing to
spend. Because Firm A’s marginal costs of abatement are lower than Firm B’s, we expect
Firm A to do more abatement and sell its extra permit to B. You should be able to see from the
numbers that Firm A will not sell its last permit to B. To abate another unit, Firm A would
have marginal costs of $17. To avoid abatement, however, Firm B would pay only $14. There is
no room for a deal. Once the trade of one permit by A to B has occurred, there are still only
4 units of pollution, but now Firm A is emitting 1 unit and Firm B is emitting 3 units. What
are the total costs of this pollution reduction? When both firms were reducing their emission
levels equally, the total costs were $21 for Firm A and $45 for Firm B, for a total of $66. Now
costs are $33 for A and $22 for B, for a total of $55. (Of course, A will also be receiving a pay-
ment for the permit.)
Europe took the problem of global warming seriously by implementing the world’s first
mandatory trading scheme for carbon dioxide emissions in 2005. Carbon dioxide emissions
are a major source of global warming. The first phase of the plan, which was over at the end of
2007, involved around 12,000 factories and other facilities. The participating firms were oil
refineries; power generation facilities; and glass, steel, ceramics, lime, paper, and chemical fac-
tories. These 12,000 plants represented 45 percent of total European Union (EU) emissions.
The EU set an absolute cap on carbon dioxide emissions and then allocated allowances to gov-
ernments. The nations in turn distributed the allowances to the separate plants. In the second
phase from 2008 through 2012, a number of large sectors will be added, including agriculture
and petrochemicals.
In both the United States and Europe, the allowances are given out to the selected plants
free of charge even though the allowances will trade at a high price once they are distributed.
Many are now questioning whether the government should sell them in the market or collect a
fee from the firms. As it is, many of the firms that receive the allocations get a huge windfall.
During the second phase in Europe, the governments are allowed to auction over 10 percent of
the allowances issued.
Another example of selling externality rights comes from Singapore, where the right to buy a
car is auctioned each year. Despite very high taxes and the need for permits to drive in downtown
areas, the roads in Singapore have become congested. The government decided to limit the num-
ber of new cars on the road because the external costs associated with them (congestion and pol-
lution) were becoming very high. With these limits imposed, the decision was made to distribute
car ownership rights to those who place the highest value on them. It seems likely that taxi drivers,
trucking companies, bus lines, and traveling salespeople will buy the licenses; families who drive
for convenience instead of taking public transportation will find the licenses too expensive.
Congestion and pollution are not the only externalities that Singapore takes seriously: In 2005 the
fine for littering was as high as $1,000; for failing to flush a public toilet, over $100; and for eating
on a subway, $300.
Direct Regulation of Externalities
Taxes, subsidies, legal rules, and public auctions are
all methods of indirect regulation designed to induce firms and households to weigh the social
costs of their actions against their benefits. The actual size of the external cost/benefit depends on
the reaction of households and firms to the incentives provided by the taxes, subsidies, and rules.
For obvious reasons, many externalities are too important to be regulated indirectly.
Dumping cancer-causing chemicals into the ground near a public water supply is simply illegal,
and those who do it can be prosecuted and sent to jail.
Direct regulation of externalities takes place at federal, state, and local levels. The
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a federal agency established by an act of Congress in
1970. Since the 1960s, Congress has passed a great deal of legislation that sets specific standards for
permissible discharges into the air and water. Every state has a division or department charged
with regulating activities that are likely to harm the environment. Most airports in the United
States have landing patterns and hours that are regulated by local governments to minimize noise.
Many criminal penalties and sanctions for violating environmental regulations are like the
taxes imposed on polluters. Not all violations and crimes are stopped, but violators and criminals
face “costs.” For the outcome to be efficient, the penalties they expect to pay should reflect the
damage that their actions impose on society.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Climate Change
Global warming has become one of the most difficult environmen-
tal policy challenges of our time. The science is complex, the effects
are long lasting, the nations involved are many, and the costs and
benefits to different nations are highly varied. Island nations in areas
that are already warm will experience very different effects from
landlocked colder nations. Substantial reductions of greenhouse
gases are likely to be very expensive. For all these reasons, inter-
national accord has been hard to achieve. In December 2010 the
international community tried again with a set of meetings in
Cancun, Mexico. The article below describes a meeting of the develop-
ing nations (and leading up to the Cancun meeting) that took place in
May 2010 in China. The article illustrates some of the complex inter-
national issues in the global warming debate.
China, India Doubt Climate Deal Is Near
The Wall Street Journal
BEIJING—Top climate-change officials from China and India
expressed pessimism at a Beijing conference this weekend
about reaching a binding global deal at a United Nations
Climate Summit in Cancun, Mexico, at the end of the year.
China hosted the high profile global-warming forum that
brought together key negotiating blocs in the developing
world, including fellow basic group members Brazil, South
Africa, and India.
Beijing is trying to strengthen its role as leader of the
developing world in climate-change talks after accusations it
sabotaged efforts to reach a binding deal at a U.N.-backed
summit in Copenhagen last December. The composition of
the forum participants served to send “a signal to the world
of the role China wants to play,” said Li Yan, a climate-
change specialist at Greenpeace.
China’s climate-change czar said at the conference that a
binding pact on tackling global warming remains out of
reach until several big issues are settled, including how to
handle $100 billion in funds for developing nations to rein in
greenhouse gases over the next decade.
The Beijing meeting didn’t result in any conclusive state-
ment, but it aimed to provide a channel to promote larger
climate-change talks, said former Chinese Vice Premier
Zeng Peiyan, who was in charge of the conference.
Analysts say Beijing also wanted to use the conference to
send a strong signal to the nation’s local governments that it
is serious about reaching energy-efficiency targets.
Such a signal is especially urgent after news that China’s
infrastructure and housing-led economic recovery increased
the country’s energy intensity 3.2% in the first quarter com-
pared with a year earlier, reversing a steady decline in the
amount of energy used to produce each dollar of gross
domestic product.
China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases in
absolute terms, has said it would cut energy intensity 20% by
the end of this year, a goal that is closely tied to the country’s
pledge to reduce its carbon intensity—the amount of carbon
emitted per dollar of GDP—by 40% to 45% by 2020.

Public (Social) Goods
Another source of market failure lies in public goods, often called social or collective goods.
Public goods are defined by two closely related characteristics: They are nonrival in consumption,
and/or their benefits are nonexcludable. As we will see, these goods represent a market failure
because they have characteristics that make it difficult for the private sector to produce them
profitably. In an unregulated market economy with no government to see that they are produced,
public goods would at best be produced in insufficient quantity and at worst not produced at all.
The Characteristics of Public Goods
A good is nonrival in consumption when A’s consumption of it does not interfere with B’s con-
sumption of it. This means that the benefits of the goods are collective—they accrue to everyone.
National defense, for instance, benefits us all. The fact that I am protected in no way detracts from
public goods (social or
collective goods)

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
the fact that you are protected; every citizen is protected just as much as every other citizen. If the
air is cleaned up, my breathing that air does not interfere with your breathing it, and (under ordi-
nary circumstances) that air is not used up as more people breathe it. Private goods, in contrast,
are rival in consumption. If I eat a hamburger, you cannot eat it too.
Goods can sometimes generate collective benefits and still be rival in consumption. This
happens when crowding occurs. A park or a pool can accommodate many people at the same
time, generating collective benefits for everyone. However, when too many people crowd in on a
hot day, they begin to interfere with each other’s enjoyment.
Most public goods are also nonexcludable. Once the good is produced, people cannot be
excluded for any reason from enjoying its benefits. Once a national defense system is established,
it protects everyone.
Before we go on, it is very important to note that goods are either public or private by virtue
of their characteristics (nonrival and nonexcludable) and not by virtue of whether they are pro-
duced by the public sector. If the government decided to make it a law that hamburgers were an
entitlement (that is, all people could have all the hamburgers they wanted at government
expense), that decision would not make hamburgers into public goods. It is an example of the
government’s providing a private good free of charge to all. The government’s decision not to
exercise the power to exclude doesn’t change the nature of a hamburger.
The real problem with public goods is that private producers may simply not have any incentive
to produce them or to produce the right amount.For a private profit-making firm to produce a good
and make a profit, it must be able to withhold that good from those who do not pay. McDonald’s can
make money selling chicken sandwiches only because customers do not get the chicken sandwich
unless they pay for it first. If payment were voluntary, McDonald’s would not be in business for long.
Consider an entrepreneur who decides to offer better police protection to the city of
Metropolis. Careful (and we assume correct) market research reveals that the citizens of Metropolis
want high-quality protection and are willing to pay for it. Not everyone is willing to pay the same
amount. Some can afford more, others less. People also have different preferences and different feel-
ings about risk. Our entrepreneur hires a sales force and begins to sell his service. Soon he encoun-
ters a problem. Because his company is private, payment is voluntary. He cannot force anyone to
pay. Payment for a hamburger is voluntary too, but a hamburger can be withheld for nonpayment.
The good that our new firm is selling, however, is by nature a public good.
As a potential consumer of a public good, you face a dilemma. You want more police protec-
tion, and let us say that you are even willing to pay $50 a month for it. But nothing is contingent
on your payment. First, if the good is produced, the crime rate falls and all residents benefit. You
get that benefit whether or not you pay for it. You get a free ride. That is why this dilemma is
called the free-rider problem. Second, your payment is very small relative to the amount that
must be collected to provide the service. Thus, the amount of police protection actually produced
will not be significantly affected by how much you contribute or whether you contribute at all.
This is the drop-in-the-bucket problem. Consumers acting in their own self-interest have no
incentive to contribute voluntarily to the production of public goods. Some will feel a moral
responsibility or social pressure to contribute, and those people indeed may do so. Nevertheless,
the economic incentive is missing, and most people do not find room in their budgets for many
voluntary payments. The public goods problem can also be thought of as a large-number, prison-
ers’ dilemma game theory problem. (For a full discussion, see Chapter 14.)
Public Provision of Public Goods
All societies, past and present, have had to face the problem of providing public goods. When mem-
bers of society get together to form a government, they do so to provide themselves with goods and
services that will not be provided if they act separately. Like any other good or service, a body of laws
(or system of justice) is produced with labor,capital,and other inputs.Law and the courts yield social
benefits, and they must be set up and administered by some sort of collective, cooperative effort.
Notice that we are talking about public provision, not public production. Once the government
decides what service it wants to provide,it often contracts with the private sector to produce the good.
Much of the material for national defense is produced by private defense contractors. Highways, gov-
ernment offices, data processing services, and so on, are usually produced by private firms.
One of the immediate problems of public provision is that it frequently leads to public dis-
satisfaction. It is easy to be angry at government. Part, but certainly not all, of the reason for this
dissatisfaction lies in the nature of the goods that government provides. Firms that produce or sell

private goods post a price—we can choose to buy any quantity we want, or we can walk away with
nothing. It makes no sense to get angry at a shoe store because no one can force you to shop there.
You cannot shop for collectively beneficial public goods.When it comes to national defense,the
government must choose one and only one kind and quantity of (collective) output to produce.
Because none of us can choose how much should be spent or what it should be spent on, we are all
dissatisfied. Even if the government does its job with reasonable efficiency, at any given time, about
half of us think we have too much national defense and about half of us think we have too little.
Optimal Provision of Public Goods
In the early 1950s, economist Paul Samuelson, building on the work of Richard Musgrave,
demonstrated that there exists an optimal, or a most efficient, level of output for every public
good.5 The discussion of the Samuelson and Musgrave solution that follows leads us straight to
the thorny problem of how societies, as opposed to individuals, make choices.
The Samuelson–Musgrave Theory
An efficient economy produces what people want.
Private producers, whether perfect competitors or monopolists, are constrained by the market
demand for their products. If they cannot sell their products for more than it costs to produce
them, they will be out of business. Because private goods permit exclusion, firms can withhold
their products until households pay. Buying a product at a posted price reveals that it is “worth”
at least that amount to you and to everyone who buys it.
Market demand for a private good is the sum of the quantities that each household decides
to buy (as measured on the horizontal axis) at each price. The diagrams in Figure 16.4 review the
derivation of a market demand curve. Assume that society consists of two people, A and B. At a
price of $1, A demands 9 units of the private good and B demands 13. Market demand at a price
of $1 is 22 units. If price were to rise to $3, A’s quantity demanded would drop to 2 units and B’s
would drop to 9 units; market demand at a price of $3 is 2 + 9 = 11 units. The point is that the
price mechanism forces people to reveal what they want, and it forces firms to produce only what
people are willing to pay for, but it works this way only because exclusion is possible.
People’s preferences and demands for public goods are conceptually no different from their
preferences and demands for private goods.You may want fire protection and be willing to pay for
it in the same way you want to listen to a CD. To demonstrate that an efficient level of production
exists, Samuelson assumes that we know people’s preferences. Figure 16.5 shows demand curves

Economy,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 53 (2), 213-237, February 1938.

At a price of $3, A buys 2 units and B buys 9 for a total of 11. At a price of $1, A buys 9 units and B buys 13

sum of all individual demand curves.

for buyers A and B. If the public good were available in the private market at a price of $6, A would
buy X1 units. Put another way, A is willing to pay $6 per unit to obtain X1 units of the public good.
B is willing to pay only $3 per unit to obtain X1 units of the public good.
Remember, public goods are nonrival and/or nonexcludable—benefits accrue simultane-
ously to everyone. One and only one quantity can be produced, and that is the amount that
everyone gets. When X1 units are produced, A gets X1 and B gets X1. When X2 units are produced,
A gets X2 and B gets X2.
To arrive at market demand for public goods, we do not sum quantities. Instead, we add
the amounts that individual households are willing to pay for each potential level of output.
In Figure 16.5, A is willing to pay $6 per unit for X1 units and B is willing to pay $3 per unit
for X1 units. Thus, if society consists only of A and B, society is willing to pay $9 per unit for 
X1 units of public good X. For X2 units of output, society is willing to pay a total of $4 per unit.
For private goods, market demand is the horizontal sum of individual demand curves—we
add the different quantities that households consume (as measured on the horizontal axis). For
public goods, market demand is the vertical sum of individual demand curves—we add the dif-
ferent amounts that households are willing to pay to obtain each level of output (as measured on
the vertical axis).

B—is willing to pay a total of $9
for X1 units of the good. Because
only one level of output can be
chosen for a public good, we
must add A’s contribution to B’s
to determine market demand.
This means adding demand
curves vertically.

CHAPTER 16    Externalities, Public Goods, and Social Choice 345
Samuelson argued that once we know how much society is willing to pay for a public good,
we need only compare that amount to the cost of its production. Figure 16.6 reproduces A’s and
B’s demand curves and the total demand curve for the public good. As long as society (in this
case, A and B) is willing to pay more than the marginal cost of production, the good should be
produced. If A is willing to pay $6 per unit of public good and B is willing to pay $3 per unit, soci-
ety is willing to pay $9.
Given the MC curve as drawn in Figure 16.6, the efficient level of output is X1 units. If at that
level A is charged a fee of $6 per unit of X produced and B is charged a fee of $3 per unit of X,
everyone should be happy. Resources are being drawn from the production of other goods and
services only to the extent that people want the public good and are willing to pay for it. We have
arrived at the optimal level of provision for public goods. At the optimal level, society’s total
willingness to pay per unit is equal to the marginal cost of producing the good.
The Problems of Optimal Provision
One major problem exists, however. To produce
the optimal amount of each public good, the government must know something that it cannot
possibly know—everyone’s preferences. Because exclusion is impossible, nothing forces house-
holds to reveal their preferences. Furthermore, if we ask households directly about their willing-
ness to pay, we run up against the same problem encountered by our protection-services
salesperson mentioned earlier. If your actual payment depends on your answer, you have an
incentive to hide your true feelings. Knowing that you cannot be excluded from enjoying the ben-
efits of the good and that your payment is not likely to have an appreciable influence on the level
of output finally produced, what incentive do you have to tell the truth—or to contribute?
How does society decide which public goods to provide? We assume that members of society
want certain public goods. Private producers in the market cannot make a profit by producing these
goods, and the government cannot obtain enough information to measure society’s demands accu-
rately. No two societies have dealt with this dilemma in the same way. In some countries, dictators
simply decide for the people. In other countries, representative political bodies speak for the people’s
preferences. In still other countries, people vote directly. None of these solutions works perfectly. We
will return to the problem of social choice at the end of the chapter.
Local Provision of Public Goods: Tiebout Hypothesis
In 1956, economist Charles Tiebout made this point: To the extent that local governments are
responsible for providing public goods, an efficient market-choice mechanism may exist. Consider
a set of towns that are identical except for police protection. Towns that choose to spend a great
deal of money on police are likely to have a lower crime rate. A lower crime rate will attract house-
holds who are risk-averse and who are willing to pay higher taxes for a lower risk of being a crime
victim. Those who are willing to bear greater risk may choose to live in the low-tax/high-crime

towns. Also, if some town is efficient at crime prevention, it will attract residents—given that each
town has limited space, property values will be bid up in this town. The higher home price in this
town is the “price” of the lower crime rate.
According to the Tiebout hypothesis, an efficient mix of public goods is produced when
local prices (in the form of taxes or higher housing costs) come to reflect consumer preferences
just as they do in the market for private goods. What is different in the Tiebout world is that peo-
ple exercise consumer sovereignty not by “buying” different combinations of goods in a market,
but by “voting with their feet” (choosing among bundles of public goods and tax rates produced
by different towns and participating in local government).
Social Choice
One view of government, or the public sector, holds that it exists to provide things that “society
wants.” A society is a collection of individuals, and each has a unique set of preferences. Defining
what society wants, therefore, becomes a problem of social choice—of somehow adding up, or
aggregating, individual preferences.
It is also important to understand that government is made up of individuals—politicians
and government workers—whose own objectives in part determine what government does. To
understand government, we must understand the incentives facing politicians and public ser-
vants, as well as the difficulties of aggregating the preferences of the members of a society.
The Voting Paradox
Democratic societies use ballot procedures to determine aggregate preferences and to make the
social decisions that follow from them. If all votes could be unanimous, efficient decisions would
be guaranteed. Unfortunately, unanimity is virtually impossible to achieve when hundreds of
millions of people, with their own different preferences, are involved.
The most common social decision-making mechanism is majority rule, but it is not perfect. In
1951, economist Kenneth Arrow proved the impossibility theorem6—that it is impossible to devise
a voting system that respects individual preferences and gives consistent, nonarbitrary results.
One example of a seemingly irrational result emerging from majority-rule voting is the vot-
ing paradox. Suppose that faced with a decision about the future of the institution, the president
of a major university opts to let its top three administrators vote on the following options: Should
the university (A) increase the number of students and hire more faculty, (B) maintain the cur-
rent size of the faculty and student body, or (C) cut back on faculty and reduce the student body?
Figure 16.7 represents the preferences of the three administrators diagrammatically.
The vice president for finance (VP1) wants growth, preferring A to B and B to C. The vice
president for development (VP2), however, does not want to rock the boat, preferring the main-
tenance of the current size of the institution, option B, to either of the others. If the status quo is
out of the question, VP2 would prefer option C. The dean believes in change, wanting to shake
the place up and not caring whether that means an increase or a decrease. The dean prefers C to
A and A to B.

Table 16.2 shows the results of the vote. When the three vote on A versus B, they vote in favor
of A—to increase the size of the university instead of keeping it the same size. VP1 and the dean
outvote VP2. Voting on B and C produces a victory for option B; two of the three would prefer to
hold the line than to decrease the size of the institution. After two votes, we have the result that A
(an increase) is preferred to B (no change) and that B (no change) is preferred to C (a decrease).

The problem arises when we have the three vote on A against C. Both VP2 and the dean vote
for C, giving it the victory; C is actually preferred to A. Nevertheless, if A beats B and B beats C,
how can C beat A? The results are inconsistent.
The voting paradox illustrates several points. Most important is that when preferences for
public goods differ among individuals, any system for adding up, or aggregating, those prefer-
ences can lead to inconsistencies. In addition, it illustrates just how much influence the person
who sets the agenda has. If a vote had been taken on A and C first, the first two votes might never
have occurred. This is why rules committees in both houses of Congress have enormous power;
they establish the rules under which, as well as the order in which, legislation will be considered.
Another problem with majority-rule voting is that it leads to logrolling. Logrolling occurs
when representatives trade votes—D helps get a majority in favor of E’s program; in exchange, E
helps D get a majority on D’s program. It is not clear whether any bill could get through any leg-
islature without logrolling. It is also not clear whether logrolling is, on balance, a good thing or a
bad thing from the standpoint of efficiency. On the one hand, a program that benefits one region
or group of people might generate enormous net social gains, but because the group of beneficia-
ries is fairly small, it will not command a majority of delegates. If another bill that is likely to gen-
erate large benefits to another area is also awaiting a vote, a trade of support between the two
sponsors of the bills should result in the passage of two good pieces of efficient legislation. On the
other hand, logrolling can also turn out unjustified, inefficient pork barrel legislation.
A number of other problems also follow from voting as a mechanism for public choice. For
one, voters do not have much of an incentive to become well informed. When you go out to buy
a car or, on a smaller scale, an MP3 player, you are the one who suffers the full consequences of a
bad choice. Similarly, you are the beneficiary of the gains from a good choice. This is not so in
voting. Although many of us believe that we have a civic responsibility to vote, no one really
believes that his or her vote will actually determine the outcome of an election. The time and
effort it takes just to get to the polls are enough to deter many people. Becoming informed
involves even more costs, and it is not surprising that many people do not do it.
Beyond the fact that a single vote is not likely to be decisive is the fact that the costs and benefits
of wise and unwise social choices are widely shared. If the congressperson whom you elect makes a
big mistake and wastes a billion dollars, you bear only a small fraction of that cost. Even though the
sums involved are large in aggregate, individual voters find little incentive to become informed.
Two additional problems with voting are that choices are almost always limited to bundles of pub-
licly provided goods and that we vote infrequently.Many of us vote for Republicans or Democrats.We
vote for president only every 4 years.We elect senators for 6-year terms.In private markets,we can look
at each item separately and decide how much of each item we want.We also can shop daily.In the pub-
lic sector,though,we vote for a platform or a party that takes a particular position on a whole range of
issues. In the public sector it is very difficult, or impossible, for voters to unbundle issues.
There is, of course, a reason why bundling occurs in the sphere of public choice. It is difficult
enough to convince people to go to the polls once a year. If we voted separately on every appropri-
ation bill, we would spend our lives at the polls. This is one reason for representative democracy.
We elect officials who we hope will become informed and represent our interests and preferences.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Government Inefficiency: Theory of Public Choice
Recent work in economics has focused not just on the government as an extension of individual
preferences but also on government officials as people with their own agendas and objectives.
That is, government officials are assumed to maximize their own utility, not the social good. To
understand the way government functions, we need to look less at the preferences of individual
members of society and more at the incentive structures that exist around public officials.
The officials whom we seem to worry about are the people who run government agencies—
the Social Security Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and
state registries of motor vehicles, for example. What incentive do these people have to produce a
good product and to be efficient? Might such incentives be lacking?
In the private sector, where firms compete for profits, only efficient firms producing goods that
consumers will buy survive. If a firm is inefficient—if it is producing at a higher-than-necessary
cost—the market will drive it out of business. This is not necessarily so in the public sector. If a
government bureau is producing a necessary service or one that is mandated by law, it does not
need to worry about customers. No matter how bad the service is at the registry of motor vehi-
cles, everyone with a car must buy its product.
The efficiency of a government agency’s internal structure depends on the way incentives
facing workers and agency heads are structured. If the budget allocation of an agency is based on
the last period’s spending alone, for example, agency heads have a clear incentive to spend more
money, however inefficiently. This point is not lost on government officials, who have experi-
mented with many ways of rewarding agency heads and employees for cost-saving suggestions.
However,critics say such efforts to reward productivity and punish inefficiency are rarely success-
ful. It is difficult to punish, let alone dismiss, a government employee. Elected officials are subject to
recall,but it usually takes gross negligence to rouse voters into instituting such a measure.Also,elected
officials are rarely associated with problems of bureaucratic mismanagement, which they decry daily.
Critics of “the bureaucracy” argue that no set of internal incentives can ever match the disci-
pline of the market. They point to studies of private versus public garbage collection, airline
operations, fire protection, mail service, and so on, all of which suggest significantly lower costs
in the private sector. One theme of the Reagan and first Bush administrations was “privatization.”
If the private sector can possibly provide a service, it is likely to do so more efficiently—so the
public sector should allow the private sector to take over.
One concern regarding wholesale privatization is the potential effect it may have on distrib-
ution. Late in his administration, President Reagan suggested that the federal government sell its
entire stock of public housing to the private sector. Would the private sector continue to provide
housing to poor people? The worry is that it would not because it may not be profitable to do so.
Like voters, public officials suffer from a lack of incentive to become fully informed and to make
tough choices. Consider an elected official. If the real objective of an elected official is to get reelected,
then the real incentive must be to provide visible goods for that official’s constituency while hiding the
costs or spreading them thin.Self-interest may easily lead to poor decisions and public irresponsibility.
Looking at the public sector from the standpoint of the behavior of public officials and the poten-
tial for inefficient choices and bureaucratic waste rather than in terms of its potential for improving
the allocation of resources has become quite popular. This is the viewpoint of what is called the public
choice field in economics that builds heavily on the work of Nobel laureate James Buchanan.
Rent-Seeking Revisited
Another problem with public choice is that special-interest groups can and do spend resources to
influence the legislative process. As we said before, individual voters have little incentive to
become well informed and to participate fully in the legislative process. Favor-seeking special-
interest groups have a great deal of incentive to participate in political decision making. We saw
in Chapter 13 that a monopolist would be willing to pay to prevent competition from eroding its
economic profits. Many—if not all—industries lobby for favorable treatment, softer regulation,
or antitrust exemption. This, as you recall, is rent-seeking.
Rent-seeking extends far beyond those industries that lobby for government help in preserving
monopoly powers. Any group that benefits from a government policy has an incentive to use its
resources to lobby for that policy.Farmers lobby for farm subsidies,oil producers lobby for oil import
taxes, and the American Association of Retired Persons lobbies against cuts in Social Security.
In the absence of well-informed and active voters, special-interest groups assume an
important and perhaps critical role. But there is another side to this story. Some have argued

CHAPTER 16
Externalities, Public Goods, and Social Choice 349
that favorable legislation is, in effect, for sale in the marketplace. Those willing and able to pay the
most are more successful in accomplishing their goals than those with fewer resources. Theory may
suggest that unregulated markets fail to produce an efficient allocation of resources. This should not
lead you to the conclusion that government involvement necessarily leads to efficiency. There are
reasons to believe that government attempts to produce the right goods and services in the right
quantities efficiently may fail.
Government and the Market
There is no question that government must be involved in both the provision of public goods and the
control of externalities. No society has ever existed in which citizens did not get together to protect
themselves from the abuses of an unrestrained market and to provide for themselves certain goods
and services that the market did not provide. The question is not whether we need government
involvement. The question is how much and what kind of government involvement we should have.
Critics of government involvement correctly say that the existence of an “optimal” level of
public-goods production does not guarantee that governments will achieve it. It is easy to show
that governments will generally fail to achieve the most efficient level. There is no reason to
believe that governments are capable of achieving the “correct” amount of control over external-
ities. Markets may fail to produce an efficient allocation of resources, but governments may make
it worse. Measurement of social damages and benefits is difficult and imprecise. For example,
estimates of the costs of acid rain range from practically nothing to incalculably high amounts.
Just as critics of government involvement must concede that the market by itself fails to
achieve full efficiency, defenders of government involvement must acknowledge government’s
failures. Many on both sides agree that we get closer to an efficient allocation of resources by try-
ing to control externalities and by doing our best to produce the public goods that people want
with the imperfect tools we have than we would by leaving everything to the market.
S U M M A R Y
EXTERNALITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL
ECONOMICS p. 329
1. Often when we engage in transactions or make economic deci-
sions, second or third parties suffer consequences that decision
makers have no incentive to consider. These are called
externalities. A classic example of an external cost is pollution.
2. When external costs are not considered in economic deci-
sions, we may engage in activities or produce products that
are not “worth it.” When external benefits are not consid-
ered, we may fail to do things that are indeed “worth it.” The
result is an inefficient allocation of resources.
3. A number of alternative mechanisms have been used to control
externalities: (1) government-imposed taxes and subsidies, (2)
private bargaining and negotiation, (3) legal remedies such as
injunctions and liability rules, (4) sale or auctioning of rights to
impose externalities, and (5) direct regulation.
PUBLIC (SOCIAL) GOODS p. 341
4. In an unfettered market, certain goods and services that peo-
ple want will not be produced in adequate amounts. These
public goods have characteristics that make it difficult or
impossible for the private sector to produce them profitably.
5. Public goods are nonrival in consumption (their benefits fall
collectively on members of society or on groups of mem-
bers), and/or their benefits are nonexcludable (it is generally
impossible to exclude people who have not paid from enjoy-
ing the benefits of public goods). An example of a public
good is national defense.
6. One of the problems of public provision is that it leads to
public dissatisfaction. We can choose any quantity of private
goods that we want, or we can walk away without buying
any. When it comes to public goods such as national defense,
the government must choose one and only one kind and
quantity of (collective) output to produce.
7. Theoretically, there exists an optimal level of provision for
each public good. At this level, society’s willingness to pay
per unit equals the marginal cost of producing the good. To
discover such a level, we would need to know the preferences
of each individual citizen.
8. According to the Tiebout hypothesis, an efficient mix of pub-
lic goods is produced when local land/housing prices and
taxes come to reflect consumer preferences just as they do in
the market for private goods.
SOCIAL CHOICE p. 346
9. Because we cannot know everyone’s preferences about pub-
lic goods, we are forced to rely on imperfect social choice
mechanisms such as majority rule.
10. The theory that unfettered markets do not achieve an effi-
cient allocation of resources should not lead us to conclude
that government involvement necessarily leads to efficiency.
Governments also fail.
GOVERNMENT AND THE MARKET p. 349
11. Defenders of government involvement in the economy
acknowledge its failures but believe we get closer to an effi-
cient allocation of resources with government than without
it. By trying to control externalities and by doing our best to
provide the public goods that society wants, we do better
than we would if we left everything to the market.

1. If government imposes on the firms in a polluting industry
penalties (taxes) that exceed the actual value of the damages
done by the pollution, the result is an inefficient and unfair
imposition of costs on those firms and on the consumers of
their products. Discuss that statement. Use a graph to show how
consumers are harmed.
2. It has been proposed that toll collection on the Massachusetts
Turnpike, a key commuter route into Boston from the west, be
discontinued. Proponents argue that tolls have long ago paid for
the cost of building the road; now they just provide cash for a
fat bureaucracy. A number of economists are opposing the
repeal of tolls on the grounds that they serve to internalize
externalities. Explain their argument briefly.
3. Many people are concerned with the problem of urban sprawl.
As the development of new housing tracts and suburban shop-
ping malls continues over time, metropolitan areas have become
more congested and polluted. Open space disappears, and the
quality of life changes. Think of your own metropolitan area,
city, or town. Using the concept of externalities, consider the
issue of land use and development. What are the specific deci-
sions made in the development process that lead to externali-
ties? On whom are the externalities imposed? Do you think that
they are measurable? In what specific ways can decision makers
be given the incentive to consider them? One of the cities that
has paid the most attention to urban sprawl is Portland,
Oregon. Search the Web to see what you can find out about
Portland’s approach.
4. The existence of “public goods” is an example of potential mar-
ket failure and suggests that a government or public sector can
improve the outcome of completely free markets. Write a brief
summary of the arguments for government provision of public
goods. (Make sure you consider the discussion of a prisoners’
dilemma in the last chapter.) The following three arguments
suggest that government may not improve the outcome as much
as we might anticipate.
a. Public goods theory: Because public goods are collective, the
government is constrained to pick a single level of output
for all of us. National defense is an example. The govern-
ment must pick one level of defense expenditure. Some will
think it is too much, some will think it is too little, and no
one is happy.
b. Problems of social choice: It is impossible to choose collec-
tively in a rational way that satisfies voters/consumers of
public goods.
c. Public choice and public officials: Once elected or appointed,
public officials tend to act in accordance with their own
preferences and not out of concern for the public.
5. Which of the three arguments do you find to be most persuasive?
5. It has been argued that the following are examples of “mixed
goods.” They are essentially private but partly public. For each
example, describe the private and public components and dis-
cuss briefly why the government should or should not be
involved in their provision.
a. Elementary and secondary education
b. Higher education
c. Medical care
d. Air traffic control
6. A paper factory dumps polluting chemicals into the Snake River.
Thousands of citizens live along the river, and they bring suit,
claiming damages. You are asked by the judge to testify at the
trial as an impartial expert. The court is considering four possi-
ble solutions, and you are asked to comment on the potential
efficiency and equity of each. Your testimony should be brief.
a. Deny the merits of the case and affirm the polluter’s right to
dump. The parties will achieve the optimal solution without
government.
b. Find in favor of the plaintiff. The polluters will be held liable
for damages and must fully compensate citizens for all past
and future damages imposed.
c. Order an immediate end to the dumping, with no damages
awarded.
d. Refer the matter to the Environmental Protection Agency,
which will impose a tax on the factory equal to the mar-
ginal damage costs. Proceeds will not be paid to the dam-
aged parties.
7. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 338] The
Economics in Practice suggests that children impose negative
externalities. What does that imply about discounts for chil-
dren’s meals at restaurants and discount tickets for children at
museums? Provide three examples of activities that may, in fact,
generate positive externalities.

8. Explain why you agree or disagree with each of the following
statements:
a. The government should be involved in providing housing
for the poor because housing is a “public good.”
b. From the standpoint of economic efficiency, an unregulated
market economy tends to overproduce public goods.
9. Society is made up of two individuals, A and B, whose demands
for public good X are given in Figure 1. Assuming that the pub-
lic good can be produced at a constant marginal cost of $6,
what is the optimal level of output? How much would you
charge A and B?
10. Government involvement in general scientific research has been
justified on the grounds that advances in knowledge are public
goods—once produced, information can be shared at virtually
no cost. A new production technology in an industry could be
made available to all firms, reducing costs of production, dri-
ving down price, and benefiting the public. The patent system,
however, allows private producers of “new knowledge” to
exclude others from enjoying the benefits of that knowledge.
Inventors would have little incentive to produce new knowledge
if there was no possibility of profiting from their inventions. If
one company holds exclusive rights to an advanced production
process, it produces at lower cost but can use the exclusion to
acquire monopoly power and hold price up.
a. On balance, is the patent system a good or bad thing?
Explain.
b. Is government involvement in scientific research a good
idea? Discuss.
11. The Coase theorem implies that we never need to worry
about regulating externalities because the private individuals
involved will reach the efficient outcome through negotia-
tions. Is that statement true or false? Justify your answer and
use examples.
12. The recent economic growth resulting from government poli-
cies of newly industrializing nations such as India and China
has increased environmental strains on global air and water sys-
tems. The negative externalities associated with this economic
growth demonstrate that the best economic system is one in
which all economic decisions are made by individual house-
holds and firms without any government involvement.
Comment briefly.
13. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 341] The
United Nations Climate Change Conference was scheduled to
be held in Cancun, Mexico, from November 29–December 10,

ference. Write a brief essay on any binding deals concerning
global warming which were reached at the conference. If no
deals were reached, discuss which nations prevented any
binding resolutions and what issues stood in the way of
reaching these deals.
14. The following diagram represents the profit-maximizing
price and output for a firm in a perfectly competitive indus-
try with no externalities. Use this diagram to explain what

16. Suppose the nation of Valencia must decide which project to
fund: public transportation, construction of a seaport, or a

Dean is willing to pay Sammy $125 if he will stop playing the
drums at home. Sammy offers Dean $75 per week to find some
place else to read. If Dean has the right to read in silence,
explain why the condo will be free of drum playing. If Sammy
has the right to play his drums, explain why the condo will still
be free of drum playing.

17. Two firms, Cappcore and Tradiola, are each emitting 6 units of
pollution, and the government wants to reduce the total level of
pollution from the current level of 12 to 4. To do this, the gov-
ernment caps each firm’s allowed pollution level at 2. Each firm
must now pay to cut pollution levels by 4 units. A cap-and-trade
policy gives each of these firms two permits and allows them to
trade permits if they choose. Based on the table below which
represents the situation faced by these two firms, what will the
firms want to do?

Labor Market Incentives
In previous chapters, we assumed
that consumers and firms made
choices based on perfect informa-
tion. When consumers choose
between two products, we assume
that they know the qualities of
those products, and as a result their
choices reveal their true prefer-
ences. Similarly, when firms choose
how many workers to hire or how
much capital to use, we assume that
they know the productivity of
those workers or that capital. Of
course, in many settings, perfect
information seems to be a reason-
able assumption to make. Every day
you may choose whether to have
cereal or eggs for breakfast. Every
evening you may decide what to
have for dinner and whether to go
to the movies or stay home and
study. Even for these choices, a little
uncertainty can creep in; perhaps a
new cereal is on the market or a new movie has been released. But assuming that these choices are
made with perfect information does not seem too far a stretch.
In some markets, however, consumers and firms clearly make decisions with quite limited
information. When you decide to insure your car against theft, you don’t know whether the car
will be stolen. When you decide to buy a used car, it is not easy to figure out how good that car
really is. If you are choosing between a sales job that pays a flat salary and one that pays a commis-
sion for every sale you make, you have to predict how good your sales skills will be to determine
which is the better offer. In many markets, including some very important markets, consumers as
well as firms make decisions while having only some of the information they need. In this chap-
ter, we will explore the economics of these markets. As we go through this chapter, you will see
how both the recent health care reform discussion and the 2008–2009 banking crisis can be
understood using economic tools.
Decision Making Under Uncertainty: 
The Tools
In Chapter 6, we laid out the fundamental principles of consumer choice assuming perfect infor-
mation. To adapt this model to cases in which there is uncertainty, we need to develop a few
more tools.

Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Expected Value
Suppose I offer you the following deal:You flip a coin 100 times.Every time the coin is a head,you pay
me $1.Whenever the coin lands on tails,I pay you a dollar.We call the amount that one player—in this
case, me—receives in each of the situations the payoff. Here my payoff is +$1 for heads and –$1 for
tails.In the case of a coin toss,the probability of heads is 1⁄2,as is the probability of tails.This tells us that
the financial value of this deal to me, or its expected value, is $0. Half the time I win a dollar, and half
the time I lose a dollar. Formally, we define the expected value of an uncertain situation or deal as the
sum of the payoffs associated with each possible outcome multiplied by the probability that outcome
will occur.Again, in the case of a coin toss with the payoffs described, the expected value (EV) is
EV = 1/2 ($1) + 1/2 (–$1) = 0
The coin toss is an easy example, in part because there are only two outcomes. But the defin-
ition of expected value holds for any deal in which I can describe both the payoffs and the proba-
bilities of all possible outcomes. If I play a game in which I receive $1 every time I roll a die and
end up with an even number and I pay $1 every time the die comes up odd, this deal also has an
expected value of $0. Half the time (3 of 6 possible outcomes) I receive $1, and half the time (3 of
6 possible outcomes) I pay $1.
The two games just described are known as fair games or fair bets. A fair game has an
expected value of $0. The expected financial gains from playing a fair game are equal to the finan-
cial costs of that game. In the two fair games we described, the stakes are quite low. Suppose
instead of $1 payoffs, we made the payoffs $1,000 for heads and –$1,000 for tails. As you can see,
the expected value of that deal is $0 just as it was in the $1 game. But we have learned in watching
people’s behavior that while some people might be willing to play a fair game with $1 payoffs,
very few people will play $1,000-payoff fair games. What is it about people that makes them
change their minds about taking a fair bet when the stakes get high? We will explore this question
next using some of the tools already covered in Chapter 6.
Expected Utility
Recall from Chapter 6 that consumers make choices to maximize utility. The idea of maximizing util-
ity will also help us understand the way in which those consumers make choices in risky situations.
Chapter 6 introduced you to the idea of diminishing marginal utility—the more of any one
good consumed in a period, the less incremental satisfaction (utility) will be generated by each
additional (marginal) unit of that good. Review Figure 6.3 on p. 127 and notice the form the util-
ity curve takes when we have diminishing marginal utility for a good. The curve flattens as we
increase units of the good consumed. Now think about what happens to your utility level when
we increase not the number of units of a particular good, but your overall income. Figure 17.1
graphs the total utility of a typical consumer, Jacob, as a function of his income. On the Y-axis, we
have assigned units of total utility, while on the X-axis we have annual income. The shape of the
utility curve tells us that Jacob has diminishing marginal utility from income. The first $20,000 of
income is very important to Jacob, moving him from a total utility level of 0 to 10; this first
$20,000 might allow him to buy food and shelter, for example. Moving from $20,000 to $40,000
brings an increase in well-being from 10 to 15. Notice that the second $20,000 adds 5 to the total
utility level, while the first $20,000 adds 10. And the pattern continues as we add $20,000 incre-
ments to income. Each dollar increases total utility, but at a decreasing rate. The result is a curve
as shown in Figure 17.1 that flattens as we move from left to right, with smaller gains in total util-
ity from equal gains in income.
You should see that the assumption of diminishing marginal utility of income reflects the dimin-
ishing marginal utility of goods that we talked about in Chapter 6.Income counts for less the more we
have because the value of what we can buy with that money on the margin falls as we buy more.
As you think about Figure 17.1, remember that we are describing the relationship between
utility and income for a given individual. The figure does not tell us that rich people get less util-
ity from an incremental dollar than do poor people. Indeed, it might be argued that one reason
some rich people work so hard to make money is that they get a great deal of utility from
increases in income relative to the average person. But rich or poor, Figure 17.1 tells us that as
your income increases, the marginal utility of another dollar falls.

The figure shows the way in
which utility increases with
income for a hypothetical per-
son, Jacob. Notice that utility
increases with income but at a
decreasing rate: the curve gets
flatter as income increases. This
curve shows diminishing mar-
ginal utility of income.
How does Figure 17.1 help us explain people’s unwillingness to play fair games with larger
stakes? Suppose Jacob, the individual whose preferences are shown in Figure 17.1, is currently
earning $40,000. We see that $40,000 corresponds to a total utility level of 15. Now a firm offers
Jacob a different type of salary structure. Rather than earning $40,000 for sure, at the end of the
year, a manager will toss a coin. If it is heads, Jacob will earn $60,000; but if the coin turns up tails,
his earnings will fall to $20,000. This is a high stakes game of the sort described earlier. Notice
that the expected value of the two salaries is the same. With one, Jacob earns $40,000 with cer-
tainty. With the second, he earns $20,000 half the time and $60,000 half the time, for an expected
value of
EV = 1/2($20,000) + 1/2 (60,000) = $40,000
From an expected value perspective, the two salary offers are identical. So if we simply
looked at the expected values, we might expect Jacob to be indifferent between the two wage
offers. But if you put yourself in Jacob’s shoes, probably you would not find the coin-tossing
salary to be as attractive as the fixed $40,000 wage. If we think back to the model introduced in
Chapter 6, we can see why. Consumers make choices not to maximize income per se but to max-
imize their utility levels. Figure 17.1 tells us that while utility increases with income, the relation-
ship is not linear. So to decide what Jacob will do, we need to look at his utility under the two
contracts.
What can we say about Jacob’s utility under the two salary contracts? With a fixed $40,000
salary, total utility is at a level of 15, as we saw earlier. If his income falls to $20,000, that utility
level falls from 15 to 10, a substantial drop. With a possible earnings level of $60,000, the total
utility level goes up; but notice that it only increases from 15 to only 18. The drop in income
causes a bigger loss in utility than comes from a gain in income. Of course, this results from the
diminishing marginal utility of income. In fact, we can define expected utility as the sum of the
utilities coming from all possible outcomes of a deal, weighted by the probability of each occur-
ring. You can see that the expected utility is like the expected value, but the payoffs are in utility
terms rather than in dollars. In the coin-toss salary offer, if you look again at Figure 17.1, the
expected utility (EU) is
EU = 1/2 U($20,000) + 1/2 U(60,000), which reduces to
EU = 1/2 (10) + 1/2 (18) = 14
Since Jacob’s utility from a fixed salary of $40,000 is 15, he will not take the coin-toss salary
alternative.
Of course, in practice, workers are not paid wages based on the toss of a coin. Nevertheless,
many wage contracts contain some uncertainty. Many of you have probably had jobs where your
wages were uncertain in ways you could not control. Understanding the difference between
expected value maximization and expected utility maximization helps us understand these and
other similar contracts.
In uncertain situations, consumers make choices to maximize their expected utility. Looking
at Figure 17.1, you should now see why people may take small fair bets but will avoid fair games

with high stakes. For small games, people are making choices within a very small region of the
utility curve. The utility of gaining one more dollar or losing it is almost identical. When we com-
pare outcomes at very different points on the utility curve, the differences in marginal utility
become more pronounced. This makes large fair bets quite unattractive.
Attitudes Toward Risk
We have now seen that diminishing marginal utility of income means that the typical individual
will not play a large stakes fair game. Individuals, like Jacob, who prefer a certain payoff to an
uncertain payoff with an equal expected value are called risk-averse. Risk aversion thus comes
from the assumption of diminishing marginal utility of income and can be seen in the shape of
the utility curve. You are unwilling to take a risk because the costs of losing in terms of your well-
being or utility exceed the gains of possibly winning. People who are willing to take a fair bet, one
that has an expected value of zero, are known as risk-neutral. For these individuals, the marginal
utility of income is constant so that the relationship between total utility and income in a graph
like Figure 17.1, for example, would be a straight, upward-sloping line. Again, we have seen that
some people will be risk-neutral when the stakes are low. Finally, some people, in some circum-
stances, may actually prefer uncertain games to certain outcomes. Individuals who pay to play a
game with an expected value of zero or less are known as risk-loving. Since most people are risk-
averse in most situations, we will concentrate on this case.
The fact that people are, in general, risk-averse is seen in many markets. Most people who
own houses buy fire insurance even when not required to do so. In general, a fire insurance
policy costs a homeowner more than it is worth in terms of expected value; this is how insur-
ance companies make money. People pay for this insurance because they are risk-averse: The
possible loss of their home is very important relative to the value of the premiums they have to
pay to protect it. When people invest in a risky business, there has to be some chance that they
will “make it big” to induce them to put up their money. The riskier the business in the sense
that it may fail, the bigger the upside potential needs to be. This too is an indication of risk
aversion.
The presence of risk and uncertainty do not by themselves pose a problem for the workings
of the market. The risk that your house might burn down does not prevent you from buying a
house; it simply encourages you, if you are risk-averse, to buy insurance. In fact, many markets
are designed to allow people to trade risk. Individuals who are risk-averse seek out other individ-
uals (or more commonly firms) who are willing to take on those risks for a price.
The risk premium is the maximum price a risk-averse person will pay to avoid taking a risk.
Figure 17.2 gives us another look at the same individual, Jacob, we examined in Figure 17.1.
Suppose Jacob is currently earning $40,000 but faces a 50 percent chance of suffering an unpre-
ventable disability that will reduce his income level to $0. Thus, the expected value of Jacob’s
income is
EV = .5($40,000) + .5($0) = $20,000
Suppose further that there are many individuals just like Jacob. On average, in any year, half
would become disabled and half would not. If an insurance company offered policies to all of
them, offering to replace their $40,000 salaries should they become disabled, on average, this
policy would cost the company $20,000 per person. In other words, the expected value tells us
what, on average, it would cost a firm that pooled large numbers of identical people to offer
them insurance against an income loss of this size. If the individuals are willing to pay the
insurance company more than this expected value, there is a potential deal to be made. In fact,
looking at Figure 17.2 shows us that the deal offered by the insurance company to cover earn-
ings losses in the case of a disability is worth more than $20,000 to a risk-averse individual like
Jacob. Uninsured, Jacob faces a 50 percent chance of earning $0 and a 50 percent chance of
earning $40,000. Looking at the graph, we see that the expected utility of Jacob in his uninsured
state is
EU = .5 U ($0) + .5 U($40,000)
EU = .5(0) + .5(15) = 7.5

Uncertainty and Asymmetric Information 357
But a utility level of 7.5 corresponds, as we look at Figure 17.2, to a certain income level of x,
which is below the $20,000 level. In other words, Jacob would be indifferent between a certain
income of $x and remaining uninsured. But notice that $x is less than $20,000, which tells us that
Jacob is willing to pay more than $20,000 to avoid this disability risk. So there is room for a deal
between the insurance company and risk-averse individuals. Because insurance companies can
pool risks across many different people, they will be risk-neutral, willing to take on the risks of
individuals for a price. In this example, the distance between $20,000, the expected value of the
risk, and $x tells us the risk premium.
You may now be wondering how economists explain gambling. Every day people
throughout the United States buy lottery tickets even though they know that lotteries are not
a fair bet. The Powerball lottery in Connecticut is one example. The winning number is gen-
erated by choosing 5 numbers out of a pool of 49, then choosing another number from a pool
of 42. The probability of getting all 6 numbers correct and winning the lottery’s top prize is 1
in 80 million. The top prize in the lottery varies but is typically in the $10 million to $150 mil-
lion range. The prize is taxable, and winning the top prize would push a winner into the top
tax bracket with a tax rate of almost 40 percent. When the prize level is very high, many peo-
ple play the lottery and there is a risk of multiple winners, with prize sharing. Thus, in almost
all cases, the expected value of the typical lottery is highly negative. Playing the slots at a
casino also has a negative expected value, as do all professional games of chance. If this were
not true, casinos would go out of business. Nevertheless, individuals buy lottery tickets and
gamble in a range of forms. One explanation for this risk-taking behavior may, of course, be
that some people find gambling fun and gamble not just in the hopes of winning but for the
experience. For other people, gambling may be an addiction. Trying to understand more fully
why people gamble while they seem to be risk-averse in most other ways remains an interest-
ing research area in economics.
Asymmetric Information
In the discussion so far, we have described the way people behave in situations in which everyone
involved in the deal is equally uncertain. Again, the coin toss is a classic case. When you offer me
a coin toss game, neither you nor I know how the coin will fall. It is an unknowable game of
chance. Under these situations, we have seen how to use the idea of expected utility to understand
choices and we have seen how markets arise to enable risk trading. In other situations, though,
the playing field may be less even, with one party to the transaction having more information rel-
evant to the transaction than the other party. Economists refer to these circumstances as ones of
asymmetric information. Asymmetric information creates possibilities of market failure by
making it harder for individuals to make deals that would otherwise be attractive.
We are surrounded by situations with asymmetric information. A homeowner has better
information than does his or her insurance company about how careful his or her family is,
how often family members use candles, and whether anyone smokes. All of these factors are

important to an insurance company trying to set an insurance price. When you applied to
college, you likely knew more about your work ethic than did the colleges to which 
you applied.
In this section, we will explore several classic types of asymmetric situations. We will
look at the nature of the market failure that arises when we have asymmetric information,
and we will consider some of the mechanisms that individuals and markets use to deal with
these problems.
Adverse Selection
A common saying in the car market is that once you drive a new car off the lot, it loses a sub-
stantial part of its original value. Why might this be true? Physical depreciation is likely small
after only a few miles, for example. The answer can be found in the theory of adverse
selection, a theory whose development was cited by the Nobel Committee in its award to
George Akerlof in 2001. Adverse selection is a category of asymmetric information prob-
lems. In adverse selection, the quality of what is being offered in a transaction matters and is
not easily demonstrated. For example, consumers might be willing to pay for high-quality
used cars. But it is hard to tell which cars are good and which cars are not, and sellers will not,
in general, have an incentive to be completely truthful. Insurance companies might be willing
to offer inexpensive health insurance to people who take good care of themselves. But it is not
easy to figure out who those people are, and insurance buyers are not likely to want to tell the
company about their bad habits. As we will see, under these conditions, high-quality products
and high-quality consumers are often squeezed out of markets, giving rise to the term adverse
selection. In the Economics in Practice on page 360, we will explore some issues in adverse selection
and genetic testing. But first we will explore the used car market, the setting Akerlof first
wrote about.
Adverse Selection and Lemons
Suppose you were in the market for a slightly used car
of a particular make, perhaps from 2005. Having read a number of automotive magazines, you
learned that half of these cars are lemons (bad cars) and half are peaches (good cars). Given your
own tastes, a peach of this model year is worth $12,000 to you while a lemon is worth only $3,000.
What would you pay if you were unable to tell a peach from a lemon?
One possible solution to this problem might involve thinking back to the lesson on expected
value. The data we described suggest that the expected value of this type of used car is $7,500,
which we calculate as 1⁄2($12,000) + 1⁄2($3,000). From expected utility theory, you might conclude
that you would pay somewhat less than this—let’s say $7,000.
The problem with this calculation, however, is that you have forgotten that you will be trying
to buy this car from a rational, utility-maximizing car seller. Under these circumstances, it will
not be equally likely that the car offered will be a peach or a lemon. Let us see how a potential
seller of a used car sees the situation.
Suppose you offer current owners of a random 2005 car the $7,000 that we calculated.Which
owners will want to sell? Owners of cars likely know whether they have peaches or lemons. After
all, they have been driving these cars for a while. The game we are playing here is very different
from the coin toss. Owners of the peaches will not, on average, find your offer attractive because
their cars are worth $12,000 and you are offering only $7,000. Owners of lemons, on the other
hand, will leap at the chance of unloading their cars at that price. In fact, with an offer of only
$7,000, only lemon owners will offer their cars for sale. Over time, buyers come to understand
that the probability of getting a lemon on the used market is greater than the probability of get-
ting a peach and the price of the used cars will fall. In fact, in this situation, since you know with
certainty that only lemons will be offered for sale, the most you will offer for the 2005 car is
$3,000, the value to you of a lemon. In the end, Akerlof suggests, only lemons will be left in the
market. Indeed, Akerlof called his paper “The Market for Lemons.”
The used car example highlights the market failure associated with adverse selection.
Because one party to the transaction—the seller here—has better information than the other

party and because people behave opportunistically, owners of high-quality cars will have
difficulty selling them. Buyers who are interested in peaches will find it hard to buy one because
they cannot tell a lemon from a peach and thus are not willing to offer a high enough price to
make the transaction. Thus, while there are buyers who value a peachy car more than it is valued
by its current seller, no transaction will occur. The market, which is normally so good at moving
goods from consumers who place a lower value on a good to consumers with higher values, does
not work properly.
You should now see why the simple act of driving a car off the lot reduces its price dramati-
cally: Potential buyers assume you are selling the car because you must have bought a lemon, and
it is hard for you to prove otherwise.
Adverse Selection and Insurance
Adverse selection is a problem in a number of mar-
kets. Consider the very important market for insurance. We have already seen that risk aversion
causes people to want to buy health insurance. But individuals often know more about their own
health than anyone else, even with required medical exams. For a given premium level, those who
know themselves to be most in need of medical care will be most attracted to the insurance. As
unhealthy people swell the ranks of the insured, premiums will rise. The higher the rates, the less
attractive healthy people will find such insurance. Similar problems are likely in markets for
insurance on auto theft and fire. As with used cars, it will be difficult for insurance companies to
transact business with lower-risk (high-quality) individuals.
Reducing Adverse Selection Problems
In practice, there are a number of ways in
which individuals and markets try to respond to adverse selection problems. Mechanics offer
would-be used car buyers an inspection service that levels the information playing field a bit.
Of course, these inspection services have a price. Buyers can also look for other clues to quality.
Some buyers have come to recognize that the best used cars to buy are from individuals who
have to relocate to another state. Many students buy used cars from graduating seniors for
example. People who need to relocate, like graduating seniors, often want to sell their cars even
if they are peaches, and they may be willing to do so at prices that do not quite reflect what they
know to be the high quality of the car they are selling. If a car is being sold by a dealer, he or she
can offer a warranty that covers repairs for the first few years. The fact that a dealer is willing to
offer a warranty tells the potential buyer that the car is not likely to be a lemon. Dealers also
develop reputations for selling peaches or lemons. The government also plays a role in trying to
reduce adverse selection problems in the used car market. All states have lemon laws that allow
buyers to return a used car for a full refund within a few days of purchase on the grounds that
some major problems can be detected after modest driving.
Insurance markets also employ strategies to reduce the problem of adverse selection.
Companies require medical exams, for example, and often impose restrictions on their willing-
ness to pay for treatment for preexisting conditions. Some companies offer better prices to people
based on verifiable health-related behavior such as not smoking.
Understanding the problem of adverse selection is also useful when we think about the pol-
icy issue of universal health coverage. In the United States, health coverage is provided by a mix of
the private sector (through employers and private purchase) and by the government through
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Under the U.S. system currently in use, many people have a
choice about what, if any, kind of health insurance they want to purchase given the premiums
that insurers offer. By contrast, in some countries, including much of Western Europe, everyone
receives health insurance, typically through a government program. A government program in
which everyone is covered, at least at some level, is known as universal health coverage. The Health
Care Reform Act of 2010 is moving the United States toward universal health coverage. While
there is considerable debate about the merits of moving to a universal health coverage system,
most economists agree that universal coverage reduces problems of adverse selection. When indi-
viduals can choose whether to be covered, on average, those who expect to most need medical
care will be most attracted to the insurance offer. To the extent that universal coverage reduces
choice, it reduces the adverse selection problem.

market signaling
Actions
taken by buyers and sellers to
communicate quality in a
world of uncertainty.
Market Signaling
We have discussed how asymmetric information between buyers and sellers can lead to adverse
selection. However, there are many things that can be done to overcome or at least reduce the
information problem. Michael Spence, who shared the Nobel Prize in Economics with George
Akerlof and Joseph Stiglitz in 2001, defined the concept of market signaling to help explain how
buyers and sellers communicate quality in a world of uncertainty.
The college admission process is a good example of how signaling works. In the year
2008–2009, the age group applying to college in the United States peaked. This is the result of
4.1 million births in 1990, record immigration, and an economy that provided young people with
an incentive to get a good education. Thus, the demand for spaces at the top schools far exceeded
the spaces available. Harvard University alone received over 27,000 applications for membership
in a class with fewer than 2,000 students. At the same time, many schools are far less selective and
some cannot even fill the chairs in their classrooms.
In selective admissions, the student is clearly “selling” in the admissions process and the col-
leges and universities are buying. Signaling results because the matching between students and
colleges involves communicating quality in a world of uncertainty.
The selective colleges and universities have uncertain information about the students that
they admit. While schools have concrete information such as test scores and grades, they do not
have concrete measures for other qualities that they are seeking. Thus, schools must look for
signals of those characteristics.
First, selective schools want students who are likely to be successful. They are seeking students
who are willing to work hard and who will do well academically. But schools also want students
who will contribute to society by becoming good scientists, artists, humanists, dancers, musicians,
businesspeople, and leaders. In their admissions forms, brochures, and Web sites, many selective
colleges and universities explain that they are “seeking students who will make a difference.”
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Adverse Selection in the Health Care Market
Health care is one area in which insurers worry about the problem of
adverse selection. A recent study on long-term care insurance and
Huntington’s disease (HD) illustrates the issue.1
Huntington’s disease is a degenerative neurological disorder. It
is caused by a genetic mutation and affects 1 in 10,000 individuals.
Onset typically occurs between ages 30 and 50 and individuals
become increasingly disabled as the disease progresses. Death typ-
ically occurs about 20 years after onset.
Given the inheritability of HD, any individual with a parent
who has the disease knows they have a 50 percent chance of hav-
ing HD. Moreover, since 1993, there has been a test that perfectly
predicts HD. Thus, individuals—because they know their family
history and because they can be tested—have or could have sub-
stantial information about their likelihood of eventually suffering
from HD. Insurers, on the other hand, while they can and typi-
cally do ask about health status, do not ask about family history
and are not at this point permitted to inquire about the results of
genetic tests. The health care reform bill of 2010 similarly requires
the government to provide a long-term care option with premi-
ums based only on age, not family or genetic history. Thus we
have clear conditions of asymmetric information favoring poten-
tial insurance buyers. As indicated, HD also results in a prolonged
period of severe disability, so that there is considerable benefit to
owning insurance.
In a long-term study of HD patients, Oster et al. found that
individuals who carry the HD genetic mutation are up to five
times as likely as the general population to buy long-term care
insurance, indicating that adverse selection is both present and
strong. For this population, the study finds that at current premi-
ums, long-term care insurance is a bargain: For an individual who
knows for sure that he or she will contract HD, the payout is
almost $4 for every $1 of premiums paid. As genetic testing
increases, situations of adverse selection in the health care area are
likely to increase and we will be confronted with harder choices on
how much genetic testing to reveal.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
How to Read Advertisements
Many high-end magazines, including alumni magazines for col-
leges, have a section at the back with advertisements for rentals of
vacation homes. Consider the following ad recently found in one
of those magazines.
St. Thomas Rental: “Lovely villa on the Caribbean island of St.
Thomas. Sleeps 6. Beautiful garden and pool area. Covered veranda
and barbecue. Available by the week or month.”
What conclusion should a discerning reader of this ad draw
about the property beyond what is written? The obvious conclusion
to be drawn from this ad by anyone who has studied economics is
that the property is not on or even near the beach.
Why do we conclude this? Ads are designed by people who want to
attract customers. So a first step in our deduction is to recognize that
the villa owner will mention any attractive and important positive fea-
ture that the villa has.On a Caribbean island,beachfront is a key attrac-
tion; thus, no mention of the beach tells us that this villa is not on or
near the beach.Recognizing that profit-seeking individuals place the ad
lets us draw conclusions about the information they do not provide.
This same logic can be used in a corporate setting. In 2002,
Congress and the president passed new accounting rules that require
firms to inform shareholders of the stock options they give to their
executives and the effect of those options on the firms’ costs.
Information could be embedded in the financial statements or
placed in the footnotes. Not surprisingly, those firms—typically the
dot-com firms—for whom options costs were large chose the less
transparent method of putting the information in the footnotes,
while more traditional firms, with fewer options to disclose, were
more forthcoming.
Sometimes the lack of information serves as a signal.
Developing a set of signals for identifying quality in admissions candidates is a difficult task,
but there are some generally accepted signals that the colleges and universities look at. Clearly,
they look beyond grades and standardized tests. “Quality of the program” is a term used to
describe the difficulty of the classes that the applicant took in high school. How many advanced
placement courses did the student take? How many years of math, science, and foreign language?
Did the student challenge himself or herself?
In addition to courses, extracurricular activities serve as a signal for future success.
Admissions professionals also see hours of practicing the violin or piano or soccer as signals of
students who dedicate energy to difficult challenges. Admissions professionals make these
assumptions about students because they have imperfect information.
Even without knowing about the theory of signals, most high school students recognize that
colleges reward extracurricular activities. Not surprisingly, this knowledge increases the incentive
of all students to engage in such activities. But how can extracurricular activities be a good signal
of interests and productivity if everyone begins to do them? If every high school senior belongs to
the French Club, membership ceases to have a signaling effect.
For extracurricular activities to remain useful as a good signal, they must be more easily
done by well-rounded and productive students than by other students. If a student who is truly
interested in writing and is well-organized about time management finds it easier to write for the
school paper, colleges can correctly infer that the newspaper writer is more likely to be interested
in writing and is a good manager. It would be too costly in terms of lost time and fun for some-
one who dislikes writing and is disorganized to join the newspaper staff just to signal colleges. For
signals to work, they must be costly and the cost of using them must be less for people who have
the trait that is valued. College admissions committees are, for this reason, beginning to think
about things like how many hours a given activity takes. Time-intensive activities are more
painful if a student does not really like the activity, and they involve more of a trade-off with
other academic pursuits.
For a signal to reduce the problem of adverse selection, then, it must be less costly for the high
quality-type person to obtain. Extracurricular activities work as a signal when the most committed
and brightest students are most able to do the activities and do well at school. Under those condi-
tions, these activities are thought of as a strong signal. In the job market, education is a strong signal.

362
PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Of course, education improves your life in many ways, as a consumer, a citizen, and a worker.
Education can directly improve your productivity in most jobs. But it can also signal a potential
employer that you are a productive person. Why is education a good signal? Education, like
extracurricular activities, is most easily attained by people who are disciplined, bright, and hard-
working. All of those qualities are valued in the workplace but are hard to certify—hence, the need
for a signal.
Signals are everywhere. Return for a moment to the used car example and the discussion of
warranties. We argued that a car for which a dealer offered a warranty was likely to be a peach.
Why? A warranty is a promise to pay for repairs for any defects. For a dealer, the warranty is
expensive to live up to only if the car is a lemon. Because a lemon will require more repairs than
a peach, providing a warranty for it will end up costing the dealer more. So the fact that a seller
offers a warranty is a strong signal that the car is a peach.
Under some conditions, a firm’s name can signal quality to consumers. Many airports now
have nail salons offering manicures to travelers with spare time. On the surface, though, it
appears that there might be a problem with adverse selection in the nail salon business. In a com-
munity, a nail salon that does a poor job for the money it charges is likely to go out of business.
The salon will have few return visitors, and word of mouth of its poor quality is likely to spread.
In an airport salon, return business is infrequent; thus, one might think that low-quality nail
salons would not be forced out of business. Given that quality is more expensive in terms of
labor costs and that consumers do not know whether a salon is good before they have a mani-
cure, one might expect bad salons to crowd out good salons in airports. Savvy consumers would
come to realize that only the desperate or those unconcerned with quality should get their nails
done in an airport. In fact, there is an offset to this story about the crowding out of good salons.
What we see in many airports is a shop that is part of a large chain of salons. The firm that owns
the chain recognizes that providing good care in a shop at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, for
example, will have positive reputation effects in the same-named shop at the St. Louis airport.
This gives the firm an incentive to provide better quality care at each airport. As a result, airport
visitors can view the brand name of the salon as a signal of its quality. One of the economic
advantages of a chain is its ability to provide some assurance to customers who are not local of a
common level of product quality at different locations. Next time you are traveling along the
interstate, look at the hotel and food choices at the rest stops. Most are chains for the reasons we
just described.

Another information problem that arises in insurance markets is moral hazard. Often people
enter into contracts in which the result of the contract, at least in part, depends on one of the par-
ties’ future behavior. A moral hazard problem arises when one party to a contract changes
behavior in response to that contract and thus passes the cost of its behavior on to the other party
to the contract. For example, accident insurance policies are contracts that agree to pay for repairs
to your car if it is damaged in an accident. Whether you have an accident depends in part on
whether you drive cautiously. Similarly, apartment leases may specify that the landlord will per-
form routine maintenance around the apartment. If you punch the wall every time you get angry,
your landlord ultimately pays the repair bill.
Such contracts can lead to inefficient behavior. The problem is like the externality problem
in which firms and households have no incentive to consider the full costs of their behavior. If
your car is fully insured against theft, why should you lock it? If health insurance provides new
glasses whenever you lose a pair, it is likely that you will be less careful.
In 2009, the U.S. government “bailed out” a number of firms in danger of failing: many
of the largest banks, AIG, and General Motors. Many economists who looked at these bailouts
warned about moral hazard. If the government is around to bail out banks when they fail,
what will govern the risks those banks will take? If General Motors and AIG are kept from
bankruptcy, will they too behave imprudently? “Moral hazard” became part of many head-
lines in 2009.
Like adverse selection, the moral hazard problem is an information problem. Contracting
parties cannot always determine the future behavior of the person with whom they are
moral hazard
Arises when
one party to a contract
changes behavior in response
to that contract and thus
passes on the costs of that
behavior change to the 
other party.

mechanism design
A
contract or an institution that
aligns the interests of two
parties in a transaction. A
piece rate, for example, creates
incentives for a worker to work
hard, just as his or her superior
wants. A co-pay in the health
care industry encourages
more careful use of health
care, just as the insurance
company wants.
contracting. If all future behavior could be predicted, contracts could be written to try to
eliminate undesirable behavior. Sometimes this is possible. Life insurance companies do not
pay off in the case of suicide during the first two years the policy is in force. Fire insurance
companies will not write a policy unless you have smoke detectors. If you cause unreason-
able damage to an apartment, your landlord can retain your security deposit. It is impossible 
to know everything about behavior and intentions. If a contract absolves one party of
the consequences of his or her action and people act in their own self-interest, the result 
is inefficient.
Incentives
The discussion of moral hazard provides us with a number of examples in which individuals who
buy insurance may have the wrong incentives when they make decisions. Incentives play an
important role in other areas of life as well. When firms hire, they want to make sure that their
workers have the incentive to work hard. Many employers provide bonuses for exemplary perfor-
mance to create incentives for their employees. In class, teachers try to provide incentives in the
form of positive feedback and grades to encourage students to learn the material. In designing
policies to deal with unemployment, poverty, and even international relations, governments con-
stantly worry about designing appropriate incentives.
In fact, most of our interest in incentives comes because of uncertainty. Because your
teacher or employer cannot always see how hard you are working, he or she wants to design
incentives to ensure that you work even when no one is watching. Grades and salary bonuses
play this role. Because insurance companies cannot monitor whether you lock your car door,
they would like to create incentives to encourage you to lock your doors even though you have
theft insurance.
Within economics, the area of mechanism design explores how transactions and contracts
can be designed so that, even under conditions of asymmetric information, self-interested people
have the incentive to behave properly. In 2007, Leonid Hurwicz, Roger Myerson, and Eric Maskin
won the Nobel Prize for their work in this area. While the field of mechanism design is a complex
one, a simple idea in the field is that different incentive schemes can cause people to reveal the
truth about themselves. In the following discussion, we will look at a few examples in the labor
market and the health care market to see how incentives can help reduce both adverse selection
and moral hazard in this way.
Labor Market Incentives
In the section on expected utility versus expected value, we described an employee trying to
choose between a job that offered a wage of $40,000 versus a coin toss that could bring him either
$20,000 or $60,000. We suggested that few employees would take such a deal, given risk aversion.
And yet many people do have wage contracts that contain some uncertainty. For many CEOs of
large U.S. companies, less than half of their compensation is in the form of a fixed salary. Most of
their pay comes from bonuses based on the firm’s profits or its stock market performance. Many
factory jobs pay piece wages that depend on how fast the worker is. Some of you may have had
summer jobs selling magazines where wages were uncertain. Why do we see these contracts, given
the risk aversion of most people?
These types of contracts occur because variable compensation can help firms get better
performance from their workforce. Suppose you are hiring one individual as a salesperson and
have two candidates, George and Harry. Both men seem to be affable, good with people, and
hard-working. How can you tell who will be a better salesperson? In this case, incentives can
play a powerful role. Suppose you offer George and Harry the following deal: The base pay for
this job is $25,000, but for every sale made beyond a certain level, a large commission is paid.
How valuable is this salary offer? That depends on how good George and Harry are as salespeo-
ple. If George knows he is an excellent salesperson, while Harry recognizes that despite his
good nature, he is lazy, only George will want to take this salary offer. The way the incentive
package is designed has caused the right person, the better salesperson, to select into the job.

S U M M A R Y
DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY: 
THE TOOLS p. 353
1. To find the expected value of a deal, you identify all possible
outcomes of the deal and find the payoffs associated with
those outcomes. Expected value is the weighted average of
those payoffs where the weights are the probability of each
payoff occurring.
2. In general, people do not accept uncertain deals with the
same expected value as certain deals.
3. Risk aversion exists when people prefer a certain outcome
to an uncertain outcome with an equal expected value.
Risk-neutral people are indifferent between these two deals,
and risk-loving people prefer the uncertain deal to its certain
equivalent.
4. Most people are risk-averse unless the payoffs are very small.
5. Income is subject to diminishing marginal utility, and this
diminishing marginal utility helps explain risk aversion.
ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION p. 357 
6. Choices made in the presence of imperfect information may
not be efficient. In the face of incomplete information, con-
sumers and firms may encounter the problem of adverse
selection. When buyers or sellers enter into market exchanges
with other parties who have more information, low-quality
goods are exchanged in greater numbers than high-quality
goods. Moral hazard arises when one party to a contract
passes the cost of its behavior on to the other party to the
contract. If a contract absolves one party of the consequences
of its actions and people act in their own self-interest, the
result is inefficient. Asymmetric information occurs when one
of the parties to a transaction has information relevant to the
transaction that the other party does not have.
7. In many cases, the market provides solutions to information
problems. Profit-maximizing firms will continue to gather
information as long as the marginal benefits from continued
search are greater than the marginal costs. Consumers will
do the same: More time is afforded to the information search
for larger decisions. In other cases, government must be
called on to collect and disperse information to the public.
8. Market signaling is a process by which sellers can communi-
cate to buyers their quality. For a signal to be meaningful, it
must be less expensive for high-quality types to acquire the
signal than for low-quality types.
INCENTIVES p. 363 
9. Correct incentive design can improve the selection mecha-
nism along with reducing the moral hazard problem.
10. Performance contracts in the labor market and co-pays in
the health insurance market are two examples of incentive
contracts.
Notice that in contrast to the problem of adverse selection described earlier in this chapter, this
incentive scheme creates beneficial selection dynamics. One reason that many companies
design compensation with a component that varies with performance is that they want to
attract the right kind of employees. In this case, the compensation scheme has screened out the
poor worker. Harry has revealed his own laziness by his job choice, as a result of the design of
the incentive.
Performance compensation plays another role as well. Once George has taken the job, the
fact that some of his salary depends on his hard work will encourage him to work even harder. Of
course, it is important that his compensation depend on things he can, in part, control. This is
one reason that in most companies, the CEO’s compensation is tied more to firm profitability
than is the salary of his or her executive assistant. Because the CEO has more control over prof-
itability, he or she should face the strongest performance incentives.
At the top levels in the investment banking industry, most compensation is performance-
based. In 2008, just before the financial meltdown, Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs,
received $73 million in compensation. Of that, $600,000 was in base pay! Many have argued that
compensation in the financial industry can be traced to excess risk taking.
In recent years, there have been efforts in some states to use more incentive compensa-
tion for public school teachers. In some cases, bonuses have been tied to student perfor-
mance on standardized tests. In a related set of experiments, New York City has a pilot
program to reward students who earn good grades with gifts such as cell phones. There has
been a lot of debate about the efficacy of both programs. Some people think that public
school teachers are already highly motivated and that monetary compensation is not likely to
have much effect. Others worry that teachers will “teach to the test,” suggesting that the
wrong behavior will be stimulated. Some worry that incentive pay will screen out committed
teachers, while other people believe it will improve retention of hard-working teachers. In
the case of public school students, critics worry that these incentives will turn learning from
a matter of love to one of commerce. These issues will likely be debated for some time 
to come.

*3. Your current salary is a fixed sum of $50,625 per year. You have
an offer for another job. The salary there is a flat $25,000 plus a
chance to earn $150,000 if the company does well. Assume that
your utility from income can be expressed as 
. So,
for example, at an income level of $100, your utility level is 10;
your utility level from the current salary of $50,625 is 225. How

to induce you to take this job?

present, he pays his workers an hourly wage. He is considering
changing to a piece rate, in which workers would be paid based

11. Mary’s local gym has two pricing options. If you pay by the day,
the charge is $10 per day. Alternatively, you can pay an annual
membership fee that allows you to exercise as often as you like

for $1,000. On average, Mary predicts that she would use the
gym once a week and the value of the 50 times per year she
would go is not enough to warrant a membership. Instead,
Mary decides to pay by the day.
a. At the end of the year, Mary finds that she went to the gym
only 25 times rather than the 50 she had predicted. She is
still sure, however, that with a membership, she would go
50 times and insists that economic logic supports her predic-
tion. What principle is she thinking about?
b. Mary’s employer has read a new health study that suggests
that people who work out at least once a week perform bet-
ter at work. The firm decides to give Mary and her coworkers
a cash bonus of $40 per week to cover the costs of going to
the health club four times a month. Do you think this policy
would be effective? If not, suggest an alternative that would
achieve the firm’s goal.
12. Sondra wants to purchase a small, used car and sees a 2008
Honda Civic DX listed on Craigslist for $7,000. She is willing to

reliable. What additional information might Sondra find helpful
in making her decision about the purchase?
13. One way insurance companies reduce adverse selection prob-
lems is by offering group medical coverage to large firms and
requiring all employees to participate in the coverage. Explain
how this reduces adverse selection.
14. Most casino game dealers in Las Vegas are paid minimum wage,
and therefore rely on tips for a large portion of their income.
Within the past few years, a majority of Las Vegas casinos have
instituted tip-pooling policies for their dealers, whereby dealers
are not allowed to keep the tips they earn; instead, they must pool
all of their tips to be evenly distributed to all dealers. How would
the tip-pooling system affect the productivity of the dealers?
15. Video poker is a very popular form of gambling in casinos, sec-
ond only to slot machines. Some video poker games offer a 
“double-up” feature, where players receiving a paying hand are
offered the chance to double their winnings. If a player chooses to
play the double-up feature, the machine deals one card from a 
52-card deck to the player and one to the “dealer.”If the player’s
card is higher than the dealer’s (with an ace being the highest
card), the player doubles his or her winnings. If the player’s card is
lower than the dealer’s card, the player loses his or her winnings. If
both are dealt cards of the same value (a push), the player keeps
his or her original bet. Explain whether the double-up feature is an
example of a fair game.

Fairness.
What role should government play
in the economy? Thus far we have
focused only on actions the govern-
ment might be called on to take to
improve market efficiency. Even if
we achieved markets that are per-
fectly efficient, would the result be
fair? We now turn to the question of
equity, or fairness.
Somehow the goods and ser-
vices produced in every society get
distributed among its citizens.
Some citizens end up with man-
sions in Palm Beach, ski trips to
Gstaad, and Ferraris; other citizens end up without enough to eat, and they live in shacks. This
chapter focuses on distribution. Why do some people get more than others? What are the sources
of inequality? Should the government change the distribution generated by the market?
The Sources of Household Income
Why do some people and some families have more income than others? Before we turn to data
on the distribution of income, let us review what we already know about the sources of
inequality. Households derive their incomes from three basic sources: (1) from wages or
salaries received in exchange for labor; (2) from property—that is, capital, land, and so on; and
(3) from government.
Wages and Salaries
More than half of personal income in the United States in 2007 was received in the form of wages
and salaries. If you add wage supplements, which include contributions for health insurance and
pensions, the figure is 64 percent. Hundreds of different wage rates are paid to employees for their
labor in thousands of different labor markets. As you saw in Chapter 10, perfectly competitive
market theory predicts that all factors of production (including labor) are paid a return equal to
their marginal revenue product—the market value of what they produce at the margin. There are
reasons why one type of labor might be more productive than another and why some households
have higher incomes than others.
Required Skills, Human Capital, and Working Conditions
Some people are born
with attributes that translate into valuable skills. LeBron James and Kevin Garnett are great bas-
ketball players, partly because they happen to be very tall. They did not decide to go out and invest
in height; they were born with the right genes. Some people have perfect pitch and beautiful voices;
others are tone deaf. Some people have quick mathematical minds; others cannot add 2 and 2.
The rewards of a skill that is in limited supply depend on the demand for that skill. Men’s
professional basketball is extremely popular, and the top NBA players make millions of dollars

Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
per year. There are great women basketball players too, but because women’s professional basket-
ball has not become popular in the United States, these women’s skills go comparatively unre-
warded. In tennis, however, people want to see women play, so women therefore earn prize
money similar to the money that men earn.
Some people with rare skills can make enormous salaries in an unfettered market economy.
Luciano Pavarotti had a voice that millions of people were willing to pay to hear in person and on
CDs. Some baseball players make tens of millions of dollars per year. Before Pablo Picasso died,
he could sell small sketches for vast sums of money. Were they worth it? They were worth exactly
what the highest bidder was willing to pay.
Not all skills are inborn. Some people have invested in training and schooling to improve
their knowledge and skills, and therein lies another source of inequality in wages. When we go to
school, we are investing in human capital that we expect to yield dividends, partly in the form
of higher wages, later on. Human capital, the stock of knowledge and skills that people possess,
is also produced through on-the-job training. People learn their jobs and acquire “firm-specific”
skills when they are on the job. Thus, in most occupations, there is a reward for experience. Pay
scale often reflects numbers of years on the job, and those with more experience earn higher
wages than those in similar jobs with less experience.
Some jobs are more desirable than others. Entry-level positions in “glamour” industries
such as media tend to be low-paying. Because talented people are willing to take entry-level jobs
in these industries at salaries below what they could earn in other occupations, there must be
other, nonwage rewards. It may be that the job itself is more personally rewarding or that a low-
paying apprenticeship is the only way to acquire the human capital necessary to advance. In
contrast, less desirable jobs often pay wages that include compensating differentials. Of two
jobs requiring roughly equal levels of experience and skills that compete for the same workers,
the job with the poorer working conditions usually has to pay a slightly higher wage to attract
workers away from the job with the better working conditions.
Compensating differentials are also required when a job is very dangerous. Those who take
great risks are usually rewarded with high wages. High-beam workers on skyscrapers and bridges
command premium wages. Firefighters in cities that have many old, run-down buildings are usu-
ally paid more than firefighters in relatively tranquil rural or suburban areas.
Multiple Household Incomes
Another source of wage inequality among households lies
in the fact that many households have more than one earner in the labor force. Second, and even
third, incomes are becoming more the rule than the exception for U.S. families. In 1960, about
37 percent of women over the age of 16 were in the labor force. By 1978, the figure had increased
to over 50 percent, and it continued to climb slowly but steadily to over 60 percent in 2007.
The Minimum Wage Controversy
One strategy for reducing wage inequity that has been
used for almost 100 years in many countries is the minimum wage. (The minimum wage and price
floors were discussed in Chapter 4.) A minimum wage is the lowest wage firms are permitted to pay
workers. The first minimum wage law was adopted in New Zealand in 1894. The United States
adopted a national minimum wage with the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,
although many individual states had laws on the books much earlier.The minimum wage was raised
to $7.25 in the summer of 2009.
In recent years, the minimum wage has come under increasing attack. Opponents argue that
minimum wage legislation interferes with the smooth functioning of the labor market and cre-
ates unemployment. Proponents argue that it has been successful in raising the wages of the
poorest workers and alleviating poverty without creating much unemployment.
These arguments can best be understood with a simple supply and demand graph.
Figure 18.1 shows hypothetical demand and supply curves for unskilled labor. The equilibrium
wage rate is $5.40. At that wage, the quantity of unskilled labor supplied and the quantity of
unskilled labor demanded are equal. Now suppose that a law is passed setting a minimum wage
of $6.55. At that wage rate, the quantity of labor supplied increases from the equilibrium level,
L*, to LS. At the same time, the higher wage reduces the quantity of labor demanded by firms,
from L* to LD. As a result, firms lay off L* - LD workers.
It is true that those workers who remain on payrolls receive higher wages. With the mini-
mum wage in effect, unskilled workers receive $6.55 per hour instead of $5.40. But is it worth it?
Some workers gain while others (including those who had been employed at the equilibrium
wage) suffer unemployment.
human capital

knowledge, skills, and talents
that people possess; it can be
inborn or acquired through
education and training.
minimum wage
The lowest
wage that firms are permitted
to pay workers.
compensating differentials
Differences in wages that result
from differences in working
conditions. Risky jobs usually
pay higher wages; highly
desirable jobs usually pay
lower wages.

CHAPTER 18
Income Distribution and Poverty 369
In fact, the evidence on the extent to which the minimum wage causes jobs to be lost is
unclear. Professor Finis Welch at Texas A&M and two colleagues estimated in a recent study that
each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage produces job losses of about 1 percent of all min-
imum wage workers, or about 60,000 workers in total at the time of the study. But other studies
find little or no effect on the number of jobs lost when the minimum wage increases. Two earlier
studies by David Card of the University of California at Berkeley and one by Lawrence Katz of
Harvard and Alan Krueger of Princeton University found that an increase in the minimum wage
had virtually no effect on unemployment.
Unemployment
Before turning to property income, we need to mention another cause of
inequality in the United States that is the subject of much discussion in macroeconomics:
unemployment.
People earn wages only when they have jobs. In recent years, the United States has been through
three severe recessions (economic downturns). In 1975, the unemployment rate hit 9 percent and
over 8 million people were unable to find work. In 1982, the unemployment rate was nearly 11 per-
cent and over 12 million were jobless. More recently, the recovery from the milder recession of 1990
to 1991 was slow at first. By 2000, the number of unemployed dropped below 5.5 million (an unem-
ployment rate of 3.9 percent), but by 2008, it was back to 15.2 million, or 10 percent.
Unemployment hurts primarily those who are laid off, and thus its costs are narrowly dis-
tributed. For some workers, the costs of unemployment are lowered by unemployment compen-
sation benefits paid out of a fund accumulated with receipts from a tax on payrolls.
Income from Property
Another source of income inequality is that some people have property income—from the own-
ership of real property and financial holdings—while many others do not. Some people own a
great deal of wealth, and some have no assets at all. Overall, about 22 percent of personal income
in the United States in 2007 came from ownership of property. The amount of property income
that a household earns depends on (1) how much property it owns and (2) what kinds of assets it
owns. Such income generally takes the form of profits, interest, dividends, and rents.
Households come to own assets through saving and through inheritance. Some of today’s
large fortunes were inherited from previous generations. The Rockefellers, the Kennedys, and the
Fords, to name a few, still have large holdings of property originally accumulated by previous gen-
erations. Thousands of families receive smaller inheritances each year from their parents. (In
2010, taxation of these estates was an important political issue.) Most families receive little
through inheritance; most of their wealth or property comes from saving.
Often fortunes accumulate in a single generation when a business becomes successful. The
late Sam Walton built a personal fortune estimated at over $70 billion on a chain of retail stores
including Wal-Mart. Forbes magazine estimated that Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, was worth

corner store in Germany and expanding to 8,500 stores in 2009 in Germany and 10 other coun-
tries. In the United States, they own the gourmet food-and-beverage chain Trader Joe’s. Forbes
estimated that there were over 1,011 billionaires in the world in 2009. The richest man in the
world in 2009 was Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim Helu with an estimated $53.5 billion in wealth.
Income from the Government: Transfer Payments
About 14 percent of personal income in 2007 came from governments in the form of transfer
payments. Transfer payments are payments made by government to people who do not supply
goods or services in exchange. Some, but not all, transfer payments are made to people with
low incomes precisely because they have low incomes. Transfer payments thus reduce the
amount of inequality in the distribution of income. Not all transfer income goes to the poor.
The biggest single transfer program at the federal level is Social Security. Transfer programs are
by and large designed to provide income to those in need. They are part of the government’s
attempts to offset some of the problems of inequality and poverty.
The Distribution of Income
Economic income is defined as the amount of money a household can spend during a given
period without increasing or decreasing its net assets. Economic income includes anything that
enhances your ability to spend—wages, salaries, dividends, interest received, proprietors’ income,
transfer payments, rents, and so on. If you own an asset (such as a share of stock) that increases in
value, that gain is part of your income whether or not you sell the asset to “realize” the gain.
Normally, we speak of “before-tax” income, with taxes considered a use of income.
Income Inequality in the United States
Table 18.1 presents some estimates of the distribution of several income components and of total
income for households in 2006. The measure of income used to calculate these figures is very
broad; it includes both taxable and nontaxable items, as well as estimates of realized capital gains.

The data are presented by “quintiles”; that is, the total number of households is first ranked
by income and then split into five groups of equal size. In 2006, the top quintile earned 47.5 per-
cent of total income while the bottom quintile earned just 3.4 percent. The top 1 percent (which
is part of the top quintile) earned more than the bottom 40 percent. Labor income was less evenly
distributed than total income.
Income from property is more unevenly distributed than wages and salaries. Property income
comes from owning things:Land earns rent,stocks earn dividends and appreciate in value,bonds and
deposit accounts earn interest, owners of small businesses earn profits, and so on. The top 20 percent
of households earned 65.5 percent of property income,and the top 1 percent earned over 30 percent.
Transfer payments include Social Security benefits, unemployment compensation, and welfare
payments, as well as an estimate of nonmonetary transfers from the government to households—
food stamps and Medicaid and Medicare program benefits, for example. Transfers flow to low-
income households, but not solely to them. Social Security benefits, for example, which account
for about half of all transfer payments, flow to everyone who participated in the system 
for the requisite number of years and has reached the required age regardless of income.

CHAPTER 18
Income Distribution and Poverty 371
1 The term household includes unmarried individuals living alone and groups of people living together who are not related by
blood, marriage, or adoption. In the United States in 2008, there was a total of 116.8 million households and 38.9 million
nonfamily households.
Nonetheless, transfers represent a more important income component at the bottom of the dis-
tribution than at the top. Although not shown in Table 18.1, transfers account for more than 
80 percent of the income of the bottom 10 percent of households, but only about 3 percent of
income among the top 10 percent of households.
Changes in the Distribution of Income
Table 18.2 presents the distribution of
money income among U.S. households1 at a number of points in time. Money income, the mea-
sure used by the Census Bureau in its surveys and publications, is slightly less complete than the
income measure used in the calculations in Table 18.1. The measure does not include noncash
transfer benefits, for example, and does not include capital gains.

Since 1975, there has been a slow but steady drift toward more inequality. During those
years, the share of income going to the top 5 percent has increased from 16.4 percent to 21.7 per-
cent while the share going to the bottom 40 percent has fallen from 14.8 percent to 12 percent.
The Lorenz Curve and the Gini Coefficient
The distribution of income can 
be graphed in several ways. The most widely used graph is the Lorenz curve, shown in 
Figure 18.2. Plotted along the horizontal axis is the percentage of households, and along the
money income
The measure
of income used by the Census
Bureau. Because money
income excludes noncash
transfer payments and capital
gains income, it is less inclusive
than economic income.

inequality of income derived
from a Lorenz curve. It can range
from 0 to a maximum of 1.
vertical axis is the cumulative percentage of income. The curve shown here represents the
year 2009, using data from Table 18.2.
During that year, the bottom 20 percent of households earned only 3.4 percent of total
money income. The bottom 40 percent earned 12.0 percent (3.4 percent plus 8.6 percent), and so
on. If income were distributed equally—that is, if the bottom 20 percent earned 20 percent of the
income, the bottom 40 percent earned 40 percent of the income, and so on—the Lorenz curve
would be a 45-degree line between 0 and 100 percent. More unequal distributions produce
Lorenz curves that are farther from the 45-degree line.
The Gini coefficient is a measure of the degree of inequality in a distribution. It is the ratio
of the shaded area in Figure 18.2 to the total triangular area below and to the right of the diago-
nal line 0A. If income is equally distributed, there is no shaded area (because the Lorenz curve
and the 45-degree line are the same) and the Gini coefficient is zero. The Lorenz curves for distri-
butions with more inequality are farther down to the right, their shaded areas are larger, and their
Gini coefficients are higher. The maximum Gini coefficient is 1. As the Lorenz curve shifts down
to the right, the shaded area becomes a larger portion of the total triangular area below 0A. If one
family earned all the income (with no one else receiving anything), the shaded area and the trian-
gle would be the same and the ratio would equal 1.
Differences Among African-American Households, White Households,
and Single-Person Households
Looking just at households without differentiating
them in any way hides some needed distinctions. Income distribution differs significantly
among African-American, Hispanic, and white households.
Table 18.3 presents data on the distribution of money income for different types of house-
holds. The differences among the groupings are dramatic. In 2008, the bottom 20 percent of
white households had a mean household income that was twice that of the bottom 20 percent
of African-American households. For the middle 20 percent of households, mean income for
white households was 65 percent higher than mean income for African-American households.
For Hispanics, the figure was 42 percent. The top 5 percent of white households averaged
$310,032 of income. For African-Americans, it was $199,353; for Hispanics, $218,396.

The World Distribution of Income
Data on the distribution of income across rich and poor nations reveal much more inequality,as shown
in Table 18.4. The population of the world in 2008 was approximately 6.7 billion. Of that number, 1.0
billion, or 15 percent, live in what the World Bank classifies as low-income countries. The average
income per capita in those countries was $524 in 2008. The same year about 1.1 billion, or 15 percent,
lived in high-income countries, where per-capita income was $39,345.When you look at total national
income,the rich countries with 15 percent of the population earn 73.0 percent of world income, while
the poor countries with 15 percent of the population get only 1.0 percent of world income. The
poorest country in the world in 2008 was Burundi, with 8 million people and a per-capita income
of $140 per year. The richest country was Norway, with 5 million people and a per-capita income
of $87,070.2
As we discussed earlier, income inequality has increased within the United States over the last
several decades. The evidence also suggests that income inequality is increasing in most other
advanced countries as well as in Asia and Latin America. Among the advanced economies, only

CHAPTER 18
Income Distribution and Poverty 373
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
The New Rich Work!
Recent work by two economists, Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel
Saez, documents the rise in income inequality in the United States
described in the text and reports further that the bulk of the new
inequality comes not from owners of capital, but from inequality in
returns to the workforce.1 As Piketty and Saez put it, “The working
rich have now replaced the coupon-clipping rentiers.”
In the recent recessionary period, there has been much media
and public interest in executive compensation that further calls our
attention to the returns to labor at the very top end of the work-
force, the executives who run our major banks and corporations.
There is considerable evidence that executive compensation has
increased across a wide swath of firms, while the real wage of the
average worker has stagnated. There is less consensus, however, as
to why wages of executives have risen. Within economics there is
debate about whether the rise in corporate pay comes from changes
in the market, like growth of average firm size and the importance
of scarce human capital, or from changes in corporate governance
and social norms.
One interesting recent study of executive compensation by
Carola Frydman at MIT traces the changes in executive compen-
sation in one iconic American firm, General Electric. The chart
shows the dramatic increases in real executive pay over the post-
war period.
Notes: Compensation is measured as the three-year moving-average for each
measure of pay for the three highest-paid executives as reported in General
Electric’s proxy statements. Salary and Bonus is defined as the level of salaries
and current bonuses both awarded and paid out in the year. Long-Term (L-T)
Bonus measures the amount paid out in the year from long-term bonuses
awarded in prior years. Stock Option Grants is defined as the Black-Scholes
value of stock options granted in the given year. The real level of pay is calcu-
lated in millions of $2000, using the CPI.

France has seen decreasing inequality. Inequality has increased everywhere in the developing
world except Africa and the Middle East.
Causes of Increased Inequality
The increased income inequality we see in the United States and in many other regions has
become the subject of much political debate. Much of the debate concerns what we as a nation
and as a member of the world community should do to improve the position of the poorest of
our citizens. We will describe these economic issues in the next section of this chapter. But
equally debated is the question of what has caused the rise in inequality. Is it the forces of free
trade, immigration, and globalization all working together to worsen the position of the middle-
income workers who find themselves competing with workers in lower-income countries? Is 
it the declining power of unions and deregulation that have opened up more labor markets to
the forces of competition? Some have argued that a major force in increasing inequality has
been technological change that has favored the well-educated worker at the expense of
unskilled labor.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
3 David Card,“The Impact of the Mariel Boat Lift on the Miami Labor Market,” Industrial and Labor Relations Review, January
1990, pp. 245–257.
These are very difficult questions, questions that are becoming part of the political debate
across the world. Consider the role that immigration plays, for example. Most immigrants to the
United States come from lower-income countries. Movement of labor from low-income areas to
higher-income areas is a natural economic phenomena, a manifestation of the forces of supply
and demand in labor markets. Unchecked, these movements have the capacity to reduce costs of
production in the high-wage country, increasing the return to capital, and to reduce world
income inequality. Immigration also may play a role in increasing within-country inequality to
the extent that it brings a new group of less-skilled workers into a country, potentially competing
for jobs with the lower-income population already in the country.
Empirical evidence of the extent to which immigration has in fact reduced wages of lower-
income workers is mixed.
The Evidence: The Net Costs of Immigration
To determine whether the net bene-
fits of immigration outweigh its net costs, we must ask one important question: To what extent
does immigration reduce domestic wages and increase unemployment? A number of recent stud-
ies have found that metropolitan areas with greater numbers of immigrants seem to have only
slightly lower wages and only slightly higher unemployment rates.
An influential study by economist David Card of the University of California, Berkeley, looks
carefully at wages and employment opportunities in the Miami metropolitan area during and
after the Mariel boat lift of 1980. Almost overnight about 125,000 Cubans arrived in Florida and
increased the labor force in Miami by over 7 percent. Card looked at trends in wages and unem-
ployment among Miami workers between 1980 and 1985 and found virtually no effect. In addi-
tion, the data he examined mirrored the experience of workers in Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta,
and similar cities that were not hit by the same shock.3
However, a more recent study by Borjas, Freeman, and Katz takes issue with much of the
work done to date. They argue that immigrants do not stay in the cities at which they arrive, but
rather move within the United States in response to job opportunities and wage differentials.
Thus, they argue that the effects of immigration on wages and unemployment must be analyzed
at the national level, not the city level. Their study points to the large decline in the wages of high
school dropouts relative to workers with more education during the 1980s. Their results suggest
that a third of the drop in the relative wages of high school dropouts can be attributed to lower-
skilled immigrants.4
It is clear that immigration is not an issue simply for the United States. For someone in
Guatemala, Mexico offers new opportunities. Per-capita income in Guatemala is $2,640 and is
$7,870 in Mexico. Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world, sends people to the Dominican
Republic in search of work. In fact, the World Bank estimates that in 2007, 74 million migrants
moved from one developing country to another. Here, too, there are lively debates about the
effects of this migration on incomes and inequality.
Technological change also appears to play a role in the increases in inequality. In the last
several decades, technological advances have played a strong role in development. In the
United States and the developing world, more work is conducted with the aid of computers
and less work requires large inputs of unskilled labor. The result has been a wage premium for
skilled workers.5 In fact, work by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that by look-
ing at the growth in inequality in regions around the world, the central force has been techno-
logical change with its increased skill needs. The role of technology in increasing inequality
appears to be especially large in Asia. The opening up of economies to free trade has played a
modest role relative to technology. In fact, the IMF finds that in the advanced countries, free
trade has decreased inequality by replacing low-paid manufacturing jobs with higher-paid jobs
in the service sector.
The important role of technology in driving inequality suggests that going forward, educa-
tion may be key to reducing inequality in the United States and across the world.

Poverty
Most of the government’s concern with income distribution and redistribution has focused on
poverty. Poverty is a very complicated word to define. In simplest terms, it means the condition of
people who have very low incomes. The dictionary defines the term simply as “lack of money or
material possessions,” but how low does your income have to be before you are classified as poor?
The Problem of Definition
Philosophers and social policy makers have long debated
the meaning of “poverty.” One school of thought argues that poverty should be measured by
determining how much it costs to buy the “basic necessities of life.”For many years, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics published “family budget” data designed to track the cost of specific “bundles” of
food, clothing, and shelter that were supposed to represent the minimum standard of living.
Critics argue that defining bundles of necessities is a hopeless task. Although it might be pos-
sible to define a minimally adequate diet, what is a “minimum” housing unit? Is a car a necessity?
What about medical care? In reality, low-income families end up using what income they have in
an enormous variety of ways.
Some say that poverty is culturally defined and is therefore a relative concept, not an absolute
one.Poverty in Bangladesh is very different from poverty in the United States.Even within the United
States,urban poverty is very different from rural poverty.If poverty is a relative concept,the definition
of it might change significantly as a society accumulates wealth and achieves higher living standards.
Although it is difficult to define precisely, the word poverty is one that we all understand
intuitively to some degree. It conveys images of run-down, overcrowded, rat-infested housing;
homeless people; untreated illness; and so on. It is also a word that we have been forced to define
formally for purposes of keeping statistics and administering public programs.
The Official Poverty Line
In the early 1960s, the U.S. government established an official
poverty line. Because poor families tend to spend about one-third of their incomes on food, the
official poverty line has been set at a figure that is simply three times the cost of the Department
of Agriculture’s minimum food budget.
The minimum food budget was only calculated once, in 1963. It has been updated with the
Consumer Price Index since that year. Needless to say these figures are somewhat arbitrary, but they are
still used to determine the official poverty rate.For 2007,the threshold for a family of four was $21,027.
After years of study and debate, the Department of Health and Human Services began pub-
lishing an alternative measure of poverty now called the Poverty Guidelines. The new and some-
what more complex methodology produces income limits that define eligibility for a number of
programs including food stamps and Medicaid. The Department set the figure at $21,200 for a
family of four in 2008.
Poverty in the United States Since 1960
In 1962, Michael Harrington published The
Other America: Poverty in the United States, a book that woke the American people to the problem of
poverty and stimulated the government to declare a “war on poverty” in 1964. In 1960, official fig-
ures had put the number of the poor in the United States at just under 40 million, or 22 percent of
the total population. In his book, Harrington argued that the number had reached over 50 million.
By the late 1960s, the number living below the official poverty line had declined to about
25 million, where it stayed for over a decade. Between 1978 and 1983, the number of poor
jumped nearly 45 percent, from 24.5 million to 35.3 million, the highest number since 1964. The
figure stood at 43.6 million in 2009. As a percentage of the total population, the poor accounted
for between 11 percent and 12.6 percent of the population throughout the 1970s. That figure
increased sharply to 15.2 percent between 1979 and 1983. From 1983 to 1989, the rate dropped to
12.8 percent, rising back to 14.5 percent in 1995. The rate rose to 14.3 in 2009.
While the official 2009 figures put the poverty rate at 14.3 percent of the population, they
also show that some groups in society experience more poverty than others. Table 18.5 shows
the official poverty count for 1964 and 2009 by demographic group. One of the problems with
the official count is that it considers only money income as defined by the census and is there-
fore somewhat inflated. Many federal programs designed to help people out of poverty include
noncash benefits (sometimes called in-kind benefits) such as food stamps and public housing. If
added to income, these benefits would reduce the number of those officially designated as below
the poverty line to about 9 percent of the population.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
The poverty rate among African-Americans is more than twice as high as the poverty rate
among whites. Nearly one in four African-Americans live in poverty. In addition, a slightly lower
proportion of Hispanics than African-Americans had incomes below the poverty line in 2009.
The group with the highest incidence of poverty in 2009 was women living in households
with no husband present. In 1964, 45.9 percent of such women lived in poverty. By 2009, the fig-
ure was still 29.9 percent. During the 1980s, there was increasing concern about the “feminization
of poverty,” a concern that continues today.
Poverty rates among the elderly have been reduced considerably over the last few decades,
dropping from 28.5 percent in 1964 to 8.9 percent in 2009. Certainly, Social Security, supplemental
security income, and Medicare have played a role in reducing poverty among the elderly. In 1964,
20.7 percent of all children under 18 lived in poverty, and in 2009, the figure was 20.7 percent.
The Distribution of Wealth
Data on the distribution of wealth are not as readily available as data on the distribution of income.
Periodically,however,the government conducts a detailed survey of the holdings that make up wealth.
The results show that the top 10 percent of households held just under 70 percent of the total net
worth in the United States in 2004 while the bottom 40 percent of households held only 2.6 percent.
The distribution of wealth is more unequal than the distribution of income. Part of the reason is
that wealth is passed from generation to generation and accumulates. Large fortunes also accumulate
when small businesses become successful large businesses.Some argue that an unequal distribution of
wealth is the natural and inevitable consequence of risk taking in a market economy: It provides the
incentive necessary to motivate entrepreneurs and investors. Others believe that too much inequality
can undermine democracy and lead to social conflict. Many of the arguments for and against income
redistribution, discussed in the next section, apply equally well to wealth redistribution.
The Utility Possibilities Frontier
Ideally, in discussing distribution, we should talk not about the distribution of income or
goods and services, but about the distribution of well-being. In the nineteenth century,
philosophers used the concept of utility as a measure of well-being. As they saw it, people make
choices among goods and services on the basis of the utility those goods and services yield.
People act to maximize utility. If you prefer a night at the symphony to a rock concert, the rea-
son is that you expect to get more utility from the symphony. If we extend this thinking, we
might argue that if household A gets more total utility than household B, A is better off than B.
Utility is not directly observable or measurable, but thinking about it as if it were can help us
understand some of the ideas that underlie debates about distribution. Suppose society consisted
of two people, I and J. Next, suppose that the line PP
 in Figure 18.3 represents all the combina-
tions of I’s utility and J’s utility that are possible, given the resources and technology available in
their society. (This is an extension of the production possibilities frontier in Chapter 2.)
Any point inside PP
, or the utility possibilities frontier, is inefficient because both I and J
could be better off. A is one such point. B is one of many possible points along PP
 that society
should prefer to A because both members are better off at B than they are at A.
While point B is preferable to point A from everyone’s point of view, how does point B com-
pare with point C? Both B and C are efficient; I cannot be made better off without making J worse
off, and vice versa. All the points along PP
 are efficient, but they may not be equally desirable. If

Income Distribution and Poverty 377
all the assumptions of perfectly competitive market theory held, the market system would lead to
one of the points along PP
. The actual point reached would depend on I’s and J’s initial endow-
ments of wealth, skills, and so on.
In practice, however, the market solution leaves some people out. The rewards of a market
system are linked to productivity, and some people in every society are simply not capable of
being very productive or have not had the opportunity to become more productive. All societies
make some provision for the very poor. Most often, public expenditures on behalf of the poor are
financed with taxes collected from the rest of society. Society makes a judgment that those who
are better off should give up some of their rewards so that those at the bottom can have more
than the market system would allocate to them. In a democratic state, such redistribution is pre-
sumably undertaken because a majority of the members of that society think it is fair, or just.
Early economists drew analogies between social choices among alternative outcomes and
consumer choices among alternative outcomes. A consumer chooses on the basis of his or her
own unique utility function, or measure of his or her own well-being. Society, economists said,
chooses on the basis of a social welfare function that embodies the society’s ethics.
Such theoretical discussions of fairness and equity focus on the distribution and redistribution
of utility. Because utility is neither observable nor measurable, most discussions of social policy cen-
ter on the distribution of income or the distribution of wealth as indirect measures of well-being, as we
have done. It is important that you remember, however, that income and wealth are imperfect mea-
sures of well-being. Someone with a profound love of the outdoors may choose to work in a national
park for a low wage instead of a consulting firm in a big city for a high wage. The choice reveals that
she is better off even though her measured income is lower. As another example, think about five
people with $1 each. Now suppose that one of those people has a magnificent voice, and that the
other four give up their dollars to hear her sing. The exchange leads to inequality of measured
wealth—the singer has $5 and no one else has any—but all are better off than they were before.
Although income and wealth are imperfect measures we have of utility, they have no
observable substitutes and are therefore the measures we have used throughout this chapter.
The Redistribution Debate
Debates about the role of government in correcting for inequality in the distribution of income
revolve around philosophical and practical issues. Philosophical issues deal with the “ideal.”What
should the distribution of income be if we could give it any shape we desired? What is “fair”?
What is “just”? Practical issues deal with what is and what is not possible. Suppose we wanted zero
poverty. How much would it cost, and what would we sacrifice? When we take wealth or income
away from higher-income people and give it to lower-income people, do we destroy incentives?
What are the effects of this kind of redistribution?
Policy makers must deal with both kinds of issues, but it seems logical to confront the philosoph-
ical issues first. If you do not know where you want to go, you cannot explain how to get there or how
much it costs. You may find that you do not want to go anywhere at all. Many respected economists
and philosophers argue quite convincingly that the government should not redistribute income.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Arguments Against Redistribution
Those who argue against government redistribution believe that the market, when left to operate on
its own, is fair. This argument rests on the proposition that “one is entitled to the fruits of one’s
efforts.”6 Remember that if market theory is correct,rewards paid in the market are linked to produc-
tivity. In other words, labor and capital are paid in accordance with the value of what they produce.
This view also holds that property income—income from land or capital—is no less justified
than labor income. All factors of production have marginal products. Capital owners receive
profits or interest because the capital they own is productive.
The argument against redistribution also rests on the principles behind “freedom of contract”
and the protection of property rights. When you agree to sell your labor or to commit your capital
to use, you do so freely. In return, you contract to receive payment, which becomes your “property.”
When a government taxes you and gives your income to someone else,that action violates those two
basic rights.
The more common arguments against redistribution are not philosophical. Instead, they
point to more practical problems. First, it is said that taxation and transfer programs interfere
with the basic incentives provided by the market. Taxing higher-income people reduces their
incentive to work, save, and invest. Taxing the “winners” of the economic game also discourages
risk taking. Furthermore, providing transfers to those at the bottom reduces their incentive to
work as well. All of this leads to a reduction in total output that is the “cost” of redistribution.
Another practical argument against redistribution is that it does not work. Some critics see
the rise in the poverty rate during the early 1980s, again in the early 1990s, and yet again between
2001 and 2004 as an indication that antipoverty programs simply drain money without really
helping the poor out of poverty. Whether these programs actually help people out of poverty, the
possibility of bureaucratic inefficiency in administration always exists. Social programs must be
administered by people who must be paid. The Department of Health and Human Services
employs over 120,000 people to run the Social Security system, process Medicaid claims, and so
on. Some degree of waste and inefficiency is inevitable in any sizable bureaucracy.
Arguments in Favor of Redistribution
The argument most often used in favor of redistribution is that a society as wealthy as the United
States has a moral obligation to provide all its members with the necessities of life. The
Constitution does carry a guarantee of the “right to life.” In declaring war on poverty in 1964,
President Lyndon Johnson put it this way:
6 Powerful support for this notion of “entitlement” can be found in the works of the seventeenth-century English philosophers
Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.
There will always be some Americans who are better off than others. But it need not follow
that the “poor are always with us.”...It is high time to redouble and to concentrate our
efforts to eliminate poverty....We know what must be done and this nation of abundance
can surely afford to do it.7
Many people, often through no fault of their own, find themselves left out. Some are born
with mental or physical problems that severely limit their ability to “produce.” Then there are
children. Even if some parents can be held accountable for their low incomes, do we want to pun-
ish innocent children for the faults of their parents and thus perpetuate the cycle of poverty? The
elderly, without redistribution of income, would have to rely exclusively on savings to survive
once they retire, and many conditions can lead to inadequate savings. Should the victims of bad
luck be doomed to inevitable poverty? Illness is perhaps the best example. The accumulated sav-
ings of very few people can withstand the drain of extraordinary hospital and doctors’ bills and
the exorbitant cost of nursing home care.
Proponents of redistribution refute “practical” arguments against it by pointing to studies
that show little negative effect on the incentives of those who benefit from transfer programs. For

CHAPTER 18
Income Distribution and Poverty 379
many—children, the elderly, the mentally ill—incentives are irrelevant, they say, and providing a
basic income to most of the unemployed does not discourage them from working when they have
the opportunity to do so. We now turn briefly to several more formal arguments.
Utilitarian Justice
First put forth by the English philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John
Stuart Mill in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the essence of the utilitarian
argument in favor of redistribution is that “a dollar in the hand of a rich person is worth less than
a dollar in the hand of a poor person.” The rich spend their marginal dollars on luxury goods. It
is easy to spend over $100 per person for a meal in a good restaurant in New York or Los Angeles.
The poor spend their marginal dollars on necessities—food, clothing, and medical care. If the
marginal utility of income declines as income rises, the value of a dollar’s worth of luxury goods
is worth less than a dollar’s worth of necessities. Thus, redistributing from the rich to the poor
increases total utility. To put this notion of utilitarian justice in everyday language: Through
income redistribution, the rich sacrifice a little and the poor gain a great deal.
The utilitarian position is not without problems. People have very different tastes and prefer-
ences. Who is to say that you value a dollar more or less than I do? Because utility is unobservable
and unmeasurable, comparisons between individuals cannot be easily made. Nonetheless, many
people find the basic logic of the utilitarians to be persuasive.
Social Contract Theory—Rawlsian Justice
The work of Harvard philosopher John Rawls
has generated a great deal of recent discussion, both within the discipline of economics and between
economists and philosophers.8 In the tradition of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, Rawls argues that as
members of society,we have a contract with one another.In the theoretical world that Rawls imagines,
an original social contract is drawn up and all parties agree to it without knowledge of who they are or
who they will be in society.This condition is called the “original position”or the “state of nature.”With
no vested interests to protect, members of society are able to make disinterested choices.
As we approach the contract, everyone has a chance to end up very rich or homeless. On the
assumption that we are all “risk-averse,”Rawls believes that people will attach great importance to
the position of the least fortunate members of society because anyone could end up there.
Rawlsian justice is argued from the assumption of risk aversion. Rawls concludes that any con-
tract emerging from the original position would call for an income distribution that would “max-
imize the well-being of the worst-off member of society.”
Any society bound by such a contract would allow for inequality, but only if that inequality
had the effect of improving the lot of the very poor. If inequality provides an incentive for people
to work hard and innovate, for example, those inequalities should be tolerated as long as some of
the benefits go to those at the bottom.
The Works of Karl Marx
For decades, a rivalry existed between the United States and the
Soviet Union. At the heart of this rivalry was a fundamental philosophical difference of opinion
about how economic systems work and how they should be managed. At the center of the debate
were the writings of Karl Marx.
Marx did not write very much about socialism or communism. His major work, Das Kapital
(published in the nineteenth century), was a three-volume analysis and critique of the capitalist
system that he saw at work in the world around him. We know what Marx thought was wrong
with capitalism, but he was not very clear about what should replace it. In one essay late in his life,
he wrote,“from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,”9 but he was not spe-
cific about the applications of this principle.
Marx’s view of capital income does have important implications for income distribution. In
the preceding chapters, we discussed profit as a return to a productive factor: Capital, like labor, is
productive and has a marginal product. However, Marx attributed all value to labor and none to
capital. According to Marx’s labor theory of value, the value of any commodity depends only on
the amount of labor needed to produce it. The owners of capital are able to extract profit, or “sur-
plus value,”because labor creates more value in a day than it is paid for. Like any other good, labor
power is worth only what it takes to “produce” it. In simple words, this means that under capital-
ism, labor is paid a subsistence wage.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Marx saw profit as an illegitimate expropriation by capitalists of the fruits of labor’s efforts.
It follows that Marxians see the property income component of income distribution as the pri-
mary source of inequality in the United States today. Without capital income, the distribution of
income would be more equal. (Refer again to Table 18.1 on p. 370.)
Income Distribution as a Public Good
Those who argue that the unfettered market
produces a just income distribution do not believe private charity should be forbidden.Voluntary
redistribution does not involve any violation of property rights by the state.
In Chapter 16, however, you saw that there may be a problem with private charity. Suppose
people really do want to end the hunger problem. As they write their checks to charity, they
encounter the classic public-goods problem. First, there are free riders. If hunger and starvation
are eliminated, the benefits—even the merely psychological benefits—flow to everyone whether
they contributed or not. Second, any contribution is a drop in the bucket. One individual contri-
bution is so small that it can have no real effect.
With private charity, as with national defense, nothing depends on whether you pay. Thus,
private charity may fail for the same reason that the private sector is likely to fail to produce
national defense and other public goods. People will find it in their interest not to contribute.
Thus, we turn to government to provide goods and services we want that will not be provided
adequately if we act separately—in this case, help for the poor and hungry.
Redistribution Programs and Policies
The role of government in changing the distribution of income is hotly debated. The debate
involves not only what government programs are appropriate to fight poverty but also the char-
acter of the tax system. Unfortunately, the quality of the public debate on the subject is low.
Usually, the debate consists of a series of claims and counterclaims about what social programs
do to incentives instead of a serious inquiry into what our distributional goal should be.
In this section, we talk about the tools of redistribution policy in the United States. As we do
so, you will have a chance to assess for yourself some of the evidence about their effects.
Financing Redistribution Programs: Taxes
Redistribution always involves those who end up with less and those who end up with more.
Because redistributional programs are financed by tax dollars, it is important to know who the
donors and recipients are—who pays the taxes and who receives the benefits of those taxes. The
issue of which households bear the burden of the taxes collected by government is quite complex
and requires some analysis. Oftentimes households, firms, and markets react to the presence of
taxes in ways that shift burdens off of those on whom they were intended to fall and onto others.
A perfect example is the corporation tax. At both the federal and state levels in most states, a
special tax is levied on corporations in proportion to their profit or net income. Although this tax
is levied on certain firms, the burden ultimately falls on households in one or more of a number
of ways. The tax may result in higher prices for corporate products. The tax may result in lower
wages for corporate employees, or the tax may result in lower profits for owners/shareholders of
corporations. The ultimate impact of a tax, or set of taxes, on the distribution of income depends
on which households end up bearing the burden after shifting has taken place.
The term incidence refers to the ultimate burden distribution of a tax. Chapter 19 illustrates
the way in which economic analysis can be used to estimate the ultimate incidence of taxes.
The mainstay of the U.S. tax system is the individual income tax, authorized in 1913 by the
Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The income tax is progressive—those with higher
incomes pay a higher percentage of their incomes in taxes. Even though the tax is subject to many
exemptions, deductions, and so on that allow some taxpayers to reduce their tax burdens, all stud-
ies of the income tax show that its burden as a percentage of income rises as income rises.
With the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress initiated a major change in income
tax rates and regulations. The reforms were to simplify the tax and make it easier for people to
comply with and harder to avoid. In addition, the act reduced the number of tax brackets and the
overall progressivity of the rates. The largest reduction was in the top rate, cut from 50 percent to
28 percent in 1986. The Act also substantially reduced the tax burdens of those at the very bottom
by increasing the amount of income a person can earn before paying any tax at all.

CHAPTER 18
Income Distribution and Poverty 381
In 1993, President Clinton signed into law a tax bill that increased the top rate to 36 percent
for families with taxable incomes over $140,000 and individuals with taxable incomes over
$115,000. In addition, families with incomes of over $250,000 paid a surtax (a tax rate on a tax
rate) of 10 percent, bringing the marginal rate for those families to 39.6 percent. Families with
low incomes received grants and credits under the plan. On May 28, 2003, President Bush signed
a tax law that reduced the top rate to 35 percent and changed a number of other provisions of the
tax code. (See Chapter 19 for details.)
The individual income tax is only one tax among many. More important to the individual is
the overall burden of taxation, including all federal, state, and local taxes. Most studies of the
effect of taxes on the distribution of income, both before and after the Tax Reform Act, have con-
cluded that the overall burden is roughly proportional. In other words, all people pay about the
same percentage of their income in total taxes.
Table 18.6 presents an estimate of effective tax rates paid in 2000 by families that have been
ranked by income. Although some progressivity is visible, it is very slight. The bottom 20 percent
of the income earners pay 28 percent of their total incomes in tax. The top 1 percent pay 37.0 per-
cent. We can conclude from these data that the tax side of the equation produces very little
change in the distribution of income. (For more on taxes, see Chapter 19.)

Expenditure Programs
Some programs designed to redistribute income or to aid the poor provide cash income to recip-
ients. Others provide benefits in the form of health care, subsidized housing, or food stamps. Still
others provide training or help workers find jobs.
Social Security
By far the largest income redistribution program in the United States is Social
Security. The Social Security system is three programs financed through separate trust funds. The
Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) program, the largest of the three, pays cash benefits to retired
workers, their survivors, and their dependents. The Disability Insurance (DI) program pays cash ben-
efits to disabled workers and their dependents. The third, Health Insurance (HI), or Medicare, pro-
vides medical benefits to workers covered by OASI and DI and the railroad retirement program. The
Social Security system has been credited with substantially reducing poverty among the elderly.
Most workers in the United States must participate in the Social Security system. For many
years,federal employees and employees belonging to certain state and municipal retirement systems
were not required to participate, but federal employees are now being brought into the system.
Today, well over 90 percent of all workers in the United States contribute to Social Security.
Participants and their employers are required to pay a payroll tax to the Federal Insurance
Corporation Association (FICA) to finance the Social Security system. The tax in 2008 was 7.65 per-
cent paid by employers and 7.65 percent paid by employees on wages up to $102,000. Self-employed
people assume the entire FICA burden themselves.
You are entitled to Social Security benefits if you participate in the system for 10 years.
Benefits are paid monthly to you after you retire or, if you die, to your survivors. A complicated
formula based on your average salary while you were paying into the system determines your
benefit level. Those who earned more receive a higher level of benefits, but there are maximum
and minimum monthly benefits. By and large, low-salaried workers get more out of the system

than they paid into it while they were working. High-salaried workers usually get out of the sys-
tem considerably less than they put in.
The Social Security system is self-financing, but it is different from funded retirement sys-
tems. In a funded system, deposits (by the employer, the employee, or both) are made to an
account in the employee’s name. Those funds are invested and earn interest or dividends that
accumulate until the employee’s retirement, when they are withdrawn. Funded retirement plans
operate very much like a savings plan that you might set up independently, except that you can-
not touch the contents until you retire.
In the U.S. Social Security system, the tax receipts from today’s workers are used to pay bene-
fits to retired and disabled workers and their dependents today. Currently, the system is collecting
more than it is paying out, and the excess is accumulating in the trust funds. This is necessary to
keep the system solvent because after the year 2010, there will be a large increase in the number of
retirees and a relative decline in the number of workers. These demographic changes are the result
of a high birth rate between 1946 and 1964—the so-called baby boom. In 2007, 31.5 million
retired workers received Social Security benefits and 7.1 million received disability payments.
Public Assistance
Next to Social Security, the biggest cash transfer program in the United
States is public assistance, more commonly called welfare. Aimed specifically at the poor, wel-
fare falls into two major categories.
Most welfare is paid in the form of temporary assistance for needy families. Benefit levels are
set by the states, and they vary widely. In January 2003, the maximum monthly payment to a one-
parent family of three was $170 per month in Mississippi, $639 per month in Vermont, and $923
per month in Alaska. The average monthly payment in the United States was $423. To participate,
a family must have a very low income and virtually no assets. In 2002, there were 5.1 million
recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families in the United States. Those who find jobs
and enter the labor force lose benefits quickly as their incomes rise. This loss of benefits acts as a
tax on beneficiaries, and some argue that it discourages welfare recipients from seeking jobs.
No topics raise passions more than welfare and welfare reform. The issue has been a focal
point of “liberal/conservative” name-calling for more than three decades. In 1996, Congress
passed and President Clinton signed a major overhaul of the welfare system in the United States.
The name of the program was changed to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families from its for-
mer name, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, as of July 1997. The key change mandated
that states limit most recipients to no more than five years of benefits over a lifetime. Some argue
that the result will be a disaster, with some families left with nothing. Others argue that the previ-
ous system led to dependency and that there was no incentive to work.
The new legislation provides funds for added services to parents with young children but
leaves a great deal of discretion in states’ hands. Only time will tell how it turns out. However,
remarkable declines in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF) caseloads
occurred between 1994 and 2001. At the end of that year, the average monthly number of TANF
recipients was 5.5 million, or 56 percent lower than the Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC) caseload in 1996. From its peak of 14.4 million in March 1994, the number dropped by
64.6 percent to 5.1 million in 2002. Over three-fourths of the reduction in the U.S. average
monthly number of recipients since March 1994 occurred following implementation of TANF.
These are the largest caseload declines in the history of U.S. public assistance programs.
Supplemental Security Income
The Supplemental Security Income program (SSI) is a
federal program that was set up under the Social Security Administration in 1974. The program
is financed out of general revenues. That is, there is no trust fund and there are no earmarked
taxes from which SSI benefits are paid out.
SSI is designed to take care of the elderly who end up very poor and have no or very low
Social Security entitlement. In 2009, 8 million people received SSI payments, about half of whom
also received some Social Security benefits. The average SSI payment was $498 per month. As
with welfare, qualified recipients must have very low incomes and virtually no assets.
Unemployment Compensation
In the first quarter of 2005, governments paid out over
$9.5 billion in benefits to 3.3 million recipients. The money to finance this benefit comes from
taxes paid by employers into special funds. Companies that hire and fire frequently pay a higher
tax rate, while companies with relatively stable employment levels pay a lower tax rate. Tax and
benefit levels are determined by the states, within certain federal guidelines.

CHAPTER 18
Income Distribution and Poverty 383
Workers who qualify for unemployment compensation begin to receive benefit checks
soon after they are laid off. These checks continue for a period specified by the state. Most
unemployment benefits continue for 20 weeks. In times of recession, the benefit period is often
extended on a state-by-state basis. Average unemployed workers receive only about 36 percent of
their normal wages, and not all workers are covered. To qualify for benefits, an unemployed per-
son must have worked recently for a covered employer for a specified time for a given amount of
wages. Recipients must also demonstrate willingness and ability to seek and accept suitable
employment.
Unemployment benefits are not aimed at the poor alone, although many of the unemployed
are poor. Unemployment benefits are paid regardless of a person’s income from other sources
and regardless of assets.
Health Care: Medicaid and Medicare
The largest in-kind transfer programs in the
United States are Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicaid program provides health and hospitaliza-
tion benefits to people with low incomes. Although the program is administered by the states,
about 57 percent of the cost is borne by the federal government. In fiscal year 2011, the federal
share was budgeted at $271 billion and growing rapidly. Both the federal share and the shares of
each state are paid out of general revenue sources such as the income tax or the sales tax depend-
ing on the state.
Medicare, which is run by the Social Security Administration, is a health insurance program
for the aged and certain disabled persons. Most U.S. citizens over age 65 receive Medicare hospi-
tal insurance coverage regardless of their income. In addition, Medicare recipients are able to
purchase supplemental policies that cover things like the cost of prescription drugs.
Medicare is financed with the revenues from the Social Security payroll tax discussed above.
Of the 7.65 percent flat rate tax paid by individuals who receive wages and salaries and an equal
amount paid by their employers, 1.45 percent goes to Medicare. The self employed pay both
halves or 15.3 percent. While the Social Security taxes apply only to income over a certain maxi-
mum, the Medicare tax is paid on all income without a cap. In fiscal year 2011, over $500 billion
was budgeted for Medicare benefits payable to nearly 50 million recipients.
A major problem facing the system is the aging of the baby boom generation. The oldest of
the baby boomers are now approaching the age of 65. Thus, a substantial number of people will be
eligible for Medicare benefits precisely during the years that they are likely to need them.
Projections are that the payroll tax will be insufficient to cover benefits and the system will be
insolvent by the year 2020.
Despite the significant resources spent by the government, the Census Bureau reports that
the number of people without health insurance grew to 50.7 million in 2009 from 46.3 million in
2008. The number of people covered by private insurance dropped during this period.
During the first term of the Obama administration the President put forward a major
package of health care reform legislation. The Congress passed the Affordable Care Act bill
by a razor thin vote in March 2010. The bill was designed to bring the United States closer to
universal coverage by mandating that everyone buy health insurance coverage and setting up
a government sponsored plan. The bill also made it illegal to drop coverage of people who
become ill or deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions. The bill is very complex
and it will take years to phase in. In addition, there was a great deal of public opposition to
the reforms voiced during the mid-term elections of 2010. Much of the political opposition
focused on the potential cost which would have to be added to an already high federal bud-
get deficit.
Food Stamps
The Food Stamp program is an antipoverty program fully funded out of gen-
eral federal tax revenues, with states bearing 50 percent of the program’s administrative costs.
Food stamps are vouchers that have a face value greater than their cost and that can be used to
purchase food at grocery stores. The amount by which the face value of the stamps exceeds their
cost depends on income and family size. Only low-income families and single people are eligible to
receive food stamps.
It is generally acknowledged that a thriving black market in food stamps exists. Families that
want or need cash can sell their food stamps to people who will buy them for less than face value
but more than the original recipient paid for them.
In 2009, there were 40 million participants in the Food Stamp program. The total cost of the
program in 2009 was $54 billion.

Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Does Price Matter in Charitable Giving?
In the United States, one of the ways in which people try to help the
poor is through charity. Almost 90 percent of the population con-
tributes each year to some charitable organization. Recent work in
experimental economics has explored the factors that lead people to
make these contributions. In experimental economics, experiments
are conducted in a laboratory or in the field by using control groups
to test economic theories. In some cases, the lessons learned have
been put to use by charities as they try to raise funds.
One set of experiments looks at the effect of a matching gift on
giving.1 A matching gift is a commitment by a donor to give funds
conditioned on another person’s donation. A donor might say, for
example,“For every dollar you raise up to $20,000, I will match with
a dollar of my own.”Why might an economist expect a matching gift
commitment to increase the likelihood that another person will give
to the charity?
There are at least two plausible explanations. In the previous chap-
ter of this book, we described signals. In this situation, by offering a
matching gift, in a public way, the original donor is telling other
potential donors that he or she believes the charity to be worthy. If the
donor is a well-known member of the community, this signal can be a
powerful incentive to other givers.
Suppose that we think of “giving to charity” the same way we
think of buying a good or a service. That is, we do it because we
derive “utility” from it. If we do donate to charity, we are giving up
the other things that the donation would buy. Now think of the “price
of giving” as the amount you need to pay to deliver $10 in aid to a
charity. With the matching grant, the price of giving falls to $5. If you
give $5, the charity gets $10. If you give $100, the charity gets $200. So
matching gifts are like reducing the “price” of a charitable gift.
Under the U.S. Income Tax, many taxpayers can deduct gifts to
qualifying charities from their income in calculating their taxes
each year. Suppose that a taxpayer were taxed at a marginal rate of
25 percent. Then a gift of $100 results in a tax saving of $25. The
deduction reduces income by $100, and that $100 would have been
taxed at 25 percent. Thus, just as in the case of the matching grant,
the “price of giving” is reduced, in this case the price of giving 
$100 is reduced to $75. With deductibility, we reduce the price of
charity from P to P (1 - t ) where t is the tax rate that applies to
increases or decreases in income. Do you see why?
Whether a reduction in “price” leads people to give more
depends on a lot of things. If it is a matching grant, you may give less
and deliver more charity due to the match or you may give more to
take advantage of the match. In the Karlan and List experiments,
matching gift programs increased rates of giving.

Housing Programs
Over the years, the federal government and state governments have
administered many different housing programs designed to improve the quality of housing for
low-income people. The biggest is the Public Housing program, financed by the federal govern-
ment but administered by local public housing authorities. Public housing tenants pay rents
equal to no more than 30 percent of their incomes. In many cases, this means they pay nothing.
The largest housing program, called “Section 8,” provides housing assistance payments to tenants
and slightly above-market rent guarantees to participating landlords.
In 2003, there were 33.5 million rental housing units in the United States, of which 1.9 mil-
lion were in public housing projects. Another 2.2 million received a government rent subsidy.
The Earned Income Tax Credit
An important program that is not well understood by
most people is the earned income tax credit (EIC). The program is quite complex but essentially
allows lower-income families with children a credit equal to a percentage of all wage and salary
income against their income taxes. If the credit exceeds the amount of taxes due, the credit is
refundable. To see roughly how the EIC works, consider a family made up of two adults and two
children with an income of $11,000 per year, all earned as wages. After the standard deduction
and exemptions, such a family would owe no taxes, but it would receive (subject to a number of
restrictions) refundable credit of up to $3,800. That means the family would actually get a check
for $3,800.
While not well known, the EIC program is very large. In 2009, the EIC was claimed by over
25 million households and totaled more than $57 billion.

Government or the Market? A Review
In Part II (Chapter 6 to 12), you were introduced to the behavior of households and firms in
input and output markets. You learned that if all the assumptions of perfect competition held in
the real world, the outcome would be perfectly efficient.
As we began to relax the assumptions of perfect competition in Part III (Chapter 13 to
Chapter 19), we began to see a potential role for government in the economy. Some firms acquire
market power and tend to underproduce and overprice. Unregulated markets give private deci-
sion makers no incentives to weigh the social costs of externalities. Goods that provide collective
benefits may not be produced in sufficient quantities without government involvement. As we
saw in this chapter, the final distribution of well-being determined by the unfettered market may
not be considered equitable by society.
Remember, however, that government is not a cure for all economic woes. There is no guar-
antee that public-sector involvement will improve matters. Many argue that government involve-
ment may bring about even more inequity and inefficiency because bureaucrats are often driven
by self-interest, not public interest.
CHAPTER 18
Income Distribution and Poverty 385
THE SOURCES OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME p. 367 
1. Households derive their incomes from three basic sources:
(1) from wages or salaries received in exchange for labor (about
64 percent), (2) from property such as capital and land (about
22 percent), and (3) from government (about 14 percent).
2. Differences in wage and salary incomes across households
result from differences in the characteristics of workers
(skills, training, education, experience, and so on) and from
differences in jobs (dangerous, exciting, glamorous, difficult,
and so on). Household income also varies with the number
of household members in the labor force, and it can decline
sharply if members become unemployed.
3. The amount of property income that a household earns
depends on the amount and kinds of property it owns.
Transfer income from governments flows substantially but
not exclusively to lower-income households. Except for
Social Security, transfer payments are by and large designed
to provide income to those in need.
THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME p. 370
4. The 20 percent of families at the top of the income distribu-
tion received 50.5 percent of the money income in the
United States in 2006, while the bottom 20 percent earned
just 3.4 percent. Income distribution in the United States has
remained basically stable over a long period of time.
5. The Lorenz curve is a commonly used graphic device for
describing the distribution of income. The Gini coefficient is
an index of income inequality that ranges from 0 for perfect
equality to 1 for total inequality.
6. Poverty is very difficult to define. Nonetheless, the official
poverty line in the United States is fixed at three times the
cost of the Department of Agriculture’s minimum food bud-
get. In 2006, the poverty line for a family of four was $17,628.
7. Between 1960 and 1970, the number of people officially clas-
sified as poor fell from 40 million to 25 million. That num-
ber did not change much between 1970 and 1978. Between
1978 and 1983, the number of poor people increased by
nearly 45 percent to 35.3 million. In 2006, the figure was
36.5 million.
8. Data on the distribution of wealth are not as readily avail-
able as data on the distribution of income. The distribution
of wealth in the United States is more unequal than the dis-
tribution of income. The wealthiest 10 percent of house-
holds own just under 70 percent of all household net worth
in 2004.
THE UTILITY POSSIBILITIES FRONTIER p. 376 
9. Even if all markets were perfectly efficient, the result might
not be fair. Even in relatively unfettered market economies,
governments redistribute income and wealth, usually in the
name of fairness, or equity.
10. Because utility is neither directly observable nor measurable,
most policy discussions deal with the distributions of
income and wealth as imperfect substitutes for the concept
of “the distribution of well-being.”
THE REDISTRIBUTION DEBATE p. 377
11. The basic philosophical argument against government redis-
tribution rests on the proposition that one is entitled to the
fruits of one’s efforts. The argument also rests on the princi-
ples of freedom of contract and protection of property rights.
More common arguments focus on the negative effects of
redistribution on incentives to work, save, and invest.
12. The basic philosophical argument in favor of redistribution
is that a society as rich as the United States has a moral
obligation to provide all its members with the basic necessi-
ties of life. More formal arguments can be found in the
works of the utilitarians, Rawls, and Marx.
REDISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AND POLICIES p. 380 
13. In the United States, redistribution is accomplished through
taxation and through a number of government transfer pro-
grams. The largest of these programs are Social Security,
public assistance, supplemental security, unemployment com-
pensation, Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps, and various
housing subsidy programs (including public housing).
14. The increase in poverty during the 1980s and 1990s is at the
center of a great debate over the effectiveness of antipoverty
programs. One view holds that the best way to cure poverty

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
1. One of the issues that is debated in virtually every election is
whether to raise the federal minimum wage, which stood at $7.25
per hour in 2010. Suppose that you are married with a child,
working a 40 hour week in a minimum wage job. By assuming
that you pay taxes of about 10 percent of your total pay, how
much do you “take home” each month? How much does it cost to
rent a “reasonable” apartment near where you live? How much
would you have left after paying rent? How much would it cost
for other items such as food? Work out a hypothetical “budget”
for this family.
2. By using the data in the following table, create two graphs. The first
graph should plot the Lorenz curves for African-American families
and white families. The second graph should plot the Lorenz curve
for the 1980 “all”data and the Lorenz curve for the 1995 “all”data.
In each graph, which has the higher Gini coefficient? How
do you interpret the result?
3. Economists call education “an investment in human capital.”
Define capital. In what sense is education capital?
Investments are undertaken to earn a rate of return. Describe
the return to an investment in a college education. How would
you go about measuring it? How would you decide if it is good
enough to warrant the investment?

5. During the mid-1980s and again between 1995 and 2006,
house values and rents rose sharply in California and in the
northeastern United States. But starting in 2006, prices began
to fall. Homeowners, who have higher incomes on average than
renters, benefit from house-price increases and are protected
from housing-cost increases. Falling house prices, on the other
hand, make housing more affordable but inflict pain on home-
owners. Renters experience rising rents and falling standards of
living if incomes do not keep up with rents. Using the

agree? Explain your answer.

law that sets the minimum wage in this market at $14.00 per

compensation remains a much-debated topic in the United
States. Over the past three decades, compensation for CEOs of
U.S. corporations has risen dramatically, both in real dollars and
in terms of worker’s earnings, where in 1980 the average CEO of
a major corporation earned 42 times the average pay of an
hourly worker. The debate has reached Washington, where in
2009 President Obama imposed a pay limit of $500,000 for
executives of companies that received federal bailout money.
Write a brief essay discussing executive compensation, explain-
ing whether you believe executive pay should be limited. Should
the government be involved in compensation decisions of pri-
vate corporations? What has happened to the ratio of CEO pay
to hourly worker pay since 1980, and how does this compare to
other countries?

CHAPTER OUTLINE
389
Public Finance: The
Economics of
Taxation
The previous chapters in Part III
have analyzed the potential role of
government in the economy.
Together those chapters discuss
much of
the field of
public
economics. In this chapter, we make
the transition to public finance. No
matter what functions we end up
assigning to government, to do
anything at all, government must
first raise revenues. The primary
vehicle that the government uses to
finance itself is taxation.
Taxes may be imposed on
transactions, institutions, property,
meals, and other things, but in the final analysis they are paid by individuals or households.
The Economics of Taxation
To begin our analysis of the U.S. tax system, we need to clarify some terms. There are many kinds
of taxes and tax analysts use a specific language to describe them.
Taxes: Basic Concepts
Every tax has two parts: a base and a rate structure. The tax base is the measure or value upon which
the tax is levied. In the United States, taxes are levied on a variety of bases, including income, sales,
property, and corporate profits. The tax rate structure determines the portion of the tax base that
must be paid in taxes. A tax rate of 25 percent on income, for example, means that you pay a tax
equal to 25 percent of your income.
Taxes on Stocks versus Taxes on Flows
Tax bases may be either stock measures or
flow measures. The local property tax is a tax on the value of residential, commercial, or indus-
trial property. A homeowner, for instance, is taxed on the current assessed value of his or her
home. Current value is a stock variable—that is, it is measured or estimated at a point in time.
Other taxes are levied on flows. Income is a flow. Most people are paid on a monthly basis, and
they have taxes taken out every month. Retail sales take place continuously, and a retail sales tax takes
a portion of that flow. Figure 19.1 diagrams in simple form the important continuous payment flows
between households and firms and the points at which the government levies six different taxes.
Although the individual income tax remained around 45 percent of total taxes through 2000,
by 2009 it was down to 37.2 percent. The corporate tax has been around 10 percent since 1990.
There has been a huge increase in the share of the social insurance tax, from 16.0 percent in 1960
to 42.7 percent in 2009. It is now the largest component of federal tax receipts.

Most taxes are levied on measurable economic flows. For example, a profits, or net income, tax is levied on
the annual profits earned by corporations.
regressive tax
A tax whose
burden, expressed as a
percentage of income, falls as
income increases.
proportional tax
A tax whose
burden is the same proportion
of income for all households.
progressive tax
A tax whose
burden, expressed as a
percentage of income,
increases as income increases.
Proportional, Progressive, and Regressive Taxes
All taxes are ultimately paid out
of income. A tax whose burden is the same proportion of income for all households is a
proportional tax. A tax of 20 percent on all forms of income, with no deductions or exclusions,
is a proportional tax.
A tax that exacts a higher percentage of income from higher-income households than from
lower-income households is a progressive tax. Because its rate structure increases with income,
the U.S. individual income tax is a progressive tax. Under current law, a family with a taxable
income of under $14,000 would pay a tax of 10 percent while a family with an income of
$100,000 would pay about 19 percent.
A tax that exacts a lower percentage of income from higher-income families than from
lower-income families is a regressive tax. Excise taxes (taxes on specific commodities such as
gasoline and telephone calls) are regressive. The retail sales tax is also a regressive tax. Suppose

CHAPTER 19
Public Finance: The Economics of Taxation 391
the retail sales tax in your state is 5 percent. You might assume that it is a proportional tax
because everyone pays 5 percent. But all people do not spend the same fraction of their
income on taxable goods and services. In fact, higher-income households save a larger frac-
tion of their incomes. Even though they spend more on expensive things and may pay more
taxes in dollars than lower-income families, they end up paying a smaller proportion of their
incomes in sales tax.
Table 19.2 shows this principle at work in three families. The lowest-income family saves
20 percent of its $10,000 income, leaving $8,000 for consumption. With a hypothetical 5 percent
sales tax, the household pays $400, or 4 percent of total income, in tax. The $50,000 family saves
50 percent of its income, or $25,000, leaving $25,000 for consumption. With the 5 percent sales
tax, the household pays $1,250, only 2.5 percent of its total income, in tax.
Marginal versus Average Tax Rates
When discussing a specific tax or taxes in general,
we should distinguish between average tax rate and marginal tax rates. Your average tax rate is
the total amount of tax you pay divided by your total income. If you earned a total income of
$15,000 and paid income taxes of $1,500, your average income tax rate would be 10 percent
($1,500 divided by $15,000). If you paid $3,000 in taxes, your average rate would be 20 percent
($3,000 divided by $15,000). Your marginal tax rate is the tax rate you pay on any additional
income you earn.
Each year you must file a tax return with the Internal Revenue Service on or before April 15.
On that form, you first figure out the total tax you are responsible for paying. Next, you deter-
mine how much was withheld from your income and sent to the IRS by your employer. If too
much was withheld, you get a refund; if not enough was withheld, you have to write a check to
the government for the difference.
In figuring out the total amount of tax you must pay, you first add up all your income. You are
then allowed to subtract certain items from it. Among the things that virtually all taxpayers can sub-
tract are the personal exemption and the standard deduction.After everything is subtracted, you are left
with taxable income. Taxable income is then subject to a set of marginal rates that rise with income.
The Economics in Practice on p. 392 shows the income taxes that would be paid by two hypo-
thetical single people earning $100,000 and $125,000, respectively. The discussion uses the actual
2009 U.S. tax rates.These calculations show that average and marginal tax rates are not the same
in a progressive tax system. Which tax rate should you pay attention to? When talking about
taxes, many people focus on average rates, the percent of one’s income that goes to the govern-
ment. But for most decisions, the marginal rate is more relevant. If you are thinking of working
more hours, you will be paying the marginal (higher) rate on the incremental income earned; so
that is the rate you should look at in thinking about whether to work. In thinking about whether
to donate money (which has the effect of lowering adjusted income), the marginal rate is again
the relevant one.
How Much Does a Deduction Save You in Taxes?
As you saw in the Economics in
Practice, you were allowed to subtract $9,350 from your income as a single person before calculat-
ing taxes. However, you may be able to do better (that is, pay less tax) if you can come up with
“itemized deductions” in excess of $9,350. Taxpayers may deduct income taxes paid to a state,
charitable contributions to qualifying organizations, real estate taxes, and interest paid on a
mortgage to finance the purchase of a home, as well as other items.
Some people complain that high-income households receive a bigger benefit from deduc-
tions. For example, if a single person with very high income—let’s say over $400,000—gave a

contribution of $1,000, she would save $350 because her marginal tax rate is 35 percent, the high-
est marginal tax rate. If another person had a taxable income of $20,000, the same $1,000
charitable contribution would save her only $150 because she would face a marginal tax rate of
15 percent. You can see that higher income households, facing higher marginal tax rates, have
more incentives to seek deductions of various sorts.
This discussion gives you a taste of the U.S. Individual Income Tax. It is a very complex tax,
and most people need help in figuring out how to comply with the law. One of the top priorities
of each of the past five U.S. presidents has been to simplify the tax code, and while the Tax Reform
Act of 1986 made some progress, the code seems to get more complex with every passing year.
Shortly after being elected, President Obama appointed a task force headed by Paul Volcker to
streamline the tax code.
Tax Equity
One of the criteria for evaluating the economy that we defined in Chapter 1 (and returned to in
Chapter 18) was fairness, or equity. Everyone agrees that tax burdens should be distributed fairly,
that all of us should pay our “fair share” of taxes, but there is endless debate about what consti-
tutes a fair tax system.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Calculating Taxes
One way to get a sense of the structure of the U.S. income tax system
is to actually calculate what you would owe assuming your income
was at one level or another. Suppose you are single with no depen-
dents and you rent rather than own. Assume your charitable contri-
butions are relatively modest as well. In that case, you are likely to
take a “standard deduction” when filing your taxes.
Consider what happens to your tax payments as you go from
$100,000 per year to $125,000. We will use the 2009 tax schedule for
this calculation. In 2009, single filers who were not claimed on any-
one else’s tax return (many students are still claimed on their
parents’ returns) and did not itemize were entitled to deduct $9,350
from their gross income before calculating their taxes. In our exam-
ple, we will be comparing adjusted incomes of $90,650 versus
$115,650. Notice that both before and after this adjustment the pre-
tax incomes differ by $25,000.
The 2009 tax table is reproduced below. As you see, the tax rate
increases with income, making it a progressive system. In the last two
columns we calculate the taxes owed at the two income levels.
Notice your average tax rate goes up with income given that the
tax system is progressive. Notice also that the marginal tax rate of
28 percent is higher than the average tax rate. Of the added $25,000
you earn, 28 percent goes to the government, and you net only
$18,000 more than you had at a salary level of $100,000. (If you do
the subtraction, you will see that your after-tax pay at $100,000 is
$80,898, while at $125,000 it is $98,898.)

CHAPTER 19
Public Finance: The Economics of Taxation 393
One theory of fairness is called the benefits-received principle. Dating back to the eighteenth-
century economist Adam Smith and earlier writers, the benefits-received principle holds that taxpay-
ers should contribute to government according to the benefits they derive from public expenditures.
This principle ties the tax side of the fiscal equation to the expenditure side. For example, the owners
and users of cars pay gasoline and automotive excise taxes, which are paid into the Federal Highway
Trust Fund to build and maintain the federal highway system.The beneficiaries of public highways are
thus taxed in rough proportion to their use of those highways.
The difficulty with applying the benefits principle is that many public expenditures are for
public goods—national defense, for example. The benefits of public goods fall collectively on all
members of society, and there is no way to determine what value individual taxpayers receive
from them.
A different principle, and one that has dominated the formulation of tax policy in the United
States for decades, is the ability-to-pay principle. This principle holds that taxpayers should bear
tax burdens in line with their ability to pay. Here the tax side of the fiscal equation is viewed sep-
arately from the expenditure side. Under this system, the problem of attributing the benefits of
public expenditures to specific taxpayers or groups of taxpayers is avoided.
Horizontal and Vertical Equity
If we accept the idea that ability to pay should be the
basis for the distribution of tax burdens, two principles follow. First, the principle of horizontal
equity holds that those with equal ability to pay should bear equal tax burdens. Second, the prin-
ciple of vertical equity holds that those with greater ability to pay should pay more.
Although these notions seem appealing, we must have answers to two interdependent ques-
tions before they can be meaningful. First, how is ability to pay measured? What is the “best” tax
base? Second, if A has a greater ability to pay than B, how much more should A contribute?
What Is the “Best” Tax Base?
The three leading candidates for best tax base are income, consumption, and wealth. Before we
consider each as a basis for taxation, let us see what they mean.
Income—to be precise, economic income—is anything that enhances your ability to com-
mand resources. The technical definition of economic income is the value of what you consume
plus any change in the value of what you own:
This broad definition is essentially consumption + saving, but it includes many items
not counted by the Internal Revenue Service and some items the Census Bureau does not
include in its definition of “money income.” Economic income includes all money receipts,
whether from employment, interest on savings, dividends, profits, or transfers from the gov-
ernment. It also includes the value of benefits not received in money form, such as medical
benefits, employer retirement contributions, paid country club memberships, and so on.
Increases or decreases in the value of stocks or bonds, whether or not they are “realized”
through sale, are part of economic income. For income tax purposes, capital gains (increases
in the value of assets, like shares of stock) count as income only when they are realized, but
for purposes of defining economic income, all increases in asset values count, whether they
are realized or not.
A few other items that we do not usually think of as income are included in a comprehensive
definition of income. If you own your house outright and live in it rent free, income flows from
your house just as interest flows from a bond or profit from a share of stock. By owning the
house, you enjoy valuable housing benefits for which you would otherwise have to pay rent. You
are your own landlord, and you are, in essence, earning your own rent. Other components of eco-
nomic income include any gifts and bequests received and food grown at home. In economic
terms, income is income regardless of source and use.
Consumption is the total value of goods and services that a household consumes in a given period.
Wealth, or net worth, is the value of all the goods and services you own after your liabilities
are subtracted. If today you were to sell everything of value you own—stocks, bonds, houses, cars,

Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
and so on—at their current market prices and pay off all your debts—loans, mortgages, and so
on—you would end up with your net worth.
Remember, income and consumption are flow measures. We speak of income per month or
per year. Wealth and net worth are stock measures at a point in time.
For years, conventional wisdom among economists held that income was the best measure of
ability to pay taxes. Many who believe that consumption is a better measure have recently chal-
lenged that assumption. The following arguments are not just arguments about fairness and abil-
ity to pay; they are also arguments about the best base for taxation.
Remember as you proceed that the issue is which base is the best base,not which tax is the best tax
or whether taxes ought to be progressive or regressive. Sales taxes are regressive, but it is possible to
have a personal consumption tax that is progressive. Under such a system, individuals would report
their income as they do now, but all documented saving would be deductible. The difference between
income and saving is a measure of personal consumption that could be taxed with progressive rates.
Consumption as the Best Tax Base
The view favoring consumption as the best tax base
dates back to at least the seventeenth-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who argued
that people should pay taxes in accordance with “what they actually take out of the common pot,
not what they leave in.” The standard of living, the argument goes, depends not on income, but on
how much income is spent. If we want to redistribute well-being, therefore, the tax base should be
consumption because consumption is the best measure of well-being. The value-added tax (VAT)
used by most developed economies other than the United States is essentially a tax on consumption.
A second argument with a distinguished history dates back to work done by Irving Fisher in
the early part of the last century. Fisher and many others have argued that a tax on income discour-
ages saving by taxing savings twice. A story told originally by Fisher illustrates this theory nicely.1
Suppose Alex builds a house for Frank. In exchange, Frank pays Alex $10,000 and gives him
an orchard containing 100 apple trees. Alex spends the $10,000 today, but he saves the orchard,
and presumably he will consume or sell the fruit it bears every year in the future.At year’s end, the
state levies a 10 percent tax on Alex’s total income, which includes the $10,000 and the orchard.
First, the government takes 10 percent of the $10,000, which is 10 percent of Alex’s consumption.
Second, it takes 10 percent of the orchard—10 trees—which is 10 percent of Alex’s saving. If this
is all the government did, there would be no double taxation of saving. If, however, the income
tax is also levied the following year, Alex will be taxed on the income generated by the 90 trees
that he still owns. If the income tax is levied in the year after that, Alex will again be taxed on the
income generated by his orchard, and so on. The income tax is thus taxing Alex’s saving more
than once. To tax the orchard fairly, the system should take 10 percent of the trees or 10 percent of
the fruit going forward—but not both! To avoid the double taxation of savings, either the original
savings of 100 trees should not be taxed or the income generated from the after-tax number of
trees (90) should not be taxed.
The same logic can be applied to cash savings. Suppose the income tax rate is 25 percent and you
earn $20,000. Out of the $20,000, you consume $16,000 and save $4,000. At the end of the year, you
owe the government 25 percent of your total income,or $5,000.You can think of this as a tax of 25 per-
cent on consumption ($4,000) and 25 percent on savings ($1,000). Why, then, do we say that the
income tax is a double tax on savings? To see why, you have to think about the $4,000 that is saved.
If you save $4,000, you will no doubt put it to some use. Saving possibilities include putting
it in an interest-bearing account or buying a bond. If you do either, you will earn interest that you
can consume in future years. In fact, when we save and earn interest, we are spreading some of
our present earnings over future years of consumption. Just as the orchard yields future fruit, the
bond yields future interest, which is considered income in the year it is earned and is taxed as
such. The only way you can earn that future interest income is by leaving your money tied up in
the bond or the account. You can consume the $4,000 today, or you can have the future flow of
interest; you can’t have both. Yet both are taxed!
Net worth = Assets - Liabilities

CHAPTER 19
Public Finance: The Economics of Taxation 395
Taxing consumption is also more efficient than taxing income. As you will see later, a tax that
distorts economic choices creates excess burdens. By double-taxing savings, an income tax distorts
the choice between consumption and saving, which is really the choice between present con-
sumption and future consumption. Double-taxing also tends to reduce the saving rate and the
rate of investment—and ultimately the rate of economic growth.
Income as the Best Tax Base
Your ability to pay is your ability to command resources,
and many argue that your income is the best measure of your capacity to command resources
today. According to proponents of income as a tax base, you should be taxed not on what you
actually draw out of the common pot, but rather on the basis of your ability to draw from that
pot. In other words, your decision to save or consume is no different from your decision to buy
apples, to go out for dinner, or to give money to your mother. It is your income that enables you
to do all these things, and it is income that should be taxed, regardless of its sources and regard-
less of how you use it. Saving is just another use of income.
If income is the best measure of ability to pay, the double taxation argument doesn’t hold
true. An income tax taxes savings twice only if consumption is the measure used to gauge a
person’s ability to pay. It does not do so if income is the measure used. Acquisition of the orchard
enhances your ability to pay today; a bountiful crop of fruit enhances your ability to pay when it
is produced. Interest income is no different from any other form of income; it too enhances your
ability to pay. Taxing both is thus fair.
Wealth as the Best Tax Base
Still others argue that the real power to command resources
comes not from any single year’s income, but from accumulated wealth. Aggregate net worth in
the United States is many times larger than aggregate income.
If two people have identical annual incomes of $10,000 but one of them also has an accumu-
lated net worth of $1 million, is it reasonable to argue that these two people have the same ability
to pay or that they should pay equal taxes? Most people would answer no.
Those who promote a wealth-based system also argue that the only real way to redistribute
economic power is to tax the very high concentrations of wealth. Of course, it is important to
note that if income is already taxed, a wealth tax, in essence, taxes the same dollars again.
No Simple Answer
Recall that these arguments are about the definition of “horizontal
equity”: What is the single best measure of ability to pay? In fact, policy debates about the system
of taxes in the United States or in any other country involve much more. Virtually every country
in the world has a system of taxation that taxes all three bases. In the United States, for example,
there are sales and excise taxes (consumption taxes), the Federal Gift and Estate Tax (a wealth
tax), the Individual Income Tax, and the local property tax (another wealth tax).
It is important to point out that for many U.S. taxpayers, the Individual Income Tax is prob-
ably closer to being a consumption tax than an income tax since much of household savings can
be deducted from income before the tax is figured. The tax code (or law) is full of subsidies and
incentives. Among the most significant incentives built into the system are provisions designed to
encourage people to save. For example, an important exclusion from income for purposes of
defining the income tax base is employers’ contributions to employee pension accounts. For many
workers, retirement is in part financed by payments from pension funds. As long as a person is
working, many employers will make deposits or match employee deposits to retirement or pen-
sion accounts. Those contributions are part of a household’s economic income and part of house-
hold savings, but they are not taxed. Recall that income is essentially consumption plus savings
(change in net worth). In addition, deposits to specific kinds of accounts (such as Individual
Retirement Accounts, or IRAs) can be excluded from income for tax purposes. A good portion of
capital gains income (increases in the value of things that a household owns), such as increases in
the value of corporate stocks or houses, is left out of the base or taxed at lower rates.
There is ongoing debate in the United States about whether it would be better to shift toward a
more comprehensive consumption tax. In the fall of 2005, President Bush’s Advisory Panel on Federal
Tax Reform presented its report on reforming and simplifying the nation’s tax code. The commission
stopped short of full implementation of a consumption tax such as a national sales tax or a version of
a national sales tax called a value-added tax (VAT) that is popular in Europe. But the panel did recom-
mend moving to a system that rewards saving and discourages consumption more than the current
one.An important goal of the commission was to recommend ways of simplifying the code.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
The Gift and Estate Tax
One of the oldest and most common forms of taxation in the world is the taxation of property
held by an individual at the time of his or her death. The property owned at the time of a person’s
death is called the person’s estate. An estate tax is a tax on the total value of a person’s estate
regardless of how it is distributed. The United States levies a Gift and Estate Tax on gifts made
over a person’s lifetime and the value of the person’s estate, for estates over a certain level. The
Federal Gift and Estate Tax, which raises less than 2 percent of total tax revenues, was phased out
for one year in 2010 under a law passed by Congress in 2001. In 2011, without further action, the
tax will revert to its original 2001 level. The Economics in Practice discusses the picture in 2010.
Tax Incidence: Who Pays?
When a government levies a tax, it writes a law assigning responsibility for payment to specific
people or specific organizations. To understand a tax, we must look beyond those named in the
law as the initial taxpayers.
First, remember the principle of tax analysis: The burden of a tax is ultimately borne by indi-
viduals or households; institutions such as business firms and colleges have no real taxpaying
capacity. Taxes paid by a firm ultimately fall on customers or owners or workers. Second, the bur-
den of a tax is not always borne by those initially responsible for paying it. Directly or indirectly,
tax burdens are often shifted to others. When we speak of the incidence of a tax, we are referring
to the ultimate distribution of its burden.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
The Yankees and the Estate Tax
As we indicated in the text, under a tax change passed in 2001, the
gift and estate tax was phased out completely in 2010 for one year. By
the fall of 2010, Congress had not yet reversed this phasing out, and
articles began to appear about billionaires who had died in 2010 and
whose heirs appear to have avoided the tax. George Steinbrenner,
legendary owner of the New York Yankees, was one.
How Steinbrenner Saved His Heirs a
$600 Million Tax Bill
The Wall Street Journal
Did George Steinbrenner save his heirs millions by dying
in 2010?
Forbes recently estimated the Yankees owner’s net worth
at $1.1 billion, largely from the YES network. The New York
Yankees, which he acquired in 1973 for $10 million, are now
worth $1.6 billion but are 95% leveraged due to debt from
the new Yankee Stadium, according to Forbes.
Because Steinbrenner died in a year when there is no fed-
eral estate tax, he potentially saved his heirs a 55% estate tax
on his assets—or a tax bill of about $600 million. The 55% tax
takes effect on January 1, 2011. If Steinbrenner had died in
2009 when the estate tax rate was 45%, his estate tax bill
might have been nearer $500 million. Because the wealthy
often do elaborate planning, putting assets into trusts taxed
separately from the estate or into foundations that are tax-
exempt, it is unclear how large his estate will be. Estate taxes
may also be postponed on assets left to a spouse in years
when there is an estate tax.
There is no estate tax this 
year due to changes made by
Congress in 2001. Those
changes eased the estate tax
over several years and culmi-
nated with its repeal this year,
followed by a return to high tax
levels in 2011. Experts say few
ever expected the tax’s repeal,
and its 2011 reinstatement,
would actually take effect.
Instead they believed lawmak-
ers would smooth out the tax
rates at some point between
2002 and the end of 2009.
Congress never got around
to it, and the tax lapsed this year. Many still hope lawmakers
will fix this year’s law, which actually raises taxes on heirs of
the merely affluent (with assets between $1.3 and $4 million).
But they still haven’t acted and have little time to do so.
Because of the huge chasm separating 2010’s zero tax
rate from 2011’s 55% rate, some fear that Congress has pro-
vided the wealthy with an incentive for dying—or their rela-
tives with an incentive for making sure they die—before the
clock strikes midnight on Dec. 31.

CHAPTER 19
Public Finance: The Economics of Taxation 397
The simultaneous reactions of many households and/or firms to the presence of a tax may cause
relative prices to change, and price changes affect households’ well-being. Households may feel the
impact of a tax on the sources side or on the uses side of the income equation. (We use the term
income equation because the amount of income from all sources must be equal to the amount of
income allocated to all uses—including saving—in a given period.) On the sources side,a household
is hurt when the net wages or profits that it receives fall; on the uses side, a household is hurt when
the prices of the goods and services that it buys rise. If your wages remain the same but the price of
every item that you buy doubles, you are in the same position you would have been in if your wages
had been cut by 50 percent and prices hadn’t changed.In short,the imposition of a tax or a change in
a tax can change behavior. Changes in behavior can affect supply and demand in markets and cause
prices to change. When prices change in input or output markets, some households are made better
off and some are made worse off. These final changes determine the ultimate burden of the tax.
Tax shifting takes place when households can alter their behavior and do something to avoid
paying a tax. Such shifting is easily accomplished when only certain items are singled out for taxation.
Suppose a heavy tax were levied on bananas. Initially, the tax would make the price of bananas much
higher, but there are many potential substitutes for bananas. Consumers can avoid the tax by not buy-
ing bananas,and that is what many will do.But as demand drops,the market price of bananas falls and
banana growers lose money. The tax shifts from consumers to the growers, at least in the short run.
A tax such as the retail sales tax, which is levied at the same rate on all consumer goods, is
harder to avoid. The only thing consumers can do to avoid such a tax is to consume less of every-
thing. If consumers consume less, saving will increase, but otherwise there are few opportunities
for tax avoidance and therefore for tax shifting. Broad-based taxes are less likely to be shifted and
more likely to “stick” where they are levied than “partial taxes” are.
The Incidence of Payroll Taxes
In 2009, about 42.7 percent of federal revenues came from social insurance taxes, also called payroll
taxes. The revenues from payroll taxes go to support Social Security, unemployment compensation,
and other health and disability benefits for workers. Some of these taxes are levied on employers as
a percentage of payroll, and some are levied on workers as a percentage of wages or salaries earned.
To analyze the payroll tax, let us take a tax levied on employers and sketch the reactions that
are likely to follow. When the tax is first levied, firms find that the price of labor increases. Firms
may react in two ways. First, they may substitute capital for the now more-expensive labor.
Second, higher costs and lower profits may lead to a cut in production. Both reactions mean a
lower demand for labor. Lower demand for labor reduces wages, and part of the tax is thus passed
on (or shifted to) the workers, who end up earning less. The extent to which the tax is shifted to
workers depends on how workers can react to the lower wages.
We can develop a more formal analysis of this situation with a picture of the market before the tax
is levied. Figure 19.2 shows equilibrium in a hypothetical labor market with no payroll tax. Before we
proceed, we should review the factors that determine the shapes of the supply and demand curves.
sources side/uses side
The
impact of a tax may be felt on
one or the other or on both
sides of the income equation.
A tax may cause net income to
fall (damage on the sources
side), or it may cause prices of
goods and services to rise so
that income buys less (damage
on the uses side).

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
Labor Supply and Labor Demand Curves in Perfect Competition: A
Review
Recall that the demand for labor in perfectly competitive markets depends on its pro-
ductivity. As you saw in Chapter 10, a perfectly competitive, profit-maximizing firm will hire
labor up to the point at which the market wage is equal to labor’s marginal revenue product. The
shape of the demand curve for labor shows how responsive firms are to changes in wages.
Recall from Chapter 6 that household behavior and thus the shape of the labor supply curve
depend on the relative strengths of income and substitution effects. The labor supply curve repre-
sents the reaction of workers to changes in the wage rate. Household behavior depends on the
after-tax wage that workers actually take home per hour of work. In contrast, labor demand is a
function of the full amount that firms must pay per unit of labor, an amount that may include a tax
if it is levied directly on payroll, as it is in our example. Such a tax, when present, drives a “wedge”
between the price of labor that firms face and take-home wages.
Imposing a Payroll Tax: Who Pays?
In Figure 19.2, there were no taxes and the wage
that firms paid was the same as the wage that workers took home.At a wage of W0, quantity of labor
supplied and quantity of labor demanded were equal and the labor market was in equilibrium.2
But suppose employers must pay a tax of $T per unit of labor.Figure 19.3 shows a new curve that
is parallel to the supply curve but above it by a distance T. The new curve, S1, shows labor supply as a
function of what firms pay. Note that S1 is not really a new supply curve. Supply is still determined by
what workers take home. S1 simply adds T to the supply curve. Regardless of how the ultimate burden
of the tax is shared, there is a difference between what firms pay and what workers take home.
If the initial wage is W0 per hour, firms will face a price of W0 + T per unit of labor immedi-
ately after the tax is levied. Workers still receive only W0, however. The higher wage rate—that is,
the higher price of labor that firms now face—reduces the quantity of labor demanded from L0
to Ld, and the firms lay off workers. Workers initially still receive W0, so that amount of labor
supplied does not change, and the result is an excess supply of labor equal to (L0 - Ld).
The excess supply applies downward pressure to the market wage, and wages fall, shifting
some of the tax burden onto workers. The issue is how far wages will fall. Figure 19.3 shows that
a new equilibrium is achieved at W1, with firms paying W1 + T. When workers take home W1,
they supply L1 units of labor. If firms must pay W1 + T, they will demand L1 units of labor, and
the market clears. Quantity supplied again equals quantity demanded.
In this case, then, employers and employees share the burden of the payroll tax. Initially, firms
paid W0; after the tax, they pay W1 + T. Initially, workers received W0; after the tax, they end up with

the United States.

the lower wage W1. Total tax collections by the government are equal to T  L1. Geometrically, tax
collections are equal to the entire shaded area in Figure 19.3. The workers’ share of the tax burden is
the lower portion, (W0 - W1)  L1. The firms’ share is the upper portion, [(W1 + T) - W0]  L1.
The relative sizes of the firms’share and the workers’share of the total tax burden depend on the
shapes of the demand and supply curves. Figure 19.4, parts a and b, show that the ultimate burden of
a payroll tax depends, at least in part, on the elasticity of labor supply. If labor supply is very elastic
(that is to say, responsive to price), take-home wages do not fall very much and workers bear only a
small portion of the tax. But if labor supply is inelastic, or unresponsive to price, most of the burden
is borne by workers. Workers bear the bulk of the burden of a payroll tax if labor supply is relatively
inelastic, and firms bear the bulk of the burden of a payroll tax if labor supply is relatively elastic.
Empirical studies of labor supply behavior in the United States suggest that for most of the work-
force, the elasticity of labor supply is close to zero. Therefore; most of the payroll tax in the United
States is probably borne by workers.The result would be exactly the same if the tax were initially levied
on workers rather than on firms. Go back to the equilibrium in Figure 19.3 on p. 398, with wages at
W0. But now assume that the tax of $T per hour is levied on workers rather than firms. The burden
will end up being shared by firms and workers in the exact same proportions.Initially,take-home wages

up.That shifts part of the burden back to employers.The “story”is different,but the result is the same.
Table 19.3 presents an estimate of the incidence of payroll taxes (Social Security taxes) in the
United States in 2007. This estimate assumes that both the employers’ share and employees’ share
of the payroll taxes are ultimately borne by employees.
The payroll tax is regressive at the top income levels for two reasons.First,in 2010,most of the tax
(6.2 percent of total wage and salary income levied on both employers and employees) did not apply
to wages and salaries above $106,800. The remainder of the total 7.65 percent tax—1.45 percent—

Payroll Tax with Elastic
(a) and Inelastic

The ultimate burden of a payroll
tax depends on the elasticities of
labor supply and labor demand.
For example, if supply is relatively
elastic, as in part a, the burden
falls largely on employers; if the
supply is relatively inelastic, as in
part b, the burden falls largely 
on workers.

applied to all wage and salary income.Second,wages and salaries fell as a percentage of total income as
we move up the income scale. Those with higher incomes earn a larger portion of their incomes from
profits, dividends, rents, and so on, and these kinds of income are not subject to the payroll tax.
Some economists dispute the conclusion that the payroll tax is borne entirely by wage earn-
ers. Even if labor supply is inelastic, some wages are set in the process of collective bargaining
between unions and large firms. If the payroll tax results in a higher gross wage in the bargaining
process, firms may find themselves faced with higher costs. Higher costs either reduce profits to
owners or are passed on to consumers in the form of higher product prices.
The Incidence of Corporate Profits Taxes
Another tax that requires careful analysis is the corporate profits tax that is levied by the federal
government as well as by most states. The corporate profits tax or corporation income tax, is a tax on
the profits of firms that are organized as corporations. Corporations are firms granted limited lia-
bility status by the government. Limited liability means that shareholders/owners can lose only
what they have invested. The owners of partnerships and proprietorships do not enjoy limited liabil-
ity and do not pay this tax; rather, they report their firms’ income directly on their individual
income tax returns.
We can think of the corporate tax as a tax on capital income, or profits, in one sector of the
economy. For simplicity, we assume that there are only two sectors of the economy, corporate and
noncorporate, and only two factors of production, labor and capital. Owners of capital receive
profits, and workers (labor) are paid a wage.
Like the payroll tax, the corporate tax may affect households on the sources or the uses side
of the income equation. The tax may affect profits earned by owners of capital, wages earned by
workers, or prices of corporate and noncorporate products. Once again, the key question is how
large these changes are likely to be.
When first imposed, the corporate profits tax initially reduces net (after-tax) profits in the
corporate sector. Assuming the economy was in long-run equilibrium before the tax was levied,
firms in both the corporate and noncorporate sectors were earning a normal rate of return; there
was no reason to expect higher profits in one sector than in the other. Suddenly, firms in the cor-
porate sector become significantly less profitable as a result of the tax. (In 2009, for example, the
tax rate applicable to most corporations was 35 percent.)
In response to these lower profits,capital investment begins to favor the nontaxed sector because
after-tax profits are higher there. Firms in the taxed sector contract in size or (in some cases) go out
of business, while firms in the nontaxed sector expand and new firms enter its various industries. As
this happens, the flow of capital from the taxed to the nontaxed sector reduces the profit rate in the
nontaxed sector: More competition springs up, and product prices are driven down. Some of the tax
burden shifts to capital income earners in the noncorporate sector,who end up earning lower profits.
As capital flows out of the corporate sector in response to lower after-tax profits, the
profit rate in that sector rises somewhat because fewer firms means less supply, which means
higher prices, and so on. Presumably, capital will continue to favor the nontaxed sector until
the after-tax profit rates in the two sectors are equal. Even though the tax is imposed on just
one sector, it eventually depresses after-tax profits in all sectors equally.

CHAPTER 19
Public Finance: The Economics of Taxation 401
Under these circumstances, the products of corporations will probably become more expen-
sive and products of proprietorships and partnerships will probably become less expensive. But
because almost everyone buys both corporate and noncorporate products, these excise effects
(that is, effects on the prices of products) are likely to have a minimal impact on the distribution
of the tax burden. In essence, the price increases in the corporate sector and the price decreases in
the noncorporate sector cancel each other out.
Finally, what effect does the imposition of a corporate income tax have on labor? Wages
could actually rise or fall, but the effect is not likely to be large. Taxed firms will have an incentive
to substitute labor for capital because capital income is now taxed. This could benefit labor by
driving up wages. In addition, the contracting sector will use less labor and capital, but if the
taxed sector is the capital-intensive corporate sector, the bulk of the effect will be felt by capital.
The price of capital will fall more than the price of labor.
The Burden of the Corporate Tax
The ultimate burden of the corporate tax appears to
depend on several factors: the relative capital/labor intensity of the two sectors, the ease with
which capital and labor can be substituted in the two sectors, and elasticities of demand for the
products of each sector. In 1962, economist Arnold Harberger, then of the University of Chicago,
analyzed this and concluded that owners of corporations, proprietorships, and partnerships all
bear the burden of the corporate tax in rough proportion to profits, even though it is directly
levied only on corporations. Harberger also found that wage effects of the corporate tax were
small and that excise effects, as we just noted, probably cancel each other out.3
Much has been written about the incidence of the corporate tax since Harberger, but the
general conclusion that capital owners bear most of the tax burden is still viewed as correct by
most economists.
One exception to this conclusion is corporate taxation of a monopolist. You might be
tempted to conclude that because monopolists can control market price, they will simply pass on
the profits tax in the form of higher prices to consumers of monopoly products. But theory pre-
dicts just the opposite: that the tax burden will remain with the monopolist.
Remember that monopolists are constrained by market demand. That is, they choose the
combination of price and output that is consistent with market demand and that maximizes
profit. If a proportion of that profit is taxed, the choice of price and quantity will not change.
Why not? Quite simply, if you behave so as to maximize profit and then I come and take half of
your profit, you maximize your half by maximizing the whole, which is exactly what you would
do in the absence of the tax. Thus, your price and output do not change, the tax is shifted, and
you end up paying the tax. In the long run, capital will not leave the taxed monopoly sector, as it
did in the competitive case. Even with the tax, the monopolist is earning higher profits than are
possible elsewhere.
Table 19.4 presents an estimate of the actual incidence of the U.S. corporate income tax in
2007. The burden of the corporate income tax is clearly progressive because profits and capital
income make up a much bigger part of the incomes of high-income households.

PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
The Overall Incidence of Taxes in the United States:
Empirical Evidence
Many researchers have done complete analyses under varying assumptions about tax incidence,and in
most cases their results are similar. State and local taxes (with sales taxes playing a big role) seem as a
group to be mildly regressive. Federal taxes, dominated by the individual income tax but increasingly
affected by the regressive payroll tax, are mildly progressive. The overall system is mildly progressive.
Excess Burdens and the Principle of Neutrality
You have seen that when households and firms make decisions in the presence of a tax that differ
from decisions they would make in its absence, the burden of the tax can be shifted from those for
whom it was originally intended. Now we can take the same logic one step further. When taxes
distort economic conditions, they impose burdens on society that, in aggregate, exceed the rev-
enue collected by the government.
The amount by which the burden of a tax exceeds the total revenue collected by the govern-
ment is called the excess burden of the tax. The total burden of a tax is the sum of the revenue
collected from the tax and the excess burden created by the tax. Because excess burdens are a form
of waste, or lost value, tax policy should be written to minimize them. (Excess burdens are also
called deadweight losses.)
The size of the excess burden imposed by a tax depends on the extent to which economic
decisions are distorted. The general principle that emerges from the analysis of excess burdens is
the principle of neutrality. Ceteris paribus, or all else equal,4 a tax that is neutral with respect to
economic decisions is preferred to one that distorts economic decisions.
In practice, all taxes change behavior and distort economic choices. A product-specific
excise tax raises the price of the taxed item, and people can avoid the tax by buying substitutes.
An income tax distorts the choice between present and future consumption and between work
and leisure. The corporate tax influences investment and production decisions—investment is
diverted away from the corporate sector, and firms may be induced to substitute labor for capital.
How Do Excess Burdens Arise?
The idea that a tax can impose an extra cost, or excess burden, by distorting choices can be illustrated
by example. Consider a perfectly competitive industry that produces an output, X, using the technol-
ogy shown in Figure 19.5. Using technology A, firms can produce 1 unit of output with 7 units of
capital (K) and 3 units of labor (L). Using technology B, the production of 1 unit of output requires
4 units of capital and 7 units of labor. A is thus the more capital-intensive technology.
If we assume labor and capital each cost $2 per unit, it costs $20 to produce each unit of out-
put with technology A and $22 to produce each unit of output with technology B. Firms will
choose technology A. Because we assume perfect competition, output price will be driven to cost
of production and the price of output will in the long run be driven to $20 per unit.
Now let us narrow our focus to the distortion of technology choice that is brought about by
the imposition of a tax. Assume that demand for the good in question is perfectly inelastic at
4 The phrase ceteris paribus (all else equal) is important. In judging the merits of a tax or a change in tax policy, the degree of
neutrality is only one criterion among many, and it often comes into conflict with others. For example, tax A may impose a
larger excess burden than tax B, but society may deem A more equitable.

1,000 units of output. That is, regardless of price, households will buy 1,000 units of the good. A
price of $20 per unit means consumers pay a total of $20,000 for 1,000 units of X.
Now suppose the government levies a tax of 50 percent on capital. This has the effect of rais-
ing the price of capital, PK, to $3. Figure 19.6 shows what would happen to unit cost of produc-
tion after the tax is imposed. With capital now more expensive, the firm switches to the more
labor-intensive technology B. With the tax in place, X can be produced at a cost of $27 per unit
using technology A but for $26 per unit using technology B.
If demand is perfectly inelastic, buyers continue to buy 1,000 units of X regardless of its
price. (We shall ignore any distortions of consumer choices that might result from the imposition
of the tax.) Recall that the tax is 50 percent, or $1 per unit of capital used. Because it takes 4 units
of capital to produce each unit of output, firms—which are now using technology B—will pay a
total tax to the government of $4 per unit of output produced. With 1,000 units of output pro-
duced and sold, total tax collections amount to $4,000.
But if you look carefully, you will see that the burden of the tax exceeds $4,000. After the tax,
consumers will be paying $26 per unit for the good. Twenty-six dollars is now the unit cost of
producing the good using the best available technology in the presence of the capital tax.
Consumers will pay $26,000 for 1,000 units of the good. This represents an increase of
$6,000 over the previous total of $20,000. The revenue raised from the tax is $4,000, but its total
burden is $6,000. There is an excess burden of $2,000.
How did this excess burden arise? Look back at Figure 19.5. You can see that technology B is
less efficient than technology A. (Unit costs of production are $2 higher per unit using technol-
ogy B.) But the tax on capital has caused firms to switch to this less efficient, labor-intensive
mode of production. The result is a waste of $2 per unit of output. The total burden of the tax is
equal to the revenue collected plus the loss due to the wasteful choice of technology, and the
excess burden is $2 per unit times 1,000 units, or $2,000.
The same principle holds for taxes that distort consumption decisions. Suppose that you
prefer to consume bundle X to bundle Y when there is no tax, but choose bundle Y when there is
a tax in place. Not only do you pay the tax, you also end up with a bundle of goods that is worth
less than the bundle you would have chosen had the tax not been levied. Again, we have the burden
of an extra cost. The larger the distortion that a tax causes in behavior, the larger the excess bur-
den of the tax. Taxes levied on broad bases tend to distort choices less and impose smaller excess
burdens than taxes on more sharply defined bases. This follows from our discussion earlier in this
chapter: The more partial the tax, the easier it is to avoid. An important part of the logic behind
the recommendation of the president’s tax reform commission in 2005 was that broader bases and
lower rates reduce the distorting effects of the tax system and minimize excess burdens.
The only tax that has no excess burden is the lump-sum tax, where the tax you pay does not
depend on your behavior or your income or your wealth. Everyone pays the same amount; there is no
way to avoid the tax. In 1990, the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain
replaced the local property tax with a tax that was very similar to a lump-sum tax. Such a tax is highly
regressive,and the perceived unfairness of it led her successor,John Major,to call for its repeal in 1991.
Measuring Excess Burdens
It is possible to measure the size of excess burdens if we know something about how people
respond to price changes. Look at the demand curve in Figure 19.7. The product originally sold
for a price, P0, equal to marginal cost (which, for simplicity, we assume is constant). Recall that
when input prices are determined in competitive markets, marginal cost reflects the real value of
the resources used in producing the product.

404
PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
To measure the total burden of the tax, we need to recall the notion of consumer surplus
from Chapter 4. At any price, some people pay less for a product than it is worth to them. All we
reveal when we buy a product is that it is worth at least the price being charged. For example, if
only 1 unit of product X were auctioned, someone would pay a price close to D in Figure 19.7. By
paying only P0, that person received a “surplus” equal to (D – P0). (For a review of consumer sur-
plus and how it is measured, see Chapters 4 and 6.)
Consider what happens when an excise tax raises the price of X from P0 to P1 = P0 + T,
where T is the tax per unit of X. First, the government collects revenue. The amount of revenue
collected is equal to T times the number of units of X purchased (X1). You can see that T  X1
is equal to the area of rectangle P1ABP0. Second, because consumers must now pay a price of P1,
the consumer surplus generated in the market is reduced from the area of triangle DCP0 to the
area of the smaller triangle DAP1. The excess burden is equal to the original (pretax) consumer
surplus minus the after-tax surplus minus the total taxes collected by the government.
In other words, the original value of consumer surplus (triangle DCP0) has been broken
up into three parts: the area of triangle DAP1 that is still consumer surplus, the area of rec-
tangle P1ABP0 that is tax revenue collected by the government, and the area of triangle ACB
that is lost. Thus, the area ACB is an approximate measure of the excess burden of the tax.
The total burden of the tax is the sum of the revenue collected and the excess burden: the
area of P1ACP0.
Excess Burdens and the Degree of Distortion
The size of the excess burden that results from a decision-distorting tax depends on the degree to
which decisions change in response to that tax. In the case of an excise tax, consumer behavior is
reflected in elasticity of demand. The more elastic the demand curve, the greater the distortion
caused by any given tax rate.
Figure 19.8 shows how the size of the consumer response determines the size of the
excess burden. At price P0, the quantity demanded by consumers is X0. Now suppose that the
government imposes a tax of $T per unit of X. The two demand curves (D1 and D2) illustrate
two possible responses by consumers. The change in quantity demanded along D1 (from X0
to X1) is greater than the change in quantity demanded along D2 (from X0 to X2). In other
words, the response of consumers illustrated by D1 is more elastic than the response of con-
sumers along D2.
The excess burdens that would result from the tax under the two assumptions about demand
elasticity are approximately equal to the areas of the shaded triangles in Figure 19.8. As you can
see, where demand is more responsive (more elastic), the excess burden is larger.
If demand were perfectly inelastic, no distortion would occur and there would be no excess
burden. The tax would simply transfer part of the surplus being earned by consumers to the
government. That is why some economists favor uniform land taxes over other taxes. Because

land is in perfectly inelastic supply, a uniform tax on all land uses distorts economic decisions
less than taxes levied on other factors of production that are in variable supply.
The Principle of Second Best
Now that we have established the connection between taxes that distort decisions and excess bur-
dens, we can add more complexity to our earlier discussions. Although it may seem that distort-
ing taxes always creates excess burdens, this is not necessarily the case. A distorting tax is
sometimes desirable when other distortions already exist in the economy. This is called the
principle of second best. At least two kinds of circumstances favor nonneutral (that is, distort-
ing) taxes: the presence of externalities and the presence of other distorting taxes.
We already examined externalities at some length in Chapter 16. If some activity by a firm
or household imposes costs on society that are not considered by decision makers, firms and
households are likely to make economically inefficient choices. Pollution is the classic example
of an externality, but there are thousands of others. An efficient allocation of resources can be
restored if a tax is imposed on the externality-generating activity that is equal to the value of the
damages caused by it. Such a tax forces the decision maker to consider the full economic cost of
the decision.
Because taxing for externalities changes decisions that would otherwise be made, it does in a
sense “distort” economic decisions. But its purpose is to force decision makers to consider real
costs that they would otherwise ignore. In the case of pollution, for example, the distortion
caused by a tax is desirable. Instead of causing an excess burden, it results in an efficiency gain.
(Review Chapter 16 if this is not clear.)
A distorting tax can also improve economic welfare when other taxes are present that
already distort decisions. Suppose there were only three goods, X, Y, and Z, and a 5 percent excise
tax on Y and Z. The taxes on Y and Z distort consumer decisions away from those goods and
toward X. Imposing a similar tax on X reduces the distortion of the existing system of taxes.
When consumers face equal taxes on all goods, they cannot avoid the tax by changing what they
buy. The distortion caused by imposing a tax on X corrects for a preexisting distortion—the taxes
on Y and Z.
Let’s return to the example described earlier in Figure 19.5 on p. 402 and Figure 19.6 on p. 403.
Imposing the tax of 50 percent on the use of capital generated revenues of $4,000 but imposed a
burden of $6,000 on consumers.A distortion now exists. But what would happen if the government
imposed an additional tax of 50 percent, or $1 per unit, on labor? Such a tax would push our firm

406
PART III
Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
back toward the more efficient technology A. In fact, the labor tax would generate a total revenue of
$6,000, but the burden it imposes on consumers would be only $4,000. (It is a good idea for you to
work these figures out yourself.)
Optimal Taxation
The idea that taxes work together to affect behavior has led tax theorists to search for optimal tax-
ation systems. Knowing how people will respond to taxes would allow us to design a system that
would minimize the overall excess burden. For example, if we know the elasticity of demand for
all traded goods, we can devise an optimal system of excise taxes that are heaviest on those goods
with relatively inelastic demand and lightest on those goods with relatively elastic demands.
Of course, it is impossible to collect all the information required to implement the optimal
tax systems that have been suggested. This point brings us full circle, and we end up where we
started, with the principle of neutrality: All else equal, taxes that are neutral with respect to eco-
nomic decisions are generally preferable to taxes that distort economic decisions. Taxes that are
not neutral impose excess burdens.
THE ECONOMICS OF TAXATION p. 389
1. Public finance is one of the major subfields of applied eco-
nomics. A major interest within this subfield is the econom-
ics of taxation.
2. Taxes are ultimately paid by people. Taxes may be imposed
on transactions, institutions, property, and all kinds of other
things, but in the final analysis, taxes are paid by individuals
or households.
3. The base of a tax is the measure or value upon which the tax
is levied. The rate structure of a tax determines the portion of
the base that must be paid in tax.
4. A tax whose burden is a constant proportion of income for
all households is a proportional tax. A tax that exacts a higher
proportion of income from higher-income households is a
progressive tax. A tax that enacts a lower proportion of
income from higher-income households is a regressive tax. In
the United States, income taxes are progressive and sales and
excise taxes are regressive.
5. Your average tax rate is the total amount of tax you pay
divided by your total income. Your marginal tax rate is
the tax rate that you pay on any additional income that
you have earned. Marginal tax rates have the most influ-
ence on behavior.
6. There is much disagreement over what constitutes a fair tax
system. One theory contends that people should bear tax
burdens in proportion to the benefits that they receive from
government expenditures. This is the benefits-received
principle. Another theory contends that people should bear
tax burdens in line with their ability to pay. This ability-to-pay
principle has dominated U.S. tax policy.
7. The three leading candidates for best tax base are income,
consumption, and wealth.
TAX INCIDENCE: WHO PAYS? p. 396 
8. As a result of behavioral changes and market adjustments,
tax burdens are often not borne by those initially responsible
for paying them. When we speak of the incidence of a tax, we
are referring to the ultimate distribution of its burden.
9. Taxes change behavior, and changes in behavior can affect
supply and demand in markets, causing prices to change.
When prices change in input markets or in output mar-
kets, some people may be made better off and some worse
off. These final changes determine the ultimate burden of
a tax.
10. Tax shifting occurs when households can alter their behavior
and do something to avoid paying a tax. In general, broad-
based taxes are less likely to be shifted and more likely to
stick where they are levied than partial taxes are.
11. When labor supply is more elastic, firms bear the bulk 
of a tax imposed on labor. When labor supply is more
inelastic, workers bear the bulk of the tax burden. Because
the elasticity of labor supply in the United States is close
to zero, most economists conclude that most of the
payroll tax in the United States is probably borne 
by workers.
12. The payroll tax is regressive at top incomes for two reasons.
First, in 2009, most of the tax (6.2 percent of total income
levied on both employers and employees) did not apply to
wages and salaries above $106,800. The remainder of the total
7.65 percent—only 1.45 percent—applied to all wage and
salary income. Second, wages and salaries fall as a percentage
of total income as we move up the income scale. Those with
higher incomes earn a larger portion of their incomes from
profits, dividends, rents, and so on, and these kinds of income
are not subject to the payroll tax.
13. The ultimate burden of the corporate tax appears to depend
on several factors. One generally accepted study shows that
the owners of corporations, proprietorships, and partner-
ships all bear the burden of the corporate tax in rough pro-
portion to profits, even though it is directly levied only on
corporations, that wage effects are small, and that excise
effects are roughly neutral. However, there is still much
debate about whom the corporate tax “hurts.” The burden of
the corporate tax is progressive because profits and capital
income make up a much bigger part of the incomes of the
high-income households.

14. Under a reasonable set of assumptions about tax shifting,
state and local taxes seem as a group to be mildly regressive.
Federal taxes, dominated by the individual income tax but
increasingly affected by the regressive payroll tax, are mildly
progressive. The overall system is mildly progressive.
EXCESS BURDENS AND THE PRINCIPLE OF
NEUTRALITY p. 402 
15. When taxes distort economic decisions, they impose burdens
that, in aggregate, exceed the revenue collected by the gov-
ernment. The amount by which the burden of a tax exceeds
the revenue collected by the government is called the excess
burden. The size of excess burdens depends on the degree to
which economic decisions are changed by the tax. The
principle of neutrality holds that the most efficient taxes are
broad-based taxes that do not distort economic decisions.
16. The excess burden imposed by a tax is equal to the pre-tax
consumer surplus minus the after-tax consumer surplus
minus the total taxes collected by the government. The more
elastic the demand curve, the greater the distortion caused
by any given tax rate.
THE PRINCIPLE OF SECOND BEST p. 405 
17. The principle of second best holds that a tax that distorts eco-
nomic decisions does not necessarily impose an excess bur-
den. If previously existing distortions or externalities exist,
such a tax may actually improve efficiency.

out?  Did the federal system become more regressive or progressive
after the dust settled in 2011?  How serious was the gridlock?
4. A citizens’ group in the Pacific Northwest has the following
statement in its charter:
“Our goal is to ensure that large, powerful corporations pay
their fair share of taxes in this country.”
To implement this goal, the group has recommended and
lobbied for an increase in the corporation income tax and a
reduction in the individual income tax. Would you support such
a petition? Explain your logic.
5. Taxes on necessities that have low demand elasticities impose
large excess burdens because consumers can’t avoid buying
them. Do you agree or disagree with that statement? Explain.
6. For each of the following statements, do you agree or dis-
agree? Why?
a. Economic theory predicts unequivocally that a payroll tax
reduction will increase the supply of labor.
b. Corporation income taxes levied on a monopolist are likely
to be regressive because the monopoly can pass on its bur-
den to consumers.
c. All nonneutral taxes are undesirable.
7. In calculating total faculty compensation, the administration of
Doughnut University includes payroll taxes (Social Security taxes)
paid as a benefit to faculty. After all, those tax payments are earning
future entitlements for the faculty under Social Security. However,
the American Association of University Professors has argued that,
far from being a benefit, the employer’s contribution is simply a
tax and that its burden falls on the faculty even though it is paid by
the university. Discuss both sides of this debate.
1. Suppose that in 2011, Congress passed and the president signed
a new simple income tax with a flat rate of 25 percent on all
income over $25,000 (no tax on the first $25,000). Assume that
the tax is imposed on every individual separately. For each of
the following total income levels, calculate taxes due and com-
pute the average tax rate. Plot the average tax rate on a graph
with income along the horizontal axis. Is the tax proportional,
progressive, or regressive? Explain why.
a. $25,000
b. $35,000
c. $45,000
d. $60,000
e. $80,000
f. $100,000
2. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 392] Using the tax
brackets and rates for 2009 on p. 392, compute the total tax for
each of the following income levels for a single taxpayer. In each
case, calculate average and marginal tax rates. Assume that in
each case the taxpayer chooses the standard deduction and
qualifies for a single exemption.
a. Gross income = $30,000
b. Gross income = $50,000
c. Gross income = $100,000
d. Gross income = $190,000
3. During the debate over tax policy following the land slide victory
of the Republicans in the midterm elections in 2010, most thought
the Federal Government was headed for gridlock. Both the
Republicans and members of the new “Tea Party”favored tax pro-
visions primarily beneficial to high income tax payers, while the
Democrats tended to favored middle class tax cuts and increases

Market Imperfections and the Role of Government 
8. Developing countries rarely have a sophisticated income tax struc-
ture like that in the United States. The primary means of raising
revenues in many developing countries is through commodity
taxes. What problems do you see with taxing particular goods in
these countries? (Hint: Think about elasticities of demand.)
9. Suppose a special tax was introduced that used the value of one’s
automobile as the tax base. Each person would pay taxes equal to
10 percent of the value of his or her car. Would the tax be pro-
portional, regressive, or progressive? What assumptions do you
make in answering this question? What distortions do you think
would appear in the economy if such a tax were introduced?
10. You are given the following information on a proposed “restau-
rant meals tax” in the Republic of Olympus. Olympus collects
no other specific excise taxes, and all other government rev-
enues come from a neutral lump-sum tax. (A lump-sum tax is a
tax of a fixed sum paid by all people regardless of their circum-
stances.) Assume further that the burden of the tax is fully
borne by consumers.
Now consider the following data:
 Meals consumed before the tax: 12 million
 Meals consumed after the tax: 10 million
 Average price per meal: $15 (not including the tax)
 Tax rate: 10 percent
Estimate the size of the excess burden of the tax. What is the
excess burden as a percentage of revenues collected from the tax?
11. [Related to Economics in Practice on p. 396] As of 2010,
Congress had not reversed the tax change of 2001 which phased
out the gift and estate tax. Do you think the gift and estate tax
should be reinstated? Why or why not? Using the key words
“Federal Gift and Estate Tax”, search the Internet to find the cur-
rent status of this tax. Has the tax change now been reversed; if
so, what are the new rates? What amount of assets can be passed
on to one’s children tax-free this year?
12. The graph below represents equilibrium in a competitive labor
market both before and after a payroll tax which is levied on the
employer has been implemented. Before the payroll tax, the equi-
librium quantity of labor was 55 units. Supply curve S1 represents
supply as a function of what firms pay, including the tax. S0 repre-
sents labor supply as a function of what workers take home.
a. What is the amount of the per-unit payroll tax?
b. What is the per-unit price of labor faced by firms immedi-
ately after the tax is levied?
c. What wage will workers receive immediately after the tax
is levied?
d. What are the quantity of labor demanded and the quantity
of labor supplied immediately after the tax is levied?
e. If, after the tax is levied, the equilibrium quantity of labor
settles at 40 units, what will be the new equilibrium wage?
f. If, after the tax is levied, the equilibrium quantity of labor
settles at 40 units, what are the amounts of the workers’
share of the tax burden, the firms’ share of the tax burden,
and the total tax collection?
13. Assume that at a price of $5 per pound, the quantity of coffee
demanded is 20 pounds. Now assume that the government
imposes an excise tax on coffee of $2 per pound. Draw a graph
showing demand when consumers are relatively responsive to
the tax and quantity demanded falls by 50 percent, and when
consumers are relatively nonresponsive to the tax and quantity
demanded falls by 10 percent. Calculate the amount of the excess
burden of this tax for each situation and show this on the graph.
14. The market demand for product X is given by Qd = 8 – 1/3P
and the market supply for good X is given by Qs = P – 8, where
P = price per unit.
a. Draw a supply and demand graph with these curves. What
are the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity? 
b. A per-unit excise tax is imposed on product X, and the mar-
ket supply with the tax is now given by Qs = P –12. Add this
supply curve to your graph and identify the new equilibrium
price and equilibrium quantity. What is the value of the per-
unit tax? How much of this per-unit tax will be paid by con-
sumers and how much will be paid by the producer? What is
the value of the excess burden of this tax? What is the value
of the tax revenue?
15. In the United States, 41 states have passed legislation to legalize
lotteries and the states use the lottery proceeds to raise revenue.
If you view the price of a lottery ticket as a tax, do you think it
would be a proportional, progressive, or regressive tax? What
information would you need to definitively determine if it was
proportional, progressive, or regressive?
16. Each year around April 15, discussions heat up regarding the tax
system in the United States. A number of people are in favor of
replacing the current federal income tax with either a flat tax or
a consumption tax. Explain whether the current federal income
tax is proportional, progressive, or regressive. Do the same for a
flat tax and a consumption tax.

Macroeconomics is part of our
everyday lives. If the macroecon-
omy is doing well, jobs are easy to
find, incomes are generally rising,
and profits of corporations are
high. On the other hand, if the
macroeconomy is in a slump, new
jobs are scarce, incomes are not
growing well, and profits are low.
Students who entered the job mar-
ket in the boom of the late 1990s in
the United States, on average, had
an easier time finding a job than
did those who entered in the reces-
sion of 2008–2009. Given the large effect that the macroeconomy can have on our lives, it is
important that we understand how it works.
We begin by discussing the differences between microeconomics and macroeconomics
that we glimpsed in Chapter 1. Microeconomics examines the functioning of individual
industries and the behavior of individual decision-making units, typically firms and house-
holds. With a few assumptions about how these units behave (firms maximize profits; house-
holds maximize utility), we can derive useful conclusions about how markets work and how
resources are allocated.
Instead of focusing on the factors that influence the production of particular products and
the behavior of individual industries, macroeconomics focuses on the determinants of total
national output. Macroeconomics studies not household income but national income, not indi-
vidual prices but the overall price level. It does not analyze the demand for labor in the automo-
bile industry but instead total employment in the economy.
Both microeconomics and macroeconomics are concerned with the decisions of households
and firms. Microeconomics deals with individual decisions; macroeconomics deals with the sum
of these individual decisions. Aggregate is used in macroeconomics to refer to sums. When we
speak of aggregate behavior, we mean the behavior of all households and firms together. We
also speak of aggregate consumption and aggregate investment, which refer to total consumption
and total investment in the economy, respectively.
Because microeconomists and macroeconomists look at the economy from different perspec-
tives, you might expect that they would reach somewhat different conclusions about the way the
economy behaves. This is true to some extent. Microeconomists generally conclude that markets
work well. They see prices as flexible, adjusting to maintain equality between quantity supplied and
quantity demanded. Macroeconomists, however, observe that important prices in the economy—
for example, the wage rate (or price of labor)—often seem “sticky.” Sticky prices are prices that do
not always adjust rapidly to maintain equality between quantity supplied and quantity demanded.
Microeconomists do not expect to see the quantity of apples supplied exceeding the quantity of

apples demanded because the price of apples is not sticky. On the other hand, macroeconomists—
who analyze aggregate behavior—examine periods of high unemployment, where the quantity of
labor supplied appears to exceed the quantity of labor demanded. At such times, it appears that
wage rates do not adjust fast enough to equate the quantity of labor supplied and the quantity of
labor demanded.
Macroeconomic Concerns
Three of the major concerns of macroeconomics are
 Output growth
 Unemployment
 Inflation and deflation
Government policy makers would like to have high output growth, low unemployment, and low
inflation. We will see that these goals may conflict with one another and that an important point
in understanding macroeconomics is understanding these conflicts.
Output Growth 
Instead of growing at an even rate at all times, economies tend to experience short-term ups and
downs in their performance. The technical name for these ups and downs is the business cycle.
The main measure of how an economy is doing is aggregate output, the total quantity of goods
and services produced in the economy in a given period. When less is produced (in other words,
when aggregate output decreases), there are fewer goods and services to go around and the aver-
age standard of living declines. When firms cut back on production, they also lay off workers,
increasing the rate of unemployment.
Recessions are periods during which aggregate output declines. It has become conven-
tional to classify an economic downturn as a “recession” when aggregate output declines for two
consecutive quarters. A prolonged and deep recession is called a depression, although econo-
mists do not agree on when a recession becomes a depression. Since the 1930s the United States
has experienced one depression (during the 1930s) and eight recessions: 1946, 1954, 1958,
1974–1975, 1980–1982, 1990–1991, 2001, and 2008–2009. Other countries also experienced
recessions in the twentieth century, some roughly coinciding with U.S. recessions and some not.
A typical business cycle is illustrated in Figure 20.1. Since most economies, on average, grow
over time, the business cycle in Figure 20.1 shows a positive trend—the peak (the highest point)
of a new business cycle is higher than the peak of the previous cycle. The period from a trough, or
bottom of the cycle, to a peak is called an expansion or a boom. During an expansion, output
and employment grow. The period from a peak to a trough is called a contraction, recession, or
slump, when output and employment fall.
In judging whether an economy is expanding or contracting, note the difference between the
level of economic activity and its rate of change. If the economy has just left a trough (point A in
Figure 20.1), it will be growing (rate of change is positive), but its level of output will still be low.
If the economy has just started to decline from a peak (point B), it will be contracting (rate of
change is negative), but its level of output will still be high. In 2010 the U.S. economy was
expanding—it had left the trough of the 2008–2009 recession—but the level of output was still
low and many people were still out of work.
The business cycle in Figure 20.1 is symmetrical, which means that the length of an expan-
sion is the same as the length of a contraction. Most business cycles are not symmetrical, however.
It is possible, for example, for the expansion phase to be longer than the contraction phase. When
contraction comes, it may be fast and sharp, while expansion may be slow and gradual. Moreover,
the economy is not nearly as regular as the business cycle in Figure 20.1 indicates. The ups and
downs in the economy tend to be erratic.
Figure 20.2 shows the actual business cycles in the United States between 1900 and 2009.
Although many business cycles have occurred in the last 110 years, each is unique. The economy
is not so simple that it has regular cycles.
The periods of the Great Depression and World Wars I and II show the largest fluctuations in
Figure 20.2, although other large contractions and expansions have taken place. Note the expansion

in the 1960s and the five recessions since 1970. Some of the cycles have been long; some have been
very short. Note also that aggregate output actually increased between 1933 and 1937, even though
it was still quite low in 1937. The economy did not come out of the Depression until the defense
buildup prior to the start of World War II. Note also that business cycles were more extreme before
World War II than they have been since then.
Unemployment
You cannot listen to the news or read a newspaper without noticing that data on the unemploy-
ment rate are released each month. The unemployment rate—the percentage of the labor force
that is unemployed—is a key indicator of the economy’s health. Because the unemployment rate
is usually closely related to the economy’s aggregate output, announcements of each month’s new
figure are followed with great interest by economists, politicians, and policy makers.

PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics 
Although macroeconomists are interested in learning why the unemployment rate has risen
or fallen in a given period, they also try to answer a more basic question: Why is there any unem-
ployment at all? We do not expect to see zero unemployment. At any time, some firms may go
bankrupt due to competition from rivals, bad management, or bad luck. Employees of such firms
typically are not able to find new jobs immediately, and while they are looking for work, they will
be unemployed. Also, workers entering the labor market for the first time may require a few
weeks or months to find a job.
If we base our analysis on supply and demand, we would expect conditions to change in
response to the existence of unemployed workers. Specifically, when there is unemployment
beyond some minimum amount, there is an excess supply of workers—at the going wage rates,
there are people who want to work who cannot find work. In microeconomic theory, the
response to excess supply is a decrease in the price of the commodity in question and therefore
an increase in the quantity demanded, a reduction in the quantity supplied, and the restoration
of equilibrium. With the quantity supplied equal to the quantity demanded, the market clears.
The existence of unemployment seems to imply that the aggregate labor market is not in
equilibrium—that something prevents the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded from
equating. Why do labor markets not clear when other markets do, or is it that labor markets are
clearing and the unemployment data are reflecting something different? This is another main
concern of macroeconomists.
Inflation and Deflation
Inflation is an increase in the overall price level. Keeping inflation low has long been a goal of
government policy. Especially problematic are hyperinflations, or periods of very rapid increases
in the overall price level.
Most Americans are unaware of what life is like under very high inflation. In some countries
at some times, people were accustomed to prices rising by the day, by the hour, or even by the
minute. During the hyperinflation in Bolivia in 1984 and 1985, the price of one egg rose from
3,000 pesos to 10,000 pesos in 1 week. In 1985, three bottles of aspirin sold for the same price as
a luxury car had sold for in 1982. At the same time, the problem of handling money became a
burden. Banks stopped counting deposits—a $500 deposit was equivalent to about 32 million
pesos, and it just did not make sense to count a huge sack full of bills. Bolivia’s currency, printed
in West Germany and England, was the country’s third biggest import in 1984, surpassed only by
wheat and mining equipment.
Skyrocketing prices in Bolivia are a small part of the story. When inflation approaches rates
of 2,000 percent per year, the economy and the whole organization of a country begin to break
down. Workers may go on strike to demand wage increases in line with the high inflation rate,
and firms may find it hard to secure credit.
Hyperinflations are rare. Nonetheless, economists have devoted much effort to identifying
the costs and consequences of even moderate inflation. Does anyone gain from inflation? Who
loses? What costs does inflation impose on society? How severe are they? What causes inflation?
What is the best way to stop it? These are some of the main concerns of macroeconomists.
A decrease in the overall price level is called deflation. In some periods in U.S. history and
recently in Japan, deflation has occurred over an extended period of time. The goal of policy
makers is to avoid prolonged periods of deflation as well as inflation in order to pursue the
macroeconomic goal of stability.
The Components of the Macroeconomy
Understanding how the macroeconomy works can be challenging because a great deal is going
on at one time. Everything seems to affect everything else. To see the big picture, it is helpful to
divide the participants in the economy into four broad groups: (1) households, (2) firms, (3) the
government, and (4) the rest of the world. Households and firms make up the private sector, the
government is the public sector, and the rest of the world is the foreign sector. These four groups
interact in the economy in a variety of ways, many involving either receiving or paying income.

CHAPTER 20
Introduction to Macroeconomics 413
The Circular Flow Diagram
A useful way of seeing the economic interactions among the four groups in the economy is a
circular flow diagram, which shows the income received and payments made by each group. A
simple circular flow diagram is pictured in Figure 20.3.
Let us walk through the circular flow step by step. Households work for firms and the gov-
ernment, and they receive wages for their work. Our diagram shows a flow of wages into house-
holds as payment for those services. Households also receive interest on corporate and
government bonds and dividends from firms. Many households receive other payments from the
government, such as Social Security benefits, veterans’ benefits, and welfare payments.
Economists call these kinds of payments from the government (for which the recipients do not
supply goods, services, or labor) transfer payments. Together, these receipts make up the total
income received by the households.
Households spend by buying goods and services from firms and by paying taxes to the gov-
ernment. These items make up the total amount paid out by the households. The difference
between the total receipts and the total payments of the households is the amount that the house-
holds save or dissave. If households receive more than they spend, they save during the period. If
they receive less than they spend, they dissave. A household can dissave by using up some of its
previous savings or by borrowing. In the circular flow diagram, household spending is shown as
a flow out of households. Saving by households is sometimes termed a “leakage” from the circu-
lar flow because it withdraws income, or current purchasing power, from the system.
Firms sell goods and services to households and the government. These sales earn revenue,
which shows up in the circular flow diagram as a flow into the firm sector. Firms pay wages, inter-
est, and dividends to households, and firms pay taxes to the government. These payments are
shown flowing out of firms.

The Circular Flow 
of Payments
Households receive income from
firms and the government, pur-
chase goods and services from
firms, and pay taxes to the gov-
ernment. They also purchase
foreign-made goods and services
(imports). Firms receive pay-
ments from households and the
government for goods and ser-
vices; they pay wages, dividends,
interest, and rents to households
and taxes to the government.
The government receives taxes
from firms and households, pays
firms and households for goods
and services—including wages 
to government workers—and
pays interest and transfers to
households. Finally, people in
other countries purchase goods
and services produced domesti-
cally (exports).
Note: Although not shown in this
diagram, firms and governments also
purchase imports.

PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics 
The government collects taxes from households and firms. The government also makes pay-
ments. It buys goods and services from firms, pays wages and interest to households, and makes
transfer payments to households. If the government’s revenue is less than its payments, the gov-
ernment is dissaving.
Finally, households spend some of their income on imports—goods and services produced in
the rest of the world. Similarly, people in foreign countries purchase exports—goods and services
produced by domestic firms and sold to other countries.
One lesson of the circular flow diagram is that everyone’s expenditure is someone else’s
receipt. If you buy a personal computer from Dell, you make a payment to Dell and Dell receives
revenue. If Dell pays taxes to the government, it has made a payment and the government has
received revenue. Everyone’s expenditures go somewhere. It is impossible to sell something with-
out there being a buyer, and it is impossible to make a payment without there being a recipient.
Every transaction must have two sides.
The Three Market Arenas
Another way of looking at the ways households, firms, the government, and the rest of the world
relate to one another is to consider the markets in which they interact. We divide the markets into
three broad arenas: (1) the goods-and-services market, (2) the labor market, and (3) the money
(financial) market.
Goods-and-Services Market
Households and the government purchase goods and services
from firms in the goods-and-services market. In this market, firms also purchase goods and services
from each other. For example, Levi Strauss buys denim from other firms to make its blue jeans. In
addition,firms buy capital goods from other firms.If General Motors needs new robots on its assem-
bly lines, it may buy them from another firm instead of making them. The Economics in Practice in
Chapter 1 describes how Apple, in constructing its iPod, buys parts from a number of other firms.
Firms supply to the goods-and-services market. Households, the government, and firms
demand from this market. Finally, the rest of the world buys from and sells to the goods-and-
services market. The United States imports hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of automobiles,
DVDs, oil, and other goods. In the case of Apple’s iPod, inputs come from other firms located in
countries all over the world. At the same time, the United States exports hundreds of billions of
dollars’ worth of computers, airplanes, and agricultural goods.
Labor Market
Interaction in the labor market takes place when firms and the government
purchase labor from households. In this market, households supply labor and firms and the gov-
ernment demand labor. In the U.S. economy, firms are the largest demanders of labor, although
the government is also a substantial employer. The total supply of labor in the economy depends
on the sum of decisions made by households. Individuals must decide whether to enter the labor
force (whether to look for a job at all) and how many hours to work.
Labor is also supplied to and demanded from the rest of the world. In recent years, the labor
market has become an international market. For example, vegetable and fruit farmers in California
would find it very difficult to bring their product to market if it were not for the labor of migrant
farm workers from Mexico. For years, Turkey has provided Germany with “guest workers”who are
willing to take low-paying jobs that more prosperous German workers avoid. Call centers run by
major U.S. corporations are sometimes staffed by labor in India and other developing countries.
Money Market
In the money market—sometimes called the financial market—households
purchase stocks and bonds from firms. Households supply funds to this market in the expectation
of earning income in the form of dividends on stocks and interest on bonds. Households also
demand (borrow) funds from this market to finance various purchases. Firms borrow to build
new facilities in the hope of earning more in the future. The government borrows by issuing
bonds. The rest of the world borrows from and lends to the money market. Every morning there
are reports on TV and radio about the Japanese and British stock markets. Much of the borrow-
ing and lending of households, firms, the government, and the rest of the world are coordinated
by financial institutions—commercial banks, savings and loan associations, insurance compa-
nies, and the like. These institutions take deposits from one group and lend them to others.
When a firm, a household, or the government borrows to finance a purchase, it has an oblig-
ation to pay that loan back, usually at some specified time in the future. Most loans also involve

CHAPTER 20
Introduction to Macroeconomics 415
payment of interest as a fee for the use of the borrowed funds. When a loan is made, the borrower
usually signs a “promise to repay,” or promissory note, and gives it to the lender. When the federal
government borrows, it issues “promises” called Treasury bonds, notes, or bills in exchange for
money. Firms can borrow by issuing corporate bonds.
Instead of issuing bonds to raise funds, firms can also issue shares of stock. A share of stock
is a financial instrument that gives the holder a share in the firm’s ownership and therefore the
right to share in the firm’s profits. If the firm does well, the value of the stock increases and the
stockholder receives a capital gain1 on the initial purchase. In addition, the stock may pay
dividends—that is, the firm may return some of its profits directly to its stockholders instead of
retaining the profits to buy capital. If the firm does poorly, so does the stockholder. The capital
value of the stock may fall, and dividends may not be paid.
Stocks and bonds are simply contracts,or agreements,between parties.I agree to loan you a cer-
tain amount, and you agree to repay me this amount plus something extra at some future date, or I
agree to buy part ownership in your firm,and you agree to give me a share of the firm’s future profits.
A critical variable in the money market is the interest rate. Although we sometimes talk
as if there is only one interest rate, there is never just one interest rate at any time. Instead,
the interest rate on a given loan reflects the length of the loan and the perceived risk to the
lender. A business that is just getting started must pay a higher rate than General Motors
pays. A 30-year mortgage has a different interest rate than a 90-day loan. Nevertheless, inter-
est rates tend to move up and down together, and their movement reflects general conditions
in the financial market.
The Role of the Government in the Macroeconomy
The government plays a major role in the macroeconomy, so a useful way of learning how the
macroeconomy works is to consider how the government uses policy to affect the economy. The
two main policies are (1) fiscal policy and (2) monetary policy. Much of the study of macroeco-
nomics is learning how fiscal and monetary policies work.
Fiscal policy refers to the government’s decisions about how much to tax and spend. The
federal government collects taxes from households and firms and spends those funds on goods
and services ranging from missiles to parks to Social Security payments to interstate highways.
Taxes take the form of personal income taxes, Social Security taxes, and corporate profits taxes,
among others. An expansionary fiscal policy is a policy in which taxes are cut and/or government
spending increases. A contractionary fiscal policy is the reverse.
Monetary policy in the United States is controlled by the Federal Reserve, the nation’s 
central bank. The Fed, as it is usually called, determines the quantity of money in the economy,
which in turn affects interest rates. The Fed’s decisions have important effects on the economy. In
fact, the task of trying to smooth out business cycles in the United States is generally left to the
Fed (that is, to monetary policy). The chair of the Federal Reserve is sometimes said to be the sec-
ond most powerful person in the United States after the president. As we will see later in the text,
the Fed played a more active role in the 2008-2009 recession than it had in previous recessions.
Fiscal policy, however, also played a very active role in the 2008-2009 recession.
A Brief History of Macroeconomics
The severe economic contraction and high unemployment of the 1930s, the decade of the Great
Depression, spurred a great deal of thinking about macroeconomic issues, especially unemployment.
Figure 20.2 earlier in the chapter shows that this period had the largest and longest aggregate output
contraction in the twentieth century in the United States.The 1920s had been prosperous years for the
U.S. economy. Virtually everyone who wanted a job could get one, incomes rose substantially, and
prices were stable. Beginning in late 1929, things took a sudden turn for the worse. In 1929, 1.5 mil-
lion people were unemployed. By 1933, that had increased to 13 million out of a labor force of
51 million. In 1933, the United States produced about 27 percent fewer goods and services
than it had in 1929. In October 1929, when stock prices collapsed on Wall Street, billions of

have earned a capital gain of $500. A capital gain is “realized” when you sell the asset. Until you sell, the capital gain is accrued
but not realized.

dollars of personal wealth were lost. Unemployment remained above 14 percent of the labor force
until 1940. (See the Economics in Practice, p. 417,“Macroeconomics in Literature,”for Fitzgerald’s and
Steinbeck’s take on the 1920s and 1930s.)
Before the Great Depression, economists applied microeconomic models, sometimes
referred to as “classical” or “market clearing” models, to economy-wide problems. For example,
classical supply and demand analysis assumed that an excess supply of labor would drive down
wages to a new equilibrium level; as a result, unemployment would not persist.
In other words, classical economists believed that recessions were self-correcting. As output
falls and the demand for labor shifts to the left, the argument went, the wage rate will decline,
thereby raising the quantity of labor demanded by firms that will want to hire more workers at the
new lower wage rate. However, during the Great Depression, unemployment levels remained very
high for nearly 10 years. In large measure, the failure of simple classical models to explain the
prolonged existence of high unemployment provided the impetus for the development of macro-
economics. It is not surprising that what we now call macroeconomics was born in the 1930s.
One of the most important works in the history of economics, The General Theory of
Employment, Interest and Money, by John Maynard Keynes, was published in 1936. Building on
what was already understood about markets and their behavior, Keynes set out to construct a the-
ory that would explain the confusing economic events of his time.
Much of macroeconomics has roots in Keynes’s work. According to Keynes, it is not prices
and wages that determine the level of employment, as classical models had suggested; instead, it
is the level of aggregate demand for goods and services. Keynes believed that governments could
intervene in the economy and affect the level of output and employment. The government’s role
during periods when private demand is low, Keynes argued, is to stimulate aggregate demand
and, by so doing, to lift the economy out of recession. (Keynes was a larger-than-life figure, one
of the Bloomsbury group in England that included, among others, Virginia Woolf and Clive Bell.
See the Economics in Practice, p. 419, “John Maynard Keynes.”)
After World War II and especially in the 1950s, Keynes’s views began to gain increasing influence
over both professional economists and government policy makers. Governments came to believe
that they could intervene in their economies to attain specific employment and output goals.They
began to use their powers to tax and spend as well as their ability to affect interest rates and the
money supply for the explicit purpose of controlling the economy’s ups and downs.This view of gov-
ernment policy became firmly established in the United States with the passage of the Employment
Act of 1946. This act established the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, a group of econo-
mists who advise the president on economic issues. The act also committed the federal government
to intervening in the economy to prevent large declines in output and employment.
The notion that the government could and should act to stabilize the macroeconomy
reached the height of its popularity in the 1960s. During these years, Walter Heller, the chairman
of the Council of Economic Advisers under both President Kennedy and President Johnson,
alluded to fine-tuning as the government’s role in regulating inflation and unemployment.
During the 1960s, many economists believed the government could use the tools available to
manipulate unemployment and inflation levels fairly precisely.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. economy had wide fluctuations in employment, out-
put, and inflation. In 1974–1975 and again in 1980–1982, the United States experienced a severe
recession. Although not as catastrophic as the Great Depression of the 1930s, these two recessions
left millions without jobs and resulted in billions of dollars of lost output and income. In
1974–1975 and again in 1979–1981, the United States also saw very high rates of inflation.
The 1970s was thus a period of stagnation and high inflation, which came to be called
stagflation. Stagflation is defined as a situation in which there is high inflation at the same time
there are slow or negative output growth and high unemployment. Until the 1970s, high inflation
had been observed only in periods when the economy was prospering and unemployment was
low. The problem of stagflation was vexing both for macroeconomic theorists and policy makers
concerned with the health of the economy.
It was clear by 1975 that the macroeconomy was more difficult to control than Heller’s words
or textbook theory had led economists to believe. The events of the 1970s and early 1980s had an
important influence on macroeconomic theory. Much of the faith in the simple Keynesian model

Macroeconomics in Literature
As you know, the language of economics includes a heavy dose of
graphs and equations. But the underlying phenomena that econo-
mists study are the stuff of novels as well as graphs and equations.
The following two passages, from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott
Fitzgerald and The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, capture in
graphic, although not graphical, form the economic growth and
spending of the Roaring Twenties and the human side of the unem-
ployment of the Great Depression.
The Great Gatsby, written in 1925, is set in the 1920s, while The
Grapes of Wrath, written in 1939, is set in the early 1930s. If you look
at Figure 20.2 for these two periods, you will see the translation of
Fitzgerald and Steinbeck into macroeconomics.
From The Great Gatsby
At least once a
fortnight a corps
of caterers came
down with sev-
eral hundred feet
of canvas and
enough colored
lights to make 
a Christmas tree
of Gatsby’s enor-
mous 
garden.
On buffet tables,
garnished with
glistening hors d’œuvre, spiced baked hams crowded
against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and
turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar
with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with 
gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that 
most of his female guests were too young to know one
from another.
By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived—no thin five
piece affair but a whole pit full of oboes and trombones and
saxophones and viols  and cornets and piccolos and low and
high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach
now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are
parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons
and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in
strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile.
From The Grapes of Wrath
The 
moving,

were migrants
now. 
Those
families 
who
had lived on a
little piece of
land, who had
lived and died
on forty acres,
had eaten or

pered about, looking for work; and the highways were
streams of people, and the ditch banks were lines of people.
Behind them more were coming. The great highways
streamed with moving people.

and the “conventional wisdom” of the 1960s was lost. Although we are now 40 years past the
1970s, the discipline of macroeconomics is still in flux and there is no agreed-upon view of how
the macroeconomy works. Many important issues have yet to be resolved. This makes macroeco-
nomics hard to teach but exciting to study.
The U.S Economy Since 1970
In the following chapters, it will be useful to have a picture of how the U.S. economy has per-
formed in recent history. Since 1970, the U.S. economy has experienced five recessions and two
periods of high inflation. The period since 1970 is illustrated in Figures 20.4, 20.5, and 20.6.
These figures are based on quarterly data (that is, data for each quarter of the year). The first
quarter consists of January, February, and March; the second quarter consists of April, May, and
June; and so on. The Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV denote the four quarters. For example,
1972 III refers to the third quarter of 1972.

Aggregate output in the United States since 1970 has risen overall, but there have been five recessionary peri-
ods: 1974 I–1975 I, 1980 II–1982 IV, 1990 III–1991 I, 2001 I–2001 III, and 2008 I–2009 II.
Figure 20.4 plots aggregate output for 1970 I–2010 I. The five recessionary periods are 
1974 I–1975 I, 1980 II–1982 IV, 1990 III–1991 I, 2001 I–2001 III, and 2008 I–2009 II.2 These
five periods are shaded in the figure. Figure 20.5 plots the unemployment rate for the same over-
all period with the same shading for the recessionary periods. Note that unemployment rose in
all five recessions. In the 1974–1975 recession, the unemployment rate reached a maximum of
8.8 percent in the second quarter of 1975. During the 1980–1982 recession, it reached a maxi-
mum of 10.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982. The unemployment rate continued to rise
after the 1990–1991 recession and reached a peak of 7.6 percent in the third quarter of 1992. In
the 2008-2009 recession it reached a peak of 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.
2 Regarding the 1980 II–1982 IV period, output rose in 1980 IV and 1981 I before falling again in 1981 II.Given this fact, one
possibility would be to treat the 1980 II–1982 IV period as if it included two separate recessionary periods: 1980 II–1980 III
and 1981 I–1982 IV. Because the expansion was so short-lived, however, we have chosen not to separate the period into two
parts. These periods are close to but are not exactly the recessionary periods defined by the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER). The NBER is considered the “official” decider of recessionary periods. One problem with the NBER defini-
tions is that they are never revised, but the macro data are, sometimes by large amounts. This means that the NBER periods
are not always those that would be chosen using the latest revised data. In November 2008 the NBER declared that a recession
began in December 2007. In September 2010 it declared that the recession ended in June 2009.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
John Maynard Keynes
By 1933 the nation was virtually prostrate. On street corners,
in homes, in Hoovervilles (communities of makeshift shacks),
14 million unemployed sat, haunting the land....
It was the unemployment that was hardest to bear. The
jobless millions were like an embolism in the nation’s vital
circulation; and while their indisputable existence argued
more forcibly than any text that something was wrong with
the system, the economists wrung their hands and racked
their brains... but could offer neither diagnosis nor remedy.
Unemployment—this kind of unemployment—was simply
not listed among the possible ills of the system: it was
absurd, impossible, unreasonable, and paradoxical. But it
was there.
It would seem logical that the man who would seek to
solve this impossible paradox of not enough production
existing side by side with men fruitlessly seeking work would
be a Left-winger, an economist with strong sympathies for
the proletariat, an angry man. Nothing could be further from
the fact. The man who tackled it was almost a dilettante
with nothing like a chip on his shoulder. The simple truth
was that his talents inclined in every direction. He had, for
example, written a most recondite book on mathematical
probability, a book that Bertrand Russell had declared
“impossible to praise too highly”; then he had gone on to
match his skill in abstruse logic with a flair for making
money—he accumulated a fortune of £500,000 by way of
the most treacherous of all roads to riches: dealing in inter-
national currencies and commodities. More impressive yet,
he had written his mathematics treatise on the side, as it
were, while engaged in Government service, and he piled
up his private wealth by applying himself for only half an
hour a day while still abed.
But this is only a sample of his many-sidedness. He was an
economist, of course—a Cambridge don with all the dignity
and erudition that go with such an appointment.... He man-
aged to be simultaneously the darling of the Bloomsbury set,
the cluster of Britain’s most avant-garde intellectual brilliants,
and also the chairman of a life insurance company, a niche in
life rarely noted for its intellectual abandon. He was a pillar of
stability in delicate matters of
international diplomacy, but
his official correctness did
not prevent him from acquir-
ing a knowledge of other
European politicians that
included their... neuroses and
financial prejudices.... He ran
a theater, and he came to be
a Director of the Bank of
England. He knew Roosevelt
and 
Churchill 
and 
also
Bernard Shaw and Pablo
Picasso....
His name was John
Maynard Keynes, an old
British name (pronounced to rhyme with “rains”) that could be
traced back to one William de Cahagnes and 1066. Keynes
was a traditionalist; he liked to think that greatness ran in fam-
ilies, and it is true that his own father was John Neville Keynes,
an illustrious enough economist in his own right. But it took
more than the ordinary gifts of heritage to account for the son;
it was as if the talents that would have sufficed half a dozen
men were by happy accident crowded into one person.
By a coincidence he was born in 1883, in the very year
that Karl Marx passed away. But the two economists who
thus touched each other in time, although each was to
exert the profoundest influence on the philosophy of the
capitalist system, could hardly have differed from one
another more. Marx was bitter, at bay, heavy and disap-
pointed; as we know, he was the draftsman of Capitalism
Doomed. Keynes loved life and sailed through it buoyant, at
ease, and consummately successful to become the archi-
tect of Capitalism Viable.

CHAPTER 20
Introduction to Macroeconomics 419
Much of the framework of modern macroeconomics comes from
the works of John Maynard Keynes, whose General Theory of
Employment, Interest and Money was published in 1936. The 
following excerpt by Robert L. Heilbroner provides some insights
into Keynes’s life and work.
Figure 20.6 plots the inflation rate for 1970 I–2010 I. The two high inflation periods are
1973 IV–1975 IV and 1979 I–1981 IV, which are shaded. In the first high inflation period, the
inflation rate peaked at 11.1 percent in the first quarter of 1975. In the second high inflation
period, inflation peaked at 10.2 percent in the first quarter of 1981. Since 1983, the inflation
rate has been quite low by the standards of the 1970s. Since 1994, it has been between about 
1 and 3 percent.

PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics 
S U M M A R Y
1. Microeconomics examines the functioning of individual
industries and the behavior of individual decision-
making units. Macroeconomics is concerned with the 
sum, or aggregate, of these individual decisions—
the consumption of all households in the economy, the
amount of labor supplied and demanded by all individu-
als and firms, and the total amount of all goods and ser-
vices produced.
MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS p. 410
2. The three topics of primary concern to macroeconomists
are the growth rate of aggregate output; the level of
unemployment; and increases in the overall price level,
or inflation.
THE COMPONENTS OF THE MACROECONOMY p. 412
3. The circular flow diagram shows the flow of income
received and payments made by the four groups in the
economy—households, firms, the government, and 
the rest of the world. Everybody’s expenditure is 
someone else’s receipt—every transaction must have 
two sides.
4. Another way of looking at how households, firms, the gov-
ernment, and the rest of the world relate is to consider the
markets in which they interact: the goods-and-services market,
labor market, and money (financial) market.
5. Among the tools that the government has available 
for influencing the macroeconomy are fiscal policy (deci-
sions on taxes and government spending) and monetary
policy (control of the money supply, which affects 
interest rates).
A BRIEF HISTORY OF MACROECONOMICS p. 415
6. Macroeconomics was born out of the effort to explain the
Great Depression of the 1930s. Since that time, the disci-
pline has evolved, concerning itself with new issues as the
problems facing the economy have changed. Through the
late 1960s, it was believed that the government could
“fine-tune” the economy to keep it running on an even
keel at all times. The poor economic performance of
the 1970s, however, showed that fine-tuning does not
always work.
THE U.S. ECONOMY SINCE 1970 p. 417

1983 and 1992 was moderate. Since 1992, it has been fairly low.
In the following chapters, we will explain the behavior of and the connections among vari-
ables such as output, unemployment, and inflation. When you understand the forces at work in
creating the movements shown in Figures 20.4, 20.5, and 20.6, you will have come a long way in
understanding how the macroeconomy works.

1. Define inflation. Assume that you live in a simple economy in
which only three goods are produced and traded: fish, fruit, and
meat. Suppose that on January 1, 2010, fish sold for $2.50 per
pound, meat was $3.00 per pound, and fruit was $1.50 per pound.
At the end of the year, you discover that the catch was low and that
fish prices had increased to $5.00 per pound, but fruit prices
stayed at $1.50 and meat prices had actually fallen to $2.00. Can
you say what happened to the overall “price level”? How might you
construct a measure of the “change in the price level”? What addi-
tional information might you need to construct your measure?
2. Define unemployment. Should everyone who does not hold a
job be considered “unemployed”? To help with your answer,
draw a supply and demand diagram depicting the labor market.
What is measured along the demand curve? What factors deter-
mine the quantity of labor demanded during a given period?
What is measured along the labor supply curve? What factors
determine the quantity of labor supplied by households during
a given period? What is the opportunity cost of holding a job?
3. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 417] The Economics
in Practice describes prosperity and recession as they are depicted in
literature. In mid-2009, there was a debate about whether the U.S.
economy had entered an economic expansion. Look at the data on
real GDP growth and unemployment and describe the pattern
since 2007.You can find raw data on employment and unemploy-
ment at www.bls.gov, and you can find raw data on real GDP
growth at www.bea.gov. (In both cases, use the data described in
“Current Releases.”) Summarize what happened in mid-2009. Did
the United States enter an economic expansion? Explain.
4. A recession occurred in the U.S. economy during the first three
quarters of 2001. National output of goods and services fell dur-
ing this period. But during the fourth quarter of 2001, output
began to increase and it increased at a slow rate through the first
quarter of 2003. At the same time, between March 2001 and
April 2003, employment declined almost continuously with a
loss of over 2 million jobs. How is it possible that output rises
while at the same time employment is falling?
5. Describe the economy of your state. What is the most recently
reported unemployment rate? How has the number of payroll
jobs changed over the last 3 months and over the last year? How
does your state’s performance compare to the U.S. economy’s
performance over the last year? What explanations have been
offered in the press? How accurate are they?
6. Explain briefly how macroeconomics is different from microeco-
nomics. How can macroeconomists use microeconomic theory
to guide them in their work, and why might they want to do so?
7. During 1993 when the economy was growing very slowly,
President Clinton recommended a series of spending cuts and
tax increases designed to reduce the deficit. These were passed
by Congress in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.
Some who opposed the bill argue that the United States was
pursuing a “contractionary fiscal policy” at precisely the wrong
time. Explain their logic.
8. Many of the expansionary periods during the twentieth century
occurred during wars. Why do you think this is true?
9. In the 1940s, you could buy a soda for 5 cents, eat dinner at a
restaurant for less than $1, and purchase a house for $10,000.
From this statement, it follows that consumers today are worse
off than consumers in the 1940s. Comment.
10. [Related to Economics in Practice on p. 419] John Maynard
Keynes was the first to show that government policy could be used
to change aggregate output and prevent recessions by stabilizing
the economy. Describe the economy of the world at the time
Keynes was writing. Describe the economy of the United States
today. What measures were being proposed by the Presidential
candidates in the election of 2008 to prevent or end a recession in
2008-2009? Where the actions taken appropriate from the stand-
point of John Maynard Keynes? Did they have the desired effect?
11. In which of the three market arenas is each of the following
goods traded?
a. U.S. Treasury Bonds
b. An Amazon Kindle
c. A Harley-Davidson Softail motorcycle
d. The business knowledge of Dallas Mavericks’ owner 
Mark Cuban
e. Shares of Google stock
f. The crop-harvesting abilities of an orange picker in Florida
12. Assume that the demand for autoworkers declines significantly
due to a decrease in demand for new automobiles. Explain what
will happen to unemployment using both classical and
Keynesian reasoning.
13. Explain why the length and severity of the Great Depression
necessitated a fundamental rethinking of the operations of the
macroeconomy.

Measuring National
Output and National
Income
We saw in the last chapter that three
main concerns of macroeconomics
are aggregate output, unemploy-
ment, and inflation. In this chapter,
we discuss the measurement of
aggregate output and inflation. In
the next chapter, we discuss the
measurement of unemployment.
Accurate measures of these vari-
ables are critical for understanding
the economy. Without good mea-
sures, economists would have a
hard time analyzing how the econ-
omy works and policy makers
would have little to guide them on which policies are best for the economy.
Much of the macroeconomic data are from the national income and product accounts,
which are compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of
Commerce. It is hard to overestimate the importance of these accounts. They are, in fact, one of
the great inventions of the twentieth century. (See the Economics in Practice, p. 431.) They not
only convey data about the performance of the economy but also provide a conceptual frame-
work that macroeconomists use to think about how the pieces of the economy fit together. When
economists think about the macroeconomy, the categories and vocabulary they use come from
the national income and product accounts.
The national income and product accounts can be compared with the mechanical or wiring
diagrams for an automobile engine. The diagrams do not explain how an engine works, but they
identify the key parts of an engine and show how they are connected. Trying to understand the
macroeconomy without understanding national income accounting is like trying to fix an engine
without a mechanical diagram and with no names for the engine parts.
There are literally thousands of variables in the national income and product accounts. In
this chapter, we discuss only the most important. This chapter is meant to convey the way the
national income and product accounts represent or organize the economy and the sizes of the
various pieces of the economy.
Gross Domestic Product
The key concept in the national income and product accounts is gross domestic product (GDP).
gross domestic product
(GDP)
The total market
value of all final goods and
services produced within a
given period by factors of
production located within 
a country.
GDP is the total market value of a country’s output. It is the market value of all final goods
and services produced within a given period of time by factors of production located
within a country.
U.S. GDP for 2009—the value of all output produced by factors of production in the United
States in 2009—was $14,256.3 billion.

PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics 
final goods and services
Goods and services produced
for final use.
intermediate goods
Goods
that are produced by one firm
for use in further processing by
another firm.
value added
The difference
between the value of goods 
as they leave a stage of
production and the cost of
the goods as they entered
that stage.
In calculating GDP, we can sum up the value added at each stage of production or we can
take the value of final sales. We do not use the value of total sales in an economy to measure
how much output has been produced.
Exclusion of Used Goods and Paper Transactions
GDP is concerned only with new, or current, production. Old output is not counted in current
GDP because it was already counted when it was produced. It would be double counting to count
sales of used goods in current GDP. If someone sells a used car to you, the transaction is not
counted in GDP because no new production has taken place. Similarly, a house is counted in
GDP only at the time it is built, not each time it is resold. In short:
GDP does not count transactions in which money or goods changes hands but in which no
new goods and services are produced.
GDP is a critical concept. Just as an individual firm needs to evaluate the success or failure of
its operations each year, so the economy as a whole needs to assess itself. GDP, as a measure of the
total production of an economy, provides us with a country’s economic report card. Because
GDP is so important, we need to take time to explain exactly what its definition means.
Final Goods and Services
First, note that the definition refers to final goods and services. Many goods produced in the
economy are not classified as final goods, but instead as intermediate goods. Intermediate goods
are produced by one firm for use in further processing by another firm. For example, tires sold to
automobile manufacturers are intermediate goods. The parts that go in Apple’s iPod are also
intermediate goods. The value of intermediate goods is not counted in GDP.
Why are intermediate goods not counted in GDP? Suppose that in producing a car, General
Motors (GM) pays $200 to Goodyear for tires. GM uses these tires (among other components) to
assemble a car, which it sells for $24,000. The value of the car (including its tires) is $24,000, not
$24,000 + $200. The final price of the car already reflects the value of all its components. To count
in GDP both the value of the tires sold to the automobile manufacturers and the value of the
automobiles sold to the consumers would result in double counting.
Double counting can also be avoided by counting only the value added to a product by each
firm in its production process. The value added during some stage of production is the difference
between the value of goods as they leave that stage of production and the cost of the goods as they
entered that stage. Value added is illustrated in Table 21.1. The four stages of the production of a
gallon of gasoline are: (1) oil drilling, (2) refining, (3) shipping, and (4) retail sale. In the first stage,
value added is the value of the crude oil. In the second stage, the refiner purchases the oil from the
driller, refines it into gasoline, and sells it to the shipper. The refiner pays the driller $3.00 per gallon
and charges the shipper $3.30. The value added by the refiner is thus $0.30 per gallon. The shipper
then sells the gasoline to retailers for $3.60. The value added in the third stage of production is
$0.30. Finally, the retailer sells the gasoline to consumers for $4.00. The value added at the fourth
stage is $0.40; and the total value added in the production process is $4.00, the same as the value of
sales at the retail level. Adding the total values of sales at each stage of production ($3.00 + $3.30 +
$3.60 + $4.00 = $13.90) would significantly overestimate the value of the gallon of gasoline.

CHAPTER 21
Measuring National Output and National Income 425
Sales of stocks and bonds are not counted in GDP. These exchanges are transfers of owner-
ship of assets, either electronically or through paper exchanges, and do not correspond to current
production. However, what if you sell the stock or bond for more than you originally paid for it?
Profits from the stock or bond market have nothing to do with current production, so they are
not counted in GDP. However, if you pay a fee to a broker for selling a stock of yours to someone
else, this fee is counted in GDP because the broker is performing a service for you. This service is
part of current production. Be careful to distinguish between exchanges of stocks and bonds for
money (or for other stocks and bonds), which do not involve current production, and fees for
performing such exchanges, which do.
Exclusion of Output Produced Abroad by Domestically
Owned Factors of Production
GDP is the value of output produced by factors of production located within a country.
The three basic factors of production are land,labor,and capital.The labor of U.S.citizens counts
as a domestically owned factor of production for the United States. The output produced by U.S. citi-
zens abroad—for example, U.S. citizens working for a foreign company—is not counted in U.S. GDP
because the output is not produced within the United States. Likewise, profits earned abroad by U.S.
companies are not counted in U.S. GDP. However, the output produced by foreigners working in the
United States is counted in U.S. GDP because the output is produced within the United States. Also,
profits earned in the United States by foreign-owned companies are counted in U.S. GDP.
It is sometimes useful to have a measure of the output produced by factors of production
owned by a country’s citizens regardless of where the output is produced. This measure is called
gross national product (GNP). For most countries, including the United States, the difference
between GDP and GNP is small. In 2009, GNP for the United States was $14,361.2 billion, which
is close to the $14,256.3 billion value for U.S. GDP.
The distinction between GDP and GNP can be tricky. Consider the Honda plant in
Marysville, Ohio. The plant is owned by the Honda Corporation, a Japanese firm, but most of the
workers employed at the plant are U.S. workers. Although all the output of the plant is included
in U.S. GDP, only part of it is included in U.S. GNP. The wages paid to U.S. workers are part of
U.S. GNP, while the profits from the plant are not. The profits from the plant are counted in
Japanese GNP because this is output produced by Japanese-owned factors of production
(Japanese capital in this case). The profits, however, are not counted in Japanese GDP because
they were not earned in Japan.
Calculating GDP
GDP can be computed two ways. One way is to add up the total amount spent on all final
goods and services during a given period. This is the expenditure approach to calculating
GDP. The other way is to add up the income—wages, rents, interest, and profits—received by
all factors of production in producing final goods and services. This is the income approach to
calculating GDP. These two methods lead to the same value for GDP for the reason we dis-
cussed in the previous chapter: Every payment (expenditure) by a buyer is at the same time a
receipt (income) for the seller. We can measure either income received or expenditures made,
and we will end up with the same total output.
Suppose the economy is made up of just one firm and the firm’s total output this year sells for
$1 million. Because the total amount spent on output this year is $1 million, this year’s GDP is $1 mil-
lion.(Remember: The expenditure approach calculates GDP on the basis of the total amount spent on
final goods and services in the economy.) However, every one of the million dollars of GDP either is
paid to someone or remains with the owners of the firm as profit. Using the income approach, we add
up the wages paid to employees of the firm, the interest paid to those who lent money to the firm, and
the rents paid to those who leased land, buildings, or equipment to the firm.What is left over is profit,
which is,of course,income to the owners of the firm.If we add up the incomes of all the factors of pro-
duction,including profits to the owners,we get a GDP of $1 million.

PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics 
The Expenditure Approach
Recall from the previous chapter the four main groups in the economy: households, firms, the
government, and the rest of the world. There are also four main categories of expenditure:
 Personal consumption expenditures (C): household spending on consumer goods
 Gross private domestic investment (I): spending by firms and households on new capital,
that is, plant, equipment, inventory, and new residential structures
 Government consumption and gross investment (G)
 Net exports (EX - IM): net spending by the rest of the world, or exports (EX) minus
imports (IM)
The expenditure approach calculates GDP by adding together these four components of
spending. It is shown here in equation form:
GDP = C + I + G + (EX - IM)
U.S. GDP was $14,256.3 billion in 2009. The four components of the expenditure approach
are shown in Table 21.2, along with their various categories.

Personal Consumption Expenditures (C)
The largest part of GDP consists of
personal consumption expenditures (C). Table 21.2 shows that in 2009, the amount of personal
consumption expenditures accounted for 70.8 percent of GDP. These are expenditures by con-
sumers on goods and services.
There are three main categories of consumer expenditures: durable goods, nondurable
goods, and services. Durable goods, such as automobiles, furniture, and household appliances,
last a relatively long time. Nondurable goods, such as food, clothing, gasoline, and cigarettes, are
used up fairly quickly. Payments for services—those things we buy that do not involve the pro-
duction of physical items—include expenditures for doctors, lawyers, and educational institu-
tions. As Table 21.2 shows, in 2009, durable goods expenditures accounted for 7.3 percent of
GDP, nondurables for 15.6 percent, and services for 47.9 percent. Almost half of GDP is now ser-
vice consumption.

CHAPTER 21
Measuring National Output and National Income 427
gross private domestic
investment (I)
Total
investment in capital—that is,
the purchase of new housing,
plants, equipment, and
inventory by the private (or
nongovernment) sector.
nonresidential investment
Expenditures by firms for
machines, tools, plants, and 
so on.
residential investment
Expenditures by households
and firms on new houses and
apartment buildings.
change in business
inventories
The amount by
which firms’ inventories change
during a period. Inventories are
the goods that firms produce
now but intend to sell later.
1 The distinction between what is considered investment and what is considered consumption is sometimes fairly arbitrary. A
firm’s purchase of a car or a truck is counted as investment, but a household’s purchase of a car or a truck is counted as con-
sumption of durable goods. In general, expenditures by firms for items that last longer than a year are counted as investment
expenditures. Expenditures for items that last less than a year are seen as purchases of intermediate goods.
Gross Private Domestic Investment (I )
Investment, as we use the term in economics,
refers to the purchase of new capital—housing, plants, equipment, and inventory. The economic
use of the term is in contrast to its everyday use, where investment often refers to purchases of
stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
Total investment in capital by the private sector is called gross private domestic investment (I).
Expenditures by firms for machines, tools, plants, and so on make up nonresidential
investment.1 Because these are goods that firms buy for their own final use, they are part of “final
sales” and counted in GDP. Expenditures for new houses and apartment buildings constitute
residential investment. The third component of gross private domestic investment, the change
in business inventories, is the amount by which firms’ inventories change during a period.
Business inventories can be looked at as the goods that firms produce now but intend to sell later.
In 2009, gross private domestic investment accounted for 11.4 percent of GDP. Of that, 9.7 per-
cent was nonresidential investment, 2.5 percent was residential investment, and –0.8 percent was
change in business inventories.
Change in Business Inventories
Why is the change in business inventories considered a
component of investment—the purchase of new capital? To run a business most firms hold
inventories. Publishing firms print more books than they expect to sell instantly so that they can
ship them quickly once they do get orders. Inventories—goods produced for later sale—are
counted as capital because they produce value in the future. An increase in inventories is an
increase in capital.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Where Does eBay Get Counted? 
eBay runs an online marketplace with over 220 million regis-
tered users who buy and sell 2.4 billion items a year, ranging
from children’s toys to oil paintings. In December 2007, one
eBay user auctioned off a 1933 Chicago World’s Fair pen-
nant. The winning bid was just over $20.
eBay is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, employs
hundreds of people, and has a market value of about $40 bil-
lion. With regard to eBay, what do you think gets counted as
part of current GDP? 
That 1933 pennant, for example, does not get counted. The
production of that pennant was counted back in 1933.The many
cartons of K’nex bricks sent from one home to another don’t
count either. Their value was counted when the bricks were first
produced. What about a newly minted Scrabble game? One of
the interesting features of eBay is that it has changed from being
a market in which individuals market their hand-me-downs to a
place that small and even large businesses use as a sales site. The
value of the new Scrabble game would be counted as part of this
year’s GDP if it were produced this year.
So do any of eBay’s services count as part of GDP?
eBay’s business is to provide a marketplace for exchange.
In doing so, it uses labor and capital and creates value. In
return for creating this value, eBay charges fees to the
sellers that use its site. The value of these fees do enter into
GDP. So while the old knickknacks that people sell on eBay
do not contribute to current GDP, the cost of finding 
an interested buyer for those old goods does indeed 
get counted.

428
PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics 
Regarding GDP, remember that it is not the market value of total final sales during the
period, but rather the market value of total final production. The relationship between total pro-
duction and total sales is as follows:
GDP = Final sales + Change in business inventories
Total production (GDP) equals final sales of domestic goods plus the change in business inventories.
In 2009, production in the United States was smaller than sales by $120.9 billion. The stock of
inventories at the end of 2009 was $120.9 billion smaller than it was at the end of 2008—the
change in business inventories was –$120.9 billion.
Gross Investment versus Net Investment
During the process of production, capital (espe-
cially machinery and equipment) produced in previous periods gradually wears out. GDP does
not give us a true picture of the real production of an economy. GDP includes newly produced
capital goods but does not take account of capital goods “consumed” in the production process.
Capital assets decline in value over time. The amount by which an asset’s value falls each
period is called its depreciation.2 A personal computer purchased by a business today may be
expected to have a useful life of 4 years before becoming worn out or obsolete. Over that period,
the computer steadily depreciates.
What is the relationship between gross investment (I) and depreciation? Gross investment
is the total value of all newly produced capital goods (plant, equipment, housing, and inven-
tory) produced in a given period. It takes no account of the fact that some capital wears out
and must be replaced. Net investment is equal to gross investment minus depreciation. Net
investment is a measure of how much the stock of capital changes during a period. Positive net
investment means that the amount of new capital produced exceeds the amount that wears
out, and negative net investment means that the amount of new capital produced is less than
the amount that wears out. Therefore, if net investment is positive, the capital stock has
increased, and if net investment is negative, the capital stock has decreased. Put another way,
the capital stock at the end of a period is equal to the capital stock that existed at the beginning
of the period plus net investment:
depreciation
The amount by
which an asset’s value falls in a
given period.
gross investment
The total
value of all newly produced
capital goods (plant,
equipment, housing, and
inventory) produced in a 
given period.
net investment
Gross
investment minus depreciation.
capitalend of period = capitalbeginning of period + net investment
Government Consumption and Gross Investment (G)
Government 
consumption and gross investment (G) include expenditures by federal, state, and local
governments for final goods (bombs, pencils, school buildings) and services (military salaries,
congressional salaries, school teachers’ salaries). Some of these expenditures are counted as
government consumption, and some are counted as government gross investment.
Government transfer payments (Social Security benefits, veterans’ disability stipends, and so
on) are not included in G because these transfers are not purchases of anything currently pro-
duced. The payments are not made in exchange for any goods or services. Because interest
payments on the government debt are also counted as transfers, they are excluded from GDP
on the grounds that they are not payments for current goods or services.
As Table 21.2 shows, government consumption and gross investment accounted for
$2,930.7 billion, or 20.5 percent of U.S. GDP, in 2009. Federal government consumption and
gross investment accounted for 8.0 percent of GDP, and state and local government consump-
tion and gross investment accounted for 12.5 percent.
government consumption and
gross investment (G)
Expenditures by federal, state,
and local governments for final
goods and services.
2 This is the formal definition of economic depreciation. Because depreciation is difficult to measure precisely, accounting rules
allow firms to use shortcut methods to approximate the amount of depreciation that they incur each period. To complicate mat-
ters even more, the U.S. tax laws allow firms to deduct depreciation for tax purposes under a different set of rules.

CHAPTER 21
Measuring National Output and National Income 429
net exports (EX – IM)
The
difference between exports
(sales to foreigners of U.S.-
produced goods and services)
and imports (U.S. purchases of
goods and services from
abroad). The figure can be
positive or negative.
Net Exports (EX - IM)
The value of net exports (EX - IM) is the difference between exports
(sales to foreigners of U.S.-produced goods and services) and imports (U.S. purchases of goods and
services from abroad).This figure can be positive or negative.In 2009,the United States exported less
than it imported, so the level of net exports was negative (-$392.4 billion). Before 1976, the United
States was generally a net exporter—exports exceeded imports, so the net export figure was positive.
The reason for including net exports in the definition of GDP is simple. Consumption, invest-
ment,and government spending (C,I,and G,respectively) include expenditures on goods produced
at home and abroad.Therefore,C + I + G overstates domestic production because it contains expen-
ditures on foreign-produced goods—that is, imports (IM), which have to be subtracted from GDP
to obtain the correct figure. At the same time, C + I + G understates domestic production because
some of what a nation produces is sold abroad and therefore is not included in C, I, or G—exports
(EX) have to be added in.If a U.S.firm produces computers and sells them in Germany,the comput-
ers are part of U.S. production and should be counted as part of U.S. GDP.
The Income Approach
We now turn to calculating GDP using the income approach, which looks at GDP in terms of
who receives it as income rather than as who purchases it.
We begin with the concept of national income,which is defined in Table 21.3.National income
is the sum of eight income items. Compensation of employees, the largest of the eight items by far,
includes wages and salaries paid to households by firms and by the government, as well as various
supplements to wages and salaries such as contributions that employers make to social insurance
and private pension funds. Proprietors’ income is the income of unincorporated businesses.
Rental income, a minor item, is the income received by property owners in the form of rent.
Corporate profits, the second-largest item of the eight, is the income of corporations. Net interest
is the interest paid by business. (Interest paid by households and the government is not counted in
GDP because it is not assumed to flow from the production of goods and services.)

The sixth item, indirect taxes minus subsidies, includes taxes such as sales taxes, customs
duties, and license fees less subsidies that the government pays for which it receives no goods or
services in return. (Subsidies are like negative taxes.) The value of indirect taxes minus subsidies
is thus net income received by the government. Net business transfer payments are net transfer
payments by businesses to others and are thus income of others. The final item is the surplus of
government enterprises, which is the income of government enterprises. Table 21.3 shows that
this item was negative in 2009: government enterprises on net ran at a loss.
National income is the total income of the country, but it is not quite GDP. Table 21.4 shows
what is involved in going from national income to GDP. Table 21.4 first shows that in moving from
gross domestic product (GDP) to gross national product (GNP), we need to add receipts of factor
income from the rest of the world and subtract payments of factor income to the rest of the world.
National income is income of the country’s citizens, not the income of the residents of the country.
So we first need to move from GDP to GNP. This, as discussed earlier, is a minor adjustment.

We then need to subtract depreciation from GNP, which is a large adjustment. GNP less depre-
ciation is called net national product (NNP). Why is depreciation subtracted? To see why, go back
to the example earlier in this chapter in which the economy is made up of just one firm and total
output (GDP) for the year is $1 million. Assume that after the firm pays wages, interest, and rent, it
has $100,000 left.Assume also that its capital stock depreciated by $40,000 during the year. National
income includes corporate profits (see Table 21.3), and in calculating corporate profits, the $40,000
depreciation is subtracted from the $100,000, leaving profits of $60,000. So national income does
not include the $40,000. When we calculate GDP using the expenditure approach, depreciation is
not subtracted.We simply add consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. In
our simple example, this is just $1 million. We thus must subtract depreciation from GDP (actually
GNP when there is a rest-of-the-world sector) to get national income.
Table 21.4 shows that net national product and national income are the same except for a
statistical discrepancy, a data measurement error. If the government were completely accurate in its
data collection, the statistical discrepancy would be zero. The data collection, however, is not perfect,
and the statistical discrepancy is the measurement error in each period.Table 21.4 shows that in 2009,
this error was $217.3 billion, which is small compared to national income of $12,280.0 billion.
We have so far seen from Table 21.3 the various income items that make up total national
income, and we have seen from Table 21.4 how GDP and national income are related. A use-
ful way to think about national income is to consider how much of it goes to households. The
total income of households is called personal income, and it turns out that almost all of
national income is personal income. Table 21.5 shows that of the $12,280.0 billion in national
income in 2009, $12,019.0 billion was personal income. Although not shown in Table 21.5,
one of the differences between national income and personal income is the profits of corpora-
tions not paid to households in the form of dividends, called the retained earnings of corpora-
tions. This is income that goes to corporations rather than to households, and so it is part of
national income but not personal income.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
GDP: One of the Great Inventions of the 20th Century 
As the 20th century drew to a close, the U.S. Department of Commerce
embarked on a review of its achievements. At the conclusion of this
review,the Department named the development of the national income
and product accounts as “its achievement of the century.”
J. Steven Landefeld Director, Bureau of Economic Analysis
While the GDP and the rest of the national income accounts may
seem to be arcane concepts, they are truly among the great inven-
tions of the twentieth century.
Paul A. Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus
GDP! The right concept of economy-wide output, accurately
measured. The U.S. and the world rely on it to tell where we are
in the business cycle and to estimate long-run growth. It is the
centerpiece of an elaborate and indispensable system of social
accounting, the national income and product accounts. This is
surely the single most innovative achievement of the Commerce
Department in the 20th century. I was fortunate to become an
economist in the 1930’s when Kuznets, Nathan, Gilbert, and Jaszi
were creating this most important set of economic time series. In
economic theory, macroeconomics was just beginning at the
same time. Complementary, these two innovations deserve much
credit for the improved performance of the economy in the sec-
ond half of the century.
James Tobin
FROM THE SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS
Prior to the development of the NIPAs [national income and prod-
uct accounts], policy makers had to guide the economy using lim-
ited and fragmentary information about the state of the economy.
The Great Depression underlined the problems of incomplete data
and led to the development of the national accounts:
One reads with dismay of Presidents Hoover and then Roosevelt
designing policies to combat the Great Depression of the 1930s on
the basis of such sketchy data as stock price indices,freight car load-
ings, and incomplete indices of industrial production. The fact was
that comprehensive measures of national income and output did
not exist at the time. The Depression, and with it the growing role
of government in the economy, emphasized the need for such mea-
sures and led to the development of a comprehensive set of national
income accounts.
Richard T. Froyen
In response to this need in the 1930s, the Department of
Commerce commissioned Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets of the
National Bureau of Economic Research to develop a set of national
economic accounts....Professor Kuznets coordinated the work of
researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research in New
York and his staff at Commerce. The original set of accounts was
presented in a report to Congress in 1937 and in a research report,
National Income, 1929–35....
The national accounts have become the mainstay of modern
macroeconomic analysis, allowing policy makers, economists, and the
business community to analyze the impact of different tax and spend-
ing plans, the impact of oil and other price shocks, and the impact of
monetary policy on the economy as a whole and on specific compo-
nents of final demand, incomes, industries, and regions....

CHAPTER 21
Measuring National Output and National Income 431
Personal income is the income received by households before they pay personal income taxes.
The amount of income that households have to spend or save is called disposable personal
income, or after-tax income. It is equal to personal income minus personal income taxes, as
shown in Table 21.5.
Because disposable personal income is the amount of income that households can spend
or save, it is an important income concept. Table 21.5 on p. 430 shows there are three cate-
gories of spending: (1) personal consumption expenditures, (2) personal interest payments,
and (3) transfer payments made by households. The amount of disposable personal income
left after total personal spending is personal saving. If your monthly disposable income is
$500 and you spend $450, you have $50 left at the end of the month. Your personal saving is
$50 for the month. Your personal saving level can be negative: If you earn $500 and spend
$600 during the month, you have dissaved $100. To spend $100 more than you earn, you will
have to borrow the $100 from someone, take the $100 from your savings account, or sell an
asset you own.

PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics 
The personal saving rate is the percentage of disposable personal income saved, an
important indicator of household behavior. A low saving rate means households are spending
a large fraction of their income. A high saving rate means households are cautious in their
spending. As Table 21.5 shows, the U.S. personal saving rate in 2009 was 4.2 percent. Saving
rates tend to rise during recessionary periods, when consumers become anxious about their
future, and fall during boom times, as pent-up spending demand gets released. In 2005 the sav-
ing rate got down to 1.4 percent.
Nominal versus Real GDP
We have thus far looked at GDP measured in current dollars, or the current prices we pay for
goods and services. When we measure something in current dollars, we refer to it as a nominal
value. Nominal GDP is GDP measured in current dollars—all components of GDP valued at
their current prices.
In most applications in macroeconomics, however, nominal GDP is not what we are
after. It is not a good measure of aggregate output over time. Why? Assume that there is only
one good—say, pizza, which is the same quality year after year. In each year 1 and 2, 100 units
(slices) of pizza were produced. Production thus remained the same for year 1 and year 2.
Suppose the price of pizza increased from $1.00 per slice in year 1 to $1.10 per slice in year 2.
Nominal GDP in year 1 is $100 (100 units  $1.00 per unit), and nominal GDP in year 2 is
$110 (100 units  $1.10 per unit). Nominal GDP has increased by $10 even though no more
slices of pizza were produced. If we use nominal GDP to measure growth, we can be misled
into thinking production has grown when all that has really happened is a rise in the price
level (inflation).
If there were only one good in the economy—for example, pizza—it would be easy to
measure production and compare one year’s value to another’s. We would add up all the pizza
slices produced each year. In the example, production is 100 in both years. If the number of
slices had increased to 105 in year 2, we would say production increased by 5 slices between
year 1 and year 2, which is a 5 percent increase. Alas, however, there is more than one good in
the economy.
The following is a discussion of how the BEA adjusts nominal GDP for price changes. As you
read the discussion, keep in mind that this adjustment is not easy. Even in an economy of just
apples and oranges, it would not be obvious how to add up apples and oranges to get an overall
measure of output. The BEA’s task is to add up thousands of goods, each of whose price is changing
over time.
In the following discussion, we will use the concept of a weight, either price weights or quantity
weights. What is a weight? It is easiest to define the term by an example. Suppose in your economics
course there is a final exam and two other tests. If the final exam counts for one-half of the grade and
the other two tests for one-fourth each, the “weights” are one-half, one-fourth, and one-fourth. If
instead the final exam counts for 80 percent of the grade and the other two tests for 10 percent each,
the weights are .8, .1, and .1. The more important an item is in a group, the larger its weight.
Calculating Real GDP
Nominal GDP adjusted for price changes is called real GDP. All the main issues involved in com-
puting real GDP can be discussed using a simple three-good economy and 2 years. Table 21.6 pre-
sents all the data that we will need. The table presents price and quantity data for 2 years and
three goods. The goods are labeled A, B, and C, and the years are labeled 1 and 2. P denotes price,
and Q denotes quantity. Keep in mind that everything in the following discussion, including the
discussion of the GDP deflation, is based on the numbers in Table 21.6. Nothing has been
brought in from the outside. The table is the entire economy.
The first thing to note from Table 21.6 is that nominal output—in current dollars—in year 1
for good A is the price of good A in year 1 ($0.50) times the number of units of good A produced

in year 1 (6), which is $3.00. Similarly, nominal output in year 1 is 7  $0.30 = $2.10 for good B
and 10  $0.70 = $7.00 for good C. The sum of these three amounts, $12.10 in column 5, is nom-
inal GDP in year 1 in this simple economy. Nominal GDP in year 2—calculated by using the year
2 quantities and the year 2 prices—is $19.20 (column 8). Nominal GDP has risen from $12.10 in
year 1 to $19.20 in year 2, an increase of 58.7 percent.3
You can see that the price of each good changed between year 1 and year 2—the price of
good A fell (from $0.50 to $0.40) and the prices of goods B and C rose (B from $0.30 to
$1.00; C from $0.70 to $0.90). Some of the change in nominal GDP between years 1 and 2 is
due to price changes and not production changes. How much can we attribute to price
changes and how much to production changes? Here things get tricky. The procedure that
the BEA used prior to 1996 was to pick a base year and to use the prices in that base year as
weights to calculate real GDP. This is a fixed-weight procedure because the weights used,
which are the prices, are the same for all years—namely, the prices that prevailed in the 
base year.
Let us use the fixed-weight procedure and year 1 as the base year, which means using year 1
prices as the weights. Then in Table 21.6, real GDP in year 1 is $12.10 (column 5) and real GDP in
year 2 is $15.10 (column 6). Note that both columns use year 1 prices and that nominal and real
GDP are the same in year 1 because year 1 is the base year. Real GDP has increased from $12.10 to
$15.10, an increase of 24.8 percent.
Let us now use the fixed-weight procedure and year 2 as the base year, which means using
year 2 prices as the weights. In Table 21.6, real GDP in year 1 is $18.40 (column 7) and real GDP
in year 2 is $19.20 (column 8). Note that both columns use year 2 prices and that nominal and
real GDP are the same in year 2 because year 2 is the base year. Real GDP has increased from
$18.40 to $19.20, an increase of 4.3 percent.
This example shows that growth rates can be sensitive to the choice of the base year—
24.8 percent using year 1 prices as weights and 4.3 percent using year 2 prices as weights. The old
BEA procedure simply picked one year as the base year and did all the calculations using the
prices in that year as weights. The new BEA procedure makes two important changes. The first
(using the current example) is to take the average of the two years’ price changes, in other words,
to “split the difference”between 24.8 percent and 4.3 percent. What does “splitting the difference”
mean? One way is to take the average of the two numbers, which is 14.55 percent. What the BEA

does is to take the geometric average, which for the current example is 14.09 percent.4 These two
averages (14.55 percent and 14.09 percent) are quite close, and the use of either would give simi-
lar results. The point here is not that the geometric average is used, but that the first change is to
split the difference using some average. Note that this new procedure requires two “base” years
because 24.8 percent was computed using year 1 prices as weights and 4.3 percent was computed
using year 2 prices as weights.
The second BEA change is to use years 1 and 2 as the base years when computing the per-
centage change between years 1 and 2, then use years 2 and 3 as the base years when computing
the percentage change between years 2 and 3, and so on. The two base years change as the calcu-
lations move through time. The series of percentage changes computed this way is taken to be the
series of growth rates of real GDP. So in this way, nominal GDP is adjusted for price changes. To
make sure you understand this, review the calculations in Table 21.6, which provides all the data
you need to see what is going on.
Calculating the GDP Deflator
We now switch gears from real GDP, a quantity measure, to the GDP deflator, a price measure.
One of economic policy makers’ goals is to keep changes in the overall price level small. For this
reason, policy makers not only need good measures of how real output is changing but also
good measures of how the overall price level is changing. The GDP deflator is one measure of
the overall price level. We can use the data in Table 21.6 to show how the BEA computes the
GDP deflator.
In Table 21.6, the price of good A fell from $0.50 in year 1 to $0.40 in year 2, the price of
good B rose from $0.30 to $1.00, and the price of good C rose from $0.70 to $0.90. If we are
interested only in how individual prices change, this is all the information we need. However, if
we are interested in how the overall price level changes, we need to weight the individual prices
in some way. The obvious weights to use are the quantities produced, but which quantities—
those of year 1 or year 2? The same issues arise here for the quantity weights as for the price
weights in computing real GDP.
Let us first use the fixed-weight procedure and year 1 as the base year, which means using
year 1 quantities as the weights. Then in Table 21.6, the “bundle” price in year 1 is $12.10 (col-
umn 5) and the bundle price in year 2 is $18.40 (column 7). Both columns use year 1 quantities.
The bundle price has increased from $12.10 to $18.40, an increase of 52.1 percent.
Next, use the fixed-weight procedure and year 2 as the base year, which means using 
year 2 quantities as the weights. Then the bundle price in year 1 is $15.10 (column 6), and the
bundle price in year 2 is $19.20 (column 8). Both columns use year 2 quantities. The bundle price
has increased from $15.10 to $19.20, an increase of 27.2 percent.
This example shows that overall price increases can be sensitive to the choice of the base
year: 52.1 percent using year 1 quantities as weights and 27.2 percent using year 2 quantities
as weights. Again, the old BEA procedure simply picked one year as the base year and did all
the calculations using the quantities in the base year as weights. First, the new procedure
splits the difference between 52.1 percent and 27.2 percent by taking the geometric average,
which is 39.1 percent. Second, it uses years 1 and 2 as the base years when computing the
percentage change between years 1 and 2, years 2 and 3 as the base years when computing the
percentage change between years 2 and 3, and so on. The series of percentage changes com-
puted this way is taken to be the series of percentage changes in the GDP deflator, that is, a
series of inflation rates.
The Problems of Fixed Weights
To see why the BEA switched to the new procedure, let us consider a number of problems using
fixed-price weights to compute real GDP. First, 1987 price weights, the last price weights the BEA
used before it changed procedures, are not likely to be very accurate for, say, the 1950s. Many
4 The geometric average is computed as the square root of 124.8  104.3, which is 114.09.

CHAPTER 21
Measuring National Output and National Income 435
structural changes have taken place in the U.S. economy in the last 40 to 50 years, and it seems
unlikely that 1987 prices are good weights to use for the 1950s.
Another problem is that the use of fixed-price weights does not account for the responses in the
economy to supply shifts. Perhaps bad weather leads to a lower production of oranges in year 2. In
a simple supply-and-demand diagram for oranges, this corresponds to a shift of the supply curve to
the left, which leads to an increase in the price of oranges and a decrease in the quantity demanded.
As consumers move up the demand curve, they are substituting away from oranges. If technical
advances in year 2 result in cheaper ways of producing computers, the result is a shift of the com-
puter supply curve to the right, which leads to a decrease in the price of computers and an increase
in the quantity demanded. Consumers are substituting toward computers. (You should be able to
draw supply-and-demand diagrams for both cases.) Table 21.6 on p. 433 shows this tendency. The
quantity of good A rose between years 1 and 2 and the price decreased (the computer case), whereas
the quantity of good B fell and the price increased (the orange case).The computer supply curve has
been shifting to the right over time, due primarily to technical advances. The result has been large
decreases in the price of computers and large increases in the quantity demanded.
To see why these responses pose a problem for the use of fixed-price weights, consider the data
in Table 21.6. Because the price of good A was higher in year 1, the increase in production of good
A is weighted more if we use year 1 as the base year than if we used year 2 as the base year. Also,
because the price of good B was lower in year 1, the decrease in production of good B is weighted
less if we use year 1 as the base year. These effects make the overall change in real GDP larger if we
use year 1 price weights than if we use year 2 price weights. Using year 1 price weights ignores the
kinds of substitution responses discussed in the previous paragraph and leads to what many believe
are too-large estimates of real GDP changes. In the past, the BEA tended to move the base year for-
ward about every 5 years, resulting in the past estimates of real GDP growth being revised down-
ward. It is undesirable to have past growth estimates change simply because of the change to a new
base year. The new BEA procedure avoids many of these fixed-weight problems.
Similar problems arise when using fixed-quantity weights to compute price indexes. For
example, the fixed-weight procedure ignores the substitution away from goods whose prices are
increasing and toward goods whose prices are decreasing or increasing less rapidly. The proce-
dure tends to overestimate the increase in the overall price level. As discussed in the next chapter,
there are still a number of price indexes that are computed using fixed weights. The GDP deflator
differs because it does not use fixed weights. It is also a price index for all the goods and services
produced in the economy. Other price indexes cover fewer domestically produced goods and ser-
vices but also include some imported (foreign-produced) goods and services.
It should finally be stressed that there is no “right”way of computing real GDP. The economy
consists of many goods, each with its own price, and there is no exact way of adding together the
production of the different goods. We can say that the BEA’s new procedure for computing real
GDP avoids the problems associated with the use of fixed weights, and it seems to be an improve-
ment over the old procedure. We will see in the next chapter, however, that the consumer price
index (CPI)—a widely used price index—is still computed using fixed weights.
Limitations of the GDP Concept
We generally think of increases in GDP as good. Increasing GDP (or preventing its decrease) is
usually considered one of the chief goals of the government’s macroeconomic policy. Because
some serious problems arise when we try to use GDP as a measure of happiness or well-being, we
now point out some of the limitations of the GDP concept as a measure of welfare.
GDP and Social Welfare
If crime levels went down, society would be better off, but a decrease in crime is not an increase
in output and is not reflected in GDP. Neither is an increase in leisure time. Yet to the extent that
households want extra leisure time (instead of having it forced on them by a lack of jobs in the
economy), an increase in leisure is also an increase in social welfare. Furthermore, some
increases in social welfare are associated with a decrease in GDP. An increase in leisure during a

436
PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics 
time of full employment, for example, leads to a decrease in GDP because less time is spent on
producing output.
Most nonmarket and domestic activities, such as housework and child care, are not counted
in GDP even though they amount to real production. However, if I decide to send my children to
day care or hire someone to clean my house or drive my car for me, GDP increases. The salaries
of day care staff, cleaning people, and chauffeurs are counted in GDP, but the time I spend doing
the same things is not counted. A mere change of institutional arrangements, even though no
more output is being produced, can show up as a change in GDP.
Furthermore, GDP seldom reflects losses or social ills. GDP accounting rules do not adjust
for production that pollutes the environment. The more production there is, the larger the GDP,
regardless of how much pollution results in the process.
GDP also has nothing to say about the distribution of output among individuals in a society.
It does not distinguish, for example, between the case in which most output goes to a few people
and the case in which output is evenly divided among all people. We cannot use GDP to measure
the effects of redistributive policies (which take income from some people and give income to oth-
ers). Such policies have no direct impact on GDP. GDP is also neutral about the kinds of goods an
economy produces. Symphony performances, handguns, cigarettes, professional football games,
Bibles, soda pop, milk, economics textbooks, and comic books all get counted similarly.
The Underground Economy
Many transactions are missed in the calculation of GDP even though, in principle, they should be
counted. Most illegal transactions are missed unless they are “laundered”into legitimate business.
Income that is earned but not reported as income for tax purposes is usually missed, although
some adjustments are made in the GDP calculations to take misreported income into account.
The part of the economy that should be counted in GDP but is not is sometimes called the
underground economy.
Tax evasion is usually thought to be the major incentive for people to participate in the
underground economy. Studies estimate that the size of the U.S. underground economy, ranging
from 5 percent to 30 percent of GDP,5 is comparable to the size of the underground economy in
most European countries and probably much smaller than the size of the underground economy
in the Eastern European countries. Estimates of Italy’s underground economy range from 10 per-
cent to 35 percent of Italian GDP. At the lower end of the scale, estimates for Switzerland range
from 3 percent to 5 percent.
Why should we care about the underground economy? To the extent that GDP reflects only a
part of economic activity instead of a complete measure of what the economy produces, it is mis-
leading. Unemployment rates, for example, may be lower than officially measured if people work
in the underground economy without reporting this fact to the government. Also, if the size of
the underground economy varies among countries—as it does—we can be misled when we com-
pare GDP among countries. For example, Italy’s GDP would be much higher if we considered its
underground sector as part of the economy, while Switzerland’s GDP would change very little.
Gross National Income per Capita
Making comparisons across countries is difficult because such comparisons need to be made
in a single currency, generally U.S. dollars. Converting GNP numbers for Japan into dollars
requires converting from yen into dollars. Since exchange rates can change quite dramatically
in short periods of time, such conversions are tricky. Recently, the World Bank adopted a new
measuring system for international comparisons. The concept of gross national income (GNI)
is GNP converted into dollars using an average of currency exchange rates over several 
years adjusted for rates of inflation. Figure 21.1 lists the gross national income per capita
underground economy
The
part of the economy in which
transactions take place and in
which income is generated that
is unreported and therefore
not counted in GDP.

Economic Approach,” World Development 19(7), 1990, and “The Underground Economy in the United States,” Occasional Paper
No. 2, U.S. Department of Labor, September 1992.

1. One source of data on the key variables in the macroeconomy
is the national income and product accounts. These accounts
provide a conceptual framework that macroeconomists use to
think about how the pieces of the economy fit together.
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT p. 423
2. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the key concept in national
income accounting. GDP is the total market value of all final
goods and services produced within a given period by factors
of production located within a country. GDP excludes
intermediate goods. To include goods when they are pur-
chased as inputs and when they are sold as final products
would be double counting and would result in an overstate-
ment of the value of production.
3. GDP excludes all transactions in which money or goods
change hands but in which no new goods and services are
produced. GDP includes the income of foreigners working
in the United States and the profits that foreign companies
earn in the United States. GDP excludes the income of U.S.
citizens working abroad and profits earned by U.S. compa-
nies in foreign countries.
4. Gross national product (GNP) is the market value of all final
goods and services produced during a given period by fac-
tors of production owned by a country’s citizens.
(GNI divided by population) for various countries in 2008. Norway had the highest per capita
GNI followed by Denmark, Switzerland, and Sweden. Ethiopia was estimated to have per
capita GNI of only $280 in 2008. This compares to $87,340 for Norway.
Looking Ahead
This chapter has introduced many key variables in which macroeconomists are interested,
including GDP and its components. There is much more to be learned about the data that
macroeconomists use. In the next chapter, we will discuss the data on employment, unemploy-
ment, and the labor force. In Chapters 25 and 26, we will discuss the data on money and interest
rates. Finally, in Chapter 35, we will discuss in more detail the data on the relationship between
the United States and the rest of the world.

PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics 
CALCULATING GDP p. 425
5. The expenditure approach to GDP adds up the amount spent
on all final goods and services during a given period. The four
main categories of expenditures are personal consumption
expenditures (C), gross private domestic investment (I),
government consumption and gross investment (G), and net
exports (EX - IM). The sum of these categories equals GDP.
6. The three main components of personal consumption
expenditures (C) are durable goods, nondurable goods, and
services.
7. Gross private domestic investment (I) is the total investment
made by the private sector in a given period. There are
three kinds of investment: nonresidential investment, residential
investment, and changes in business inventories. Gross
investment does not take depreciation—the decrease in the
value of assets—into account. Net investment is equal to
gross investment minus depreciation.
8. Government consumption and gross investment (G) include
expenditures by state, federal, and local governments for
final goods and services. The value of net exports (EX - IM)
equals the differences between exports (sales to foreigners of
U.S.-produced goods and services) and imports (U.S. pur-
chases of goods and services from abroad).
9. Because every payment (expenditure) by a buyer is a receipt
(income) for the seller, GDP can be computed in terms of
who receives it as income—the income approach to calculat-
ing gross domestic product.
10. GNP minus depreciation is net national product (NNP).
National income is the total amount earned by the factors of
production in the economy. It is equal to NNP except for a
statistical discrepancy. Personal income is the total income of
households. Disposable personal income is what households
have to spend or save after paying their taxes. The personal
saving rate is the percentage of disposable personal income
saved instead of spent.
NOMINAL VERSUS REAL GDP p. 432
11. GDP measured in current dollars (the current prices that
one pays for goods) is nominal GDP. If we use nominal
GDP to measure growth, we can be misled into thinking
that production has grown when all that has happened is a
rise in the price level, or inflation. A better measure of pro-
duction is real GDP, which is nominal GDP adjusted for
price changes.
12. The GDP deflator is a measure of the overall price level.
LIMITATIONS OF THE GDP CONCEPT p. 435
13. We generally think of increases in GDP as good, but some
problems arise when we try to use GDP as a measure of
happiness or well-being. The peculiarities of GDP
accounting mean that institutional changes can change
the value of GDP even if real production has not changed.
GDP ignores most social ills, such as pollution.
Furthermore, GDP tells us nothing about what kinds of
goods are being produced or how income is distributed
across the population. GDP also ignores many transac-
tions of the underground economy.
14. The concept of gross national income (GNI) is GNP con-
verted into dollars using an average of currency exchange
rates over several years adjusted for rates of inflation.

2. How do we know that calculating GDP by the expenditure
approach yields the same answer as calculating GDP by the
income approach?
3. As the following table indicates, GNP and real GNP were almost
the same in 1972, but there was a $300 billion difference by
mid-1975. Explain why. Describe what the numbers here sug-
gest about conditions in the economy at the time. How do the
conditions compare with conditions today?
4. What are some of the problems in using fixed weights to com-
pute real GDP and the GDP price index? How does the BEA’s
approach attempt to solve these problems?
5. Explain what double counting is and discuss why GDP is not
equal to total sales.
6. The following table gives some figures from a forecast of real GDP
(in 2005 dollars) and population done in mid-2010. According to
the forecast, approximately how much real growth will there be
between 2010 and 2011? What is per capita real GDP projected to
be in 2010 and in 2011? Compute the forecast rate of change in
real GDP and per capita real GDP between 2010 and 2011.

7. Look at a recent edition of The Economist. Go to the section on
economic indicators. Go down the list of countries and make a
list of the ones with the fastest and slowest GDP growth. Look
also at the forecast rates of GDP growth. Go back to the table of
contents at the beginning of the journal to see if there are arti-
cles about any of these countries. Write a paragraph or two
describing the events or the economic conditions in one of the
countries. Explain why they are growing or not growing rapidly.
8. During 2002, real GDP in Japan rose about 1.3 percent. During
the same period, retail sales in Japan fell 1.8 percent in real
terms. What are some possible explanations for retail sales to
consumers falling when GDP rises? (Hint: Think of the compo-
sition of GDP using the expenditure approach.)
9. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 431] Which of the
following transactions would not be counted in GDP? Explain
your answers.
a. General Motors issues new shares of stock to finance the
construction of a plant.
b. General Motors builds a new plant.
c. Company A successfully launches a hostile takeover of com-
pany B, in which company A purchases all the assets of
company B.
d. Your grandmother wins $10 million in the lottery.
e. You buy a new copy of this textbook.
f. You buy a used copy of this textbook.
g. The government pays out Social Security benefits.
h. A public utility installs new antipollution equipment in its
smokestacks.
i.
Luigi’s Pizza buys 30 pounds of mozzarella cheese, holds it in
inventory for 1 month, and then uses it to make pizza
(which it sells).
j.
You spend the weekend cleaning your apartment.
k. A drug dealer sells $500 worth of illegal drugs.
10. If you buy a new car, the entire purchase is counted as consump-
tion in the year in which you make the transaction. Explain
briefly why this is in one sense an “error” in national income
accounting. (Hint: How is the purchase of a car different from
the purchase of a pizza?) How might you correct this error?
How is housing treated in the National Income and Product
Accounts? Specifically how does owner occupied housing enter
into the accounts? (Hint: Do some Web searching on “imputed
rent on owner occupied housing.”)
11. Explain why imports are subtracted in the expenditure
approach to calculating GDP.

12. GDP calculations do not directly include the economic costs of
environmental damage—for example, global warming and acid
rain. Do you think these costs should be included in GDP? Why
or why not? How could GDP be amended to include environ-
mental damage costs?
13. Beginning in 2005, the housing market, which had been
booming for years, turned. Housing construction dropped
sharply in 2006. Go to www.bea.gov. Look at the GDP release
and at past releases from 2002–2010. In real dollars, how
much private residential fixed investment (houses, apart-
ments, condominiums, and cooperatives) took place in each
quarter from 2002–2010? What portion of GDP did housing
construction represent? After 2006, residential fixed invest-
ment was declining sharply, yet GDP was growing until the
end of 2007. What categories of aggregate spending kept
things moving between 2006 and the end of 2007?
14. By mid-2009, many economists believed that the recession had
ended and the U.S. economy had entered an economic expan-
sion. Define recession and expansion. Go to www.bea.gov and
look at the growth of GDP during 2009. In addition, go to www.
bls.gov and look at payroll employment and the unemployment
rate. Had the recession ended and had the U.S. economy entered
an expansion? What do you see in the data? Can you tell by
reading newspapers or watching cable news whether the coun-
try had entered an expansion? Explain.
15. Jeannine, a successful real estate agent in San Francisco, occa-
sionally includes one of her home listings in the real estate sec-
tion on eBay. In December 2010, Jeannine listed a home built
in 1934 on eBay for $1.2 million, and she accepted an offer
from a buyer in Copenhagen, Denmark, for $1.15 million in
January 2011. What part, if any, of this transaction will be
included as a part of U.S. GDP in 2011?
16. Larson has started a home wine-making business and he buys
all his ingredients from his neighborhood farmers’ market and a
local bottle manufacturer. Last year he purchased $4,000 worth
of ingredients and bottles and produced 2,000 bottles of wine.
He sold all 2,000 bottles of wine to an upscale restaurant for $10
each. The restaurant sold all the wine to customers for $45 each.
For the total wine production, calculate the value added of
Larson and of the restaurant.
17. Artica is a nation with a simple economy that produces only
six goods: oranges, bicycles, magazines, paper, orange juice,
and hats. Assume that half of all the oranges are used to pro-
duce orange juice and one-third of all the paper is used to pro-
duce magazines.
a. Use the production and price information in the table to cal-
culate nominal GDP for 2011.
b. Use the production and price information in the table to cal-
culate real GDP for 2009, 2010, and 2011 using 2009 as the
base year. What is the growth rate of real GDP from 2009 to
2010 and from 2010 to 2011?
c. Use the production and price information in the table to cal-
culate real GDP for 2009, 2010, and 2011 using 2010 as the
base year. What is the growth rate of real GDP from 2009 to
2010 and from 2010 to 2011?
19. Evaluate the following statement: Even if the prices of a large
number of goods and services in the economy increase dramati-
cally, the real GDP for the economy can still fall.
18. The following table contains nominal and real GDP data, in bil-
lions of dollars, from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis for
2008 and 2009. The data is listed per quarter, and the real GDP
data was calculated using 2005 as the base year. Fill in the columns
for the GDP deflator and for the percent increase in price level.

Unemployment,
Inflation, and 
Long-Run Growth
Each month the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) announces
the value of the unemployment rate
for the previous month. For exam-
ple, on July 2, 2010, it announced
that the unemployment rate for
June 2010 was 9.5 percent. The
unemployment rate is a key mea-
sure of how the economy is doing.
This announcement is widely
watched, and if the announced
unemployment rate is different
from what the financial markets
expect, there can be large move-
ments in those markets. It is thus important to know how the BLS computes the unemployment
rate. The first part of this chapter describes how the unemployment rate is computed and dis-
cusses its various components.
Inflation is another key macroeconomic variable. The previous chapter discussed how the
GDP deflator, the price deflator for the entire economy, is computed. The percentage change in
the GDP deflator is a measure of inflation. There are, however, other measures of inflation, each
pertaining to some part of the economy. The most widely followed price index is the consumer
price index (CPI), and its measurement is discussed next in this chapter. The CPI is also
announced monthly by the BLS, and this announcement is widely followed by the financial mar-
kets as well. For example, on June 17, 2010, the BLS announced that the percentage change in the
CPI for May 2010 was –1.9 percent at an annual rate. After discussing the measurement of the
CPI, this chapter discusses various costs of inflation.
The last topic considered in this chapter is long-run growth. Although much of macro-
economics is concerned with explaining business cycles, long-run growth is also a major concern.
The average yearly growth rate of U.S. real GDP depicted in Figure 20.2 on p. 411 is 3.3 percent.
So while there were many ups and downs during the 110 years depicted in Figure 20.2, on aver-
age, the economy was growing at a 3.3 percent rate. In the last part of this chapter, we discuss the
sources of this growth.
Keep in mind that this chapter is still descriptive. We begin our analysis of how the economy
works in the next chapter.
Unemployment
We begin our discussion of unemployment with its measurement.
Measuring Unemployment
The unemployment data released each month by the BLS are based on a survey of households.
Each month the BLS draws a sample of 65,000 households and completes interviews with all
but about 2,500 of them. Each interviewed household answers questions concerning the work

442
PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics
activity of household members 16 years of age or older during the calendar week that con-
tains the twelfth of the month. (The survey is conducted in the week that contains the twelfth
of the month.)
If a household member 16 years of age or older worked 1 hour or more as a paid employee,
either for someone else or in his or her own business or farm, the person is classified as employed.
A household member is also considered employed if he or she worked 15 hours or more without
pay in a family enterprise. Finally, a household member is counted as employed if the person held
a job from which he or she was temporarily absent due to illness, bad weather, vacation, labor-
management disputes, or personal reasons, regardless of whether he or she was paid.
Those who are not employed fall into one of two categories: (1) unemployed or (2) not in
the labor force. To be considered unemployed, a person must be 16 years old or older, available
for work, and have made specific efforts to find work during the previous 4 weeks. A person not
looking for work because he or she does not want a job or has given up looking is classified as not
in the labor force. People not in the labor force include full-time students, retirees, individuals in
institutions, those staying home to take care of children, and discouraged job seekers.
The total labor force in the economy is the number of people employed plus the number 
of unemployed:
employed
Any person
16 years old or older (1) who
works for pay, either for
someone else or in his or her
own business for 1 or more
hours per week, (2) who works
without pay for 15 or more
hours per week in a family
enterprise, or (3) who has a
job but has been temporarily
absent with or without pay.
unemployed
A person
16 years old or older who is
not working, is available for
work, and has made specific
efforts to find work during the
previous 4 weeks.
not in the labor force
A
person who is not looking for
work because he or she does
not want a job or has given 
up looking.
labor force
The number of
people employed plus the
number of unemployed.
labor force = employed + unemployed
The total population 16 years of age or older is equal to the number of people in the labor force
plus the number not in the labor force:
population = labor force + not in labor force
With these numbers, several ratios can be calculated. The unemployment rate is the ratio of
the number of people unemployed to the total number of people in the labor force:

ratio of the number of people
unemployed to the total
number of people in the

In June 2010, the labor force contained 153.741 million people, 139.119 million of whom were
employed and 14.623 million of whom were unemployed and looking for work. The unemploy-
ment rate was 9.5 percent:

In June 2010, the population of 16 years old or over was 237.690 million. So the labor force par-
ticipation rate was .65 (= 153.741/237.690).
Table 22.1 shows values of these variables for selected years since 1950. Although the
unemployment rate has gone up and down over this period, the labor force participation
rate grew steadily between 1950 and 2000. Much of this increase was due to the growth in the
participation rate of women between the ages of 25 and 54. Column 3 in Table 22.1 shows
how many new workers the U.S. economy has absorbed in recent years. The number of
employed workers increased by 40.4 million between 1950 and 1980 and by 40.6 million
between 1980 and 2009.

Components of the Unemployment Rate
The unemployment rate by itself conveys some but not all information about the unemployment
picture. To get a better picture, it is useful to look at unemployment rates across groups of people,
regions, and industries.
Unemployment Rates for Different Demographic Groups
There are large dif-
ferences in rates of unemployment across demographic groups. Table 22.2 shows the unemploy-
ment rate for November 1982—the worst month of the recession in 1982—and for June 2010—also
a month with high overall unemployment—broken down by race, sex, and age. In June 2010,
when the overall unemployment rate hit 9.5 percent, the rate for whites was 8.6 percent while the
rate for African Americans was almost twice that—15.4 percent.
During the recessions in both 1982 and 2010, men fared worse than women. For African
Americans, 19.3 percent of men 20 years and over and 16.5 percent of women 20 years and over
were unemployed in 1982, while the comparable numbers in 2010 are 17.4 for African American
men and 11.8 for African American women. Teenagers between 16 and 19 years of age fared worst.
African Americans between 16 and 19 experienced an unemployment rate of 39.9 percent in June
2010. For whites between 16 and 19, the unemployment rate was 23.2 percent. The pattern was
similar in November 1982.
Unemployment Rates in States and Regions
Unemployment rates also vary by geo-
graphic location. For a variety of reasons, not all states and regions have the same level of unem-
ployment. States and regions have different combinations of industries, which do not all grow
and decline at the same time and at the same rate. Also, the labor force is not completely
mobile—workers often cannot or do not want to pack up and move to take advantage of job
opportunities in other parts of the country.

Michigan is another interesting state. As you probably know, Michigan is highly dependent
on the automotive industry. Michigan has suffered unemployment rates above the national aver-
age for decades as the American automobile industry has lost share to foreign competition, and
the state economy has been relatively slow to attract new industries. It should not surprise you
that Michigan has one of the highest unemployment rates in 2010, given the state of the U.S. auto
industry in the recent period.
Finally, consider Texas. Texas produces about 20 percent of the oil in the United States. (Alaska
is another large oil producer.) For most of the last 35 years oil has done well, and for most of this
period Texas has had relatively low unemployment rates. In Table 22.3, only in 2003 was Texas’
unemployment rate greater than the national average.
Discouraged-Worker Effects
Many people believe that the unemployment rate under-
estimates the fraction of people who are involuntarily out of work. People who stop looking for
work are classified as having dropped out of the labor force instead of being unemployed. During
recessions, people may become discouraged about finding a job and stop looking. This lowers the
unemployment rate as calculated by the BLS because those no longer looking for work are no
longer counted as unemployed.
To demonstrate how this discouraged-worker effect lowers the unemployment rate, suppose
there are 10 million unemployed out of a labor force of 100 million. This means an unemployment
rate of 10/100 = .10, or 10 percent. If 1 million of these 10 million unemployed people stopped
looking for work and dropped out of the labor force, 9 million would be unemployed out of a
labor force of 99 million. The unemployment rate would then drop to 9/99 = .091, or 9.1 percent.
The BLS survey provides some evidence on the size of the discouraged-worker effect.
Respondents who indicate that they have stopped searching for work are asked why they stopped.
If the respondent cites inability to find employment as the sole reason for not searching, that per-
son might be classified as a discouraged worker.
The number of discouraged workers seems to hover around 1 percent of the size of the labor
force in normal times. During the 1980–1982 recession, the number of discouraged workers
increased steadily to a peak of 1.5 percent. In June 2010 there were estimated to be 1.2 million dis-
couraged workers, about 0.8 percent of the size of the labor force. Some economists argue that
As Table 22.3 shows, in the last 35 years remarkable changes have occurred in the relative
prosperity of regions. In the 1970s Massachusetts was still quite dependent on its industrial
base. As textile mills, leather goods plants, and furniture factories closed in the face of competi-
tion both from abroad and from lower wage southern states, Massachusetts experienced rela-
tively high unemployment. By the 1980s, the state had moved into more high-technology areas
with the birth of firms like Wang Laboratories and Digital Equipment and later by biotech firms
like Genentech; state unemployment rates also were relatively low. In 2010 Massachusetts was
close to the national average for unemployment.
discouraged-worker effect
The decline in the measured
unemployment rate that results
when people who want to work
but cannot find jobs grow
discouraged and stop looking,
thus dropping out of the ranks
of the unemployed and the
labor force.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
A Quiet Revolution: Women Join the Labor Force
Table 22.1 shows that the labor force participation rate in the
United States increased from 59.2 percent in 1950 to 65.4 percent in
2009. Much of this increase was due to the increased participation
of women in the labor force. In 1955, the labor force participation
rate of women was 36 percent. For married women, the rate was
even lower at 29 percent. By the 1990s, these numbers shifted con-
siderably. In 1996, the labor force participation rate was 60 percent
for all women and 62 percent for married women. The reasons for
these changes are complex. Certainly, in the 1960s, there was a
change in society’s attitude toward women and paid work. In addi-
tion, the baby boom became the baby bust as greater availability of
birth control led to fewer births.
By comparison, the participation rate for men declined over this
period—from 85 percent in 1955 to 75 percent in 1996. Why the
labor force participation rate for men fell is less clear than why the
women’s rate rose. No doubt, some men dropped out to assume
more traditional women’s roles, such as child care. Whatever the
causes, the economy grew in a way that absorbed virtually all the new
entrants during the period in question.
As women began joining the labor force in greater numbers in
the 1970s and 1980s, their wages relative to men’s wages actually
fell. Most economists attribute this decline to the fact that less expe-
rienced women were entering the labor force, pointing out the
importance of correcting for factors such as experience and educa-
tion when we analyze labor markets.
At least some of the women entering the labor force at this time
hired housecleaners and child care workers to perform tasks they
had once done themselves. As we learned in Chapter 21, the salaries
of daycare staff and cleaning people are counted in GDP, while the
value of these tasks when done by a husband or wife in a household
is not part of GDP.

tory of American women, read the book Understanding the Gender
Gap: An Economic History of American Women by Harvard
University economist Claudia Goldin.
CHAPTER 22
Unemployment, Inflation, and Long-Run Growth 445
adding the number of discouraged workers to the number who are now classified as unemployed
gives a better picture of the unemployment situation.
The Duration of Unemployment
The unemployment rate measures unemployment
at a given point in time. It tells us nothing about how long the average unemployed worker is out
of work. With a labor force of 1,000 people and an annual unemployment rate of 10 percent, we
know that at any moment 100 people are unemployed. But a very different picture emerges if it
turns out that the same 100 people are unemployed all year, as opposed to a situation in which
each of the 1,000 people has a brief spell of unemployment of a few weeks during the year. The
duration statistics give us information on this feature of unemployment. Table 22.4 shows that

Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics

used to denote short-run
job/skill-matching problems.
during recessionary periods, the average duration of unemployment rises. Between 1979 and
1983, the average duration of unemployment rose from 10.8 weeks to 20.0 weeks. The slow
growth following the 1990–1991 recession resulted in an increase in duration of unemployment
to 17.7 weeks in 1992 and to 18.8 weeks in 1994. In 2000, average duration was down to 12.6 weeks,
which then rose to 19.6 weeks in 2004. Between 2007 and 2009 average duration rose sharply
from 16.8 weeks to 24.4 weeks.
The Costs of Unemployment
In the Employment Act of 1946, Congress declared that it was the
continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government to use all practicable
means...to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.
In 1978, Congress passed the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act, commonly referred to
as the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, which formally established a specific unemployment rate target of
4 percent. Why should full employment be a policy objective of the federal government? What
costs does unemployment impose on society?
Some Unemployment Is Inevitable
Before we discuss the costs of unemployment, we
must realize that some unemployment is simply part of the natural workings of the labor market.
Remember, to be classified as unemployed, a person must be looking for a job. Every year thou-
sands of people enter the labor force for the first time. Some have dropped out of high school,
some are high school or college graduates, and still others are finishing graduate programs. At the
same time, new firms are starting up and others are expanding and creating new jobs while other
firms are contracting or going out of business.
At any moment, there is a set of job seekers and a set of jobs that must be matched with one
another. It is important that the right people end up in the right jobs. The right job for a person
will depend on that person’s skills, preferences concerning work environment (large firm or small,
formal or informal), location of the individual’s home, and willingness to commute. At the same
time, firms want workers who can meet the requirements of the job and grow with the company.
To make a good match, workers must acquire information on job availability, wage rates,
location, and work environment. Firms must acquire information on worker availability and
skills. Information gathering consumes time and resources. The search may involve travel, inter-
views, preparation of a résumé, telephone calls, and hours going through the newspaper. To the
extent that these efforts lead to a better match of workers and jobs, they are well spent. As long as
the gains to firms and workers exceed the costs of search, the result is efficient.
When we consider the various costs of unemployment, it is useful to categorize unemploy-
ment into three types:
 Frictional unemployment
 Structural unemployment
 Cyclical unemployment
Frictional, Structural, and Cyclical Unemployment
When the BLS does its sur-
vey about work activity for the week containing the twelfth of each month, it interviews many
people who are involved in the normal search for work. Some are either entering the labor
force or switching jobs. This unemployment is both natural and beneficial for the economy.
The portion of unemployment due to the normal turnover in the labor market is called
frictional unemployment. The frictional unemployment rate can never be zero. It may, how-
ever, change over time. As jobs become more differentiated and the number of required skills
increases, matching skills and jobs becomes more complex and the frictional unemployment
rate may rise.
The concept of frictional unemployment is somewhat vague because it is hard to know what
“the normal turnover in the labor market”means. The industrial structure of the U.S. economy is
continually changing. Manufacturing, for instance, has yielded part of its share of total employ-
ment to services and to finance, insurance, and real estate. Within the manufacturing sector, the
steel and textile industries have contracted sharply, while high-technology sectors such as electronic

Unemployment, Inflation, and Long-Run Growth 447
structural unemployment
The portion of unemployment
that is due to changes in the
structure of the economy that
result in a significant loss of
jobs in certain industries.
components have expanded. Although the unemployment that arises from such structural shifts
could be classified as frictional, it is usually called structural unemployment. The term frictional
unemployment is used to denote short-run job/skill-matching problems, problems that last a few
weeks. Structural unemployment denotes longer-run adjustment problems—those that tend to
last for years. Although structural unemployment is expected in a dynamic economy, it is painful
to the workers who experience it. In some ways, those who lose their jobs because their skills are
obsolete experience the greatest pain. The fact that structural unemployment is natural and
inevitable does not mean that it costs society nothing.
Economists sometimes use the term natural rate of unemployment to refer to the unem-
ployment rate that occurs in a normal functioning economy. This concept is also vague because it
is hard to know what a “normal functioning economy” means. It is probably best to think of the
natural rate of unemployment as the sum of the frictional rate and the structural rate. Estimates
of the natural rate vary from 4 percent to 6 percent.
There are times when the actual unemployment rate appears to be above the natural rate.
Between 2007 and 2009 the actual unemployment rate rose from 4.6 percent to 9.3 percent, and
it seems unlikely that all of this rise was simply due to a rise in frictional and structural
unemployment. Any unemployment that is above frictional plus structural is called cyclical
unemployment. It seems likely that much of the unemployment in 2009, during the 2008–2009
recession, was cyclical unemployment.
Social Consequences
The costs of unemployment are neither evenly distributed across the
population nor easily quantified. The social consequences of the Depression of the 1930s are per-
haps the hardest to comprehend. Few emerged from this period unscathed.At the bottom were the
poor and the fully unemployed, about 25 percent of the labor force. Even those who kept their jobs
found themselves working part-time. Many people lost all or part of their savings as the stock mar-
ket crashed and thousands of banks failed.
Congressional committees heard story after story. In Cincinnati, where the labor force
totaled about 200,000, about 48,000 were wholly unemployed, 40,000 more were on short time,
and relief payments to the needy averaged $7 to $8 per week:
Relief is given to a family one week and then they are pushed off for a week in the hope
that somehow or other the breadwinner may find some kind of work....We are paying
no rent at all. That, of course, is a very difficult problem because we are continually hav-
ing evictions, and social workers...are hard put to find places for people whose furniture
has been put out on the street.1
From Birmingham, Alabama, in 1932:
...we have about 108,000 wage and salary workers in my district. Of that number, it is my
belief that not exceeding 8000 have their normal incomes.At least 25,000 men are altogether
without work. Some of them have not had a stroke of work for more than 12 months.
Perhaps 60,000 or 70,000 are working from one to five days a week, and practically all
have had serious cuts in wages and many of them do not average over $1.50 per day.2
Inflation
In a market economy like the U.S. economy, prices of individual goods continually change as sup-
ply and demand shift. Indeed, a major concern of microeconomics is understanding the way in
which relative prices change—why, for example, have computers become less expensive over time
and dental services more expensive? In macroeconomics, we are concerned not with relative price
changes, but with changes in the overall price level of goods and services. Inflation is defined as an
increase in the overall price level, while deflation is a decrease in the overall price level.

The fact that all prices for the multitude of goods and services in our economy do not rise and
fall together at the same rate makes measurement of inflation difficult. We have already explored
measurement issues in Chapter 21 in defining the GDP deflator, which measures the price level for
all goods and services in an economy. We turn now to look at a second, commonly used measure of
the price level, the consumer price index.
The Consumer Price Index
The consumer price index (CPI) is the most widely followed price index. Unlike the GDP defla-
tor, it is a fixed-weight index. It was first constructed during World War I as a basis for adjusting
shipbuilders’ wages, which the government controlled during the war. Currently, the CPI is com-
puted by the BLS each month using a bundle of goods meant to represent the “market basket”
purchased monthly by the typical urban consumer. The quantities of each good in the bundle
that are used for the weights are based on extensive surveys of consumers. In fact, the BLS collects
prices each month for about 71,000 goods and services from about 22,000 outlets in 44 geo-
graphic areas. For example, the cost of housing is included in the data collection by surveying
about 5,000 renters and 1,000 homeowners each month. Figure 22.1 shows the CPI market bas-
ket for December 2007.
Table 22.5 shows values of the CPI since 1950. The base period for this index is 1982–1984,
which means that the index is constructed to have a value of 100.0 when averaged across these
three years. The percentage change for a given year in the table is a measure of inflation in that
year. For example, from 1970 to 1971, the CPI increased from 38.8 to 40.5, a percentage change of
4.9 percent. [The percentage change is (40.5 – 38.8)/38.8 times 100.] The table shows the high
inflation rates in the 1970s and early 1980s and the fairly low inflation rates since 1992.
Since the CPI is a fixed-weight price index (with the current base period 1982–1984), it suf-
fers from the substitution problem discussed in the last chapter. With fixed weights, it does not
account for consumers’ substitution away from high-priced goods. The CPI thus has a tendency
to overestimate the rate of inflation. This problem has important policy implications because
government transfers such as Social Security payments are tied to the CPI. If inflation as mea-
sured by percentage changes in the CPI is biased upward, Social Security payments will grow
more rapidly than they would with a better measure: The government is spending more than it
otherwise would.

CHAPTER 22
Unemployment, Inflation, and Long-Run Growth 449
In response to the fixed-weight problem, in August 2002, the BLS began publishing a version
of the CPI called the Chained Consumer Price Index, which uses changing weights. Although this
version is not yet the main version, it may be that within a few years the BLS completely moves
away from the fixed-weight version of the CPI. Remember, however, that even if this happens, the
CPI will still differ in important ways from the GDP deflator, discussed in the last chapter. The
CPI covers only consumer goods and services—those listed in Figure 22.1—whereas the GDP
deflator covers all goods and services produced in the economy. Also, the CPI includes prices of
imported goods, which the GDP deflator does not.
Other popular price indexes are producer price indexes (PPIs), once called wholesale price
indexes. These are indexes of prices that producers receive for products at all stages in the produc-
tion process, not just the final stage. The indexes are calculated separately for various stages in the
production process. The three main categories are finished goods, intermediate materials, and
crude materials, although there are subcategories within each of these categories.
One advantage of some of the PPIs is that they detect price increases early in the production
process. Because their movements sometimes foreshadow future changes in consumer prices,
they are considered to be leading indicators of future consumer prices.

The Costs of Inflation
If you asked most people why inflation is bad,they would tell you that it lowers the overall standard of
living by making goods and services more expensive. That is, it cuts into people’s purchasing power.
People are fond of recalling the days when a bottle of Coca-Cola cost a dime and a hamburger cost a
quarter. Just think what we could buy today if prices had not changed. What people usually do not

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
The Politics of Cost-of-Living Adjustments
In the last few years many state governments in the United States
have begun to see the costs associated with retiring state workers
escalate as the number of retirees has grown. For many of these
public-sector retirees, pensions have been tied to the cost of living.
In most years the CPI has gone up and pensions with it. But as you
saw in Table 22.5, in 2009 the CPI fell. The article below describes
the situation for state retirees in Maryland, in 2010, following the
CPI decline when no pension increases were forthcoming. As one
retiree points out, even if the overall rate of inflation is negative or
low, prices in the market basket a typical retiree purchases may
have gone up. It is difficult to design the optimal policy under
these conditions.
No Cost-of-Living Increase for State
Retirees in July
The Baltimore Sun
More than 115,000 retirees and beneficiaries collecting state
pensions won’t see an increase in their checks next month—a
first since annual cost-of-living adjustments were put in place 
in 1971.
Retirement payments were actually set to drop slightly
in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index, a common
measure of inflation that fell in 2009 after rising for more
than half a century. Instead, the General Assembly decided
to hold the benefits steady and plans to subtract from any
increase next year the amount added this year to make up
for deflation.
Virginia Crespo, 63, understands the reasoning. Deflation
also kept her Social Security payment from rising in January
as it normally would. The trouble is, her cost of living has
gone up, not down, she says.
Health care is driving her expenses up, as is the case for
many retirees. The cost of her health insurance premium
increased by $44 a month in December; at the same time,
her co-pay for three months of blood-pressure medicine
jumped from $10 to $50.
“There’s going to be nothing to balance out that
amount in July,” said Crespo, a Millersville resident who
retired eight years ago from the Anne Arundel County pub-
lic school system. Teachers’ pensions are handled by the
state. “With less money in the check, you have to be much
more cautious.”

Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics
think about is what their incomes were in the“good old days.”The fact that the cost of a Coke has
increased from 10 cents to a dollar does not mean anything in real terms if people who once
earned $5,000 now earn $50,000. During inflations, most prices—including input prices like
wages—tend to rise together, and input prices determine both the incomes of workers and the
incomes of owners of capital and land. So inflation by itself does not necessarily reduce ones
purchasing power.
Inflation May Change the Distribution of Income
Whether you gain or lose dur-
ing a period of inflation depends on whether your income rises faster or slower than the prices of
the things you buy. The group most often mentioned when the impact of inflation is discussed is
people living on fixed incomes. If your income is fixed and prices rise, your ability to purchase
goods and services falls proportionately.
Although the elderly are often thought of as living on fixed incomes, many pension plans
pay benefits that are indexed to inflation, as we describe in the Economics in Practice on this page.
The benefits these plans provide automatically increase when the general price level rises. If
prices rise 10 percent, benefits also rise 10 percent. The biggest source of income for the elderly
is Social Security. These benefits are fully indexed; when prices rise—that is, when the CPI
rises—by 5 percent, Social Security benefits also increase by 5 percent.

CHAPTER 22
Unemployment, Inflation, and Long-Run Growth 451
real interest rate
The
difference between the interest
rate on a loan and the
inflation rate.
Wages are also sometimes indexed to inflation through cost of living adjustments (COLAs)
written into labor contracts. These contracts usually stipulate that future wage increases will be
larger the larger is the rate of inflation. If wages are fully indexed, workers do not suffer a fall in
real income when inflation rises, although wages are not always fully indexed.
One way of thinking about the effects of inflation on the distribution of income is to distin-
guish between anticipated and unanticipated inflation. If inflation is anticipated and contracts are
made and agreements written with the anticipated value of inflation in mind, there need not be
any effects of inflation on income distribution. Consider an individual who is thinking about
retiring and has a pension that is not indexed to the CPI. If she knew what inflation was going to
be for the next 20 or 30 years of her retirement, there would be no problem. She would just wait
to retire until she had enough money to pay for her anticipated growing expenses. The problem
occurs if after she has retired inflation is higher than she expected. At that point, she may face the
prospect of having to return to work. Similarly, if I as a landlord expect inflation to be 2 percent
per year over the next 3 years and offer my tenants a 3-year lease with a 2 percent rent increase
each year, I will be in bad shape if inflation turns out to be 10 percent per year and causes all my
costs to rise by 10 percent per year.
For another example, consider debtors versus creditors. It is commonly believed that debtors
benefit at the expense of creditors during an inflation because with inflation they pay back less in
the future in real terms than they borrowed. But this is not the case if the inflation is anticipated
and the loan contract is written with this in mind.
Suppose that you want to borrow $100 from me to be paid back in a year and that we
both agree that if there is no inflation the appropriate interest rate is 5 percent. Suppose also
that we both anticipate that the inflation rate will be 10 percent. In this case we will agree on
a 15 percent interest rate—you will pay me back $115 at the end of the year. By charging you
15 percent I have taken into account the fact that you will be paying me back with dollars
worth 10 percent less in real terms than when you borrowed them. I am then not hurt by
inflation and you are not helped if the actual inflation rate turns out to equal our anticipated
rate. I am earning a 5 percent real interest rate—the difference between the interest rate on a
loan and the inflation rate.
Unanticipated inflation, on the other hand, is a different story. If the actual inflation rate
during the year turns out to be 20 percent, I as a creditor will be hurt. I charged you 15 percent
interest, expecting to get a 5 percent real rate of return, when I needed to charge you 25 percent to
get the same 5 percent real rate of return. Because inflation was higher than anticipated, I got a
negative real return of 5 percent. Inflation that is higher than anticipated benefits debtors; infla-
tion that is lower than anticipated benefits creditors.
To summarize, the effects of anticipated inflation on the distribution of income are likely to
be fairly small, since people and institutions will adjust to the anticipated inflation.
Unanticipated inflation, on the other hand, may have large effects, depending, among other
things, on how much indexing to inflation there is. If many contracts are not indexed and are
based on anticipated inflation rates that turn out to be wrong, there can be big winners and
losers. In general, there is more uncertainty and risk when inflation is unanticipated. This
uncertainty may prevent people from signing long-run contracts that would otherwise be bene-
ficial for both parties.
Administrative Costs and Inefficiencies
There may be costs associated even with
anticipated inflation. One is the administrative cost associated with simply keeping up. During
the rapid inflation in Israel in the early 1980s, a telephone hotline was set up to give the hourly
price index. Store owners had to recalculate and repost prices frequently, and this took time that
could have been used more efficiently. In Zimbabwe, where the inflation rate in June 2008 was
estimated by some to be over 1 million percent at an annual rate, the government was forced to
print ever-increasing denominations of money.
More frequent banking transactions may also be required when anticipated inflation is high.
For example, interest rates tend to rise with anticipated inflation. When interest rates are high, the
opportunity costs of holding cash outside of banks is high. People therefore hold less cash and need
to stop at the bank more often. (We discuss this effect in more detail in the next part of this book.)

PART IV
Concepts and Problems in Macroeconomics
Public Enemy Number One?
Economists have debated the seriousness of the costs
of inflation for decades. Some, among them Alan Blinder, say, “Inflation, like every teenager,
is grossly misunderstood, and this gross misunderstanding blows the political importance of
inflation out of all proportion to its economic importance.”3 Others such as Phillip Cagan
and Robert Lipsey argue, “It was once thought that the economy would in time make all 
the necessary adjustments [to inflation], but many of them are proving to be very difficult....
For financial institutions and markets, the effects of inflation have been extremely 
unsettling.”4
No matter what the real economic cost of inflation, people do not like it. It makes us uneasy
and unhappy. In 1974, President Ford verbalized some of this discomfort when he said, “Our
inflation, our public enemy number one, will unless whipped destroy our country, our homes,
our liberties, our property, and finally our national pride, as surely as any well-armed wartime
enemy.” 5 In this belief, our elected leaders have vigorously pursued policies designed to stop
inflation. In 2010, after many years of low inflation, some observers began to worry about pos-
sible future increases in inflation.
Long-Run Growth
In discussing long-run growth, it will be useful to begin with a few definitions. Output
growth is the growth rate of the output of the entire economy. Per-capita output growth
is the growth rate of output per person in the economy. If the population of a country is
growing at the same rate as output, then per-capita output is not growing: Output growth is
simply keeping up with population growth. Not everyone in a country works, and so output
per worker is not the same as output per person. Output per worker is larger than output per
person, and it is called productivity. Productivity growth is thus the growth rate of output 
per worker.
One measure of the economic welfare of a country is its per-capita output. Per-capita out-
put can increase because productivity increases, as each worker now produces more than he or
she did previously, or because there are more workers relative to nonworkers in the population.
In the United States, both forces have been at work in increasing per-capita output.
Output and Productivity Growth
We have pointed out that aggregate output in the United States has grown at an annual rate of
3.3 percent since 1900. Some years are better than this and some years worse, but, on average, the
growth rate has been 3.3 percent.An area of economics called growth theory is concerned with the
question of what determines this rate. Why 3.3 percent and not 2 percent or 4 percent? We take
up this question in Chapter 32, but a few points are useful to make now.
In a simplified economy, machines (capital) and workers (labor) are needed to produce out-
put. Suppose that an economy consists of six machines and 60 workers, with 10 workers working
on each machine, and that the length of the workweek is 40 hours, with this workweek resulting
in 50 units of output per month per machine. Total output (GDP) for the month is thus 300 units
(6 machines times 50 units per machine) in this simple economy.
How can output increase in this economy? There are a number of ways. One way is to add
more workers. If, for example, 12 workers are added, 2 extra per machine, more output can be
produced per machine per hour worked because there are more workers helping out on each
machine. Another way is to add more machines. For example, if 4 machines are added, the

Productivity grew much faster in the 1950s and 1960s than since.
60 workers have a total of 10 machines to work with instead of 6 and more output can be pro-
duced per worker per hour worked. A third way is to increase the length of the workweek (for
example, from 40 hours to 45 hours). With workers and machines working more hours, more
output can be produced. Output can thus increase if labor or capital increases or if the amount of
time that labor and capital are working per week increases.
Another way for output to increase in our economy is for the quality of the workers to
increase. If, for example, the education of the workers increases, this may add to their skills
and thus increase their ability to work on the machines. Output per machine might then rise
from 50 units per month to some larger number per month. Also, if workers become more
physically fit by exercising more and eating less fat and more whole grains and fresh fruits
and vegetables, their greater fitness may increase their output on the machines. People are
sometimes said to be adding to their human capital when they increase their mental or phys-
ical skills.
The quality of the machines may also increase. In particular, new machines that replace old
machines may allow more output to be produced per hour with the same number of workers. In
our example, it may be that 55 instead of 50 units of output can be produced per month per new
machine with 10 workers per machine and a 40-hour workweek. An obvious example is the
replacement of an old computer with a new, faster one that allows more to be done per minute of
work on the computer.
To summarize, output can increase when there are more workers, more skills per worker,
more machines, better machines, or a longer workweek.
Output per worker hour is called labor productivity or sometimes just productivity. Output per
worker hour is plotted in Figure 22.2 for the 1952 I–2010 I period. Two features are immediately
clear from the figure. First, there is an upward trend. Second, there are fairly sizable short-run fluc-
tuations around the trend. We will see in Chapter 31 why there are short-run fluctuations. This has
to do with the possibility that the employed workforce is not always fully utilized. For now, however,
the main interest is the long-run trend.
To smooth out the short-run fluctuations in Figure 22.2, we have added straight-line seg-
ments to the figure, where the segments roughly go through the high values. The slope of
each line segment is the growth rate of productivity along the segment. The growth rates are
listed in the figure. The different productivity growth rates in the figure tell an interesting
story. From the 1950s through the mid-1960s, the growth rate was 3.1 percent. The rate then

fell to 2.5 percent in the last half of the 1960s and early 1970s. Between the early 1970s and
the early 1990s, the growth rate was much lower at 1.4 percent. Since the early 1990s, it has
been 2.0 percent.
Why are the growth rates positive in Figure 22.2? Why has the amount of output that a
worker can produce per hour risen in the last half century? Part of the answer is that the amount
of capital per worker has increased. In Figure 22.3 capital per worker is plotted for the same 1952
I–2010 I period. It is clear from the figure that the amount of capital per worker has generally
been rising. Therefore, with more capital per worker, more output can be produced per worker.
The other part of the answer is that the quality of labor and capital has been increasing. Both the
average skill of workers and the average quality of capital have been increasing. This means that
more output can be produced per worker for a given quantity of capital because both workers
and capital are getting better.
A harder question to answer concerning Figure 22.2 is why the growth rate of produc-
tivity was much higher in the 1950s and 1960s than it has been since the early 1970s. Again,
part of the answer is that the amount of capital per worker rose more rapidly in the 1950s
and 1960s than it has since then. This can be seen in Figure 22.3. The other part of the
answer is, of course, that the quality of labor and capital must have increased more in the
1950s and 1960s than later, although this, to some extent, begs the question. The key ques-
tion is why the quality of labor and capital has grown more slowly since the early 1970s. We
take up this question in Chapter 32, where we will see that there seems to be no one
obvious answer. An interesting question for the future is whether the continued growth of
the Internet will lead to a much larger productivity growth rate, perhaps as large as
the growth rate in the 1950s and 1960s. In the present context, you can think about the
growth of the Internet as an increase in physical capital (wires, servers, switchers, and so
on) and an increase in the quality of capital (an increase in what can be done per minute
using the Internet). Time will tell whether the Internet will lead to a “new age” of produc-
tivity growth.
Looking Ahead
This ends our introduction to the basic concepts and problems of macroeconomics. The first
chapter of this part introduced the field; the second chapter discussed the measurement 
of national product and national income; and this chapter discussed unemployment, infla-
tion, and long-run growth. We are now ready to begin the analysis of how the macroecon-
omy works.

Unemployment, Inflation, and Long-Run Growth 455
S U M M A R Y
UNEMPLOYMENT p. 441
1. The unemployment rate is the ratio of the number of
unemployed people to the number of people in the labor
force. To be considered unemployed and in the labor force, a
person must be looking for work.
2. Big differences in rates of unemployment exist across demo-
graphic groups, regions, and industries. African Americans,
for example, experience much higher unemployment rates
than whites.
3. A person who decides to stop looking for work is considered
to have dropped out of the labor force and is no longer clas-
sified as unemployed. People who stop looking because they
are discouraged about finding a job are sometimes called
discouraged workers.
4. Some unemployment is inevitable. Because new workers are
continually entering the labor force, because industries and
firms are continuously expanding and contracting, and
because people switch jobs, there is a constant process of job
search as workers and firms try to match the best people to
the available jobs. This unemployment is both natural and
beneficial for the economy.
5. The unemployment that occurs because of short-run
job/skill-matching problems is called frictional
unemployment. The unemployment that occurs because of
longer-run structural changes in the economy is called
structural unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment
is the sum of the frictional rate and the structural rate. The
increase in unemployment that occurs during recessions and
depressions is called cyclical unemployment.
INFLATION p. 447
6. The consumer price index (CPI) is a fixed-weight price index.
It represents the “market basket” purchased by the typical
urban consumer.
7. Whether people gain or lose during a period of inflation
depends on whether their income rises faster or slower than
the prices of the things they buy. The elderly are more insu-
lated from inflation than most people think because Social
Security benefits and many pensions are indexed to inflation.
8. Inflation is likely to have a larger effect on the distribution of
income when it is unanticipated than when it is anticipated.
LONG-RUN GROWTH p. 452
9. Output growth depends on: (1) the growth rate of the capi-
tal stock, (2) the growth rate of output per unit of the capital
stock, (3) the growth rate of labor, and (4) the growth rate of
output per unit of labor.
10. Output per worker hour (labor productivity) rose faster in
the 1950s and 1960s than it rose from the 1970s to 2007. An
interesting question is whether labor productivity will rise
faster in the future because of the Internet.

natural rate and need not concern policy makers. Discuss that
statement and its relevance to the economy today.
3. What is the unemployment rate in your state today? What was it
in 1970, 1975, 1982, and 2008? How has your state done relative
to the national average? Do you know or can you determine why?
4. Suppose all wages, salaries, welfare benefits, and other sources of
income were indexed to inflation. Would inflation still be con-
sidered a problem? Why or why not?
5. Go to www.bls.gov and click on the links for state and area
employment and unemployment. Look at your home state and
describe what changes have taken place in the workforce. Has
the labor force participation rate gone up or down? Provide an
explanation for the rate change. Are your state’s experiences the
same as the rest of the country? Provide an explanation of why
your state’s experiences are the same as or different from the rest
of the country.
6. What do the CPI and the PPI measure? Why do we need both of
these price indexes? (Think about what purpose you would use
each one for.)
7. The consumer price index (CPI) is a fixed-weight index. It com-
pares the price of a fixed bundle of goods in one year with the
price of the same bundle of goods in some base year. Calculate
the price of a bundle containing 100 units of good X, 150 units
of good Y, and 25 units of good Z in 2008, 2009, and 2010.
Convert the results into an index by dividing each bundle price
figure by the bundle price in 2008. Calculate the percentage
change in your index between 2008 and 2009 and again between
2009 and 2010. Was there inflation between 2009 and 2010?
8. Consider the following statements:
a. More people are employed in Tappania now than at any time
in the past 50 years.
b. The unemployment rate in Tappania is higher now than it
has been in 50 years.
Can both of those statements be true at the same time? Explain.
9. Policy makers talk about the “capacity” of the economy to grow.
What specifically is meant by the “capacity” of the economy?
How might capacity be measured? In what ways is capacity lim-
ited by labor constraints and by capital constraints? What are
the consequences if demand in the economy exceeds capacity?
What signs would you look for?
10. What was the rate of growth in real GDP during the most recent
quarter? You can find the answer in publications such as the
Survey of Current Business, The Economist, and Business Week.
Has growth been increasing or decreasing? What policies might
you suggest for increasing the economy’s potential long-run rate
of growth?
11. Suppose the stock of capital and the workforce are both increas-
ing at 3 percent annually in the country of Wholand. At the
same time, real output is growing at 6 percent. How is that pos-
sible in the short run and in the long run?
12. Suppose the number of employed people in an economy is
121,166,640. The unemployment rate in this economy is
10.4 percent, or .104, and the labor force participation rate is
72.5 percent, or .725.
a. What is the size of the labor force?
b. How many people are unemployed?
c. What is the size of the working-age population?
13. On average, nations in Europe pay higher unemployment bene-
fits for longer periods of time than does the United States. How
do you suppose this would impact the unemployment rates in
these nations? Explain which type of unemployment you think
is most directly affected by the size and duration of unemploy-
ment benefits.
14. Consider the following four situations. In which situation
would a borrower be best off and in which situation would a
lender be best off?
a. The nominal interest rate is 14 percent and the inflation rate
is 17 percent.
b. The nominal interest rate is 7 percent and the inflation rate
is 3 percent.
c. The nominal interest rate is 4 percent and the inflation rate
is –2 percent.
d. The real interest rate is 6 percent and the inflation rate is
2 percent.
15. In each of the following cases, classify the person as cyclically
unemployed, structurally unemployed, frictionally unemployed,
or not in the labor force. Explain your answers.
a. Maya just graduated from a top medical school and is cur-
rently deciding which hospital emergency room job she
will accept.
b. Hector lost his job as an assembly line worker at Chrysler
due to the recession.
c. Alejandro, an advertising executive in Seattle, quit his job
one month ago to look for a more prestigious advertising job
in New York City. He is still looking for a job.
d. Yvonne got laid off from her job as a financial analyst 3 months
ago and has not looked for a new job since then.
e. Taylor lost his job as a welder due to the introduction of
robotic welding machines.
f. Ruby quit her job as a hotel concierge to become a full-time
student at a culinary school.
16. The consumer price index is 125 in year 1 and 160 in year 2. All
inflation is anticipated. If the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills
charges an interest rate of 35 percent in year 2, what is the
bank’s real interest rate?
17. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 450] Evaluate the
following statement: Because the CPI is a fixed-weight price
index, it has a tendency to overestimate the rate of inflation.
Therefore, if the CPI decreases, it must also have a tendency to
underestimate the rate of deflation.

We build up the macroeconomy slowly. In Chapters 23 and 24, we examine the market for goods and ser-
vices. In Chapters 25 and 26, we examine the money market. Then in Chapter 27, we bring the two markets
together, in so doing explaining the links between aggregate output (Y) and the interest rate (r), and derive
the aggregate demand curve. In Chapter 28, we introduce the aggregate supply curve and determine the price
level (P). We then explain in Chapter 29 how the labor market fits into the macroeconomic picture.
PART V
The Core of
Macroeconomic
Theory
We now begin our discussion of the theory of how the macroeconomy works.We know how to
calculate gross domestic product (GDP), but what factors determine it? We know how to define
and measure inflation and unemployment, but what circumstances cause inflation and unem-
ployment? What, if anything, can government do to reduce unemployment and inflation?
Analyzing the various components of the macroeconomy is a complex undertaking.
The level of GDP, the overall price level, and the level of employment—three chief concerns
of macroeconomists—are influenced by events in three broadly defined “markets”:
 Goods-and-services market
 Financial (money) market
 Labor market
We will explore each market, as well as the links between them, in our discussion of macro-
economic theory. Figure V.1 presents the plan of the next seven chapters, which form the

458
core of macroeconomic theory. In Chapters 23 and 24, we describe the market for goods and
services, often called the goods market. In Chapter 23, we explain several basic concepts and
show how the equilibrium level of output is determined in a simple economy with no gov-
ernment and no imports or exports. In Chapter 24, we add the government to the economy.
In Chapters 25 and 26, we focus on the money market. Chapter 25 introduces the money
market and the banking system and discusses the way the U.S. central bank (the Federal
Reserve) controls the money supply. Chapter 26 analyzes the demand for money and the way
interest rates are determined. Chapter 27 then examines the relationship between the goods
market and the money market and derives the aggregate demand curve. At the end of
Chapter 27, the equilibrium values of aggregate output and the interest rate are determined
for a given price level. Chapter 28 then uses the analysis from Chapter 27, adds the aggregate
supply curve, and determines the price level. Having then determined output, the interest
rate, and the price level, we are ready to analyze the effects of fiscal and monetary policies on
the economy. This is done in the second half of Chapter 28. Finally, Chapter 29 discusses the
supply of and demand for labor and the functioning of the labor market in the macroecon-
omy. This material is essential to understanding employment and unemployment.
Before we begin our discussion of aggregate output and income, we need to emphasize
that production, consumption, and other activities that we will be discussing in the follow-
ing chapters are ongoing activities. Nonetheless, it is helpful to think about these activities as
if they took place in a series of production periods. A period might be a month long or 
3 months long. During each period, output is produced, income is generated, and spending
takes place. At the end of each period, we can examine the results. Was everything that was
produced in the economy sold? What percentage of income was spent? What percentage was
saved? Is output (income) likely to rise or fall in the next period?

CHAPTER OUTLINE
459
Aggregate
Expenditure and
Equilibrium Output
In the last several chapters we
described a number of features of
the U.S. economy, including real
GDP, inflation, and unemploy-
ment, and we talked about how
they are measured. Now we begin
the analytical part of macroeco-
nomics: we begin to explain how it
is that the parts of the economy
interact to produce the time-profile
of the American economy that we
described in the last few chapters.
We begin with the simplest
case, focusing on households and
firms. Once we understand how households and firms interact at the aggregate level, we will intro-
duce government in Chapter 24. Our goal in this chapter is to provide you with a simplified model
that will let you see what happens to the economy as a whole when there is an increase in invest-
ment. If suddenly all the managers of firms in the economy decided to expand their plants, how
would that affect households and aggregate output? Because these are difficult questions, we start
with a simple model and then build up chapter by chapter.
As we work through our model of the economy, we will focus, at least initially, on understand-
ing movements in real gross domestic product (GDP), one of the central measures of macroeco-
nomic activity. Because we are interested in tracking real changes in the level of economic activity,
we focus on real, rather than nominal, output. So, while we will typically use dollars to measure
GDP, you should think about this as dollars corrected for price level changes.
We saw earlier that GDP can be calculated in terms of either income or expenditures. We will
use the variable Y to refer to both aggregate output and aggregate income.
Aggregate output can also be considered the aggregate quantity supplied because it is the
amount that firms are supplying (producing) during a period. In the discussions that follow, we
use the term aggregate output (income) instead of aggregate quantity supplied, but keep in mind
that the two are equivalent. Also remember that aggregate output means “real GDP.”
From the outset, you must think in “real terms.”For example, when we talk about output (Y),
we mean real output, not nominal output. Although we discussed in Chapter 21 that the calcula-
tion of real GDP is complicated, you can ignore these complications in the following analysis. To
help make things easier to read, we will frequently use dollar values for Y. But do not confuse Y
with nominal output. The main point is to think of Y as being in real terms—the quantities of
goods and services produced, not the dollars circulating in the economy.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory
The Keynesian Theory of Consumption
In 2005, the average American family spent about $1,350 on clothing. For high-income families
earning more than $148,000, the amount spent on clothing was substantially higher, at $3,700.We
all recognize that for consumption as a whole, as well as for consumption of most specific cate-
gories of goods and services, consumption rises with income. This relationship between con-
sumption and income is central to Keynes’s model of the economy. While Keynes recognized that
many factors, including wealth and interest rates, play a role in determining consumption levels in
the economy, in his classic The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, current income
played the key role:
The fundamental psychological law, upon which we are entitled to depend with great
confidence both a priori from our knowledge of human nature and from the detailed
facts of experience, is that men [and women, too] are disposed, as a rule and on average,
to increase their consumption as their incomes increase, but not by as much as the
increase in their income .1
Keynes is telling us two things in this quote. First, if you find your income going up, you will
spend more than you did before. But Keynes is also saying something about how much more you
will spend: He predicts—based on his looking at the data and his understanding of people—that
the rise in consumption will be less than the full rise in income. This simple observation plays a
large role in helping us understand the workings of the aggregate economy.
The relationship between consumption and income is called a consumption function.
Figure 23.1 shows a hypothetical consumption function for an individual household. The curve
is labeled c(y), which is read “c is a function of y,” or “consumption is a function of income.”
Note that we have drawn the line with an upward slope, reflecting that consumption increases
with income. To reflect Keynes’s view that consumption increases less than one for one with
income, we have drawn the consumption function with a slope of less than 1. The consumption
function in Figure 23.1 is a straight line, telling us that an increase in income of $1 leads to the
same increase in consumption regardless of the initial value of income. In practice, the con-
sumption function may be curved, with the slope decreasing as income increases. This would
tell us that the typical consumer spends less of the incremental income received as his or her
income rises.
The consumption function in Figure 23.1 represents an individual household. In macroeco-
nomics, however, we are interested in the behavior of the economy as a whole, the aggregate con-
sumption of all households in the economy in relation to aggregate income. Figure 23.2 shows this

CHAPTER 23
Aggregate Expenditure and Equilibrium Output 461
aggregate consumption function, again using a straight line, or constant slope, for simplicity.
With a straight line consumption curve, we can use the following equation to describe the curve:
C = a + bY
Y is aggregate output (income), C is aggregate consumption, and a is the point at which the con-
sumption function intersects the C-axis—a constant. The letter b is the slope of the line, in this
case C/Y [because consumption (C) is measured on the vertical axis and income (Y) is mea-
sured on the horizontal axis].2 Every time income increases (say by Y), consumption increases
by b times Y. Thus, C = b  Y and C/Y = b. Suppose, for example, that the slope of the
line in Figure 23.2 is .75 (that is, b = .75). An increase in income (Y) of $1,000 would then
increase consumption by bY = .75  $1,000, or $750.
The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of a change in income that is
consumed. In the consumption function here, b is the MPC. An MPC of .75 means consumption
changes by .75 of the change in income. The slope of the consumption function is the MPC. An
MPC less than 1 tells us that individuals spend less than 100 percent of their income increase, just
as Keynes suggested.

Aggregate saving (S) in the economy, denoted S, is the difference between aggregate
income and aggregate consumption:
The triple equal sign means that this equation is an identity,or something that is always true by defin-
ition. This equation simply says that income that is not consumed must be saved. If $0.75 of a 
$1.00 increase in income goes to consumption, $0.25 must go to saving. If income decreases by $1.00,
consumption will decrease by $0.75 and saving will decrease by $0.25. The marginal propensity to
save (MPS) is the fraction of a change in income that is saved: S/Y, where S is the change in sav-
ing. Because everything not consumed is saved, the MPC and the MPS must add up to 1.
S K Y - C
Because the MPC and the MPS are important concepts, it may help to review their defin-
itions. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of an increase in income
that is consumed (or the fraction of a decrease in income that comes out of consumption).
MPC + MPS 1
2 The Greek letter  (delta) means “change in.” For example, Y (read “delta Y”) means the “change in income.” If income (Y) in
2007 is $100 and income in 2008 is $110, then Y for this period is $110 - $100 = $10. For a review of the concept of slope, see

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory
The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the fraction of an increase in income that is saved
(or the fraction of a decrease in income that comes out of saving).
The numerical examples used in the rest of this chapter are based on the following consump-
tion function:
This equation is simply an extension of the generic C = a + bY consumption function we have
been discussing, where a is 100 and b is .75. This function is graphed in Figure 23.3.
Since saving and consumption by definition add up to income, we can use the consump-
tion curve to tell us about both consumption and saving. We do this in Figure 23.4. In this fig-
ure, we have drawn a 45° line from the origin. Everywhere along this line aggregate
consumption is equal to aggregate income. Therefore, saving is zero. Where the consumption
curve is above the 45° line, consumption exceeds income and saving is negative. Where the con-
sumption function crosses the 45° line, consumption is equal to income and saving is zero.
Where the consumption function is below the 45° line, consumption is less than income and
saving is positive. Note that the slope of the saving function is S/Y, which is equal to the
marginal propensity to save (MPS). The consumption function and the saving function are
mirror images of each other. No information appears in one that does not appear in the other.
These functions tell us how households in the aggregate will divide income between consump-
tion spending and saving at every possible income level. In other words, they embody aggregate
household behavior.

Other Determinants of Consumption
The assumption that consumption depends only on income is obviously a simplification. In prac-
tice, the decisions of households on how much to consume in a given period are also affected by
their wealth, by the interest rate, and by their expectations of the future. Households with higher
wealth are likely to spend more, other things being equal, than households with less wealth.
The boom in the U.S. stock market in the last half of the 1990s and the boom in housing
prices between 2003 and 2005, both of which increased household wealth substantially, led house-
holds to consume more than they otherwise would have in these periods. In 2009–2010, after a fall
in housing prices and the stock market, consumption was less than it otherwise would have been.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Behavioral Biases in Saving Behavior
This chapter has described how saving is related to income.
Economists have generally assumed that people make their
saving decisions rationally, just as they make other decisions
about choices in consumption and the labor market. Saving
decisions involve thinking about trade-offs between present
and future consumption.Recent work in behavioral economics
has highlighted the role of psychological biases in saving
behavior and has demonstrated that seemingly small changes
in the way saving programs are designed can result in big
behavioral changes.
Many retirement plans are designed with an opt-in fea-
ture. That is, you need to take some action to enroll. Typically,
when you begin a job, you need to check yes on the retire-
ment plan enrollment form. Recent work in economics by
James Choi of Yale University and Bridget Madrian and
Dennis Shea of the University of Chicago suggests that simply
changing the enrollment process from the opt-in structure
just described to an opt-out system in which people are auto-
matically enrolled unless they check the no box dramatically
increases enrollment in retirement pension plans. In one
study, the change from an opt-in to an opt-out system
increased pension plan enrollment after 3 months of work
from 65 percent to 98 percent of workers.
Behavioral economists have administered a number of sur-
veys suggesting that people, on average, think they save too lit-
tle of their income for retirement. Shlomo Benartzi, from the
University of California, Los Angeles, and Richard Thaler,
from the University of Chicago, devised a retirement program
to try to increase saving rates. Under this plan, called Save
More Tomorrow, employees are offered a program that allows
them to precommit to save more whenever they get a pay
raise. Behavioral economists argue that people find this option
attractive because it is easier for them to commit to making
sacrifices tomorrow than it is for them to make those sacrifices
today. (This is why many people resolve to diet some time in
the future but continue to overeat today.) The Save More
Tomorrow retirement plans have been put in place in a num-
ber of companies, including Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and
TIAA-CREF. Early results suggest dramatic increases in the
saving rates of those enrolled, with saving rates quadrupling
after 4 years and four pay raises.
For many households, interest rates also figure in to consumption and saving decisions. Lower
interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, so lower interest rates are likely to stimulate spending.
(Conversely, higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and are likely to decrease spending.)
Finally,as households think about what fraction of incremental income to consume versus save,their
expectations about the future may also play a role. If households are optimistic and expect to do bet-
ter in the future, they may spend more at present than if they think the future will be bleak.
Household expectations are also important regarding households’ responses to changes in
their income. If, for example, the government announces a tax cut, which increases after-tax
income, households’ responses to the tax cut will likely depend on whether the tax cut is expected
to be temporary or permanent. If households expect that the tax cut will be in effect for only two
years, their responses are likely to be smaller than if they expect the tax cut to be permanent.
We examine these issues in Chapter 31, where we take a closer look at household behavior
regarding both consumption and labor supply. But for now, we will focus only on income as
affecting consumption.
Planned Investment (I)
The output of an economy consists not only of goods consumed by households, but investments
made by firms. Some firms’ investments are in the form of plants and equipment. These are not
very different from consumption of households. In a given period, a firm might buy $500,000 of
new machinery, which would be part of aggregate output for the period, as would the purchase of
automobiles by households. In Chapter 21, you learned that firms’ investments also include

inventories. Understanding how firms invest in inventories is a little more complicated, but it is
important for understanding the way the macroeconomy works.
A firm’s inventory is the stock of goods that it has awaiting sale. For many reasons, most
firms want to hold some inventory. It is hard to predict exactly when consumers will want to
purchase a new refrigerator, and most customers are not patient. Sometimes it is cheaper to
produce goods in larger volumes than current demand requires, which leads firms to want 
to have inventory. From a macroeconomic perspective, however, inventory differs from other
capital investments in one very important way: While purchases by firms of machinery and
equipment are always deliberate, sometimes inventories build up (or decline) without any
deliberate plan by firms. For this reason, there can be a difference between planned investment,
which consists of the investments firms plan to make, and actual investment, which consists
of all of firms’ investments, including their unplanned changes in inventories.
Why are inventories sometimes different from what was planned? Recall that firms hold
planned inventories in anticipation of sales, recognizing that the exact timing of sales may be
uncertain. If a firm overestimates how much it will sell in a period, it will end up with more in
inventory than it planned to have. On other occasions, inventories may be lower than planned
when sales are stronger than expected.
We will use I to refer only to planned investment.As we will see shortly, the economy is in equi-
librium only when planned investment and actual investment are equal. The determinants of
planned investment will be explored in later chapters. For the rest of this chapter we will assume
that firms’ planned investment is fixed and does not depend on income. We show this case in
Figure 23.5, where planned investment is fixed at a level of 25.
The Determination of Equilibrium Output
(Income)
Thus far, we have described the behavior of firms and households. We now discuss the nature of
equilibrium and explain how the economy achieves equilibrium.
A number of definitions of equilibrium are used in economics. They all refer to the idea that
at equilibrium, there is no tendency for change. In microeconomics, equilibrium is said to exist in
a particular market (for example, the market for bananas) at the price for which the quantity
demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. At this point, both suppliers and demanders are sat-
isfied. The equilibrium price of a good is the price at which suppliers want to furnish the amount
that demanders want to buy.
To define equilibrium for the macroeconomy, we start with a new variable, planned
aggregate expenditure (AE). Planned aggregate expenditure is, by definition, consumption
plus planned investment:
AE  C + I

there is no tendency for

goods market, equilibrium

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory
Note that I is planned investment spending only. It does not include any unplanned increases or
decreases in inventory. Note also that this is a definition. Aggregate expenditure is always equal to
C + I, and we write it with the triple equal sign.
The economy is defined to be in equilibrium when aggregate output (Y) is equal to planned
aggregate expenditure (AE).
Equilibrium: Y = AE
Because AE is, by definition, C + I, equilibrium can also be written:
Equilibrium: Y = C + I
It will help in understanding the equilibrium concept to consider what happens if the econ-
omy is out of equilibrium. First, suppose aggregate output is greater than planned aggregate
expenditure:
When output is greater than planned spending, there is unplanned inventory investment. Firms
planned to sell more of their goods than they sold, and the difference shows up as an unplanned
increase in inventories.
Next, suppose planned aggregate expenditure is greater than aggregate output:
When planned spending exceeds output, firms have sold more than they planned to. Inventory
investment is smaller than planned. Planned and actual investment are not equal. Only when
output is exactly matched by planned spending will there be no unplanned inventory investment.
If there is unplanned inventory investment, this will be a state of disequilibrium. The mechanism
by which the economy returns to equilibrium will be discussed later. Equilibrium in the goods
market is achieved only when aggregate output (Y) and planned aggregate expenditure (C + I)
are equal, or when actual and planned investment are equal.
Table 23.1 derives a planned aggregate expenditure schedule and shows the point of equi-
librium for our numerical example. (Remember, all our calculations are based on C = 100 +
.75Y). To determine planned aggregate expenditure, we add consumption spending (C) to
planned investment spending (I) at every level of income. Glancing down columns 1 and 4, we
see one and only one level at which aggregate output and planned aggregate expenditure are
equal: Y = 500.

Equilibrium Aggregate
Output
Equilibrium occurs when
planned aggregate expenditure
and aggregate output are equal.
Planned aggregate expenditure 
is the sum of consumption
spending and planned invest-
ment spending.
Figure 23.6 illustrates the same equilibrium graphically. Figure 23.6a adds planned invest-
ment, constant at 25, to consumption at every level of income. Because planned investment is a
constant, the planned aggregate expenditure function is simply the consumption function dis-
placed vertically by that constant amount. Figure 23.6b shows the planned aggregate expenditure
function with the 45° line. The 45° line represents all points on the graph where the variables on
the horizontal and vertical axes are equal. Any point on the 45° line is a potential equilibrium
point. The planned aggregate expenditure function crosses the 45° line at a single point, where 
Y = 500. (The point at which the two lines cross is sometimes called the Keynesian cross.) At that
point, Y = C + I.
Now let us look at some other levels of aggregate output (income). First, consider Y = 800. Is
this an equilibrium output? Clearly, it is not. At Y = 800, planned aggregate expenditure is 725
(see Table 23.1). This amount is less than aggregate output, which is 800. Because output is
greater than planned spending, the difference ends up in inventory as unplanned inventory
investment. In this case, unplanned inventory investment is 75. In the aggregate, firms have more
inventory than desired. As a result, firms have an incentive to change their production plans
going forward. In this sense, the economy will not be in equilibrium.
Next, consider Y = 200. Is this an equilibrium output? No. At Y = 200, planned aggregate
expenditure is 275. Planned spending (AE) is greater than output (Y), and there is  an unplanned
fall in inventory investment of 75. Again, firms in the aggregate will experience a different result
from what they expected.
At Y = 200 and Y = 800, planned investment and actual investment are unequal. There is
unplanned investment, and the system is out of balance. Only at Y = 500, where planned aggregate
expenditure and aggregate output are equal, will planned investment equal actual investment.

468
PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory
Finally, let us find the equilibrium level of output (income) algebraically. Recall that we
know the following:
By substituting (2) and (3) into (1), we get:
There is only one value of Y for which this statement is true, and we can find it by
rearranging terms:
The equilibrium level of output is 500, as shown in Table 23.1 and Figure 23.6.
The Saving/Investment Approach to Equilibrium
Because aggregate income must be saved or spent, by definition, Y  C + S, which is an identity.
The equilibrium condition is Y = C + I, but this is not an identity because it does not hold 
when we are out of equilibrium.3 By substituting C + S for Y in the equilibrium condition, we 
can write:
Because we can subtract C from both sides of this equation, we are left with:
Thus, only when planned investment equals saving will there be equilibrium.
Figure 23.7 reproduces the saving schedule derived in Figure 23.4 and the horizontal invest-
ment function from Figure 23.5. Notice that S = I at one and only one level of aggregate output,
Y = 500. At Y = 500, C = 475 and I = 25. In other words, Y = C + I; therefore, equilibrium exists.

CHAPTER 23
Aggregate Expenditure and Equilibrium Output 469
Adjustment to Equilibrium
We have defined equilibrium and learned how to find it, but we have said nothing about how
firms might react to disequilibrium. Let us consider the actions firms might take when planned
aggregate expenditure exceeds aggregate output (income).
We already know the only way firms can sell more than they produce is by selling some
inventory. This means that when planned aggregate expenditure exceeds aggregate output,
unplanned inventory reductions have occurred. It seems reasonable to assume that firms will
respond to unplanned inventory reductions by increasing output. If firms increase output,
income must also increase. (Output and income are two ways of measuring the same thing.) As
GM builds more cars, it hires more workers (or pays its existing workforce for working more
hours), buys more steel, uses more electricity, and so on. These purchases by GM represent
income for the producers of labor, steel, electricity, and so on. When firms try to keep their inven-
tories intact by increasing production, this will generate more income in the economy as a whole.
This will lead to more consumption. Remember, when income rises, so does consumption. The
adjustment process will continue as long as output (income) is below planned aggregate expen-
diture. If firms react to unplanned inventory reductions by increasing output, an economy with
planned spending greater than output will adjust to equilibrium, with Y higher than before. If
planned spending is less than output, there will be unplanned increases in inventories. In this
case, firms will respond by reducing output. As output falls, income falls, consumption falls, and
so on, until equilibrium is restored, with Y lower than before.
As Figure 23.6 shows, at any level of output above Y = 500, such as Y = 800, output will fall
until it reaches equilibrium at Y = 500, and at any level of output below Y = 500, such as Y = 200,
output will rise until it reaches equilibrium at Y = 500.4
The Multiplier
The model we have developed lets us answer the question we posed at the beginning of this chap-
ter: What happens to the level of real output if all of the managers in the economy suddenly
decide to increase planned investment from, say, 25 to 50? It may surprise you to learn that the
change in equilibrium output will be greater than the initial change in planned investment. In
fact, output will change by a multiple of the change in planned investment.
The multiplier is defined as the ratio of the change in the equilibrium level of output to a
change in some exogenous variable. An exogenous variable is a variable that is assumed not to
depend on the state of the economy—that is, a variable is exogenous if it does not change in
response to changes in the economy. In this chapter, we consider planned investment to be exoge-
nous. This simplifies our analysis and provides a foundation for later discussions.
With planned investment exogenous, we can ask how much the equilibrium level of output
changes when planned investment changes.Remember that we are not trying to explain why planned
investment changes; we are simply asking how much the equilibrium level of output changes when
(for whatever reason) planned investment changes. (Beginning in Chapter 27, we will no longer take
planned investment as given and will explain how planned investment is determined.)
Consider a sustained increase in planned investment of 25—that is, suppose I increases from
25 to 50 and stays at 50. If equilibrium existed at I = 25, an increase in planned investment of 25
will cause a disequilibrium, with planned aggregate expenditure greater than aggregate output by
25. Firms immediately see unplanned reductions in their inventories. As a result, firms begin to
increase output.
Let us say the increase in planned investment comes from an anticipated increase in travel
that leads airlines to purchase more airplanes, car rental companies to increase purchases of auto-
mobiles, and bus companies to purchase more buses (all capital goods). The firms experiencing
4 In discussing simple supply and demand equilibrium in Chapters 3 and 4, we saw that when quantity supplied exceeds quantity
demanded, the price falls and the quantity supplied declines. Similarly, when quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, the price
rises and the quantity supplied increases. In the analysis here, we are ignoring potential changes in prices or in the price level and
focusing on changes in the level of real output (income). Later, after we have introduced money and the price level into the analysis,
prices will be very important. At this stage, however, only aggregate output (income) (Y) adjusts when aggregate expenditure exceeds
aggregate output (with inventory falling) or when aggregate output exceeds aggregate expenditure (with inventory rising).

The Core of Macroeconomic Theory
unplanned inventory declines will be automobile manufacturers, bus producers, and aircraft
producers—GM, Ford, Boeing, and so on. In response to declining inventories of planes, buses,
and cars, these firms will increase output.
Now suppose these firms raise output by the full 25 increase in planned investment. Does
this restore equilibrium? No, it does not because when output goes up, people earn more income
and a part of that income will be spent. This increases planned aggregate expenditure even fur-
ther. In other words, an increase in I also leads indirectly to an increase in C. To produce more air-
planes, Boeing has to hire more workers or ask its existing employees to work more hours. It also
must buy more engines from General Electric, more tires from Goodyear, and so on. Owners of
these firms will earn more profits, produce more, hire more workers, and pay out more in wages
and salaries. This added income does not vanish into thin air. It is paid to households that spend
some of it and save the rest. The added production leads to added income, which leads to added
consumption spending.
If planned investment (I) goes up by 25 initially and is sustained at this higher level, an
increase of output of 25 will not restore equilibrium because it generates even more consumption
spending (C). People buy more consumer goods. There are unplanned reductions of inventories
of basic consumption items—washing machines, food, clothing, and so on—and this prompts
other firms to increase output. The cycle starts all over again.
Output and income can rise significantly more than the initial increase in planned invest-
ment, but how much and how large is the multiplier? This is answered graphically in Figure 23.8.
Assume that the economy is in equilibrium at point A, where equilibrium output is 500. The
increase in I of 25 shifts the AE  C + I curve up by 25 because I is higher by 25 at every level
of income. The new equilibrium occurs at point B, where the equilibrium level of output is
600. Like point A, point B is on the 45° line and is an equilibrium value. Output (Y) has
increased by 100 (600 - 500), or four times the initial increase in planned investment of 25,
between point A and point B. The multiplier in this example is 4. At point B, aggregate spend-
ing is also higher by 100. If 25 of this additional 100 is investment (I), as we know it is, the
remaining 75 is added consumption (C). From point A to point B then, Y = 100, I = 25,
and C = 75.

At point A, the economy is in

As output rises in response,
additional consumption is gener-
ated, pushing equilibrium output
up by a multiple of the initial
increase in I. The new equilib-
rium is found at point B, where 
Y = 600. Equilibrium output has
increased by 100 (600 - 500), or
four times the amount of the
increase in planned investment.

CHAPTER 23
Aggregate Expenditure and Equilibrium Output 471
Why doesn’t the multiplier process go on forever? The answer is that only a fraction of the
increase in income is consumed in each round. Successive increases in income become smaller
and smaller in each round of the multiplier process, due to leakage as saving, until equilibrium
is restored.
The size of the multiplier depends on the slope of the planned aggregate expenditure line.
The steeper the slope of this line, the greater the change in output for a given change in invest-
ment. When planned investment is fixed, as in our example, the slope of the AE  C + I line is
just the marginal propensity to consume (C/Y). The greater the MPC, the greater the multi-
plier. This should not be surprising. A large MPC means that consumption increases a great deal
when income increases. The more consumption changes, the more output has to change to
achieve equilibrium.
The Multiplier Equation
Is there a way to determine the size of the multiplier without using graphic analysis? Yes, there is.
Assume that the market is in equilibrium at an income level of Y = 500. Now suppose
planned investment (I)—thus, planned aggregate expenditure (AE)—increases and remains
higher by 25. Planned aggregate expenditure is greater than output, there is an unplanned inven-
tory reduction, and firms respond by increasing output (income) (Y). This leads to a second
round of increases, and so on.
What will restore equilibrium? Look at Figure 23.7 and recall: Planned aggregate expendi-
ture (AE  C + I) is not equal to aggregate output (Y) unless S = I; the leakage of saving must
exactly match the injection of planned investment spending for the economy to be in equilib-
rium. Recall also that we assumed that planned investment jumps to a new, higher level and
stays there; it is a sustained increase of 25 in planned investment spending. As income rises,
consumption rises and so does saving. Our S = I approach to equilibrium leads us to conclude
that equilibrium will be restored only when saving has increased by exactly the amount of the
initial increase in I. Otherwise, I will continue to be greater than S and C + I will continue to be
greater than Y. (The S = I approach to equilibrium leads to an interesting paradox in the
macroeconomy. See the following Economics in Practice, “The Paradox of Thrift.”)
It is possible to figure how much Y must increase in response to the additional planned
investment before equilibrium will be restored. Y will rise, pulling S up with it until the
change in saving is exactly equal to the change in planned investment—that is, until S is again
equal to I at its new higher level. Because added saving is a fraction of added income (the
MPS), the increase in income required to restore equilibrium must be a multiple of the
increase in planned investment.
Recall that the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the fraction of a change in income that
is saved. It is defined as the change in S (S) over the change in income (Y):
Because S must be equal to I for equilibrium to be restored, we can substitute I for S and
solve:
Therefore,
As you can see, the change in equilibrium income (Y) is equal to the initial change in
planned investment (I) times 1/MPS. The multiplier is 1/MPS:

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
The Paradox of Thrift
An interesting paradox can arise when households attempt to
increase their saving. What happens if households become
concerned about the future and want to save more today to be
prepared for hard times tomorrow? If households increase
their planned saving, the saving schedule in the graph below
shifts upward from S0 to S1. The plan to save more is a plan to
consume less, and the resulting drop in spending leads to a
drop in income. Income drops by a multiple of the initial
shift in the saving schedule. Before the increase in saving,
equilibrium exists at point A, where S0 = I and Y = 500.
Increased saving shifts the equilibrium to point B, the point
at which S1 = I. New equilibrium output is 300—a 200
decrease (Y) from the initial equilibrium.
By consuming less, households have actually caused the hard
times about which they were apprehensive. Worse, the new
equilibrium finds saving at the same level as it was before con-
sumption dropped (25). In their attempt to save more, house-
holds have caused a contraction in output, and thus in income.
They end up consuming less, but they have not saved any more.
It should be clear why saving at the new equilibrium is
equal to saving at the old equilibrium. Equilibrium requires
that saving equals planned investment, and because
planned investment is unchanged, saving must remain
unchanged for equilibrium to exist. This paradox shows
that the interactions among sectors in the economy can be
of crucial importance.
The paradox of thrift is “paradoxical” because it contra-
dicts the widely held belief that “a penny saved is a penny
earned.” This may be true for an individual, but when society
as a whole saves more, the result is a drop in income but no
increased saving.
Does the paradox of thrift always hold? Recall our
assumption that planned investment is fixed. Let us drop
this assumption for a moment. If the extra saving that
households want to do to ward off hard times is channeled
into additional investment through financial markets, there
is a shift up in the I schedule. The paradox could then be
averted. If investment increases, a new equilibrium can be
achieved at a higher level of saving and income. This result,
however, depends critically on the existence of a channel
through which additional household saving finances addi-
tional investment.

The Paradox of Thrift
An increase in planned saving from S0 to S1 causes equilibrium output to decrease from 
500 to 300. The decreased consumption that accompanies increased saving leads to a con-
traction of the economy and to a reduction of income. But at the new equilibrium, saving is
the same as it was at the initial equilibrium. Increased efforts to save have caused a drop in
income but no overall change in saving.

CHAPTER 23
Aggregate Expenditure and Equilibrium Output 473
In our example, the MPC is .75; so the MPS must equal 1 - .75, or .25. Thus, the multiplier is 1
divided by .25, or 4. The change in the equilibrium level of Y is 4  25, or 100.5 Also note that the
same analysis holds when planned investment falls. If planned investment falls by a certain
amount and is sustained at this lower level, output will fall by a multiple of the reduction in I. As
the initial shock is felt and firms cut output, they lay people off. The result: Income, and subse-
quently consumption, falls.
The Size of the Multiplier in the Real World
In considering the size of the multiplier, it is important to realize that the multiplier we derived in
this chapter is based on a very simplified picture of the economy. First, we have assumed that
planned investment is exogenous and does not respond to changes in the economy. Second, we
have thus far ignored the role of government, financial markets, and the rest of the world in the
macroeconomy. For these reasons, it would be a mistake to move on from this chapter thinking
that national income can be increased by $100 billion simply by increasing planned investment
spending by $25 billion.
As we relax these assumptions in the following chapters, you will see that most of what we add
to make our analysis more realistic has the effect of reducing the size of the multiplier. For example:
1. The Appendix to Chapter 24 shows that when tax payments depend on income (as they do
in the real world), the size of the multiplier is reduced. As the economy expands, tax pay-
ments increase and act as a drag on the economy. The multiplier effect is smaller.
2. We will see in Chapter 27 that planned investment (I) is not exogenous; instead, it depends on
the interest rate in the economy. This too has the effect of reducing the size of the multiplier.
3. Thus far we have not discussed how the overall price level is determined in the economy.
When we do (in Chapter 28), we will see that part of an expansion of the economy is likely
to take the form of an increase in the price level instead of an increase in output. When this
happens, the size of the multiplier is reduced.
4. The multiplier is also reduced when imports are introduced (in Chapter 35), because some
domestic spending leaks into foreign markets.
These juicy tidbits give you something to look forward to as you proceed through the rest of this
book. For now, however, it is enough to point out that in reality the size of the multiplier is about
2. That is, a sustained increase in exogenous spending of $10 billion into the U.S. economy can be
expected to raise real GDP over time by about $20 billion. This is much lower than the value of 4
that we used in this chapter.
Looking Ahead
In this chapter, we took the first step toward understanding how the economy works.We assumed
that consumption depends on income, that planned investment is fixed, and that there is equilib-
rium. We discussed how the economy might adjust back to equilibrium when it is out of equilib-
rium. We also discussed the effects on equilibrium output from a change in planned investment
and derived the multiplier. In the next chapter, we retain these assumptions and add the govern-
ment to the economy.
5 The multiplier can also be derived algebraically, as the Appendix to this chapter demonstrates.

2. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of
a change in income that is consumed, or spent. The marginal

income that is saved. Because all income must be saved or

4. Planned aggregate expenditure (AE) equals consumption plus
planned investment: AE  C + I. Equilibrium in the goods
market is achieved when planned aggregate expenditure
equals aggregate output: C + I = Y. This holds if and only if
planned investment and actual investment are equal.
5. Because aggregate income must be saved or spent, the equi-
librium condition Y = C + I can be rewritten as C + S = C +
I, or S = I. Only when planned investment equals saving will
there be equilibrium. This approach to equilibrium is the
saving/ investment approach to equilibrium.
6. When planned aggregate expenditure exceeds aggregate out-
put (income), there is an unplanned fall in inventories. Firms
will increase output. This increased output leads to increased
income and even more consumption. This process will con-
tinue as long as output (income) is below planned aggregate
expenditure. If firms react to unplanned inventory reduc-
tions by increasing output, an economy with planned spend-
ing greater than output will adjust to a new equilibrium,
with Y higher than before.
THE MULTIPLIER p. 469 
7. Equilibrium output changes by a multiple of the change in
planned investment or any other exogenous variable. The
multiplier is 1/MPS.
8. When households increase their planned saving, income
decreases and saving does not change. Saving does not
increase because in equilibrium, saving must equal planned
investment and planned investment is fixed. If planned
investment also increased, this paradox of thrift could be
averted and a new equilibrium could be achieved at a higher
level of saving and income. This result depends on the exis-
tence of a channel through which additional household sav-
ing finances additional investment.

compute using the multiplier?
5. Explain the multiplier intuitively. Why is it that an increase in
planned investment of $100 raises equilibrium output by more

You are asked by the business editor of the Weird Herald, the

7. This chapter argued that saving and spending behavior
depended in part on wealth (accumulated savings and inheri-
tance), but our simple model does not incorporate this effect.
Consider the following model of a very simple economy:
If you assume that wealth (W) and investment (I) remain con-
stant (we are ignoring the fact that saving adds to the stock of
wealth), what are the equilibrium levels of GDP (Y), consump-
tion (C), and saving (S)? Now suppose that wealth increases by
50 percent to 1,500. Recalculate the equilibrium levels of Y, C,
and S. What impact does wealth accumulation have on GDP?
Many were concerned with the very large increase in stock val-
ues in the late 1990s. Does this present a problem for the econ-
omy? Explain.
8. You learned earlier that expenditures and income should
always be equal. In this chapter, you learned that AE and aggre-
gate output (income) can be different. Is there an inconsistency
here? Explain.
9. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 464] The
Economics in Practice describes some of the difficulties that
households have with regard to decisions involving trade-offs
between the present and the future. Explain briefly how the
problem of global warming and the problem of adequate
household saving are similar. Describe ways in which the con-
cept of opportunity costs can be used to frame these two prob-
lems. What barriers might prevent households or societies
from achieving satisfactory outcomes? 
10. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 472] If households
decide to save more, saving in the aggregate may fall. Explain
this in words.
11. Suppose that in the year 2010, Celestial Electronics planned to
produce 950,000 units of its portable GPS devices. Of the
950,000 it planned to produce, a total of 25,000 units would
be added to the inventory at its new plant in Florida. Also
assume that these units have been selling at a price of $100
each and that the price has been constant over time. Suppose
further that this year the firm built a new plant for $5 million
and acquired $2.5 million worth of equipment. It had no
other investment projects, and to avoid complications,
assume no depreciation.
Now suppose that at the end of the year, Celestial had produced
950,000 units but had only sold 900,000 units and that invento-
ries now contained 50,000 units more than they had at the
beginning of the year. At $100 each, that means that the firm
added $5,000,000 in new inventory.
a. How much did Celestial actually invest this year?
b. How much did it plan to invest?
c. Would Celestial produce more or fewer units next year? Why?

b. What is the value of the MPS?
c. What is the value of the multiplier?
d. What is the amount of unplanned investment at aggregate
output of 300, 900, and 1,300?
13. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, during the
recession of 2007–2009, household saving as a fraction of dis-
posable personal income increased from a low of just over 
1 percent in the first quarter of 2008 to 5 percent in the second
quarter of 2009. All else equal, what impact would this change
in saving have on the MPC, MPS, and multiplier? How would
this change affect equilibrium output when planned invest-
ment changes?
14. Assume in a simple economy that the level of saving is –500 when
aggregate output equals zero and that the marginal propensity to
save is 0.2. Derive the saving function and the consumption func-
tion, and draw a graph showing these functions. At what level of
aggregate output does the consumption curve cross the 45° line?
Explain your answer and show this on the graph.
We can then solve for Y in terms of I by dividing through 
by (1 - b):
Now look carefully at this expression and think about increas-
ing I by some amount, I, with a held constant. If I increases by

CHAPTER 23 APPENDIX
Deriving the Multiplier Algebraically
In addition to deriving the multiplier using the simple substi-
tution we used in the chapter, we can also derive the formula
for the multiplier by using simple algebra.
Recall that our consumption function is:
C = a + bY
where b is the marginal propensity to consume. In equilibrium:
Y = C + I
Now we solve these two equations for Y in terms of I. By substi-
tuting the first equation into the second, we get:
This equation can be rearranged to yield:
Y(1 - b) = a + I
Y - bY = a + I

The Government and
Fiscal Policy
Nothing in macroeconomics or
microeconomics arouses as much
controversy as the role of government
in the economy.
In microeconomics, the active
presence of government in regulating
competition, providing roads and
education,
and 
redistributing
income is applauded by those who
believe a free market simply does not
work well when left to its own
devices. Opponents of government
intervention say it is the government,
not the market, that performs badly.
They say bureaucracy and ineffi-
ciency could be eliminated or reduced if the government played a smaller role in the economy.
In macroeconomics, the debate over what the government can and should do has a similar
flavor. At one end of the spectrum are the Keynesians and their intellectual descendants who
believe that the macroeconomy is likely to fluctuate too much if left on its own and that the gov-
ernment should smooth out fluctuations in the business cycle. These ideas can be traced to
Keynes’s analysis in The General Theory, which suggests that governments can use their taxing
and spending powers to increase aggregate expenditure (and thereby stimulate aggregate output)
in recessions or depressions. At the other end of the spectrum are those who claim that govern-
ment spending is incapable of stabilizing the economy, or worse, is destabilizing and harmful.
Perhaps the one thing most people can agree on is that, like it or not, governments are
important actors in the economies of virtually all countries. For this reason alone, it is worth our
while to analyze the way government influences the functioning of the macroeconomy.
The government has a variety of powers—including regulating firms’ entry into and exit
from an industry, setting standards for product quality, setting minimum wage levels, and reg-
ulating the disclosure of information—but in macroeconomics, we study a government with
general but limited powers. Specifically, government can affect the macroeconomy through
two policy channels: fiscal policy and monetary policy. Fiscal policy, the focus of this chapter,
refers to the government’s spending and taxing behavior—in other words, its budget policy.
(The word fiscal comes from the root fisc, which refers to the “treasury” of a government.)
Fiscal policy is generally divided into three categories: (1) policies concerning government pur-
chases of goods and services, (2) policies concerning taxes, and (3) policies concerning transfer
payments (such as unemployment compensation, Social Security benefits, welfare payments,
and veterans’ benefits) to households. Monetary policy, which we consider in the next two
chapters, refers to the behavior of the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, concerning the
nation’s money supply.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
Government in the Economy
Given the scope and power of local, state, and federal governments, there are some matters over
which they exert great control and some matters beyond their control. We need to distinguish
between variables that a government controls directly and variables that are a consequence of
government decisions combined with the state of the economy.
For example, tax rates are controlled by the government. By law, Congress has the authority
to decide who and what should be taxed and at what rate. Tax revenue, on the other hand, is not
subject to complete control by the government. Revenue from the personal income tax system
depends on personal tax rates (which Congress sets) and on the income of the household sector
(which depends on many factors not under direct government control, such as how much house-
holds decide to work). Revenue from the corporate profits tax depends on both corporate profits
tax rates and the size of corporate profits. The government controls corporate tax rates but not
the size of corporate profits.
Some government spending also depends on government decisions and on the state of the
economy. For example, in the United States, the unemployment insurance program pays benefits
to unemployed people. When the economy goes into a recession, the number of unemployed
workers increases and so does the level of government unemployment insurance payments.
Because taxes and spending often go up or down in response to changes in the economy
instead of as the result of deliberate decisions by policy makers, we will occasionally use
discretionary fiscal policy to refer to changes in taxes or spending that are the result of deliber-
ate changes in government policy.
Government Purchases (G), Net Taxes (T), and Disposable
Income (Yd)
We now add the government to the simple economy in Chapter 23. To keep things simple, we will
combine two government activities—the collection of taxes and the payment of transfer
payments—into a category we call net taxes (T ). Specifically, net taxes are equal to the tax pay-
ments made to the government by firms and households minus transfer payments made to
households by the government. The other variable we will consider is government purchases of
goods and services (G).
Our earlier discussions of household consumption did not take taxes into account. We
assumed that all the income generated in the economy was spent or saved by households.
When we take into account the role of government, as Figure 24.1 does, we see that as income
(Y) flows toward households, the government takes income from households in the form of net
taxes (T). The income that ultimately gets to households is called disposable, or after-tax,
income (Yd):

Total income
minus net taxes: Y - T.
Yd K Y - T
disposable income K total income - net taxes
Yd excludes taxes paid by households and includes transfer payments made to households by the
government. For now, we are assuming that T does not depend on Y—that is, net taxes do not
depend on income. This assumption is relaxed in Appendix B to this chapter. Taxes that do not
depend on income are sometimes called lump-sum taxes.
As Figure 24.1 shows, the disposable income (Yd) of households must end up as either con-
sumption (C) or saving (S). Thus,
Yd  C + S
This equation is an identity—something that is always true.
Because disposable income is aggregate income (Y) minus net taxes (T), we can write
another identity:
Y - T  C + S

Adding Net Taxes 
(T) and Government
Purchases (G) to the
Circular Flow of Income
By adding T to both sides:
Y  C + S + T
This identity says that aggregate income gets cut into three pieces. Government takes a slice (net
taxes, T), and then households divide the rest between consumption (C) and saving (S).
Because governments spend money on goods and services, we need to expand our definition
of planned aggregate expenditure. Planned aggregate expenditure (AE) is the sum of consump-
tion spending by households (C), planned investment by business firms (I), and government
purchases of goods and services (G).
AE  C + I + G
A government’s budget deficit is the difference between what it spends (G) and what it col-
lects in taxes (T) in a given period:
budget deficit  G - T
If G exceeds T, the government must borrow from the public to finance the deficit. It does so
by selling Treasury bonds and bills (more on this later). In this case, a part of household saving
(S) goes to the government. The dashed lines in Figure 24.1 mean that some S goes to firms to
finance investment projects and some goes to the government to finance its deficit. If G is less
than T, which means that the government is spending less than it is collecting in taxes, the
government is running a surplus. A budget surplus is simply a negative budget deficit.
Adding Taxes to the Consumption Function
In Chapter 23, we assumed that
aggregate consumption (C) depends on aggregate income (Y), and for the sake of illustration, we
used a specific linear consumption function:
C = a + bY
budget deficit
The difference
between what a government
spends and what it collects in
taxes in a given period: G - T.

480
PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
where b is the marginal propensity to consume. We need to modify this consumption function
because we have added government to the economy. With taxes a part of the picture, it makes sense
to assume that disposable income (Yd), instead of before-tax income (Y), determines consumption
behavior. If you earn a million dollars but have to pay $950,000 in taxes, you have no more dispos-
able income than someone who earns only $50,000 but pays no taxes. What you have available for
spending on current consumption is your disposable income, not your before-tax income.
To modify our aggregate consumption function to incorporate disposable income instead of
before-tax income, instead of C = a + bY, we write
C = a + bYd
or
C = a + b(Y - T)
Our consumption function now has consumption depending on disposable income instead of
before-tax income.
Planned Investment
What about planned investment? The government can affect invest-
ment behavior through its tax treatment of depreciation and other tax policies. Investment may
also vary with economic conditions and interest rates, as we will see later. For our present pur-
poses, however, we continue to assume that planned investment (I) is fixed.
The Determination of Equilibrium Output (Income) 
We know from Chapter 23 that equilibrium occurs where Y = AE—that is, where aggregate output
equals planned aggregate expenditure. Remember that planned aggregate expenditure in an
economy with a government is AE  C + I + G, so equilibrium is
1 As we pointed out earlier, the government does not have complete control over tax revenues and transfer payments. We ignore
this problem here, however, and set T, tax revenues minus transfers, at a fixed amount. Things will become more realistic later in
this chapter and in Appendix B.
Y = C + I + G
The equilibrium analysis in Chapter 23 applies here also. If output (Y) exceeds planned aggregate
expenditure (C + I + G), there will be an unplanned increase in inventories—actual investment
will exceed planned investment. Conversely, if C + I + G exceeds Y, there will be an unplanned
decrease in inventories.
An example will illustrate the government’s effect on the macroeconomy and the equilib-
rium condition. First, our consumption function, C = 100 + .75Y before we introduced the gov-
ernment sector, now becomes
C = 100 + .75Yd
or
C = 100 + .75(Y - T)
Second, we assume that G is 100 and T is 100.1 In other words, the government is running a 
balanced budget, financing all of its spending with taxes. Third, we assume that planned invest-
ment (I) is 100.
Table 24.1 calculates planned aggregate expenditure at several levels of disposable income.
For example, at Y = 500, disposable income is Y - T, or 400. Therefore, C = 100 + .75(400) = 400.
Assuming that I is fixed at 100 and assuming that G is fixed at 100, planned aggregate expenditure
is 600 (C + I + G = 400 + 100 + 100). Because output (Y) is only 500, planned spending is greater
than output by 100. As a result, there is an unplanned inventory decrease of 100, giving firms an
incentive to raise output. Thus, output of 500 is below equilibrium.

CHAPTER 24
The Government and Fiscal Policy 481
If Y = 1,300, then Yd = 1,200, C = 1,000, and planned aggregate expenditure is 1,200. Here
planned spending is less than output, there will be an unplanned inventory increase of 100, and
firms have an incentive to cut back output. Thus, output of 1,300 is above equilibrium. Only
when output is 900 are output and planned aggregate expenditure equal, and only at Y = 900 does
equilibrium exist.
In Figure 24.2, we derive the same equilibrium level of output graphically. First, the consump-
tion function is drawn, taking into account net taxes of 100. The old function was C = 100 + .75Y.
The new function is C = 100 + .75(Y - T) or C = 100 + .75(Y - 100), rewritten as C = 100 + .75Y
- 75, or C = 25 + .75Y. For example, consumption at an income of zero is 25 (C = 25 + .75Y =
25 + .75(0) = 25). The marginal propensity to consume has not changed—we assume that it
remains .75. Note that the consumption function in Figure 24.2 plots the points in columns 1 and
4 of Table 24.1.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
Planned aggregate expenditure, recall, adds planned investment to consumption. Now in
addition to 100 in investment, we have government purchases of 100. Because I and G are con-
stant at 100 each at all levels of income, we add I + G = 200 to consumption at every level of
income. The result is the new AE curve. This curve is just a plot of the points in columns 1 and 8
of Table 24.1. The 45° line helps us find the equilibrium level of real output, which, we already
know, is 900. If you examine any level of output above or below 900, you will find disequilibrium.
Look, for example, at Y = 500 on the graph.At this level, planned aggregate expenditure is 600, but
output is only 500. Inventories will fall below what was planned, and firms will have an incentive
to increase output.
The Saving/Investment Approach to Equilibrium
As in the last chapter, we can
also examine equilibrium using the saving/investment approach. Look at the circular flow of
income in Figure 24.1. The government takes out net taxes (T) from the flow of income—a
leakage—and households save (S) some of their income—also a leakage from the flow of income.
The planned spending injections are government purchases (G) and planned investment (I). If
leakages (S + T) equal planned injections (I + G), there is equilibrium:
saving/investment approach to equilibrium: S + T = I + G
To derive this, we know that in equilibrium, aggregate output (income) (Y) equals planned aggre-
gate expenditure (AE). By definition, AE equals C + I + G, and by definition, Y equals C + S + T.
Therefore, at equilibrium
C + S + T = C + I + G
Subtracting C from both sides leaves:
S + T = I + G
Note that equilibrium does not require that G = T (a balanced government budget) or that S = I.
It is only necessary that the sum of S and T equals the sum of I and G.
Column 5 of Table 24.1 calculates aggregate saving by subtracting consumption from disposal
income at every level of disposable income (S  Yd - C). Because I and G are fixed, I + G equals
200 at every level of income. Using the table to add saving and taxes (S + T), we see that S + T
equals 200 only at Y = 900. Thus, the equilibrium level of output (income) is 900, the same
answer we arrived at through numerical and graphic analysis.
Fiscal Policy at Work: Multiplier Effects
You can see from Figure 24.2 that if the government were able to change the levels of either G or
T, it would be able to change the equilibrium level of output (income). At this point, we are
assuming that the government controls G and T. In this section, we will review three multipliers:
 Government spending multiplier
 Tax multiplier
 Balanced-budget multiplier
The Government Spending Multiplier
Suppose you are the chief economic adviser to the president and the economy is sitting at the
equilibrium output pictured in Figure 24.2. Output and income are 900, and the government is
currently buying 100 worth of goods and services each year and is financing them with 100 in
taxes. The budget is balanced. In addition, firms are investing (producing capital goods) 100. The
president calls you into the Oval Office and says, “Unemployment is too high. We need to lower
unemployment by increasing output and income.” After some research, you determine that an
acceptable unemployment rate can be achieved only if aggregate output increases to 1,100.

CHAPTER 24
The Government and Fiscal Policy 483
government spending multiplier K

MPS
You now need to determine how the government can use taxing and spending policy—
fiscal policy—to increase the equilibrium level of national output. Suppose the president has
let it be known that taxes must remain at present levels—Congress just passed a major tax
reform package—so adjusting T is out of the question for several years. That leaves you with
G. Your only option is to increase government spending while holding taxes constant.
To increase spending without raising taxes (which provides the government with revenue to
spend), the government must borrow. When G is bigger than T, the government runs a deficit
and the difference between G and T must be borrowed. For the moment, we will ignore the pos-
sible effect of the deficit and focus only on the effect of a higher G with T constant.
Meanwhile, the president is awaiting your answer. How much of an increase in spending
would be required to generate an increase of 200 in the equilibrium level of output, pushing it
from 900 to 1,100 and reducing unemployment to the president’s acceptable level? You might be
tempted to say that because we need to increase income by 200 (1,100 - 900), we should increase
government spending by the same amount—but what will happen? The increased government
spending will throw the economy out of equilibrium. Because G is a component of aggregate
spending, planned aggregate expenditure will increase by 200. Planned spending will be greater
than output, inventories will be lower than planned, and firms will have an incentive to increase
output. Suppose output rises by the desired 200.You might think,“We increased spending by 200
and output by 200, so equilibrium is restored.”
There is more to the story than this. The moment output rises, the economy is generating
more income. This was the desired effect: the creation of more employment. The newly employed
workers are also consumers, and some of their income gets spent. With higher consumption
spending, planned spending will be greater than output, inventories will be lower than planned,
and firms will raise output (and thus raise income) again. This time firms are responding to the
new consumption spending. Already, total income is over 1,100.
This story should sound familiar. It is the multiplier in action. Although this time it is gov-
ernment spending (G) that is changed rather than planned investment (I), the effect is the same
as the multiplier effect we described in Chapter 23. An increase in government spending has the
same impact on the equilibrium level of output and income as an increase in planned invest-
ment. A dollar of extra spending from either G or I is identical with respect to its impact on equi-
librium output. The equation for the government spending multiplier is the same as the equation
for the multiplier for a change in planned investment.
We derive the government spending multiplier algebraically in Appendix A to this chapter.
Formally, the government spending multiplier is defined as the ratio of the change in the
equilibrium level of output to a change in government spending. This is the same definition we
used in the previous chapter, but now the autonomous variable is government spending instead
of planned investment.
Remember that we were thinking of increasing government spending (G) by 200. We can use
the multiplier analysis to see what the new equilibrium level of Y would be for an increase in G of
200. The multiplier in our example is 4. (Because b—the MPC—is .75, the MPS must be 1 - .75
= .25; and 1/.25 = 4.) Thus, Y will increase by 800 (4  200). Because the initial level of Y was 900,
the new equilibrium level of Y is 900 + 800 = 1,700 when G is increased by 200.
The level of 1,700 is much larger than the level of 1,100 that we calculated as being neces-
sary to lower unemployment to the desired level. Let us back up then. If we want Y to increase by
200 and if the multiplier is 4, we need G to increase by only 200/4 = 50. If G changes by 50, the
equilibrium level of Y will change by 200 and the new value of Y will be 1,100 (900 + 200),
as desired.
Looking at Table 24.2, we can check our answer to make sure it is an equilibrium. Look first
at the old equilibrium of 900. When government purchases (G) were 100, aggregate output
(income) was equal to planned aggregate expenditure (AE  C + I + G) at Y = 900. Now G has
increased to 150. At Y = 900, (C + I + G) is greater than Y, there is an unplanned fall in invento-
ries, and output will rise, but by how much? The multiplier told us that equilibrium income

The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
would rise by four times the 50 change in G. Y should rise by 4  50 = 200, from 900 to 1,100,
before equilibrium is restored. Let us check. If Y = 1,100, consumption is C = 100 + .75Yd
= 100 + .75(1,000) = 850. Because I equals 100 and G now equals 100 (the original level of G) +
50 (the additional G brought about by the fiscal policy change) = 150, C + I + G = 850 + 100 +
150 = 1,100. Y = AE, and the economy is in equilibrium.
The graphic solution to the president’s problem is presented in Figure 24.3. An increase of 50
in G shifts the planned aggregate expenditure function up by 50. The new equilibrium income
occurs where the new AE line (AE2) crosses the 45° line, at Y = 1,100.
The Tax Multiplier
Remember that fiscal policy comprises policies concerning government spending and policies
concerning taxation. To see what effect a change in tax policy has on the economy, imagine the
following. You are still chief economic adviser to the president, but now you are instructed to
devise a plan to reduce unemployment to an acceptable level without increasing the level of gov-
ernment spending. In your plan, instead of increasing government spending (G), you decide to

The Government and Fiscal Policy 485
tax multiplier
The ratio of
change in the equilibrium level
of output to a change in taxes.
cut taxes and maintain the current level of spending. A tax cut increases disposable income,
which is likely to lead to added consumption spending. (Remember our general rule that
increased income leads to increased consumption.) Would the decrease in taxes affect aggregate
output (income) the same as an increase in G?
A decrease in taxes would increase income. The government spends no less than it did before
the tax cut, and households find that they have a larger after-tax (or disposable) income than they
had before. This leads to an increase in consumption. Planned aggregate expenditure will
increase, which will lead to inventories being lower than planned, which will lead to a rise in out-
put. When output rises, more workers will be employed and more income will be generated,
causing a second-round increase in consumption, and so on. Thus, income will increase by a
multiple of the decrease in taxes, but there is a “wrinkle.” The multiplier for a change in taxes is
not the same as the multiplier for a change in government spending. Why does the tax
multiplier—the ratio of change in the equilibrium level of output to a change in taxes—differ
from the spending multiplier? To answer that question, we need to compare the ways in which a
tax cut and a spending increase work their way through the economy.
Look at Figure 24.1 on p. 479. When the government increases spending, there is an immedi-
ate and direct impact on the economy’s total spending. Because G is a component of planned
aggregate expenditure, an increase in G leads to a dollar-for-dollar increase in planned aggregate
expenditure. When taxes are cut, there is no direct impact on spending. Taxes enter the picture
only because they have an effect on the household’s disposable income, which influences house-
hold’s consumption (which is part of total spending). As Figure 24.1 shows, the tax cut flows
through households before affecting aggregate expenditure.
Let us assume that the government decides to cut taxes by $1. By how much would spending
increase? We already know the answer. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) tells us how
much consumption spending changes when disposable income changes. In the example running
through this chapter, the marginal propensity to consume out of disposable income is .75. This
means that if households’ after-tax incomes rise by $1.00, they will increase their consumption
not by the full $1.00, but by only $0.75.2
In summary, when government spending increases by $1, planned aggregate expenditure
increases initially by the full amount of the rise in G, or $1. When taxes are cut, however, the ini-
tial increase in planned aggregate expenditure is only the MPC times the change in taxes. Because
the initial increase in planned aggregate expenditure is smaller for a tax cut than for a government
spending increase, the final effect on the equilibrium level of income will be smaller.
We figure the size of the tax multiplier in the same way we derived the multiplier for an
increase in investment and an increase in government purchases. The final change in the equilib-
rium level of output (income) (Y) is
Because the initial change in aggregate expenditure caused by a tax change of T is (-T 
MPC), we can solve for the tax multiplier by substitution:
Because a tax cut will cause an increase in consumption expenditures and output and a tax
increase will cause a reduction in consumption expenditures and output, the tax multiplier is a
negative multiplier:

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
If the MPC is .75, as in our example, the multiplier is -.75/.25 = -3. A tax cut of 100 will
increase the equilibrium level of output by -100  -3 = 300. This is very different from the effect
of our government spending multiplier of 4. Under those same conditions, a 100 increase in G
will increase the equilibrium level of output by 400 (100  4).
The Balanced-Budget Multiplier
We have now discussed (1) changing government spending with no change in taxes and (2)
changing taxes with no change in government spending. What if government spending and taxes
are increased by the same amount? That is, what if the government decides to pay for its extra
spending by increasing taxes by the same amount? The government’s budget deficit would not
change because the increase in expenditures would be matched by an increase in tax income.
You might think in this case that equal increases in government spending and taxes have no
effect on equilibrium income. After all, the extra government spending equals the extra amount
of tax revenues collected by the government. This is not so. Take, for example, a government
spending increase of $40 billion. We know from the preceding analysis that an increase in G of 40,
with taxes (T) held constant, should increase the equilibrium level of income by 40  the govern-
ment spending multiplier. The multiplier is 1/MPS or 1/.25 = 4. The equilibrium level of income
should rise by 160 (40  4).
Now suppose that instead of keeping tax revenues constant, we finance the 40 increase in
government spending with an equal increase in taxes so as to maintain a balanced budget. What
happens to aggregate spending as a result of the rise in G and the rise in T? There are two initial
effects. First, government spending rises by 40. This effect is direct, immediate, and positive. Now
the government also collects 40 more in taxes. The tax increase has a negative impact on overall
spending in the economy, but it does not fully offset the increase in government spending.
The final impact of a tax increase on aggregate expenditure depends on how households
respond to it. The only thing we know about household behavior so far is that households spend
75 percent of their added income and save 25 percent. We know that when disposable income
falls, both consumption and saving are reduced. A tax increase of 40 reduces disposable income
by 40, and that means consumption falls by 40  MPC. Because MPC = .75, consumption falls by
30 (40  .75). The net result in the beginning is that government spending rises by 40 and con-
sumption spending falls by 30.Aggregate expenditure increases by 10 right after the simultaneous
balanced-budget increases in G and T.
So a balanced-budget increase in G and T will raise output, but by how much? How large is
this balanced-budget multiplier? The answer may surprise you:
balanced-budget multiplier
The ratio of change in the
equilibrium level of output to a
change in government spending
where the change in government
spending is balanced by a change
in taxes so as not to create any
deficit. The balanced-budget
multiplier is equal to 1: The
change in Y resulting from 
the change in G and the equal
change in T are exactly the same
size as the initial change in 
G or T.
balanced-budget multiplier  1
Let us combine what we know about the tax multiplier and the government spending multiplier to
explain this.To find the final effect of a simultaneous increase in government spending and increase in
net taxes, we need to add the multiplier effects of the two. The government spending multiplier is
1/MPS. The tax multiplier is -MPC/MPS. Their sum is (1/MPS) + (-MPC/MPS)  (1 - MPC)/MPS.
Because MPC + MPS  1,1 - MPC  MPS.This means that (1 - MPC)/MPS  MPS/MPS  1.(We
also derive the balanced-budget multiplier in Appendix A to this chapter.)
Returning to our example, recall that by using the government spending multiplier, a 40
increase in G would raise output at equilibrium by 160 (40  the government spending multi-
plier of 4). By using the tax multiplier, we know that a tax hike of 40 will reduce the equilibrium
level of output by 120 (40  the tax multiplier, -3). The net effect is 160 minus 120, or 40. It
should be clear then that the effect on equilibrium Y is equal to the balanced increase in G and T.
In other words, the net increase in the equilibrium level of Y resulting from the change in G and
the change in T are exactly the size of the initial change in G or T.
If the president wanted to raise Y by 200 without increasing the deficit, a simultaneous
increase in G and T of 200 would do it. To see why, look at the numbers in Table 24.3. In Table 24.1,
we saw an equilibrium level of output at 900. With both G and T up by 200, the new equilibrium is
1,100—higher by 200.At no other level of Y do we find (C + I + G) = Y.An increase in government
spending has a direct initial effect on planned aggregate expenditure; a tax increase does not. The

CHAPTER 24
The Government and Fiscal Policy 487
initial effect of the tax increase is that households cut consumption by the MPC times the change
in taxes. This change in consumption is less than the change in taxes because the MPC is less than
1. The positive stimulus from the government spending increase is thus greater than the negative
stimulus from the tax increase. The net effect is that the balanced-budget multiplier is 1.
Table 24.4 summarizes everything we have said about fiscal policy multipliers.

A Warning
Although we have added government, the story told about the multiplier is still
incomplete and oversimplified. For example, we have been treating net taxes (T) as a lump-sum,
fixed amount, whereas in practice, taxes depend on income. Appendix B to this chapter shows
that the size of the multiplier is reduced when we make the more realistic assumption that taxes
depend on income. We continue to add more realism and difficulty to our analysis in the chapters
that follow.
The Federal Budget
Because fiscal policy is the manipulation of items in the federal budget, we need to consider those
aspects of the budget relevant to our study of macroeconomics. The federal budget is an enor-
mously complicated document, up to thousands of pages each year. It lists in detail all the things
the government plans to spend money on and all the sources of government revenues for the
coming year. It is the product of a complex interplay of social, political, and economic forces.
The “budget” is really three different budgets. First, it is a political document that dispenses
favors to certain groups or regions (the elderly benefit from Social Security, farmers from agricul-
tural price supports, students from federal loan programs, and so on) and places burdens (taxes)
on others. Second, it is a reflection of goals the government wants to achieve. For example, in addition
to assisting farmers,agricultural price supports are meant to preserve the “family farm.”Tax breaks for

corporations engaging in research and development of new products are meant to encourage research.
Finally, the budget may be an embodiment of some beliefs about how (if at all) the government should
manage the macroeconomy. The macroeconomic aspects of the budget are only a part of a more com-
plicated story, a story that may be of more concern to political scientists than to economists.
The Budget in 2009
A highly condensed version of the federal budget is shown in Table 24.5. In 2009, the government
had total receipts of $2,224.9 billion, largely from personal income taxes ($828.7 billion) and
contributions for social insurance ($949.1 billion). (Contributions for social insurance are
employer and employee Social Security taxes.) Receipts from corporate income taxes accounted
for $231.0 billion, or only 10.4 percent of total receipts. Not everyone is aware of the fact that cor-
porate income taxes as a percentage of government receipts are quite small relative to personal
income taxes and Social Security taxes.

3 Remember that there is an important difference between transfer payments and government purchases of goods and services
(consumption expenditures). Much of the government budget goes for things that an economist would classify as transfers (pay-
ments that are grants or gifts) instead of purchases of goods and services. Only the latter are included in our variable G.
Transfers are counted as part of net taxes.

The federal government also spent $3,451.3 billion in expenditures in 2009. Of this,
$1,596.1 billion represented transfer payments to persons (Social Security benefits, military
retirement benefits, and unemployment compensation).3 Consumption ($986.4 billion) was the
next-largest component, followed by grants-in-aid to state and local governments ($476.6 bil-
lion), which are grants given to the state and local governments by the federal government, and
interest payments on the federal debt ($272.3 billion).
The difference between the federal government’s receipts and its expenditures is the
federal surplus (+) or deficit (–), which is federal government saving. Table 24.5 shows 
that the federal government spent much more than it took in during 2009, resulting in a deficit
of $1,226.4 billion.

CHAPTER 24
The Government and Fiscal Policy 489
Fiscal Policy Since 1993: The Clinton, Bush, and Obama
Administrations
Between 1993 and the current edition of this text, the United States has had three different presi-
dents, two Democrats and a Republican. The fiscal policy implemented by each president reflects
both the political philosophy of the administration and the differing economic conditions each
faced. Figures 24.4, 24.5, and 24.6 trace the fiscal policies of the Clinton (1993–2000), Bush
(2001–2008), and Obama administrations (2009–2010 I).4
Figure 24.4 plots total federal personal income taxes as a percentage of total taxable income.This is
a graph of the average personal income tax rate.As the figure shows, the average tax rate increased sub-
stantially during the Clinton administrations.Much of this increase was due to a tax bill that was passed
in 1993 during the first Clinton administration. The figure then shows the dramatic effects of the tax
cuts during the first Bush administration. The large fall in the average tax rate in 2001 III was due to a
tax rebate passed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Although the average tax rate went back up in 2001 IV,
it then fell substantially as the Bush tax cuts began to be felt. The average tax rate remained low during
the first five quarters of the Obama administration.This was in part due to the large ($787 billion) stim-
ulus bill that was passed in February 2009. The bill consisted of tax cuts and government spending
increases,mostly for the 2009–2010 period.The overall tax policy of the federal government is thus clear
from Figure 24.4.The average tax rate rose sharply under President Clinton,fell sharply under President
Bush, and remained low under President Obama.
Table 24.5 on page 488 shows that the three most important spending variables of the federal
government are consumption expenditures, transfer payments to persons, and grants-in-aid to
state and local governments. Consumption expenditures, which are government expenditures on
goods and services, are part of GDP. Transfer payments and grants-in-aid are not spending on
current output (GDP), but just transfers from the federal government to people and state and
local governments. Figure 24.5 plots two spending ratios. One is federal government consump-
tion expenditures as a percentage of GDP, and the other is transfer payments to persons plus
grants-in-aid to state and local governments as a percentage of GDP. The figure shows that con-
sumption expenditures as a percentage of GDP generally fell during the Clinton administrations,
generally rose during the Bush administrations, and continued to rise during the Obama admin-
istration. The increase during the Bush administrations reflects primarily the spending on the
Iraq war. The increase during the Obama administration reflects the effects of the stimulus bill
and increased spending for the Afghanistan war. Figure 24.5 also shows that transfer payments as
a percentage of GDP generally rose during the Bush administrations and remained high in the

Obama administration. The figure was flat or slightly falling during the Clinton administrations.
Some of the fall between 1996 and 2000 was due to President Clinton’s welfare reform legislation.
Some of the rise from 2001 on is due to increased Medicare payments. The high values in the
Obama administration again reflect the effects of the stimulus bill.
Figure 24.6 plots the federal government surplus (+) or deficit (–1) as a percentage of GDP
for the 1993 I–2010 I period. The figure shows that during the Clinton administrations the fed-
eral budget moved from substantial deficit to noticeable surplus. This, of course, should not be
surprising since the average tax rate generally rose during this period and spending as a percent-
age of GDP generally fell. Figure 24.6 then shows that the surplus turned into a substantial
deficit during the first Bush administration. This also should not be surprising since the average

tax rate generally fell during this period and spending as a percentage of GDP generally rose.
The deficit rose sharply in the first five quarters of the Obama administration—to 9 percent of
GDP by the second quarter of 2009. Again, this is not a surprise. The average tax rate remained
low and spending increased substantially.
To summarize, Figures 24.4, 24.5, and 24.6 show clearly the large differences in the fiscal
policies of the three administrations. Tax rates generally rose and spending as a percentage of
GDP generally fell during the Clinton administrations, and the opposite generally happened dur-
ing the Bush and Obama administrations.
As you look at these differences, you should remember that the decisions that governments
make about levels of spending and taxes reflect not only macroeconomic concerns but also
microeconomic issues and political philosophy. President Clinton’s welfare reform program
resulted in a decrease in government transfer payments but was motivated in part by interest in
improving market incentives. President Bush’s early tax cuts were based less on macro-
economic concerns than on political philosophy, while the increased spending came from
international relations. President Obama’s fiscal policy during the first five quarters of his
administration, on the other hand, was motivated by macroeconomic concerns. The stimu-
lus bill was designed to mitigate the effects of the recession that began in 2008. Whether tax
and spending policies are motivated by macroeconomic concerns or not, they have macro-
economic consequences.
The Federal Government Debt
When the government runs a deficit, it must borrow to finance it. To borrow, the federal gov-
ernment sells government securities to the public. It issues pieces of paper promising to pay a
certain amount, with interest, in the future. In return, it receives funds from the buyers of the
paper and uses these funds to pay its bills. This borrowing increases the federal debt, the total
amount owed by the federal government. The federal debt is the total of all accumulated
deficits minus surpluses over time. Conversely, if the government runs a surplus, the federal
debt falls.
The federal government debt (privately held) as a percentage of GDP is plotted in Figure 24.7
for the 1993 I–2010 I period. The percentage fell during the second Clinton administration, when
the budget was in surplus, and it mostly rose during the Bush administrations, when the budget
was in deficit. It continued to rise during the Obama administration.

Some of the securities that the government issues end up being held by the federal govern-
ment at the Federal Reserve or in government trust funds, the largest of which is Social Security.
The term privately held federal debt refers only to the privately held debt of the U.S. govern-
ment. On July 1, 2010, the federal debt was $13.2 trillion, of which $8.6 trillion was privately held.
The Economy’s Influence on the
Government Budget
We have just seen that an administration’s fiscal policy is sometimes affected by the state of the
economy. The Obama administration, for example, increased government spending and lowered
taxes in response to the recession of 2008–2009. It is also the case, however, that the economy affects
the federal government budget even if there are no explicit fiscal policy changes. There are effects
that the government has no direct control over. They can be lumped under the general heading of
“automatic stabilizers and destabilizers.”
Automatic Stabilizers and Destabilizers
Most of the tax revenues of the government result from applying a tax rate decided by the gov-
ernment to a base that reflects the underlying activity of the economy. The corporate profits tax,
for example, comes from applying a rate (say 35 percent) to the profits earned by firms. Income
taxes come from applying rates shown in tax tables to income earned by individuals. Tax rev-
enues thus depend on the state of the economy even when the government does not change tax
rates. When the economy goes into a recession, tax revenues will fall, even if rates remain con-
stant, and when the economy picks up, so will tax revenues. As a result, deficits fall in expansions
and rise in recessions, other things being equal.
Some items on the expenditure side of the government budget also automatically change as
the economy changes. If the economy declines, unemployment increases, which leads to an
increase in unemployment benefits. Welfare payments, food stamp allotments, and similar trans-
fer payments also increase in recessions and decrease in expansions.
These automatic changes in government revenues and expenditures are called automatic
stabilizers. They help stabilize the economy. In recessions taxes fall and expenditures rise, which
create positive effects on the economy, and in expansions the opposite happens. The government
does not have to change any laws for this to happen.
Another reason that government spending is not completely controllable is that inflation
often picks up in an expansion. We saw in Chapter 22 that some government transfer payments
are tied to the rate of inflation (changes in the CPI); so these transfer payments increase as
inflation increases. Some medical care transfer payments also increase as the prices of medical
care rise, and these prices may be affected by the overall rate of inflation. To the extent that
inflation is more likely to increase in an expansion than in a recession, inflation can be consid-
ered to be an automatic destabilizer. Government spending increases as inflation increases,
which further fuels the expansion, which is destabilizing. If inflation decreases in a recession,
there is an automatic decrease in government spending, which makes the recession worse.
We will see in later chapters that interest rates tend to rise in expansions and fall in reces-
sions. When interest rates rise, government interest payments to households and firms increase
(because households and firms hold much of the government debt), which is interest income to
the households and firms. Government spending on interest payments thus tends to rise in
expansions and fall in contractions, which, other things being equal, is destabilizing. We will see
in later chapters, however, that interest rates also have negative effects on the economy, and these
negative effects are generally larger than the positive effects from the increase in government
interest payments. The net effect of an increase in interest rates on the economy is thus generally
negative. But this is getting ahead of our story.
Since 1982 personal income tax brackets have been tied to the overall price level. Prior to this
they were not, which led to what was called fiscal drag. This is now of only historical interest, but it
is useful to see what it was. It is simple to explain. If tax brackets are fixed, then as people’s incomes
rise, they move into higher brackets; so the average tax rates that they pay increase. This is a “drag”on
the economy, hence the name fiscal drag. It is interesting to note that fiscal drag is actually an

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Governments Disagree on How Much More Spending Is Needed
Thus far in describing the workings of the macroeconomy 
we have focused on the United States. But, as we pointed out in
Chapter 1 and you saw vividly in the Economics in Practice in the exam-
ples of the iPod and the Barbie doll, the U.S. economy is intertwined
with the rest of the world. For that reason, U.S. government leaders are
concerned not only with their own fiscal policies but also with those of
other governments (and vice versa).
The article below describes a June 2010 summit of the G-20, a
group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers from around
the world, focused on is fiscal policy. As the article describes, there
was considerable debate among these finance ministers about just
how aggressive fiscal policy should be in 2010 and 2011, with
President Obama among the strongest advocates of additional
stimulus by governments.
Spending Fight at G-20
The Wall Street Journal
The U.S. plans to press its economic partners at a summit to
move cautiously with plans to tighten their fiscal policies
while the global economic recovery remains uncertain, for
fear of producing a “Hoover moment.”
President Barack Obama, worried the fragile world econ-
omy could slip back into recession—as it did in the 1930s dur-
ing the Hoover administration—plans to urge his counterparts
at this weekend’s Group of 20 meeting to continue some level
of stimulative spending, among other policies, as a way of
sustaining economic growth. But at precisely the same time,
politicians around the world are starting to embrace a new-
found desire for fiscal austerity.
European leaders are more cautious about spending,
chastened by the example of Greece, where investor confi-
dence was shattered by mounting debt and the possibility of
a default, prompting a nearly $1 trillion rescue fund.
In China, officials worry that continued stimulus could
create unsustainable asset bubbles. Indeed, one reason
China may have pledged Saturday to allow the value of its
currency some flexibility is to resist inflation by making
imports less costly, economists speculate.
A tilt toward austerity is under way in Japan too, which
has run up giant debts over the past two decades to shake
the country out of its economic doldrums. Prime minister
Naoto Kan, who took office June 8, wants to double the
country’s broad sales tax from the current 5% within several
years and cap next year’s national budget at this year’s level.
“Fiscal policy which relies excessively on deficit bond
issuance is no longer sustainable,” he said in his inaugural
speech, citing the example of Greece.
Obama economists argue that if the rate of government
spending declines too quickly, demand could shrivel, under-
mine growth and threaten a second recession. They infor-
mally call the issue a “Hoover moment,” a loose reference to
premature fiscal tightening in the 1930s by Presidents
Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt that is blamed for
prolonging the Depression.

automatic stabilizer in that tax revenue rises in expansions and falls in contractions. By indexing the
tax brackets to the overall price level,the legislation in 1982 eliminated the fiscal drag caused by infla-
tion. If incomes rise only because of inflation, there is no change in average tax rates because the
brackets are changed each year. The inflation part of the automatic stabilizer has been eliminated.
Full-Employment Budget
Because the condition of the economy affects the budget deficit so strongly, we cannot accurately
judge either the intent or the success of fiscal policies just by looking at the surplus or deficit.
Instead of looking simply at the size of the surplus or deficit, economists have developed an alter-
native way to measure how effective fiscal policy actually is. By examining what the budget would
be like if the economy were producing at the full-employment level of output—the so-called
full-employment budget—we can establish a benchmark for evaluating fiscal policy.
The distinction between the actual and full-employment budget is important. Suppose the
economy is in a slump and the deficit is $250 billion. Also suppose that if there were full

employment, the deficit would fall to $75 billion. The $75 billion deficit that would remain
even with full employment would be due to the structure of tax and spending programs
instead of the state of the economy. This deficit—the deficit that remains at full employment—
is sometimes called the structural deficit. The $175 billion ($250 billion - $75 billion) part of
the deficit caused by the fact the economy is in a slump is known as the cyclical deficit. The
existence of the cyclical deficit depends on where the economy is in the business cycle, and it
ceases to exist when full employment is reached. By definition, the cyclical deficit of the full-
employment budget is zero.
Table 24.5 on p. 488 shows that the federal government deficit in 2009 was $1.2 trillion. How
much of this was cyclical and how much was structural? The U.S. economy was in recession in
2009, and so some of the deficit was clearly cyclical. Most estimates at the time, however, were that
over half of the $1.2 trillion was structural, and there was much debate in the summer of 2010 as
to when and how the structural deficit was to be reduced. See the Economics in Practice on p. 493.
Looking Ahead
We have now seen how households, firms, and the government interact in the goods market, how
equilibrium output (income) is determined, and how the government uses fiscal policy to influ-
ence the economy. In the following two chapters, we analyze the money market and monetary
policy—the government’s other major tool for influencing the economy.
494
PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
1. The government can affect the macroeconomy through two
specific policy channels. Fiscal policy refers to the govern-
ment’s taxing and spending behavior. Discretionary fiscal
policy refers to changes in taxes or spending that are the
result of deliberate changes in government policy. Monetary
policy refers to the behavior of the Federal Reserve concern-
ing the nation’s money supply.
GOVERNMENT IN THE ECONOMY p. 478
2. The government does not have complete control over tax
revenues and certain expenditures, which are partially dic-
tated by the state of the economy.
3. As a participant in the economy, the government makes pur-
chases of goods and services (G), collects taxes, and makes
transfer payments to households. Net taxes (T) is equal to
the tax payments made to the government by firms and
households minus transfer payments made to households by
the government.
4. Disposable, or after-tax, income (Yd) is equal to the amount of
income received by households after taxes: Yd  Y - T. After-
tax income determines households’ consumption behavior.
5. The budget deficit is equal to the difference between what the
government spends and what it collects in taxes: G - T.
When G exceeds T, the government must borrow from the
public to finance its deficit.
6. In an economy in which government is a participant,
planned aggregate expenditure equals consumption
spending by households (C) plus planned investment
spending by firms (I) plus government spending on goods
and services (G): AE  C + I + G. Because the condition
Y = AE is necessary for the economy to be in equilibrium,
it follows that Y = C + I + G is the macroeconomic equi-
librium condition. The economy is also in equilibrium
when leakages out of the system equal injections into the
system. This occurs when saving and net taxes (the leak-
ages) equal planned investment and government pur-
chases (the injections): S + T = I + G.
FISCAL POLICY AT WORK: MULTIPLIER EFFECTS p. 482 
7. Fiscal policy has a multiplier effect on the economy. A
change in government spending gives rise to a multiplier
equal to 1/MPS. A change in taxation brings about a
multiplier equal to -MPC/MPS. A simultaneous equal
increase or decrease in government spending and taxes 
has a multiplier effect of 1.
THE FEDERAL BUDGET p. 487 
8. During the two Clinton administrations, the federal
budget went from being in deficit to being in surplus.
This was reversed during the two Bush administrations,
driven by tax rate decreases and government spending
increases. The deficit has increased further in the 
Obama administration.

example, during expansions, the government automati-

10. The full-employment budget is an economist’s construction
of what the federal budget would be if the economy were
producing at a full-employment level of output. The

employment. A cyclical deficit occurs when there is a down-
turn in the business cycle.

1. You are appointed secretary of the treasury of a recently indepen-
dent country called Rugaria. The currency of Rugaria is the lav.
The new nation began fiscal operations this year, and the budget
situation is that the government will spend 10 million lavs and
taxes will be 9 million lavs. The 1-million-lav difference will be
borrowed from the public by selling 10-year government bonds
paying 5 percent interest. The interest on the outstanding bonds
must be added to spending each year, and we assume that addi-
tional taxes are raised to cover that interest. Assuming that the
budget stays the same except for the interest on the debt for 
10 years, what will be the accumulated debt? What will the size 
of the budget be after 10 years?
2. Suppose that the government of Lumpland is enjoying a fat
budget surplus with fixed government expenditures of
G = 150 and fixed taxes of T = 200. Assume that consumers 
of Lumpland behave as described in the following consump-
tion function:
C = 150 + 0.75(Y - T)
Suppose further that investment spending is fixed at 100. Calculate
the equilibrium level of GDP in Lumpland. Solve for equilibrium
levels of Y, C, and S. Next, assume that the Republican Congress in
Lumpland succeeds in reducing taxes by 20 to a new fixed level of
180. Recalculate the equilibrium level of GDP using the tax multi-
plier. Solve for equilibrium levels of Y, C, and S after the tax cut
and check to ensure that the multiplier worked. What arguments
are likely to be used in support of such a tax cut? What arguments
might be used to oppose such a tax cut?

Assume that households consume 80 percent of their income,
they save 20 percent of their income, MPC = .8, and MPS = .2.
That is, C = .8Yd and S = .2Yd.
a. Is the economy of Nurd in equilibrium? What is Nurd’s

coming months if the government takes no action?
b. If $200 is the “full-employment” level of Y, what fiscal policy

d. Suppose Y = $200, C = $160, S = $40, and I = $40. Is Nurd’s
economy in equilibrium?
e. Starting with the situation in part d, suppose the govern-

continues to spend $30 every period. If I remains constant,
what will happen to the equilibrium level of Nurd’s domes-
tic product (Y)? What will the new levels of C and S be?
f. Starting with the situation in part d, suppose the govern-
ment starts taxing the population $30 each year without
spending anything and continues to tax at that rate every
period. If I remains constant, what will happen to the equi-

the new levels of C and S? How does your answer to part f
differ from your answer to part e? Why?

federal government’s debt as a percentage of GDP in 1946?
How large is it today?

income) and all spending and transfer programs are fixed (in
the sense that they do not depend on the state of the economy,
as, for example, unemployment benefits now do). In this case,
would there be any automatic stabilizers in the government

15. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 493] At a June 2010
summit of the G-20, President Obama urged member nations to
continue stimulus spending to maintain economic growth.
Obama successfully argued the same case at a summit in 2009,
resulting in increased fiscal spending by the G-20 in both 2009
and 2010, but attitudes had changed by the June 2010 summit as
many members were weighing fiscal austerity measures to coun-
teract the previous spending increases. Do some research on the
G-20 nations to see what happened to fiscal spending in these
nations in 2011. In which nations did fiscal spending increase
and in which did it decrease? What happened to the unemploy-
ment rates and GDP levels in these nations in 2011? Do you see
any correlation between the change in fiscal spending and the
changes in unemployment rates and GDP? Explain.
Y = $200
G = $0

b. If no changes were made, at what level of GDP (Y) would the
economy of Yuk settle?
c. Some local conservatives blame Yuk’s problems on the size of
the government sector. They suggest cutting government
purchases by 25 billion Yuks. What effect would such cuts
have on the economy? (Be specific.)
6. A $1 increase in government spending will raise equilibrium
income more than a $1 tax cut will, yet both have the same
impact on the budget deficit. So if we care about the budget
deficit, the best way to stimulate the economy is through
increases in spending, not cuts in taxes. Comment.

CHAPTER 24
The Government and Fiscal Policy 497
CHAPTER 24 APPENDIX A
Deriving the Fiscal Policy Multipliers
The Government Spending and Tax
Multipliers
In the chapter, we noted that the government spending multi-
plier is 1/MPS. (This is the same as the investment multiplier.)
We can also derive the multiplier algebraically using our hypo-
thetical consumption function:
C = a + b(Y - T)
where b is the marginal propensity to consume. As you know,
the equilibrium condition is
Y = C + I + G
By substituting for C, we get
This equation can be rearranged to yield
Now solve for Y by dividing through by (1 - b):
We see from this last equation that if G increases by 1 with
the other determinants of Y (a, I, and T) remaining constant,
Y increases by 1/(1 - b). The multiplier is, as before, simply
1/(1 - b), where b is the marginal propensity to consume. Of
course, 1 - b equals the marginal propensity to save, so the
government spending multiplier is 1/MPS.
We can also derive the tax multiplier. The last equation
says that when T increases by $1, holding a, I, and G constant,
income decreases by b/(1 - b) dollars. The tax multiplier is 
-b/(1 - b), or -MPC/(1 - MPC) = -MPC/MPS. (Remember,
the negative sign in the resulting tax multiplier shows that it is
a negative multiplier.)
Y =
1
(1 - b) (a + I + G - bT)
Y(1 - b) = a + I + G - bT
Y - bY = a + I + G - bT
Y = a + bY - bT + I + G
Y = a + b(Y - T) + I + G
The Balanced-Budget Multiplier
It is easy to show formally that the balanced-budget multiplier
= 1. When taxes and government spending are simultaneously
increased by the same amount, there are two effects on
planned aggregate expenditure: one positive and one negative.
The initial impact of a balanced-budget increase in govern-
ment spending and taxes on aggregate expenditure would be
the increase in government purchases (G) minus the decrease
in consumption (C) caused by the tax increase. The decrease
in consumption brought about by the tax increase is equal to
C = T (MPC).

CHAPTER 24 APPENDIX B
The Case in Which Tax Revenues
Depend on Income
In this chapter, we used the simplifying assumption that the
government collects taxes in a lump sum. This made our dis-
cussion of the multiplier effects somewhat easier to follow.
Now suppose that the government collects taxes not solely as a
lump sum that is paid regardless of income but also partly in
the form of a proportional levy against income. This is a more
realistic assumption. Typically, tax collections either are based
on income (as with the personal income tax) or follow the ups
and downs in the economy (as with sales taxes).Instead of setting
taxes equal to some fixed amount, let us say that tax revenues
depend on income. If we call the amount of net taxes collected
T, we can write T = T0 + tY.
In a balanced-budget increase, G = T; so we can substitute:
net initial increase in spending:
G - G(MPC) = G (1 - MPC)
Because MPS = (1 - MPC), the net initial increase in spend-
ing is:
G(MPS)
We can now apply the expenditure multiplier 
to this
net initial increase in spending:
Thus, the final total increase in the equilibrium level of Y is 
just equal to the initial balanced increase in G and T. That
means the balanced-budget multiplier = 1, so the final
increase in real output is of the same magnitude as the initial
change in spending.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
This equation contains two parts. First, we note that net
taxes (T) will be equal to an amount T0 if income (Y) is zero.
Second, the tax rate (t) indicates how much net taxes change as
income changes. Suppose T0 is equal to -200 and t is 1/3. The
resulting tax function is T = -200 + 1/3Y, which is graphed in
Figure 24B.1. Note that when income is zero, the government
collects “negative net taxes,” which simply means that it makes
transfer payments of 200. As income rises, tax collections
increase because every extra dollar of income generates $0.33
in extra revenues for the government.
How do we incorporate this new tax function into our dis-
cussion? All we do is replace the old value of T (in the example
in the chapter, T was set equal to 100) with the new value, -200
+ 1/3Y. Look first at the consumption equation. Consumption
(C) still depends on disposable income, as it did before. Also,
disposable income is still Y - T, or income minus taxes. Instead
of disposable income equaling Y - 100, however, the new equa-
tion for disposable income is
Because consumption still depends on after-tax income,
exactly as it did before, we have
Nothing else needs to be changed. We solve for equilibrium
income exactly as before, by setting planned aggregate expen-
diture equal to aggregate output. Recall that planned aggregate

expenditure is C + I + G and aggregate output is Y. If we
assume, as before, that I = 100 and G = 100, the equilibrium is
This equation may look difficult to solve, but it is not. It sim-
plifies to
This means that Y = 450/.5 = 900, the new equilibrium level
of income.
Consider the graphic analysis of this equation as shown in
Figure 24B.2, where you should note that when we make taxes
a function of income (instead of a lump-sum amount), the AE
function becomes flatter than it was before. Why? When tax
collections do not depend on income, an increase in income of
$1 means disposable income also increases by a dollar. Because
taxes are a constant amount, adding more income does not
raise the amount of taxes paid. Disposable income therefore
changes dollar for dollar with any change in income.
When taxes depend on income, a $1 increase in income does
not increase disposable income by a full dollar because some of
the additional dollar goes to pay extra taxes. Under the modified
tax function of Figure 24B.2, an extra dollar of income will
increase disposable income by only $0.67 because $0.33 of the
extra dollar goes to the government in the form of taxes.

When taxes are strictly lump-sum (T = 100) and do not depend on
income, the aggregate expenditure function is steeper than when taxes
depend on income.

CHAPTER 24
The Government and Fiscal Policy 499
No matter how taxes are calculated,the marginal propensity
to consume out of disposable (or after-tax) income is the
same—each extra dollar of disposable income will increase con-
sumption spending by $0.75. However, a $1 change in before-tax
income does not have the same effect on disposable income in
each case. Suppose we were to increase income by $1. With the
lump-sum tax function, disposable income would rise by $1.00,
and consumption would increase by the MPC times the change
in Yd, or $0.75. When taxes depend on income, disposable
income would rise by only $0.67 from the $1.00 increase in
income and consumption would rise by only the MPC times the
change in disposable income, or $0.75  .67 = $0.50.
If a $1.00 increase in income raises expenditure by $0.75
in one case and by only $0.50 in the other, the second aggregate
expenditure function must be flatter than the first.
The Government Spending and Tax
Multipliers Algebraically
All this means that if taxes are a function of income, the three
multipliers (investment, government spending, and tax) are
less than they would be if taxes were a lump-sum amount. By
using the same linear consumption function we used in
Chapters 22 and 23, we can derive the multiplier:
C = a + bY - bT0 - btY
C = a + b(Y - T0 - tY)
C = a + b(Y - T)
We know that Y = C + I + G. Through substitution we get
Solving for Y:
This means that a $1 increase in G or I (holding a and T0 con-
stant) will increase the equilibrium level of Y by
If b = MPC = .75 and t = .20, the spending multiplier is 2.5.
(Compare this to 4, which would be the value of the spending
multiplier if taxes were a lump sum, that is, if t = 0.)
Holding a, I, and G constant, a fixed or lump-sum tax cut
(a cut in T0) will increase the equilibrium level of income by
Thus, if b = MPC = .75 and t = .20, the tax multiplier is -1.875.
(Compare this to -3, which would be the value of the tax mul-
tiplier if taxes were a lump sum.)

CHAPTER OUTLINE
501
The Money Supply
and the Federal
Reserve System
In the last two chapters, we explored
how consumers, firms, and the gov-
ernment interact in the goods mar-
ket. In this chapter and the next, we
show how money markets work in
the macroeconomy. We begin with
what money is and what role it plays
in the U.S. economy. We then dis-
cuss the forces that determine the
supply of money and show how
banks create money. Finally, we dis-
cuss the workings of the nation’s
central bank, the Federal Reserve
(the Fed), and the tools at its dis-
posal to control the money supply.
Microeconomics has little to say about money. Microeconomic theories and models are con-
cerned primarily with real quantities (apples, oranges, hours of labor) and relative prices (the
price of apples relative to the price of oranges or the price of labor relative to the prices of other
goods). Most of the key ideas in microeconomics do not require that we know anything about
money. As we shall see, this is not the case in macroeconomics.
An Overview of Money
You often hear people say things like,“He makes a lot of money” (in other words,“He has a high
income”) or “She’s worth a lot of money” (meaning “She is very wealthy”). It is true that your
employer uses money to pay you your income, and your wealth may be accumulated in the form
of money. However, money is not income, and money is not wealth.
To see that money and income are not the same, think of a $20 bill. That bill may pass through a
thousand hands in a year, yet never be used to pay anyone a salary. Suppose you get a $20 bill from an
automatic teller machine,and you spend it on dinner.The restaurant puts that $20 bill in a bank in the
next day’s deposit. The bank gives it to a woman cashing a check the following day; she spends it at a
baseball game that night. The bill has been through many hands but not as part of anyone’s income.
What Is Money?
Most people take the ability to obtain and use money for granted. When the whole monetary sys-
tem works well, as it generally does in the United States, the basic mechanics of the system are vir-
tually invisible. People take for granted that they can walk into any store, restaurant, boutique, or
gas station and buy whatever they want as long as they have enough green pieces of paper.
The idea that you can buy things with money is so natural and obvious that it seems absurd
to mention it, but stop and ask yourself: “How is it that a store owner is willing to part with a
steak and a loaf of bread that I can eat in exchange for some pieces of paper that are intrinsically
worthless?”Why, on the other hand, are there times and places where it takes a shopping cart full
of money to purchase a dozen eggs? The answers to these questions lie in what money is—a
means of payment, a store of value, and a unit of account.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
A Means of Payment, or Medium of Exchange
Money is vital to the working of a
market economy. Imagine what life would be like without it. The alternative to a monetary econ-
omy is barter, people exchanging goods and services for other goods and services directly instead
of exchanging via the medium of money.
How does a barter system work? Suppose you want bacon, eggs, and orange juice for break-
fast. Instead of going to the store and buying these things with money, you would have to find
someone who has the items and is willing to trade them. You would also have to have something
the bacon seller, the orange juice purveyor, and the egg vendor want. Having pencils to trade will
do you no good if the bacon, orange juice, and egg sellers do not want pencils.
A barter system requires a double coincidence of wants for trade to take place. That is, to effect
a trade, you have to find someone who has what you want and that person must also want what
you have. Where the range of goods traded is small, as it is in relatively unsophisticated
economies, it is not difficult to find someone to trade with and barter is often used. In a complex
society with many goods, barter exchanges involve an intolerable amount of effort. Imagine try-
ing to find people who offer for sale all the things you buy in a typical trip to the supermarket and
who are willing to accept goods that you have to offer in exchange for their goods.
Some agreed-to medium of exchange (or means of payment) neatly eliminates the dou-
ble-coincidence-of-wants problem. Under a monetary system, money is exchanged for goods or
services when people buy things; goods or services are exchanged for money when people sell
things. No one ever has to trade goods for other goods directly. Money is a lubricant in the func-
tioning of a market economy.
A Store of Value
Economists have identified other roles for money aside from its primary
function as a medium of exchange.Money also serves as a store of value—an asset that can be used to
transport purchasing power from one time period to another. If you raise chickens and at the end of
the month sell them for more than you want to spend and consume immediately, you may keep some
of your earnings in the form of money until the time you want to spend it.
There are many other stores of value besides money. You could have decided to hold your
“surplus” earnings by buying such things as antique paintings, baseball cards, or diamonds, which
you could sell later when you want to spend your earnings. Money has several advantages over
these other stores of value. First, it comes in convenient denominations and is easily portable. You
do not have to worry about making change for a Renoir painting to buy a gallon of gasoline.
Second, because money is also a means of payment, it is easily exchanged for goods at all times. (A
Renoir is not easily exchanged for other goods.) These two factors compose the liquidity property
of money. Money is easily spent, flowing out of your hands like liquid. Renoirs and ancient Aztec
statues are neither convenient nor portable and are not readily accepted as a means of payment.
The main disadvantage of money as a store of value is that the value of money falls when
the prices of goods and services rise. If the price of potato chips rises from $1 per bag to $2 per
bag, the value of a dollar bill in terms of potato chips falls from one bag to half a bag. When this
happens, it may be better to use potato chips (or antiques or real estate) as a store of value.
A Unit of Account
Money also serves as a unit of account—a consistent way of quoting prices.
All prices are quoted in monetary units. A textbook is quoted as costing $90, not 150 bananas or
5 DVDs,and a banana is quoted as costing 60 cents,not 1.4 apples or 6 pages of a textbook.Obviously,
a standard unit of account is extremely useful when quoting prices. This function of money may have
escaped your notice—what else would people quote prices in except money?
Commodity and Fiat Monies
Introductory economics textbooks are full of stories about the various items that have been used
as money by various cultures—candy bars, cigarettes (in World War II prisoner-of-war camps),
huge wheels of carved stone (on the island of Yap in the South Pacific), cowrie shells (in West
Africa), beads (among North American Indians), cattle (in southern Africa), and small green
scraps of paper (in contemporary North America). The list goes on. These various kinds of
money are generally divided into two groups, commodity monies and fiat money.
Commodity monies are those items used as money that also have an intrinsic value in some
other use. For example, prisoners of war made purchases with cigarettes, quoted prices in terms
of cigarettes, and held their wealth in the form of accumulated cigarettes. Of course, cigarettes

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Dolphin Teeth as Currency
In most countries commodity monies are not used anymore,
but the world is a big place and there are exceptions. The fol-
lowing article discusses the use of dolphin teeth as currency in
the Solomon Islands. Dolphin teeth are being used as a means
of payment and a store of value. Note that even with a currency
like dolphin teeth there is a concern about counterfeit currency,
namely fruit-bat teeth. Tooth decay is also a problem.
Shrinking Dollar Meets Its Match In
Dolphin Teeth
Wall Street Journal
HONIARA, Solomon Islands—Forget the euro and the yen. In
this South Pacific archipelago, people are pouring their savings
into another appreciating currency: dolphin teeth.
Shaped like miniature ivory jalapeños, the teeth of spinner
dolphins have facilitated commerce in parts of the Solomon
Islands for centuries. This traditional currency is gaining in
prominence now after years of ethnic strife that have under-
mined the country’s economy and rekindled attachment to
ancient customs.
Over the past year, one spinner tooth has soared in price
to about two Solomon Islands dollars (26 U.S. cents), from as
little as 50 Solomon Islands cents. The offi cial currency,
pegged to a global currency basket dominated by the U.S.
dollar, has remained relatively stable in the period.
Even Rick Houenipwela, the governor of the Central Bank
of the Solomon Islands, says he is an investor in teeth, having
purchased a “huge amount” a few years ago. “Dolphin teeth
are like gold,” Mr. Houenipwela says. “You keep them as a
store of wealth—just as if you’d put money in the bank.”
Few Solomon Islanders share Western humane sensibilities
about the dolphins. Hundreds of animals are killed at a time in
regular hunts, usually off the large island of Malaita. Dolphin
flesh provides protein for the villagers. The teeth are used like
cash to buy local produce.
Fifty teeth will purchase a pig;
a handful are enough for
some yams and cassava.
The tradition has deep
roots. Dolphin teeth and
other animal products were
used as currency in the
Solomon Islands and other
parts of Melanesia long
before European colonizers
arrived here in the late nine-
teenth century.
An exhibit of traditional
money in the central bank’s
lobby displays the now-
worthless garlands of dog teeth. Curled pig tusks have
played a similar role in the neighboring nation of Vanuatu and
parts of Papua New Guinea. Whale, rather than dolphin, teeth
were collected in Fiji. While the use of these traditional curren-
cies is dying off elsewhere in the region, there is no sign of the
boom in dolphin teeth abating here. Mr. Houenipwela, the
central bank governor, says that some entrepreneurs have
recently asked him for permission to establish a bank that
would take deposits in teeth.
A dolphin-tooth bank with clean, insect-free vaults would
solve the problem of tooth decay under inappropriate stor-
age conditions, and would also deter counterfeiters who
pass off fruit-bat teeth, which resemble dolphin teeth, for the
genuine article. Mr. Houenipwela, however, says he had to
turn down the request because only institutions accepting
conventional currencies can call themselves banks under
Solomon Islands law.

could also be smoked—they had an alternative use apart from serving as money. Gold represents
another form of commodity money. For hundreds of years gold could be used directly to buy
things, but it also had other uses, ranging from jewelry to dental fillings.
By contrast, money in the United States today is mostly fiat money. Fiat money, sometimes
called token money, is money that is intrinsically worthless. The actual value of a 1-, 10-, or 
50-dollar bill is basically zero; what other uses are there for a small piece of paper with some
green ink on it?
Why would anyone accept worthless scraps of paper as money instead of something that has
some value, such as gold, cigarettes, or cattle? If your answer is “because the paper money is
backed by gold or silver,” you are wrong. There was a time when dollar bills were convertible
directly into gold. The government backed each dollar bill in circulation by holding a certain
amount of gold in its vaults. If the price of gold were $35 per ounce, for example, the government
agreed to sell 1 ounce of gold for 35 dollar bills. However, dollar bills are no longer backed by any
commodity—gold, silver, or anything else. They are exchangeable only for dimes, nickels, pennies,
other dollars, and so on.
The public accepts paper money as a means of payment and a store of value because the govern-
ment has taken steps to ensure that its money is accepted. The government declares its paper money

to be legal tender. That is, the government declares that its money must be accepted in settlement of
debts. It does this by fiat (hence fiat money). It passes laws defining certain pieces of paper printed in
certain inks on certain plates to be legal tender,and that is that.Printed on every Federal Reserve note
in the United States is “This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.” Often the govern-
ment can get a start on gaining acceptance for its paper money by requiring that it be used to pay
taxes. (Note that you cannot use chickens, baseball cards, or Renoir paintings to pay your taxes.)
Aside from declaring its currency legal tender, the government usually does one other thing to
ensure that paper money will be accepted: It promises the public that it will not print paper money so
fast that it loses its value.Expanding the supply of currency so rapidly that it loses much of its value has
been a problem throughout history and is known as currency debasement. Debasement of the cur-
rency has been a special problem of governments that lack the strength to take the politically unpopu-
lar step of raising taxes. Printing money to be used on government expenditures of goods and services
can serve as a substitute for tax increases, and weak governments have often relied on the printing
press to finance their expenditures. A recent example is Zimbabwe. In 2007, faced with a need to
improve the public water system, Zimbabwe’s president, Robert Mugabe, said “Where money for pro-
jects cannot be found, we will print it”(reported in the Washington Post, July 29, 2007). In later chap-
ters we will see the way in which this strategy for funding public projects can lead to serious inflation.
Measuring the Supply of Money in the United States
We now turn to the various kinds of money in the United States. Recall that money is used to buy
things (a means of payment), to hold wealth (a store of value), and to quote prices (a unit of
account). Unfortunately, these characteristics apply to a broad range of assets in the U.S. econ-
omy in addition to dollar bills. As we will see, it is not at all clear where we should draw the line
and say,“Up to this is money, beyond this is something else.”
To solve the problem of multiple monies, economists have given different names to different
measures of money. The two most common measures of money are transactions money, also
called M1, and broad money, also called M2.
M1: Transactions Money
What should be counted as money? Coins and dollar bills, as
well as higher denominations of currency, must be counted as money—they fit all the requirements.
What about checking accounts? Checks, too, can be used to buy things and can serve as a store of
value. Debit cards provide even easier access to funds in checking accounts. In fact, bankers call
checking accounts demand deposits because depositors have the right to cash in (demand) their entire
checking account balance at any time. That makes your checking account balance virtually equiva-
lent to bills in your wallet, and it should be included as part of the amount of money you hold.
If we take the value of all currency (including coins) held outside of bank vaults and add to
it the value of all demand deposits, traveler’s checks, and other checkable deposits, we have
defined M1, or transactions money. As its name suggests, this is the money that can be directly
used for transactions—to buy things.

 M1 K currency held outside banks + demand deposits + traveler’s checks
M1 at the end of May 2010 was $1,705.6 billion. M1 is a stock measure—it is measured at a
point in time. It is the total amount of coins and currency outside of banks and the total dollar
amount in checking accounts on a specific day. Until now, we have considered supply as a flow—
a variable with a time dimension: the quantity of wheat supplied per year, the quantity of auto-
mobiles supplied to the market per year, and so on. However, M1 is a stock variable.
M2: Broad Money
Although M1 is the most widely used measure of the money supply,
there are others. Should savings accounts be considered money? Many of these accounts cannot
be used for transactions directly, but it is easy to convert them into cash or to transfer funds from
a savings account into a checking account. What about money market accounts (which allow
only a few checks per month but pay market-determined interest rates) and money market
mutual funds (which sell shares and use the proceeds to purchase short-term securities)? These
can be used to write checks and make purchases, although only over a certain amount.
legal tender

government has required to be
accepted in settlement of debts.

M2 at the end of May 2010 was $8,560.5 billion, considerably larger than the total M1 of
$1,705.6 billion. The main advantage of looking at M2 instead of M1 is that M2 is sometimes more
stable. For instance, when banks introduced new forms of interest-bearing checking accounts in
the early 1980s, M1 shot up as people switched their funds from savings accounts to checking
accounts. However, M2 remained fairly constant because the fall in savings account deposits and
the rise in checking account balances were both part of M2, canceling each other out.
Beyond M2
Because a wide variety of financial instruments bear some resemblance to
money, some economists have advocated including almost all of them as part of the money
supply. In recent years, for example, credit cards have come to be used extensively in exchange.
Everyone who has a credit card has a credit limit—you can charge only a certain amount on
your card before you have to pay it off. Usually we pay our credit card bills with a check. One of
the very broad definitions of money includes the amount of available credit on credit cards
(your charge limit minus what you have charged but not paid) as part of the money supply.
There are no rules for deciding what is and is not money. This poses problems for economists
and those in charge of economic policy. However, for our purposes, “money” will always refer to
transactions money, or M1. For simplicity, we will say that M1 is the sum of two general categories:
currency in circulation and deposits. Keep in mind, however, that M1 has four specific components:
currency held outside banks, demand deposits, traveler’s checks, and other checkable deposits.
The Private Banking System
Most of the money in the United States today is “bank money”of one sort or another. M1 is made
up largely of checking account balances instead of currency, and currency makes up an even
smaller part of M2 and other broader definitions of money. Any understanding of money
requires some knowledge of the structure of the private banking system.
Banks and banklike institutions borrow from individuals or firms with excess funds and lend
to those who need funds. For example, commercial banks receive funds in various forms, including
deposits in checking and savings accounts. They take these funds and loan them out in the form of
car loans, mortgages, commercial loans, and so on. Banks and banklike institutions are called
financial intermediaries because they “mediate,”or act as a link between people who have funds to
lend and those who need to borrow.
The main types of financial intermediaries are commercial banks, followed by savings and loan
associations, life insurance companies, and pension funds. Since about 1970, the legal distinctions
among the different types of financial intermediaries have narrowed considerably. It used to be, for
example, that checking accounts could be held only in commercial banks and that commercial
banks could not pay interest on checking accounts. Savings and loan associations were prohibited
from offering certain kinds of deposits and were restricted primarily to making loans for mortgages.
The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, enacted by Congress
in 1980, eliminated many of the previous restrictions on the behavior of financial institutions.
Many types of institutions now offer checking accounts, and interest is paid on many types of
checking accounts. Savings and loan associations now make loans for many things besides
home mortgages.
How Banks Create Money
So far we have described the general way that money works and the way the supply of money is
measured in the United States, but how much money is available at a given time? Who supplies it,
and how does it get supplied? We are now ready to analyze these questions in detail. In particular,
we want to explore a process that many find mysterious: the way banks create money.
If we add near monies, close substitutes for transactions money, to M1, we get M2, called
broad money because it includes not-quite-money monies such as savings accounts, money
market accounts, and other near monies.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
A Historical Perspective: Goldsmiths
To begin to see how banks create money,consider the origins of the modern banking system.In the fif-
teenth and sixteenth centuries, citizens of many lands used gold as money, particularly for large trans-
actions. Because gold is both inconvenient to carry around and susceptible to theft, people began to
place their gold with goldsmiths for safekeeping. On receiving the gold, a goldsmith would issue a
receipt to the depositor, charging him a small fee for looking after his gold.After a time, these receipts
themselves, rather than the gold that they represented, began to be traded for goods. The receipts
became a form of paper money, making it unnecessary to go to the goldsmith to withdraw gold for a
transaction.The receipts of the de Medici’s,who were both art patrons and goldsmith-bankers in Italy
in the Renaissance period, were reputedly accepted in wide areas of Europe as currency.
At this point, all the receipts issued by goldsmiths were backed 100 percent by gold. If a gold-
smith had 100 ounces of gold in his safe, he would issue receipts for 100 ounces of gold, and no
more. Goldsmiths functioned as warehouses where people stored gold for safekeeping. The gold-
smiths found, however, that people did not come often to withdraw gold. Why should they, when
paper receipts that could easily be converted to gold were “as good as gold”? (In fact, receipts were
better than gold—more portable, safer from theft, and so on.) As a result, goldsmiths had a large
stock of gold continuously on hand.
Because they had what amounted to “extra” gold sitting around, goldsmiths gradually realized
that they could lend out some of this gold without any fear of running out of gold.Why would they
do this? Because instead of just keeping their gold idly in their vaults, they could earn interest on
loans. Something subtle, but dramatic, happened at this point. The goldsmiths changed from mere
depositories for gold into banklike institutions that had the power to create money. This transfor-
mation occurred as soon as goldsmiths began making loans. Without adding any more real gold to
the system, the goldsmiths increased the amount of money in circulation by creating additional
claims to gold—that is, receipts that entitled the bearer to receive a certain number of ounces of
gold on demand.1 Thus, there were more claims than there were ounces of gold.
A detailed example may help to clarify this. Suppose you go to a goldsmith who is function-
ing only as a depository, or warehouse, and ask for a loan to buy a plot of land that costs
20 ounces of gold. Also suppose that the goldsmith has 100 ounces of gold on deposit in his safe
and receipts for exactly 100 ounces of gold out to the various people who deposited the gold. If
the goldsmith decides he is tired of being a mere goldsmith and wants to become a real bank, he
will loan you some gold. You don’t want the gold itself, of course; rather, you want a slip of paper
that represents 20 ounces of gold. The goldsmith in essence “creates”money for you by giving you
a receipt for 20 ounces of gold (even though his entire supply of gold already belongs to various
other people).2 When he does, there will be receipts for 120 ounces of gold in circulation instead
of the 100 ounces worth of receipts before your loan and the supply of money will have increased.
People think the creation of money is mysterious. Far from it! The creation of money is sim-
ply an accounting procedure, among the most mundane of human endeavors. You may suspect
the whole process is fundamentally unsound or somehow dubious. After all, the banking system
began when someone issued claims for gold that already belonged to someone else. Here you may
be on slightly firmer ground.
Goldsmiths-turned-bankers did face certain problems. Once they started making loans, their
receipts outstanding (claims on gold) were greater than the amount of gold they had in their
vaults at any given moment. If the owners of the 120 ounces worth of gold receipts all presented
their receipts and demanded their gold at the same time, the goldsmith would be in trouble. With
only 100 ounces of gold on hand, people could not get their gold at once.
In normal times, people would be happy to hold receipts instead of real gold, and this prob-
lem would never arise. If, however, people began to worry about the goldsmith’s financial safety,
they might begin to have doubts about whether their receipts really were as good as gold.
Knowing there were more receipts outstanding than there were ounces of gold in the goldsmith’s
vault, they might start to demand gold for receipts.
1 Remember, these receipts circulated as money, and people used them to make transactions without feeling the need to cash
them in—that is, to exchange them for gold itself.
2 In return for lending you the receipt for 20 ounces of gold, the goldsmith expects to get an IOU promising to repay the amount
(in gold itself or with a receipt from another goldsmith) with interest after a certain period of time.

CHAPTER 25
The Money Supply and the Federal Reserve System 507
This situation leads to a paradox. It makes perfect sense for people to hold paper receipts
(instead of gold) if they know they can always get gold for their paper. In normal times, gold-
smiths could feel perfectly safe in loaning out more gold than they actually had in their posses-
sion. But once people start to doubt the safety of the goldsmith, they are foolish not to demand
their gold back from the vault.
A run on a goldsmith (or in our day, a run on a bank) occurs when many people present their
claims at the same time. These runs tend to feed on themselves. If I see you going to the goldsmith
to withdraw your gold, I may become nervous and decide to withdraw my gold as well. It is the fear
of a run that usually causes the run. Runs on a bank can be triggered by a variety of causes: rumors
that an institution may have made loans to borrowers who cannot repay, wars, failures of other
institutions that have borrowed money from the bank, and so on.As you will see later in this chap-
ter, today’s bankers differ from goldsmiths—today’s banks are subject to a “required reserve ratio.”
Goldsmiths had no legal reserve requirements, although the amount they loaned out was subject
to the restriction imposed on them by their fear of running out of gold.
The Modern Banking System
To understand how the modern banking system works, you need to be familiar with some basic
principles of accounting. Once you are comfortable with the way banks keep their books, the
whole process of money creation will seem logical.
A Brief Review of Accounting
Central to accounting practices is the statement that “the
books always balance.” In practice, this means that if we take a snapshot of a firm—any firm,
including a bank—at a particular moment in time, then by definition:
Assets are things a firm owns that are worth something. For a bank, these assets include the
bank building, its furniture, its holdings of government securities, cash in its vaults, bonds,
stocks, and so on. Most important among a bank’s assets, for our purposes at least, are the loans
it has made. A borrower gives the bank an IOU, a promise to repay a certain sum of money on or
by a certain date. This promise is an asset of the bank because it is worth something. The bank
could (and sometimes does) sell the IOU to another bank for cash.
Other bank assets include cash on hand (sometimes called vault cash) and deposits with the
U.S. central bank—the Federal Reserve Bank (the Fed). As we will see later in this chapter, fed-
eral banking regulations require that banks keep a certain portion of their deposits on hand as
vault cash or on deposit with the Fed.
A firm’s liabilities are its debts—what it owes. A bank’s liabilities are the promises to pay, or
IOUs, that it has issued. A bank’s most important liabilities are its deposits. Deposits are debts
owed to the depositors because when you deposit money in your account, you are in essence
making a loan to the bank.
The basic rule of accounting says that if we add up a firm’s assets and then subtract the total
amount it owes to all those who have lent it funds, the difference is the firm’s net worth. Net worth
represents the value of the firm to its stockholders or owners. How much would you pay for a firm
that owns $200,000 worth of diamonds and had borrowed $150,000 from a bank to pay for them?
The firm is worth $50,000—the difference between what it owns and what it owes.If the price of dia-
monds were to fall, bringing their value down to only $150,000, the firm would be worth nothing.
We can keep track of a bank’s financial position using a simplified balance sheet called a
T-account. By convention, the bank’s assets are listed on the left side of the T-account and its liabil-
ities and net worth are on the right side. By definition, the balance sheet always balances, so that the
sum of the items on the left side of the T-account is equal to the sum of the items on the right side.
The T-account in Figure 25.1 shows a bank having $110 million in assets, of which $20 mil-
lion are reserves, the deposits the bank has made at the Fed, and its cash on hand (coins and cur-
rency). Reserves are an asset to the bank because it can go to the Fed and get cash for them, the

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
same way you can go to the bank and get cash for the amount in your savings account. Our bank’s
other asset is its loans, worth $90 million.
Why do banks hold reserves/deposits at the Fed? There are many reasons, but perhaps the
most important is the legal requirement that they hold a certain percentage of their deposit liabil-
ities as reserves. The percentage of its deposits that a bank must keep as reserves is known as the
required reserve ratio. If the reserve ratio is 20 percent, a bank with deposits of $100 million
must hold $20 million as reserves, either as cash or as deposits at the Fed. To simplify, we will
assume that banks hold all of their reserves in the form of deposits at the Fed.
On the liabilities side of the T-account, the bank has taken deposits of $100 million, so it
owes this amount to its depositors. This means that the bank has a net worth of $10 million
to its owners ($110 million in assets – $100 million in liabilities = $10 million net worth).
The net worth of the bank is what “balances” the balance sheet. Remember that when some
item on a bank’s balance sheet changes, there must be at least one other change somewhere
else to maintain balance. If a bank’s reserves increase by $1, one of the following must also be
true: (1) Its other assets (for example, loans) decrease by $1, (2) its liabilities (deposits)
increase by $1, or (3) its net worth increases by $1. Various fractional combinations of these
are also possible.
The Creation of Money
Like the goldsmiths, today’s bankers seek to earn income by lending money out at a higher inter-
est rate than they pay depositors for use of their money.
In modern times, the chances of a run on a bank are fairly small, and even if there is a run,
the central bank protects the private banks in various ways. Therefore, banks usually make loans
up to the point where they can no longer do so because of the reserve requirement restriction. A
bank’s required amount of reserves is equal to the required reserve ratio times the total deposits
in the bank. If a bank has deposits of $100 and the required ratio is 20 percent, the required
amount of reserves is $20. The difference between a bank’s actual reserves and its required
reserves is its excess reserves:

excess reserves K actual reserves - required reserves
If banks make loans up to the point where they can no longer do so because of the reserve
requirement restriction, this means that banks make loans up to the point where their excess
reserves are zero.
To see why, note that when a bank has excess reserves, it has credit available and it can make
loans. Actually, a bank can make loans only if it has excess reserves. When a bank makes a loan, it
creates a demand deposit for the borrower. This creation of a demand deposit causes the bank’s
excess reserves to fall because the extra deposits created by the loan use up some of the excess
reserves the bank has on hand. An example will help demonstrate this.
Assume that there is only one private bank in the country, the required reserve ratio is
20 percent, and the bank starts off with nothing, as shown in panel 1 of Figure 25.2. Now suppose
dollar bills are in circulation and someone deposits 100 of them in the bank. The bank deposits
the $100 with the central bank, so it now has $100 in reserves, as shown in panel 2. The bank now
has assets (reserves) of $100 and liabilities (deposits) of $100. If the required reserve ratio is
20 percent, the bank has excess reserves of $80.

CHAPTER 25
The Money Supply and the Federal Reserve System 509
How much can the bank lend and still meet the reserve requirement? For the moment, let us
assume that anyone who gets a loan keeps the entire proceeds in the bank or pays them to some-
one else who does. Nothing is withdrawn as cash. In this case, the bank can lend $400 and still meet
the reserve requirement. Panel 3 shows the balance sheet of the bank after completing the maxi-
mum amount of loans it is allowed with a 20 percent reserve ratio. With $80 of excess reserves, the
bank can have up to $400 of additional deposits. The $100 in reserves plus $400 in loans (which
are made as deposits) equals $500 in deposits.With $500 in deposits and a required reserve ratio of
20 percent, the bank must have reserves of $100 (20 percent of $500)—and it does. The bank can
lend no more than $400 because its reserve requirement must not exceed $100. When a bank has
no excess reserves and thus can make no more loans, it is said to be loaned up.
Remember, the money supply (M1) equals cash in circulation plus deposits. Before the initial
deposit, the money supply was $100 ($100 cash and no deposits). After the deposit and the loans,
the money supply is $500 (no cash outside bank vaults and $500 in deposits). It is clear then that
when loans are converted into deposits, the supply of money can change.
The bank whose T-accounts are presented in Figure 25.2 is allowed to make loans of $400
based on the assumption that loans that are made stay in the bank in the form of deposits. Now
suppose you borrow from the bank to buy a personal computer and you write a check to the com-
puter store. If the store also deposits its money in the bank, your check merely results in a reduc-
tion in your account balance and an increase to the store’s account balance within the bank. No
cash has left the bank. As long as the system is closed in this way—remember that so far we have
assumed that there is only one bank—the bank knows that it will never be called on to release any
of its $100 in reserves. It can expand its loans up to the point where its total deposits are $500.
Of course, there are many banks in the country, a situation that is depicted in Figure 25.3. As
long as the banking system as a whole is closed, it is still possible for an initial deposit of $100 to
result in an expansion of the money supply to $500, but more steps are involved when there is
more than one bank.
To see why,assume that Mary makes an initial deposit of $100 in bank 1 and the bank deposits the
entire $100 with the Fed (panel 1 of Figure 25.3).All loans that a bank makes are withdrawn from the
bank as the individual borrowers write checks to pay for merchandise.After Mary’s deposit,bank 1 can
make a loan of up to $80 to Bill because it needs to keep only $20 of its $100 deposit as reserves. (We
are assuming a 20 percent required reserve ratio.) In other words, bank 1 has $80 in excess reserves.
Bank 1’s balance sheet at the moment of the loan to Bill appears in panel 2 of Figure 25.3.
Bank 1 now has loans of $80. It has credited Bill’s account with the $80, so its total deposits are
$180 ($80 in loans plus $100 in reserves). Bill then writes a check for $80 for a set of shock
absorbers for his car. Bill wrote his check to Sam’s Car Shop, and Sam deposits Bill’s check in
bank 2. When the check clears, bank 1 transfers $80 in reserves to bank 2. Bank 1’s balance sheet
now looks like the top of panel 3. Its assets include reserves of $20 and loans of $80; its liabilities
are $100 in deposits. Both sides of the T-account balance: The bank’s reserves are 20 percent of its
deposits, as required by law, and it is fully loaned up.
Now look at bank 2. Because bank 1 has transferred $80 in reserves to bank 2, bank 2 now
has $80 in deposits and $80 in reserves (panel 1, bank 2). Its reserve requirement is also 20 per-
cent, so it has excess reserves of $64 on which it can make loans.
Now assume that bank 2 loans the $64 to Kate to pay for a textbook and Kate writes a check
for $64 payable to the Manhattan College Bookstore. The final position of bank 2, after it honors
Kate’s $64 check by transferring $64 in reserves to the bookstore’s bank, is reserves of $16, loans
of $64, and deposits of $80 (panel 3, bank 2).

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
The Manhattan College Bookstore deposits Kate’s check in its account with bank 3. Bank 3
now has excess reserves because it has added $64 to its reserves. With a reserve ratio of 20 percent,
bank 3 can loan out $51.20 (80 percent of $64, leaving 20 percent in required reserves to back the
$64 deposit).
As the process is repeated over and over, the total amount of deposits created is $500, the sum
of the deposits in each of the banks. Because the banking system can be looked on as one big bank,
the outcome here for many banks is the same as the outcome in Figure 25.2 for one bank.3
The Money Multiplier
In practice, the banking system is not completely closed—there is some leakage out of the system.
Still, the point here is that an increase in bank reserves leads to a greater than one-for-one
increase in the money supply. Economists call the relationship between the final change in
deposits and the change in reserves that caused this change the money multiplier. Stated some-
what differently, the money multiplier is the multiple by which deposits can increase for every
dollar increase in reserves. Do not confuse the money multiplier with the spending multipliers we
discussed in the last two chapters. They are not the same thing.
In the example we just examined, reserves increased by $100 when the $100 in cash was
deposited in a bank and the amount of deposits increased by $500 ($100 from the initial deposit,
$400 from the loans made by the various banks from their excess reserves). The money multiplier
in this case is $500/$100 = 5. Mathematically, the money multiplier can be defined as follows:4
money multiplier
The
multiple by which deposits can
increase for every dollar increase
in reserves; equal to 1 divided by
the required reserve ratio.
3 If banks create money when they make loans, does repaying a loan “destroy” money? The answer is yes.
4 To show this mathematically, let rr denote the reserve requirement ratio, like 0.20. Say someone deposits 100 in Bank 1 in Figure 25.3.
Bank 1 can create 100(1 – rr) in loans, which are then deposits in Bank 2. Bank 2 can create 100(1 – rr)(1 – rr) in loans, which are then
deposits in Bank 3, and so on. The sum of the deposits is thus 100[1 + (1 – rr) + (1 – rr)2 + (1 – rr)3 + …]. The sum of the infinite
series in brackets is 1/rr, which is the money multiplier.

 FIGURE 25.3 The Creation of Money When There Are Many Banks
In panel 1, there is an initial deposit of $100 in bank 1. In panel 2, bank 1 makes a loan of $80 by creating a
deposit of $80. A check for $80 by the borrower is then written on bank 1 (panel 3) and deposited in bank 2
(panel 1). The process continues with bank 2 making loans and so on. In the end, loans of $400 have been
made and the total level of deposits is $500.

CHAPTER 25
The Money Supply and the Federal Reserve System 511
In the United States, the required reserve ratio varies depending on the size of the bank and
the type of deposit. For large banks and for checking deposits, the ratio is currently 10 percent,
which makes the potential money multiplier 1/.10 = 10. This means that an increase in reserves
of $1 could cause an increase in deposits of $10 if there were no leakage out of the system.
It is important to remember that the money multiplier is derived under the assumption that
banks hold no excess reserves. For example, when Bank 1 gets the deposit of $100, it loans out the
maximum that it can, namely $100 times 1 minus the reserve requirement ratio. If instead Bank 1
held the $100 as excess reserves, the increase in the money supply would just be the initial $100 in
deposits (brought in, say, from outside the banking system).
The Federal Reserve System
We have seen how the private banking system creates money by making loans. However, pri-
vate banks are not free to create money at will. Their ability to create money is controlled by
the volume of reserves in the system, which is controlled by the Fed. The Fed therefore has
the ultimate control over the money supply. We will now examine the structure and function
of the Fed.
Founded in 1913 by an act of Congress (to which major reforms were added in the 1930s),
the Fed is the central bank of the United States. The Fed is a complicated institution with many
responsibilities, including the regulation and supervision of about 8,000 commercial banks. The
organization of the Federal Reserve System is presented in Figure 25.4.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
The Board of Governors is the most important group within the Federal Reserve System. The
board consists of seven members, each appointed for 14 years by the president of the United
States. The chair of the Fed, who is appointed by the president and whose term runs for 4 years,
usually dominates the entire Federal Reserve System and is sometimes said to be the second most
powerful person in the United States. The Fed is an independent agency in that it does not take
orders from the president or from Congress.
The United States is divided into 12 Federal Reserve districts, each with its own Federal
Reserve bank. These districts are indicated on the map in Figure 25.4. The district banks are like
branch offices of the Fed in that they carry out the rules, regulations, and functions of the central
system in their districts and report to the Board of Governors on local economic conditions.
U.S. monetary policy—the behavior of the Fed concerning the money supply—is formally
set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC consists of the seven mem-
bers of the Fed’s Board of Governors; the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank; and on
a rotating basis, four of the presidents of the 11 other district banks. The FOMC sets goals con-
cerning the money supply and interest rates, and it directs the Open Market Desk in the New
York Federal Reserve Bank to buy and/or sell government securities. (We discuss the specifics of
open market operations later in this chapter.)
Functions of the Federal Reserve
The Fed is the central bank of the United States. Central banks are sometimes known as “bankers’
banks”because only banks (and occasionally foreign governments) can have accounts in them.As
a private citizen, you cannot go to the nearest branch of the Fed and open a checking account or
apply to borrow money.
Although from a macroeconomic point of view the Fed’s crucial role is to control the money
supply, the Fed also performs several important functions for banks. These functions include
clearing interbank payments, regulating the banking system, and assisting banks in a difficult
financial position. The Fed is also responsible for managing exchange rates and the nation’s for-
eign exchange reserves.5 In addition, it is often involved in intercountry negotiations on interna-
tional economic issues.
Clearing interbank payments works as follows. Suppose you write a $100 check drawn on
your bank, the First Bank of Fresno (FBF), to pay for tulip bulbs from Crockett Importers of
Miami, Florida. Because Crockett Importers does not bank at FBF, but at Banco de Miami, how
does your money get from your bank to the bank in Florida? The Fed does it. Both FBF and
Banco de Miami have accounts at the Fed. When Crockett Importers receives your check and
deposits it at Banco de Miami, the bank submits the check to the Fed, asking it to collect the funds
from FBF. The Fed presents the check to FBF and is instructed to debit FBF’s account for the $100
and to credit the account of Banco de Miami. Accounts at the Fed count as reserves, so FBF loses
$100 in reserves, and Banco de Miami gains $100 in reserves. The two banks effectively have
traded ownerships of their deposits at the Fed. The total volume of reserves has not changed, nor
has the money supply.
This function of clearing interbank payments allows banks to shift money around virtually
instantaneously. All they need to do is wire the Fed and request a transfer, and the funds move at
the speed of electricity from one computer account to another.
Besides facilitating the transfer of funds among banks, the Fed is responsible for many of the
regulations governing banking practices and standards. For example, the Fed has the authority to
control mergers among banks, and it is responsible for examining banks to ensure that they are
financially sound and that they conform to a host of government accounting regulations. As we
saw earlier, the Fed also sets reserve requirements for all financial institutions.
An important responsibility of the Fed is to act as the lender of last resort for the banking
system. As our discussion of goldsmiths suggested, banks are subject to the possibility of runs on
their deposits. In the United States, most deposits of less than $100,000 are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a U.S. government agency that was established in 1933
during the Great Depression. Deposit insurance makes panics less likely. Because depositors

lender of last resort
One of the functions of the
Fed: It provides funds to
troubled banks that cannot
find any other sources of funds.
5 Foreign exchange reserves are holdings of the currencies of other countries—for example, Japanese yen—by the U.S. govern-
ment. We discuss exchange rates and foreign exchange markets at length in Chapter 35.

CHAPTER 25
The Money Supply and the Federal Reserve System 513
know they can always get their money, even if the bank fails, they are less likely to withdraw their
deposits. Not all deposits are insured, so the possibility of bank panics remains. However, the Fed
stands ready to provide funds to a troubled bank that cannot find any other sources of funds.
The Fed is the ideal lender of last resort for two reasons. First, providing funds to a bank
that is in dire straits is risky and not likely to be very profitable, and it is hard to find private
banks or other private institutions willing to do this. The Fed is a nonprofit institution whose
function is to serve the overall welfare of the public. Thus, the Fed would certainly be inter-
ested in preventing catastrophic banking panics such as those that occurred in the late 1920s
and the 1930s.
Second, the Fed has an essentially unlimited supply of funds with which to bail out banks
facing the possibility of runs. The reason, as we shall see, is that the Fed can create reserves at will.
A promise by the Fed that it will support a bank is very convincing. Unlike any other lender, the
Fed can never run out of money. Therefore, the explicit or implicit support of the Fed should be
enough to assure depositors that they are in no danger of losing their funds.
Expanded Fed Activities Beginning in 2008
In March 2008 the Fed began to make major policy changes. No longer could it be considered
only a lender of last resort. The U.S. economy entered a recession in 2008; in particular, the hous-
ing and mortgage markets were in trouble. The problem began in the 2003–2005 period with
rapidly rising housing prices—in what some called a housing “bubble.” Banks issued mortgages
to some people with poor credit ratings, so-called sub-prime borrowers, and encouraged other
people to take out mortgages they could not necessarily afford. There was very little regulation of
these activities—by the Fed or any other government agency—and investors took huge risks.
When housing prices began to fall in late 2005, the stage was set for a worldwide financial crisis,
which essentially began in 2008.
The Fed responded to these events in a number of ways. In March 2008 it participated in a bail-
out of Bear Stearns, a large financial institution, by guaranteeing $30 billion of Bear Stearns’ liabili-
ties to JPMorgan. On September 7, 2008, it participated in a government takeover of the Federal
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(Freddie Mac), which at that time owned or guaranteed about half of the $12 trillion mortgage
market in the United States. On September 17, 2008, the Fed loaned $85 billion to the American
International Group (AIG) insurance company to help it avoid bankruptcy. In mid September the
Fed urged Congress to pass a $700 billion bailout bill, which was signed into law on October 3.
In the process of bailing out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in September 2008, the Fed began
buying securities of these two associations, called “federal agency debt securities.”We will see in the
next section that by the end of June 2010 the Fed held $165 billion of these securities. More remark-
able, however, is that in January 2009 the Fed began buying mortgage-backed securities, securities
that the private sector was reluctant to hold because of their perceived riskiness. We will see in the
next section that by the end of June 2010 the Fed held a little over $1.1 trillion of these securities.
As is not surprising, there has been much political discussion of whether the Fed should have
regulated more in 2003–2005 and whether it should be intervening in the private sector as much
as it has been doing. Whatever one’s views, it is certainly the case that the Fed has taken a much
more active role in financial markets since 2008.
The Federal Reserve Balance Sheet
Although the Fed is a special bank, it is similar to an ordinary commercial bank in that it has a
balance sheet that records its asset and liability position at any moment of time. Among other
things, this balance sheet is useful for seeing the Fed’s current involvement in private financial
markets. The balance sheet for June 30, 2010, is presented in Table 25.1.
On June 30, 2010, the Fed had $2,373 billion in assets, of which $11 billion was gold, $777 bil-
lion was U.S. Treasury securities, $165 billion was federal agency debt securities, $1,118 billion
was mortgage-backed securities, and $302 billion was other.
Gold is trivial. Do not think that this gold has anything to do with the supply of money. Most of
the gold was acquired during the 1930s, when it was purchased from the U.S. Treasury
Department. Since 1934, the dollar has not been backed by (is not convertible into) gold. You
cannot take a dollar bill to the Fed to receive gold for it; all you can get for your old dollar bill is a

514
PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
new dollar bill.6 Although it is unrelated to the money supply, the Fed’s gold counts as an asset on
its balance sheet because it is something of value the Fed owns.
U.S. Treasury securities are the traditional assets held by the Fed. These are obligations of the
federal government that the Fed has purchased over the years. The Fed controls the money sup-
ply by buying and selling these securities, as we will see in the next section. Before the change in
Fed behavior in 2008, almost all of its assets were in the form of U.S. Treasury securities. For
example, in the ninth edition of this text, the balance sheet presented was for October 24, 2007,
where total Fed assets were $885 billion, of which $780 billion were U.S. Treasury securities.
The new assets of the Fed (since 2008) are federal agency debt securities and mortgage-
backed securities. (These were both zero in the October 24, 2007 balance sheet.) They total more
than half of the total assets of the Fed. The Fed’s intervention discussed at the end of the previous
section has been huge.
Of the Fed’s liabilities, $945 billion is currency in circulation, $970 billion is reserve balances,
$288 billion is U.S. Treasury deposits, and $170 billion is other. Regarding U.S. Treasury deposits,
the Fed acts as a bank for the U.S. government and these deposits are held by the U.S. government
at the Fed. When the government needs to pay for something like a new aircraft carrier, it may
write a check to the supplier of the ship drawn on its “checking account” at the Fed. Similarly,
when the government receives revenues from tax collections, fines, or sales of government assets,
it may deposit these funds at the Fed.
Currency in circulation accounts for about 40 percent of the Fed’s liabilities. The dollar bill
that you use to buy a pack of gum is clearly an asset from your point of view—it is something you
own that has value. Because every financial asset is by definition a liability of some other agent in
the economy, whose liability is the dollar bill? The dollar bill is a liability—an IOU—of the Fed. It
is, of course, a strange IOU because it can only be redeemed for another IOU of the same type. It
is nonetheless classified as a liability of the Fed.
Reserve balances account for about 41 percent of the Fed’s liabilities. These are the reserves
that commercial banks hold at the Fed. Remember that commercial banks are required to keep a
certain fraction of their deposits at the Fed. These deposits are assets of the commercial banks
and liabilities of the Fed. What is remarkable about the $970 billion in reserve balances at the Fed
is that only about $65 billion are required reserves. The rest—over $900 billion—are excess
reserves, reserves that the commercial banks could lend to the private sector if they wanted to.
One of the reasons the Fed said it was buying mortgage-backed securities was to provide funds to
the commercial banks for loans to consumers and businesses. Think of a commercial bank that
owns $10 million in mortgage-backed securities. The Fed buys these securities by taking the secu-
rities and crediting the commercial bank’s account at the Fed with $10 million in reserves. The
bank is now in a position to lend this money out. Instead, what the banks have mostly done is
keep the reserves as deposits at the Fed. Banks earn a small interest rate from the Fed on their
excess reserves. So as a first approximation, one can think of the Fed’s purchase of mortgage-
backed securities as putting mortgage-backed securities on the asset side of its balance sheet and
6 The fact that the Fed is not obliged to provide gold for currency means it can never go bankrupt. When the currency was
backed by gold, it would have been possible for the Fed to run out of gold if too many of its depositors came to it at the same
time and asked to exchange their deposits for gold. If depositors come to the Fed to withdraw their deposits today, all they can
get is dollar bills. The dollar was convertible into gold internationally until August 15, 1971.

The Money Supply and the Federal Reserve System 515
excess reserves on the liability side. This also means that there is no money multiplier, which is
derived under the assumption that banks hold no excess reserves. The money supply increases
only as the excess reserves are loaned out. Banks’ holding excess reserves limits the ability of the
Fed to control the money supply, as is discussed in the next section.
How the Federal Reserve Controls the
Money Supply
To see how, in usual times when banks are not holding excess reserves,the Fed controls the supply of
money in the U.S.economy,we need to understand the role of reserves.As we have said,the required
reserve ratio establishes a link between the reserves of the commercial banks and the deposits
(money) that commercial banks are allowed to create. The reserve requirement effectively deter-
mines how much a bank has available to lend. If the required reserve ratio is 20 percent, each $1 of
reserves can support $5 in deposits. A bank that has reserves of $100,000 cannot have more than
$500,000 in deposits. If it did, it would fail to meet the required reserve ratio.
If you recall that the money supply is equal to the sum of deposits inside banks and the cur-
rency in circulation outside banks, you can see that reserves provide the leverage that the Fed
needs to control the money supply. If the Fed wants to increase the supply of money, it creates
more reserves, thereby freeing banks to create additional deposits by making more loans. If it
wants to decrease the money supply, it reduces reserves.
Three tools are available to the Fed for changing the money supply: (1) changing the
required reserve ratio, (2) changing the discount rate, and (3) engaging in open market opera-
tions. Although (3) is almost exclusively used to change the money supply, an understanding of
how (1) and (2) work is useful in understanding how (3) works. We thus begin our discussion
with the first two tools. The following discussion assumes that banks hold no excess reserves. On
p. 520 we consider the case in which banks hold excess reserves.
The Required Reserve Ratio
One way for the Fed to alter the supply of money is to change the required reserve ratio. This
process is shown in Table 25.2. Let us assume the initial required reserve ratio is 20 percent.
In panel 1, a simplified version of the Fed’s balance sheet (in billions of dollars) shows that
reserves are $100 billion and currency outstanding is $100 billion. The total value of the Fed’s
assets is $200 billion, which we assume to be all in government securities. Assuming there are no
excess reserves—banks stay fully loaned up—the $100 billion in reserves supports $500 billion in

The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
deposits at the commercial banks. (Remember, the money multiplier equals 1/required reserve
ratio = 1/.20 = 5. Thus, $100 billion in reserves can support $500 billion [$100 billion  5] in
deposits when the required reserve ratio is 20 percent.) The supply of money (M1, or transac-
tions money) is therefore $600 billion: $100 billion in currency and $500 billion in (checking
account) deposits at the commercial banks.
Now suppose the Fed wants to increase the supply of money to $900 billion. If it lowers the
required reserve ratio from 20 percent to 12.5 percent (as in panel 2 of Table 25.2), the same
$100 billion of reserves could support $800 billion in deposits instead of only $500 billion. In this
case, the money multiplier is 1/.125, or 8. At a required reserve ratio of 12.5 percent, $100 billion
in reserves can support $800 billion in deposits. The total money supply would be $800 billion in
deposits plus the $100 billion in currency, for a total of $900 billion.7
Put another way, with the new lower reserve ratio, banks have excess reserves of $37.5 bil-
lion. At a required reserve ratio of 20 percent, they needed $100 billion in reserves to back their
$500 billion in deposits. At the lower required reserve ratio of 12.5 percent, they need only
$62.5 billion of reserves to back their $500 billion of deposits; so the remaining $37.5 billion of
the existing $100 billion in reserves is “extra.”With that $37.5 billion of excess reserves, banks can
lend out more money. If we assume the system loans money and creates deposits to the
maximum extent possible, the $37.5 billion of reserves will support an additional $300 billion of
deposits ($37.5 billion  the money multiplier of 8 = $300 billion). The change in the required
reserve ratio has injected an additional $300 billion into the banking system, at which point the
banks will be fully loaned up and unable to increase their deposits further. Decreases in the
required reserve ratio allow banks to have more deposits with the existing volume of reserves. As
banks create more deposits by making loans, the supply of money (currency + deposits)
increases. The reverse is also true: If the Fed wants to restrict the supply of money, it can raise the
required reserve ratio, in which case banks will find that they have insufficient reserves and must
therefore reduce their deposits by “calling in” some of their loans.8 The result is a decrease in the
money supply.
For many reasons, the Fed has tended not to use changes in the reserve requirement to con-
trol the money supply. In part, this reluctance stems from the era when only some banks were
members of the Fed and therefore subject to reserve requirements. The Fed reasoned that if it
raised the reserve requirement to contract the money supply, banks might choose to stop being
members. (Because reserves pay no interest, the higher the reserve requirement, the more the
penalty imposed on those banks holding reserves.) This argument no longer applies. Since the
passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act in 1980, all
depository institutions are subject to Fed requirements.
It is also true that changing the reserve requirement ratio is a crude tool. Because of lags in
banks’ reporting to the Fed on their reserve and deposit positions, a change in the requirement
today does not affect banks for about 2 weeks. (However, the fact that changing the reserve
requirement expands or reduces credit in every bank in the country makes it a very powerful tool
when the Fed does use it—assuming no excess reserves held.)
The Discount Rate
Banks may borrow from the Fed. The interest rate they pay the Fed is the discount rate. When
banks increase their borrowing, the money supply increases. To see why this is true, assume that
there is only one bank in the country and that the required reserve ratio is 20 percent. The initial
position of the bank and the Fed appear in panel 1 of Table 25.3, where the money supply (cur-
rency + deposits) is $480 billion. In panel 2, the bank has borrowed $20 billion from the Fed. By
using this $20 billion as a reserve, the bank can increase its loans by $100 billion, from $320 billion
discount rate
The interest
rate that banks pay to the Fed
to borrow from it.
7 To find the maximum volume of deposits (D) that can be supported by an amount of reserves (R), divide R by the required
reserve ratio. If the required reserve ratio is g, because R = gD, then D = R/g.
8 To reduce the money supply, banks never really have to “call in” loans before they are due. First, the Fed is almost always
expanding the money supply slowly because the real economy grows steadily and, as we shall see, growth brings with it the need
for more circulating money. So when we speak of “contractionary monetary policy,” we mean the Fed is slowing down the rate
of money growth, not reducing the money supply. Second, even if the Fed were to cut reserves (instead of curb their expansion),
banks would no doubt be able to comply by reducing the volume of new loans they make while old ones are coming due.

CHAPTER 25
The Money Supply and the Federal Reserve System 517
to $420 billion. (Remember, a required reserve ratio of 20 percent gives a money multiplier of 5;
having excess reserves of $20 billion allows the bank to create an additional $20 billion  5, or
$100 billion, in deposits.) The money supply has thus increased from $480 billion to $580 billion.
Bank borrowing from the Fed thus leads to an increase in the money supply if the banks loan out
their excess reserves.
The Fed can influence bank borrowing, and thus the money supply, through the discount
rate. The higher the discount rate, the higher the cost of borrowing and the less borrowing banks
will want to do. If the Fed wants to curtail the growth of the money supply, for example, it will
raise the discount rate and discourages banks from borrowing from it, restricting the growth of
reserves (and ultimately deposits).
Historically, the Fed has not used the discount rate to control the money supply. Prior to
2003 it usually set the discount rate lower than the rate that banks had to pay to borrow money
in the private market. Although this provided an incentive for banks to borrow from the Fed, the
Fed discouraged borrowing by putting pressure in various ways on the banks not to borrow.
This pressure was sometimes called moral suasion. On January 9, 2003, the Fed announced a
new procedure. Henceforth, the discount rate would be set above the rate that banks pay to bor-
row money in the private market and moral suasion would no longer be used. Although banks
could then borrow from the Fed if they wanted to, they were unlikely to do so except in unusual
circumstances because borrowing was cheaper in the private market. In 2008, for the first time
since the Great Depression, the Fed opened its discount window not only to depository banks
but also to primary dealer credit institutions such as Credit Suisse and Cantor Fitzgerald, who
do not take bank deposits. This practice was ended in February 2010, and economists expect the
Fed to return to its historical policy of not using the discount window as a regular tool to try to
change the money supply.
Open Market Operations
By far the most significant of the Fed’s tools for controlling the supply of money is open market
operations. Congress has authorized the Fed to buy and sell U.S. government securities in the
open market. When the Fed purchases a security, it pays for it by writing a check that, when
cleared, expands the quantity of reserves in the system, increasing the money supply. When the
Fed sells a bond, private citizens or institutions pay for it with a check that, when cleared, reduces
the quantity of reserves in the system.
To see how open market operations and reserve controls work, we need to review several
key ideas.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
Two Branches of Government Deal in Government Securities
The fact that
the Fed is able to buy and sell government securities—bills and bonds—may be confusing. In
fact, two branches of government deal in financial markets for different reasons, and you must
keep the two separate in your mind.
First, keep in mind that the Treasury Department is responsible for collecting taxes and pay-
ing the federal government’s bills. Salary checks paid to government workers, payments to
General Dynamics for a new Navy ship, Social Security checks to retirees, and so on, are all writ-
ten on accounts maintained by the Treasury. Tax receipts collected by the Internal Revenue
Service, a Treasury branch, are deposited to these accounts.
If total government spending exceeds tax receipts,the law requires the Treasury to borrow the dif-
ference. Recall that the government deficit is (G - T), or government purchases minus net taxes. To
finance the deficit, (G - T) is the amount the Treasury must borrow each year. This means that the
Treasury cannot print money to finance the deficit. The Treasury borrows by issuing bills, bonds, and
notes that pay interest. These government securities, or IOUs, are sold to individuals and institutions.
Often foreign countries as well as U.S. citizens buy them.As discussed in Chapter 24, the total amount
of privately held government securities is the privately held federal debt.
The Fed is not the Treasury. Instead, it is a quasi-independent agency authorized by Congress
to buy and sell outstanding (preexisting) U.S. government securities on the open market. The
bonds and bills initially sold by the Treasury to finance the deficit are continuously resold and
traded among ordinary citizens, firms, banks, pension funds, and so on. The Fed’s participation
in that trading affects the quantity of reserves in the system, as we will see.
Because the Fed owns some government securities, some of what the government owes it
owes to itself. Recall that the Federal Reserve System’s largest single asset is government securities.
These securities are nothing more than bills and bonds initially issued by the Treasury to finance
the deficit. They were acquired by the Fed over time through direct open market purchases that
the Fed made to expand the money supply as the economy expanded.
The Mechanics of Open Market Operations
How do open market operations affect
the money supply? Look again at Table 25.1 on p. 514. As you can see, about a third of the Fed’s
assets consist of the government securities we have been talking about (U.S. Treasury securities).
Suppose the Fed wants to decrease the supply of money. If it can reduce the volume of bank
reserves on the liabilities side of its balance sheet, it will force banks, in turn, to reduce their own
deposits (to meet the required reserve ratio).Since these deposits are part of the supply of money,the
supply of money will contract. (We are continuing to assume that banks hold no excess reserves.)
What will happen if the Fed sells some of its holdings of government securities to the general
public? The Fed’s holdings of government securities must decrease because the securities it sold
will now be owned by someone else. How do the purchasers of securities pay for what they have
bought? They pay by writing checks drawn on their banks and payable to the Fed.
Let us look more carefully at how this works, with the help of Table 25.4. In panel 1, the Fed
initially has $100 billion of government securities. Its liabilities consist of $20 billion of deposits
(which are the reserves of commercial banks) and $80 billion of currency. With the required
reserve ratio at 20 percent, the $20 billion of reserves can support $100 billion of deposits in the
commercial banks. The commercial banking system is fully loaned up. Panel 1 also shows the
financial position of a private citizen, Jane Q. Public. Jane has assets of $5 billion (a large check-
ing account deposit in the bank) and no debts, so her net worth is $5 billion.
Now imagine that the Fed sells $5 billion in government securities to Jane. Jane pays for the
securities by writing a check to the Fed, drawn on her bank. The Fed then reduces the reserve
account of her bank by $5 billion. The balance sheets of all the participants after this transaction
are shown in panel 2. Note that the supply of money (currency plus deposits) has fallen from
$180 billion to $175 billion.
This is not the end of the story. As a result of the Fed’s sale of securities, the amount of
reserves has fallen from $20 billion to $15 billion, while deposits have fallen from $100 billion to
$95 billion. With a required reserve ratio of 20 percent, banks must have .20  $95 billion, or
$19 billion, in reserves. Banks are under their required reserve ratio by $4 billion [$19 billion (the
amount they should have) minus $15 billion (the amount they do have)]. What can banks do to
get back into reserve requirement balance? Look back on the bank balance sheet. Banks had made
loans of $80 billion, supported by the $100 billion deposit.With the smaller deposit, the bank can no

CHAPTER 25
The Money Supply and the Federal Reserve System 519
longer support $80 billion in loans. The bank will either “call” some of the loans (that is, ask for
repayment) or more likely reduce the number of new loans made. As loans shrink, so do deposits
in the overall banking system.
The final equilibrium position is shown in panel 3, where commercial banks have reduced
their loans by $20 billion. Notice that the change in deposits from panel 1 to panel 3 is $25 billion,
which is five times the size of the change in reserves that the Fed brought about through its $5 bil-
lion open market sale of securities. This corresponds exactly to our earlier analysis of the money
multiplier. The change in money (-$25 billion) is equal to the money multiplier (5) times the
change in reserves (-$5 billion).
Now consider what happens when the Fed purchases a government security. Suppose you hold
$100 in Treasury bills, which the Fed buys from you. The Fed writes you a check for $100, and you
turn in your Treasury bills. You then take the $100 check and deposit it in your local bank. This
increases the reserves of your bank by $100 and begins a new episode in the money expansion
story. With a reserve requirement of 20 percent, your bank can now lend out $80. If that $80 is
spent and ends up back in a bank, that bank can lend $64, and so on. (Review Figure 25.3.) The
Fed can expand the money supply by buying government securities from people who own them,
just the way it reduces the money supply by selling these securities.
Each business day the Open Market Desk in the NewYork Federal Reserve Bank buys or sells mil-
lions of dollars’worth of securities,usually to large security dealers who act as intermediaries between
the Fed and the private markets.We can sum up the effect of these open market operations this way:

The Supply of Money
If the Fed’s money supply behav-
ior is not influenced by the inter-
est rate, the money supply curve
is a vertical line. Through its
three tools, the Fed is assumed
to have the money supply be
whatever value it wants.
Open market operations are the Fed’s preferred means of controlling the money supply for
several reasons. First, open market operations can be used with some precision. If the Fed needs
to change the money supply by just a small amount, it can buy or sell a small volume of govern-
ment securities. If it wants a larger change in the money supply, it can buy or sell a larger
amount. Second, open market operations are extremely flexible. If the Fed decides to reverse
course, it can easily switch from buying securities to selling them. Finally, open market opera-
tions have a fairly predictable effect on the supply of money. Because banks are obliged to meet
their reserve requirements, an open market sale of $100 in government securities will reduce
reserves by $100, which will reduce the supply of money by $100 times the money multiplier.
Where does the Fed get the money to buy government securities when it wants to expand the
money supply? The Fed simply creates it! In effect, it tells the bank from which it has bought a
$100 security that its reserve account (deposit) at the Fed now contains $100 more than it did
previously. This is where the power of the Fed, or any central bank, lies. The Fed has the ability to
create money at will. In the United States, the Fed exercises this power when it creates money to
buy government securities.
Excess Reserves and the Supply Curve for Money
In September 2008 commercial banks began holding huge quantities of excess reserves. This has
continued through the time of this writing (July 2010). This is evident from the Fed’s balance
sheet for June 30, 2010, in Table 25.1, where all but about $65 billion of the $970 billion in reserve
balances are excess reserves. The holding of excess reserves by commercial banks obviously affects
the ability of the Fed to control the money supply. The previous discussion of the three tools
assumes that when banks get reserves, they loan them out to the limit they are allowed.
Conversely, if they lose reserves, they must cut back loans to get back in compliance with their
reserve requirements. The three tools work through the Fed changing the amount of reserves in
the banking system, which then affects loans and the money supply. If banks simply hold
increased reserves as excess reserves and adjust to a decrease in reserves by decreasing their excess
reserves, the tools do not work.
How long this holding of excess reserves will continue is unclear. Banks earn more on their
loans than they do on their excess reserves, and as the effects of the 2008–2009 recession ease,
banks are likely to go back to making more loans. This excess reserve holding may thus be tem-
porary. In the following chapters we will assume that the Fed can control the money supply, but
you should keep in mind that there are times when this assumption may not be realistic. We will
in fact relax this assumption in Chapter 28. For now, however, we assume that the supply curve
for money is vertical, as depicted in  Figure 25.5. The Fed is simply assumed to pick a value that
it wants for the money supply and achieve this value through one of its three tools. For now, this
choice is not assumed to depend on the interest rate or any other variable in the economy.

CHAPTER 25
The Money Supply and the Federal Reserve System 521
Looking Ahead
This chapter has discussed only the supply side of the money market. In the next chapter, we turn
to the demand side of the money market. We will examine the demand for money and see how
the supply of and demand for money determine the equilibrium interest rate.
AN OVERVIEW OF MONEY p. 501
1. Money has three distinguishing characteristics: (1) a means
of payment, or medium of exchange; (2) a store of value; and
(3) a unit of account. The alternative to using money is
barter, in which goods are exchanged directly for other
goods. Barter is costly and inefficient in an economy with
many different kinds of goods.
2. Commodity monies are items that are used as money and that
have an intrinsic value in some other use—for example, gold
and cigarettes. Fiat monies are intrinsically worthless apart
from their use as money. To ensure the acceptance of fiat
monies, governments use their power to declare money legal
tender and promise the public they will not debase the cur-
rency by expanding its supply rapidly.
3. There are various definitions of money. Currency plus
demand deposits plus traveler’s checks plus other checkable
deposits compose M1, or transactions money—money that
can be used directly to buy things. The addition of savings
accounts and money market accounts (near monies) to M1
gives M2, or broad money.
HOW BANKS CREATE MONEY p. 505
4. The required reserve ratio is the percentage of a bank’s
deposits that must be kept as reserves at the nation’s central
bank, the Federal Reserve.
5. Banks create money by making loans.When a bank makes a
loan to a customer, it creates a deposit in that customer’s
account. This deposit becomes part of the money supply. Banks
can create money only when they have excess reserves—reserves
in excess of the amount set by the required reserve ratio.
6. The money multiplier is the multiple by which the total supply
of money can increase for every dollar increase in reserves.
The money multiplier is equal to 1/required reserve ratio.
THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM p. 511
7. The Fed’s most important function is controlling the
nation’s money supply. The Fed also performs several other
functions: It clears interbank payments, is responsible for
many of the regulations governing banking practices and
standards, and acts as a lender of last resort for troubled
banks that cannot find any other sources of funds. The Fed
also acts as the bank for the U.S. government. Beginning in
2008 the Fed greatly expanded its lending activities to the
private sector.
HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE CONTROLS THE
MONEY SUPPLY p. 515
8. The key to understanding how the Fed controls the money
supply is the role of reserves. If the Fed wants to increase the
supply of money, it creates more reserves, freeing banks to
create additional deposits. If it wants to decrease the money
supply, it reduces reserves.
9. The Fed has three tools to control the money supply:
(1) changing the required reserve ratio, (2) changing the
discount rate (the interest rate member banks pay when they
borrow from the Fed), and (3) engaging in open market
operations (the buying and selling of already-existing gov-
ernment securities). To increase the money supply, the Fed
can create additional reserves by lowering the discount rate
or by buying government securities or the Fed can increase
the number of deposits that can be created from a given
quantity of reserves by lowering the required reserve ratio.
To decrease the money supply, the Fed can reduce reserves
by raising the discount rate or by selling government securi-
ties or it can raise the required reserve ratio. If commercial
banks hold large quantities of excess reserves, the ability of
the Fed to control the money supply is severely limited.
10. If the Fed’s money supply behavior is not influenced by the
interest rate, the supply curve for money is a vertical line.

6. Suppose in the Republic of Madison that the regulation of banking
rested with the Madison Congress, including the determination of
the reserve ratio. The Central Bank of Madison is charged with reg-
ulating the money supply by using open market operations. In
April 2011, the money supply was estimated to be 52 million hurls.
At the same time, bank reserves were 6.24 million hurls and the
reserve requirement was 12 percent. The banking industry, being
“loaned up,”lobbied the Congress to cut the reserve ratio. The
Congress yielded and cut required reserves to 10 percent.What is
the potential impact on the money supply? Suppose the central
bank decided that the money supply should not be increased.What
countermeasures could it take to prevent the Congress from
expanding the money supply?
7. The U.S. money supply (M1) at the beginning of 2000 was
$1,148 billion broken down as follows: $523 billion in currency,
$8 billion in traveler’s checks, and $616 billion in checking
deposits. Suppose the Fed decided to reduce the money supply
by increasing the reserve requirement from 10 percent to
11 percent. Assuming all banks were initially loaned up (had no
excess reserves) and currency held outside of banks did not
change, how large a change in the money supply would have
resulted from the change in the reserve requirement?
8. As king of Medivalia, you are constantly strapped for funds to
pay your army. Your chief economic wizard suggests the follow-
ing plan: “When you collect your tax payments from your sub-
jects, insist on being paid in gold coins. Take those gold coins,
melt them down, and remint them with an extra 10 percent of
brass thrown in. You will then have 10 percent more money than
you started with.”What do you think of the plan? Will it work?
9. Why is M2 sometimes a more stable measure of money than M1?
Explain in your own words using the definitions of M1 and M2.
10. Do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements?
Explain your answers.
a. When the Treasury of the United States issues bonds and
sells them to the public to finance the deficit, the money
supply remains unchanged because every dollar of money
taken in by the Treasury goes right back into circulation
through government spending. This is not true when the Fed
sells bonds to the public.
b. The money multiplier depends on the marginal propensity
to save.
1. In the Republic of Ragu, the currency is the rag. During 2009,
the Treasury of Ragu sold bonds to finance the Ragu budget
deficit. In all, the Treasury sold 50,000 10-year bonds with a face
value of 100 rags each. The total deficit was 5 million rags.
Further, assume that the Ragu Central Bank reserve require-
ment was 20 percent and that in the same year, the bank bought
500,000 rags’ worth of outstanding bonds on the open market.
Finally, assume that all of the Ragu debt is held by either the pri-
vate sector (the public) or the central bank.
a. What is the combined effect of the Treasury sale and the cen-
tral bank purchase on the total Ragu debt outstanding? on
the debt held by the private sector?
b. What is the effect of the Treasury sale on the money supply
in Ragu?
c. Assuming no leakage of reserves out of the banking system,
what is the effect of the central bank purchase of bonds on
the money supply?
2. In 2000, the federal debt was being paid down because the federal
budget was in surplus. Recall that surplus means that tax collec-
tions (T) exceed government spending (G). The surplus (T - G)
was used to buy back government bonds from the public, reduc-
ing the federal debt. As we discussed in this chapter, the main
method by which the Fed increases the money supply is to buy
government bonds by using open market operations. What is the
impact on the money supply of using the fiscal surplus to buy
back bonds? In terms of their impacts on the money supply, what
is the difference between Fed open market purchases of bonds
and Treasury purchases of bonds using tax revenues? 
3. For each of the following, determine whether it is an asset or a lia-
bility on the accounting books of a bank. Explain why in each case.

new reserves find their way out of the country into foreign
banks or foreign investment funds. In addition, some portion of
the new reserves ends up in people’s pockets and mattresses
instead of bank vaults. These “leakages” reduce the money mul-
tiplier and sometimes make it very difficult for the Fed to con-
trol the money supply precisely. Explain why this is true.
12. You are given this account for a bank:
The required reserve ratio is 10 percent.
a. How much is the bank required to hold as reserves given its
deposits of $3,500?
b. How much are its excess reserves?
c. By how much can the bank increase its loans?
d. Suppose a depositor comes to the bank and withdraws $200
in cash. Show the bank’s new balance sheet, assuming the
bank obtains the cash by drawing down its reserves. Does the
bank now hold excess reserves? Is it meeting the required
reserve ratio? If not, what can it do?
13. After suffering two years of staggering hyperinflation, the African
nation of Zimbabwe officially abandoned its currency, the
Zimbabwean dollar, in April 2009 and made the U.S. dollar its
official currency. Why would anyone in Zimbabwe be willing to
accept U.S. dollars in exchange for goods and services?
14. The following is from an article in USA TODAY.
A small but growing number of cash-strapped communities
are printing their own money. Borrowing from a
Depression-era idea, they are aiming to help consumers
make ends meet and support struggling local businesses.
The systems generally work like this: Businesses and indi-
viduals form a network to print currency. Shoppers buy it at
a discount—say, 95 cents for $1 value—and spend the full
value at stores that accept the currency. . . .

These local currencies are being issued in communities as
diverse as small towns in North Carolina and Massachusetts to
cities as large as Detroit, Michigan. Do these local currencies
qualify as money based on the description of what money is in
the chapter?
15. Suppose on your 21st birthday, your eccentric grandmother invites
you to her house, takes you into her library, removes a black velvet
painting of Elvis Presley from the wall, opens a hidden safe where
she removes 50 crisp $100 bills, and hands them to you as a pre-
sent, claiming you are her favorite grandchild. After thanking your
grandmother profusely (and helping her rehang the picture of
Elvis), you proceed to your bank and deposit half of your gift in
your checking account and half in your savings account. How will
these transactions affect M1 and M2? How will these transactions
change M1 and M2 in the short run? What about the long run?”
16. Suppose Fred deposits $8,000 in cash into his checking account at
the Bank of Bonzo. The Bank of Bonzo has no excess reserves and
is subject to a 5 percent required reserve ratio.
a. Show this transaction in a T-account for the Bank of Bonzo.
b. Assume the Bank of Bonzo makes the maximum loan possi-
ble from Fred’s deposit to Clarice and show this transaction

c. Clarice decides to use the money she borrowed to take a trip
to Tahiti. She writes a check for the entire loan amount to
the Tropical Paradise Travel Agency, which deposits the
check in its bank, the Iceberg Bank of Barrow, Alaska. When
the check clears, the Bonzo Bank transfers the funds to the
Iceberg Bank. Show these transactions in a new T-account
for the Bonzo Bank and in a T-account for the Iceberg Bank.
d. What is the maximum amount of deposits that can be cre-
ated from Fred’s initial deposit? 
e. What is the maximum amount of loans that can be created
from Fred’s initial deposit?

Money Demand and
the Equilibrium
Interest Rate
Having discussed the supply of
money in the last chapter, we now
turn to the demand for money. One
goal of this and the previous chapter
is to provide a theory of how the
interest rate is determined in the
macroeconomy. Once we have seen
how the interest rate is determined,
we can turn to how the Federal
Reserve (Fed) affects the interest rate
through its ability to change the
money supply.
Interest Rates and Bond Prices
Interest is the fee that borrowers pay to lenders for the use of their funds. Firms and govern-
ments borrow funds by issuing bonds, and they pay interest to the lenders that purchase the
bonds. Households also borrow, either directly from banks and finance companies or by taking
out mortgages.
Some loans are very simple. You might borrow $1,000 from a bank to be paid back a year
from the date you borrowed the funds. If the bank charged you, say, $100 for doing this, the inter-
est rate on the loan would be 10 percent. You would receive $1,000 now and pay back $1,100 at
the end of the year—the original $1,000 plus the interest of $100. In this simple case the interest
rate is just the interest payment divided by the amount of the loan, namely 10 percent.
Bonds are more complicated loans. Bonds have several properties. First, they are issued with
a face value, typically in denominations of $1,000. Second, they come with a maturity date, which
is the date the borrower agrees to pay the lender the face value of the bond. Third, there is a fixed
payment of a specified amount that is paid to the bondholder each year. This payment is known
as a coupon.
Say that company XYZ on January 2, 2011, issued a 15-year bond that had a face value of
$1,000 and paid a coupon of $100 per year. On this date the company sold the bond in the bond
market. The price at which the bond sold would be whatever price the market determined it to
be. Say that the market-determined price was in fact $1,000. (Firms when issuing bonds try to
choose the coupon to be such that the price that the bond initially sells for is roughly equal to its
face value.) The lender would give XYZ a check for $1,000 and every January for the next 14 years
XYZ would send the lender a check for $100. Then on January 2, 2026, XYZ would send the
lender a check for the face value of the bond—$1,000—plus the last coupon payment—$100—
and that would square all accounts. In this example the interest rate that the lender receives each
year on his or her $1,000 investment is 10 percent. If, on the other hand, the market-determined
price of the XYZ bond at the time of issue were only $900, then the interest rate that the lender
receives would be larger than 10 percent. The lender pays $900 and receives $100 each year. This
is an interest rate of roughly 11.1 percent.
A key relationship that we will use in this chapter is that market-determined prices of exist-
ing bonds and interest rates are inversely related. The fact that the coupon on a bond is
interest
The fee that
borrowers pay to lenders for
the use of their funds.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Professor Serebryakov Makes an Economic Error
In Chekhov’s play Uncle Vanya, Alexander Vladimirovitch Serebryakov,
a retired professor, but apparently not of economics, calls his household
together to make an announcement. He has retired to his country
estate, but he does not like living there. Unfortunately, the estate does
not derive enough income to allow him to live in town. To his gathered
household, he thus proposes the following:
Omitting details, I will put it before you in rough outline. Our estate
yields on an average not more than two per cent,on its capital value.
I propose to sell it. If we invest the money in suitable securities, we
should get from four to five per cent,and I think we might even have
a few thousand roubles to spare for buying a small villa in Finland.
This idea was not well received by the household, especially by
Uncle Vanya, who lost it for a while and tried to kill Professor
Serebryakov, but no one pointed out that this was bad economics. As
the beginning of this chapter discusses, if you buy a bond and interest
rates rise, the price of your bond falls. What Professor Serebryakov
does not realize is that what he is calling the capital value of the estate,
on which he is earning 2 percent, is not the value for which he could
sell the estate if the interest rate on “suitable” securities is 5 percent. If
an investor in Russia can earn 5 percent on these securities, why would
he or she buy an estate earning only 2 percent? The price of the estate
would have to fall until the return to the investor was 5 percent. To
make matters worse, it may have been that the estate was a riskier
investment than the securities, and if this were so, a return higher than
5 percent would have been required on the estate purchase to com-
pensate the investor for the extra risk. This would, of course, lower the
price of the estate even more. In short, this is not a scheme by which
the professor could earn more money than what the estate is currently
yielding. Perhaps had Uncle Vanya taken an introductory economics
course and known this, he would have been less agitated.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
unchanged over time does not mean that a bond’s price is insulated from interest rate move-
ments. Say that after XYZ issued its bond, interest rates went up so that a company similar to
XYZ when issuing a 15-year bond had to choose a coupon of $200 to have its bond initially sell
for $1,000. At $1,000 this bond is clearly a better deal than the XYZ bond at $1,000 because the
coupon is larger. If the owner of the XYZ bond wanted to sell it, what price could he or she get?
It should be obvious that he or she could not get $1,000 since people could buy the other bond
for $1,000 and earn more. The price of the XYZ bond would have to fall to have investors be
indifferent between buying it and buying the other bond. In other words, when interest rates
rise, the prices of existing bonds fall.
It is important to realize that the bond market directly determines prices of bonds, not inter-
est rates. Given a bond’s market-determined price, its face value, its maturity, and its coupon, the
interest rate, or yield, on that bond can be calculated. Interest rates are thus indirectly determined
by the bond market. Although each bond generally has at least a slightly different interest rate, we
will assume for simplicity in this and the following chapters that there is only one interest rate.
(Appendix A to this chapter provides some detail on various types of interest rates.) In fact, we
will assume in the following analysis that there is only one type of bond. The (one) interest rate is
the market-determined interest rate on this bond.
The Demand for Money
The factors and forces determining the demand for money are central issues in macroeconomics.
As we shall see, the interest rate and nominal income influence how much money households and
firms choose to hold.
Before we proceed, we must emphasize one point that may be troublesome. When we speak
of the demand for money, we are not asking these questions: How much cash would you like to
have? How much income would you like to earn? How much wealth would you like? (The answer
to these questions is presumably “as much as possible.”) Instead, we are concerned with how
much of your financial assets you want to hold in the form of money, which does not earn

1 The model that we discuss here is known in the economics profession as the Baumol/Tobin model, after the two economists
who independently derived it, William Baumol and James Tobin.
2 Although we are assuming that checking accounts do not pay interest, many do. Fortunately, all that we really need to assume
here is that the interest rate on checking accounts is less than the interest rate on “bonds.” Suppose bonds pay 10 percent interest
and checking accounts pay 5 percent. (Checking accounts must pay less than bonds. Otherwise, everyone would hold all their
wealth in checking accounts and none in bonds because checking accounts are more convenient.) When it comes to choosing
whether to hold bonds or money, the difference in the interest rates on the two matters. People are concerned about how much
extra interest they will earn from holding bonds instead of money. For simplicity, we are assuming in the following discussion
that the interest rate on checking accounts is zero.
interest, versus how much you want to hold in interest-bearing securities such as bonds. We take
as given the total amount of financial assets. Our concern here is with how these assets are divided
between money and interest-bearing securities.
The Transaction Motive
How much money to hold involves a trade-off between the liquidity of money and the interest
income offered by other kinds of assets. The main reason for holding money instead of interest-
bearing assets is that money is useful for buying things. Economists call this the transaction
motive. This rationale for holding money is at the heart of the discussion that follows.1
To keep our analysis of the demand for money clear, we need a few simplifying assumptions.
First, we assume that there are only two kinds of assets available to households: bonds and money.
By “bonds” we mean interest-bearing securities of all kinds. As noted above, we are assuming that
there is only one type of bond and only one market-determined interest rate. By “money”we mean
currency in circulation and deposits in checking accounts that do not pay interest.2
Second, we assume that income for the typical household is “bunched up.” It arrives once a
month at the beginning of the month. Spending, by contrast, is spread out over time; we assume
that spending occurs at a completely uniform rate throughout the month—that is, that the same
amount is spent each day (Figure 26.1). The mismatch between the timing of money inflow and the
timing of money outflow is sometimes called the nonsynchronization of income and spending.
Finally, we assume that spending for the month is equal to income for the month. Because
we are focusing on the transactions demand for money and not on its use as a store of value, this
assumption is perfectly reasonable.
Given these assumptions, how would a rational person (household) decide how much of
monthly income to hold as money and how much to hold as interest-bearing bonds? Suppose Jim
decides to deposit his entire paycheck in his checking account. Let us say that Jim earns $1,200
per month. The pattern of Jim’s bank account balance is illustrated in Figure 26.2. At the begin-
ning of the month, Jim’s balance is $1,200. As the month rolls by, Jim draws down his balance,
writing checks or withdrawing cash to pay for the things he buys. At the end of the month, Jim’s
bank account balance is down to zero. Just in time, he receives his next month’s paycheck,
deposits it, and the process begins again.
One useful statistic we need to calculate is the average balance in Jim’s account. Jim spends his
money at a constant $40 per day ($40 per day times 30 days per month = $1,200).His average balance
is just his starting balance ($1,200) plus his ending balance (0) divided by 2,or ($1,200 + 0)/2 = $600.
For the first half of the month, Jim has more than his average of $600 on deposit, and for the second
half of the month, he has less than his average.

528
PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
Is anything wrong with Jim’s strategy? Yes.If he follows the plan described,Jim is giving up inter-
est on his funds, interest he could be earning if he held some of his funds in interest-bearing bonds
instead of in his checking account. How could he manage his funds to give himself more interest?
Instead of depositing his entire paycheck in his checking account at the beginning of the
month, Jim could put half his paycheck into his checking account and buy a bond with the
other half. By doing this, he would run out of money in his checking account halfway
through the month. At a spending rate of $40 per day, his initial deposit of $600 would last
only 15 days. Jim would have to sell his bond halfway through the month and deposit the
$600 from the sale of the bond in his checking account to pay his bills during the second
half of the month.
Jim’s money holdings (checking account balances) if he follows this strategy are shown in
Figure 26.3. When he follows the buy-a-$600-bond strategy, Jim reduces the average amount of
money in his checking account. Comparing the dashed green lines (old strategy) with the solid
green lines (buy-$600-bond strategy), his average bank balance is exactly half of what it was with
the first strategy.3
The buy-a-$600-bond strategy seems sensible. The object of this strategy was to keep
some funds in bonds, where they could earn interest, instead of being “idle” money. Why

Jim could decide to deposit his

checking account at the start of
the month and run his balance
down to zero by the end of the
month. In this case, his average
balance would be $600.
3 Jim’s average balance for the first half of the month is (starting balance + ending balance)/2, or ($600 + 0)/2 = $300. His aver-
age for the second half of the month is also $300. His average for the month as a whole is $300. For simplicity, we are ignoring in
this discussion the interest income that Jim earns on his bond strategy. His total income is in fact higher than $1,200 per month
when he holds some bonds during the month because of the interest income he is earning.

Jim could also choose to put half
of his paycheck into his checking
account and buy a bond with the
other half of his income. At mid-
month, Jim would sell the bond
and deposit the $600 into his
checking account to pay the sec-
ond half of the month’s bills.
Following this strategy, Jim’s
average money holdings would
be $300.

CHAPTER 26
Money Demand and the Equilibrium Interest Rate 529
should he stop there? Another possibility would be for Jim to put only $400 into his checking
account on the first of the month and buy two $400 bonds. The $400 in his account will last
only 10 days if he spends $40 per day, so after 10 days he must sell one of the bonds and
deposit the $400 from the sale in his checking account. This will last through the 20th of the
month, at which point he must sell the second bond and deposit the other $400. This strategy
lowers Jim’s average money holding (checking account balance) even further, reducing his
money holdings to an average of only $200 per month, with correspondingly higher average
holdings of interest-earning bonds.
You can imagine Jim going even further. Why not hold all wealth in the form of bonds
(where it earns interest) and make transfers from bonds to money every time he makes a pur-
chase? If selling bonds, transferring funds to checking accounts, and making trips to the bank
were without cost, Jim would never hold money for more than an instant. Each time he
needed to pay cash for something or to write a check, he would go to the bank or call the
bank, transfer the exact amount of the transaction to his checking account, and withdraw the
cash or write the check to complete the transaction. If he did this constantly, he would
squeeze the most interest possible out of his funds because he would never hold assets that did
not earn interest.
In practice, money management of this kind is costly. There are brokerage fees and other
costs to buy or sell bonds, and time must be spent waiting in line at the bank or at an ATM.
At the same time, it is costly to hold assets in non-interest-bearing form because they lose
potential interest revenue.
We have a trade-off problem of the type that pervades economics. Switching more often
from bonds to money raises the interest revenue Jim earns (because the more times he switches,
the less, on average, he has to hold in his checking account and the more he can keep in bonds),
but this increases his money management costs. Less switching means more interest revenue lost
(because average money holdings are higher) but lower money management costs (fewer pur-
chases and sales of bonds, less time spent waiting in bank lines, fewer trips to the bank, and so on).
Given this trade-off, there is a level of average money balances that earns Jim the most profit, tak-
ing into account both the interest earned on bonds and the costs paid for switching from bonds
to money. This level is his optimal balance.
How does the interest rate affect the number of switches that Jim makes and thus the aver-
age money balance he chooses to hold? It is easy to see why an increase in the interest rate low-
ers the optimal money balance. If the interest rate were only 2 percent, it would not be
worthwhile to give up much liquidity by holding bonds instead of cash or checking balances.
However, if the interest rate were 30 percent, the opportunity cost of holding money instead of
bonds would be quite high and we would expect people to keep most of their funds in bonds
and to spend considerable time managing their money balances. The interest rate represents
the opportunity cost of holding money (and therefore not holding bonds, which pay interest).
The higher the interest rate, the higher the opportunity cost of holding money and the less
money people will want to hold. When interest rates are high, people want to take advantage of
the high return on bonds, so they choose to hold very little money. Appendix B to this chapter
provides a detailed example of this principle.
A demand curve for money, with the interest rate representing the “price” of money, would
look like the curve labeled Md in Figure 26.4. At higher interest rates, bonds are more attractive
than money, so people hold less money because they must make a larger sacrifice in interest for
each dollar of money they hold. The curve in Figure 26.4 slopes downward, just like an ordinary
demand curve for oranges or shoes. There is an inverse relationship between the interest rate and
the quantity of money demanded.4
4 The theory of money demand presented here assumes that people know the exact timing of their income and spending. In
practice, both have some uncertainty attached to them. For example, some income payments may be unexpectedly delayed a few
days or weeks, and some expenditures may arise unexpectedly (such as the cost of repairing a plumbing problem). Because peo-
ple know that this uncertainty exists, as a precaution against unanticipated delays in income receipts or unanticipated expenses,
they may choose to hold more money than the strict transactions motive would suggest. This reason for holding money is some-
times called the precautionary motive.

530
PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
The Speculation Motive
A number of other theories have been offered to explain why the quantity of money households
want to hold may rise when interest rates fall and fall when interest rates rise. One theory involves
household expectations and the fact, as discussed at the beginning of this chapter, that interest
rates and bond prices are inversely related.
Consider your desire to hold money balances instead of bonds. If market interest rates are
higher than normal, you may expect them to come down in the future. If and when interest rates
fall, the bonds that you bought when interest rates were high will increase in price. When interest
rates are high, the opportunity cost of holding cash balances is high and there is a speculation
motive for holding bonds in lieu of cash. You are “speculating” that interest rates will fall in the
future and thus that bond prices will rise.
Similarly, when market interest rates are lower than normal, you may expect them to rise
in the future. Rising interest rates will bring about a decline in the price of existing bonds.
Thus, when interest rates are low, it is a good time to be holding money and not bonds. When
interest rates are low, not only is the opportunity cost of holding cash balances low, but also
there is a speculative motive for holding a larger amount of money. Why should you put
money into bonds now when you expect interest rates to rise in the future and thus bond
prices to fall?
The Total Demand for Money
So far we have talked only about household demand for checking account balances. However, the
total quantity of money demanded in the economy is the sum of the demand for checking
account balances and cash by both households and firms.
The trade-off for firms is the same as it was for Jim. Like households, firms must manage
their money. They have payrolls to meet and purchases to make, they receive cash and checks
from sales, and many firms that deal with the public must make change—they need cash in the
cash register. Thus, just like Jim, firms need money to engage in ordinary transactions.
However, firms as well as households can hold their assets in interest-earning form. Firms
manage their assets the same way households do, keeping some in cash, some in their checking
accounts, and some in bonds. A higher interest rate raises the opportunity cost of money for
firms as well as for households and thus reduces the demand for money.
The same trade-off holds for cash. We all walk around with some money in our pockets,
but not thousands of dollars, for routine transactions. We carry, on average, about what we
think we will need, not more, because there are costs—risks of being robbed and forgone
interest. At any given moment, there is a demand for money—for cash and checking account
balances. Although households and firms need to hold balances for everyday transactions,

CHAPTER 26
Money Demand and the Equilibrium Interest Rate 531
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
ATMs and the Demand for Money
Years ago the typical college student spent many a Friday afternoon
visiting a bank to make sure he or she had enough cash for weekend
activities. Today the typical student, whether in the United States or
abroad, doesn’t need to plan ahead. As a result of automated teller
machines (ATMs), access to your bank account is available 24-7.What
difference has the spread of ATMs made on the demand for money?
Italy makes a great case study of the effects of the spread of
ATMs on the demand for money. In Italy, virtually all checking
accounts pay interest. What doesn’t pay interest is cash. So from the
point of view of the model in this chapter, we can think of Italian
checking accounts as (interest-earning) “bonds” and cash as (non-
interest-earning) “money.” In other words, in Italy there is an
interest cost to carrying cash instead of depositing the cash in a
checking account. A recent paper by three economists—Orazio
Attansio from University College London, Luigi Guiso from the
University of Sassari, Italy, and Tullio Jappelli from the
University of Salerno, Italy—took advantage of this institutional
fact to see how the availability of ATMs influence the demand for
cash (non-interest-earning money).1
Why do we think there might be an effect? Think back to the
college student of 20 years ago. On Friday, he or she might have
withdrawn cash in excess of expected weekly needs just in case.
With ATMs everywhere, cash can be withdrawn as needed. This
means that the amount of cash needed to support a given level of
consumption should fall as ATMs proliferate. This is exactly what
Attansio, Guiso, and Jappelli found in Italy in the first six years of
ATM adoption. In 1989, ATM adoption in Italy was relatively low,
about 15 percent of the population. By 1995, ATM use had risen
to about 40 percent.
What happened to
cash holdings in this
period? The amount
of cash divided by
total consumption
fell from 3.8 percent
to 2.8 percent. The
study also found, as
we would expect from
our discussion in the
text, that the demand
for cash responds to
changes in the interest
rate paid on checking
accounts. The higher
the interest rate, the
less cash held.In other
words,when the inter-
est rate on checking
accounts rises, people
go to ATM machines
more often and take out less in cash each time,thereby keeping,on aver-
age, more in checking accounts earning the higher interest rate.

Household Data,” Journal of Political Economy, April 2002.
their demand has a limit. For both households and firms, the quantity of money demanded at
any moment depends on the opportunity cost of holding money, a cost determined by the
interest rate.
The Effect of Nominal Income on the Demand for Money
In the model we began constructing in Chapter 23, we let 
denote aggregate output and income.
We noted at the beginning of Chapter 23 that you should think of
as being in real terms rather
than in nominal terms. This has in fact made no difference so far because we have not yet intro-
duced the aggregate price level. We now need to do this, and we will let 
denote the aggregate
price level.
is real output and income and 
is nominal output and income.
We need to introduce nominal income at this stage because in the above theory of the demand
for money, everything is nominal. Jim’s income of $1,200 per month is nominal, and his money
holdings are nominal. In the demand for money curve in Figure 26.4, the quantity of money,
, is
nominal. Figure 26.4 says that the nominal demand for money depends on the interest rate.
What happens to Jim’s strategy if his income is $2,400 per month rather than $1,200 per
month? If we continue to assume that he spends all of his income during the month, then every-
thing is just double from what it was before. If, for example, his optimal strategy was to go to the
bank once during the middle of the month (as in Figure 26.3), then his average money holdings
will now be $600, double the $300 when his income was $1,200 per month. The demand for
(nominal) money thus increases as nominal income increases. This means that the demand for
money curve in Figure 26.4 shifts out when nominal income increases. This is drawn in Figure 26.5.
An increase in

The Equilibrium Interest Rate
We are now in a position to consider one of the key questions in macroeconomics: How is the
interest rate determined in the economy?
Financial markets (what we call the money market) work very well in the United States.
Almost all financial markets clear—that is, almost all reach an equilibrium where quantity
demanded equals quantity supplied. In the money market, the point at which the quantity of
money demanded equals the quantity of money supplied determines the equilibrium interest
rate in the economy. This explanation sounds simple, but it requires elaboration.
Supply and Demand in the Money Market
We saw in Chapter 25 that the Fed controls the money supply through its manipulation of the
amount of reserves in the economy. Because we are assuming that the Fed’s money supply
behavior does not depend on the interest rate, the money supply curve is a vertical line. (Review
Figure 25.5 on p. 520.) In other words, we are assuming that the Fed uses its three tools (the
required reserve ratio, the discount rate, and open market operations) to achieve its fixed target
for the money supply.
Figure 26.6 superimposes the vertical money supply curve from Figure 25.5 on the
downward-sloping money demand curve. Only at interest rate r* is the quantity of money in
circulation (the money supply) equal to the quantity of money demanded. To understand
TABLE 26.1
Determinants of Money Demand
1. The interest rate: r (The quantity of money demanded is a negative function of the interest rate.)
2. Aggregate nominal output (income) 
a. Real aggregate output (income): Y (An increase in Y shifts the money demand curve to the right.)
b. The  aggregate price level: P (An increase in P shifts the money demand curve to the right.)

It is important to realize that 
can increase because increases or because increases (or
both). Thus an increase in , the aggregate price level, increases the demand for money, as does an
increase in , real aggregate income.

why r* is an equilibrium, we need to ask what forces drive the interest rate to r*. Keep in
mind in the following discussion that when the Fed fixes the money supply it also fixes the
supply of bonds. The decision of households and firms is to decide what fraction of their
funds to hold in non-interest-bearing money versus interest-bearing bonds. At the equilib-
rium interest rate r* in Figure 26.6 the demand for bonds by households and firms is equal
to the supply.
Consider r0 in Figure 26.6, an interest rate higher than the equilibrium rate. At this interest
rate households and firms would want to hold more bonds than the Fed is supplying (and less
money than the Fed is supplying). They would bid the price of bonds up and thus the interest rate
down. The bond market would clear when the price of bonds fell enough to correspond to an
interest rate of r*. At interest rate r1 in Figure 26.6, which is lower than the equilibrium rate,
households and firms would want to hold fewer bonds than the fed is supplying (and more
money than the Fed is supplying). They would bid the price of bonds down and thus the interest
rate up. The bond market would clear when the price of bonds rose enough to correspond to an
interest rate of r*.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
Changing the Money Supply to Affect the Interest Rate
With an understanding of equilibrium in the money market, we now see how the Fed can
affect the interest rate. Suppose the current interest rate is 7 percent and the Fed wants to
reduce the interest rate. To do so, it would expand the money supply. Figure 26.7 shows how
such an expansion would work. To expand Ms, the Fed can reduce the reserve requirement, cut
the discount rate, or buy U.S. government securities on the open market. All these practices
expand the quantity of reserves in the system. Banks can make more loans, and the money
supply expands even more. (Review Chapter 25 if you are unsure why.) In Figure 26.7, the ini-
tial money supply curve,
shifts to the right, to 
At 
the supply of bonds is smaller
than it was at 
.
As the money supply expands from 
to 
, the supply of bonds is decreasing, which
drives up the price of bonds. At 
the equilibrium price of bonds corresponds to an interest rate
of 4 percent. So the new equilibrium interest rate is 4 percent.
If the Fed wanted to increase the interest rate, it would contract the money supply. It could
do so by increasing the reserve requirement, by raising the discount rate, or by selling U.S. gov-
ernment securities in the open market. Whichever tool the Fed chooses, the result would be lower
reserves and a lower supply of money. The supply of money curve in Figure 26.7 would shift to
the left, and the equilibrium interest rate would rise. (As an exercise, draw a graph of this situa-
tion and explain why the interest rate would rise.)
Increases in P Y and Shifts in the Money Demand Curve
Changes in the supply of money are not the only factors that influence the equilibrium interest
rate. Shifts in money demand can do the same thing.
Recall that the demand for money depends on both the interest rate, r, and nominal income
(
). An increase in 
shifts the money demand curve to the right. This is illustrated in
Figure 26.8. If the increase in 
is such as to shift the money demand curve from 
to 
the result is an increase in the equilibrium level of the interest rate from 4 percent to 7 percent. A
decrease in 
would shift 
to the left, and the equilibrium interest rate would fall.
Remember that 
can change because the price level P changes or because real income Y
changes (or both).

CHAPTER 26
Money Demand and the Equilibrium Interest Rate 535
Zero Interest Rate Bound
By the middle of 2008 the Fed had driven the short-term interest rate close to zero, and it
remained at essentially zero through the middle of 2010. The Fed does this, of course, by increas-
ing the money supply until the intersection of the money supply at the demand for money curve
is at an interest rate of roughly zero. At a zero interest rate people are indifferent whether they
hold non-interest-bearing money or zero interest-bearing bonds. The Fed cannot drive the inter-
est rate lower than zero.5
A zero interest rate prevents the Fed from stimulating the economy further. We discuss this
in Chapters 27 and 28. If the Fed cannot lower the interest rate because the rate is at zero, there is
no room for it to stimulate investment.
Looking Ahead: The Federal Reserve and
Monetary Policy
We now know that the Fed can change the interest rate by changing the quantity of money sup-
plied. If the Fed increases the quantity of money, the interest rate falls. If the Fed decreases the
quantity of money, the interest rate rises.
Nonetheless, we have not yet said why the Fed might want to change the interest rate or what
happens to the economy when the interest rate changes. We have hinted at why: A low interest
rate stimulates spending, particularly investment; a high interest rate reduces spending. By
changing the interest rate, the Fed can change aggregate output (income). In the next chapter, we
will combine our discussions of the goods and money markets and discuss how the interest rate
affects the equilibrium level of aggregate output (income) (Y) in the goods market.
The Fed’s use of its power to influence events in the goods market as well as in the money
market is the center of the government’s monetary policy. When the Fed moves to contract the
money supply and thus raise interest rates in an effort to restrain the economy, economists call it
a tight monetary policy. Conversely, when the Fed stimulates the economy by expanding the
money supply and thus lower interest rates, it has an easy monetary policy. We will discuss the
way in which the economy affects the Fed’s behavior in Chapter 28.

5 In fact there are times when an interest rate can be negative. Financial institutions may at times be willing to hold bonds with a
negative interest rate over cash (with a zero interest rate) for security purposes. The financial institutions in effect pay a small fee
to hold the bonds—the fee being the negative interest rate.

INTEREST RATES AND BOND PRICES p. 525
1. Interest is the fee that borrowers pay to lenders for the use of
their funds. Interest rates and bond prices are inversely
related. Although there are many different interest rates in
the United States, we assume for simplicity that there is only
one interest rate in the economy.
THE DEMAND FOR MONEY p. 526 
2. The demand for money depends negatively on the interest
rate. The higher the interest rate, the higher the opportunity
cost (more interest forgone) from holding money and the
less money people will want to hold. An increase in the
interest rate reduces the quantity demanded for money, and
the money demand curve slopes downward.
3. The demand for money depends positively on nominal
income. Aggregate nominal income is
, where P is the
aggregate price level and Y is the aggregate real income. An
increase in either P or Y increases the demand for money.
THE EQUILIBRIUM INTEREST RATE p. 532 
4. The point at which the quantity of money supplied equals
the quantity of money demanded determines the equilibrium
interest rate in the economy. An excess supply of money will
cause households and firms to buy more bonds, driving the
interest rate down. An excess demand for money will cause
households and firms to move out of bonds, driving the
interest rate up.

1. State whether you agree or disagree with the following state-
ments and explain why.
a. When the real economy expands (Y rises), the demand for
money expands. As a result, households hold more cash and
the supply of money expands.
b. Inflation, a rise in the price level, causes the demand for
money to decline. Because inflation causes money to be
worth less, households want to hold less of it.
c. If the Fed buys bonds in the open market and at the same time
we experience a recession, interest rates will no doubt rise.
2. During 2003, we began to stop worrying that inflation was a prob-
lem. Instead, we began to worry about deflation, a decline in the
price level. Assume that the Fed decided to hold the money supply
constant. What impact would deflation have on interest rates?
3. [Related to Economics in Practice on p. 531] How many times
a week do you use an ATM? If ATMs were not available, would
you carry more cash? Would you keep more money in your
checking account? How many times a day do you use cash?
4. What if, at a low level of interest rates, the money demand curve
became nearly horizontal, as in the following graph. That is,
with interest rates so low, the public would not find it attractive
to hold bonds; thus, money demand would be very high. Many
argue that this was the position of the U.S. economy in 2003. If
the Fed decided to expand the money supply in the graph, what
would be the impact on interest rates?
5. During the fourth quarter of 1993, real GDP in the United
States grew at an annual rate of over 7 percent. During 1994, the
economy continued to expand with modest inflation. (Y rose at
a rate of 4 percent and P increased about 3 percent.) At the
beginning of 1994, the prime interest rate (the interest rate that
banks offer their best, least risky customers) stood at 6 percent,
where it remained for over a year. By the beginning of 1995, the
prime rate had increased to over 8.5 percent.
a. By using money supply and money demand curves, show the
effects of the increase in Y and P on interest rates, assuming
no change in the money supply.
b. On a separate graph, show that the interest rate can rise
even if the Federal Reserve expands the money supply 
as long as it does so more slowly than money demand 
is increasing.
6. Illustrate the following situations using supply and demand
curves for money:
a. The Fed buys bonds in the open market during a recession.
b. During a period of rapid inflation, the Fed increases the
reserve requirement.
c. The Fed acts to hold interest rates constant during a period
of high inflation.
d. During a period of no growth in GDP and zero inflation, the
Fed lowers the discount rate.
e. During a period of rapid real growth of GDP, the Fed acts to
increase the reserve requirement.
7. During a recession, interest rates may fall even if the Fed takes
no action to expand the money supply. Why? Use a graph 
to explain.
8. During the summer of 1997, Congress and the president
agreed on a budget package to balance the federal budget. The
“deal,” signed into law by President Clinton in August as the
Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, contained substantial tax cuts
and expenditure reductions. The tax reductions were sched-
uled to take effect immediately, however, while the expendi-
ture cuts would come mostly in 1999 to 2002. Thus, in 1998,
the package was seen by economists to be mildly expansion-
ary. If the result is an increase in the growth of real

5. The Fed can affect the equilibrium interest rate by changing
the supply of money using one of its three tools—the
required reserve ratio, the discount rate, or open market
operations.
6. An increase in either P or Y, which shifts the money
demand curve to the right, increases the equilibrium inter-
est rate. A decrease in either P or Y decreases the equilib-
rium interest rate.
7. Tight monetary policy refers to Fed policies that contract the
money supply and thus raise interest rates in an effort to
restrain the economy. Easy monetary policy refers to Fed
policies that expand the money supply and thus lower inter-
est rates in an effort to stimulate the economy. The Fed
chooses between these two types of policies for different rea-
sons at different times.

output/income, what would you expect to happen to interest
rates if the Fed holds the money supply (or the rate of growth
of the money supply) constant? What would the Fed do if it
wanted to raise interest rates? What if it wanted to lower
interest rates? Illustrate with graphs.
9. The demand for money in a country is given by
Md= 10,000 - 10,000r +
where Md is money demand in dollars, r is the interest rate (a
10 percent interest rate means r = 0.1), and 
is national
income. Assume that 
is initially 5,000.
a. Graph the amount of money demanded (on the horizontal
axis) against the interest rate (on the vertical axis).
b. Suppose the money supply (Ms) is set by the central bank at
$10,000. On the same graph you drew for part a., add the
money supply curve. What is the equilibrium rate of inter-
est? Explain how you arrived at your answer.
c. Suppose income rises from 
= 5,000 to 
= 7,500.
What happens to the money demand curve you drew in part a.?
Draw the new curve if there is one. What happens to the equi-
librium interest rate if the central bank does not change the
supply of money?
d. If the central bank wants to keep the equilibrium interest
rate at the same value as it was in part b., by how much
should it increase or decrease the supply of money given the
new level of national income?
e. Suppose the shift in part c. has occurred and the money sup-
ply remains at $10,000 but there is no observed change in
the interest rate. What might have happened that could
explain this?
10. The United States entered a deep recession at the end of
2007. The Fed under Ben Bernanke used aggressive monetary
policy to prevent the recession from becoming another Great
Depression. The Fed Funds target rate was 5.25 percent in
the fall of 2007; by mid-2008, it stood at 2 percent; and in
January 2009, it went to a range of 0-0.25 percent, where it
still stood through mid-2010. Lower interest rates reduce the
cost of borrowing and encourage firms to borrow and invest.
They also have an effect on the value of the bonds (private
and government) outstanding in the economy. Explain
briefly but clearly why the value of bonds changes when
interest rates change. Go to federalreserve.gov, click on

11. Normally, people in the United States and from around the world
think of highly rated corporate or government bonds as a safe
place to put their savings relative to common stocks. Because the
stock market had performed so poorly during the recession and
because many foreigners turned to the United States as a safe
place to invest, bond sales boomed.
If you were a holder of high-grade fixed rate bonds that
you purchased a few years earlier when rates were much higher,
you found yourself with big capital gains. That is, as rates went
lower, the value of previously issued bonds increased. Many
investment advisers in late 2010 were telling their clients to
avoid bonds because inflation was going to come back.
a. Suppose you bought a $10,000 ten-year fixed rate bond
issued by the U.S. Treasury in July 2007 that paid 5% inter-
est. In July 2010, new seven-year fixed rate bonds were being
sold by the Treasury that paid 2.43%. Explain clearly what
was likely to have happened to the value of your bond which
still has 7 years to run paying 5%? 
b. Why would bond prices rise if people feared a recession 
was coming?
c. Why would fear of inflation lead to losses for bondholders?
d. Look back and see what happened in late 2010 into 2011?
Did the Fed keep rates low? Did the recession end?  Did we
see the start of inflation? Explain.
12. Explain what will happen to holdings of bonds and money if
there is an excess supply of money in the economy. What will
happen if there is an excess demand for money in the economy?
What will happen to interest rates in each of these cases?
13. The island nation of Macadamia recently experienced an 
800 percent jump in tourism, increasing income throughout
the island. Suppose the Macadamia money market was in
equilibrium prior to the rise in tourism. What impact will
the increase in income have on the equilibrium interest rate
in Macadamia, assuming no change in the supply of money?
What will the Macadamia Central Bank have to do to keep
the increase in income from impacting the interest rate?
14. All else equal, what effect will an expansionary fiscal policy
have on the money market, and how will this change impact
the effectiveness of the fiscal policy? Draw a graph to illustrate
your answer.
15. Explain the differences between the transaction motive for
holding money and the speculation motive for holding money.
CHAPTER 26 APPENDIX A
The Various Interest Rates in the
U.S. Economy
Although there are many different interest rates in the econ-
omy, they tend to move up or down with one another. Here we
discuss some of their differences. We first look at the relation-
ship between interest rates on securities with different
maturities, or terms. We then briefly discuss some of the main
interest rates in the U.S. economy.
The Term Structure of Interest Rates
The term structure of interest rates is the relationship among the
interest rates offered on securities of different maturities. The key
here is understanding issues such as these: How are these different
rates related? Does a 2-year security (an IOU that promises to
repay principal, plus interest, after 2 years) pay a lower annual rate
than a 1-year security (an IOU to be repaid, with interest, after
1 year)? What happens to the rate of interest offered on 1-year
securities if the rate of interest on 2-year securities increases?

538
PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
1 For longer terms, additional future rates must be averaged in. For a 3-year secu-
rity, for example, the expected 1-year rate a year from now and the expected 1-year
rate 2 years from now are added to the current 1-year rate and averaged.
Assume that you want to invest some money for 2 years
and at the end of the 2 years you want it back. Assume that you
want to buy government securities. For this analysis, we restrict
your choices to two: (1) You can buy a 2-year security today
and hold it for 2 years, at which time you cash it in (we will
assume that the interest rate on the 2-year security is 9 percent
per year), or (2) you can buy a 1-year security today. At the end
of 1 year, you must cash this security in; you can then buy
another 1-year security. At the end of the second year, you will
cash in the second security. Assume that the interest rate on the
first 1-year security is 8 percent.
Which would you prefer? Currently, you do not have
enough data to answer this question. To consider choice
(2) sensibly, you need to know the interest rate on the 1-year
security that you intend to buy in the second year. This rate will
not be known until the second year. All you know now is the
rate on the 2-year security and the rate on the current 1-year
security. To decide what to do, you must form an expectation of
the rate on the 1-year security a year from now. If you expect
the 1-year rate (8 percent) to remain the same in the second
year, you should buy the 2-year security. You would earn 9 per-
cent per year on the 2-year security but only 8 percent per year
on the two 1-year securities. If you expect the 1-year rate to rise
to 12 percent a year from now, you should make the second
choice. You would earn 8 percent in the first year, and you
expect to earn 12 percent in the second year. The expected rate
of return over the 2 years is about 10 percent, which is better
than the 9 percent you can get on the 2-year security. If you
expect the 1-year rate a year from now to be 10 percent, it does
not matter very much which of the two choices you make. The
rate of return over the 2-year period will be roughly 9 percent
for both choices.
We now alter the focus of our discussion to get to the topic
we are really interested in—how the 2-year rate is determined.
Assume that the 1-year rate has been set by the Fed and it is
8 percent. Also assume that people expect the 1-year rate a year
from now to be 10 percent.What is the 2-year rate? According to
a theory called the expectations theory of the term structure of
interest rates, the 2-year rate is equal to the average of the current
1-year rate and the 1-year rate expected a year from now. In this
example, the 2-year rate would be 9 percent (the average of
8 percent and 10 percent).
If the 2-year rate were lower than the average of the two
1-year rates, people would not be indifferent as to which security
they held. They would want to hold only the short-term 1-year
securities.To find a buyer for a 2-year security,the seller would be
forced to increase the interest rate it offers on the 2-year security
until it is equal to the average of the current 1-year rate and the
expected 1-year rate for next year. The interest rate on the 2-year
security will continue to rise until people are once again indiffer-
ent between one 2-year security and two 1-year securities.1
Let us now return to Fed behavior. We know that the Fed
can affect the short-term interest rate by changing the money
supply, but does it also affect long-term interest rates? The
answer is “somewhat.” Because the 2-year rate is an average of
the current 1-year rate and the expected 1-year rate a year from
now, the Fed influences the 2-year rate to the extent that it
influences the current 1-year rate. The same holds for 3-year
rates and beyond. The current short-term rate is a means by
which the Fed can influence longer-term rates.
In addition, Fed behavior may directly affect people’s
expectations of the future short-term rates, which will then
affect long-term rates. If the chair of the Fed testifies before
Congress that raising short-term interest rates is under consid-
eration, people’s expectations of higher future short-term
interest rates are likely to increase. These expectations will then
be reflected in current long-term interest rates.
Types of Interest Rates
The following are some widely followed interest rates in the
United States.
Three-Month Treasury Bill Rate
Government secu-
rities that mature in less than a year are called Treasury bills, or
sometimes T-bills. The interest rate on 3-month Treasury bills
is probably the most widely followed short-term interest rate.
Government Bond Rate
Government securities with
terms of 1 year or more are called government bonds. There are
1-year bonds, 2-year bonds, and so on, up to 30-year bonds.
Bonds of different terms have different interest rates. The rela-
tionship among the interest rates on the various maturities is
the term structure of interest rates that we discussed in the first
part of this Appendix.
Federal Funds Rate
Banks borrow not only from the
Fed but also from each other. If one bank has excess reserves, it
can lend some of those reserves to other banks through the
federal funds market. The interest rate in this market is called
the federal funds rate—the rate banks are charged to borrow
reserves from other banks.
The federal funds market is really a desk in New York
City. From all over the country, banks with excess reserves to
lend and banks in need of reserves call the desk and negoti-
ate a rate of interest. Account balances with the Fed are
changed for the period of the loan without any physical
movement of money.
This borrowing and lending, which takes place near the
close of
each working day, is generally for 1 day
(“overnight”), so the federal funds rate is a 1-day rate. It is
the rate on which the Fed has the most effect through its
open market operations.
Commercial Paper Rate
Firms have several alterna-
tives for raising funds. They can sell stocks, issue bonds, or bor-
row from a bank. Large firms can also borrow directly from the
public by issuing “commercial paper,” which is essentially
short-term corporate IOUs that offer a designated rate of
interest. The interest rate offered on commercial paper

CHAPTER 26
Money Demand and the Equilibrium Interest Rate 539
depends on the financial condition of the firm and the matu-
rity date of the IOU.
Prime Rate
Banks charge different interest rates to dif-
ferent customers depending on how risky the banks perceive
the customers to be. You would expect to pay a higher inter-
est rate for a car loan than General Motors would pay for a
$1 million loan to finance investment. Also, you would pay
more interest for an unsecured loan, a “personal” loan, than
for one that was secured by some asset, such as a house or
car, to be used as collateral.
The prime rate is a benchmark that banks often use in
quoting interest rates to their customers. A very low-risk cor-
poration might be able to borrow at (or even below) the prime
rate. A less well-known firm might be quoted a rate of “prime
plus three-fourths,” which means that if the prime rate is, say,
10 percent, the firm would have to pay interest of 10.75 per-
cent. The prime rate depends on the cost of funds to the bank;
it moves up and down with changes in the economy.
AAA Corporate Bond Rate
Corporations finance
much of their investment by selling bonds to the public.
Corporate bonds are classified by various bond dealers
according to their risk. Bonds issued by General Motors are
in less risk of default than bonds issued by a new risky
biotech research firm. Bonds differ from commercial paper
in one important way: Bonds have a longer maturity.
Bonds are graded in much the same way students are.
The highest grade is AAA, the next highest AA, and so on.
The interest rate on bonds rated AAA is the triple A corporate
bond rate, the rate that the least risky firms pay on the bonds
that they issue.
1. The following table gives three key U.S. interest rates in 1980
and again in 1993:
Provide an explanation for the extreme differences that you
see. Specifically, comment on (1) the fact that rates in 1980
were much higher than in 1993 and (2) the fact that the long-

lower in 1980.

CHAPTER 26 APPENDIX B
The Demand For Money: A
Numerical Example
This Appendix presents a numerical example showing how
optimal money management behavior can be derived.
We have seen that the interest rate represents the oppor-
tunity cost of holding funds in non-interest-bearing check-
ing accounts (as opposed to bonds, which yield interest). We
have also seen that costs are involved in switching from
bonds to money. Given these costs, our objective is to deter-
mine the optimum amount of money for an individual to
hold. The optimal average level of money holdings is the
amount that maximizes the profits from money manage-
ment. Interest is earned on average bond holdings, but the
cost per switch multiplied by the number of switches must
be subtracted from interest revenue to obtain the net profit
from money management.
Suppose the interest rate is .05 (5 percent), it costs 
$2 each time a bond is sold,1 and the proceeds from the sale
are deposited in one’s checking account. Suppose also that
the individual’s income is $1,200 and that this income is
spent evenly throughout the period. This situation is
depicted in the top half of Table 26B.1. The optimum value
for average money holdings is the value that achieves the
largest possible profit in column 6 of the table. When the
interest rate is 5 percent, the optimum average money hold-
ings are $150 (which means that the individual makes three
switches from bonds to money).
In the bottom half of Table 26B.1, the same calculations
are performed for an interest rate of 3 percent instead of
5 percent. In this case, the optimum average money hold-
ings is $200 (which means the person/household makes two
instead of three switches from bonds to money). The lower
interest rate has led to an increase in the optimum average
money holdings. Under the assumption that people behave
optimally, the demand for money is a negative function of
the interest rate: The lower the rate, the more money on
average is held, and the higher the rate, the less money on
average is held.
1 In this example, we will assume that the $2 cost does not apply to the original
purchase of bonds.

receives at the beginning of each month. He spends the entire
amount each month at the rate of $50 per day. (Assume 30 days
in a month.) The interest rate paid on bonds is 10 percent per
month. It costs $4 every time Peabody sells a bond.

money to hold.
b. Calculate Peabody’s optimal money holdings. (Hint: It may
help to formulate a table such as Table 26B.1 in this Appendix.
You can round to the nearest $0.50, and you need to consider
only average money holdings of more than $100.)

happen if the interest rate increases to 20 percent?

Aggregate Demand
in the Goods and
Money Markets 
In Chapters 23 and 24, we discussed
the market for goods and services—
the goods market—without men-
tioning money, the money market, or
the interest rate. We described how
the equilibrium level of aggregate
output (income) (Y) is determined in
the goods market. At given levels of
planned investment spending (I),
government spending (G), and net
taxes (T), we were able to determine
the equilibrium level of output in 
the economy.In Chapters 25 and 26,
we discussed the financial market, or money market, barely referring to the goods market, as we
explained how the equilibrium level of the interest rate is determined in the money market.
The goods market and the money market do not operate independently, and the purpose of
this chapter is to put the two markets together. The key link between the two markets is the inter-
est rate. When the Fed changes the money supply and thus changes the interest rate, this affects
aggregate demand. In practice the main components of aggregate demand that are affected by the
interest rate are consumption of durable goods, housing investment, and plant and equipment
investment by firms. When the interest rate increases, these components of aggregate demand
decrease. For simplicity we will assume in what follows that only investment by firms—what we
are calling planned investment—is affected by the interest rate. This is discussed in the next sec-
tion. Keep in mind, however, that this is done only for simplicity. In practice, the interest rate
affects other components of aggregate demand. In particular, households are affected through
their demand for durable goods (autos, furniture, and the like) and their demand for housing.
Once we postulate that planned investment depends on the interest rate, we will see that
events in the money market affect the goods market and events in the goods market affect the
money market. Only by analyzing the two markets together can we determine the values of aggre-
gate output (income) (Y) and the interest rate (r) that are consistent with the existence of equi-
librium in both markets.
Looking at both markets simultaneously also reveals how fiscal policy affects the money
market and how monetary policy affects the goods market. This is what we will do in this chap-
ter. By establishing how the two markets affect each other, we will show how open market pur-
chases of government securities (which expand the money supply) affect the equilibrium level
of aggregate output. Similarly, we will show how fiscal policy measures affect the interest rate.
The relationship between aggregate output and the price level that exists when the goods and
money markets are combined can be summarized in a curve called the aggregate demand (AD)
curve. Every point on the AD curve reflects equilibrium in both the goods and money markets for
the given price level. In the last part of this chapter, we derive the AD curve from the relationships
in the goods and money markets. The AD curve is then used in the next chapter in determining the
price level. For purposes of this chapter the price level P is still not determined. Also, remember
that Y is real income, not nominal income.

Planned Investment and the Interest Rate
We have so far assumed for simplicity that planned investment is fixed, and we now must
relax this assumption. In practice planned investment depends on many factors, but we focus
here on just one: the interest rate. Recall that investment refers to a firm’s purchase of new
capital—new machines and plants. Whether a firm decides to invest in a project depends on
whether the expected profits from the project justify its costs. And one cost of an investment
project is the interest cost. When a manufacturing firm builds a new plant, the contractor
must be paid at the time the plant is built. The money needed to carry out such projects is gen-
erally borrowed and paid back over an extended period. The real cost of an investment project
thus depends in part on the interest rate—the cost of borrowing. When the interest rate rises,
it becomes more expensive to borrow and fewer projects are likely to be undertaken; increas-
ing the interest rate, ceteris paribus, is likely to reduce the level of planned investment spend-
ing. When the interest rate falls, it becomes less costly to borrow and more investment projects
are likely to be undertaken; reducing the interest rate, ceteris paribus, is likely to increase the
level of planned investment spending.
The relationship between the interest rate and planned investment is illustrated by the
downward-sloping demand curve in Figure 27.1. The higher the interest rate, the lower the level
of planned investment. At an interest rate of 3 percent, planned investment is I0. When the inter-
est rate rises from 3 to 6 percent, planned investment falls from I0 to I1. As the interest rate falls,
however, more projects become profitable, so more investment is undertaken. The curve in
Figure 27.1 is sometimes called the “marginal efficiency of investment” curve.
Other Determinants of Planned Investment
The assumption that planned investment depends only on the interest rate is obviously a simpli-
fication, just as is the assumption that consumption depends only on income. In practice, the
decision of a firm on how much to invest depends on, among other things, its expectation of
future sales. If a firm expects that its sales will increase in the future, it may begin to build up its
capital stock—that is, to invest—now so that it will be able to produce more in the future to meet
the increased level of sales. The optimism or pessimism of entrepreneurs about the future course
of the economy can have an important effect on current planned investment. Keynes used the
phrase animal spirits to describe the feelings of entrepreneurs, and he argued that these feelings
affect investment decisions.
We come back to this issue in Chapter 31, where we take a closer look at firm behavior (and
household behavior), but for now we will assume that planned investment simply depends on the
interest rate.

exchanged and in which the
equilibrium level of the interest

CHAPTER 27
Aggregate Demand in the Goods and Money Markets 543
Planned Aggregate Expenditure and the Interest Rate
We can use the fact that planned investment depends on the interest rate to consider how
planned aggregate expenditure (AE) depends on the interest rate. Recall that planned aggre-
gate expenditure is the sum of consumption, planned investment, and government purchases.
That is,
We now know that there are many possible levels of I, each corresponding to a different
interest rate. When the interest rate changes, planned investment changes. Therefore, a
change in the interest rate (r) will lead to a change in total planned spending (C + I + G)
as well.1
Figure 27.2 shows what happens to planned aggregate expenditure and output when the
interest rate rises from 3 percent to 6 percent. At the higher interest rate, planned investment is
lower; planned aggregate expenditure thus shifts downward. Recall from Chapters 23 and 24 that
a fall in any component of aggregate spending has an even larger (or “multiplier”) effect on equi-
librium income (Y). When the interest rate rises, planned investment (and planned aggregate
expenditure) falls and equilibrium output (income) falls by even more than the fall in planned
investment. In Figure 27.2, equilibrium Y falls from Y0 to Y1 when the interest rate rises from 
3 percent to 6 percent.
AE K C + I + G
1 When we look in detail in Chapter 31 at the behavior of households in the macroeconomy, we will see that consumption
spending (C) is also stimulated by lower interest rates and discouraged by higher interest rates.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Small Business and the Credit Crunch
In the text we described the way in which a firm’s investment decisions
depend on the interest rate. In the recession of 2008–2009 some
firms—especially small ones—were discouraged from investing, not
by high interest rates, but by the general unwillingness of banks to
lend them money at all. The article below describes the effect of the
so-called credit crunch (sometimes also called credit rationing) that
some have argued continued well into 2010.
Bailout Missed Main Street, New Report Says
The Wall Street Journal
Government funding to U.S. banks has done little to ease the
credit crunch for small businesses—and the situation doesn’t
seem to be improving, according to a new report.
The value of large banks’ loans to small businesses shrank
9% between 2008 and 2009, more than double the 4.1%
drop for overall lending, said a report released Thursday by
the Congressional Oversight Panel, a group set up to oversee
funds allocated by the federal government’s Troubled Asset
Relief Program.
“Big banks pulled back on everyone, but they pulled back
harder on small businesses,” said Elizabeth Warren, chair-
woman of the oversight panel, in a discussion with reporters.
The U.S. Treasury Department’s TARP programs, launched
during the depths of the financial meltdown, didn’t improve
access to credit, the report claims.
“Treasury never required banks to lend their new money,”
said Ms. Warren.
The oversight committee’s report said it’s unclear
whether lending has been constricted more by a lack of
lenders or a lack of borrowers. Businesses cautious about
piling on additional debt in the recession have been reluc-
tant to seek loans from banks, the report explained.
Meanwhile, underwriting standards at banks have tightened
so much that small businesses, which are considered to be
riskier investments, can’t squeeze through.
“Banks are lending less and less. What we hoped 
was 2009 was a trough, but lending is not springing back,” 
Ms. Warren said.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
We can summarize the effects of a change in the interest rate on the equilibrium level of out-
put. The effects of a change in the interest rate include:
 A high interest rate (r) discourages planned investment (I).
 Planned investment is a part of planned aggregate expenditure (AE).
 Thus, when the interest rate rises, planned aggregate expenditure (AE) at every level of
income falls.
 Finally, a decrease in planned aggregate expenditure lowers equilibrium output (income) (Y)
by a multiple of the initial decrease in planned investment.
Using a convenient shorthand:
Equilibrium in Both the Goods and Money
Markets: The IS-LM Model
It is now straightforward to see how the goods and money markets are linked.We have just seen that
an increase in the interest rate (r) decreases output (Y) in the goods market because an increase in r
lowers planned investment.A decrease in interest rates, conversely, raises output. This is the first link.
The second link can be seen in Figure 26.8 on p. 534. When income (Y) increases, this shifts
the money demand curve to the right, which increases the interest rate (r) with a fixed money
supply. We can thus write:
In other words, an increase in Y increases r in the money market and a decrease in Y decreases r.
Figure 27.3 summarizes the links between the two markets. Given this figure, we are essen-
tially done with the analysis. We have derived what is sometimes referred to as the “IS-LM”
model. Given the interest rate, the equilibrium level of output can be determined from the goods
market. Given output, the equilibrium interest rate can be determined from the money market.
Putting both markets together allows the one pair of equilibrium values of Y and r to be deter-
mined. The equilibrium value of Y is the value that is consistent with the equilibrium value of r.
There is equilibrium in both markets for the particular pair of values. In the Appendix to this
chapter the IS-LM model is formally set up and the overall equilibrium is derived.

CHAPTER 27
Aggregate Demand in the Goods and Money Markets 545
Policy Effects in the Goods and Money
Markets
A useful way to examine the links between the goods and money markets is to consider the effects
of changes in fiscal and monetary policy actions on the economy. We want to examine what hap-
pens to the equilibrium levels of output (Y) and interest rate (r) when policy changes. The three
policy variables are government spending (G), net taxes (T), and the money supply (MS).
Expansionary Policy Effects
Any government policy aimed at stimulating aggregate output (income) (Y) is said to be expan-
sionary. An expansionary fiscal policy is an increase in government spending (G) or a reduction
in net taxes (T) aimed at increasing aggregate output (income) (Y). An expansionary monetary
policy is an increase in the money supply aimed at increasing aggregate output (income) (Y).
Expansionary Fiscal Policy: An Increase in Government Purchases (G) or a
Decrease in Net Taxes (T)
As you know from Chapter 24, government purchases (G)
and net taxes (T) are the two tools of government fiscal policy. The government can stimulate the
economy—that is, it can increase aggregate output (income) (Y)—either by increasing govern-
ment purchases or by reducing net taxes. Although the impact of a tax cut is somewhat smaller
than the impact of an increase in G, both have a multiplier effect on the equilibrium level of Y.
Consider an increase in government purchases (G) of $10 billion. This increase in expen-
diture causes firms’ inventories to be smaller than planned. Unplanned inventory reductions
stimulate production, and firms increase output (Y). However, because added output means
added income, some of which is subsequently spent, consumption spending (C) also
increases. Again, inventories will be smaller than planned and output will rise even further.
The final equilibrium level of output is higher by a multiple of the initial increase in govern-
ment purchases.
This multiplier story is incomplete, however. Until this chapter, we have assumed that
planned investment (I) is fixed at a certain level, but we now know that planned investment
depends on the interest rate. We can now discuss what happens to the multiplier when invest-
ment varies because we have an understanding of the money market, in which the interest rate
is determined.
Return to our multiplier story at the point that firms first begin to raise output in response
to an increase in government purchases. As aggregate output (income) (Y) increases, an impact is
felt in the money market—the increase in income (Y) increases the demand for money (Md). (We
are assuming that the Fed holds the quantity of money supplied [Ms] constant.) The resulting
disequilibrium, with the quantity of money demanded greater than the quantity of money sup-
plied, causes the interest rate to rise. The increase in G increases both Y and r.
The increase in r has a side effect—a higher interest rate causes planned investment spending
(I) to decline. Because planned investment spending is a component of planned aggregate expendi-
ture (C + I + G), the decrease in I works against the increase in G.An increase in government spend-
ing (G) increases planned aggregate expenditure and increases aggregate output, but a decrease in
planned investment reduces planned aggregate expenditure and decreases aggregate output.
This tendency for increases in government spending to cause reductions in private invest-
ment spending is called the crowding-out effect. Without any expansion in the money supply to
accommodate the rise in income and increased money demand, planned investment spending is
partially crowded out by the higher interest rate. The extra spending created by the rise in
government purchases is somewhat offset by the fall in planned investment spending. Income

still rises, but the multiplier effect of the rise in G is lessened because of the higher interest rate’s
negative effect on planned investment.
This crowding-out effect is illustrated graphically in Figure 27.4. An increase in govern-
ment purchases from G0 to G1 shifts the planned aggregate expenditure curve (C + I0 + G0)
upward. The increase in (Y) from Y0 to Y1 causes the demand for money to rise, which
results in a disequilibrium in the money market. The excess demand for money raises the
interest rate, causing I to decrease from I0 to I1. The fall in I pulls the planned aggregate
expenditure curve back down, which lowers the equilibrium level of income to Y *.
(Remember that equilibrium is achieved when Y = AE.) The possibility of some crowding
out of firm investment by increased government spending is a subject of political debate as
well as economic analysis. To the extent that there is some crowding out, an increase in gov-
ernment spending as a way to increase aggregate output leads to a reduced share of private-
sector  (that is, firm) investment in GDP. There is considerable disagreement among voters
and politicians in the United States about what constitutes the right mix of private invest-
ment and public spending in a healthy economy.
Note that the size of the crowding-out effect and the ultimate size of the government
spending multiplier depend on several things. First, we assumed that the Fed did not change
the quantity of money supplied. If we were to assume instead that the Fed expanded the quan-
tity of money to accommodate the increase in G, the multiplier would be larger. In this case,
the higher demand for money would be satisfied with a higher quantity of money supplied and
the interest rate would not rise. Without a higher interest rate, there would be no crowding out.
Second, the crowding-out effect depends on the sensitivity or insensitivity of planned
investment spending to changes in the interest rate. Crowding out occurs because a higher inter-
est rate reduces planned investment spending. Investment depends on factors other than the
interest rate, however, and investment may at times be quite insensitive to changes in the interest
rate. If planned investment does not fall when the interest rate rises, there is no crowding-out
effect. These effects are summarized next.

Exactly the same reasoning holds for changes in net taxes. The ultimate effect of a tax cut on
the equilibrium level of output depends on how the money market reacts. The expansion of Y
that a tax cut brings about will lead to an increase in the interest rate and thus a decrease in

planned investment spending. The ultimate increase in Y will therefore be less than it would be if
the interest rate did not rise.
Expansionary Monetary Policy: An Increase in the Money Supply
Now let us
consider what will happen when the Fed decides to increase the supply of money through open
market operations. At first, open market operations inject new reserves into the system and
expand the quantity of money supplied (the money supply curve shifts to the right). Because the
quantity of money supplied is now greater than the amount households want to hold, the equi-
librium rate of interest falls. Planned investment spending (which is a component of planned
aggregate expenditure) increases when the interest rate falls.
Increased planned investment spending means planned aggregate expenditure is now
greater than aggregate output. Firms experience unplanned decreases in inventories, and
they raise output (Y). An increase in the money supply decreases the interest rate and
increases Y. However, the higher level of Y increases the demand for money (the demand for
money curve shifts to the right), which keeps the interest rate from falling as far as it other-
wise would.
If you review the sequence of events that follows the monetary expansion, you can see the
links between the injection of reserves by the Fed into the economy and the increase in output.
First, the increase in the quantity of money supplied pushes down the interest rate. Second, the
lower interest rate causes planned investment spending to rise. Third, the increased planned
investment spending means higher planned aggregate expenditure, which means increased out-
put as firms react to unplanned decreases in inventories. Fourth, the increase in output
(income) leads to an increase in the demand for money (the demand for money curve shifts to
the right), which means the interest rate decreases less than it would have if the demand for
money had not increased.
The power of monetary policy to affect the goods market depends on how much of a reac-
tion occurs at each link in this chain. Perhaps the most critical link is the link between r and I.
Monetary policy can be effective only if I reacts to changes in r.2 If firms sharply increase the
number of investment projects undertaken when the interest rate falls, expansionary monetary
policy works well at stimulating the economy. If, however, firms are reluctant to invest even at a
low interest rate, expansionary monetary policy will have limited success. In other words, the
effectiveness of monetary policy depends on the slope of the investment function. If it is nearly
vertical, indicating very little responsiveness of investment to the interest rate, the middle link in
this chain will be weak, rendering monetary policy ineffective.
Contractionary Policy Effects
Any government policy that is aimed at reducing aggregate output (income) (Y) is said to be
contractionary. Where expansionary policy is used to boost the economy, contractionary policy is
used to slow the economy.
Contractionary Fiscal Policy: A Decrease in Government Spending (G) or
an Increase in Net Taxes (T)
A contractionary fiscal policy is a decrease in govern-
ment spending (G) or an increase in net taxes (T) aimed at decreasing aggregate output
(income) (Y). The effects of this policy are the opposite of the effects of an expansionary fis-
cal policy.
A decrease in government purchases or an increase in net taxes leads to a decrease in
aggregate output (income) (Y), a decrease in the demand for money (Md), and a decrease in
contractionary fiscal policy

the interest rate (r). The decrease in Y that accompanies a contractionary fiscal policy is less
than it would be if we did not take the money market into account because the decrease in r
also causes planned investment (I) to increase. This increase in I offsets some of the decrease in
planned aggregate expenditure brought about by the decrease in G. (This also means the mul-
tiplier effect is smaller than it would be if we did not take the money market into account.) The
effects of a decrease in G, or an increase in T, can be represented as shown.

Contractionary Monetary Policy: A Decrease in the Money Supply
A
contractionary monetary policy is a decrease in the money supply aimed at decreasing aggregate
output (income) (Y). As you recall, the level of planned investment spending is a negative func-
tion of the interest rate: The higher the interest rate, the less planned investment there will be.
The less planned investment there is, the lower planned aggregate expenditure will be and the
lower the equilibrium level of output (income) (Y) will be. The lower equilibrium income results
in a decrease in the demand for money, which means that the increase in the interest rate will be
less than it would be if we did not take the goods market into account.

The Macroeconomic Policy Mix
Although we have been treating fiscal and monetary policy separately, it should be clear that fis-
cal and monetary policy can be used simultaneously. For example, both government purchases
(G) and the money supply (Ms) can be increased at the same time. We have seen that an increase
in G by itself raises both Y and r, while an increase in Ms by itself raises Y but lowers r. Therefore,
if the government wanted to increase Y without changing r, it could do so by increasing both G
and Ms by the appropriate amounts.
Policy mix refers to the combination of monetary and fiscal policies in use at a given time. A
policy mix that consists of a decrease in government spending and an increase in the money sup-
ply favors private investment spending over government spending. The reason is that both the
increased money supply and the fall in government purchases cause the interest rate to fall, which
leads to an increase in planned investment. The opposite is true for a mix that consists of an
expansionary fiscal policy and a contractionary monetary policy. This mix favors government
spending over investment spending. Such a policy has the effect of increasing government spend-
ing and reducing the money supply. Tight money and expanded government spending drives the
interest rate up and planned investment down.
There is no rule about what constitutes the “best” policy mix or the “best” composition of
output. On this issue, as on many other issues, economists (and others) disagree. In part, some-
one’s preference for a certain composition of output—say, one weighted heavily toward private
spending with relatively little government spending—depends on how that person stands on
such issues as the proper role of government in the economy.
Table 27.1 summarizes the effects of various combinations of policies on several important
macroeconomic variables. If you can explain the reasoning underlying each of the effects shown
in the table, you can be satisfied that you have a good understanding of the links between the
goods market and the money market.

The Aggregate Demand (AD) Curve
As we noted at the beginning of this chapter, the aggregate price level P is not determined in this
chapter.This must wait until the next chapter.In fact, P has not even been mentioned in the previous
analysis. Where does P fit in? We need to go back to the demand for money curve in Figure 26.8
on p. 534. In this graph if PY increases, the money demand curve shifts to the right, which
increases the interest rate. In the previous analysis we used this graph by noting that if
Y increases, the money demand curve shifts to the right, which increases the interest rate—and
conversely if Y decreases. Thus, in Figure 27.3 on p. 545 we note that money demand depends on
Y. Remember that in the money demand model in Chapter 26, the demand for money depends
on nominal income (and the interest rate). If real income (Y) increases and the price level (P) is
fixed, then obviously nominal income (PY) increases. So an increase in Y, with P fixed, shifts the
money demand curve to the right, which increases the interest rate. This is all we have used so far.
The next step is to ask what happens if P changes, and this is clear. If P increases, the money
demand curve shifts to the right, which increases the interest rate. This is just like a Y increase.
Nominal income can increase because real income increases or because the price level increases, and
an increase in nominal income shifts the money demand curve to the right and increases the inter-
est rate. The increase in the interest rate that results from an increase in P leads to a fall in planned
investment; so in the new equilibrium, Y is lower. Conversely, if P decreases, the money demand
curve shifts to the left, which decreases the interest rate, which increases planned investment, which
results in a higher equilibrium value of Y. There is thus a negative relationship between the price
level P and real aggregate output (income) Y. This relationship is called the aggregate demand
(AD) curve, shown in Figure 27.6. This analysis is spelled out in Figure 27.5.
It is important to be clear on what we have done. We have taken the policy variables G, T, and
MS to be fixed. Given particular values of the policy variables and given a particular value of P, we
can determine the equilibrium values of Y and r (as well as C and I). These values correspond to
equilibrium in the goods market and the money market for the given value of P and the values of
the policy variables. Now we change P but leave the policy variables unchanged, and we determine
new equilibrium values of r and Y. Thus for each value of P we can get an equilibrium value of Y,
and the AD curve is just a plot of these values. Each point on the AD curve corresponds to equilib-
rium in the goods market and the money market for the given value of P. Remember, we are not
determining P. We are just plotting equilibrium values of Y for given values of P.
The Aggregate Demand Curve: A Warning
It is important that you realize what the aggregate demand curve represents. The aggregate
demand curve is more complex than a simple individual or market demand curve. The AD curve
is not a market demand curve, and it is not the sum of all market demand curves in the economy.

the AD curve is a point at
which both the goods market
and the money market are 
in equilibrium.

550
PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
To understand why, recall the logic behind a simple downward-sloping household demand curve.
A demand curve shows the quantity of output demanded (by an individual household or in a sin-
gle market) at every possible price, ceteris paribus. In drawing a simple demand curve, we are
assuming that other prices and income are fixed. From these assumptions, it follows that one rea-
son the quantity demanded of a particular good falls when its price rises is that other prices do
not rise. The good in question therefore becomes more expensive relative to other goods, and
households respond by substituting other goods for the good whose price increased. In addition,
if income does not rise when the price of a good does, real income falls. This may also lead to a
lower quantity demanded of the good whose price has risen.
Things are different when the overall price level rises. When the overall price level rises many
prices—including many wage rates (many people’s income)—rise together. For this reason, we
cannot use the ceteris paribus assumption to draw the AD curve. The logic that explains why a
simple demand curve slopes downward fails to explain why the AD curve also has a negative
slope. Aggregate demand falls when the price level increases because the higher price level causes
the demand for money (Md) to rise. With the money supply constant, the interest rate will rise to

Aggregate Demand in the Goods and Money Markets 551
reestablish equilibrium in the money market. It is the higher interest rate that causes aggregate
output to fall. The AD curve traces the relationship between the overall price level and aggregate
demand, taking into account the behavior of firms and households in the goods and money mar-
kets at the same time.
You do not need to understand anything about the money market to understand a simple
individual or market demand curve. However, to understand what the aggregate demand curve
represents, you must understand the interaction between the goods market and the money mar-
kets, namely the analysis summarized in Figure 27.5.
Other Reasons for a Downward-Sloping Aggregate
Demand Curve
In addition to the effects of money supply and money demand on the interest rate, two other fac-
tors lie behind the downward slope of the AD curve. These are the consumption link and the real
wealth effect.
The Consumption Link
We noted in Chapter 22 (and will discuss in detail in 
Chapter 31) that consumption (C) also depends on the interest rate. Other things being equal,
consumption expenditures tend to rise when the interest rate falls and to fall when the interest
rate rises—just as planned investment does. This tendency is another link between the goods
market and the money market. If something happens to change the interest rate in the money
market, both consumption and planned investment are affected in the goods market.
The consumption link provides another reason for the AD curve’s downward slope. An increase
in the price level increases the demand for money, which leads to an increase in the interest rate,
which leads to a decrease in consumption (as well as planned investment), which leads to a decrease
in aggregate output (income). The initial decrease in consumption (brought about by the increase in
the interest rate) contributes to the overall decrease in output. Planned investment does not bear all
the burden of providing the link from a higher interest rate to a lower level of aggregate output.
Decreased consumption brought about by a higher interest rate also contributes to this effect.
The Real Wealth Effect
We also noted in Chapter 23 (and will discuss in detail in
Chapter 31 that consumption depends on wealth. Other things being equal, the more wealth
households have, the more they consume. Wealth includes holdings of money, shares of stock,
bonds, and housing, among other things. If household wealth decreases, the result will be less
consumption now and in the future.
The price level has an effect on some kinds of wealth. Suppose you are holding $1,000 in a
checking account or in a money market fund and the price level rises by 10 percent. Your holding
is now worth 10 percent less because the prices of the goods that you could buy with your $1,000
have all increased by 10 percent. The purchasing power (or “real value”) of your holding has
decreased by 10 percent.
An increase in the price level may also lower the real value of stocks and housing, although
whether it does depends on what happens to stock prices and housing prices when the overall price
level rises. If stock prices and housing prices rise by the same percentage as the overall price level, the
real value of stocks and housing will remain unchanged. If an increase in the price level does lower
the real value of wealth, this is another reason for the downward slope of the AD curve. If real wealth
falls, this leads to a decrease in consumption, which leads to a decrease in aggregate output (income).
So if real wealth falls when there is an increase in the price level, there is a negative relationship
between the price level and output through this real wealth effect or real balance effect.
Shifts of the Aggregate Demand Curve from Policy Variables
We have already seen in this chapter how the three policy variables G, T, and MS affect the equi-
librium value of Y. It will be useful for purposes of the next chapter to show how these variables
affect the AD curve. We have seen that when MS increases, the interest rate falls and Y increases.
Thus for a fixed P an increase in MS leads to a larger value of Y, which is a shift of the AD curve to
the right. This is shown in Figure 27.7. We have also seen that when G increases or T decreases, Y
increases. Thus for a fixed P an increase in G or a decrease in T leads to a larger value of Y, which
is a shift of the AD curve to the right. This is shown in Figure 27.8.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
The same reasoning applies to a decrease in MS, a decrease in G, and an increase in T. All
these shift the AD curve to the left. Figure 27.9 summarizes the ways the AD curve shifts in
response to changes in MS, G, and T.
There is a danger when analyzing shifts of the AD curve to forget what is behind them.
For example, a shift to the right due to an increase in MS has a lower interest rate associated
with it, whereas a shift to the right due to an increase in G or a decrease in T has a higher
interest rate associated with it. To see the complete picture you need to go back to the earlier
analysis in this chapter. The AD curve is derived from the complete analysis, but it does not
explicitly show all the details.

The Effect of an Increase in Money Supply on the AD Curve
An increase in the money supply (Ms) causes the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right, from AD0 to
AD1. This shift occurs because the increase in Ms lowers the interest rate, which increases planned invest-
ment (and thus planned aggregate expenditure). The final result is an increase in output at each possible
price level.

An increase in government purchases (G) or a decrease in net taxes (T) causes the aggregate demand curve to
shift to the right, from AD0 to AD1. The increase in G increases planned aggregate expenditure, which leads
to an increase in output at each possible price level. A decrease in T causes consumption to rise. The higher
consumption then increases planned aggregate expenditure, which leads to an increase in output at each
possible price level.

Looking Ahead: Determining the Price Level
Our discussion of aggregate output (income) and the interest rate in the goods and money mar-
kets is now complete. You should have a good understanding of how the two markets work
together. The AD curve is a useful summary of this analysis in that every point on the curve cor-
responds to equilibrium in both the goods and money markets for the given value of the price
level. We have not yet, however, determined the price level. This is the task of the next chapter.
S U M M A R Y
1. The goods market and the money market do not operate
independently. Events in the money market have effects on
the goods market, and events in the goods market have
effects on the money market.
PLANNED INVESTMENT AND THE INTEREST
RATE p. 542
2. There is a negative relationship between planned investment
and the interest rate because the interest rate affects the cost
of investment projects. When the interest rate rises, planned
investment decreases, and when the interest rate falls,
planned investment increases.
3. For every value of the interest rate, there is a different level of
planned investment spending and a different equilibrium
level of output.
EQUILIBRIUM IN BOTH THE GOODS AND MONEY
MARKETS: THE IS-LM MODEL p. 544 
4. In the goods market, there is a negative relationship between
the interest rate and output because there is a negative rela-
tionship between the interest rate and planned investment.
In the money market, there is a positive relationship between
the interest rate and output for a fixed money supply
because if output increases, the interest rate must increase to
achieve equilibrium in the money market.
5. Combining the goods and money markets determines the
equilibrium values of both the interest rate and output.
POLICY EFFECTS IN THE GOODS AND MONEY
MARKETS p. 545 
6. An expansionary fiscal policy is an increase in government
spending (G) or a reduction in net taxes (T) aimed at increas-
ing aggregate output (income) (Y). An expansionary fiscal pol-
icy based on increases in government spending tends to lead to
a crowding-out effect: Because increased government expendi-
tures mean more transactions in the economy and thus an
increased demand for money, the interest rate will rise. The
decrease in planned investment spending that accompanies the
higher interest rate will then partially offset the increase in
aggregate expenditures brought about by the increase in G.
7. The size of the crowding-out effect, affecting the size of the
government spending multiplier, depends on two things: the
assumption that the Fed does not change the quantity of
money supplied and the sensitivity or insensitivity of planned
investment to changes in the interest rate.
8. An expansionary monetary policy is an increase in the money
supply aimed at increasing aggregate output (income) (Y).
An increase in the money supply leads to a lower interest
rate, increased planned investment, increased planned aggre-
gate expenditure, and ultimately a higher equilibrium level
of aggregate output (income) (Y). Expansionary policies
have been used to lift the economy out of recessions.
9. A contractionary fiscal policy is a decrease in government
spending or an increase in net taxes aimed at decreasing
aggregate output (income) (Y). A decrease in government
spending or an increase in net taxes leads to a decrease in
aggregate output (income) (Y), a decrease in the demand for
money, and a decrease in the interest rate. However, the
decrease in Y is somewhat offset by the additional planned
investment resulting from the lower interest rate.
10. A contractionary monetary policy is a decrease in the money
supply aimed at decreasing aggregate output (income) (Y).
The higher interest rate brought about by the reduced
money supply causes a decrease in planned investment
spending and a lower level of equilibrium output. However,
the lower equilibrium level of output brings about a decrease
in the demand for money, which means the increase in the
interest rate will be less than it would be if we did not take
the goods market into account. Contractionary policies have
been used to fight inflation.
11. The policy mix is the combination of monetary and fiscal
policies in use at a given time. There is no rule about what
constitutes the best policy mix or the best composition of
output. In part, one’s preference for a certain composition of
output depends on one’s stance concerning such issues as
the proper role of government in the economy.

1. On June 5, 2003, the European Central Bank acted to decrease
the short-term interest rate in Europe by half a percentage
point, to 2 percent. The bank’s president at the time, Willem
Duisenberg, suggested that, in the future, the bank could reduce
rates further. The rate cut was made because European coun-
tries were growing very slowly or were in recession. What effect
did the bank hope the action would have on the economy? Be
specific. What was the hoped-for result on C, I, and Y?
2. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 543] In response to
concerns of both the Treasury Department and the Congressional
Oversight Panel regarding the value of loans being made to small
businesses, the four largest U.S. banks (Bank of America,
Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) all agreed to
increase their small business lending practices in 2010. Search the
Internet and describe any changes that have occurred in lending
to small businesses since 2010. The text states that it is unclear
whether the reduced lending is due more to a lack of lenders or a
lack of borrowers. Go to www.sba.gov/advo/research and click on
“Small Business Indicators.” Select the most recent quarter from
the quarterly indicator menu and describe what happened to
demand for commercial and industrial loans as well as the level of
optimism for small businesses. What correlation do you see
between the changes in lending, the demand for loans, and the
level of optimism for small businesses? 
3. During the third quarter of 1997, Japanese GDP was falling at
an annual rate of over 11 percent. Many blamed the big increase
in Japan’s taxes in the spring of 1997, which was designed to bal-
ance the budget. Explain how an increase in taxes with the econ-
omy growing slowly could precipitate a recession. Do not skip
steps in your answer. If you were head of the Japanese central
bank, how would you respond? What impact would your policy
have on the level of investment?
4. Some economists argue that the “animal spirits” of investors are
so important in determining the level of investment in the econ-
omy that interest rates do not matter at all. Suppose that this
were true—that investment in no way depends on interest rates.
a. How would Figure 27.1 be different?
b. What would happen to the level of planned aggregate expen-
ditures if the interest rate changed?
c. What would be different about the relative effectiveness of
monetary and fiscal policy?
5. For each of the following scenarios, tell a story and predict the
effects on the equilibrium levels of aggregate output (Y) and the
interest rate (r):
a. During 2005, the Federal Reserve was tightening monetary
policy in an attempt to slow the economy. Congress passed a
substantial cut in the individual income tax at the same time.
b. During the summer of 2003, Congress passed and President
George W. Bush signed the third tax cut in 3 years. Many of
the tax cuts took effect in 2005. Assume that the Fed holds
Ms fixed.
c. In 1993, the government raised taxes. At the same time, the
Fed was pursuing an expansionary monetary policy.
d. In 2005, conditions in Iraq led to a sharp drop in consumer
confidence and a drop in consumption. Assume that the Fed
holds the money supply constant.
e. The Fed attempts to increase the money supply to stimulate
the economy, but plants are operating at 65 percent of their
capacities and businesses are pessimistic about the future.
6. Occasionally, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
sets a policy designed to “track” the interest rate. This means
that the FOMC is pursuing policies designed to keep the interest
rate constant. If, in fact, the Fed were acting to counter any
increases or decreases in the interest rate to keep it constant,
what specific actions would you expect to see the Fed take if the
following were to occur? (In answering, indicate the effects of
each set of events on Y, C, S, I, Ms, Md, and r.)
a. An unexpected increase in investor confidence leads to a
sharp increase in orders for new plants and equipment.
b. A major New York bank fails, causing a number of worried peo-
ple (not trusting even the FDIC) to withdraw a substantial
amount of cash from other banks and put it in their cookie jars.
THE AGGREGATE DEMAND (AD) CURVE p. 549 
12. The aggregate demand (AD) curve graphs the negative rela-
tionship between aggregate output (income) and the price
level. Each point on the AD curve is a point at which both
the goods market and the money market are in equilibrium
for a given value of the price level. The AD curve is not the
sum of all the market demand curves in the economy.
13. An increase in the quantity of money supplied, an increase
in government purchases, or a decrease in net taxes at a
given price level shifts the aggregate demand curve to the
right. A decrease in the quantity of money supplied, a
decrease in government purchases, or an increase in net
taxes shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left.

7. Paranoia, the largest country in central Antarctica, receives word
of an imminent penguin attack. The news causes expectations
about the future to be shaken. As a consequence, there is a sharp
decline in investment spending plans.
a. Explain in detail the effects of such an event on the economy
of Paranoia assuming no response on the part of the central
bank or the Treasury. (Ms, T, and G all remain constant.)
Make sure you discuss the adjustments in the goods market
and the money market.
b. To counter the fall in investment, the king of Paranoia calls
for a proposal to increase government spending. To finance
the program, the chancellor of the exchequer has proposed
three alternative options:
(1)
Finance the expenditures with an equal increase in taxes
(2)
Keep tax revenues constant and borrow the money
from the public by issuing new government bonds
(3)
Keep taxes constant and finance the expenditures by
printing new money
Consider the three financing options and rank them from most
expansionary to least expansionary. Explain your ranking.
8. Why might investment not respond positively to low interest
rates during a recession? Why might investment not respond
negatively to high interest rates during a boom?
9. The aggregate demand curve slopes downward because when
the price level is lower, people can afford to buy more and
aggregate demand rises. When prices rise, people can afford to
buy less and aggregate demand falls. Is this a good explanation
of the shape of the AD curve? Why or why not?
10. By late summer 2010, the target fed funds rate was between zero
and 0.25 percent. At the same time,“animal spirits” were dor-
mant and there was excess capacity in most industries. That is,
businesses were in no mood to build new plant and equipment
if they were not using their already existing capital. Interest rates
were at or near zero, and yet investment demand remained quite
low. The unemployment rate was 9.6 percent in August 2010.
These conditions suggest that monetary policy is likely to be a
more effective tool to promote expansion than fiscal policy. Do
you agree or disagree? Explain your answer.
11. Describe the policy mix that would result in each of the follow-
ing situations.
a. The interest rate decreases, investment increases, and the
change in aggregate output is indeterminate.
b. Aggregate output increases, and the interest rate change is
indeterminate.
c. The interest rate increases, investment decreases, and the
change in aggregate output is indeterminate.
d. Aggregate output decreases, and the interest rate change 
is indeterminate.
12. In the first few chapters of this book, we introduced the
notion of supply and demand. One of the first things we did
was to derive the relationship between the price of a product
and the quantity demanded per time period by an individual
household. Now we have derived what is called the aggregate
demand curve. The two look the same and both seem to have
a negative slope, but the logic is completely different. Tell one
story that explains the negative slope of a simple demand
curve and another story that explains the more complex
aggregate demand curve (AD).
13. Expansionary policies are designed to stimulate the economy by
increasing aggregate output. Explain why expansionary fiscal
policy and expansionary monetary policy have opposite effects
on the interest rate despite having the same goal of increasing
aggregate output. Illustrate your answer with graphs of the
money market.
14. Explain the effect, if any, that each of the following occurrences
should have on the aggregate demand curve.
a. The Fed lowers the discount rate.
b. The price level decreases.
c. The federal government increases federal income tax rates in
an effort to reduce the federal deficit.
d. Pessimistic firms decrease investment spending.
e. The inflation rate falls by 3 percent.
f. The federal government increases purchases to stimulate
the economy.
CHAPTER 27 APPENDIX
The IS-LM Model
There is a useful way of depicting graphically the determination
of aggregate output (income) and the interest rate in the goods
and money markets. Two curves are involved in this diagram, the
IS curve and the LM curve. In this Appendix, we will derive these
two curves and use them to see how changes in government pur-
chases (G) and the money supply (Ms) affect the equilibrium val-
ues of aggregate output (income) and the interest rate.The effects
we describe here are the same as the effects we described in the
main text; here we illustrate the effects graphically.
The IS Curve
We know that in the goods market there is an equilibrium
level of aggregate output (income) (Y) for each value of the
interest rate (r). For a given value of r, we can determine the
equilibrium value of Y. The equilibrium value of Y falls
when r rises and rises when r falls. There is thus a negative
relationship between the equilibrium value of Y and r. The
reason for this negative relationship is the negative relation-
ship between planned investment and the interest rate.
When the interest rate rises, planned investment (I) falls,
and this decrease in I leads to a decrease in the equilibrium
value of Y. The negative relationship between the equilib-
rium value of Y and r is shown in Figure 27A.1. This curve is
called the IS curve.1 Each point on the IS curve represents
the equilibrium point in the goods market for the given
interest rate.
1 The letter I stands for investment, and the letter S stands for saving. IS refers to
the fact that in equilibrium in the goods market, planned investment equals saving.

 FIGURE 27A.1 The IS Curve
Each point on the IS curve corresponds to the equilibrium point in the
goods market for the given interest rate. When government spending
(G) increases, the IS curve shifts to the right, from IS0 to IS1.
We also know from our earlier analysis of the goods market
that when government purchases (G) increase with a constant
interest rate, the equilibrium value of Y increases. This means
the IS curve shifts to the right when G increases. With the same
value of r and a higher value of G, the equilibrium value of Y is
larger; when G decreases, the IS curve shifts to the left.
The LM Curve
In the money market, there is an equilibrium value of the
interest rate (r) for every value of aggregate output (income)
(Y). The equilibrium value of r is determined at the point at
which the quantity of money demanded equals the quantity of
money supplied. For a given value of Y, we can determine the
equilibrium value of r in the money market. We also know
from Figure 27.5 that the equilibrium value of r rises when 
Y rises and falls when Y falls—a positive relationship between
the equilibrium value of r and Y. The reason for this positive
relationship is the positive relationship between the demand
for money and Y. When Y increases, the demand for money
increases because more money is demanded for the increased
volume of transactions in the economy. An increase in the
demand for money increases the equilibrium value of r—thus
the positive relationship between the equilibrium value of
r and Y.
The positive relationship between the equilibrium value
of r and Y is shown in Figure 27A.2. This curve is called the
LM curve.2 Each point on the LM curve represents equilib-
rium in the money market for the given value of aggregate
output (income).
We also know from our analysis of the money market that
when the money supply (Ms) increases with a constant level of
Y, the equilibrium value of r decreases. As Figure 27A.2 shows,
this means that the LM curve shifts to the right when Ms
increases. With the same value of Y and a higher value of Ms,
the equilibrium value of r is lower. When Ms decreases, the LM
curve shifts to the left.
The IS-LM Diagram
Figure 27A.3 shows the IS and LM curves together on one
graph. The point at which the two curves intersect is the point
at which equilibrium exists in both the goods market and the
money market. There is equilibrium in the goods market
because the point is on the IS curve, and there is equilibrium in
the money market because the point is on the LM curve.
We now have only two tasks left. The first is to see how
the equilibrium values of Y and r are affected by changes in
G—fiscal policy. This is easy. We have just seen that an
increase in G shifts the IS curve to the right. Thus, an
increase in G leads to higher equilibrium values of Y and r.
This situation is illustrated in Figure 27A.4. Conversely, a

aggregate output (income) and the interest rate through shifts
in the two curves. Always keep in mind the economic theory
that lies behind the two curves. Do not memorize what curve
shifts when; be able to understand and explain why the curves
shift. This means going back to the behavior of households and
firms in the goods and money markets.
It is easy to use the IS-LM diagram to see how there can
be a monetary and fiscal policy mix that leads to, say, an
increase in aggregate output (income) but no increase in the
interest rate. If both G and Ms increase, both curves shift to
the right and the shifts can be controlled in such a way as to
bring about no change in the equilibrium value of the inter-
est rate.

decrease in G leads to lower equilibrium values of Y and r
because the lower level of G causes the IS curve to shift to the
left. (The effects are similar for changes in net taxes, T.)
Our second task is to see how the equilibrium values of Y and
r are affected by changes in Ms—monetary policy.This is also easy.
We have just seen that an increase in Ms shifts the LM curve to the
right. Thus, an increase in Ms leads to a higher equilibrium value
of Y and a lower equilibrium value of r. This is illustrated in
Figure 27A.5.Conversely,a decrease in Ms leads to a lower equilib-
rium value of Y and a higher equilibrium value of r because a
decreased money supply causes the LM curve to shift to the left.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
559
Aggregate Supply
and the Equilibrium
Price Level
In 2009, the U.S. Consumer Price
Index showed negative inflation. In
2010 inflation had risen to about a 
2 percent annual rate, still well below
historical levels. Nevertheless, at least
one member of the Federal Reserve’s
Board of
Governors,
Thomas
Hoenig of Kansas City, remained
concerned about the prospects of
future inflation. In a speech about
the need to reduce the stimulus bill,
Hoenig argued, “I think we risk a
very serious inflationary problem with new bubbles that could be created.”What causes an increase in
a country’s overall price level, and why might Hoenig and other observers be worried? What tools do
the Fed and the administration have to try to control inflation? These are the subjects of this chapter.
The determination of the overall price level in an economy is one of the central issues in
macroeconomics. Inflation—an increase in the overall price level—is one of the key concerns of
macroeconomists and government policy makers. In Chapter 22, we discussed how inflation is
measured and the costs of inflation, but made no mention of the causes of inflation. For simplicity,
our analysis in Chapters 23 through 27 took the price level as fixed. This allowed us to discuss the
links between the goods market and the money market without the complication of a changing
price level. Having considered how the two markets work, we are ready to take up flexible prices.
We derived the aggregate demand curve in Chapter 27. The first step in this chapter is to
introduce the aggregate supply curve. Given the aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves,
the equilibrium price level is just the intersection of the two curves. Once the equilibrium price
level is determined, we can examine how fiscal and monetary policies affect the price level.
The Aggregate Supply Curve
Aggregate supply is the total supply of goods and services in an economy. Although there is lit-
tle disagreement among economists about how the aggregate demand curve is derived, there is a
great deal of disagreement about how the aggregate supply curve is derived. Differences among
economists regarding the shape of the aggregate supply curve is one important factor giving rise
to differences in policies they suggest to deal with macroeconomic problems such as inflation and
unemployment.
The Aggregate Supply Curve: A Warning
The aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the relationship between the aggregate quantity of out-
put supplied by all the firms in an economy and the overall price level. To understand the aggre-
gate supply curve, we need to understand something about the behavior of the individual firms
that make up the economy.

The Short-Run
Aggregate Supply Curve
In the short run, the aggregate
supply curve (the price/output
response curve) has a positive
slope. At low levels of aggregate
output, the curve is fairly flat. As
the economy approaches capac-
ity, the curve becomes nearly ver-
tical. At capacity, Y*, the curve
is vertical.
It may seem logical to derive the aggregate supply curve by adding together the supply curves of
all the individual firms in the economy. However, the logic behind the relationship between the over-
all price level in the economy and the level of aggregate output (income)—that is, the AS curve—is
very different from the logic behind an individual firm’s supply curve. The aggregate supply curve is
not a market supply curve,and it is not the simple sum of all the individual supply curves in the econ-
omy.(Recall a similar warning for the aggregate demand curve in the last chapter.) The reason is that
many firms (some would argue most firms) do not simply respond to prices determined in the
market.Instead,they actually set prices.Only in perfectly competitive markets do firms simply react
to prices determined by market forces. Firms in other kinds of industries (imperfectly competitive
industries) make both output and price decisions based on their perceptions of demand and costs.
Price-setting firms do not have individual supply curves because these firms are choosing both out-
put and price at the same time.To derive an individual supply curve,we need to imagine calling out
a price to a firm and having the firm tell us how much output it will supply at that price.We cannot
do this if firms are also setting prices. If supply curves do not exist for imperfectly competitive
firms, we certainly cannot add them together to get an aggregate supply curve!
What can we say about the relationship between aggregate output and the overall price level?
Because many firms in the economy set prices as well as output, it is clear that an “aggregate sup-
ply curve” in the traditional sense of the word supply does not exist. What does exist is what we
might call a “price/output response” curve—a curve that traces out the price decisions and out-
put decisions of all firms in the economy under a given set of circumstances.
What might such a curve look like?
Aggregate Supply in the Short Run
Many argue that the aggregate supply curve (or the price/output response curve) has a positive
slope, at least in the short run. (We will discuss the short-run/long-run distinction in more detail
later in this chapter.) In addition, many argue that at very low levels of aggregate output—for
example, when the economy is in a recession—the aggregate supply curve is fairly flat and that at
high levels of output—for example, when the economy is experiencing a boom—it is vertical or
nearly vertical. Such a curve is shown in Figure 28.1.
Why an Upward Slope?
Why might a higher price level be associated with more output,
giving the AS curve a positive slope? Remember when we talk about the aggregate price level, we are
talking about not only output prices but also prices of inputs, including the price of labor, or wages.
If the only thing happening is that all prices, including wages, are increasing at the same rate, then it
is plausible to think that there would be no output response. As prices rise, firms get more for
their products and pay proportionately more for workers. The AS curve would be vertical. On the

other hand,if wages and prices do not move at the same time,if wages are “sticky,”then the AS curve
may have a positive slope.
Consider the case in which there is an increase in aggregate demand and assume that firms in
the economy are imperfectly competitive. The increase in aggregate demand shifts the demand
curves facing individual firms out. If the firms’ wages do not also increase, then firms can increase
their profits by raising prices and increasing output.1 In other words, the response of the overall
economy to the aggregate demand increase will be an increase in output and the price level—a
positive slope of the short-run AS curve.
A key assumption in this story is that firms’ wages and thus their marginal cost curves do not
also shift. A key input into the production processes of firms is labor, and labor costs are a large
fraction of total costs. If wages do not respond quickly to price increases, there may be some
period of time in which firms raise prices without seeing wage rates rise. In practice, wages do
tend to lag behind prices. We discuss in the next chapter various reasons that have been advanced
for why wages might be “sticky” in the short run. If wages are sticky in the short run in the sense
that wages lag behind prices, this is a reason for an upward-sloping short-run AS curve. Firms’
demand curves will shift without a corresponding shift in their marginal cost curves.
We should add a word of caution at this point. It may be that some of a firm’s input costs are
rising even in the short run after the aggregate demand increase has taken place because some of
a firm’s inputs may be purchased from other firms who are raising prices. For example, one input
to a Dell computer is a chip produced by Intel or AMD. The fact that some of a firm’s input costs
rise along with a shift in the demand for its product complicates the picture because it means that
at the same time there is an outward shift in a firm’s demand curve, there is some upward shift in
its marginal cost curve. In deriving an upward-sloping AS curve, we are in effect assuming that
these kinds of input costs are small relative to wage costs. So the story is that wages are a large
fraction of total costs and that wage changes lag behind price changes. This gives us an upward-
sloping short-run AS curve.
Why the Particular Shape?
Notice the AS curve in Figure 28.1 begins with a flat section
and ends with a more or less vertical section. Why might the AS curve have this shape? Consider
the vertical portion first. At some level the overall economy is using all its capital and all the labor
that wants to work at the market wage. At this level (Y*), increased demand for output can be met
only by increased prices and similarly for increased demand for labor. Neither wages nor prices
are likely to be sticky at this level of economic activity.
What about the flat portion of the curve? Here we are at levels of output that are low relative
to historical levels. Many firms are likely to have excess capacity in terms of their plant and equip-
ment and their workforce. With excess capacity, firms may be able to increase output from A to
B without a proportionate cost increase. (In later chapters we will see that labor productivity usu-
ally increases following a recession.) Small price increases may thus be associated with relatively
large output responses. We may also observe relatively sticky wages upward at this point on the
AS curve if firms have held any excess workers in the downturn as a way to preserve worker morale.
Shifts of the Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve
Think now about shifts of the AS curve. A rightward shift in the AS curve indicates that
society can get a larger aggregate output at a given price level. What might cause such a shift?
Clearly, if a society had an increase in labor or capital, the AS curve would shift to the right.
In either case, the marginal costs of production in the society would fall as more inputs were
available at given input prices to produce output. Similarly, technical changes that increased
productivity would also shift the AS curve to the right by lowering marginal costs of
production in the economy. Recall that the vertical part of the short-run AS curve represents
the economy’s maximum (capacity) output. This maximum output is determined by the
1 This is a standard result in microeconomics. An outward demand shift for an imperfectively competitive firm with an
unchanged marginal cost curve leads the firm to raise its price and its quantity produced. In the perfectly competitive case the
industry output price is determined in the market, and firms take this price as given in deciding how much output to produce. If
aggregate demand increases and results in a larger industry output price and if there is no increase in firms’ costs, they will
respond by increasing output. There will thus be an increase in both industry output prices and output, resulting in a positive
sloping short-run AS curve.

economy’s existing resources, like the size of its labor force, capital stock, and the current state of
technology. The labor force grows naturally with an increase in the working-age population, but
it can also increase for other reasons. Since the 1960s, for example, the percentage of women in
the labor force has grown sharply. This increase in the supply of women workers has shifted the
AS curve to the right. Immigration can also shift the AS curve. During the 1970s, Germany, faced
with a serious labor shortage, opened its borders to large numbers of “guest workers,” largely
from Turkey. The United States has experienced significant immigration, legal and illegal, from
Mexico, from Central and South American countries, and from Asia. (We discuss economic
growth in more detail in Chapter 32.) 
We have focused on labor and capital as factors of production, but for a modern economy,
energy is also an important input. New discoveries of oil or problems in the production of
energy can also shift the AS curve through effects on the marginal cost of production in many
parts of the economy.
Figures 28.2(a) and (b) show the effects of shifts in the short-run AS curve coming from
changes in wage rates or energy prices. This type of shift is sometimes called a cost shock or supply
shock. Oil has historically had quite volatile prices and has often been thought to contribute to
shifts in the AS curve that, as we will shortly see, contribute to economy-wide fluctuations.

The Equilibrium Price Level
The equilibrium price level in the economy occurs at the point at which the AD curve and the AS
curve intersect, shown in Figure 28.3, where the equilibrium price level is P0 and the equilibrium
level of aggregate output (income) is Y0.
Figure 28.3 looks simple, but it is a powerful device for analyzing a number of macro-
economic questions. Consider first what is true at the intersection of the AS and AD curves. Each
point on the AD curve corresponds to equilibrium in both the goods market and the money mar-
ket. Each point on the AS curve represents the price/output responses of all the firms in the econ-
omy. That means that the point at which the AS and AD curves intersect corresponds to
equilibrium in the goods and money markets and to a set of price/output decisions on the part of
all the firms in the economy.
We will use this AS/AD framework to analyze the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on the
economy and to analyze the causes of inflation. For example, what can Trichet and Bernanke do

if they are worried about inflation? To answer these kinds of questions, we need to return to the
AS curve and discuss its shape in the long run.
The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve
We derived the short-run AS curve under the assumption that wages were sticky. This does
not mean, however, that stickiness persists forever. Over time, wages adjust to higher prices.
When workers negotiate with firms over their wages, they take into account what prices have
been doing in the recent past. If wages fully adjust to prices in the long run, then the long-run
AS curve will be vertical. We can see why in Figure 28.4. Initially, the economy is in equilib-
rium at a price level of P0 and aggregate output of Y0 (the point A at which AD0 and AS0 inter-
sect). Now imagine a shift of the AD curve from AD0 to AD1. In response to this shift, both the
price level and aggregate output rise in the short run, to P1 and Y1, respectively (the point B at
which AD1 and AS0 intersect). The movement along the upward-sloping AS0 curve as 
Y increases from Y0 to Y1 assumes that wages lag prices.
Now, as wages increase the short-run AS curve shifts to the left. If wages fully adjust, the AS
curve will over time have shifted from AS0 to AS1 in Figure 28.4, and output will be back to Y0
(the point C at which AD1 and AS1 intersect). So when wages fully adjust to prices, the long-run
AS curve is vertical.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
The Simple “Keynesian” Aggregate Supply Curve
There is a great deal of disagreement concerning the shape of
the AS curve. One view of the aggregate supply curve, the
simple “Keynesian” view, holds that at any given moment, the
economy has a clearly defined capacity, or maximum, output.
This maximum output, denoted by YF, is defined by the exist-
ing labor force, the current capital stock, and the existing state
of technology. If planned aggregate expenditure increases
when the economy is producing below this maximum capac-
ity, this view holds, inventories will be lower than planned,
and firms will increase output, but the price level will not
change. Firms are operating with underutilized plants (excess
capacity), and there is cyclical unemployment. Expansion
does not exert any upward pressure on prices. However, if
planned aggregate expenditure increases when the economy
is producing near or at its maximum (YF), inventories will be
lower than planned, but firms cannot increase their output.
The result will be an increase in the price level, or inflation.
This view is illustrated in the figure. In the top half of the
diagram, aggregate output (income) (Y) and planned aggre-
gate expenditure (C + I + G
AE) are initially in equilib-
rium at AE1, Y1, and price level P1. Now suppose a tax cut or
an increase in government spending increases planned
aggregate expenditure. If such an increase shifts the AE curve
from AE1 to AE2 and the corresponding aggregate demand
curve from AD1 to AD2, the equilibrium level of output will
rise from Y1 to YF. (Remember, an expansionary policy shifts
the AD curve to the right.) Because we were initially produc-
ing below capacity output (Y1 is lower than YF), the price
level will be unaffected, remaining at P1.
Now consider what would happen if AE increased even fur-
ther. Suppose planned aggregate expenditure shifted from AE2
to AE3, with a corresponding shift of AD2 to AD3. If the
economy were producing below capacity output, the equilib-
rium level of output would rise to Y3. However, the output of
the economy cannot exceed the maximum output of YF. As
inventories fall below what was planned, firms encounter a fully
employed labor market
and 
fully 
utilized
plants. Therefore, they
cannot increase their
output. The result is
that the aggregate sup-
ply curve becomes ver-
tical at YF, and the price
level is driven up to P3.
The 
difference
between planned aggre-
gate expenditure and
aggregate output at full
capacity is sometimes
referred 
to 
as 
an
inflationary gap. You
can see the inflationary
gap in the top half of
the figure.At YF (capac-
ity output), planned
aggregate expenditure
(shown by AE3) is
greater than YF. The
price level rises to P3
until 
the 
aggregate
quantity supplied and
the aggregate quantity
demanded are equal.
Despite the fact
that the kinked aggre-
gate supply curve pro-
vides some insights,
most economists find it unrealistic. It does not seem likely
that the whole economy suddenly runs into a capacity “wall”
at a specific level of output. As output expands, some firms
and industries will hit capacity before others.

By looking at Figure 28.4, you can begin to see why arguments about the shape of the
AS curve are so important in policy debates. If the long-run AS curve is vertical as we have drawn
it, factors that shift the AD curve to the right—including policy actions such as increasing govern-
ment spending—simply end up increasing the price level. If the short-run AS curve also is quite
steep, even in the short run, most of the effect of any shift in the AD curve will be felt in an
increase in the price level rather than an increase in aggregate output. If the AS curve, on the other
hand, is flat, AD shifts can have a large effect on aggregate output, at least in the short run. We dis-
cuss these effects of policy in more detail later in this chapter.
Potential GDP
Recall that even the short-run AS curve becomes vertical at some particular level of output.
The vertical portion of the short-run AS curve exists because there are physical limits to the
amount that an economy can produce in any given time period. At the physical limit, all
With planned aggregate expenditure of
AE1 and aggregate demand of AD1,
equilibrium output is Y1. A shift of
planned aggregate expenditure to AE2,
corresponding to a shift of the AD
curve to AD2, causes output to rise but
the price level to remain at P1. If
planned aggregate expenditure and
aggregate demand exceed YF, however,
there is an inflationary gap and the
price level rises to P3.

CHAPTER 28
Aggregate Supply and the Equilibrium Price Level 565
plants are operating around the clock, many workers are on overtime, and there is no cycli-
cal unemployment.
Note that the vertical portions of the short-run AS curves in Figure 28.4 on p. 563 are to the
right of Y0. If the vertical portions of the short-run AS curves represent “capacity,” what is the
nature of Y0, the level of output corresponding to the long-run AS curve? Y0 represents the level
of aggregate output that can be sustained in the long run without inflation. It is sometimes called
potential output or potential GDP. Output can be pushed above Y0 under a variety of circum-
stances, but when it is, there is upward pressure on wages. As the economy approaches short-run
capacity, wage rates tend to rise as firms try to attract more people into the labor force and to
induce more workers to work overtime. Rising wages shift the short-run AS curve to the left (in
Figure 28.4 from AS0 to AS1) and drive output back to Y0.
Short-Run Equilibrium Below Potential Output
Thus far we have argued that if
the short-run aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves intersect to the right of Y0 in
Figure 28.4, wages will rise, causing the short-run AS curve to shift to the left and pushing aggre-
gate output back down to Y0. Although different economists have different opinions on how to
determine whether an economy is operating at or above potential output, there is general agree-
ment that there is a maximum level of output (below the vertical portion of the short-run aggre-
gate supply curve) that can be sustained without inflation.
What about short-run equilibria that occur to the left of Y0? If the short-run aggregate sup-
ply and aggregate demand curves intersect at a level of output below potential output, what will
happen? Here again economists disagree. Those who believe the aggregate supply curve is vertical
in the long run believe that when short-run equilibria exist below Y0, output will tend to rise—
just as output tends to fall when short-run equilibria exist above Y0. The argument is that when
the economy is operating below full employment with excess capacity and high unemployment,
wages are likely to fall. A decline in wages shifts the aggregate supply curve to the right, causing
the price level to fall and the level of aggregate output to rise back to Y0. This automatic adjust-
ment works only if wages fall when excess capacity and unemployment exist. We will discuss
wage adjustment during periods of unemployment in detail in Chapter 29.
Monetary and Fiscal Policy Effects
We are now ready to use the AS/AD framework to consider the effects of monetary and fiscal pol-
icy. We will first consider the short-run effects.
Recall that the two fiscal policy variables are government purchases (G) and net taxes (T).
The monetary policy variable is the quantity of money supplied (Ms). An expansionary policy
aims at stimulating the economy through an increase in G or Ms or a decrease in T. A
contractionary policy aims at slowing down the economy through a decrease in G or Ms or an
increase in T. We saw earlier in this chapter that an expansionary policy shifts the AD curve to
the right and that a contractionary policy shifts the AD curve to the left. How do these policies
affect the equilibrium values of the price level (P) and the level of aggregate output (income)?
When considering the effects of a policy change, we must be careful to note where along the
(short-run) AS curve the economy is at the time of the change. If the economy is initially on the
flat portion of the AS curve, as shown by point A in Figure 28.5, an expansionary policy, which
shifts the AD curve to the right, will result in a small price increase relative to the output increase:
The increase in equilibrium Y (from Y0 to Y1) is much greater than the increase in equilibrium P
(from P0 to P1). This is the case in which an expansionary policy works well. There is an increase
in output with little increase in the price level.
If the economy is initially on the steep portion of the AS curve, as shown by point B in
Figure 28.6, an expansionary policy will result in a small increase in equilibrium output (from Y0
to Y1) and a large increase in the equilibrium price level (from P0 to P1). In this case, an expan-
sionary policy does not work well. It results in a much higher price level with little increase in
output. The multiplier is therefore close to zero: Output is initially close to capacity, and attempts
to increase it further lead mostly to a higher price level.
Figures 28.5 and 28.6 show that it is important to know where the economy is before a policy
change is put into effect. The economy is producing on the nearly flat part of the AS curve when

most firms are producing well below capacity. When this is the case, firms will respond to an
increase in demand by increasing output much more than they increase prices. When the econ-
omy is producing on the steep part of the AS curve, firms are close to capacity and will respond
to an increase in demand by increasing prices much more than they increase output.
To see what happens when the economy is on the steep part of the AS curve, consider the
effects of an increase in G with no change in the money supply. What will happen is that when G
is increased, there will be virtually no increase in Y. In other words, the expansionary fiscal policy
will fail to stimulate the economy. To consider this, we need to go back to Chapter 27 and review
what is behind the AD curve.
The first thing that happens when G increases is an unanticipated decline in firms’ invento-
ries. Because firms are very close to capacity output when the economy is on the steep part of
the AS curve, they cannot increase their output very much. The result, as Figure 28.6 shows, is a
substantial increase in the price level. The increase in the price level increases the demand for
money, which (with a fixed money supply) leads to an increase in the interest rate, decreasing
planned investment. There is nearly complete crowding out of investment. If firms are producing
at capacity, prices and interest rates will continue to rise until the increase in G is completely
matched by a decrease in planned investment and there is complete crowding out.

CHAPTER 28
Aggregate Supply and the Equilibrium Price Level 567
Long-Run Aggregate Supply and Policy Effects
We have so far been considering monetary and fiscal policy effects in the short run. It is impor-
tant to realize that if the AS curve is vertical in the long run, neither monetary policy nor fiscal
policy has any effect on aggregate output in the long run. Look back at Figure 28.4 on p. 563.
Monetary and fiscal policy shift the AD curve. If the long-run AS curve is vertical, output always
comes back to Y0. In this case, policy affects only the price level in the long run and the multiplier
effect of a change in government spending on aggregate output in the long run is zero. Under the
same circumstances, the tax multiplier is also zero.
The conclusion that policy has no effect on aggregate output in the long run is perhaps star-
tling. Do most economists agree that the aggregate supply curve is vertical in the long run? Most
economists agree that wages tend to lag behind output prices in the short run, giving the AS curve
some positive slope. Most also agree the AS curve is likely to be steeper in the long run, but how
long is the long run? The longer the lag time, the greater the potential impact of monetary and
fiscal policy on aggregate output. If wages follow output prices within, say, 3 to 6 months, policy
has little chance to affect output. If the long run is 3 or 4 years, policy can have significant effects.
A good deal of research in macroeconomics focuses on the length of time lags between wages and
output prices. In a sense, the length of the long run is one of the most important open questions
in macroeconomics.
Another source of disagreement centers on whether equilibria below potential output, Y0 in
Figure 28.4, are self-correcting (that is, without government intervention). Recall that those who
believe in a vertical long-run AS curve believe that slack in the economy will put downward pres-
sure on wages, causing the short-run AS curve to shift to the right and pushing aggregate ouput
back toward Y0. However, some argue that wages do not fall during slack periods and that the
economy can get “stuck” at an equilibrium below potential output. In this case, monetary and
fiscal policy would be necessary to restore full employment. We will return to this debate in
Chapter 29.
The “new classical” economics, which we will discuss in Chapter 33, assumes that prices
and wages are fully flexible and adjust very quickly to changing conditions. New classical
economists believe, for example, that wage rate changes do not lag behind price changes. The
new classical view is consistent with the existence of a vertical AS curve, even in the short
run. At the other end of the spectrum is what is sometimes called the simple “Keynesian”
view of aggregate supply. Those who hold this view believe there is a kink in the AS curve at
capacity output, as we discussed in Economics in Practice, “The Simple ‘Keynesian’ Aggregate
Supply Curve.”
Causes of Inflation
We now turn to inflation and use the AS/AD framework to consider the causes of inflation.
Demand-Pull Inflation
Inflation initiated by an increase in aggregate demand is called demand-pull inflation.You can see
how demand-pull inflation works by looking at Figures 28.5 and 28.6. In both, the inflation begins
with a shift of the aggregate demand schedule from AD0 to AD1, which causes the price level to
increase from P0 to P1. (Output also increases, from Y0 to Y1.) If the economy is operating on the
steep portion of the AS curve at the time of the increase in aggregate demand, as in Figure 28.6,
most of the effect will be an increase in the price level instead of an increase in output. If the econ-
omy is operating on the flat portion of the AS curve, as in Figure 28.5, most of the effect will be an
increase in output instead of an increase in the price level.
Remember, in the long run the initial increase in the price level will cause the AS curve to
shift to the left as wages respond to the increase in output prices. If the long-run AS curve is ver-
tical, as depicted in Figure 28.4, the increase in wages will shift the short-run AS curve (AS0) to
the left to AS1, pushing the price level even higher, to P2. If the long-run AS curve is vertical, a
shift in aggregate demand from AD0 to AD1 will result, in the long run, in no increase in output
and a price-level increase from P0 to P2.

The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
Cost-Push, or Supply-Side, Inflation
Inflation can also be caused by an increase in costs, referred to as cost-push, or supply-side,
inflation. Several times in the last three decades oil prices in world markets increased sharply.
Because oil is used in virtually every line of business, costs increased.
An increase in costs (a cost shock) shifts the AS curve to the left, as Figure 28.7 shows. If we
assume the government does not react to this shift in AS by changing fiscal or monetary policy,
the AD curve will not shift. The supply shift will cause the equilibrium price level to rise (from P0
to P1) and the level of aggregate output to decline (from Y0 to Y1). Recall from Chapter 20 that
stagflation occurs when output is falling at the same time prices are rising—in other words,
when the economy is experiencing both a contraction and inflation simultaneously. Figure 28.7
shows that one possible cause of stagflation is an increase in costs.
To return to monetary and fiscal policy for a moment, note from Figure 28.7 that the gov-
ernment could counteract the increase in costs (the cost shock) by engaging in an expansionary
policy (an increase in G or Ms or a decrease in T). This would shift the AD curve to the right, and
the new AD curve would intersect the new AS curve at a higher level of output. The problem
with this policy, however, is that the intersection of the new AS and AD curves would take place
at a price even higher than P1 in Figure 28.7. Cost shocks are thus bad news for policy makers.
The only way they can counter the output loss brought about by a cost shock is by having the
price level increase even more than it would without the policy action. This situation is illus-
trated in Figure 28.8.
Expectations and Inflation
When firms are making their price/output decisions, their expectations of future prices may affect
their current decisions. If a firm expects that its competitors will raise their prices, in anticipa-
tion, it may raise its own price.
Consider a firm that manufactures toasters in an imperfectly competitive market. The
toaster maker must decide what price to charge retail stores for its toaster. If it overestimates
price and charges much more than other toaster manufacturers are charging, it will lose many
customers. If it underestimates price and charges much less than other toaster makers are
charging, it will gain customers but at a considerable loss in revenue per sale. The firm’s
optimum price—the price that maximizes the firm’s profits—is presumably not too far from the
average of its competitors’ prices. If it does not know its competitors’ projected prices before it
sets its own price, as is often the case, it must base its price on what it expects its competitors’
prices to be.
Suppose inflation has been running at about 10 percent per year. Our firm probably expects
its competitors will raise their prices about 10 percent this year, so it is likely to raise the price of

its own toaster by about 10 percent. This response is how expectations can get “built into the sys-
tem.” If every firm expects every other firm to raise prices by 10 percent, every firm will raise
prices by about 10 percent. Every firm ends up with the price increase it expected.
The fact that expectations can affect the price level is vexing. Expectations can lead to an iner-
tia that makes it difficult to stop an inflationary spiral. If prices have been rising and if people’s
expectations are adaptive—that is, if they form their expectations on the basis of past pricing
behavior—firms may continue raising prices even if demand is slowing or contracting. In terms of
the AS/AD diagram, an increase in inflationary expectations that causes firms to increase their
prices shifts the AS curve to the left. Remember that the AS curve represents the price/output
responses of firms. If firms increase their prices because of a change in inflationary expectations,
the result is a leftward shift of the AS curve.
Given the importance of expectations in inflation, the central banks of many countries survey
consumers about their expectations. In Great Britain, for example, a survey of consumers by the
Bank of England found a rise in expectations of inflation from 3.9 percent in February 2008 to
4.9 percent in May 2008. One of the aims of central banks is to try to keep these expectations low.
Money and Inflation
It is easy to see that an increase in the money supply can lead to an increase in the aggregate price
level. As Figures 28.5 and 28.6 show, an increase in the money supply (Ms) shifts the AD curve to
the right and results in a higher price level. This is simply a demand-pull inflation.
However, the supply of money may also play a role in creating inflation that persists over a long
period of time, which we will call a “sustained”inflation. Consider an initial increase in government
spending (G) with the money supply (Ms) unchanged.Because the money supply is unchanged,this
is an increase in G that is not “accommodated” by the Fed. The increase in G shifts the AD curve to
the right and results in a higher price level. This is shown in Figure 28.9 as a shift from AD0 to AD1.
(In Figure 28.9, the economy is assumed to be operating on the vertical portion of the AS curve.)
Remember what happens when the price level increases. The higher price level causes the
demand for money to increase. With an unchanged money supply and an increase in the quantity
of money demanded, the interest rate will rise and the result will be a decrease in planned invest-
ment (I) spending. The new equilibrium corresponds to higher G, lower I, a higher interest rate,
and a higher price level.
Now let us take our example one step further. Suppose that the Fed is sympathetic to the
expansionary fiscal policy (the increase in G we just discussed) and decides to expand the supply
of money to keep the interest rate constant. As the higher price level pushes up the demand for
money, the Fed expands the supply of money with the goal of keeping the interest rate
unchanged, eliminating the crowding-out effect of a higher interest rate.

fiscal policy could be changed
enough to have the AD curve

icy would raise aggregate output
Y again, but it would raise the
price level further, to P2.

The text describes ways in which expectations that prices will rise
can be self-fulfilling as firms raise prices in expectation that all
other prices will rise. In the following article, this same phenome-
non is discussed in the context of China. It is also interesting to
note that many people believed the official statistics on inflation
understated their own experience. This is quite like the sentiment
of the pensioner in Maryland highlighted in the Economics in
Practice in Chapter 22 who thought that the BLS’s inflation index
underestimated her cost increases!
Inflation Perceptions Run High in China
The Wall Street Journal
A new poll by Horizon Research Consultancy Group, China's
largest polling firm, finds 60.8% of respondents believe
China is experiencing “serious” inflation, a disquieting finding
which suggests China's inflation problem may be more
severe than official statistics indicate.
Public perceptions of inflation are important, because
inflationary expectations can become self-fulfilling. If con-
sumers anticipate future price rises, they may accelerate
their planned purchases, and may take savings out of low-
yielding investments like bank deposits, thus adding to infla-
tionary pressures.
Over 77% of respondents to the Horizon poll said they
expect prices to rise further over the next year, with 57.7%

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
When the supply of money is expanded, the AD curve shifts to the right again, from AD1 to
AD2. This shift of the AD curve, brought about by the increased money supply, pushes prices up
even further. Higher prices, in turn, increase the demand for money further, which requires a fur-
ther increase in the money supply and so on.
What would happen if the Fed tried to keep the interest rate constant when the economy was
operating on the steep part of the AS curve? The situation could lead to a hyperinflation, a period
of very rapid increases in the price level. If no more output can be coaxed out of the economy and
if planned investment is not allowed to fall (because the interest rate is kept unchanged), it is not

those polled felt China's official inflation expectations reflect
their personal experience, while 44.7% felt they did not, sug-

tics understate the extent of price rises.

2 This means that the public’s demand for money no longer depends on the interest rate. Even though the interest rate is very
high, the public cannot be induced to have its real money balances fall any farther. There is a limit concerning how much the
public can be induced to have its real money balances fall.
possible to increase G. As the Fed keeps pumping more and more money into the economy to
keep the interest rate unchanged, the price level will keep rising.
Sustained Inflation as a Purely Monetary Phenomenon
Virtually all economists agree that an increase in the price level can be caused by anything that
causes the AD curve to shift to the right or the AS curve to shift to the left. These include expan-
sionary fiscal policy actions, monetary expansion, cost shocks, changes in expectations, and so
on. It is also generally agreed that for a sustained inflation to occur, the Fed must accommodate
it. In this sense, a sustained inflation can be thought of as a purely monetary phenomenon.
This argument, first put forth by monetarists (coming in Chapter 33), has gained wide accep-
tance. It is easy to show, as we just did, how expanding the money supply can continuously shift the
AD curve. It is not as easy to come up with other reasons for continued shifts of the AD curve if the
money supply is constant. One possibility is for the government to increase spending continuously
without increasing taxes, but this process cannot continue forever. To finance spending without
taxes, the government must borrow. Without any expansion of the money supply, the interest rate
will rise dramatically because of the increase in the supply of government bonds. The public must be
willing to buy the government bonds that are being issued to finance the spending increases.At some
point, the public may be unwilling to buy any more bonds even though the interest rate is very high.2
At this point, the government is no longer able to increase non-tax-financed spending without the
Fed’s cooperation. If this is true, a sustained inflation cannot exist without the Fed’s cooperation.
The Behavior of the Fed
We have so far in this book talked about monetary policy as consisting of changes in the money sup-
ply (MS), which affects the interest rate (r).We saw in Chapter 25 that the Fed can change the money
supply by (1) changing the required reserve ratio, (2) changing the discount rate, and (3) engaging in
open market operations (buying and selling government securities). We also pointed out that the
main way in which the Fed changes the money supply is by engaging in open market operations.
Through these operations the Fed can achieve whatever value of the money supply it wants.
We must add two key points to the monetary policy story to make the story realistic, as we do
in this section. The first point is that in practice, the Fed targets the interest rate rather than the
money supply. The second point is that the interest rate value that the Fed chooses depends on the
state of the economy. We will first explain these two points and then turn to a discussion of actual
Fed policy from 1970 on. Figure 28.10 outlines how the Fed behaves in practice. It will be useful
to keep this figure in mind in the following discussion.
Targeting the Interest Rate
In Chapter 26 we described the way in which the Fed changes the money supply by buying and sell-
ing government securities.We noted that a change in the money supply led to a change in the inter-
est rate as the new money supply curve intersected with the existing money demand curve.
Increases in the money supply reduced interest rates, while decreases in the money supply raised
rates. The steeper the money demand curve, the larger the effect of a money supply change on rates.
In the earlier chapters we worked through these changes by focusing on the money supply as
the Fed instrument. In practice, however, the actual variable of interest to the Fed is not the
money supply, but the interest rate. In practice, it is the interest rate that directly affects economic
activity, for example, by affecting firms’ decisions about investing. Targeting the interest rate thus
gives the Fed more control over the key variable that matters to the economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets every 6 weeks and sets the value of the
interest rate. It then instructs the Open Market Desk at the New York Federal Reserve Bank to
keep buying or selling government securities until the desired interest rate value is achieved.

Fed Behavior
The FOMC announces the interest rate value at 2:15 P.M. eastern time on the day it meets.
This is a key time for financial markets around the world. At 2:14 P.M., thousands of people are
staring at their computer screens waiting for the word from on high. If the announcement is a
surprise, it can have very large and immediate effects on bond and stock markets.
For most of the rest of this text, we will talk about monetary policy as being a change in the
interest rate. Keep in mind, of course, that monetary policy also changes the money supply. We
can talk about an expansionary monetary policy as one in which the money supply is increased or
one in which the interest rate is lowered. We will talk about the interest rate being lowered
because the interest rate is what the Fed targets in practice. However we talk about it, an expan-
sionary monetary policy is achieved by the Fed’s buying government securities.
The Fed’s Response to the State of the Economy
When the FOMC meets every 6 weeks to set the value of the interest rate, it does not set the value in a
vacuum. An important question in macroeconomics is what influences the interest rate decision. To
answer this,we must consider the main goals of the Fed.What ultimately is the Fed trying to achieve?
The Fed’s main goals are high levels of output and employment and a low rate of inflation.
From the Fed’s point of view, the best situation is a fully employed economy with an inflation
rate near zero. The worst situation is stagflation—high unemployment and high inflation.
If the economy is in a low output/low inflation situation, it will be producing on the relatively
flat portion of the aggregate supply (AS) curve (Figure 28.11). In this case, the Fed can increase out-
put by lowering the interest rate (and thus increasing the money supply) with little effect on the
price level. The expansionary monetary policy will shift the aggregate demand (AD) curve to the
right, leading to an increase in output with little change in the price level. The Fed is likely to lower
the interest rate (and thus increase the money supply) during times of low output and low inflation.
The opposite is true in times of high output and high inflation. In this situation, the econ-
omy is producing on the relatively steep portion of the AS curve (Figure 28.12), and the Fed can
increase the interest rate (and thus decrease the money supply) with little effect on output. The
contractionary monetary policy will shift the AD curve to the left, which will lead to a fall in the
price level and little effect on output.3 The Fed is likely to increase the interest rate (and thus
3 In practice, the price level rarely falls. What the Fed actually achieves in this case is a decrease in the rate of inflation—that is, in
the percentage change in the price level—not a decrease in the price level itself. The discussion here is sliding over the distinc-
tion between the price level and the rate of inflation. This distinction is discussed further in the next chapter.

In the text we have described the impact that decisions by the
Federal Reserve to increase or decrease interest rates have on
the economy as a whole. One measure of how important inter-
est rates are to the health of the economy is the attention paid
to Fed actions by the private sector, including prominently the
major investment banks. All of the major investment banks
employ economists to help them forecast what the Fed will do.
As the following article indicates, these economists have been
especially active in the recent period as there has been more
uncertainty about whether the Fed might begin to tighten
(raise interest rates) as the U.S. economy recovers.
J.P. Morgan Pushes Back Rate Hike
Forecast to Late 2011
The Wall Street Journal
J.P. Morgan’s economists are pushing back their expecta-
tions of when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as
next week’s central bank meeting quickly approaches.
Bank economist Michael Feroli told clients Thursday his
bank now expects the Fed to first raise rates in the fourth
quarter of 2011, rather than the second quarter. “The prime
motivation for the change is the behavior of inflation,” the
economist wrote.
“While we have been expecting core inflation to fall below
1%, the degree to which this has been located in the more per-
sistent service price component, as well as the extent to which
wage inflation has slowed, both suggest the disinflation we
have witnessed could be with us for some time,” Feroli said.
Pushing back estimates of rate hikes has been in fash-
ion on Wall Street over recent weeks. Central bankers meet

next week in a gathering that’s almost certain to result in
the overnight target rate left at its effectively 0% stance.
Economists have looked at the economy's moderate and
uneven growth rates, joined with anemic job gains, and con-
cluded the central bank faces no urgency in raising rates.
Meanwhile, central bankers have done little to disabuse mar-
kets of the expectation that any rate hikes lie well off in the
distance: Feroli noted his forecast shift is “supported by,
though not motivated by, the rhetoric of Fed leadership.”
Economists at UBS also recently changed their estimate
of Fed action, delaying the expectation of a tightening in
rates until the late January 2011 Federal Open Market
Committee meeting. They had thought the move would
come in September. UBS took action largely out of concern
that the financial distress in Europe would create trouble and
uncertainty for the U.S. economy, which in turn argues for
continued central bank support for growth.

decrease the money supply) during times of high output and high inflation. In this discussion, we
see again the role of the shape of AS curve in determining the likely effect of government policy.
Stagflation is a more difficult problem to solve. If the Fed lowers the interest rate, output will
rise, but so will the inflation rate (which is already too high). If the Fed increases the interest rate,
the inflation rate will fall, but so will output (which is already too low). (You should be able to
draw AS/AD diagrams to see why this is true.) The Fed is faced with a trade-off. In this case, the

The Fed’s Response to
High Output/High
Inflation
During periods of high output/
high inflation, the economy is on
the relatively steep portion of the
AS curve. In this case, the Fed is
likely to increase the interest rate
(and thus contract the money
supply). This will shift the AD
curve to the left, from AD0 to
AD1, and lead to a decrease in
the price level with very little
decrease in output.
Fed’s decisions depend on how it weights output relative to inflation. If it dislikes high inflation
more than low output, it will increase the interest rate; if it dislikes low output more than high
inflation, it will lower the interest rate. In practice, the Fed probably dislikes high inflation more
than low output, but how the Fed behaves depends in part on the beliefs of the chair of the Fed.
The Fed is sometimes said to “lean against the wind,” meaning that as the economy expands,
the Fed uses open market operations to raise the interest rate gradually to try to prevent the econ-
omy from expanding too quickly. Conversely, as the economy contracts, the Fed lowers the inter-
est rate gradually to lessen (and eventually stop) the contraction.
Fed Behavior Since 1970 
Figure 28.13 plots three variables that can be used to describe Fed behavior since 1970. The inter-
est rate is the 3-month Treasury bill rate, which moves closely with the interest rate that the Fed
actually targets, which is the federal funds rate. For simplicity, we will take the 3-month Treasury
bill rate to be the rate that the Fed targets and we will just call it “the interest rate.” Inflation is the
percentage change in the GDP deflator over the previous 4 quarters. This variable is also plotted
in Figure 20.6 on p. 420. Output is the percentage deviation of real GDP from its trend. (Real
GDP itself is plotted in Figure 20.4 on p. 418.) It is easier to see fluctuations in real GDP by look-
ing at percentage deviations from its trend.
Recall from Chapter 20 that we have called five periods since 1970 “recessionary periods”and
two periods “high inflation periods.” These periods are highlighted in Figure 28.13. The reces-
sionary and high inflation periods have considerable overlap in the last half of the 1970s and early
1980s. After 1981, there are no more high inflation periods and three more recessionary periods.
There is thus some stagflation in the early part of the period since 1970 but not in the later part.
We know from earlier in this chapter that stagflation is bad news for policy makers. Should the
Fed raise the interest rate to lessen inflation at a cost of making the output situation worse, or should
it lower the interest rate to help output growth at a cost of making inflation worse? What did the Fed
actually do? You can see from Figure 28.13 that the Fed generally raised the interest rate when infla-
tion was high—even when output was low. In particular, the interest rate was very high in the
1979–1983 period even though output was low. Had the Fed not had such high interest rates in this
period, the recession would likely have been less severe, but inflation would have been even worse.
After inflation got back down to about 4 percent in 1983, the Fed began lowering the interest
rate, which helped output. The Fed increased the interest rate in 1988 as inflation began to pick
up a little and output was strong. The Fed acted aggressively in lowering the interest rate during
the 1990–1991 recession and again in the 2001 recession. The Treasury bill rate got below 1 per-
cent in 2003. The Fed then reversed course, and the interest rate rose to nearly 5 percent in 2006.
The Fed then reversed course again near the end of 2007 and began lowering the interest rate in
an effort to fight a recession that it expected was coming. The recession did come, and the Fed
lowered the interest rate to near zero beginning in 2008 IV.

CHAPTER 28
Aggregate Supply and the Equilibrium Price Level 575
Fed behavior in the period since 1970 is thus fairly easy to summarize. The Fed generally had
high interest rates in the 1970s and early 1980s as it fought inflation. Since 1983, inflation has
been low by historical standards, and the Fed focused in this period on trying to smooth fluctua-
tions in output.
Interest Rates Near Zero 
As just noted, the Fed lowered the short-term interest rate to near zero beginning in 2008 IV.
Since interest rates cannot go below zero, the ability of the Fed to stimulate the economy when
interest rates are zero is severely limited. Its main way of stimulating the economy is to lower
interest rates, which stimulates plant and equipment investment as well as consumption of
durable goods and housing investment. This option is not available when interest rates are near
zero. In this case stimulus must come primarily from fiscal policy.
In 2010 the Fed was in an even worse position than the existence of a near zero interest
rate might suggest. We saw in Chapter 26 that commercial banks held an enormous quantity
of excess reserves—over $900 billion—in the middle of 2010. The Fed had tried to stimulate
bank lending by buying mortgage-backed securities—replacing mortgage-backed securities
held by the private sector with reserves that could be loaned out. In practice, the 
banks just held the reserves as excess reserves. Therefore, in 2010 the Fed could neither stim-
ulate by lowering interest rates because they were near zero nor stimulate bank lending by
buying mortgage-backed securities because the banks just held the reserves this created as
excess reserves.

Inflation Targeting
Some monetary authorities in the world engage in what is called inflation targeting. If a mon-
etary authority behaves this way, it announces a target value of the inflation rate, usually for a
horizon of a year or more, and then it chooses its interest rate values with the aim of keeping
the actual inflation rate within some specified band around the target value. For example, the
target value might be 2 percent with a band of 1 to 3 percent. Then the monetary authority
would try to keep the actual inflation rate between 1 and 3 percent. With a horizon of a year or
more, the monetary authority would not expect to keep the inflation rate between 1 and 3 per-
cent each month because there are a number of temporary factors that move the inflation rate
around each month (such as weather) over which the monetary authority has no control. But
over a year or more, the expectation would be that the inflation rate would be between 1 and
3 percent. For example, in Hungary in 2008 the central bank set a medium-term inflation tar-
get of 3 percent.
In the discussion at the beginning of this section about the Fed’s response to the state of the
economy, we assumed that the Fed was concerned about both inflation and output. When output
is low, other things being equal, it was argued that the Fed is likely to lower the interest rate to stim-
ulate the economy. If at the same time inflation is high (stagflation), the Fed is faced with a trade-
off, and whether it raises or lowers the interest rate depends on how it weights output relative 
to inflation. In the case of inflation targeting, all the weight is on inflation. So inflation 
targeting is a special case of Fed behavior just discussed—namely, the case in which all of the Fed’s
focus is on setting the interest rate to keep the inflation rate within some band over some horizon.
There has been much debate about whether inflation targeting is a good idea. The Fed
under Alan Greenspan and previous chairs never engaged in inflation targeting, but the issue
arose in the United States with the appointment of Ben Bernanke in 2006 as the new Fed chair.
Bernanke had argued in the past in favor of inflation targeting, and people wondered whether
the Fed would move in this direction under Bernanke. You can see in Figure 28.13 that the Fed
began lowering the interest rate in 2007 in anticipation of a recession, which doesn’t look like
inflation targeting. As we indicated in the opening to this chapter, however, inflation has not yet
been a problem as the economy recovers from the 2008–2009 recession, and Bernanke has not
yet been tested.
Looking Ahead
In Chapters 23 and 24, we discussed the concept of an equilibrium level of aggregate output and
income, the idea of the multiplier, and the basics of fiscal policy. Those two chapters centered on
the workings of the goods market alone.
In Chapters 25 and 26, we analyzed the money market by discussing the supply of money, the
demand for money, the equilibrium interest rate, and the basics of monetary p olicy. In
Chapter 27, we brought our analysis of the goods market together with our analysis of the money
market and we derived the aggregate demand curve.
In this chapter, we introduced the aggregate supply curve. By using the aggregate supply and
aggregate demand curves, we can determine the equilibrium price level in the economy and
understand some causes of inflation.
We have still said little about employment, unemployment, and the functioning of the labor
market in the macroeconomy. The next chapter will link everything we have done so far to this
third major market arena—the labor market—and to the problem of unemployment.

THE AGGREGATE SUPPLY CURVE p. 559
1. Aggregate supply is the total supply of goods and services in an
economy. The aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the relation-
ship between the aggregate quantity of output supplied by all
the firms in an economy and the overall price level. The
AS curve is not a market supply curve, and it is not the sim-
ple sum of all the individual supply curves in the economy.
For this reason, it is helpful to think of the AS curve as a
“price/output response” curve—that is, a curve that traces out
the price decisions and output decisions of all the markets and
firms in the economy under a given set of circumstances.
2. The shape of the short-run AS curve is a source of much
controversy in macroeconomics. Many economists believe
that at very low levels of aggregate output, the AS curve is
S U M M A R Y

CHAPTER 28
Aggregate Supply and the Equilibrium Price Level 577
fairly flat and that at high levels of aggregate output, the
AS curve is vertical or nearly vertical. Thus, the AS curve
slopes upward and becomes vertical when the economy
reaches its capacity, or maximum, output.
3. Anything that affects an individual firm’s marginal cost
curve can shift the AS curve. The two main factors are wage
rates and energy prices.
THE EQUILIBRIUM PRICE LEVEL p. 562 
4. The equilibrium price level in the economy occurs at the
point at which the AS and AD curves intersect. The intersec-
tion of the AS and AD curves corresponds to equilibrium in
the goods and money markets and to a set of price/output
decisions on the part of all the firms in the economy.
THE LONG-RUN AGGREGATE SUPPLY CURVE p. 563 
5. If wages fully adjust to prices in the long run, then the long-
run AS curve will be vertical.
6. The level of aggregate output that can be sustained in the
long run without inflation is called potential output or
potential GDP.
MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY EFFECTS p. 565 
7. If the economy is initially producing on the flat portion of
the AS curve, an expansionary policy—which shifts the
AD curve to the right—will result in a small increase in the
equilibrium price level relative to the increase in equilibrium
output. If the economy is initially producing on the steep
portion of the AS curve, an expansionary policy results in a
small increase in equilibrium output and a large increase in
the equilibrium price level.
8. If the AS curve is vertical in the long run, neither monetary
nor fiscal policy has any effect on aggregate output in the
long run. For this reason, the exact length of the long run is
one of the most pressing questions in macroeconomics.
CAUSES OF INFLATION p. 567 
9. Demand-pull inflation is inflation initiated by an increase in
aggregate demand. Cost-push, or supply-side, inflation is
inflation initiated by an increase in costs like energy prices.
An increase in costs may also lead to stagflation—the situa-
tion in which the economy is experiencing a contraction and
inflation simultaneously.
10. Inflation can become “built into the system” as a result of
expectations. If prices have been rising and people form
their expectations on the basis of past pricing behavior,
firms may continue raising prices even if demand is slowing
or contracting.
11. When the price level increases, so too does the demand for
money. If the economy is operating on the steep part of the
AS curve and the Fed tries to keep the interest rate constant
by increasing the supply of money, the result could be a
hyperinflation—a period of very rapid increases in the
price level.
THE BEHAVIOR OF THE FED p. 571 
12. In practice, the Fed controls the interest rate rather than the
money supply. The interest rate value that the Fed chooses
depends on the state of the economy. The Fed wants high
output and low inflation. The Fed is likely to decrease the
interest rate during times of low output and low inflation,
and it is likely to increase the interest rate during times of
high output and high inflation.
13. The Fed generally had high interest rates in the 1970s and
early 1980s as it fought inflation. Since 1983, inflation has
been low by historical standards and the Fed focused in this
period on trying to smooth fluctuations in output.
14. Inflation targeting is the case where the monetary authority
weights only inflation. It chooses its interest rate values with
the aim of keeping the inflation rate within some specified
band over some specified horizon.

interest rates if the Fed held the money supply constant? Tell a
complete story.
3. By using aggregate supply and demand curves to illustrate your
points, discuss the impacts of the following events on the price
level and on equilibrium GDP (Y) in the short run:
a. A tax cut holding government purchases constant with the
economy operating at near full capacity
b. An increase in the money supply during a period of high
unemployment and excess industrial capacity
1. In Japan during the first half of 2000, the Bank of Japan kept
interest rates at a near zero level in an attempt to stimulate
demand. In addition, the government passed a substantial
increase in government expenditure and cut taxes. Slowly,
Japanese GDP began to grow with absolutely no sign of an
increase in the price level. Illustrate the position of the Japanese
economy with aggregate supply and demand curves. Where on
the short-run AS curve was Japan in 2000?
2. In 2008, the price of oil rose sharply on world markets. What
impact would you expect there to be on the aggregate price level
and on real GDP? Illustrate your answer with aggregate demand

c. An increase in the price of oil caused by a war in the Middle
East, assuming that the Fed attempts to keep interest rates
constant by accommodating inflation
d. An increase in taxes and a cut in government spending sup-
ported by a cooperative Fed acting to keep output from falling
4. During 1999 and 2000, a debate raged over whether the United
States was at or above potential GDP. Some economists feared the
economy was operating at a level of output above potential GDP
and inflationary pressures were building. They urged the Fed to
tighten monetary policy and increase interest rates to slow the
economy. Others argued that a worldwide glut of cheap products
was causing input prices to be lower, keeping prices from rising.
By using aggregate supply and demand curves and other use-
ful graphs, illustrate the following:
a. Those pushing the Fed to act were right, and prices start to
rise more rapidly in 2000. The Fed acts belatedly to slow
money growth (contract the money supply), driving up inter-
est rates and pushing the economy back to potential GDP.
b. The worldwide glut gets worse, and the result is a falling
price level (deflation) in the United States despite expanding
aggregate demand.
5. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 564] The Economics
in Practice describes the simple Keynesian aggregate supply curve
as one in which there is a maximum level of output given the
constraints of a fixed capital stock and a fixed supply of labor.
The presumption is that increases in demand when firms are
operating below capacity will result in output increases and no
input price or output price changes but that at levels of output
above full capacity, firms have no choice but to raise prices of
demand increases. In reality, however, the short-run aggregate
supply curve isn’t flat and then vertical. Rather, it becomes
steeper as we move from left to right on the diagram. Explain
why. What circumstances might lead to an equilibrium at a very
flat portion of the AS curve? at a very steep portion? 
6. Using aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves to illus-
trate, describe the effects of the following events on the price
level and on equilibrium GDP in the long run assuming that
input prices fully adjust to output prices after some lag:
a. An increase occurs in the money supply above potential GDP
b. A decrease in government spending and in the money sup-
ply with GDP above potential GDP occurs
c. Starting with the economy at potential GDP, a war in the
Middle East pushes up energy prices temporarily. The Fed
expands the money supply to accommodate the inflation.
7. Two separate capacity constraints are discussed in this chapter:
(1) the actual physical capacity of existing plants and equip-
ment, shown as the vertical portion of the short-run AS curve,
and (2) potential GDP, leading to a vertical long-run AS curve.
Explain the difference between the two. Which is greater, full-
capacity GDP or potential GDP? Why?
8. In country A, all wage contracts are indexed to inflation. That is,
each month wages are adjusted to reflect increases in the cost of
living as reflected in changes in the price level. In country B,
there are no cost-of-living adjustments to wages, but the work-
force is completely unionized. Unions negotiate 3-year contracts.
In which country is an expansionary monetary policy likely to
have a larger effect on aggregate output? Explain your answer
using aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves.
9. During 2001, the U.S. economy slipped into a recession. For the
next several years, the Fed and Congress used monetary and fiscal
policies in an attempt to stimulate the economy. Obtain data on
interest rates (such as the prime rate or the federal funds rate). Do
you see evidence of the Fed’s action? When did the Fed begin its
expansionary policy? Obtain data on total federal expenditures,
tax receipts, and the deficit. (Try www.commerce.gov). When did
fiscal policy become “expansionary”? Which policy seems to have
suffered more from policy lags?
10. Describe the Fed’s tendency to “lean against the wind.” Do the
Fed’s policies tend to stabilize or destabilize the economy?
11. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 573] In August
2010, the Fed’s discount rate was 0.75 percent and the federal
funds rate was 0.25 percent, with a Fed target of 0–0.25 percent.
The Economics in Practice states that all of the major investment
banks employ economists to help them forecast what the Fed will
do, and in mid-2010, many of these economists pushed back their
expectations of when the Fed would raise interest rates, citing
lower-than-anticipated inflation expectations, slow job growth,
and an overall weak economy as reasons for the delay in rate
increases. Go to www.frb.gov, www.bea.gov, and www.bls.gov  to
see what has happened to interest rates, the inflation rate, the
unemployment rate, and GDP since August 2010. Were the econ-
omists’ forecasts of the Fed delaying interest rate increases until
2011 correct? Describe any apparent correlation between the
changes in interest rates and changes in the inflation rate, the
unemployment rate, and GDP since August 2010.
12. From the following graph, identify the initial equilibrium, the
short-run equilibrium, and the long-run equilibrium based on
the scenarios below. Explain your answers and identify what
happens to the price level and aggregate output.
Scenario 1. The economy is initially in long-run equilibrium at
point A, and a cost shock causes cost-push inflation. The govern-
ment reacts by implementing an expansionary fiscal policy.
Scenario 2. The economy is initially in long-run equilibrium at
point A, and an increase in government purchases causes demand-
pull inflation. In the long run, wages respond to the inflation.
Scenario 3. The economy is initially in long-run equilibrium at
pointC, and the federal government implements an increase in cor-
porate taxes and personal income taxes. In the long run, firms and
workers adjust to the new price level and costs adjust accordingly.

13. The economy of Mayberry is currently in equilibrium at point A
on the graph below. Prince Barney of Mayberry has decided that
he wants the economy to grow and has ordered the Royal
Central Bank of Mayberry to print more currency so banks can
expand their loans to stimulate growth. Explain what will most
likely happen to the economy of Mayberry as a result of Prince
Barney’s actions and show the result on the graph.
14. Evaluate the following statement: In the short run, if an econ-
omy experiences inflation of 10 percent, the cause of the infla-
tion is unimportant. Whatever the cause, the only important
issue the government needs to be concerned with is the 10 per-
cent increase in the price level.
15. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 570] A monthly
survey conducted by Torcuato Di Tella University in Buenos
Aires showed that in August 2010, people in Argentina expected
inflation to increase 25 percent over the next 12 months, a simi-
lar response to the previous month’s survey. This shows a large
discrepancy between inflation expectations and the Argentine
Central Bank’s monthly index of consumer prices which showed
prices rising at an annual rate of 11.2 percent, the highest level
in 4 years. Use aggregate supply and demand curves to show the
effect of these expectations of inflation on the Argentine econ-
omy, assuming firms increase prices in response to the expecta-
tions. What can the Argentine Central Bank do to try to lower
the expectations to their projected inflation level of 11.2 per-
cent? What impact would this have on the aggregate supply and
demand curves?

CHAPTER OUTLINE
581
The Labor Market In
the Macroeconomy
In previous chapters, we empha-
sized the three broadly defined
markets in which households,
firms, the government, and the rest
of the world interact: (1) the goods
market, discussed in Chapters 23
and 24; (2) the money market, dis-
cussed in Chapters 25 and 26; and
(3) the labor market. In Chapter 22,
we described some features of the
U.S. labor market and explained
how the unemployment rate is
measured. Then in Chapter 28, we
considered the labor market briefly
in our discussion of the aggregate supply curve. Because labor is an input, what goes on in the
labor market affects the shape of the aggregate supply (AS) curve. Sticky wages cause the AS curve
to be upward sloping; if wages are completely flexible and rise every time prices rise by the same
percentage, the AS curve will be vertical.
In this chapter, we look further at the labor market’s role in the macroeconomy. First, we
consider the classical view, which holds that wages always adjust to clear the labor market, that is,
to equate the supply of and demand for labor. We then consider why the labor market may not
always clear and why unemployment may exist. Finally, we discuss the relationship between infla-
tion and unemployment. As we go through the analysis, it is important to recall why unemploy-
ment is one of the three primary concerns of macroeconomics. Go back and reread “The Costs of
Unemployment” in Chapter 22 (pp. 446–447). It is clear that unemployment imposes heavy costs
on the unemployed and on society. In June 2010 there were 14.6 million people unemployed.
The Labor Market: Basic Concepts
On the first Friday of every month, the Labor Department releases the results of a household sur-
vey that provides an estimate of the number of people with a job, the employed (E), as well as the
number of people who are looking for work but cannot find a job, the unemployed (U). The
labor force (LF) is the number of employed plus unemployed:
LF = E + U
The unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labor force:
To repeat, to be unemployed, a person must be out of a job and actively looking for work. When
a person stops looking for work, he or she is considered out of the labor force and is no longer
counted as unemployed.
It is important to realize that even if the economy is running at or near full capacity, the
unemployment rate will never be zero. The economy is dynamic. Students graduate from schools

and training programs; some businesses make profits and grow, while others suffer losses and go
out of business; people move in and out of the labor force and change careers. It takes time for
people to find the right job and for employers to match the right worker with the jobs they have.
This frictional and structural unemployment is inevitable and in many ways desirable. (Review
Chapter 22 if these terms are hazy to you.)
In this chapter, we are concerned with cyclical unemployment, the increase in unemploy-
ment that occurs during recessions and depressions.When the economy contracts, the number of
people unemployed and the unemployment rate rise. The United States has experienced several
periods of high unemployment. During the Great Depression, the unemployment rate remained
high for nearly a decade. In December 1982, more than 12 million people were unemployed,
putting the unemployment rate at 10.8 percent. In the recession of 2008–2009, the unemploy-
ment rate rose to over 10 percent.
In one sense, the reason employment falls when the economy experiences a downturn is
obvious. When firms cut back on production, they need fewer workers, so people get laid off.
Employment tends to fall when aggregate output falls and to rise when aggregate output rises.
Nevertheless, a decline in the demand for labor does not necessarily mean that unemployment will
rise. If markets work as we described in Chapters 3 and 4, a decline in the demand for labor will
initially create an excess supply of labor. As a result, the wage rate will fall until the quantity of
labor supplied again equals the quantity of labor demanded, restoring equilibrium in the labor
market. At the new lower wage rate, everyone who wants a job will have one.
If the quantity of labor demanded and the quantity of labor supplied are brought into equilib-
rium by rising and falling wage rates, there should be no persistent unemployment above the fric-
tional and structural amount. Labor markets should behave just like simple output markets
described in simple supply and demand curves. This was the view held by the classical economists
who preceded Keynes, and it is still the view of a number of economists. Other economists believe
that the labor market is different from other markets and that wage rates adjust only slowly to
decreases in the demand for labor.If true,economies can suffer bouts of involuntary unemployment.
The Classical View of the Labor Market
The classical view of the labor market is illustrated in Figure 29.1. Classical economists assumed
that the wage rate adjusts to equate the quantity demanded with the quantity supplied, thereby
implying that unemployment does not exist. To see how this adjustment might take place, we can
use the supply and demand curves in Figure 29.1. Curve D0 is the labor demand curve. Each
point on D0 represents the amount of labor firms want to employ at each given wage rate. Each
firm’s decision about how much labor to demand is part of its overall profit-maximizing deci-
sion. A firm makes a profit by selling output to households. It will hire workers if the value of its
output is sufficient to justify the wage that is being paid. Thus, the amount of labor that a firm
hires depends on the value of output that workers produce.
Figure 29.1 also shows a labor supply curve, labeled S. Each point on the labor supply
curve represents the amount of labor households want to supply at each given wage rate. Each
household’s decision concerning how much labor to supply is part of the overall consumer
choice problem of a household. Each household member looks at the market wage rate, the
prices of outputs, and the value of leisure time (including the value of staying at home and
working in the yard or raising children) and chooses the amount of labor to supply (if any). A
household member not in the labor force has decided that his or her time is more valuable in
nonmarket activities.
In Figure 29.1 the labor market is initially in equilibrium at W0 and L0. Now consider what
classical economists think would happen if there is a decrease in the demand for labor. The demand
for labor curve shifts in from D0 to D1. The new demand curve intersects the labor supply curve at
L1 and W1. There is a new equilibrium at a lower wage rate, in which fewer people are employed.
Note that the fall in the demand for labor has not caused any unemployment. There are fewer peo-
ple working, but all people interested in working at the wage W1 are in fact employed.
The classical economists saw the workings of the labor market—the behavior of labor supply
and labor demand—as optimal from the standpoint of both individual households and firms and
from the standpoint of society. If households want more output than is currently being produced,
output demand will increase, output prices will rise, the demand for labor will increase, the wage rate

will rise, and more workers will be drawn into the labor force. (Some of those who preferred not to
be a part of the labor force at the lower wage rate will be lured into the labor force at the higher wage
rate.) At equilibrium, prices and wages reflect a trade-off between the value households place on out-
puts and the value of time spent in leisure and nonmarket work. At equilibrium, the people who are
not working have chosen not to work at that market wage. There is always full employment in this
sense. The classical economists believed that the market would achieve the optimal result if left to its
own devices, and there is nothing the government can do to make things better.
The Classical Labor Market and the Aggregate Supply Curve
How does the classical view of the labor market relate to the theory of the vertical AS curve we
covered in Chapter 28? The classical idea that wages adjust to clear the labor market is consistent
with the view that wages respond quickly to price changes. In the absence of sticky wages, the
AS curve will be vertical. In this case, monetary and fiscal policy will have no effect on real out-
put. Indeed, in this view, there is no unemployment problem to be solved!
The Unemployment Rate and the Classical View
If, as the classical economists assumed, the labor market works well, how can we account for the
fact that the unemployment rate at times seems high? There seem to be times when millions of
people who want jobs at prevailing wage rates cannot find them. How can we reconcile this situ-
ation with the classical assumption about the labor market?
Some economists answer by arguing that the unemployment rate is not a good measure of
whether the labor market is working well. We know the economy is dynamic and at any given time
some industries are expanding and some are contracting. Consider, for example, a carpenter who is
laid off because of a contraction in the construction industry. He had probably developed specific
skills related to the construction industry—skills not necessarily useful for jobs in other industries.
If he were earning $40,000 per year as a carpenter, he may be able to earn only $30,000 per year in
another industry. He may eventually work his way back up to a salary of $40,000 in the new indus-
try as he develops new skills, but this process will take time.Will this carpenter take a job at $30,000?
There are at least two reasons he may not. First, he may believe that the slump in the construction
industry is temporary and that he will soon get his job back. Second, he may mistakenly believe that
he can earn more than $30,000 in another industry and will continue to look for a better job.
If our carpenter decides to continue looking for a job paying more than $30,000 per year, he
will be considered unemployed because he is actively looking for work. This does not necessarily

584
PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
mean that the labor market is not working properly. The carpenter has chosen not to work for a
wage of $30,000 per year, but if his value to any firm outside the construction industry is no more
than $30,000 per year, we would not expect him to find a job paying more than $30,000. In this
case, a positive unemployment rate as measured by the government does not necessarily indicate
that the labor market is working poorly.
If the degree to which industries are changing in the economy fluctuates over time, there will
be more people like our carpenter at some times than at others. This variation will cause the mea-
sured unemployment rate to fluctuate. Some economists argue that the measured unemploy-
ment rate may sometimes seem high even though the labor market is working well. The quantity
of labor supplied at the current wage is equal to the quantity demanded at the current wage. The
fact that there are people willing to work at a wage higher than the current wage does not mean
that the labor market is not working. Whenever there is an upward-sloping supply curve in a
market (as is usually the case in the labor market), the quantity supplied at a price higher than the
equilibrium price is always greater than the quantity supplied at the equilibrium price.
Economists who view unemployment this way do not see it as a major problem. Yet the
haunting images of the bread lines in the 1930s are still with us, and many find it difficult to
believe everything was optimal when over 14 million people were counted as unemployed in
2010. There are other views of unemployment, as we will now see.
Explaining the Existence of Unemployment
If unemployment is a major macroeconomic problem—and many economists believe that it is—
then we need to explore some of the reasons that have been suggested for its existence. Among
these are sticky wages, efficiency wages, imperfect information, and minimum wage laws.
Each of these explanations for unemployment focuses on a particular reason that wage rates
do not completely adjust when the demand for labor falls. Because wage rates do not fall as far as
needed, there will be more people who wish to work at the current wage rates than there are jobs
for those people. This is what one means by unemployment.
Sticky Wages
One explanation for unemployment (above and beyond normal frictional and structural unem-
ployment) is that wages are sticky on the downward side. We described this briefly in our building
of the AS curve. This situation is illustrated in Figure 29.2, where the equilibrium wage gets stuck
at W0 (the original wage) and does not fall to W when demand decreases from D0 to D1. The
result is unemployment of the amount L0 - L1, where L0 is the quantity of labor that households
want to supply at wage rate W0 and L1 is the amount of labor that firms want to hire at wage rate
W0. L0 - L1 is the number of workers who would like to work at W0 but cannot find jobs.
The sticky wage explanation of unemployment, however, begs the question. Why are wages
sticky, if they are, and why do wages not fall to clear the labor market during periods of high
unemployment? Many answers have been proposed, but as yet no one answer has been agreed on.
This lack of consensus is one reason macroeconomics has been in a state of flux for so long. The
existence of unemployment continues to be a puzzle. Although we will discuss the major theories
that economists have proposed to explain why wages may not clear the labor market, we can offer
no conclusions. The question is still open.
Social, or Implicit, Contracts
One explanation for downwardly sticky wages is that
firms enter into social, or implicit, contracts with workers not to cut wages. It seems that
extreme events—deep recession, deregulation, or threat of bankruptcy—are necessary for
firms to cut wages. Wage cuts did occur in the Great Depression, in the airline industry fol-
lowing deregulation of the industry in the 1980s, and recently when some U.S. manufactur-
ing firms found themselves in danger of bankruptcy from stiff foreign competition. These
are exceptions to the general rule. For reasons that may be more sociological than economic,
cutting wages seems close to being a taboo. In a recent study, Truman Bewley of Yale
University surveyed hundreds of managers about why they did not reduce wage rates in
downturns. The most common response was that wage cuts hurt worker morale and thus

Unspoken agreements between

CHAPTER 29
The Labor Market In the Macroeconomy 585
negatively affect worker productivity. Breaking the taboo and cutting wages may be costly in
this sense.
A related argument, the relative-wage explanation of unemployment, holds that workers
are concerned about their wages relative to the wages of other workers in other firms and indus-
tries and may be unwilling to accept wage cuts unless they know that other workers are receiving
similar cuts. Because it is difficult to reassure any one group of workers that all other workers are
in the same situation, workers may resist any cut in their wages. There may be an implicit under-
standing between firms and workers that firms will not do anything that would make their work-
ers worse off relative to workers in other firms.
Explicit Contracts
Many workers—in particular unionized workers—sign 1- to 3-year
employment contracts with firms. These contracts stipulate the workers’ wages for each year of
the contract. Wages set in this way do not fluctuate with economic conditions, either upward or
downward. If the economy slows down and firms demand fewer workers, the wage will not fall.
Instead, some workers will be laid off.
Although explicit contracts can explain why some wages are sticky, a deeper question must
also be considered. Workers and firms surely know at the time a contract is signed that unforeseen
events may cause the wages set by the contract to be too high or too low. Why do firms and work-
ers bind themselves in this way? One explanation is that negotiating wages is costly. Negotiations
between unions and firms can take a considerable amount of time—time that could be spent pro-
ducing output—and it would be very costly to negotiate wages weekly or monthly. Contracts are a
way of bearing these costs at no more than 1-, 2-, or 3-year intervals. There is a trade-off between
the costs of locking workers and firms into contracts for long periods of time and the costs of wage
negotiations. The length of contracts that minimizes negotiation costs seems to be (from what we
observe in practice) between 1 and 3 years.
Some multiyear contracts adjust for unforeseen events by cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)
written into the contract. COLAs tie wages to changes in the cost of living: The greater the rate of
inflation, the more wages are raised. COLAs thus protect workers from unexpected inflation,
although many COLAs adjust wages by a smaller percentage than the percentage increase in prices.
Efficiency Wage Theory
Another explanation for unemployment centers on the efficiency wage theory, which holds that
the productivity of workers increases with the wage rate. If this is true, firms may have an incen-
tive to pay wages above the wage at which the quantity of labor supplied is equal to the quantity
of labor demanded.
The key argument of the efficiency wage theory is that by offering workers a wage in excess of
the market wage, the productivity of those workers is increased. Some economists have likened

In the summer of 2010 Congress considered an expansion of
the program of unemployment insurance. As the article
below suggests, one of the debates around this program was
whether the existence of such programs actually fueled
unemployment. You can see that there is a considerable
debate about the benefit of jobless benefits.
Long Recession Ignites Debate on
Jobless Benefits
The Wall Street Journal
Management Recruiters of Sacramento, Calif., says it
recently had a tough time filling six engineering positions at
an Oregon manufacturer paying $60,000 a year—and sus-
pects long-term jobless benefits were part of the hitch.
“We called several engineers that were unemployed,”
says Karl Dinse, a managing partner at the recruiting firm.
“They said, nah, you know, if it were paying $80,000 I’d think
about it.” Some candidates suggested he call them back
when their benefits were scheduled to run out, he says.
Rick Jewell has a different take on extended jobless ben-
efits: He didn’t want to be on the dole, but had no alternative.
He has been out of work since he lost his $12-an-hour job
driving a forklift for a cosmetics company in Greenwood, Ind.,
in December 2008. He collected $315 a week in benefits until
early June—when Congress declined to renew the law that
gave workers in Indiana and some other states up to
99 weeks of assistance.
“I am tired of sitting at home. I am tired of not being the
breadwinner,” says Mr. Jewell, who says he looks for work
every day. He and his wife now rely on her $480 a week job as
a distribution supervisor at the same cosmetics company.
In the long recession and the lackluster recovery, the gov-
ernment expanded unemployment payments more than at
any time since the benefits were rolled out in the 1930s. And
workers have gone jobless for longer than any time since
official tallies began in 1967.
Politicians and economists are now in a fierce debate that
could have big consequences for the jobless: Did more-
generous unemployment benefits prompt jobless workers to
be pickier in their searches? Or was the program a prudent
response to the worst recession in generations?
Economists have argued for years about the extent to
which government benefits prolong unemployment—and
possibly augment the overall jobless rate. Most believe that
expanding benefits does discourage some unemployed
people from looking for work or taking available jobs. But
they disagree on how acute that effect is, particularly at a
time when jobs are scarce.
“Given the current economic situation I doubt that effect
is very large,” says Harvard University economist Raj Chetty.
“I think people will take whatever job they can get.”
In times when jobs are scarce, Mr. Levine argues that
any disincentive to work is minimal. A recent Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco study arrived at the same
conclusion: Those who were eligible for unemployment
benefits were out of work just 1.6 weeks longer than those
who weren’t receiving benefits.

the payment of this higher wage as a gift-exchange: firms pay a wage in excess of the market wage
and in return workers work harder or more productively than they otherwise would. Under these
circumstances, there will be people who want to work at the wage paid by firms and cannot find
employment. Indeed, for the efficiency wage theory to operate, it must be the case that the wage
offered by firms is above the market wage. It is the gap between the two that motivates workers
who do have jobs to outdo themselves.

CHAPTER 29
The Labor Market In the Macroeconomy 587
Empirical studies of labor markets have identified several potential benefits that firms receive
from paying workers more than the market-clearing wage. Among them are lower turnover,
improved morale, and reduced “shirking” of work. Even though the efficiency wage theory predicts
some unemployment, the behavior it is describing is unlikely to account for much of the observed
large cyclical fluctuations in unemployment over time.
Imperfect Information
Thus far we have been assuming that firms know exactly what wage rates they need to set to clear
the labor market. They may not choose to set their wages at this level, but at least they know what
the market-clearing wage is. In practice, however, firms may not have enough information at
their disposal to know what the market-clearing wage is. In this case, firms are said to have
imperfect information. If firms have imperfect or incomplete information, they may simply set
wages wrong—wages that do not clear the labor market.
If a firm sets its wages too high, more workers will want to work for that firm than the firm
wants to employ, resulting in some potential workers being turned away. The result is, of course,
unemployment. One objection to this explanation is that it accounts for the existence of unem-
ployment only in the very short run. As soon as a firm sees that it has made a mistake, why would
it not immediately correct its mistake and adjust its wages to the correct market-clearing level?
Why would unemployment persist?
If the economy were simple, it should take no more than a few months for firms to correct
their mistakes, but the economy is complex. Although firms may be aware of their past mistakes
and may try to correct them, new events are happening all the time. Because constant change—
including a constantly changing equilibrium wage level—is characteristic of the economy, firms
may find it hard to adjust wages to the market-clearing level. The labor market is not like the
stock market or the market for wheat, where prices are determined in organized exchanges every
day. Instead, thousands of firms are setting wages and millions of workers are responding to these
wages. It may take considerable time for the market-clearing wages to be determined after they
have been disturbed from an equilibrium position.
Minimum Wage Laws
Minimum wage laws explain at least a small fraction of unemployment. These laws set a floor for
wage rates—a minimum hourly rate for any kind of labor. In 2010, the federal minimum wage
was $7.25 per hour. If the market-clearing wage for some groups of workers is below this amount,
this group will be unemployed. In Figure 29.2, if the minimum wage is W0 and the market-
clearing wage is W*, the number of unemployed will be L0 - L1.
Teenagers, who have relatively little job experience, are most likely to be hurt by minimum
wage laws. If some teenagers can produce only $6.90 worth of output per hour, no firm would be
willing to hire them at a wage of $7.25. To do so would incur a loss of $0.35 per hour. In an unreg-
ulated market, these teenagers would be able to find work at the market-clearing wage of
$6.90 per hour. If the minimum wage laws prevent the wage from falling below $7.35, these work-
ers will not be able to find jobs and they will be unemployed. Others who may be hurt include
people with very low skills and some recent immigrants.
Some economists and political observers believe that one of the causes of unemployment is
government programs, like unemployment insurance, that reduce the costs of being jobless. The
Economics in Practice on p. 586 describes the debate on the role of jobless benefits in the most
recent recession.
An Open Question
As we have seen, there are many explanations for why the labor market may not clear. The theo-
ries we have just set forth are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and there may be elements of
truth in all of them. The aggregate labor market is very complicated, and there are no simple
answers to why there is unemployment. Much current work in macroeconomics is concerned
directly or indirectly with this question, and it is an exciting area of study. Which argument or
arguments will win out in the end is an open question.

PART V
The Core of Macroeconomic Theory 
The Short-Run Relationship Between the
Unemployment Rate and Inflation
At the Boston Fed in June 2008, Ben Bernanke, the Fed chair, gave a speech in which he referred
to both the “upside risk to inflation,” and the “unwelcome rise in the unemployment rate.”
Unemployment and inflation are the two central concerns of macroeconomics and of policy
makers like Bernanke. But what is the relationship between the two? When Bernanke chooses to
fight inflation, is he inevitably increasing unemployment and visa versa? We are now in a position
to tackle this question.
We begin by looking at the relation between aggregate output (income) (Y) and the unem-
ployment rate (U). For an economy to increase aggregate output, firms must hire more labor to
produce that output. Thus, more output implies greater employment. An increase in employment
means more people working (fewer people unemployed) and a lower unemployment rate. An
increase in Y corresponds to a decrease in U. Thus, U and Y are negatively related: when Y rises, the
unemployment rate falls, and when Y falls, the unemployment rate rises.
What about the relationship between aggregate output and the overall price level? The AS curve,
reproduced in Figure 29.3, shows the relationship between Y and the overall price level (P). The rela-
tionship is a positive one: When P increases, Y increases, and when P decreases, Y decreases.
As you will recall from the last chapter, the shape of the AS curve is determined by the behav-
ior of the firms and how they react to an increase in demand. If aggregate demand shifts to the
right and the economy is operating on the nearly flat part of the AS curve—far from capacity—
output will increase, but the price level will not change much. However, if the economy is operat-
ing on the steep part of the AS curve—close to capacity—an increase in demand will drive up the
price level, but output will be constrained by capacity and will not increase much.
Now let us put the two pieces together and think about what will happen following an event
that leads to an increase in aggregate demand. First, firms experience an unanticipated decline in
inventories. They respond by increasing output (Y) and hiring workers—the unemployment rate
falls. If the economy is not close to capacity, there will be little increase in the price level. If, how-
ever, aggregate demand continues to grow, the ability of the economy to increase output will
eventually reach its limit. As aggregate demand shifts farther and farther to the right along the AS
curve, the price level increases more and more and output begins to reach its limit. At the point at
which the AS curve becomes vertical, output cannot rise any farther. If output cannot grow, the
unemployment rate cannot be pushed any lower. There is a negative relationship between 
the unemployment rate and the price level. As the unemployment rate declines in response to the
economy’s moving closer and closer to capacity output, the overall price level rises more and
more, as shown in Figure 29.4.
The AS curve in Figure 29.3 shows the relationship between the price level and aggregate out-
put and thus implicitly between the price level and the unemployment rate, which is depicted in
Figure 29.4. In policy formulation and discussions, however, economists have focused less on the
relationship between the price level and the unemployment rate than on the relationship between

the inflation rate—the percentage change in the price level—and the unemployment rate. Note
that the price level and the percentage change in the price level are not the same. The curve describ-
ing the relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate, which is shown in
Figure 29.5, is called the Phillips Curve, after British economist A.W. Phillips, who first examined it
using data for the United Kingdom. Fortunately, the analysis behind the AS curve (and thus the
analysis behind the curve in Figure 29.4) will enable us to see both why the Phillips Curve initially
looked so appealing as an explanation of the relationship between inflation and the unemployment
rate and how more recent history has changed our views of the interpretation of the Phillips Curve.
The Phillips Curve: A Historical Perspective
In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a remarkably smooth relationship between the unemploy-
ment rate and the rate of inflation, as Figure 29.6 shows for the 1960s. As you can see, the data
points fit fairly closely around a downward-sloping curve; in general, the higher the unemploy-
ment rate is, the lower the rate of inflation. The Phillips Curve in Figure 29.6 shows a trade-off
between inflation and unemployment. The curve says that to lower the inflation rate, we must
accept a higher unemployment rate, and to lower the unemployment rate, we must accept a
higher rate of inflation.
Textbooks written in the 1960s and early 1970s relied on the Phillips Curve as the main
explanation of inflation. Things seemed simple—inflation appeared to respond in a fairly pre-
dictable way to changes in the unemployment rate. Policy discussions in the 1960s often revolved
around the Phillips Curve. The role of the policy maker, it was thought, was to choose a point on
the curve. Conservatives usually argued for choosing a point with a low rate of inflation and were
willing to accept a higher unemployment rate in exchange for this. Liberals usually argued for
accepting more inflation to keep unemployment at a low level.

Life did not turn out to be quite so simple. The Phillips Curve broke down in the 1970s and
1980s. This change can be seen in Figure 29.7, which graphs the unemployment rate and inflation
rate for the period from 1970 to 2009. The points in Figure 29.7 show no particular relationship
between inflation and the unemployment rate.
Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand Analysis and the
Phillips Curve
How can we explain the stability of the Phillips Curve in the 1950s and 1960s and the lack of sta-
bility after that? To answer, we need to return to AS/AD analysis.
If the AD curve shifts from year to year but the AS curve does not, the values of P and Y each
year will lie along the AS curve [Figure 29.8(a)]. The plot of the relationship between P and Y will
be upward sloping. Correspondingly, the plot of the relationship between the unemployment
rate (which decreases with increased output) and the rate of inflation will be a curve that slopes

downward. In other words, we would expect to see a negative relationship between the unem-
ployment rate and the inflation rate.
However, the relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate will look
different if the AS curve shifts from year to year but the AD curve does not. A leftward shift of
the AS curve will cause an increase in the price level (P) and a decrease in aggregate output (Y)
[Figure 29.8(b)]. When the AS curve shifts to the left, the economy experiences both inflation
and an increase in the unemployment rate (because decreased output means increased unem-
ployment). In other words, if the AS curve is shifting from year to year, we would expect to see a
positive relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.
If both the AS and the AD curves are shifting simultaneously, however, there is no systematic
relationship between P and Y [Figure 29.8(c)] and thus no systematic relationship between the
unemployment rate and the inflation rate. One explanation for the change in the Phillips Curve
between the 1960s and later periods is that both the AS and the AD curves appear to be shifting in
the later periods—both shifts from the supply side and shifts from the demand side. This can be
seen by examining a key cost variable: the price of imports.
The Role of Import Prices
We discussed in the previous chapter that some of the main
factors that causes the AS curve to shift are energy prices, particularly the price of oil. Since the
United States imports much of its oil, the price index of U.S. imports is highly correlated with the
(world) price of oil. We can thus consider that a change in the U.S. import price index, which we
will call “the price of imports,” shifts the AS curve. The price of imports is plotted in Figure 29.9
for the 1960 I–2010 I period. As you can see, the price of imports changed very little between
1960 and 1970. There were no large shifts in the AS curve in the 1960s due to changes in the price
of imports. There were also no other large changes in input prices in the 1960s, so overall the
AS curve shifted very little during the decade. The main variation in the 1960s was in aggregate
demand, so the shifting AD curve traced out points along the AS curve.
Figure 29.9 also shows that the price of imports increased considerably in the 1970s. This rise
led to large shifts in the AS curve during the decade, but the AD curve was also shifting through-
out the 1970s. With both curves shifting, the data points for P and Y were scattered all over the
graph and the observed relationship between P and Y was not at all systematic.
This story about import prices and the AS and AD curves in the 1960s and 1970s carries
over to the Phillips Curve. The Phillips Curve was stable in the 1960s because the primary source
of variation in the economy was demand, not costs. In the 1970s, both demand and costs were
varying so no obvious relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate was

apparent. To some extent, what is remarkable about the Phillips Curve is not that it was not
smooth after the 1960s, but that it ever was smooth.
Expectations and the Phillips Curve
Another reason the Phillips Curve is not stable concerns expectations. We saw in Chapter 28 that
if a firm expects other firms to raise their prices, the firm may raise the price of its own product.
If all firms are behaving this way, prices will rise because they are expected to rise. In this sense,
expectations are self-fulfilling. Similarly, if inflation is expected to be high in the future, negoti-
ated wages are likely to be higher than if inflation is expected to be low. Wage inflation is thus
affected by expectations of future price inflation. Because wages are input costs, prices rise as
firms respond to the higher wage costs. Price expectations that affect wage contracts eventually
affect prices themselves.
If the rate of inflation depends on expectations, the Phillips Curve will shift as expectations
change. For example, if inflationary expectations increase, the result will be an increase in the rate
of inflation even though the unemployment rate may not have changed. In this case, the Phillips
Curve will shift to the right. If inflationary expectations decrease, the Phillips Curve will shift to
the left—there will be less inflation at any given level of the unemployment rate.
It so happened that inflationary expectations were quite stable in the 1950s and 1960s. The
inflation rate was moderate during most of this period, and people expected it to remain moder-
ate. With inflationary expectations not changing very much, there were no major shifts of the
Phillips Curve, a situation that helps explain its stability during the period.
Near the end of the 1960s, inflationary expectations began to increase, primarily in response
to the actual increase in inflation that was occurring because of the tight economy caused by the
Vietnam War. Inflationary expectations increased even further in the 1970s as a result of large oil
price increases. These changing expectations led to shifts of the Phillips Curve and are another
reason the curve was not stable during the 1970s.
Inflation and Aggregate Demand
It is important to realize that the fact that the Phillips Curve broke down during the 1970s does
not mean that aggregate demand has no effect on inflation. It simply means that inflation is
affected by more than just aggregate demand. If, say, inflation is also affected by cost variables like
the price of imports, there will be no stable relationship between just inflation and aggregate
demand unless the cost variables are not changing. Similarly, if the unemployment rate is taken to
be a measure of aggregate demand, where inflation depends on both the unemployment rate and
cost variables, there will be no stable Phillips Curve unless the cost variables are not changing.
Therefore, the unemployment rate can have an important effect on inflation even though this
will not be evident from a plot of inflation against the unemployment rate—that is, from the
Phillips Curve.

The price of imports changed very little in the 1960s and early 1970s. It increased substantially in 1974 and again
in 1979–1980. Between 1981 and 2002, the price of imports changed very little. It generally rose between 2003
and 2008, with some falloff in 2009. 

CHAPTER 29
The Labor Market In the Macroeconomy 593
The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve,
Potential Output, and the Natural Rate of
Unemployment
Thus far we have been discussing the relationship between inflation and unemployment, looking
at the short-run AS and AD curves. We turn now to look at the long run, focusing on the connec-
tion between output and unemployment.
Recall from Chapter 28 that many economists believe that in the long run, the AS curve is
vertical. We have illustrated this case in Figure 29.10. Assume that the initial equilibrium is at the
intersection of AD0 and the long-run aggregate supply curve. Now consider a shift of the aggre-
gate demand curve from AD0 to AD1. If wages are sticky and lag prices, in the short-run, aggre-
gate output will rise from Y0 to Y1. (This is a movement along the short-run AS curve AS0.) In the
longer run, wages catch up. For example, next year’s labor contracts may make up for the fact that
wage increases did not keep up with the cost of living this year. If wages catch up in the longer
run, the AS curve will shift from AS0 to AS1 and drive aggregate output back to Y0. If wages ulti-
mately rise by exactly the same percentage as output prices, firms will produce the same level of
output as they did before the increase in aggregate demand.
In Chapter 28, we said that Y0 is sometimes called potential output. Aggregate output can be
pushed above Y0 in the short run. When aggregate output exceeds Y0, however, there is upward
pressure on input prices and costs. The unemployment rate is already quite low, firms are begin-
ning to encounter the limits of their plant capacities, and so on. At levels of aggregate output
above Y0, costs will rise, the AS curve will shift to the left, and the price level will rise. Thus, poten-
tial output is the level of aggregate output that can be sustained in the long run without inflation.
This story is directly related to the Phillips Curve. Those who believe that the AS curve is vertical
in the long run at potential output also believe that the Phillips Curve is vertical in the long run at
some natural rate of unemployment. Changes in aggregate demand—including increases in govern-
ment spending—increase prices, but do not change employment. Recall from Chapter 22 that the
natural rate of unemployment refers to unemployment that occurs as a normal part of the func-
tioning of the economy. It is sometimes taken as the sum of frictional unemployment and structural
unemployment.The logic behind the vertical Phillips Curve is that whenever the unemployment rate

If the AS curve is vertical in the long run, so is the Phillips Curve. In the long run, the Phillips Curve corre-
sponds to the natural rate of unemployment—that is, the unemployment rate that is consistent with the
notion of a fixed long-run output at potential output. U* is the natural rate of unemployment.

is pushed below the natural rate, wages begin to rise, thus pushing up costs. This leads to a lower level
of output, which pushes the unemployment rate back up to the natural rate. At the natural rate, the
economy can be considered to be at full employment.
The Nonaccelerating Inflation Rate of 
Unemployment (NAIRU)
In Figure 29.10, the long-run vertical Phillips Curve is a graph with the inflation rate on the ver-
tical axis and the unemployment rate on the horizontal axis. The natural rate of unemployment
is U*. In the long run, with a long-run vertical Phillips Curve, the actual unemployment rate
moves to U* because of the natural workings of the economy.
Another graph of interest is Figure 29.11, which plots the change in the inflation rate on the
vertical axis and the unemployment rate on the horizontal axis. Many economists believe that
the relationship between the change in the inflation rate and the unemployment rate is as
depicted by the PP curve in the figure. The value of the unemployment rate where the PP curve
crosses zero is called the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). If the actual
unemployment rate is to the left of the NAIRU, the change in the inflation rate will be positive.
As depicted in the figure, at U1, the change in the inflation rate is 1. Conversely, if the actual
unemployment rate is to the right of the NAIRU, the change in the inflation rate is negative: At
U2, the change is -1.
Consider what happens if the unemployment rate decreases from the NAIRU to U1 and
stays at U1 for many periods. Assume also that the inflation rate at the NAIRU is 2 percent.
Then in the first period the inflation rate will increase from 2 percent to 3 percent. The infla-
tion rate does not, however, just stay at the higher 3 percent value. In the next period, the
inflation rate will increase from 3 percent to 4 percent and so on. The price level will be
accelerating—that is, the change in the inflation rate will be positive—when the actual
unemployment rate is below the NAIRU. Conversely, the price level will be decelerating—that
is, the change in the inflation rate will be negative—when the actual unemployment rate is
above the NAIRU.1
The PP curve in Figure 29.11 is like the AS curve in Figure 29.3—the same factors that shift
the AS curve, such as cost shocks, can also shift the PP curve. Figure 28.8 on p. 569 summarizes the
various factors that can cause the AS curve to shift, and these are also relevant for the PP curve.
A favorable shift for the PP curve is to the left because the PP curve crosses zero at a lower
1 The NAIRU is actually misnamed. It is the price level that is accelerating or decelerating, not the inflation rate, when the actual
unemployment rate differs from the NAIRU. The inflation rate is not accelerating or decelerating, but simply changing by the
same amount each period. The namers of the NAIRU forgot their physics.

unemployment rate, indicating that the NAIRU is lower. Some have argued that one possible
recent source of favorable shifts is increased foreign competition, which may have kept wage costs
and other input costs down.
Before about 1995, proponents of the NAIRU theory argued that the value of the NAIRU in
the United States was around 6 percent. By the end of 1995, the unemployment rate declined to
5.6 percent, and by 2000, the unemployment rate was down to 3.8 percent. If the NAIRU had
been 6 percent, one should have seen a continuing increase in the inflation rate beginning about
1995. In fact, the 1995 to 2000 period saw slightly declining inflation. Not only did inflation not
continually increase, it did not even increase once to a new, higher value and then stay there. As
the unemployment rate declined during this period, proponents of the NAIRU lowered their esti-
mates of it, more or less in line with the actual fall in the unemployment rate. This recalibration
can be justified by arguing that there have been continuing favorable shifts of the PP curve, such
as possible increased foreign competition. Critics, however, have argued that this procedure is
close to making the NAIRU theory vacuous. Can the theory really be tested if the estimate of the
NAIRU is changed whenever it is not consistent with the data? How trustworthy is the appeal to
favorable shifts?
Macroeconomists are currently debating whether equations estimated under the NAIRU
theory are good approximations. More time is needed before any definitive answers can be given.
Looking Ahead
This chapter concludes our basic analysis of how the macroeconomy works. In the preceding seven
chapters, we have examined how households and firms behave in the three market arenas—the
goods market, the money market, and the labor market. We have seen how aggregate output
(income), the interest rate, and the price level are determined in the economy, and we have exam-
ined the relationship between two of the most important macroeconomic variables, the inflation
rate and the unemployment rate. In Chapter 30, we use everything we have learned up to this point
to examine a number of important policy issues.
THE LABOR MARKET: BASIC CONCEPTS p. 581
1. Because the economy is dynamic, frictional and structural
unemployment are inevitable and in some ways desirable.
Times of cyclical unemployment are of concern to macroeco-
nomic policy makers.
2. In general, employment tends to fall when aggregate output
falls and rise when aggregate output rises.
THE CLASSICAL VIEW OF THE LABOR MARKET p. 582
3. Classical economists believe that the interaction of supply
and demand in the labor market brings about equilibrium
and that unemployment (beyond the frictional and struc-
tural amounts) does not exist.
4. The classical view of the labor market is consistent with the
theory of a vertical aggregate supply curve.
EXPLAINING THE EXISTENCE OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT p. 584
5. Some economists argue that the unemployment rate is not
an accurate indicator of whether the labor market is working
properly. Unemployed people who are considered part of the
labor force may be offered jobs but may be unwilling to take
those jobs at the offered salaries. Some of the unemployed
may have chosen not to work, but this result does not mean
that the labor market has malfunctioned.
6. Those who do not subscribe to the classical view of the labor
market suggest several reasons why unemployment exists.
Downwardly sticky wages may be brought about by social
(implicit) or explicit contracts not to cut wages. If the equilib-
rium wage rate falls but wages are prevented from falling
also, the result will be unemployment.
7. Efficiency wage theory holds that the productivity of workers
increases with the wage rate. If this is true, firms may have an
incentive to pay wages above the wage at which the quantity
of labor supplied is equal to the quantity of labor demanded.
At all wages above the equilibrium, there will be an excess
supply of labor and therefore unemployment.
8. If firms are operating with incomplete or imperfect informa-
tion, they may not know what the market-clearing wage is. As
a result, they may set their wages incorrectly and bring about
unemployment. Because the economy is so complex, it may
take considerable time for firms to correct these mistakes.
9. Minimum wage laws, which set a floor for wage rates, are one
factor contributing to unemployment of teenagers and very
low-skilled workers. If the market-clearing wage for some
groups of workers is below the minimum wage, some mem-
bers of this group will be unemployed.

THE SHORT-RUN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND INFLATION p. 588 
10. There is a negative relationship between the unemployment
rate (U) and aggregate output (income) (Y): When Y rises,
U falls. When Y falls, U rises.
11. The relationship between the unemployment rate and the
price level is negative: As the unemployment rate declines
and the economy moves closer to capacity, the price level
rises more and more.
12. The Phillips Curve represents the relationship between the
inflation rate and the unemployment rate. During the 1950s
and 1960s, this relationship was stable and there seemed to
be a predictable trade-off between inflation and unemploy-
ment. As a result of import price increases (which led to
shifts in aggregate supply), the relationship between the
inflation rate and the unemployment rate was erratic in the
1970s. Inflation depends on more than just the unemploy-
ment rate.
THE LONG-RUN AGGREGATE SUPPLY CURVE,
POTENTIAL OUTPUT, AND THE NATURAL RATE OF
UNEMPLOYMENT p. 593
13. Those who believe that the AS curve is vertical in the long
run also believe that the Phillips Curve is vertical in the long
run at the natural rate of unemployment. The natural rate is
generally the sum of the frictional and structural rates. If the
Phillips Curve is vertical in the long run, then there is a limit
to how low government policy can push the unemployment
rate without setting off inflation.
14. The NAIRU theory says that the price level will accelerate
when the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU and decel-
erate when the unemployment rate is above the NAIRU.

which a person can receive unemployment benefits directly
affects the unemployment rate, and whether your answer applies
to both 2007 and 2010. Look up the current unemployment rates
in each of the five countries. Discuss whether a positive relation-
ship still exists between the duration of unemployment benefits
and the unemployment rate, and whether you believe the exten-
sion of unemployment benefits in three of those countries
played a role in their current unemployment rates.
3. Obtain monthly data on the unemployment rate and the infla-
tion rate for the last 2 years. (This data can be found at
www.bls.gov or in a recent issue of the Survey of Current
Business or in the Monthly Labor Review or Employment and
Earnings, all published by the government and available in many
college libraries.)
1. In April 2000, the U.S. unemployment rate dropped below 
4 percent for the first time in 30 years. At the same time, infla-
tion remained at a very low level by historical standards. Can
you offer an explanation for what seems to be an improved
trade-off between inflation and unemployment? What factors
might improve the trade-off? What factors might make it worse?
2. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 586] Economists
and politicians have long debated the extent to which unemploy-
ment benefits affect the duration of unemployment. The table
below presents unemployment and unemployment benefit data
for five high-income countries. The unemployment rate and the
duration of unemployment benefits for each of the countries are
shown for 2007, prior to the recession of 2008–2009, and for July
2010. As the data shows, three of these countries extended the
duration of unemployment benefits as a result of the recession.
The data for both 2007 and 2010 show a positive relationship

variables? Provide an explanation.
4. In 2010, the country of Ruba was suffering from a period of
high unemployment. The new president, Clang, appointed
Laurel Tiedye as his chief economist. Ms. Tiedye and her staff
estimated these supply and demand curves for labor from data
obtained from the secretary of labor, Robert Small:
where Q is the quantity of labor supplied/demanded in millions
of workers and W is the wage rate in slugs, the currency of Ruba.
a. Currently, the law in Ruba says that no worker shall be paid less
than 9 slugs per hour. Estimate the quantity of labor supplied,
the number of unemployed, and the unemployment rate.
b. President Clang, over the objection of Secretary Small, has
recommended to the congress that the law be changed to
allow the wage rate to be determined in the market. If such a
law was passed and the market adjusted quickly, what would
happen to total employment, the size of the labor force, and
the unemployment rate? Show the results graphically.
c. Will the Rubanese labor market adjust quickly to such a
change in the law? Why or why not?
5. The following policies have at times been advocated for coping
with unemployment. Briefly explain how each might work and
explain which type or types of unemployment (frictional, struc-
tural, or cyclical) each policy is designed to alter.
a. A computer list of job openings and a service that matches
employees with job vacancies (sometimes called an “economic
dating service”)
b. Lower minimum wage for teenagers
c. Retraining programs for workers who need to learn new
skills to find employment
d. Public employment for people without jobs
e. Improved information about available jobs and current
wage rates
f. The president’s going on nationwide TV and attempting to
convince firms and workers that the inflation rate next year
will be low

that you are worse off with the wage increase than you were
before? Explain your answer.
7. How will the following affect labor force participation rates,
labor supply, and unemployment?

ers” and the unemployment rate for your state or area over a
recent 2-year period. Has unemployment increased or
decreased? What has happened to wages? Does the pattern of
unemployment help explain the movement of wages? Provide
an explanation.
10. Suppose the inflation–unemployment relationship depicted by
the Phillips Curve was stable. Do you think the U.S. trade-off
and the Japanese trade-off would be identical? If not, what
kinds of factors might make the trade-offs dissimilar?
11. The unemployment rate stood at 9.6 percent late in 2010.
Despite the fact that the economy had been growing out of the
recession for over a year (real GDP was up 3 percent by Q2
2010), there was only modest job growth during 2010. While a
fiscal stimulus package provided some help, labor was “stuck in
the mud.” Which of the following factors contributed to the
problem and which ones were important?
a. Employment and unemployment are always lagging indica-
tors since it is difficult to hire and fire in a downturn.
b. Productivity has grown considerably this decade; people are
working hard and being paid less—in short, firms are “mean
and lean.”
c. Construction employment, which is a traditional engine of
growth in recoveries, has gone nowhere largely because of
the fact that we dramatically overbuilt.
d. We have minimum wage laws in the United States.
e. Wages are sticky on the downward side, preventing the labor
market from clearing.
f. The Census Bureau hired and then fired thousands of work-
ers, throwing all the numbers off.
Choose two of these statements and write a short essay. Use
data to support your claims.

Use a labor market graph to show the effect of social contracts on
wages and on unemployment if the economy enters a recession.

We have seen that fiscal policy can
affect the economy through tax and
spending changes and that monetary
policy can affect the economy
through interest rate changes. Given
that this has been known for many
decades, you might ask why fluctua-
tions in the economy are still so
large? From Figure 20.5 on p. 418,
you can see that there have been
large fluctuations in the unemploy-
ment rate since 1990. Why can’t pol-
icy makers do better? This chapter
covers a number of topics, but they
are all concerned at least indirectly
with trying to help answer this question. We will be considering the various constraints that pol-
icy makers face in trying to stabilize the economy.
The structure of the chapter is as follows. In the next section we will consider the stock mar-
ket and the housing market. We will see that both of these markets have important effects on the
economy through a household wealth effect. When, say, stock prices or housing prices rise,
household wealth rises, and households respond to this by consuming more. Stock prices and
housing prices are asset prices, and changes in these prices are, for the most part, unpredictable.
Neither policy makers nor anyone else in the economy has the ability to predict how the stock
and housing markets will behave in the future. This is then the first problem that policy makers
face. If stock and housing prices have important effects on the economy and if changes in these
prices are unpredictable, there is an important source of variation that policy makers can do
nothing about. At best, policy makers can try to react quickly to these changes once they occur.
We also discuss in this section what is meant by “financial crises” and what policy makers can and
cannot do about them.
A second problem with trying to stabilize the economy is getting the timing right. This is
the subject matter of the second section. We will see that there is a danger of overreacting to
changes in the economy—m1aking the fluctuations in the economy even worse than they other-
wise would be.
The third section considers government deficit issues.We discussed at the end of Chapter 28 that
it is important to distinguish between cyclical deficits and structural deficits.One expects that the gov-
ernment will run a deficit in a recession since tax revenue is down because of the sluggish economy
and spending may be up as the government tries to stimulate the economy. If at full employment the
government would still be running a deficit, this part of the deficit is the structural deficit.
In 2010 many countries, including the United States, faced serious structural deficit prob-
lems. We discuss various problems that may arise if a government runs large deficits year after
year. We will see, returning to the subject matter of the first section, that one possible reaction is
a financial crisis. The U.S. government also ran large structural deficits in the 1980s, and we con-
clude with a discussion of this period. There was an attempt in the late 1980s to legislate a
requirement that the budget be balanced, and we examine how stabilization policy is affected
under such a requirement.
Financial Crises,
Stabilization,
and Deficits

The Stock Market, the Housing Market, and
Financial Crises
Introductory macroeconomic textbooks written before 1990 could largely ignore the stock and
housing markets. The effects of these markets on the macroeconomy were small enough to be put
aside in introductory discussions. This changed in the 1990s for the stock market and after 2000
for the housing market. The stock market contributed to the boom in the last half of the 1990s
and to the recession that followed. The housing market contributed to the expansion in
2002–2007 and to the recession that followed. For this reason, even introductory macroeconom-
ics courses must spend some time looking at these two markets. We first turn to some back-
ground material on the stock market.
Stocks and Bonds
It will be useful to begin by briefly discussing the three main ways in which firms borrow or raise
money to finance their investments. How do firms use financial markets in practice?
When a firm wants to make a large purchase to build a new factory or buy machines,it often can-
not pay for the purchase out of its own funds. In this case, it must “finance” the investment. One way
to do this is to borrow from a bank. The bank loans the money to the firm, the firms uses the money
to buy the factory or machine, and the firm pays back the loan (with interest) to the bank over time.
Another possible way for a firm to borrow money is for the firm to issue a bond. If you buy a
bond from a firm, you are making a loan to the firm. Bonds were discussed at the beginning of
Chapter 26.
A third way for a firm to finance an investment is for it to issue additional shares of stock.
When a firm issues new shares of stock, it does not add to its debt. Instead, it brings in additional
owners of the firm, owners who agree to supply it with funds. Such owners are treated differently
than bondholders, who are owed the amount they have loaned.
A share of common stock is a certificate that represents the ownership of a share of a business,
almost always a corporation. For example, Lincoln Electric is a Cleveland-based company that
makes welding and cutting equipment. The company has 41 million shares of common stock that
are owned by tens of thousands of shareholders, some of whom are simply private individuals,
some of whom are institutions such as Carleton College, and some of whom may be employees of
the firm. Shareholders are entitled to a share of the company’s profit. When profits are paid
directly to shareholders, the payment is called a dividend. In a recent year, Lincoln Electric made
a profit of $54 million, which was $1.31 per share, of which $0.43 was paid out to shareholders as
dividends and the rest was retained for investment.
Stockholders who own stocks that increase in value earn what are called capital gains.
Realized capital gains (or losses) are increases (or decreases) in the value of assets, including
stocks, that households receive when they actually sell those assets. The government considers
realized capital gains net of losses to be income, although their treatment under the tax code has
been very complex and subject to change every few years. The total return that an owner of a
share of stock receives is the sum of the dividends received and the capital gain or loss.
Determining the Price of a Stock
What determines the price of a stock? If a share of stock is selling for $25, why is someone willing
to pay that much for it? As we have noted, when you buy a share of stock, you own part of the firm.
If a firm is making profits, it may be paying dividends to its shareholders. If it is not paying divi-
dends but is making profits, people may expect that it will pay dividends in the future. Dividends
are important in thinking about stocks because dividends are the form in which shareholders
receive income from the firm. So one thing that is likely to affect the price of a stock is what people
expect its future dividends will be. The larger the expected future dividends, the larger the current
stock price, other things being equal.
Another important consideration in thinking about the price of a stock is the time the divi-
dends are expected to be paid. A $2 per share dividend that is expected to be paid 4 years from
now is worth less than a $2 per share dividend that is expected to be paid next year. In other
words, the farther into the future the dividend is expected to be paid, the more it will be

Financial Crises, Stabilization, and Deficits 601
“discounted.” The amount by which expected future dividends are discounted depends on the
interest rate. The larger the interest rate, the more expected future dividends will be discounted.
If the interest rate is 10 percent, I can invest $100 today and receive $110 a year from now. I am
thus willing to pay $100 today to someone who will pay me $110 in a year. If instead, the interest
rate were only 5 percent, I would be willing to pay $104.76 today to receive $110 a year from now
because the alternative of $104.76 today at a 5 percent interest rate also yields $110.00 at the end
of the year. I am thus willing to pay more for the promise of $110 a year from now when the inter-
est rate is lower. In other words, I “discount” the $110 less when the interest rate is lower.
Another discount factor aside from the interest rate must be taken into account; it is the dis-
count for risk. People prefer certain outcomes to uncertain ones for the same expected values. For
example, I prefer a certain $50 over a bet in which there is a 50 percent chance I will get $100 and
a 50 percent chance I will get nothing. The expected value of the bet is $50, but I prefer the certain
$50 over the bet, where there is a 50 percent chance that I will end up with nothing. The same rea-
soning holds for future dividends. If, say, I expect dividends for both firms A and B to be $2 per
share next year but firm B has a much wider range of possibilities (is riskier), I will prefer firm A.
Put another way, I will “discount” firm B’s expected future dividends more than firm A’s because
the outcome for firm B is more uncertain.
We can thus say that the price of a stock should equal the discounted value of its expected
future dividends, where the discount factors depend on the interest rate and risk. If for some rea-
son (say, a positive surprise news announcement from the firm) expected future dividends
increase, this development should lead to an increase in the price of the stock. If the interest rate
falls, this decrease should also lead to a stock price increase. Finally, if the perceived risk of a firm
falls, this perception should increase the firm’s stock price.
Some stock analysts talk about the possibility of stock market “bubbles.” Given the preceding
discussion, what might a bubble be? Assume that given your expectations about the future divi-
dends of a firm and given the discount rate, you value the firm’s stock at $20 per share. Is there
any case in which you would pay more than $20 for a share? You can, of course, buy the stock and
sell it later; you don’t need to hold the stock forever. If the stock is currently selling for $25, which
is above your value of $20, but you think that the stock will rise to $30 in the next few months,
you might buy it now in anticipation of selling it later for a higher price. If others have similar
views, the price of the stock may be driven up.
In this case, what counts is not the discounted value of expected future dividends, but rather
your view of what others will pay for the stock in the future. If everyone expects that everyone else
expects that the price will be driven up, the price may be driven up. One might call this outcome a
bubble because the stock price depends on what people expect that other people expect and so on.
When a firm’s stock price has risen rapidly,it is difficult to know whether the reason is that people
have increased their expectations of the firm’s future dividends or that there is a bubble. Because peo-
ple’s expectations of future dividends are not directly observed, it is hard to test alternative theories.
The Stock Market Since 1948
If you follow the stock market at all, you know that much attention is paid to two stock price indices:
the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ Composite. From a macroeconomic per-
spective, however, these two indices cover too small a sample of firms. One would like an index that
includes firms whose total market value is close to the market value of all firms in the economy. For
this purpose a much better measure is the Standard and Poor’s 500 stock price index, called the
S&P 500. This index includes most of the companies in the economy by market value.
The S&P 500 index is plotted in Figure 30.1 for 1948 I–2010 I. What perhaps stands out most
in this plot is the huge increase in the index between 1995 and 2000. Between December 31, 1994,
and March 31, 2000, the S&P 500 index rose 226 percent, an annual rate of increase of 25 percent.
This is by far the largest stock market boom in U.S. history, completely dominating the boom of
the 1920s. Remember that we are talking about the S&P 500 index, which includes most of the
firms in the U.S. economy by market value. We are not talking about just a few dot-com compa-
nies. The entire stock market went up 25 percent per year for 5 years! This boom added roughly
$14 trillion to household wealth, about $2.5 trillion per year.
What caused this boom? You can see from Figure 28.13 on p. 575 that interest rates did not
change much in the last half of the 1990s, so the boom cannot be explained by any large fall in

interest rates. Perhaps profits rose substantially during this period, and this growth led to a large
increase in expected future dividends? We know from the preceding discussion that if expected
future dividends increase, stock prices should increase. Figure 30.2 plots for 1948 I–2010 I the ratio
of after-tax profits to GDP. It is clear from the figure that nothing unusual happened in the last half
of the 1990s. The share of after-tax profits in GDP rose from the middle of 1995 to the middle of
1997, but then generally fell after that through 2000. Thus, there does not appear to be any surge of
profits that would have led people to expect much higher future dividends.
It could be that the perceived riskiness of stocks fell in the last half of the 1990s. This change
would have led to smaller discount rates for stocks and thus, other things being equal, to higher
stock prices. Although this possibility cannot be completely ruled out, there is no strong indepen-
dent evidence that perceived riskiness fell.
The stock market boom is thus a puzzle, and many people speculate that it was simply a bubble.
For some reason, stock prices started rising rapidly in 1995 and people expected that other people
expected that prices would continue to rise. This led stock prices to rise further, thus fulfilling the
expectations,which led to expectations of further increases,and so on.Bubble believers note that once
stock prices started falling in 2000, they fell a great deal. It is not the case that stock prices just leveled
out in 2000; they fell rapidly. People of the bubble view argue that this is simply the bubble bursting.
The first problem then for the stability of the macroeconomy are the large and seemingly unpre-
dictable swings in the stock market.The Economics in Practice on p.603 describes the Fed’s interest in
bubbles.As we will see, these swings induce behavior changes by households and firms that affect the
real economy. Before we explore this link, we turn to a second volatile series: housing prices.

CHAPTER 30
Financial Crises, Stabilization, and Deficits 603
We discussed in the text that the huge increase in U.S. stock
prices in the last half of the 1990s is a puzzle. So also is the
huge increase in U.S. housing prices between 2002 and 2006.
Recently, many other countries also have seen large increases
in asset prices. An interesting question is whether these rapid
run-ups in prices are bubbles, generated by irrational con-
sumers and investors, or are instead the result of actions of
rational investors that simply turned out with hindsight to be
wrong. This question is of interest to both academics and
policy makers. A key policy question is whether the Fed
should ignore asset prices or try to use interest rates to con-
trol them. The following article discusses some research that
is currently being done on bubbles and its implications for
Fed behavior.
Bernanke’s Bubble Laboratory: Princeton

The Wall Street Journal
PRINCETON, N.J.—First came that tech-stock bubble. Then
there were bubbles in housing and credit. Chinese stocks took
off like a rocket. Now, as prices soar on every material from oil
to corn, some suggest there’s a bubble in commodities.
But how and why do bubbles form? Economists tradi-
tionally haven’t offered much insight. From World War II till
the mid-1990s, there weren’t many U.S. investing manias for
them to look at. The study of bubbles was left to economic
historians sifting through musty records of 17th-century
Dutch tulip-bulb prices and the like.
The dot-com boom began to change that. “You were see-
ing live, in action, the unfolding of lots of examples of valuations
disconnecting from fundamentals,” says Princeton economist
Harrison Hong. Now, the study of financial bubbles is hot.
Its hub is Princeton, 40 miles south of Wall Street, home to
a band of young scholars hired by former professor Ben
Bernanke, now the nation’s chief bubble watcher as Federal
Reserve chairman. The group includes Mr. Hong, a Vietnam
native raised in Silicon Valley; a Chinese wunderkind who
started as a physicist [Wei Xiong]; and a German who’d been
groomed to take over the family carpentry business [Markus
Brunnermeier]. Among their conclusions:
Bubbles emerge at times when investors profoundly dis-
agree about the significance of a big economic develop-
ment, such as the birth of the Internet. Because it’s so much
harder to bet on prices going down than up, the bullish
investors dominate.
Once they get going, financial bubbles are marked by
huge increases in trading, making them easier to identify.
Manias can persist even though many smart people sus-
pect a bubble, because no one of them has the firepower to
successfully attack it. Only when skeptical investors act
simultaneously—a moment impossible to predict—does the
bubble pop.
As a result of all that and more, the Princeton squad argues
that the Fed can and should try to restrain bubbles, rather than
following former Chairman Alan Greenspan’s approach: watch-
ful waiting while prices rise and then cleaning up the mess after
a bubble bursts.
If the tech-stock collapse didn’t make that clear, the
damage done by the housing and credit bubbles should,
argues José Scheinkman, 60 years old, a theorist
Mr. Bernanke recruited in 1999 from the University of
Chicago. “Advanced economies are very dependent on the
health of the financial system. What this bubble did was
destroy the capacity of the financial system to finance the
U.S. economy,” Mr. Scheinkman says.
The Fed is giving the activist approach some thought. In a
speech scheduled for delivery Thursday night, Fed Governor
Frederic Mishkin suggested that while it was inappropriate to
use the blunt instrument of interest-rate increases to prick
bubbles, if too-easy credit appeared to be fueling a mania,
policy makers might craft a regulatory response that could
“help reduce the magnitude of the bubble.”
Yet the very concept of bubbles is at odds with the view
of some that market prices reflect the collective knowl-
edge of multitudes. There are economists who dispute the
existence of bubbles—arguing, for instance, that what
happened to prices in the dot-com boom was a rational
response to the possibility that nascent Internet firms
might turn into Microsofts. But these economists’ num-
bers are thinning.

Housing Prices Since 1952
Figure 30.3 plots the relative price of housing for 1952 I–2010 I. The plotted figure is the
ratio of an index of housing prices to the GDP deflator. When this ratio is rising, it means
that housing prices are rising faster than the overall price level, and vice versa when the ratio
is falling.
The plot in Figure 30.3 is remarkable. Housing prices grew roughly in line with the overall
price level until about 2000. The increase between 2000 and 2006 was then huge, followed by a
huge fall between 2006 and 2009. Between 2000 I and 2006 I the value of housing wealth
increased by about $13 trillion, roughly $500 billion per quarter. Between 2006 II and 2009 I the
fall in the value of housing wealth was about $7 trillion, over $600 billion per quarter. Once again,
it is hard to find a cogent reason for this based on the use value of housing.

Household Wealth Effects on the Economy
We see that both the stock market and the housing market have periods of large unpredictable
ups and downs. How are these swings felt in the real economy? We mentioned in Chapter 23
that one of the factors that affects consumption expenditures is wealth. Other things being
equal, the more wealth a family has, the more it spends. We discuss this in detail in the next
chapter, but all we need to note now is that an increase in wealth increases consumer spend-
ing. Much of the fluctuation in household wealth is due to fluctuations in stock prices and
housing prices. When housing and stock values rise, households feel richer and they spend
more. As a rough rule of thumb, a $1.00 change in the value of wealth (either stocks or hous-
ing) leads to about a $0.03 to $0.04 change in consumer spending. With unpredictable wealth
change, we end up with unpredictable consumption changes and thus unpredictable changes
in GDP.
An increase in stock prices may also increase investment. If a firm is considering an invest-
ment project, one way in which it can finance the project is to issue additional shares of stock.
The higher the price of the firm’s stock, the more money it can get per additional share. A firm is
thus likely to undertake more investment projects the higher its stock price. The cost of an invest-
ment project in terms of shares of stock is smaller the higher the price of the stock. This is the way
a stock market boom may increase investment and a stock market contraction may decrease
investment. Stock price changes affect a firm’s cost of capital.
Financial Crises and the 2008 Bailout
It is clear that the stock market boom in the last half of the 1990s contributed to the strong economy
in that period and that the contraction in the stock market after that contributed to the 2000–2001
recession. It is also clear that the boom in housing prices in the 2000–2005 period contributed to the
expansion that followed the 2000–2001 recession and that the collapse of housing prices between

CHAPTER 30
Financial Crises, Stabilization, and Deficits 605
2006 and 2009 contributed to the 2008–2009 recession. This is just the household wealth effect at
work combined in the case of stock prices with an effect on the investment spending of firms.
The recession of 2008–2009 was also characterized by some observers as a period of financial
crisis. While there is no precise definition of a financial crisis, most financial writers identify
financial crises as periods in which the financial institutions that facilitate the movement of cap-
ital across households and firms cease to work smoothly. In a financial crisis, macroeconomic
problems caused by the wealth effect of a falling stock market or housing market are accentuated.
Many people consider the large fall in housing prices that began at the end of 2006 to have led to
the financial crisis of 2008–2009. We have discussed in Chapter 25 some of the reasons for this fall.
Lax government regulations led to excessive risk taking during the housing boom, with many people
taking out mortgages that could only be sustained if housing prices kept rising. Once housing prices
started to fall, it became clear that many households had taken on too much debt, and the value of
many mortgage-backed securities dropped sharply. Many large financial institutions were involved
in the mortgage market, and they began to experience financial trouble. With the exception of
Lehman Brothers,which went bankrupt,most of the large financial institutions were bailed out by the
federal government—a $700 billion bailout bill that was passed in October 2008. These institutions
included Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, and A.I.G. The government
provided capital to these firms to ease their financial difficulties. The Federal Reserve also participated
in the bailout, buying huge amounts of mortgage-backed securities. We saw in Chapter 25 that in
2010, the Fed held about $1.3 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, which it purchased in 2008 and
2009.Many other countries had similar issues,in part because many of the large financial institutions
in other countries had purchased U.S. mortgage-backed securities.
What would have happened had the U.S. government not bailed out the large financial insti-
tutions? This is a matter of debate among economists and politicians. But some effects are clear.
Absent intervention, the negative wealth effect would have been larger. Some of the financial
institutions would have gone bankrupt, which would have wiped out their bondholders. Many of
these bonds are held by the household sector, so household wealth would have fallen from the
loss in value of the bonds. The fall in overall stock prices would also likely have been larger, thus
contributing to the negative wealth effect. The government bailout thus reduced the fall in wealth
that took place during this period. Some people also argue that lending to businesses would have
been lower had there been no bailout. This would have forced businesses to cut investment,
thereby contributing to the contraction in aggregate demand. It is not clear how important this
effect is since, as seen in Chapter 25, much of the Fed’s purchase of mortgage-backed securities
ended up as excess reserves in banks, not as increased loans.
It is important to distinguish between the stimulus measures the government took to fight the
2008–2009 recession, which were tax cuts and spending increases, and the bailout activity, which
was direct help to financial institutions to keep them from failing. Putting aside the stimulus mea-
sures, was the bailout a good idea? On the positive side, it lessened the negative wealth effect and
possibly led to more loans to businesses. Also, much of the lending to the financial institutions has
or will be repaid; so the final total cost will be less than $700 billion. On the negative side, there
were political and social costs. Most of the people who benefited from the bailout were wealthy—
certainly wealthier than average. The wealth that didn’t fall because of the bailout was mostly
wealth of high-income people—people holding the bonds of the financial institutions. Also, the
jobs in the financial institutions that were saved were mostly jobs of high-income earners. People
who will pay for the bailout in the long run are the U.S. taxpayers, who are on average less wealthy
than those who benefited from the bailout. The bailout thus likely had, or at least was perceived by
many to have had, bad income distribution consequences, which put a strain on the body politic.
Even though much of the money will be repaid, not all of it will, and the perception lingers that the
rich were bailed out. We come back to this in the third section of this chapter, but the bailout will
probably make it harder to increase tax rates on middle-income people in the future.
Asset Markets and Policy Makers
It should be clear by now that stock prices and housing prices have played a large role in the econ-
omy since the 1990s. The problem for policy makers trying to stabilize the economy is that it is
hard to predict changes in stock and housing prices. Who could have predicted ahead of time the
boom in the stock market that began in 1995, or the boom in housing prices that began in 2000,
or the collapse of housing prices that began in 2006? Changes in asset prices like these are essentially

In July 2010 in the aftermath of the financial crisis and subse-

unpredictable, so policy makers can only react after the fact to such changes. Their ability to sta-
bilize the economy is thus considerably restricted by the fact that changes in asset prices affect the
economy and are not predictable. One exception, however, that is often cited is that perhaps the
U.S. government (including the Fed) should have seen in the 2002–2005 period the excessive risk
that was being taken and instituted added government regulation. The Economics in Practice
above describes the financial regulation bill that was passed in 2010 to try to tighten up financial
regulations in the hope of preventing a recurrence of the 2008–2009 financial crisis.
Time Lags Regarding Monetary and 
Fiscal Policy
We have so far seen that asset-price changes are difficult for policy makers to deal with because
they can’t be predicted ahead of time.At best, policy makers deal with these changes only after they
occur. Even once problems are recognized, however, responding to these problems takes time.
Consider the two possible time paths for aggregate output (income) (Y) shown in Figure 30.4. In
path B (the light blue line), the fluctuations in GDP are smaller than those in path A (the dark blue
line). One aim of stabilization policy is to smooth out fluctuations in output to try to move the
Congress Passes Financial Reform Bill
The Washington Post
Congress gave final approval Thursday to the most ambitious
overhaul of financial regulation in generations, ending more
than a year of wrangling over the shape of the new rules and
shifting the government’s focus to the monumental task of
implementing them.
The final Senate vote, which came almost two years after
the nation’s financial system nearly collapsed, was a significant
legislative victory for President Obama, who had pledged to
rein in the reckless Wall Street behavior behind the crisis and to
right the government regulation that failed to prevent it.
The massive bill establishes an independent consumer
bureau within the Federal Reserve to protect borrowers
against abuses in mortgage, credit card and some other
types of lending. The legislation also gives the government
new power to seize and shut down large, troubled financial
companies—like the failed investment bank Lehman
Brothers—and sets up a council of federal regulators to
watch for threats to the financial system.
Under the new rules, the vast market for derivatives, com-
plex financial instruments that helped fuel the crisis, will be
subject to government oversight. Shareholders, meanwhile,
will gain more say on how corporate executives are paid. 
Obama, who is scheduled to sign the legislation next
week, said Thursday that the bill will "protect consumers and
lay the foundation for a stronger and safer financial system,
one that is innovative, creative, competitive, and far less
prone to panic and collapse." 
The legislation places much faith—and much authority—
in regulators to spot brewing problems in the financial system
and to prevent another crisis.

economy along a path like B instead of A. Stabilization policy is also concerned with the stability of
prices. Here the goal is not to prevent the overall price level from rising at all, but instead to achieve
an inflation rate that is as close as possible to a target rate of about 2 percent given the govern-
ment’s other goals of high and stable levels of output and employment.
Stabilization goals are not easy to achieve. The existence of various kinds of time lags, or
delays in the response of the economy to stabilization policies, can make the economy difficult to
control. Economists generally recognize three kinds of time lags: recognition lags, implementa-
tion lags, and response lags.
Stabilization
Figure 30.5 shows timing problems a government may face when trying to stabilize the economy.
Suppose the economy reaches a peak and begins to slide into recession at point A (at time t0).
Policy makers do not observe the decline in GDP until it has sunk to point B (at time t1). By the
time they have begun to stimulate the economy (point C, time t2), the recession is well advanced
and the economy has almost bottomed out. When the policies finally begin to take effect (point
D, time t3), the economy is already on its road to recovery. The policies push the economy to
point E —a much greater fluctuation than point E, which is where the economy would have been
without the stabilization policy. Sometime after point D, policy makers may begin to realize that
the economy is expanding too quickly. By the time they have implemented contractionary poli-
cies and the policies have made their effects felt, the economy is starting to weaken. The contrac-
tionary policies therefore end up pushing GDP to point F instead of point F.
Because of the various time lags, the expansionary policies that should have been instituted
at time t0 do not begin to have an effect until time t3, when they are no longer needed. The light
blue line in Figure 30.5 shows how the economy behaves as a result of the “stabilization” policies.
The dark blue line shows the time path of GDP if the economy had been allowed to run its course
and no stabilization policies had been attempted. In this case, stabilization policy makes income

more erratic, not less—the policy results in a peak income of E as opposed to E and a trough
income of F instead of F.
Critics of stabilization policy argue that the situation in Figure 30.5 is typical of the interac-
tion between the government and the rest of the economy. This claim is not necessarily true. We
need to know more about the nature of the various kinds of lags before deciding whether stabi-
lization policy is good or bad.
Recognition Lags
It takes time for policy makers to recognize a boom or a slump. Many important data—those
from the national income and product accounts, for example—are available only quarterly. It
usually takes several weeks to compile and prepare even the preliminary estimates for these fig-
ures. If the economy goes into a slump on January 1, the recession may not be detected until the
data for the first quarter are available at the end of April.
Moreover, the early national income and product accounts data are only preliminary, based
on an incomplete compilation of the various data sources. These estimates can, and often do,
change as better data become available. This situation makes the interpretation of the initial esti-
mates difficult, and recognition lags result.
Implementation Lags
The problems that lags pose for stabilization policy do not end once economists and policy mak-
ers recognize that the economy is in a boom or a slump. Even if everyone knows that the economy
needs to be stimulated or reined in, it takes time to put the desired policy into effect, especially for
actions that involve fiscal policy. Implementation lags result.
Each year Congress decides on the federal government’s budget for the coming year. The tax
laws and spending programs embodied in this budget are hard to change once they are in place.
If it becomes clear that the economy is entering a recession and is in need of a fiscal stimulus dur-
ing the middle of the year, there is a limited amount that can be done. Until Congress authorizes
more spending or a cut in taxes, changes in fiscal policy are not possible.1
Monetary policy is less subject to the kinds of restrictions that slow down changes in fiscal
policy. As we saw in Chapter 25, the Fed’s main tool for controlling the supply of money or the
interest rate is open market operations—buying and selling government securities. Transactions
in these securities take place in a highly developed market, and if the Fed chooses, it can buy or
sell a large volume of securities in a very short period of time. The implementation lag for mon-
etary policy is generally much shorter than for fiscal policy. When the Fed wants to increase the
supply of money, it goes into the open market and purchases government securities. This action
instantly increases the stock of money (bank reserves held at the Fed), and an expansion of the
money supply begins.
Response Lags
Even after a macroeconomic problem has been recognized and the appropriate policies to correct
it have been implemented, there are response lags—lags that occur because of the operation of
the economy itself. Even after the government has formulated a policy and put it into place, the
economy takes time to adjust to the new conditions. Although monetary policy can be adjusted
and implemented more quickly than fiscal policy, it takes longer to make its effect felt on the
economy because of response lags. What is most important is the total lag between the time a
problem first occurs and the time the corrective policies are felt.
Response Lags for Fiscal Policy
One way to think about the response lag in fiscal pol-
icy is through the government spending multiplier. This multiplier measures the change in GDP
caused by a given change in government spending or net taxes. It takes time for the multiplier to

1 Do not forget, however, about the existence of automatic stabilizers (Chapter 24). Many programs contain built-in counter-
cyclical features that expand spending or cut tax collections automatically (without the need for congressional or executive
action) during a recession.

implemented; the lag that
occurs because of the operation
of the economy itself.

CHAPTER 30
Financial Crises, Stabilization, and Deficits 609
reach its full value. The result is a lag between the time a fiscal policy action is initiated and the
time the full change in GDP is realized.
The reason for the response lag in fiscal policy—the delay in the multiplier process—is sim-
ple. During the first few months after an increase in government spending or a tax cut, there is
not enough time for the firms or individuals who benefit directly from the extra government
spending or the tax cut to increase their own spending. Neither individuals nor firms revise their
spending plans instantaneously. Until they can make those revisions, extra government spending
does not stimulate extra private spending.
Changes in government purchases are a component of aggregate expenditure. When G rises,
aggregate expenditure increases directly; when G falls, aggregate expenditure decreases directly.
When personal taxes are changed, however, an additional step intervenes, giving rise to another
lag. Suppose a tax cut has lowered personal income taxes across the board. Each household must
decide what portion of its tax cut to spend and what portion to save. This decision is the extra
step. Before the tax cut gets translated into extra spending, households must take the step of
increasing their spending, which usually takes some time.
With a business tax cut, there is a further complication. Firms must decide what to do
with their added after-tax profits. If they pay out their added profits to households as divi-
dends, the result is the same as with a personal tax cut. Households must decide whether to
spend or to save the extra funds. Firms may also retain their added profits and use them for
investment, but investment is a component of aggregate expenditure that requires planning
and time.
In practice, it takes about a year for a change in taxes or in government spending to have its
full effect on the economy. This response lag means that if we increase spending to counteract a
recession today, the full effects will not be felt for 12 months. By that time, the state of the econ-
omy might be very different.
Response Lags for Monetary Policy
Monetary policy works by changing interest rates,
which then change planned investment. Interest rates can also affect consumption spending, as
we discuss further in Chapter 31. For now, it is enough to know that lower interest rates usually
stimulate consumption spending and that higher interest rates decrease consumption spending.
The response of consumption and investment to interest rate changes takes time. Even if
interest rates were to drop by 5 percent overnight, firms would not immediately increase
their investment purchases. Firms generally make their investment plans several years in
advance. If General Motors (GM) wants to respond to a decrease in interest rates by invest-
ing more, it will take time—perhaps up to a year—for the firm to come up with plans for a
new factory or assembly line. While drawing up such plans, GM may spend little on new
investments. The effect of the decrease in interest rates may not make itself felt for quite
some time.
The response lags for monetary policy are even longer than response lags for fiscal pol-
icy. When government spending changes, there is a direct change in the sales of firms, which
sell more as a result of the increased government purchases. When interest rates change,
however, the sales of firms do not change until households change their consumption spend-
ing and/or firms change their investment spending. It takes time for households and firms to
respond to interest rate changes. In this sense, interest rate changes are like tax-rate changes.
The resulting change in firms’ sales must wait for households and firms to change their pur-
chases of goods.
Summary
Stabilization is thus not easily achieved even if there are no surprise asset-price changes. It
takes time for policy makers to recognize the existence of a problem, more time for them to
implement a solution, and yet more time for firms and households to respond to the stabiliza-
tion policies taken. Monetary policy can be adjusted more quickly and easily than taxes or
government spending, making it a useful instrument in stabilizing the economy. However,
because the economy’s response to monetary changes is probably slower than its response
to changes in fiscal policy, tax and spending changes may also play a useful role in macro-
economic management.

Further Macroeconomics Issues 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
Act
Passed by the U.S.
Congress and signed by
President Reagan in 1986, this
law set out to reduce the
federal deficit by $36 billion
per year, with a deficit of zero
slated for 1991.
Government Deficit Issues
If a government is trying to stimulate the economy through tax cuts or spending increases,
this, other things being equal, will increase the government deficit. One thus expects deficits
in recessions—cyclical deficits. These deficits are temporary and do not impose any long-run
problems, especially if modest surpluses are run when there is full employment. If, however, at
full employment the deficit—the structural deficit—is still large, this can have negative long-
run consequences.
We saw in Table 24.5, p. 488, that the U.S. government deficit in 2009 was $1.2 trillion. It was
clear in 2010 that the United States was facing a huge structural deficit problem. Figure 24.5, p. 490,
shows how this problem developed. At the beginning of 2001, the government was running a sur-
plus, and by the end of the year, it was in deficit. Most of this was a cyclical deficit because the econ-
omy was in a recession. Deficits persisted after the recession, however, and in the roughly full
employment years of 2005–2007, the deficit was between about 1.5 and 2.0 percent of GDP. These
deficits were all full employment deficits since the economy was at full employment. The recession
hit in 2008 and the deficits soared. The deficit as a percent of GDP reached 9.5 percent in 2009 III,
and in 2010, when the economy was beginning to recover from the recession, the percent was still
about 9 percent. Although some of the deficit was still cyclical, much was structural.
The large deficits from 2008 on led to a large rise in the ratio of the federal government debt
to GDP. In 2010 I the ratio was about 46 percent, up from about 36 percent at the end of 2007.
Government projections suggested that the ratio of the federal government debt to GDP could be
over 70 percent by 2020. Many talked about the need to raise taxes or cut spending, but there
seemed little political will to do so. One problem, discussed at the end of the first section, is that
many middle-income taxpayers were angry about the bailout and did not want what they per-
ceived were tax increases to pay for bailing out the rich. At the time of this writing (summer of
2010), there was no long-run plan to deal with the U.S. structural deficit.
What happens if a country like the United States continues to run large structural deficits year
after year? Deficits require that the government borrow money to finance them. In the case of the
United States, the U.S. Treasury must sell bills and bonds. If the Fed buys them, this increases the
money supply, which means that the government is simply financing the deficit by printing money.
This is not a viable long-run strategy. It will eventually lead to excess aggregate demand and hyperin-
flation. If the Treasury is forced to sell the bonds to the U.S. public and foreigners, this may drive
down the price of bonds and thus drive up the interest rate on the bonds. High interest rates, other
things being equal, increase the government deficit because of higher government interest payments.
The government has to hope that the public and foreigners are willing to buy the bonds with only
modest decreases in their prices.This can continue for a long time.In 2010 the U.S.Treasury was able
to sell large quantities of government bonds with negligible effects on bond prices. The public and
foreigners were gobbling them up. Some economists are concerned that this demand may dry up.
One long-run concern from continuing deficits is that interest rates are driven up, thus
exacerbating the deficit problem. Another concern is the possibility of a negative reaction from
the stock market. If the market perceives that at some point interest rates will rise and that
because of this the government will be forced to raise taxes or cut spending, this decreases
expected future dividends, which drives down stock prices. So there could be a negative wealth
effect even before bond rates begin to rise if the stock market expects this to happen. In short,
possible negative asset-market reactions may discipline the long-run deficit strategy of the
government. The asset markets may force the government to get its budget in control. This is
another constraint on the ability of policy makers to stabilize the economy. If there is a struc-
tural deficit problem, policy makers may not have the freedom to lower taxes or raise spending
to mitigate a downturn.
Deficit Targeting
The year 2010 was not the first time in which deficit issues played a major role in policy discus-
sions. In the 1980s the U.S. government was spending much more than it was receiving in taxes.
In response to the large deficits, in 1986 the U.S. Congress passed and President Reagan signed
the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act (named for its three congressional sponsors), referred to as
GRH. It is interesting to look back on this in the context of the current deficit problem. GRH set

CHAPTER 30
Financial Crises, Stabilization, and Deficits 611
a target for reducing the federal deficit by a set amount each year. As Figure 30.6 shows, the
deficit was to decline by $36 billion per year between 1987 and 1991, with a deficit of zero slated
for fiscal year 1991. What was interesting about the GRH legislation was that the targets were
not merely guidelines. If Congress, through its decisions about taxes and spending programs,
produced a budget with a deficit larger than the targeted amount, GRH called for automatic
spending cuts. The cuts were divided proportionately among most federal spending programs
so that a program that made up 5 percent of total spending was to endure a cut equal to 5 per-
cent of the total spending cut.2
In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court declared part of the GRH bill unconstitutional. In effect, the
Court said that Congress would have to approve the “automatic”spending cuts before they could take
place. The law was changed in 1986 to meet the Supreme Court ruling and again in 1987, when new
targets were established.The new targets had the deficit reaching zero in 1993 instead of 1991.The tar-
gets were revised again in 1991,when the year to achieve a zero deficit was changed from 1993 to 1996.
In practice, these targets never came close to being achieved. As time wore on, even the revised
targets became completely unrealistic, and by the end of the 1980s, the GRH legislation was not
taken seriously.
Although the GRH legislation is history, it is useful to consider the stabilization conse-
quences of deficit targeting. What if deficit targeting is taken seriously? Is this good policy?
The answer is probably not. We will now show how deficit targeting can make the economy
more unstable.
In a world with no deficit targeting, the Congress and the president make decisions each year
about how much to spend and how much to tax. The federal government deficit is a result of
these decisions and the state of the economy. However, with deficit targeting, the size of the
deficit is set in advance. Taxes and government spending must be adjusted to produce the
required deficit. In this situation, the deficit is no longer a consequence of the tax and spending
decisions. Instead, taxes and spending become a consequence of the deficit decision.
What difference does it make whether Congress chooses a target deficit and adjusts govern-
ment spending and taxes to achieve that target or decides how much to spend and tax and lets the
deficit adjust itself? The difference may be substantial. Consider a leftward shift of the AD curve
caused by some negative demand shock. A negative demand shock is something that causes a
negative shift in consumption or investment schedules or that leads to a decrease in U.S. exports.
We know that a leftward shift of the AD curve lowers aggregate output (income), which causes
the government deficit to increase. In a world without deficit targeting, the increase in the deficit
during contractions provides an automatic stabilizer for the economy. (Review Chapter 24 if this
point is hazy.) The contraction-induced decrease in tax revenues and increase in transfer payments
tend to reduce the fall in after-tax income and consumer spending due to the negative demand
shock. Thus, the decrease in aggregate output (income) caused by the negative demand shock is
lessened somewhat by the growth of the deficit [Figure 30.7(a)].
In a world with deficit targeting, the deficit is not allowed to rise. Some combination of tax
increases and government spending cuts would be needed to offset what would have otherwise
been an increase in the deficit. We know that increases in taxes or cuts in spending are contrac-
tionary in themselves. The contraction in the economy will therefore be larger than it would have
been without deficit targeting because the initial effect of the negative demand shock is worsened
2 Programs such as Social Security were exempt from cuts or were treated differently. Interest payments on the federal debt were
also immune from cuts.

by the rise in taxes or the cut in government spending required to keep the deficit from rising. As
Figure 30.7(b) shows, deficit targeting acts as an automatic destabilizer. It requires taxes to be
raised and government spending to be cut during a contraction. This reinforces, rather than
counteracts, the shock that started the contraction.
Deficit targeting thus has undesirable macroeconomic consequences. It requires cuts in
spending or increases in taxes at times when the economy is already experiencing problems. This
drawback does not mean, of course, that a government should ignore structural deficit problems.
But locking in spending cuts or tax increases during periods of negative demand shocks is not a
good way to manage the economy. Moving forward, policy makers around the globe will have to
devise other methods to control growing structural deficits.

THE STOCK MARKET, THE HOUSING MARKET, AND
FINANCIAL CRISES p. 600
1. A firm can finance an investment project by borrowing from
banks, by issuing bonds, or by issuing new shares of its stock.
People who own shares of stock own a fraction of the firm.
2. The price of a stock should equal the discounted value of its
expected future dividends, where the discount factors
depend on the interest rate and risk.
3. A bubble exists when the price of a stock exceeds the dis-
counted value of its expected future dividends. In this case
what matters is what people expect that other people expect
about how much the stock can be sold for in the future.
4. The largest stock market boom in U.S. history occurred
between 1995 and 2000, when the S&P 500 index rose by
25 percent per year. The boom added $14 trillion to house-
hold wealth.
5. Why there was a stock market boom in 1995–2000 appears
to be a puzzle. There was nothing unusual about earnings
that would predict such a boom. Many people believe that
the boom was merely a bubble.
6. Housing prices rose rapidly between 2000 and 2006 and fell
rapidly between 2006 and 2009. Many consider that the fall
in housing prices beginning in 2006 led to the recession and
financial crisis of 2008–2009.
7. Changes in stock prices and housing prices change house-
hold wealth, which affects consumption and thus the real
economy. Changes in stock and housing prices are largely
unpredictable, which makes many fluctuations in the econ-
omy unpredictable.
TIME LAGS REGARDING MONETARY AND FISCAL
POLICY p. 606
8. Stabilization policy describes both fiscal and monetary pol-
icy, the goals of which are to smooth out fluctuations in out-
put and employment and to keep prices as stable as possible.
Stabilization goals are not necessarily easy to achieve because
of the existence of certain time lags, or delays in the response
of the economy to macroeconomic policies.

9. A recognition lag is the time it takes for policy makers to
recognize the existence of a boom or a slump. An
implementation lag is the time it takes to put the desired
policy into effect once economists and policy makers
recognize that the economy is in a boom or a slump.
A response lag is the time it takes for the economy
to adjust to the new conditions after a new policy is
implemented—in other words, a lag that occurs because
of the operation of the economy itself. In general, mone-
tary policy can be implemented more rapidly than fiscal
policy but fiscal policy generally has a shorter response
lag than monetary policy.
GOVERNMENT DEFICIT ISSUES p. 610
10. The U.S. government was running a large structural deficit
in 2010. There was much debate about what to do, but no
agreed-upon long-run plan. Large deficits year after year
may lead to negative asset-market reactions, such as large
decreases in bond and stock prices.
11. In 1986 Congress passed and President Reagan signed the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act (GRH), which set deficit tar-
gets for each year. The aim was to reduce the large structural
deficit that existed.
12. Deficit-targeting measures that call for automatic spending
cuts to eliminate or reduce the deficit, like the GRH legisla-
tion, may have the effect of destabilizing the economy.

4. You are given the following information about the economy in
2010 (all in billions of dollars):
Consumption function:
C = 100 + (.8  Yd)
Taxes:
T = -150 + (.25  Y)
Investment function:
I = 60
Disposable income:
Yd = Y - T
Government spending:
G = 80
Equilibrium:
Y = C + I + G
Hint: Deficit is D = G - T = G - [-150 + (.25  Y)].
a. Find equilibrium income. Show that the government budget
deficit (the difference between government spending and tax
revenues) is $5 billion.
b. Congress passes the Foghorn-Leghorn (F-L) amendment,
which requires that the deficit be zero this year. If the budget
adopted by Congress has a deficit that is larger than zero, the
deficit target must be met by cutting spending. Suppose
spending is cut by $5 billion (to $75 billion). What is the new
value for equilibrium GDP? What is the new deficit? Explain
carefully why the deficit is not zero.
c. Suppose the F-L amendment was not in effect and planned
investment falls to I = 55. What is the new value of GDP?
What is the new government budget deficit? What happens
to GDP if the F-L amendment is in effect and spending is cut
to reach the deficit target? (Hint: Spending must be cut by
$21.666 billion to balance the budget.)
1. In July 2003, the S&P 500 index was at 1,000.
a. What is the S&P 500 index?
b. Where is the S&P today?
c. If you had invested $10,000 in July 2003 and your invest-
ments had increased in value by the same percentage as
the S&P 500 index had increased, how much would you
have today?
d. Assume that the total stock market holdings of the house-
hold sector were about $12 trillion and that the entire stock
market went up/down by the same percentage as the S&P.
Evidence suggests that the “wealth effect” of stock market
holdings on consumer spending is about 4 percent of wealth
annually. How much additional or reduced spending would
you expect to see as a result of the stock market moves since
July 2003? Assuming a multiplier of 2 and a GDP of
$10,000 billion, how much additional/less GDP would 
you predict for next year if all of this was true?
2. During 1997, stock markets in Asia collapsed. Hong Kong’s was
down nearly 30 percent, Thailand’s was down 62 percent, and
Malaysia’s was down 60 percent. Japan and Korea experienced
big drops as well. What impacts would these events have on the
economies of the countries themselves? Explain your answer. In
what ways would you have expected these events to influence
the U.S. economy? How might the spending of Asians on
American goods be affected? What about Americans who have
invested in these countries?
3. Explain why the government deficit rises as the economy contracts.

5. Some states are required to balance their budgets. Is this mea-
sure stabilizing or destabilizing? Suppose all states were commit-
ted to a balanced-budget philosophy and the economy moved
into a recession. What effects would this philosophy have on the
size of the federal deficit?
6. Explain why stabilization policy may be difficult to carry out. How
is it possible that stabilization policies can actually be destabilizing?
7. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 603] The housing
boom of 2000–2005 created wealth of over $10 trillion. Many
claim that the spending of this new wealth prevented a serious
recession in the early 2000s. If people spent 4% of that new hous-
ing wealth annually by taking out home equity loans or simply
saving less, what would be the increase in annual consumption
expenditures? (Be careful in counting decimal places.) What
would happen to GDP growth as a result?
8. Suppose the government decides to decrease spending and
increase taxes in an attempt to decrease its deficit. Is it possible
for the Fed to ease the macroeconomic effects of the spending
and tax changes? Explain.
9. If the government implements a spending and tax policy in
which it promises to neither increase nor decrease spending and
taxes, is it still possible for the budget deficit to increase or
decrease? Explain.
10. Explain why the implementation lag is generally longer and the
response lag is generally shorter for fiscal policy than they are
for monetary policy.
11. In August 2010, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued
a report estimating that the federal budget deficit for 2010
would exceed $1.3 trillion, or 9.1 percent of GDP. Working
under the assumption that current laws affecting the budget
will not change (i.e., no revisions in planned tax changes or fis-
cal stimulus spending), the CBO also estimated that the deficit
as a percentage of GDP would fall to 4.2 percent by 2012. Go to
www.cbo.gov and look up the current and estimated deficit-to-
GDP ratios. Were the CBO’s estimates accurate, and have its
projections changed? Explain whether any policy changes
enacted since August 2010 might have been responsible for
changes in the CBO’s projections.

In Chapters 23 through 29, we
considered the interactions of
households, firms, and the govern-
ment in the goods, money, and
labor markets. The macroecon-
omy is complicated, and there is
much to learn about these interac-
tions. To keep our discussions as
uncomplicated as possible, we
assumed simple behavior of
households and firms—the two
basic decision-making units in the
economy. We assumed that house-
hold consumption (C) depends
only on income and that firms’ planned investment (I) depends only on the interest rate. We did
not consider that households make consumption and labor supply decisions simultaneously and
that firms make investment and employment decisions simultaneously.
Now that we understand the basic interactions in the economy, we present a more realistic
picture of the influences on households’ consumption and labor supply decisions and on firms’
investment and employment decisions. We then use what we have learned to analyze more
macroeconomic issues.
Households: Consumption and Labor
Supply Decisions
For most of our analysis so far,we have been assuming that consumption depends simply on income.
While this is a useful starting point,it is far from a complete description of the consumption decision
of households. We need to consider other theories of consumption to build a more realistic case.
The Life-Cycle Theory of Consumption
Most people make consumption decisions based not only on current income but also on what
they expect to earn later in life. Many of you, as young college students, are consuming more than
you currently earn as you anticipate future earnings, while a number of your instructors are con-
suming less than they currently earn as they save for retirement without earnings. The model of
consumption that is based on the idea that people track lifetime income when they make con-
sumption decisions is called the life-cycle theory of consumption.

 FIGURE 31.1
Life-Cycle Theory of
Consumption
In their early working years, peo-
ple consume more than they
earn. This is also true in the
retirement years. In between,
people save (consume less than
they earn) to pay off debts from
borrowing and to accumulate
savings for retirement.
The lifetime income and consumption pattern of a representative individual is shown in
Figure 31.1. As you can see, this person has a low income during the first part of her life, high
income in the middle, and low income again in retirement. Her income in retirement is not zero
because she has income from sources other than her own labor—Social Security payments, inter-
est and dividends, and so on.
The consumption path as drawn in Figure 31.1 is constant over the person’s life. This is an
extreme assumption, but it illustrates the point that the path of consumption over a lifetime is
likely to be more stable than the path of income. We consume an amount greater than our
incomes during our early working careers. We do so by borrowing against future income by tak-
ing out a car loan, a mortgage to buy a house, or a loan to pay for college. This debt is repaid when
our incomes have risen and we can afford to use some of our income to pay off past borrowing
without substantially lowering our consumption. The reverse is true for our retirement years.
Here, too, our incomes are low. Because we consume less than we earn during our prime working
years, we can save up a “nest egg” that allows us to maintain an acceptable standard of living dur-
ing retirement.
Fluctuations in wealth are also an important component of the life-cycle story. Many
young households borrow in anticipation of higher income in the future. Some households
actually have negative wealth—the value of their assets is less than the debts they owe. A house-
hold in its prime working years saves to pay off debts and to build up assets for its later years,
when income typically goes down. Households whose assets are greater than the debts they
owe have positive wealth. With its wage earners retired, a household consumes its accumulated
wealth. Generally speaking, wealth starts out negative, turns positive, and then approaches zero
near the end of life. Wealth, therefore, is intimately linked to the cumulative saving and dissav-
ing behavior of households.
The key difference between the Keynesian theory of consumption and the life-cycle the-
ory is that the life-cycle theory suggests that consumption and saving decisions are likely to
be based not only on current income but also on expectations of future income. The con-
sumption behavior of households immediately following World War II clearly supports the
life-cycle story. Just after the war ended, income fell as wage earners moved out of war-
related work. However, consumption spending did not fall commensurately, as Keynesian
theory would predict. People expected to find jobs in other sectors eventually, and they did
not adjust their consumption spending to the temporarily lower incomes they were earning
in the meantime.
The term permanent income is sometimes used to refer to the average level of a person’s
expected future income stream. If you expect your income will be high in the future (even though
it may not be high now), your permanent income is said to be high. With this concept, we can
sum up the life-cycle theory by saying that current consumption decisions are likely to be based

income.

CHAPTER 31

on permanent income instead of current income.1 This means that policy changes such as tax-
rate changes are likely to have more of an effect on household behavior if they are expected to be
permanent instead of temporary.
One-time tax rebates such as we saw in the United States in 2001 and 2008 provide an
interesting test of the permanent income hypothesis. In both cases, the tax rebate was a one-
time stimulus. In 2008, for example, the tax rebate was $300 to $600 for individual tax payers
eligible for the rebate. How much would we expect this rebate to influence consumption?
The simple Keynesian model that we introduced earlier in this text would just apply the mar-
ginal propensity to consume to the $600. If the marginal propensity to consume is .8, we
would expect the $600 to generate $480 in incremental spending per rebate. The permanent
income hypothesis instead looks at the $600 in the context of an individual’s permanent
income. As a fraction of one’s lifetime income, $600 is a modest number, and we would thus
expect individuals to increase their spending only modestly in response to the rebate.
Research on the 2001 tax rebate by Matthew Shapiro and Joel Slemrod, based on surveys of
consumers, suggested that most people planned to use their rebates to lower debt, rather
than increase spending.
Although the life-cycle model enriches our understanding of the consumption behavior of
households, the analysis is still missing something. What is missing is the other main decision of
households: the labor supply decision.
The Labor Supply Decision
The size of the labor force in an economy is of obvious importance. A growing labor force is one
of the ways in which national income/output can be expanded, and the larger the percentage of
people who work, the higher the potential output per capita.
So far we have said little about what determines the size of the labor force. Of course, demo-
graphics are a key; the number of children born in 2010 will go a long way toward determining
the potential number of 20-year-old workers in 2030. In addition, immigration, both legal and
illegal, plays a role.
Behavior also plays a role. Households make decisions about whether to work and how
much to work. These decisions are closely tied to consumption decisions because for most house-
holds, the bulk of their spending is financed out of wages and salaries. Households make con-
sumption and labor supply decisions simultaneously. Consumption cannot be considered
separately from labor supply because it is precisely by selling your labor that you earn income to
pay for your consumption.
As we discussed in Chapter 3, the alternative to supplying your labor in exchange for a wage
or a salary is leisure or other nonmarket activities. Nonmarket activities include raising a child,
going to school, keeping a house, or—in a developing economy—working as a subsistence farmer.
What determines the quantity of labor supplied by a household? Among the list of factors are the
wage rate, prices, wealth, and nonlabor income.
The Wage Rate
A changing wage rate can affect labor supply, but whether the effect is pos-
itive or negative is ambiguous. An increase in the wage rate affects a household in two ways.
First, work becomes more attractive relative to leisure and other nonmarket activities. Because
every hour spent in leisure now requires giving up a higher wage, the opportunity cost of leisure
is higher. As a result, you would expect that a higher wage would lead to a larger quantity of
labor supplied—a larger workforce. This is called the substitution effect of a wage rate increase.
On the other hand, household members who work are clearly better off after a wage rate
increase. By working the same number of hours as they did before, they will earn more income. If
we assume that leisure is a normal good, people with higher income will spend some of it on
leisure by working less. This is the income effect of a wage rate increase.
1 The pioneering work on this topic was done by Milton Friedman, A Theory of the Consumption Function (Princeton, NJ:
Princeton University Press, 1957). In the mid-1960s, Franco Modigliani did closely related work that included the formulation
of the life-cycle theory.

618
PART VI
Further Macroeconomics Issues 
When wage rates rise, the substitution effect suggests that people will work more, while the
income effect suggests that they will work less. The ultimate effect depends on which separate
effect is more powerful. The data suggest that the substitution effect seems to win in most cases.
That is, higher wage rates usually lead to a larger labor supply and lower wage rates usually lead to
a lower labor supply.
Prices
Prices also play a major role in the consumption/labor supply decision. In our discus-
sions of the possible effects of an increase in the wage rate, we have been assuming that the prices
of goods and services do not rise at the same time. If the wage rate and all other prices rise simul-
taneously, the story is different. To make things clear, we need to distinguish between the nominal
wage rate and the real wage rate.
The nominal wage rate is the wage rate in current dollars. When we adjust the nominal
wage rate for changes in the price level, we obtain the real wage rate. The real wage rate
measures the amount that wages can buy in terms of goods and services. Workers do not care
about their nominal wage—they care about the purchasing power of this wage—the 
real wage.
Suppose skilled workers in Indianapolis were paid a wage rate of $20 per hour in 2010.
Now suppose their wage rate rose to $22 in 2011, a 10 percent increase. If the prices of goods
and services were the same in 2011 as they were in 2010, the real wage rate would have
increased by 10 percent. An hour of work in 2011 ($22) buys 10 percent more than an hour
of work in 2010 ($20). What if the prices of all goods and services also increased by 10 percent
between 2010 and 2011? The purchasing power of an hour’s wages has not changed. The real wage
rate has not increased at all. In 2011, $22 bought the same quantity of goods and services that $20
bought in 2010.
To measure the real wage rate, we adjust the nominal wage rate with a price index. As we saw
in Chapter 22, there are several such indexes that we might use, including the consumer price
index and the GDP price index.2
We can now apply what we have learned from the life-cycle theory to our wage/price story.
Recall that the life-cycle theory says that people look ahead in making their decisions. Translated
to real wage rates, this idea says that households look at expected future real wage rates as well as
the current real wage rate in making their current consumption and labor supply decisions.
Consider, for example, medical students who expect that their real wage rate will be higher in the
future. This expectation obviously has an effect on current decisions about things like how much
to buy and whether to take a part-time job.
Wealth and Nonlabor Income
Life-cycle theory implies that wealth fluctuates over the
life cycle. Households accumulate wealth during their working years to pay off debts accumulated
when they were young and to support themselves in retirement. This role of wealth is clear, but
the existence of wealth poses another question. Consider two households that are at the same
stage in their life cycle and have similar expectations about future wage rates, prices, and so on.
They expect to live the same length of time, and both plan to leave the same amount to their chil-
dren. They differ only in their wealth. Because of a past inheritance, household 1 has more wealth
than household 2. Which household is likely to have a higher consumption path for the rest of its
life? Household 1 is because it has more wealth to spread out over the rest of its life. Holding
everything else constant (including the stage in the life cycle), the more wealth a household has,
the more it will consume both now and in the future.
Now consider a household that has a sudden unexpected increase in wealth, perhaps an
inheritance from a distant relative. How will the household’s consumption pattern be
affected? Few spend the entire inheritance all at once. Most households will increase con-
sumption both now and in the future, spending the inheritance over the course of the rest of
their lives.
nominal wage rate
The wage
rate in current dollars.
real wage rate
The amount
the nominal wage rate can buy
in terms of goods and services.
2 To calculate the real wage rate, we divide the nominal wage rate by the price index. Suppose the wage rate rose from $10 per
hour in 1998 to $18 per hour in 2010 and the price level rose 50 percent during the same period. Using 1998 as the base year, the
price index would be 1.00 in 1998 and 1.50 in 2010. The real wage rate is W/P, where W is the nominal wage rate and P is the
price level. Using 1998 as the base year, the real wage rate is $10 in 1998 ($10.00/1.00) and $12 in 2010 ($18.00/1.50).

CHAPTER 31
Household and Firm Behavior in the Macroeconomy: A Further Look 619
An increase in wealth can also be looked on as an increase in nonlabor income. Nonlabor, or
nonwage, income is income received from sources other than working—inheritances, interest,
dividends, and transfer payments such as welfare payments and Social Security payments. As
with wealth, an unexpected increase in nonlabor income will have a positive effect on a house-
hold’s consumption.
What about the effect of an increase in wealth or nonlabor income on labor supply? We
already know that an increase in income results in an increase in the consumption of normal
goods, including leisure. Therefore, an unexpected increase in wealth or nonlabor income
results in an increase in consumption and an increase in leisure. With leisure increasing, labor
supply must fall. So an unexpected increase in wealth or nonlabor income leads to a decrease in
labor supply. This point should be obvious. If you suddenly win a million dollars in the state lot-
tery or make a killing in the stock market, you will probably work less in the future than you oth-
erwise would have.
Interest Rate Effects on Consumption
Recall from the last few chapters that the interest rate affects a firm’s investment decision. A
higher interest rate leads to a lower level of planned investment and vice versa. This was a key link
between the money market and the goods market, and it was the channel through which mone-
tary policy had an impact on planned aggregate expenditure.
We can now expand on this link: The interest rate also affects household behavior. Consider
the effect of a fall in the interest rate on consumption. A fall in the interest rate lowers the reward
to saving. If the interest rate falls from 10 percent to 5 percent, you earn 5¢ instead of 10¢ per year
on every dollar saved. This means that the opportunity cost of spending a dollar today (instead of
saving it and consuming it plus the interest income a year from now) has fallen. You will substi-
tute toward current consumption and away from future consumption when the interest rate falls:
You consume more today and save less. A rise in the interest rate leads you to consume less today
and save more. This effect is called the substitution effect.
There is also an income effect of an interest rate change on consumption. If a household has
positive wealth and is earning interest on that wealth, a fall in the interest rate leads to a fall in
interest income. This is a decrease in its nonlabor income, which, as we just saw, has a negative
effect on consumption. For households with positive wealth, the income effect works in the
opposite direction from the substitution effect. On the other hand, if a household is a debtor
and is paying interest on its debt, a fall in the interest rate will lead to a fall in interest payments.
The household is better off in this case and will consume more. In this case, the income and sub-
stitution effects work in the same direction. The total household sector in the United States has
positive wealth, and so in the aggregate, the income and substitution effects work in the oppo-
site direction.
On balance, the data suggest that the substitution effect dominates the income effect so that the
interest rate has a negative net effect on consumption: Interest rate increases cause consumption to
fall. There is also some evidence, however, that the income effect is getting larger over time. U.S.
households own most of the U.S. government debt, and the size of this debt has increased dramati-
cally in the last 25 years. This means that the change in government interest payments (and so the
change in household interest income) is now larger for a given change in interest rates than before,
which leads to a larger income effect than before for a given change in interest rates.On net,this tells
us that interest rate increases will cause consumption to fall less as the income effect grows.
Government Effects on Consumption and Labor Supply:
Taxes and Transfers
The government influences household behavior mainly through income tax rates and transfer
payments. When the government raises income tax rates, after-tax real wages decrease, lower-
ing consumption. When the government lowers income tax rates, after-tax real wages
increase, raising consumption. A change in income tax rates also affects labor supply. If the
substitution effect dominates, as we are generally assuming, an increase in income tax rates,
which lowers after-tax wages, will lower labor supply. A decrease in income tax rates will
increase labor supply.
nonlabor, or nonwage, income
Any income received from
sources other than working—
inheritances, interest,
dividends, transfer payments,
and so on.

620
PART VI
Further Macroeconomics Issues 
Transfer payments are payments such as Social Security benefits, veterans’ benefits, and wel-
fare benefits. An increase in transfer payments is an increase in nonlabor income, which we have
seen has a positive effect on consumption and a negative effect on labor supply. Increases in
transfer payments thus increase consumption and decrease labor supply, while decreases in
transfer payments decrease consumption and increase labor supply. Table 31.1 summarizes
these results.

A Possible Employment Constraint on Households
Our discussion of the labor supply decision has so far proceeded as if households were free to
choose how much to work each period. If a member of a household decides to work an additional
5 hours a week at the current wage rate, we have assumed that the person can work 5 hours
more—that work is available. If someone who has not been working decides to work at the cur-
rent wage rate, we have assumed that the person can find a job.
There are times when these assumptions do not hold. The Great Depression, when unemploy-
ment rates reached 25 percent of the labor force, led to the birth of macroeconomics in the 1930s.
Since the mid-1970s,the United States has experienced five recessions,with high unemployment rates.
When there is unemployment, some households feel an additional constraint on their behavior.
Some people may want to work 40 hours per week at the current wage rates but may find only
part-time work. Others may not find any work at all.
How does a household respond when it is constrained from working as much as it would
like? It consumes less. If your current wage rate is $10 per hour and you normally work 40 hours
a week, your normal income from wages is $400 per week. If your average tax rate is 20 percent,
your after-tax wage income is $320 per week. You are likely to spend much of this income during
the week. If you are prevented from working, this income will not be available to you and you will
have less to spend. You will spend something, of course. You may receive some form of nonlabor
income, and you may have assets such as savings deposits or stocks and bonds that can be with-
drawn or sold. You also may be able to borrow during your period of unemployment. Even
though you will spend something during the week, you almost certainly will spend less than you
would have if you had your usual income of $320 in after-tax wages.
A household constrained from working as much as it would like at the current wage rate
faces a different decision from the decision facing a household that can work as much as it
wants. The work decision of the former household is, in effect, forced on it. The household
works as much as it can—a certain number of hours per week or perhaps none at all—but this
amount is less than the household would choose to work at the current wage rate if it could find
more work. The amount that a household would like to work at the current wage rate if it could
find the work is called its unconstrained supply of labor. The amount that the household actu-
ally works in a given period at current wage rates is called its constrained supply of labor.
A household’s constrained supply of labor is not a variable over which it has any control.
The amount of labor the household supplies is imposed on it from the outside by the workings
of the economy. However, the household’s consumption is under its control. We have just seen
that the less a household works—that is, the smaller the household’s constrained supply of labor
is—the lower its consumption. Constraints on the supply of labor are an important determi-
nant of consumption when there is unemployment.
Keynesian Theory Revisited
Recall the Keynesian theory that current income
determines current consumption. We now know the consumption decision is made jointly
with the labor supply decision and the two depend on the real wage rate. It is incorrect to

CHAPTER 31
Household and Firm Behavior in the Macroeconomy: A Further Look 621
think that consumption depends only on income, at least when there is full employment.
However, if there is unemployment, Keynes is closer to being correct because the level
of income (at least workers’ income) depends exclusively on the employment decisions
made by firms and not on household decisions. In this case, it is income that affects con-
sumption, not the wage rate. For this reason Keynesian theory is considered to pertain to
periods of unemployment. It was, of course, precisely during such a period that the theory
was developed.
A Summary of Household Behavior
This completes our discussion of household behavior in the macroeconomy. Household con-
sumption depends on more than current income. Households determine consumption and labor
supply simultaneously, and they look ahead in making their decisions.
The following factors affect household consumption and labor supply decisions:
 Current and expected future real wage rates
 Initial value of wealth
 Current and expected future nonlabor income
 Interest rates
 Current and expected future tax rates and transfer payments
If households are constrained in their labor supply decisions, income is directly determined
by firms’ hiring decisions. In this case, we can say (in the traditional, Keynesian way) that
“income” affects consumption.
The Household Sector Since 1970
To better understand household behavior, let us examine how some of the aggregate house-
hold variables have changed over time. We will discuss the period 1970 I–2010 I.
(Remember, Roman numerals refer to quarters, that is, 1970 I means the first quarter
of 1970.) Within this span, there have been five recessionary periods: 1974 I–1975 I,
1980 II–1982 IV, 1990 III–1991 I, 2001 I–2001 III, and 2008 I–2009 II. How did the house-
hold variables behave during each period?
Consumption
Data on the total consumption of the household sector are in the national
income accounts. As we saw in Table 21.2 on p. 426, personal consumption expenditures
accounted for 70.8 percent of GDP in 2009. The three basic categories of consumption expendi-
tures are services, nondurable goods, and durable goods.
Figure 31.2 plots the data for consumption expenditures on services and nondurable goods
combined and for consumption expenditures on durable goods. The variables are in real terms.

1970 I–2010 I
Over time, expenditures on ser-
vices and nondurable goods are
“smoother” than expenditures
on durable goods.

622
PART VI
Further Macroeconomics Issues 
You can see that expenditures on services and nondurable goods are “smoother” over time than
expenditures on durable goods. For example, the decrease in expenditures on services and non-
durable goods was much smaller during the five recessionary periods than the decrease in expen-
ditures on durable goods.
Why do expenditures on durables fluctuate more than expenditures on services and non-
durables? When times are bad, people can postpone the purchase of durable goods, which they
do. It follows that expenditures on these goods change the most. When times are tough, you do
not have to have a new car or a new washer-dryer; you can make do with your old Chevy or
Maytag until things get better. When your income falls, it is not as easy to postpone the service
costs of day care or health care. Nondurables fall into an intermediate category, with some items
(such as new clothes) easier to postpone than others (such as food).
Housing Investment
Another important expenditure of the household sector is housing
investment (purchases of new housing), plotted in Figure 31.3. Housing investment is the most
easily postponable of all household expenditures, and it has large fluctuations. The fluctuations
are remarkable between 2003 and 2010. Housing investment rose rapidly between 2003 and 2005
and then came crashing down. As discussed in Chapter 30, much of this was driven by a huge
increase and then decrease in housing prices.
Labor Supply
As we noted in Chapters 22 and 29, a person is considered a part of the labor
force when he or she is working or has been actively looking for work in the past few weeks. The
ratio of the labor force to the total working-age population—those 16 and over—is the labor force
participation rate.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Household Reactions to Winning the Lottery
Smith prepares to leave office after 
winning lottery
The Baltimore Sun
MARTINSBURG - For 22 years, Randy Smith has devoted his
life to public service, including two terms as Berkeley County
sheriff and 12 years as a deputy, as well as nearly two years
as a magistrate.
But on Friday, Smith prepared to start a new chapter in his
life, although it still will be based on helping others.
Instead of working in public office, Smith plans to use
some of his new Powerball lottery winnings to fund worthy
projects and also help individuals.
“Life is short sometimes. But I want to do what I can for
my family and enjoy the end of my life, plus help the com-
munity that’s helped me all my life,” said Smith, 63, a
Berkeley County native who won the $79 million Powerball
late last month.
At that time, Smith chose to take a cash payout that
yielded approximately $44 million.

The more nuanced theory of consumption that we have explored
in this chapter makes some predictions about what households
will do if they have a sudden increase in wealth. Of course, such
increases are uncommon, but winning the lottery is one such
example. The following article describes the reaction of a long-
time sheriff who won a $79 million Powerball lottery in 2010. As
the theory predicts, Mr. Smith is quitting his job. Interestingly, he
also has plans to increase his charitable giving, which most econo-
mists would also predict. A study by three economists, Guido
Imbens, Donald Rubin, and Bruce Sacerdote, of a large sample of
lottery winners found that winning reduced work hours by 11 per-
cent and that of the first half of lottery winnings received, 16 per-
cent on average was saved.1

Consumption: Evidence from a Survey of Lottery Players.” American Economic

CHAPTER 31
Household and Firm Behavior in the Macroeconomy: A Further Look 623
It is informative to divide the labor force into three categories: males 25 to 54, females 25 to
54, and all others 16 and over. Ages 25 to 54 are sometimes called “prime” ages, presuming that a
person is in the prime of working life during these ages. The participation rates for these three
groups are plotted in Figure 31.4.
As the figure shows, most men of prime age are in the labor force, although the participation
rate has fallen since 1970—from .961 in 1970 I to .892 in 2010 I. (A rate of .892 means that
89.2 percent of prime-age men were in the labor force.) The participation rate for prime-age
women, on the other hand, rose dramatically between 1970 and 1990—from .501 in 1970 I to
.741 in 1990 I. Although economic factors account for some of this increase, a change in social
attitudes and preferences probably explains much of the increase. Since 1990, the participation
rate for prime-age women has changed very little. In 2010 I, it was .757, still considerably below
the .892 rate for prime-age men.
Figure 31.4 also shows the participation rate for all individuals 16 and over except
prime-age men and women. This rate has some cyclical features—it tends to fall in reces-
sions and to rise or fall less during expansions. These features reveal the operation of the
discouraged-worker effect, discussed in Chapter 22. During recessions, some people get dis-
couraged about ever finding a job. They stop looking and are then not considered a part of
the labor force. During expansions, people become encouraged again. Once they begin look-
ing for jobs, they are again considered a part of the labor force. Because prime-age women
and men are likely to be fairly attached to the labor force, the discouraged-worker effect for
them is quite small.

PART VI
Further Macroeconomics Issues 
Firms: Investment and Employment Decisions
Having taken a closer look at the behavior of households in the macroeconomy, we now look
more closely at the behavior of firms—the other major decision-making unit in the economy. In
discussing firm behavior earlier, we assumed that planned investment depends only on the inter-
est rate. However, there are several other determinants of planned investment. We now discuss
them and the factors that affect firms’ employment decisions. Once again, microeconomic theory
can help us gain some insight into the working of the macroeconomy.
In a market economy, firms determine which goods and services are available to consumers
today and which will be available in the future, how many workers are needed for what kinds of
jobs, and how much investment will be undertaken. Stated in macroeconomic terms, the deci-
sions of firms, taken together, determine output, labor demand, and investment.
Expectations and Animal Spirits
Time is a key factor in investment decisions. Capital has a life that typically extends over
many years. A developer who decides to build an office tower is making an investment that
will be around (barring earthquakes, floods, or tornadoes) for several decades. In deciding
where to build a plant, a manufacturing firm is committing a large amount of resources to
purchase capital that will presumably yield services over a long time. Furthermore, the deci-
sion to build a plant or to purchase large equipment must often be made years before the
actual project is completed. Whereas the acquisition of a small business computer may take
only a few days, the planning process for downtown developments in large U.S. cities has
been known to take decades.
For these reasons, investment decisions require looking into the future and forming expecta-
tions about it. In forming their expectations, firms consider numerous factors. At a minimum,
they gather information about the demand for their specific products, about what their competi-
tors are planning, and about the macroeconomy’s overall health. A firm is not likely to increase its
production capacity if it does not expect to sell more of its product in the future. Hilton will not
put up a new hotel if it does not expect to fill the rooms at a profitable rate. Ford will not build a
new plant if it expects the economy to enter a long recession.
Forecasting the future is fraught with dangers. Many events cannot be foreseen. Investments
are therefore always made with imperfect knowledge. Keynes pointed this out in 1936:
The outstanding fact is the extreme precariousness of the basis of knowledge on which
our estimates of prospective yield have to be made. Our knowledge of the factors which
will govern the yield of an investment some years hence is usually very slight and often
negligible. If we speak frankly, we have to admit that our basis of knowledge for estimat-
ing the yield ten years hence of a railway, a copper mine, a textile factory, the goodwill of
a patent medicine, an Atlantic liner, a building in the City of London amounts to little
and sometimes nothing.
Keynes concludes from this line of thought that much investment activity depends on psychology
and on what he calls the animal spirits of entrepreneurs:
Our decisions . . . can only be taken as a result of animal spirits. In estimating the
prospects of investment, we must have regard, therefore, to nerves and hysteria and even
the digestions and reactions to the weather of those upon whose spontaneous activity it
largely depends.3
Because expectations about the future are, as Keynes points out, subject to great uncertainty,
they may change often. Thus, animal spirits help to make investment a volatile component
of GDP.

describe investors’ feelings.

CHAPTER 31
Household and Firm Behavior in the Macroeconomy: A Further Look 625
The Accelerator Effect
Expectations, at least in part, are thus likely to determine the level
of planned investment spending. At any interest rate, the level of investment is likely to be higher
if businesses are optimistic and lower if they are pessimistic. A key question is then what deter-
mine expectations? One possibility, is that expectations are optimistic when aggregate output (Y)
is rising and pessimistic when aggregate output is falling. At any given level of the interest rate,
expectations may be more optimistic and planned investment higher when output is growing
rapidly than when it is growing slowly or falling. It is easy to see why this might be so. When firms
expect future prospects to be good, they may plan now to add productive capacity, and one indi-
cator of future prospects is the current growth rate.
If this is the case, the result will be what is called an accelerator effect. If aggregate output
(income) (Y) is rising, investment will increase even though the level of Y may be low. Higher
investment spending leads to an added increase in output, further “accelerating” the growth of
aggregate output. If Y is falling, expectations are dampened and investment spending will be cut
even though the level of Y may be high, accelerating the decline.
Excess Labor and Excess Capital Effects
In practice, firms appear at times to hold what we will call excess labor and/or excess capital. A
firm holds excess labor (or capital) if it can reduce the amount of labor it employs (or capital it
holds) and still produce the same amount of output. Why would a firm want to employ more
workers or have more capital on hand than it needs? Both labor and capital are costly—a firm has
to pay wages to its workers, and it forgoes interest on funds tied up in machinery or buildings.
Why would a firm want to incur costs that do not yield revenue?
To see why, suppose a firm suffers a sudden and large decrease in sales, but it expects the lower
sales level to last only a few months,after which it believes sales will pick up again.In this case,the firm
is likely to lower production in response to the sales change to avoid too large an increase in its stock
of inventories. This decrease in production means that the firm could get rid of some workers and
some machines because it needs less labor and less capital to produce the now-lower level of output.
However, things are not that simple. Decreasing its workforce and capital stock quickly can
be costly for a firm. Abrupt cuts in the workforce hurt worker morale and may increase personnel
administration costs, and abrupt reductions in capital stock may be disadvantageous because of
the difficulty of selling used machines. These types of costs are sometimes called adjustment
costs because they are the costs of adjusting to the new level of output. There are also adjustment
costs to increasing output. For example, it is usually costly to recruit and train new workers.
Adjustment costs may be large enough that a firm chooses not to decrease its workforce and cap-
ital stock when production falls.The firm may at times choose to have more labor and capital on hand
than it needs to produce its current amount of output simply because getting rid of them is more
costly than keeping them.In practice,excess labor takes the form of workers not working at their nor-
mal level of activity (more coffee breaks and more idle time, for instance). Some of this excess labor
may receive new training so that productivity will be higher when production picks up again.
The existence of excess labor and capital at any given moment is likely to affect future
employment and investment decisions. Suppose a firm already has excess labor and capital due to
a fall in its sales and production. When production picks up again, the firm will not need to hire
as many new workers or acquire as much new capital as it would otherwise. The more excess cap-
ital a firm already has, the less likely it is to invest in new capital in the future. The more excess
labor it has, the less likely it is to hire new workers in the future.
Inventory Investment
We now turn to a brief discussion of the inventory investment decision. Inventory investment is
the change in the stock of inventories. Although inventory investment is another way in which a
firm adds to its capital stock, the inventory investment decision is quite different from the plant-
and-equipment investment decision.
The Role of Inventories
Recall the distinction between a firm’s sales and its output.If a firm
can hold goods in inventory, which is usually the case unless the good is perishable or unless the
firm produces services, then within a given period, it can sell a quantity of goods that differs from

the quantity of goods it produces during that period. When a firm sells more than it produces, its
stock of inventories decreases; when it sells less than it produces, its stock of inventories increases.
If a firm starts a period with 100 umbrellas in inventory, produces 15 umbrellas during the
period, and sells 10 umbrellas in this same interval, it will have 105 umbrellas (100 + 15 - 10) in
inventory at the end of the period. A change in the stock of inventories is actually investment
because inventories are counted as part of a firm’s capital stock. In our example, inventory invest-
ment during the period is a positive number, 5 umbrellas (105 - 100). When the number of goods
produced is less than the number of goods sold, such as 5 produced and 10 sold, inventory invest-
ment is negative.
The Optimal Inventory Policy
We can now consider firms’ inventory decisions. Firms are
concerned with what they are going to sell and produce in the future as well as what they are selling and
producing currently.At each point in time, a firm has some idea of how much it is going to sell in the
current period and in future periods. Given these expectations and its knowledge of how much of its
gooditalreadyhasinstock,afirmmustdecidehowmuchtoproduceinthecurrentperiod.Inventories
are costly to a firm because they take up space and they tie up funds that could be earning interest.
However,if a firm’s stock of inventories gets too low,the firm may have difficulty meeting the demand
for its product, especially if demand increases unexpectedly. The firm may lose sales. The point
between too low and too high a stock of inventory is called the desired, or optimal, level of
inventories. This is the level at which the extra cost (in lost sales) from decreasing inventories by a
small amount is just equal to the extra gain (in interest revenue and decreased storage costs).
A firm that had no costs other than inventory costs would always aim to produce in a
period exactly the volume of goods necessary to make its stock of inventories at the end of
the period equal to the desired stock. If the stock of inventory fell lower than desired, the
firm would produce more than it expected to sell to bring the stock up. If the stock of inven-
tory grew above the desired level, the firm would produce less than it expected to sell to
reduce the stock.
There are other costs to running a firm besides inventory costs. In particular, large and
abrupt changes in production can be very costly because it is often disruptive to change a
production process geared to a certain rate of output. If production is to be increased, there
may be adjustment costs for hiring more labor and increasing the capital stock. If produc-
tion is to be decreased, there may be adjustment costs in laying off workers and decreasing
the capital stock.
Because holding inventories and changing production levels are both costly, firms face a trade-
off between them. Because of adjustment costs, a firm is likely to smooth its production path rela-
tive to its sales path. This means that a firm is likely to have its production fluctuate less than its
sales, with changes in inventories to absorb the difference each period. However, because there are
incentives not to stray too far from the optimal level of inventories, fluctuations in production are
not eliminated completely. Production is still likely to fluctuate, just not as much as sales fluctuate.
Two other points need to be made here. First, if a firm’s stock of inventories is unusually or
unexpectedly high, the firm is likely to produce less in the future than it otherwise would have in
order to decrease its high stock of inventories. In other words, although the stock of inventories
fluctuates over time because production is smoothed relative to sales, at any point in time, inven-
tories may be unexpectedly high or low because sales have been unexpectedly low or high. An
unexpectedly high stock will have a negative effect on production in the future, and an unexpect-
edly low stock will have a positive effect on production in the future. An unexpected increase in
inventories has a negative effect on future production, and an unexpected decrease in inventories
has a positive effect on future production.
Second, firms do not know their future sales exactly. They have expectations of future sales,
and these expectations may not turn out to be exactly right. This has important consequences. If
sales turn out to be less than expected, inventories will be higher than expected and there will be
less production in the future. Furthermore, future sales expectations are likely to have an impor-
tant effect on current production. If a firm expects its sales to be high in the future, it will adjust
its planned production path accordingly. Even though a firm smooths production relative to
sales, over a long time, it must produce as much as it sells. If it does not, it will eventually run out

of inventories. The level of a firm’s planned production path depends on the level of its expected
future sales path. If a firm’s expectations of the level of its future sales path decrease, the firm is
likely to decrease the level of its planned production path, including its actual production in the
current period. Current production depends on expected future sales.
Because production is likely to depend on expectations of the future, animal spirits may play
a role. If firms become more optimistic about the future, they are likely to produce more now.
Keynes’s view that animal spirits affect investment is also likely to pertain to output.
A Summary of Firm Behavior
The following factors affect firms’ investment and employment decisions:
 Firms’ expectations of future output
 Wage rate and cost of capital (the interest rate is an important component of the cost of capital)
 Amount of excess labor and excess capital on hand
The most important points to remember about the relationship among production, sales,
and inventory investment are
 Inventory investment—that is, the change in the stock of inventories—equals production
minus sales.
 An unexpected increase in the stock of inventories has a negative effect on future production.
 Current production depends on expected future sales.
The Firm Sector Since 1970
To close our discussion of firm behavior, we now examine some aggregate investment and
employment variables for the period 1970 I–2010 I.
Plant-and-Equipment Investment
Plant-and-equipment investment by the firm sec-
tor is plotted in Figure 31.5. Investment fared poorly in the five recessionary periods after 1970.
This observation is consistent with the observation that investment depends in part on output.
An examination of the plot of real GDP in Figure 20.4 on p. 418 and the plot of investment in
Figure 31.5 shows that investment generally does poorly when GDP does poorly and that invest-
ment generally does well when GDP does well.
Figure 31.5 also shows that investment fluctuates greatly. This is not surprising. The animal
spirits of entrepreneurs are likely to be volatile, and if animal spirits affect investment, it follows
that investment too will be volatile.
Despite the volatility of plant-and-equipment investment, however, it is still true that hous-
ing investment fluctuates more than plant-and-equipment investment (as you can see by

comparing Figures 31.3 and 31.5). Plant-and-equipment investment is not the most volatile
component of GDP.
Employment
Employment in the firm sector is plotted in Figure 31.6, which shows that
employment fell in all five recessionary periods. This is consistent with the theory that
employment depends in part on output. Otherwise, employment has grown over time 
in response to the growing economy. Employment in the firm sector rose from 72.6 million
in 1970 I to 132.8 million in 2007 IV (before the recession of 2008–2009). During the 
2008–2009 recession employment fell by 9.4 million—from 131.9 million in 2007 IV to 
122.5 million in 2009 IV.
Inventory Investment
Recall that inventory investment is the difference between the level
of output and the level of sales. Recall also that some inventory investment is usually unplanned.
This occurs when the actual level of sales is different from the expected level of sales.
Inventory investment of the firm sector is plotted in Figure 31.7. Also plotted in this figure is
the ratio of the stock of inventories to the level of sales—the inventory/sales ratio. The figure shows
that inventory investment is very volatile—more volatile than housing investment and plant-and-
equipment investment. Some of this volatility is undoubtedly due to the unplanned component of
inventory investment, which is likely to fluctuate greatly from one period to the next.
When the inventory/sales ratio is high, the actual stock of inventories is likely to be
larger than the desired stock. In such a case, firms have overestimated demand and produced
too much relative to sales and they are likely to want to produce less in the future to draw
down their stock. You can find several examples of this trend in Figure 31.7—the clearest
occurred during the 1974–1975 period. At the end of 1974, the stock of inventories was very
high relative to sales, an indication that firms probably had undesired inventories at the end
of 1974. In 1975, firms worked off these undesired inventories by producing less than they
sold. Thus, inventory investment was very low in 1975. The year 1975 is clearly a year in
which output would have been higher had the stock of inventories at the beginning of the
year not been so high. There were large declines in inventory investment in the recessions of
2001 and 2008–2009.
On average, the inventory/sales ratio has been declining over time, evidence that firms are
becoming more efficient in their management of inventory stocks. Firms are becoming more effi-
cient in the sense of being able (other things equal) to hold smaller and smaller stocks of inven-
tories relative to sales.

CHAPTER 31
Household and Firm Behavior in the Macroeconomy: A Further Look 629
Productivity and the Business Cycle
We can now use what we have just learned about firm behavior to analyze movements in produc-
tivity. Productivity, sometimes called labor productivity, is defined as output per worker hour. If
output is Y and the number of hours worked in the economy is H, productivity is Y/H. Simply
stated, productivity measures how much output an average worker produces per hour.
Productivity fluctuates over the business cycle, tending to rise during expansions and fall during
contractions. See Figure 22.2 on p. 453 for a plot of productivity for 1952 I–2010 I.You can see from
this figure that productivity fluctuates up and down around a positive trend. The fact that firms at
times hold excess labor explains why productivity fluctuates in the same direction as output.
Figure 31.8 shows the pattern of employment and output over time for a hypothetical econ-
omy. Employment does not fluctuate as much as output over the business cycle. It 
is precisely this pattern that leads to higher productivity during periods of high output and lower
productivity during periods of low output. During expansions in the economy, output rises by a
larger percentage than employment and the ratio of output to workers rises. During downswings,
output falls faster than employment and the ratio of output to workers falls.
The existence of excess labor when the economy is in a slump means that productivity as mea-
sured by the ratio Y/H tends to fall at such times.Does this trend mean that labor is in some sense “less

productive”during recessions than before? Not really: It means only that firms choose to employ more
labor than they need. For this reason, some workers are in effect idle some of the time even though
they are considered employed.They are not less productive in the sense of having less potential to pro-
duce output; they are merely not working part of the time that they are counted as working.
The Short-Run Relationship Between
Output and Unemployment
We can also use what we have learned about household and firm behavior to analyze the relation-
ship between output and unemployment. When we discussed the connections between the
AS/AD diagram and the Phillips Curve in Chapter 29, we mentioned that output (Y) and the
unemployment rate (U) are inversely related. When output rises, the unemployment rate falls,
and when output falls, the unemployment rate rises. At one time, it was believed that the short-
run relationship between the two variables was fairly stable. Okun’s Law (after U.S. economist
Arthur Okun, who first studied the relationship) stated that in the short run the unemployment
rate decreased about 1 percentage point for every 3 percent increase in real GDP. As with the
Phillips Curve, Okun’s Law has not turned out to be a “law.” The economy is far too complex for
there to be such a simple and stable relationship between two macroeconomic variables.
Although the short-run relationship between output and the unemployment rate is not the sim-
ple relationship Okun believed, it is true that a 1 percent increase in output tends to correspond to a
less than 1 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate in the short run. In other words,
there are a number of“slippages”between changes in output and changes in the unemployment rate.
The first slippage is between the change in output and the change in the number of jobs in
the economy. When output increases by 1 percent, the number of jobs does not tend to rise by
1 percent in the short run. There are two reasons for this. First, a firm is likely to meet some of the
increase in output by increasing the number of hours worked per job. Instead of having the labor
force work 40 hours per week, the firm may pay overtime and have the labor force work 42 hours
per week. Second, if a firm is holding excess labor at the time of the output increase, at least part
of the increase in output can come from putting the excess labor back to work. For both reasons,
the number of jobs is likely to rise by a smaller percentage than the increase in output.
The second slippage is between the change in the number of jobs and the change in the
number of people employed. If you have two jobs, you are counted twice in the job data but only
once in the persons-employed data. Because some people have two jobs, there are more jobs than 
there are people employed. When the number of jobs increases, some of the new jobs are filled by
people who already have one job (instead of by people who are unemployed). This means that the
increase in the number of people employed is less than the increase in the number of jobs. This is
a slippage between output and the unemployment rate because the unemployment rate is calcu-
lated from data on the number of people employed, not the number of jobs.
The third slippage concerns the response of the labor force to an increase in output. Let E
denote the number of people employed, let L denote the number of people in the labor force, and
let u denote the unemployment rate. In these terms, the unemployment rate is
u = 1 - E/L
The unemployment rate is 1 minus the employment rate, E/L.
When we discussed how the unemployment rate is measured in Chapter 22, we introduced
the discouraged-worker effect.A discouraged worker is one who would like a job but has stopped
looking because the prospects seem so bleak. When output increases, job prospects begin to look
better and some people who had stopped looking for work begin looking again. When they do,
they are once again counted as part of the labor force. The labor force increases when output
increases because discouraged workers are moving back into the labor force. This is another reason
the unemployment rate does not fall as much as might be expected when output increases.
These three slippages show that the link from changes in output to changes in the unemploy-
ment rate is complicated.All three combine to make the change in the unemployment rate less than
the percentage change in output in the short run. They also show that the relationship between
changes in output and changes in the unemployment rate is not likely to be stable. The size of the
first slippage, for example, depends on how much excess labor is being held at the time of the output
Okun’s Law
The theory, put
forth by Arthur Okun, that in
the short run the unemploy-
ment rate decreases about 
1 percentage point for every 
3 percent increase in real GDP.

shown that the relationship
between output and
unemployment is not as stable
as Okun’s “Law” predicts.

increase, and the size of the third slippage depends on what else is affecting the labor force (such as
changes in real wage rates) at the time of the output increase. The relationship between output and
unemployment depends on the state of the economy at the time of the output change.
The Size of the Multiplier
We can finally bring together the material in this chapter and in previous chapters to consider the
size of the multiplier. We mentioned in Chapter 23 that much of the analysis we would do after
deriving the simple multiplier would have the effect of decreasing the size of the multiplier. We
can now summarize why.
1. There are automatic stabilizers. We saw in the Appendix to Chapter 24 that if taxes are not a
fixed amount but instead depend on income (which is surely the case in practice), the size
of the multiplier is decreased. When the economy expands and income increases, the
amount of taxes collected increases. The rise in taxes acts to offset some of the expansion
(thus, a smaller multiplier). When the economy contracts and income decreases, the
amount of taxes collected decreases. This decrease in taxes helps to lessen the contraction.
Some transfer payments also respond to the state of the economy and act as automatic sta-
bilizers, lowering the value of the multiplier. Unemployment benefits are the best example
of transfer payments that increase during contractions and decrease during expansions.
2. There is the interest rate. We saw in Chapter 27 that if government spending increases and the
money supply remains unchanged, the interest rate increases, which decreases planned invest-
ment and aggregate output (income). This crowding out of planned investment decreases the
value of the multiplier. As we saw earlier in this chapter, increases in the interest rate also have
a negative effect on consumption. Consumption is also crowded out in the same way that
planned investment is, and this effect lowers the value of the multiplier even further.
3. There is the response of the price level. We also saw in Chapter 27 that some of the effect of
an expansionary policy is to increase the price level. The multiplier is smaller because of this
price response. The multiplier is particularly small when the economy is on the steep part of
the AS curve, where most of the effect of an expansionary policy is to increase prices.
4. There are excess capital and excess labor. When firms are holding excess labor and capital,
part of any output increase can come from putting the excess labor and capital back to work
instead of increasing employment and investment. This lowers the value of the multiplier
because (1) investment increases less than it would have if there were no excess capital and
(2) consumption increases less than it would have if employment (and thus household
income) had increased more.
5. There are inventories. Part of any initial increase in sales can come from drawing down
inventories instead of increasing output. To the extent that firms draw down their invento-
ries in the short run, the value of the multiplier is lower because output does not respond as
quickly to demand changes.
6. There are people’s expectations about the future. People look ahead, and they respond less to
temporary changes than to permanent changes. The multiplier effects for policy changes per-
ceived to be temporary are smaller than those for policy changes perceived to be permanent.
The Size of the Multiplier in Practice
In practice, the multiplier probably has a value
of around 2.0. Its size also depends on how long ago the spending increase began. For example, in
the first quarter of an increase in government spending, the multiplier is only about 1.1. If gov-
ernment spending rises by $1 billion, GDP will increase by about $1.1 billion during the first
quarter. In the second quarter, the multiplier will rise to about 1.6. The multiplier then will rise to
its peak of about 2.0 in the fourth quarter.
One of the main points to remember here is that if the government is contemplating a mon-
etary or fiscal policy change, the response of the economy to the change is not likely to be large
and quick. It takes time for the full effects to be felt, and in the final analysis, the effects are much
smaller than the simple multiplier we discussed in Chapter 23 would lead one to believe.
A good way to review much of the material since Chapter 23 is to make sure you clearly
understand how the value of the multiplier is affected by each of the additions to the simple
model in Chapter 23. We have come a long way since then, and this review may help you to put all
the pieces together.

HOUSEHOLDS: CONSUMPTION AND LABOR SUPPLY
DECISIONS p. 615
1. The life-cycle theory of consumption says that households
make lifetime consumption decisions based on their expec-
tations of lifetime income. Generally, households consume
an amount less than their incomes during their prime work-
ing years and an amount greater than their incomes during
their early working years and after they have retired.
2. Households make consumption and labor supply decisions
simultaneously. Consumption cannot be considered separately
from labor supply because it is precisely by selling your labor
that you earn the income that makes consumption possible.
3. There is a trade-off between the goods and services that
wage income will buy and leisure or other nonmarket activi-
ties. The wage rate is the key variable that determines how a
household responds to this trade-off.
4. Changes in the wage rate have both an income effect and a
substitution effect. The evidence suggests that the substitution
effect seems to dominate for most people, which means that
the aggregate labor supply responds positively to an increase
in the wage rate.
5. Consumption increases when the wage rate increases.
6. The nominal wage rate is the wage rate in current dollars.
The real wage rate is the amount the nominal wage can buy
in terms of goods and services. Households look at expected
future real wage rates as well as the current real wage rate in
making their consumption and labor supply decisions.
7. Holding all else constant (including the stage in the life
cycle), the more wealth a household has, the more it will
consume both now and in the future.
8. An unexpected increase in nonlabor income (any income
received from sources other than working, such as inheri-
tances, interest, and dividends) will have a positive effect on
a household’s consumption and will lead to a decrease in
labor supply.
9. The interest rate also affects consumption, although the
direction of the total effect depends on the relative sizes
of the income and substitution effects. There is some evi-
dence that the income effect is larger now than it used to
be, making monetary policy less effective than it used 
to be.
10. The government influences household behavior mainly
through income tax rates and transfer payments. If the sub-
stitution effect dominates, an increase in tax rates lowers
after-tax income, decreases consumption, and decreases the
labor supply; a decrease in tax rates raises after-tax income,
increases consumption, and increases labor supply. Increases
in transfer payments increase consumption and decrease
labor supply; decreases in transfer payments decrease con-
sumption and increase labor supply.
11. During times of unemployment, households’ labor supply
may be constrained. Households may want to work a certain
number of hours at current wage rates but may not be
allowed to do so by firms. In this case, the level of income (at
least workers’ income) depends exclusively on the employ-
ment decisions made by firms. Households consume less if
they are constrained from working.
FIRMS: INVESTMENT AND EMPLOYMENT
DECISIONS p. 624 
12. Expectations affect investment and employment decisions.
Keynes used the term animal spirits of entrepreneurs to refer
to investors’ feelings.
13. At any level of the interest rate, expectations are likely to be
more optimistic and planned investment is likely to be higher
when output is growing rapidly than when it is growing
slowly or falling. The result is an accelerator effect that can
cause the economy to expand more rapidly during an expan-
sion and contract more quickly during a recession.
14. Excess labor and capital are labor and capital not needed to
produce a firm’s current level of output. Holding excess
labor and capital may be more efficient than laying off work-
ers or selling used equipment. The more excess capital a firm
has, the less likely it is to invest in new capital in the future.
The more excess labor it has, the less likely it is to hire new
workers in the future.
15. Holding inventories is costly to a firm because they take up
space and they tie up funds that could be earning interest.
Not holding inventories can cause a firm to lose sales if
demand increases. The desired, or optimal, level of inventories
is the level at which the extra cost (in lost sales) from lower-
ing inventories by a small amount is equal to the extra gain
(in interest revenue and decreased storage costs).
16. An unexpected increase in inventories has a negative effect
on future production, and an unexpected decrease in inven-
tories has a positive effect on future production.
17. The level of a firm’s planned production path depends on
the level of its expected future sales path. If a firm’s expecta-
tions of its future sales path decrease, the firm is likely to
decrease the level of its planned production path, including
its actual production in the current period.
PRODUCTIVITY AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE p. 629
18. Productivity, or labor productivity, is output per worker hour—
the amount of output produced by an average worker in 1 hour.
Productivity fluctuates over the business cycle, tending to rise
during expansions and fall during contractions. That workers
are less productive during contractions does not mean that they
have less potential to produce output; it means that excess labor
exists and that workers are not working at their capacity.
THE SHORT-RUN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
OUTPUT AND UNEMPLOYMENT p. 630
19. There is a negative relationship between output and
unemployment: When output (Y) rises, the unemploy-
ment rate (U) falls, and when output falls, the unemploy-
ment rate rises. Okun’s Law stated that in the short run the
unemployment rate decreases about 1 percentage point for
every 3 percent increase in GDP. Okun’s Law is not a
“law”—the economy is too complex for there to be a stable
relationship between two macroeconomic variables. In
general, the relationship between output and unemploy-
ment depends on the state of the economy at the time of
the output change.

THE SIZE OF THE MULTIPLIER p. 631
20. There are several reasons why the actual value of the mul-
tiplier is smaller than the size that would be expected
from the simple multiplier model: (1) Automatic stabiliz-
ers help to offset contractions or limit expansions. (2)
When government spending increases, the increased
interest rate crowds out planned investment and con-
sumption spending. (3) Expansionary policies increase
the price level. (4) Firms sometimes hold excess capital
and excess labor. (5) Firms may meet increased demand
by drawing down inventories instead of increasing out-
put. (6) Households and firms change their behavior less
when they expect changes to be temporary instead 
of permanent.
21. In practice, the size of the multiplier at its peak is about 2.

1. Between October 2004 and October 2005, real GDP in the
United States increased by 3.6 percent, while nonfarm payroll
jobs increased by only 1.4 percent. How is it possible for output
to increase without a proportional increase in the number 
of workers?
2. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 622] Suppose that
for your 21st birthday, your family decides to surprise you with a
weekend trip to Las Vegas. Although you are a full-time college
student and therefore do not have a large amount of money to
spend on gambling, your excitement gets the best of you as you
put $100 in a dollar slot machine. On your third pull of the
handle, you win a jackpot which pays you $50,000 after all taxes
have been taken out. Explain how the simple Keynesian model
and the life-cycle theory differ with respect to how this $50,000
jackpot might influence your consumption. How might your
answer change if instead of $50,000, your slot jackpot paid you
$1 million?
3. During 2005, the Federal Reserve Bank raised interest rates in an
effort to prevent an increase in the rate of inflation.
a. What direct effects do higher interest rates have on house-
hold and firm behavior?
b. One of the consequences of higher interest rates was that the
value of existing bonds (both corporate bonds and govern-
ment bonds) fell substantially. Explain why higher interest
rates would decrease the value of existing fixed-rate bonds
held by the public.
c. Some economists argue that the wealth effect of higher
interest rates on consumption is as important as the direct
effect of higher interest rates on investment. Explain what
economists mean by “wealth effects on consumption” and
illustrate with AS/AD curves.
4. In 2005, President Bush’s tax reform commission proposed
and Congress enacted a decrease in taxes. One of the cuts was
in the income tax rate for higher-income wage earners.
Republicans claimed that raising the rewards for working
(the net after-tax wage rate) would lead to more work effort
and a higher labor supply. Critics of the tax cuts replied that
this criticism was baseless because it “ignored the income
effect of the tax cut (net wage increase).” Explain what these
critics meant.
5. Graph the following two consumption functions:
(1)C = 300 + .5Y
(2)C = .5Y
a. For each function, calculate and graph the average propensity
to consume (APC) when income is $100, $400, and $800.
b. For each function, what happens to the APC as income rises?
c. For each function, what is the relationship between the APC
and the marginal propensity to consume?
d. Under the first consumption function, a family with income
of $50,000 consumes a smaller proportion of its income
than a family with income of $20,000; yet if we take a dollar
of income away from the rich family and give it to the poor
family, total consumption by the two families does not
change. Explain how this is possible.
6. Throughout the late 1990s, the price of houses increased
steadily around the country.
a. What impact would you expect increases and decreases in
home value to have on the consumption behavior of home
owners? Explain.
b. In what ways might events in the housing market have influ-
enced the rest of the economy through their effects on con-
sumption spending? Be specific.

*7. Adam Smith is 45 years old. He has assets (wealth) of
$20,000 and has no debts or liabilities. He knows that he will
work for 20 more years and will live 5 years after that, when
he will earn nothing. His salary each year for the rest of his
working career is $14,000. (There are no taxes.) He wants to
distribute his consumption over the rest of his life in such a
way that he consumes the same amount each year. He cannot
consume in total more than his current wealth plus the sum
of his income for the next 20 years. Assume that the rate of
interest is zero and that Smith decides not to leave any inher-
itance to his children.
a. How much will Adam consume this year and next year? How
did you arrive at your answer?
b. Plot on a graph Adam’s income, consumption, and wealth
from the time he is 45 until he is 70 years old. What is the
relationship between the annual increase in his wealth and
his annual saving (income minus consumption)? In what
year does Adam’s wealth start to decline? Why? How much
wealth does he have when he dies?
c. Suppose Adam receives a tax rebate of $100 per year, so his
income is $14,100 per year for the rest of his working career.
By how much does his consumption increase this year and
next year?
d. Now suppose Adam receives a 1-year-only tax refund of
$100—his income this year is $14,100; but in all succeeding
years, his income is $14,000. What happens to his consump-
tion this year? in succeeding years?
8. Explain why a household’s consumption and labor supply
decisions are interdependent. What impact does this interde-
pendence have on the way in which consumption and income
are related?
9. Why do expectations play such an important role in investment
demand? How, if at all, does this explain why investment is 
so volatile?
10. How can a firm maintain a smooth production schedule even
when sales are fluctuating? What are the benefits of a smooth
production schedule? What are the costs?
11. Explain the effect that each of the following situations will have
on the size of the multiplier.
a. Firms have excess inventories as the economy begins to
recover from a recession.
b. Expansionary policy causes the price level to increase.
c. People expect a $500 tax rebate to be a one-time occurrence.
d. The government decreases spending, and the Fed does not
change the money supply.
e. The economy expands, and income taxes are progressive.
f. The government extends unemployment benefits as a
response to a lingering recession.
12. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in June 2010, the
unemployment rate in the United States was 9.5 percent. In
November 2007, prior to the beginning of the recession of
2007–2009, the BLS reported an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent.
a. According to Okun’s Law, by how much would GDP need to
increase for the unemployment rate to decrease from the June
2010 rate back to the pre-recession rate of November 2007?
b. In June 2010, the annual GDP growth rate in the United
States was 2.4 percent. At this rate of growth, how long does
Okun’s Law predict it would take for the economy to return
to the unemployment rate of November 2007?
13. In the short run, the percentage increase in output tends to cor-
respond to a smaller percentage decrease in the unemployment
rate due to “slippages.” Explain the three slippages between
changes in output and changes in the unemployment rate.
14. George Jetson has recently been promoted to inventory control
manager at Spacely Sprockets, and he must decide on the optimal
level of sprockets to keep in inventory. How should Jetson decide
on the optimal level of inventory? How would a change in interest
rates affect the optimal level of inventory? What costs and benefits
will Spacely Sprockets experience by holding inventory?
15. Futurama Medical is a high-tech medical equipment manufac-
turer that uses custom-designed machinery and a highly skilled,
well-trained labor force in its production factory. Gonzo
Garments is a mid-level clothing manufacturer that uses mass-
produced machinery and readily available labor in its production
factory. Which of these two firms would you expect to have more
significant adjustment costs? Which firm would be more likely to
hold excess labor? excess capital? Explain your answers.

Long-Run Growth
Think about how many hours
your grandparents had to work to
pay for basic necessities like food
and clothing. Now think about
how many hours you will have to
work for the same thing. You will
likely spend many fewer hours.
People on average will earn in real
terms more per hour than did
people of earlier generations. This
is true in almost all economies,
but certainly in all developed
economies. Another way of saying
this is that in almost all economies
the amount of output produced
per worker has risen over time.
Why? Why are we able to produce
more per hour than prior genera-
tions did? This is the subject mat-
ter of this chapter. We explore the
long-run growth process.
We briefly introduced long-
run growth in Chapter 22. We dis-
tinguished between output growth, which is the growth rate of output of the entire economy,
and per-capita output growth, which is the growth rate of output per person in the economy.
Another important concept, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, is the growth of output per
worker, called labor productivity growth. Output per capita is a measure of the standard of liv-
ing in a country. It is not the same as output per worker because not everyone in the population
works. Output per capita can fall even when output per worker is increasing if the fraction of the
population that is working is falling (as it might be in a country with an increasing number of
children per working-age adult). Output per capita is a useful measure because it tells us how
much output each person would receive if total output were evenly divided across the entire pop-
ulation. Output per worker is a useful measure because it tells us how much output each worker
on average is producing.
We begin this chapter with a brief history of economic growth since the Industrial
Revolution. We then discuss the sources of growth–answering the question why output per
worker has risen over time. We then turn to look more narrowly at the U.S. growth picture. We
conclude with a discussion of growth and the environment, returning to the world perspective.

Economic Growth Shifts
Society’s Production

and to the Right
The production possibility fron-
tier shows all the combinations
of output that can be produced
if all society’s scarce resources
are fully and efficiently
employed. Economic growth
expands society’s production
possibilities, shifting the ppf up
and to the right.
The Growth Process: From Agriculture 
to Industry
The easiest way to understand the growth process and to identify its causes is to think about a sim-
ple economy. Recall from Chapter 2, Colleen and Bill washed up on a deserted island. At first, they
had only a few simple tools and whatever human capital they brought with them to the island. They
gathered nuts and berries and built a small cabin. Their “GDP” consisted of basic food and shelter.
Over time, things improved. The first year they cleared some land and began to cultivate a
few vegetables they found growing on the island. They made some tools and dug a small reservoir
to store rainwater. As their agricultural efforts became more efficient, they shifted their
resources—their time—into building a larger, more comfortable home.
Colleen and Bill were accumulating capital in two forms. First, they built physical capital,
material things used in the production of goods and services—a better house, tools, a water sys-
tem, perhaps a boat to let them fish farther off shore. Second, they acquired more human
capital—knowledge, skills, and talents. Through trial and error, they learned about the island and
its soil and its climate and learned what did and did not work. Both kinds of capital made them
more efficient and increased their productivity. Because it took less time to produce the food they
needed to survive, they could devote more energy to producing other things or to leisure.
At any given time, Colleen and Bill faced limits on what they could produce. These limits were
imposed by the existing state of their technical knowledge and the resources at their disposal. Over
time, they expanded their possibilities, developed new technologies, accumulated capital, and made
their labor more productive. In Chapter 2, we defined a society’s production possibility frontier (ppf),
which shows all possible combinations of output that can be produced given present technology and
whether all available resources are fully and efficiently employed. Economic growth expands those
limits and shifts society’s production possibilities frontier out to the right, as Figure 32.1 shows.
Before the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain, every society in the world was agrarian.
Towns and cities existed here and there, but almost everyone lived in rural areas. People spent
most of their time producing food and other basic subsistence goods. Then beginning in England
around 1750, technical change and capital accumulation increased productivity significantly in
two important industries: agriculture and textiles. New and more efficient methods of farming
were developed. New inventions and new machinery in spinning and weaving meant that more
could be produced with fewer resources. Just as new technology, capital equipment, and resulting
higher productivity made it possible for Colleen and Bill to spend time working on other projects
and new “products,” the British turned from agricultural production to industrial production. In
both cases, growth meant new products, more output, and wider choice.
Those changes meant that peasants and workers in eighteenth-century England who in the
past would have continued in subsistence farming could make a better living as urban workers. A
rural agrarian society was very quickly transformed into an urban industrial society.

The transition from agriculture to industry has been more recent in developing countries in
Asia. One of the hallmarks of current growth in China and Vietnam, for example, has been the
focus on manufacturing exports as a growth strategy. A visitor to Vietnam cannot help but be
struck by the pace of industrialization.
Economic growth continues today in the developed world. And while the underlying process
is still the same, the face is different. Just as Colleen and Bill devoted time to building a boat and
designing tools, the developed economies are still creating capital to increase productivity. Just as
a shovel makes it possible to dig a bigger hole, new microwave towers bring cell phone service to
places that had been out of range. Scientists work on finding a cure for Alzheimer’s disease using
tools they couldn’t have dreamed of a decade ago. Tools available on the Web make it possible for
a single law clerk in a busy law office to check hundreds of documents for the opinions of poten-
tial expert witnesses in a court case in an hour, a task that took a dozen law clerks weeks to per-
form just a few years ago. In each case, we have become more proficient at producing what we
want and need and we have freed up resources to produce new things that we want and need. For
Colleen and Bill, it was a better diet; with a boat, they could catch more fish in less time. Today it
may be better cell phone service, a fast, inexpensive color printer, or a better medical procedure.
The basic building blocks are the same. Growth comes from a bigger workforce and more
productive workers. Higher productivity comes from tools (capital), a better-educated and more
highly skilled workforce (human capital), and increasingly from innovation and technical change
(new techniques of production) and newly developed products and services.
Table 32.1 provides estimates of the growth of GDP for a number of developed and devel-
oping countries for the 17 years 1991–2007. One fact that should strike you as you look at these
numbers is the high rates of growth of China and India relative to those of the developed coun-
tries. Some economists argue that when poorer, less developed countries begin to develop, they
typically have higher growth rates as they catch-up with the more developed countries. This
idea is called convergence theory since it suggests that gaps in national incomes tend to close
over time. Indeed, more than 50 years ago, the economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron
coined the term the advantages of backwardness as a description of the phenomenon by which
less developed countries could leap ahead by borrowing technology from more developed
countries. This idea seems to fit the current experiences of China and India, as shown in the
table. On the other hand, growth rates in Africa are more modest, although still higher than
those for the developed countries. We turn now to look at the sources of economic growth.

The theory stating

Sources of Economic Growth
It will be useful to begin with a simple case where the quality of labor, L, and the quality of capital,
K, do not change over time. A worker is a worker is a worker, and a machine is a machine is a
machine. Output, Y, is produced in a production process using L and K. In most situations it seems
reasonable to assume that as labor and capital increase, so will output. The exact relationship
between these inputs and output can be described with an aggregate production function,which is
a mathematical relationship stating that total GDP (output) (Y) depends on the total amount of
labor used (L) and the total amount of capital (K) used. (Land is another possible input in the
production process,but we are assuming that land is fixed.) The numbers that are used in Tables 32.2
and 32.4, which follow, are based on the simple production function 
. Both

PART VI
Further Macroeconomics Issues  
capital and labor are needed for production (if either is equal to zero, so is output) and increases
in either result in more output. Using this construct we can now explore exactly how an economy
achieves higher output levels over time as it experiences changes in labor and capital.
Increase in Labor Supply
In our example of Colleen and Bill on an island, it is clear that adding another individual exactly like
Colleen and Bill to the workforce would increase output. A key question is how large the increase
would be? In fact, both economic theory and practice tell us that in the absence of increases in the
capital stock, as labor increases, less and less output will be added by each new worker. This effect is
called diminishing returns. It has been discussed for well over a hundred years, beginning with early
economists like Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo who began thinking about the effects of popu-
lation growth.
Malthus and Ricardo focused on agricultural output for which the central form of capital
was land. With land in limited supply, the economists reckoned that new farm laborers would be
forced to work the land more intensively or to bring less productive land into the agricultural sec-
tor. In either case, as labor supply grew, output would increase, but at a declining rate. Increases
in the labor supply would reduce labor productivity, or output per worker.
In developed economies, labor works not so much with land as with other forms of capital—
machines, computers, and the like. But diminishing returns occur in this setting as well. Table 32.2
provides an arithmetic example of diminishing returns using the aggregate production function
discussed previously. Notice in the table the relationship between the level of output and the level
of labor. With capital fixed at 100, as labor increases from 100 to eventually 130, total output
increases, but at a diminishing rate. In the last column, we see that labor productivity falls. Simply
increasing the amount of labor with no other changes in the economy decreases labor productiv-
ity because of diminishing returns.

The U.S. population and labor force have grown over time. Table 32.3.shows the growth of
the population, labor force, and employment between 1960 and 2008. In this period, the popula-
tion 16 and over grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent,the labor force grew at an annual rate of 1.6 per-
cent, and employment grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent. We will come back to this table later
in the chapter. We would expect that this increase in labor would, by itself, end up increasing
overall output levels in the United States.

CHAPTER 32
Long-Run Growth 639
Increase in Physical Capital
It is easy to see how physical capital contributes to output. Bill and Colleen digging a garden
with one shovel will be able to do more if a second shovel is added. How much more? We saw
that there are diminishing returns to labor as more and more labor is added to a fixed amount
of capital. There are likewise diminishing returns to capital as more and more capital is added to
a fixed supply of labor. The extra output from the garden that Bill and Colleen can produce
when a second shovel is added is likely to be smaller than the extra output that was produced
when the first shovel was added. If a third shovel were added, even less extra output would likely
be produced (if any).
Table 32.4 shows how an increase in capital without a corresponding increase in labor
increases output. It uses the same aggregate production function employed in Table 32.2.
Observe two things about these numbers. First, additional capital increases labor productivity—
it rises from 3.0 to 3.3 as capital is added. Second, there are diminishing returns to capital.
Increasing capital by 10 first increases output by 10—from 300 to 310. However, the second
increase of 10 yields only an output increase of 9, and the third increase of 10 yields only an out-
put increase of 8. The last column in the table shows the decline in output per capital as capital
is increased.

The U.S. capital stock has grown over time, also contributing to output growth. Table 32.5
shows the growth of capital equipment and capital structures between 1960 and 2008. (The
increase in the capital stock is the difference between gross investment and depreciation.
Remember that some capital becomes obsolete and some wears out each year.) Between 1960 and
2008 the stock of equipment grew at an annual rate of 4.4 percent and the stock of structures
grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent.

Notice the growth rates of capital in Table 32.5 (4.4 percent and 2.4 percent) are larger than
the growth rate of labor in Table 32.3 (1.6 percent). Capital has grown relative to labor in the
United States. As a result, each U.S. worker has more capital to work with now than he or she had
a hundred years ago. We see in Table 32.4 that adding more capital relative to labor increases
labor productivity. We thus have one answer so far as to why labor productivity has grown over
time in the United States—the amount of capital per worker has grown. You are able to produce
more output per hour than your grandparents did because you have more capital to work with.
In almost all economies, capital has been growing faster than labor, which is an important source
of labor productivity growth in these economies.

PART VI
Further Macroeconomics Issues  
The importance of capital in a country’s economic growth naturally leads one to ask the
question of what determines a country’s stock of capital. In the modern open economy, new cap-
ital can come from the saving of a country’s residents and/or from the investments of foreigners.
Foreign direct investment is any investment in enterprises made in a country by residents out-
side that country. Foreign direct investment has been quite influential in providing needed capi-
tal for growth in much of Southeast Asia. In Vietnam, for example, rapid growth has been led by
foreign direct investment. Very recently, we have seen signs of Chinese foreign direct investment
in parts of Africa and in other parts of Asia.
Recent work in economics has focused on the role that institutions play in creating a capital-
friendly environment that encourages home savings and foreign investment. In a series of papers,
LaPorta, Lopez de Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny argue that countries with English common law
origins (as opposed to French) provide the strongest protection for shareholders, less corrupt
governments, and better court systems. In turn, these financial and legal institutions promote
growth by encouraging capital investment. Countries with poor institutions, corruption, and
inadequate protection for lenders and investors struggle to attract capital. The World Bank calls
countries with weak institutions fragile countries.
Many of the World Bank’s fragile countries are in sub-Saharan Africa. Many observers
believe that the relative stagnation of some of the sub-Saharan African nations comes in part
from their relatively weak institutions. High costs of doing business, including corruption and
investment risks associated with conflict, have made countries such as Zimbabwe less attractive
to domestic and foreign capital. Ethnic and linguistic fractionalization have also played a role. In
the United States case growth has been facilitated by the use of foreign capital, much of which was
attracted by strong institutions.
Increase in the Quality of the Labor Supply (Human Capital)
So far we have looked at what happens when an economy gets more units of identical workers. But
as we well know, in most societies, populations have grown more educated and healthier over time.
The quality of labor has changed, as well as its quantity, and this too leads to long-run growth.
When the quality of labor increases, this is referred to as an increase in human capital. If a
worker's human capital has increased, he or she can produce more output working with the same
amount of physical capital. Labor input in efficiency terms has increased.
Human capital can be produced in many ways. Individuals can invest in themselves by going
to college or by completing vocational training programs. Firms can invest in human capital
through on-the-job training. The government invests in human capital with programs that
improve health and that provide schooling and job training.
In the developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa, health is a major issue due to the high
incidence of HIV and other diseases. Programs to improve the health of the population increase,
among other things, the quality of the labor force, which increases output. Workers who are ill are
obviously less productive than those who are not.
In the United States, considerable resources have been put into education over the decades.
Table 32.6 shows that the level of educational attainment in the United States has risen significantly

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Education and Skills in the United Kingdom
In discussions of using education and health care to boost labor pro-
ductivity, the context is often the developing economies, where the
overall level of health and education are low. But as the article below
suggests, developed economies like the United Kingdom are also con-
cerned about the skill level of their labor force as they contemplate
their productivity and growth rates.
U.K. Businesses Press for Focus on Skills
The Wall Street Journal
The U.K. has for many years been among the world’s top
attractors of foreign investment, but was hit hard during the
financial and economic crisis. Foreign direct investment
halved in 2009 from a year earlier, according to data from
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
“The emerging markets are now able to do everything, and
are in fact surpassing us in some of their innovation and so on.
That makes the competition for U.K. businesses in particular
even more severe,” Institute of Directors Director-General
Miles Templeman said.
Boosting medium- and long-term competitiveness, which
requires a big improvement in education and skills, should be a
key electoral issue, but hasn’t really been addressed at all, he
said. “Quite frankly, the degree of business orientation in most
of the policies has not been very strong—not in the sense of
really facing up to this international competition,” he said.
While the Labour government has invested heavily in educa-
tion over the 13 years it’s been in power, businesses in the U.K.
frequently complain that many jobseekers lack basic skills.
Government data show that in 2009, 70% of British 
16-year-olds managed to gain five or more GCSE qualifica-
tions of at least a grade C, broadly regarded as a pass, up 
4.7 percentage points from a year earlier. But that still meant
that 30% of pupils reaching school-leaving age did not
achieve this basic benchmark.
“A significant part of the productivity gap with our competitors
comes down to our relatively poor skills base,” said Richard
Wainer, head of education and skills at the Confederation of
British Industry, or CBI, a major business group. “There is still a
job to do to raise our game on skills generally, particularly at an
intermediate and higher level.”

since 1940. The percentage of the population with at least 4 years of college rose from 4.6 percent in
1940 to 29.4 percent in 2008. In 1940 less than one person in four had completed high school; in
2008 86.6 percent had. This is a substantial increase in human capital. We thus have our second
answer as to why labor productivity has increased in the United States—the quality of labor has
increased through more education. As we see in the Economics in Practice above, policy makers in
many developed economies are concerned about their ability to continue to generate growth
through human capital improvements.
Increase in the Quality of Capital (Embodied 
Technical Change)
Just as workers have changed in the last one hundred years, so have machines.A present-day word
processor is quite different from the manual typewriter of the early 20th century. An increase in
the quality of a machine will increase output in the production process for the same amount of
labor used. How does an increase in the quality of capital come about? It comes about in what we
will call embodied technical change. Some technical innovation takes place, such as a faster
computer chip, which is then incorporated into machines. Usually the technical innovations are
incorporated into new machines, with older machines simply discarded when they become obso-
lete. In this case the quality of the total capital stock increases over time as more efficient new
machines replace less efficient old ones. In some cases, however, innovations are incorporated into
old machines. Commercial airplanes last for many decades, and many innovations that affect air-
planes are incorporated into existing ones. But in general, one thinks of embodied technical
change as showing up in new machines rather than existing ones.

Technical change that results in
an improvement in the quality
of capital.

642
PART VI
Further Macroeconomics Issues  
An increase in the quality of capital increases labor productivity (more output for the same
amount of labor). We thus have our third answer as to why labor productivity has increased over
time—the quality of capital has increased because of embodied technical change.
We will come back to embodied technical change, but to finish the train of thought we turn
next to disembodied technical change.
Disembodied Technical Change
In some situations we can achieve higher levels of output over time even if the quantity and quality
of labor and capital don't change. How might we do this? Perhaps we learn how to better organize
the plant floor or manage the labor force. In recent years operational improvements like lean man-
ufacturing and vendor inventory management systems have increased the ability of many manufac-
turing firms to get more output from a fixed amount and quality of labor and capital. Even
improvements in information and accounting systems or incentive systems can lead to improved
output levels. A type of technical change that is not specifically embedded in either labor or capital
but works instead to allow us to get more out of both is called disembodied technical change.
Recent experiences in the Chinese economy provide an interesting example of what might be
considered disembodied technical change broadly defined. Working at the IMF, Zuliu Hu and
Mohsin Khan have pointed to the large role of productivity gains in the 20 years following the mar-
ket reforms in China. In the period after the reforms, productivity growth rates tripled, averaging
almost 4 percent a year. Hu and Khan argue that the productivity gains came principally from the
unleashing of profit incentives that came with opening business to the private sector. Better incen-
tives produced better use of labor and capital.
Disembodied technical change can be negative. An example is environmental regulations that
require the whole production process to pollute less and thus, say, run less efficiently from a private
perspective.Another example is health and safety regulations that require the production process to
run slower to reduce injuries to workers. There is an important caveat here, however. In these exam-
ples, output will be smaller if it does not include the increased quality of air, water, health, and safety
that results from the regulations. So you can think about disembodied technical change in these
cases as being negative regarding the usual measure of output, but not necessarily a broader mea-
sure of welfare.
To the extent that disembodied technical changes are mostly positive, this is our fourth answer
as to why labor productivity has increased. People have figured out how to run production
processes and how to manage firms more efficiently.
More on Technical Change
We have seen that both embodied and disembodied technical change increase labor productivity.
It is not always easy to decide whether a particular technical innovation is embodied or disembod-
ied, and in many discussions this distinction is not made. In the rest of this section we will not
make the distinction, but just talk in general about technical innovations. The main point to keep
in mind is that technical change, regardless of how it is categorized, increases labor productivity.
The Industrial Revolution was in part sparked by new technological developments. New tech-
niques of spinning and weaving—the invention of the machines known as the mule and the spinning
jenny,for example—were critical.The high-tech boom that swept the United States in the early 1980s
was driven by the rapid development and dissemination of semiconductor technology. The high-
tech boom in the 1990s was driven by the rise of the Internet and the technology associated with it.In
India in the 1960s, new high-yielding seeds helped to create a “green revolution”in agriculture.
Technical change generally takes place in two stages.First,there is an advance in knowledge,or an
invention. However, knowledge by itself does nothing unless it is used. When new knowledge is used
to produce a new product or to produce an existing product more efficiently, there is innovation.
Given the centrality of innovation to growth, it is interesting to look at what has been happen-
ing to research in the United States over time. A commonly used measure of inputs into research is
the fraction of GDP spent. In 2007, the United States spent 2.6 percent of it GDP on R&D, down
from a high of 2.9 percent in the early 1960s. Moreover, over time, the balance of research funding
has shifted away from government toward industry. Since industry research tends to be more
applied, some observers are concerned that the United States will lose some of its edge in technol-
ogy unless more funding is provided. In 2007, the National Academies of Science argued as follows:
Although many people assume that the United States will always be a world leader in
science and technology, this may not continue to be the case inasmuch as great minds

and ideas exist throughout the world. We fear the abruptness with which a lead in sci-
ence and technology can be lost—and the difficulty of recovering a lead once lost, if
indeed it can be recovered at all.1
As we suggested earlier, the theory of convergence suggests that newly developing coun-
tries can leap forward by exploiting the technology of the developed countries. Indeed, all
countries benefit when a better way of doing things is discovered. Innovation and the diffusion
of that innovation push the production possibility frontier outward. But there is at least some
evidence that a country that leads in a discovery retains some advantage in exploiting it, at least
for some time.
What evidence do we have that the United States might be losing its edge? As a share of GDP,
the United States ranked seventh among OECD countries in 2006. If we look at patenting data,
the evidence is more encouraging: For patents simultaneously sought in the United States, Japan,
and the European Union (EU), known as triadic patents, U.S. inventors are the leading source,
having taken the lead from the EU in 1989. On the output side, then, the United States appears
still to be quite strong.
U.S. Labor Productivity: 1952 I–2010 I
Now that we have considered the various answers as to why U.S. labor productivity has increased
over time,we can return to the data and see what the actual growth has been.In Figure 22.2 on p.453,
we presented a plot of U.S. labor productivity for the 1952 I–2010 I period. This figure is repeated
in Figure 32.2 below. Remember that the line segments are drawn to smooth out the short-run
fluctuations in productivity. We saw in the last chapter that as productivity is measured, it moves
with the business cycle because firms tend to hold excess labor in recessions. We are not interested
in business cycles in this chapter, and the line segments are a way of ignoring business cycle effects.
There was much talk in the late 1970s and early 1980s about the U.S. “productivity problem.”
Some economics textbooks published in the early 1980s had entire chapters discussing the decline
in productivity that seemed to be taking place during the late 1970s. In January 1981, the
Congressional Budget Office published a report, The Productivity Problem: Alternatives for Action.
It is clear from Figure 32.2 that there was a slowdown in productivity growth in the 1970s.
The growth rate went from 3.1 percent in the 1950s and first half of the 1960s to 
2.5 percent in the last half of the 1960s and early 1970s and then to 1.4 percent from the early
1970s to the 1990s. Many explanations were offered at the time for the productivity slowdown
of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some economists pointed to the low rate of saving in the
United States compared with other parts of the world. Others blamed increased environmental

644
PART VI

and government regulation of U.S. business. Still others argued that the country was not spend-
ing as much on R&D as it should have been. Finally, some suggested that high energy costs in the
1970s led to investment designed to save energy instead of to enhance labor productivity.
Many of these factors turned around in the 1980s and 1990s and yet, as you can see from
Figure 32.2, productivity growth rose to 2.0 percent in the 1990s and through 2010. This early dis-
cussion is now quite dated. The interesting question as we move into the second decade of the
twenty-first century is whether the continued growth of the Internet and wireless devices will
return productivity growth to the values observed in the 1950s and 1960s or whether the period of
the 1950s and 1960s was simply an unusually good period for productivity growth and the United
States will continue to have productivity growth of around 2 percent.
Growth and the Environment and Issues of
Sustainability
In 2000, the United Nations unanimously adopted the Millennium Development Goals, a set of
quantifiable, time-based targets for developing countries to meet. Included in these targets, as
you might expect, were measures of education, mortality, and income growth. But the UN reso-
lution also included a set of environmental criteria. Specific criteria have been developed around
clean air, clean water, and conservation management. Table 32.10 provides the 2005 ranking of a
series of developing countries on the UN index.

2 Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger,“Economic Growth and the Environment,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, May 1995.
The inclusion of environmental considerations in the development goals speaks to the impor-
tance of environmental infrastructure in the long-run growth prospects of a country.
Environmental considerations also address some concerns that in the process of growth, environ-
mental degradation will occur. Evidence on global warming has increased some of the international
concerns about growth and the environment. The connections between the environment and
growth are complex and remain debated among economists.
The classic work on growth and the environment was done in the mid-1990s by Gene Grossman
and Alan Krueger.2 It is well known that as countries develop,they typically generate air and water pol-
lutants. China’s recent rapid growth provides a strong example of this trend. Grossman and Krueger
found, however, that as growth progresses and countries become richer, pollution tends to fall. The
relationship between growth, as measured in per-capita income, and pollution is an inverted U.
Figure 32.3 shows Grossman and Krueger’s evidence on one measure of air pollution.

CHAPTER 32
Long-Run Growth 645
How do we explain the inverted U? Clean water and clean air are what economists call normal
goods. That is, as people get richer, they want to consume more of these goods.You have already seen
in the Keynesian model that aggregate consumption increases with income. As it happens, micro-
economics finds that this relationship is true for most individual types of goods as well. Demand for
clean water and clean air turns out to increase with income levels. As countries develop, their popu-
lace increasingly demands improvements on these fronts. So while increased industrialization with
growth initially degrades the environment, in the long run environmental quality improves.
Grossman and Krueger found this inverted U in a number of countries. Economic historians
remind us that in the heyday of industrialization, northern England suffered from very serious
air pollution. Some of you may recall the description of air pollution in nineteenth-century
English novels such as Elizabeth Gaskell’s North and South.
If environmental pollution eventually declines as growth brings rising per-capita incomes,
why should we be worried? First, as Grossman and Krueger point out, the inverted U represents
historical experience, but it is not inevitable. In particular, if public opinion moves governments
and the economy at large toward technologies that reduce pollution, this requires an empowered
populace and a responsive government. Here too we see the importance of institutions in growth.
A second issue arises in cases in which high levels of current emissions produce irreversible out-
comes. Some would argue that by the time nations such as China and Vietnam develop enough to
reduce their emissions, it will be too late. Many believe that global warming is such an example.
Another important problem that has made itself known recently comes from pollution
sources that move across country boundaries. Carbon emissions associated with global warming
are one such by-product of increased industrialization. Other air pollution problems move across
national borders as well. In the heyday of industrialization by the Soviet Union, prevailing winds
blew much of the Soviet-produced pollution to Finland. Choices that countries make about lev-
els of growth and levels of environmental control affect the well-being of other countries’ popu-
lations. Nor is it easy for countries at very different levels of GDP per capita to agree on common
standards of environmental control. As we suggested earlier, demand for clean air increases with
income, when needs for food and shelter are better met. It should surprise no one who has stud-
ied economics that there are debates between developing countries and developed countries
about optimal levels of environmental control. These debates are further complicated when we
recognize the gains that consumers in developed economies reap from economic activity in the
developing world. Much of the increased carbon emitted by Chinese businesses, for example, is
associated with goods that are transported and traded to Europe and the United States. These
consumers thus share the benefits of this air pollution through the cheaper goods they consume.
Much of Southeast Asia has fueled its growth through export-led manufacturing. For countries
that have based their growth on resource extraction, there is another set of potential sustainability
issues. Many of the African nations are in this category. Nigeria relies heavily on oil; South Africa and
the Congo are large producers of diamonds and other gems.Extraction methods,of course,may carry
environmental problems. Many people also question whether growth based on extraction is econom-
ically sustainable: What happens when the oil or minerals run out? The answer is quite complicated
and depends in some measure on how the profits from the extraction process are used.Because extrac-
tion can be accomplished without a well-educated labor force, while other forms of development are
more dependent on a skilled-labor base,public investment in infrastructure is especially important.To

the extent that countries use the revenues from extraction to invest in infrastructure such as roads and
schools and to increase the education and health of their populace, the basis for growth can be shifted
over time. With weak institutions, these proceeds may be expropriated by corrupt governments or
invested outside the country, and long-run sustainable growth will not result.
The question of whether the natural resource base imposes strong natural limits on growth
has been debated since the time of Malthus. Earlier in this chapter we described the concerns of
Thomas Malthus that population growth in England would outstrip the ability of the land to
provide. In that case, technology stepped in.
In 1972, the Club of Rome, a group of “concerned citizens,” contracted with a group at MIT
to do a study entitled The Limits to Growth.3 The book-length final report presented the results of
computer simulations that assumed present growth rates of population, food, industrial output,
and resource exhaustion. According to these data, sometime after the year 2000 the limits will be
reached and the entire world economy will come crashing down:
Collapse occurs because of nonrenewable resource depletion. The industrial capital stock
grows to a level that requires an enormous input of resources. In the very process of that
growth, it depletes a large fraction of the resource reserves available.As resource prices rise
and mines are depleted, more and more capital must be used for obtaining resources, leav-
ing less to be invested for future growth. Finally, investment cannot keep up with depreci-
ation and the industrial base collapses, taking with it the service and agricultural systems,
which have become dependent on industrial inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, hospital
laboratories, computers, and especially energy for mechanization)....Population finally
decreases when the death rate is driven upward by the lack of food and health services.4
This argument is similar to one offered almost 200 years ago by Thomas Malthus, mentioned
earlier in this chapter.
In the early 1970s, many thought that the Club of Rome’s predictions had come true. It seemed
the world was starting to run up against the limits of world energy supplies. In the years since, new
reserves have been found and new sources of energy have been discovered and developed. At pre-
sent, issues of global warming and biodiversity are causing many people to question the process of
growth. How should one trade off the obvious gains from growth in terms of the lives of those in
the poorer nations against environmental goals? Recognizing the existence of these trade-offs and
trying to design policies to deal with them is one of the key tasks of policy makers.

between inputs—the labor force and the stock of capital—
and total national output.
6. A number of factors contribute to economic growth: (1) 
an increase in the labor supply, (2) an increase in physical
capital—plant and equipment, (3) an increase in the quality
of the labor supply—human capital, (4) an increase in the
quality of physical capital—embodied technical change,
and (5) disembodied technical change—for example, an
increase in managerial skills.
7. The growth rate of labor productivity in the United States
has decreased from about 3.3 percent in the 1950s and 1960s
to about 2.0 percent in the 1990s and 2000s. It was only
about 1.4 percent in the 1970s.

1. One way that less developed countries catch up with the growth
of the more developed countries is by adopting the technology
of the developed countries. On average, however, developed
countries are capital-rich and labor-short relative to the devel-
oping nations. Think of the kinds of technology that a typical
developing country with a short supply of capital and a large
marginally employed labor force would find when “shopping”
for technology in a more developed country. As a hint, the
Japanese have developed the field of robotics such as assembly
line machines. Such machines are designed to replace expensive
workers with capital (robots) in order to lower the overall cost
of production. In what ways does it help a developing country
to transfer and use a new technology in its country? What are
the costs?

3. Go to a recent issue of The Economist magazine. In the back of
each issue is a section called “economic indicators.” That section
lists the most recent growth data for a substantial number of
countries. Which countries around the world are growing most
rapidly according to the most recent data? Which countries
around the world are growing more slowly? Flip through the
stories in The Economist to see if there is any explanation for the
pattern that you observe. Write a brief essay on current general
economic conditions around the world.
4. In the fall of 2005, the president’s tax reform commission issued
a final report. The commission called for a general cut in mar-
ginal tax rates; lower tax rates on dividends, capital gains, and
interest income; and, more importantly, the expensing of invest-
ment in capital equipment. These provisions were argued to be
“pro-growth.” In what ways would you expect each of these pro-
posals to be favorable to economic growth?
5. Education is an area in which it has been hard to create pro-
ductivity gains that reduce costs. Collect data on the tuition
rates of your own college in the last twenty years and compare
that increase to the overall rate of inflation using the CPI.
What do you observe? Can you suggest some productivity-
enhancing measures?
6. Economists generally agree that high budget deficits today will
reduce the growth rate of the economy in the future. Why? Do the
reasons for the high budget deficit matter? In other words, does it
matter whether the deficit is caused by lower taxes, increased
defense spending, more job-training programs, and so on?

Throughout this book, we have
noted that there are many dis-
agreements and questions in
macroeconomics. For example,
economists disagree on whether
the aggregate supply curve is
vertical, either in the short run
or in the long run. Some econo-
mists even doubt that the aggre-
gate supply curve is a useful
macroeconomic concept. There
are different views on whether
cyclical employment exists and, if
it does, what causes it. Economists
disagree about whether monetary and fiscal policies are effective at stabilizing the economy,
and they support different views on the primary determinants of consumption and invest-
ment spending.
We discussed some of these disagreements in previous chapters, but only briefly. In this chap-
ter, we discuss in more detail a number of alternative views of how the macroeconomy works.
Keynesian Economics
John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, published in 1936,
remains one of the most important works in economics. While a great deal of the material in the
previous 10 chapters is drawn from modern research that postdates Keynes, much of the material
is built around a framework constructed by Keynes.
What exactly is Keynesian economics? In one sense, it is the foundation of all of macroeco-
nomics. Keynes was the first to emphasize aggregate demand and links between the money mar-
ket and the goods market. Keynes also emphasized the possible problem of sticky wages. In recent
years, the term Keynesian has been used more narrowly. Keynes believed in an activist federal gov-
ernment. He believed that the government had a role to play in fighting inflation and unemploy-
ment, and he believed that monetary and fiscal policy should be used to manage the
macroeconomy. This is why Keynesian is sometimes used to refer to economists who advocate
active government intervention in the macroeconomy.
During the 1970s and 1980s, it became clear that managing the macroeconomy was more
easily accomplished on paper than in practice. The inflation problems of the 1970s and early
1980s and the seriousness of the recessions of 1974–1975 and 1980–1982 led many econo-
mists to challenge the idea of active government intervention in the economy. Some of the
challenges were simple attacks on the bureaucracy’s ability to act in a timely manner. Others
were theoretical assaults that claimed to show that monetary and fiscal policies had no or lit-
tle effect on the economy.
We begin with an old debate—that between Keynesians and monetarists.

PART VI
Further Macroeconomics Issues  
Monetarism
The debate between monetarist and Keynesian economics is complicated because it means differ-
ent things to different people. If we consider the main monetarist message to be that “money
matters,” then almost all economists would agree. In the aggregate supply/aggregate demand
(AS/AD) story, for example, an increase in the money supply shifts the AD curve to the right,
which leads to an increase in both aggregate output (Y) and the price level (P). Monetary policy
thus has an effect on output and the price level. Monetarism, however, is usually considered to go
beyond the notion that money matters.
The Velocity of Money
To understand monetarist reasoning, you must understand the velocity of money. Think of
velocity as the number of times a dollar bill changes hands, on average, during a year.
Suppose on January 1 you buy a new ballpoint pen with a $5 bill. The owner of the stationery
store does not spend your $5 right away. She may hold it until, say, May 1, when she uses it to buy
a dozen doughnuts. The doughnut store owner does not spend the $5 he receives until July 1,
when he uses it (along with other cash) to buy 100 gallons of oil. The oil distributor uses the bill
to buy an engagement ring for his fiancée on September 1, but the $5 bill is not used again in the
remaining 3 months of the year. Because this $5 bill has changed hands four times during the
year, its velocity of circulation is 4. A velocity of 4 means that the $5 bill stays with each owner for
an average of 3 months, or one quarter of a year.
In practice, we use gross domestic product (GDP), instead of the total value of all transac-
tions in the economy, to measure velocity1 because GDP data are more readily available. The
income velocity of money (V) is the ratio of nominal GDP to the stock of money (M):
If $12 trillion worth of final goods and services is produced in a year and if the money stock is
$1 trillion, then the velocity of money is $12 trillion ÷ $1 trillion, or 12.0.
We can expand this definition slightly by noting that nominal income (GDP) is equal to real
output (income) (Y) times the overall price level (P):
GDP
P  Y
Through substitution:
or
M  V
P  Y
At this point, it is worth pausing to ask whether our definition has provided us with any
insights into the workings of the economy. The answer is no. Because we defined V as the ratio of
GDP to the money supply, the statement M  V
P  Y is an identity—it is true by definition.
It contains no more useful information than the statement “A bachelor is an unmarried man.”
The definition does not, for example, say anything about what will happen to P  Y when M
changes. The final value of P  Y depends on what happens to V. If V falls when M increases, the
product M  V could stay the same, in which case the change in M would have had no effect on
nominal income. To give monetarism some economic content, a simple version of monetarism
known as the quantity theory of money is used.
The Quantity Theory of Money
The key assumption of the quantity theory of money is that the velocity of money is constant (or
virtually constant) over time. If we let 
denote the constant value of V, the equation for the
quantity theory can be written as follows:
M * V = P * Y
V
K
K
V K P * Y
M
K
V K GDP

The
number of times a dollar bill
changes hands, on average,
during a year; the ratio of
nominal GDP to the stock 
of money.
1 Recall that GDP does not include transactions in intermediate goods (for example, flour sold to a baker to be made into bread)
or in existing assets (for example, the sale of a used car). If these transactions are made using money, however, they do influence
the number of times money changes hands during the course of a year. GDP is an imperfect measure of transactions to use in
calculating the velocity of money.
quantity theory of money
The theory based on the
identity M  V  P  Y and the
assumption that the velocity of
money (V) is constant (or
virtually constant).

CHAPTER 33
Alternative Views in Macroeconomics 651
Note that the double equal sign has replaced the triple equal sign because the equation is no
longer an identity. The equation is true if velocity is constant (and equal to V) but not otherwise.
If the equation is true, it provides an easy way to explain nominal GDP. Given M, which can be
considered a policy variable set by the Federal Reserve (Fed), nominal GDP is just 
In this
case, the effects of monetary policy are clear. Changes in M cause equal percentage changes in
nominal GDP. For example, if the money supply doubles, nominal GDP also doubles. If the
money supply remains unchanged, nominal GDP remains unchanged.
The key is whether the velocity of money is really constant. Early economists believed that
the velocity of money was determined largely by institutional considerations, such as how often
people are paid and how the banking system clears transactions between banks. Because these
factors change gradually, early economists believed velocity was essentially constant.
When there is equilibrium in the money market, then the quantity of money supplied is
equal to the quantity of money demanded. That could mean that M in the quantity-theory
equation equals both the quantity of money supplied and the quantity of money demanded.
If the quantity-theory equation is looked on as a demand-for-money equation, it says that
the demand for money depends on nominal income (GDP, or P  Y), but not on the interest
rate.2 If the interest rate changes and nominal income does not, the equation says that the
quantity of money demanded will not change. This is contrary to the theory of the demand
for money in Chapter 26, which had the demand for money depending on both income and
the interest rate.
Testing the Quantity Theory of Money
One way to test the validity of the quan-
tity theory of money is to look at the demand for money using recent data on the U.S. econ-
omy. The key is this: Does money demand depend on the interest rate? Most empirical work
says yes. When demand-for-money equations are estimated (or “fit to the data”), the interest
rate usually turns out to be a factor. The demand for money does not appear to depend only
on nominal income.
Another way of testing the quantity theory is to plot velocity over time and see how it
behaves. Figure 33.1 plots the velocity of money for the 1960 I–2010 I period. The data show
that velocity is far from constant. There is a long-term trend—on average, velocity has been
rising during these years—but fluctuations around this trend have also occurred and some
have been quite large. Velocity rose from 6.1 in 1980 III to 6.7 in 1981 III, fell to 6.3 in 1983 I,
rose to 6.7 in 1984 III, and fell to 5.7 in 1986 IV. Changes of a few tenths of a point may seem
small, but they are actually large. For example, the money supply in 1986 IV was $800 billion.
If velocity changes by 0.3 with a money supply of this amount and if the money supply is
unchanged, we have a change in nominal GDP (P  Y) of $240 billion (0.3  $800 billion),
which is about 5 percent of the level of GDP in 1986. The change in velocity in 2008-2009 was
remarkable. Velocity fell from 9.3 in 2008 I to 7.3 in 2009 IV!
The debate over monetarist theories is more subtle than our discussion so far indicates.
First, there are many definitions of the money supply. M1 is the money supply variable used
for the graph in Figure 33.1, but there may be some other measure of the money supply that
would lead to a smoother plot. For example, many people shifted their funds from checking
account deposits to money market accounts when the latter became available in the late
1970s. Because GDP did not change as a result of this shift while M1 decreased, velocity—the
ratio of GDP to M1—must have gone up. Suppose instead we measured the supply of money
by M2 (which includes both checking accounts and money market accounts). In this case, the
decrease in checking deposits would be exactly offset by the rise in money market account
deposits and M2 would not change. With no change in GDP and no change in M2, the veloc-
ity of money would not change. Whether or not velocity is constant may depend partly on
how we measure the money supply.
Second, there may be a time lag between a change in the money supply and its effects on
nominal GDP. Suppose we experience a 10 percent increase in the money supply today, but it
takes 1 year for nominal GDP to increase by 10 percent. If we measured the ratio of today’s
money supply to today’s GDP, it would seem that velocity had fallen by 10 percent. However, if we
measured today’s money supply against GDP 1 year from now, when the increase in the supply of
money had its full effect on income, velocity would have been constant.
M * V.
2 In terms of the Appendix to Chapter 27, this means that the LM curve is vertical.

The debate over the quantity theory of money is primarily empirical. It is a debate that can
be resolved by looking at facts about the real world and seeing whether they are in accord with the
predictions of theory. Is there a measure of the money supply and a choice of the time lag
between a change in the money supply and its effects on nominal GDP such that V is in effect
constant? If so, the monetarist theory is a useful approach to understanding how the macroecon-
omy works and how changes in the money supply will cause a proportionate increase in nominal
GDP. If not, some other theory is likely to be more appropriate. (We discuss the testing of alter-
native theories at the end of this chapter.)
Inflation as a Purely Monetary Phenomenon
So far we have talked only about nominal output (P  Y). We have said nothing about how a
monetarist would break down a change in nominal output (due to a money-supply change)
into a change in P and a change in Y. Here again it is not possible to make a general state-
ment about what all monetarists believe. Some may believe that all of the change occurs in P,
and others may believe that at least sometimes some of the change occurs in Y. If all the
change occurs in P, then there is a proportional relationship between changes in the money
supply and changes in the price level. For example, a 10 percent change in M will lead to a 
10 percent change in P if Y remains unchanged. In this case, inflation (an increase in P) is
always a purely monetary phenomenon. The price level will not change if the money supply
does not change. We call this view, that changes in M affect only P and not Y, the “strict mon-
etarist” view.
There is considerable disagreement as to whether the strict monetarist view is a good
approximation of reality. For example, the strict view is not compatible with a nonvertical 
AS curve in the AS/AD model in Chapter 28. In the case of a nonvertical AS curve, an increase in
M, which shifts the AD curve to the right, increases both P and Y. (You may want to review why.)
Almost all economists agree, however, that sustained inflation—inflation that continues over
many periods—is a purely monetary phenomenon. In the context of the AS/AD framework,
inflation cannot continue indefinitely unless the Fed “accommodates” it by increasing the money
supply. Let us review this.
Consider a continuously increasing level of government spending (G) without any corre-
sponding increase in taxes. The increases in G keep shifting the AD curve to the right, which leads
to an increasing price level (P). (You may find it useful to draw a graph now.) With a fixed money
supply, the increases in P lead to a higher and higher interest rate, but there is a limit to how far
this can go. Because taxes are unchanged, the government must finance the increases in G by issu-
ing bonds, and there is a limit to how many bonds the public is willing to hold regardless of how
high the interest rate goes. At the point at which the public cannot be induced to hold any more
bonds, the government will be unable to borrow any more to finance its expenditures. Only if the

Alternative Views in Macroeconomics 653
Fed is willing to increase the money supply (buy some of the government bonds) can the govern-
ment spending (with its inflationary consequences) continue. Inflation cannot continue indefi-
nitely without increases in the money supply.
The Keynesian/Monetarist Debate
The debate between Keynesians and monetarists was perhaps the central controversy in macro-
economics in the 1960s. The leading spokesman for monetarism was Milton Friedman from the
University of Chicago. Most monetarists, including Friedman, blamed much of the instability in
the economy on the Federal Reserve, arguing that the high inflation that the United States
encountered from time to time could have been avoided if only the Fed had not expanded the
money supply so rapidly. Monetarists were skeptical of the Fed’s ability to “manage”the economy—
to expand the money supply during bad times and contract it during good times. A common
argument against such management is the one discussed in Chapter 30: Time lags may make
attempts to stimulate and contract the economy counterproductive.
Friedman advocated instead a policy of steady and slow money growth—specifically,
that the money supply should grow at a rate equal to the average growth of real output
(income) (Y). That is, the Fed should pursue a constant policy that accommodates real
growth but not inflation.
Many Keynesians, on the other hand, advocated the application of coordinated mone-
tary and fiscal policy tools to reduce instability in the economy—to fight inflation and
unemployment. However, not all Keynesians advocated an activist federal government. Some
rejected the strict monetarist position that changes in money affect only the price level in
favor of the view that both monetary and fiscal policies make a difference. At the same time,
though, they believed that the best possible policy for the government to pursue was basi-
cally noninterventionist.
Most economists now agree, after the experience of the 1970s, that monetary and fiscal
tools are not finely calibrated. The notion that monetary and fiscal expansions and contrac-
tions can “fine-tune” the economy is gone forever. Still, many believe that the experiences of
the 1970s also show that stabilization policies can help prevent even bigger economic disas-
ters. Had the government not cut taxes and expanded the money supply in 1975 and in 1982,
they argue, the recessions of those years might have been significantly worse. The same peo-
ple would also argue that had the government not resisted the inflations of 1974–1975 and
1979–1981 with tight monetary policies, the inflations probably would have become 
much worse.
The debate between Keynesians and monetarists subsided with the advent of what we will
call “new classical macroeconomics.” Before turning to this, however, it will be useful to consider
a minor but interesting footnote in macroeconomic history: supply-side economics.
Supply-Side Economics
From our discussion of equilibrium in the goods market, beginning with the simple multiplier
in Chapter 23 and continuing through Chapter 28, we have focused primarily on demand.
Supply increases and decreases in response to changes in aggregate expenditure (which is closely
linked to aggregate demand). Fiscal policy works by influencing aggregate expenditure through
tax policy and government spending. Monetary policy works by influencing investment and
consumption spending through increases and decreases in the interest rate. The theories we
have been discussing are “demand-oriented.” Supply-side economics, as the name suggests,
focuses on the supply side.
The argument of the supply-siders about the economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s was
simple.The real problem,they said, was not demand, but high rates of taxation and heavy regulation
that reduced the incentive to work,to save,and to invest.What was needed was not a demand stimu-
lus, but better incentives to stimulate supply.
If we cut taxes so people take home more of their paychecks, the argument continued, they
will work harder and save more. If businesses get to keep more of their profits and can get away
from government regulations, they will invest more. This added labor supply and investment, or
capital supply, will lead to an expansion of the supply of goods and services, which will reduce
inflation and unemployment at the same time.

At their most extreme, supply-siders argued that the incentive effects of supply-side policies
were likely to be so great that a major cut in tax rates would actually increase tax revenues. Even
though tax rates would be lower, more people would be working and earning income and firms
would earn more profits, so that the increases in the tax bases (profits, sales, and income) would
then outweigh the decreases in rates, resulting in increased government revenues.
The Laffer Curve
Figure 33.2 presents a key diagram of supply-side economics. The tax rate is measured on the ver-
tical axis, and tax revenue is measured on the horizontal axis. The assumption behind this curve
is that there is some tax rate beyond which the supply response is large enough to lead to a
decrease in tax revenue for further increases in the tax rate. There is obviously some tax rate
between zero and 100 percent at which tax revenue is at a maximum. At a tax rate of zero, work
effort is high but there is no tax revenue. At a tax rate of 100, the labor supply is presumably zero
because people are not allowed to keep any of their income. Somewhere between zero and 100 is
the maximum-revenue rate.
The big debate in the 1980s was whether tax rates in the United States put the country on the
upper or lower part of the curve in Figure 33.2. The supply-side school claimed that the United
States was around A and that taxes should be cut. Others argued that the United States was nearer
B and that tax cuts would lead to lower tax revenue.
The diagram in Figure 33.2 is the Laffer curve, named after economist Arthur Laffer, who,
legend has it, first drew it on the back of a napkin at a cocktail party. The Laffer curve had some
influence on the passage of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, the tax package put forward
by the Reagan administration that brought with it substantial cuts in both personal and business
taxes. Individual income tax rates were cut by as much as 25 percent over 3 years. Corporate taxes
were cut sharply in a way designed to stimulate capital investment. The new law allowed firms to
depreciate their capital at a rapid rate for tax purposes, and the bigger deductions led to taxes that
were significantly lower than before.
Evaluating Supply-Side Economics
Supporters of supply-side economics claim that Reagan’s tax policies were successful in stimulat-
ing the economy. They point to the fact that almost immediately after the tax cuts of 1981 were
put into place, the economy expanded and the recession of 1980–1982 came to an end. In addi-
tion, inflation rates fell sharply from the high rates of 1980 and 1981. Except for 1 year, federal
receipts continued to rise throughout the 1980s despite the cut in tax rates.
Critics of supply-side policies do not dispute these facts, but offer an alternative explanation of
how the economy recovered. The Reagan tax cuts were enacted just as the U.S. economy was in the
middle of its deepest recession since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate stood at
10.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982. It was the recession, critics argue, that was responsible
for the reduction in inflation—not the supply-side policies.Also among the criticisms of supply-side

The Laffer curve shows that the
amount of revenue the govern-

tax rate. It shows that when tax
rates are very high, an increase in
the tax rate could cause tax rev-

same circumstances, a cut in the
tax rate could generate enough
additional economic activity to
cause revenues to rise.

CHAPTER 33
Alternative Views in Macroeconomics 655
economics is that it is unlikely a tax cut would substantially increase the supply of labor. In addi-
tion, in theory, a tax cut could even lead to a reduction in labor supply. Recall our discussion of
income and substitution effects in Chapter 31. Although it is true that a higher after-tax wage rate
provides a higher reward for each hour of work and thus more incentive to work, a tax cut also
means that households receive a higher income for a given number of hours of work. Because they
can earn the same amount of money working fewer hours, households might choose to work less.
They might spend some of their added income on leisure. Research done during the 1980s suggests
that tax cuts seem to increase the supply of labor somewhat but that the increases are very modest.
What about the recovery from the recession? Why did real output begin to grow rapidly in
late 1982, precisely when the supply-side tax cuts were taking effect? Two reasons have been sug-
gested. First, the supply-side tax cuts had large demand-side effects that stimulated the economy.
Second, the Fed pumped up the money supply and drove interest rates down at the same time the
tax cuts were being put into effect. The money supply expanded about 20 percent between 1981
and 1983, and interest rates fell. In the third quarter of 1981, the average 3-month U.S. Treasury
bill paid 15 percent interest. By the first quarter of 1983, the rate had dropped to 8.1 percent.
Certainly, traditional theory suggests that a huge tax cut will lead to an increase in disposable
income and, in turn, an increase in consumption spending (a component of aggregate expendi-
ture). In addition, although an increase in planned investment (brought about by a lower interest
rate) leads to added productive capacity and added supply in the long run, it also increases
expenditures on capital goods (new plant and equipment investment) in the short run.
Whether the recovery from the 1981–1982 recession was the result of supply-side expansion or
supply-side policies that had demand-side effects, one thing is clear: The extreme promises of the
supply-siders did not materialize. President Reagan argued that because of the effect depicted in the
Laffer curve, the government could maintain expenditures (and even increase defense expenditures
sharply), cut tax rates, and balance the budget. This was not the case. Government revenues fell
sharply from levels that would have been realized without the tax cuts. After 1982, the federal gov-
ernment ran huge deficits,with about $2 trillion added to the national debt between 1983 and 1992.
New Classical Macroeconomics
The challenge to Keynesian and related theories has come from a school sometimes referred 
to as the new classical macroeconomics.3 Like monetarism and Keynesianism, this term is vague.
No two new classical macroeconomists think exactly alike, and no single model completely repre-
sents this school. The following discussion, however, conveys the flavor of the new classical views.
The Development of New Classical Macroeconomics
A key complaint of new classical macroeconomics is the way traditional models treat expectations.
Keynes himself recognized that expectations (in the form of “animal spirits”) play a big part in eco-
nomic behavior. The problem is that traditional models assume that expectations are formed in
naive ways. A common assumption, for example, is that people form their expectations of future
inflation by assuming present inflation will continue. If they turn out to be wrong, they adjust their
expectations by some fraction of the difference between their original forecast and the actual infla-
tion rate. Suppose you expect 10 percent inflation next year. When next year comes, the inflation
rate turns out to be only 5 percent, so you have made an error of 5 percentage points. You might
then predict an inflation rate for the following year of 7.5 percent, halfway between your earlier
expectation (10 percent) and actual inflation last year (5 percent).
The problem with this treatment of expectations is that it is not consistent with the assump-
tions of microeconomics. It implies that people systematically overlook information that would
allow them to make better forecasts, even though there are costs to being wrong. If, as microeco-
nomic theory assumes, people are out to maximize their satisfaction and firms are out to maxi-
mize their profits, they should form their expectations in a smarter way. Instead of naively
3 The term new classical is used because many of the assumptions and conclusions of this group of economists resemble those of
the classical economists—that is, those who wrote before Keynes.

assuming the future will be like the past or the present, they should actively seek to forecast
the future. Any other behavior is not in keeping with the microeconomic view of the forward-
looking, rational people who compose households and firms.
Rational Expectations
In previous chapters we emphasized households’ and firms’ expectations about the future. A
firm’s decision to build a new plant depends on its expectations of future sales. The amount of
saving a household undertakes today depends on its expectations about future interest rates,
wages, and prices.
How are expectations formed? Do people assume that things will continue as they are at
present (such as predicting rain tomorrow because it is raining today)? What information do
people use to make their guesses about the future? Questions such as these have become central
to current macroeconomic thinking and research. One theory, the rational-expectations
hypothesis, offers a powerful way of thinking about expectations.
Suppose we want to forecast inflation. What does it mean to say that my expectations of
inflation are “rational”? The rational-expectations hypothesis assumes that people know the “true
model” that generates inflation—they know how inflation is determined in the economy—and
they use this model to forecast future inflation rates. If there were no random, unpredictable
events in the economy and if people knew the true model generating inflation, their forecasts of
future inflation rates would be perfect. Because it is true, the model would not permit mistakes
and thus the people using it would not make mistakes.
However, many events that affect the inflation rate are not predictable—they are random. By
“true” model, we mean a model that is, on average, correct in forecasting inflation. Sometimes
the random events have a positive effect on inflation, which means that the model underesti-
mates the inflation rate, and sometimes they have a negative effect, which means that the model
overestimates the inflation rate. On average, the model is correct. Therefore, rational expecta-
tions are correct on average even though their predictions are not exactly right all the time.
To see why, suppose you have to forecast how many times a fair coin will come up heads out
of 100 tosses. The true model in this case is that the coin has a 50/50 chance of coming up heads
on any one toss. Because the outcome of the 100 tosses is random, you cannot be sure of guess-
ing correctly. If you know the true model—that the coin is fair—your rational expectation of the
outcome of 100 tosses is 50 heads. You are not likely to be exactly right—the actual number of
heads is likely to be slightly higher or slightly lower than 50—but on average, you will be correct.
Sometimes people are said to have rational expectations if they use “all available information”in
forming their expectations. This definition is vague because it is not always clear what “all available
information” means. The definition is precise if by “all available information” we mean that people
know and use the true model. We cannot have more or better information than the true model!
If information can be obtained at no cost, people are not behaving rationally when they fail to
use all available information. Because there are usually costs to making a wrong forecast, it is not
rational to overlook information that could help improve the accuracy of a forecast as long as the
costs of acquiring that information do not outweigh the benefits of improving its accuracy.
Rational Expectations and Market Clearing
If firms have rational expectations and
if they set prices and wages on this basis, on average, prices and wages will be set at levels that
ensure equilibrium in the goods and labor markets. When a firm has rational expectations, it
knows the demand curve for its output and the supply curve of labor that it faces, except when
random shocks disrupt those curves. Therefore, on average, the firm will set the market-clearing
prices and wages. The firm knows the true model, and it will not set wages different from those it
expects will attract the number of workers it wants. If all firms behave this way, wages will be set
in such a way that the total amount of labor supplied will, on average, be equal to the total amount
of labor that firms demand. In other words, on average, there will be full employment.
In Chapter 29, we argued that there might be disequilibrium in the labor market (in the form
of either unemployment or excess demand for workers) because firms may make mistakes in
their wage-setting behavior due to expectation errors. If, on average, firms do not make errors, on
average, there will be equilibrium. When expectations are rational, disequilibrium exists only
temporarily as a result of random, unpredictable shocks—obviously an important conclusion. If

true, it means that disequilibrium in any market is only temporary because firms, on average, set
market-clearing wages and prices.
The assumption that expectations are rational radically changes the way we can view the
economy. We go from a world in which unemployment can exist for substantial periods and the
multiplier can operate to a world in which (on average) all markets clear and there is full employ-
ment. In this world, there is no need for government stabilization policies. Unemployment is not
a problem that governments need to worry about; if it exists at all, it is because of unpredictable
shocks that, on average, amount to zero. There is no more reason for the government to try to
change the outcome in the labor market than there is for it to change the outcome in the banana
market. On average, prices and wages are set at market-clearing levels.
The Lucas Supply Function
The Lucas supply function, named after Robert E. Lucas of
the University of Chicago, is an important part of a number of new classical macroeconomic the-
ories. It yields, as we shall see, a surprising policy conclusion. The function is deceptively simple.
It says that real output (Y) depends on (is a function of) the difference between the actual price
level (P) and the expected price level (Pe):
Y = f (P - Pe)
The actual price level minus the expected price level (P - Pe) is the price surprise. Before consid-
ering the policy implications of this function, we should look at the theory behind it.
Lucas begins by assuming that people and firms are specialists in production but generalists
in consumption. If someone you know is a manual laborer, the chances are that she sells only one
thing—labor. If she is a lawyer, she sells only legal services. In contrast, people buy a large bundle
of goods—ranging from gasoline to ice cream and pretzels—on a regular basis. The same is true
for firms. Most companies tend to concentrate on producing a small range of products, but they
typically buy a larger range of inputs—raw materials, labor, energy, and capital. According to
Lucas, this divergence between buying and selling creates an asymmetry. People know more
about the prices of the things they sell than they do about the prices of the things they buy.
At the beginning of each period, a firm has some expectation of the average price level for that
period. If the actual price level turns out to be different, there is a price surprise. Suppose the

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
How Are Expectations Formed?
A current debate among macroeconomists and policy makers is how
people form expectations about the future state of the economy. Of
particular interest is the formation of inflationary expectations. One
possible way that inflation can be transmitted in an economy is if indi-
viduals expect there to be inflation and then, because of these expecta-
tions, demand higher wages, leading in turn to increases in inflation.
In 2010, a number of economists began to worry about the possibility
of inflationary expectations heating up in the United States in the next
few years because of the large federal government deficit.
How are expectations in fact formed? Are expectations ratio-
nal, as some macroeconomists believe, reflecting an accurate
understanding of how the economy works? Or are they formed in
simpler, more mechanical ways? A recent research paper by
Ronnie Driver and Richard Windram from the Bank of England
sheds some light on this issue. Since 1999, the Bank of England
has done a survey four times a year of 2,000 British consumers
about their views of future inflation and future interest rates. The
surveys suggest that consumers tend to expect future inflation to
be what they perceive past inflation to have been. Also, there are
some differences between what consumers perceive past inflation
to have been and the actual estimates of past inflation made by the
government. In other words, consumers are more influenced by
their own experience than by actual government numbers and
their expectations of the future are based on their past experiences.
Consumers mostly expect the future to look the way they perceive
the past to have looked. Two factors that appear to be important in
influencing consumer perceptions of inflation are gas prices and
the attention the media pays to price increases. All this suggests
that, at least for the British consumers surveyed, the formation of
inflationary expectations is a less sophisticated process than some
economic theorists suggest. This research also suggests that to the
extent that gas prices increase and media attention to inflation
increases, inflationary expectations will increase.
CHAPTER 33
Alternative Views in Macroeconomics 657

average price level is higher than expected. Because the firm learns about the actual price level
slowly, some time goes by before it realizes that all prices have gone up. The firm does learn quickly
that the price of its output has gone up. The firm perceives—incorrectly, it turns out—that its price
has risen relative to other prices, and this perception leads it to produce more output.
A similar argument holds for workers. When there is a positive price surprise, workers at first
believe that their “price”—their wage rate—has increased relative to other prices. Workers believe
that their real wage rate has risen. We know from theory that an increase in the real wage is likely
to encourage workers to work more hours.4 The real wage has not actually risen, but it takes
workers a while to figure this out. In the meantime, they supply more hours of work than they
would have. This increase means that the economy produces more output when prices are unex-
pectedly higher than when prices are at their expected level.
This is the rationale for the Lucas supply function. Unexpected increases in the price level
can fool workers and firms into thinking that relative prices have changed, causing them to alter
the amount of labor or goods they choose to supply.
Policy Implications of the Lucas Supply Function
The Lucas supply function
in combination with the assumption that expectations are rational implies that anticipated
policy changes have no effect on real output. Consider a change in monetary policy. In gen-
eral, the change will have some effect on the average price level. If the policy change is
announced to the public, people will know the effect on the price level because they have
rational expectations (and know the way changes in monetary policy affect the price level).
This means that the change in monetary policy affects the actual price level and the expected
price level in the same way. The new price level minus the new expected price level is zero—
no price surprise. In such a case, there will be no change in real output because the Lucas
supply function states that real output can change from its fixed level only if there is a 
price surprise.
The general conclusion is that any announced policy change—in fiscal policy or any other
policy—has no effect on real output because the policy change affects both actual and expected price
levels in the same way. If people have rational expectations, known policy changes can produce no
price surprises—and no increases in real output. The only way any change in government policy can
affect real output is if it is kept in the dark so it is not generally known. Government policy can affect
real output only if it surprises people; otherwise, it cannot. Rational-expectations theory combined
with the Lucas supply function proposes a very small role for government policy in the economy.
Real Business Cycle Theory and New Keynesian Economics
Research that followed Lucas’s work was concerned with whether the existence of business
cycles can be explained under the assumptions of complete price and wage flexibility (market
clearing) and rational expectations. This work is called real business cycle theory. As we
discussed in Chapter 28, if prices and wages are completely flexible, then the AS curve is vertical,
even in the short run. If the AS curve is vertical, then events or phenomena that shift the AD
curve (such as changes in the money supply, changes in government spending, and shocks to
consumer and investor behavior) have no effect on real output. Real output does fluctuate over
time, so the puzzle is how the fluctuations can be explained if they are not due to policy changes
or other shocks that shift the AD curve. Solving this puzzle is one of the main missions of real
business cycle theory.
It is clear that if shifts of the AD curve cannot account for real output fluctuations (because
the AS curve is vertical), then shifts of the AS curve must be responsible. However, the task is to
come up with convincing explanations as to what causes these shifts and why they persist over a
number of periods. The problem is particularly difficult when it comes to the labor market. If
prices and wages are completely flexible, then there is never any unemployment aside from fric-
tional unemployment. For example, because the measured U.S. unemployment rate was 4.0 per-
cent in 2000 and 9.3 percent in 2009, the puzzle is to explain why so many more people chose not
to work in 2009 than in 2000.

4 This is true if we assume that the substitution effect dominates the income effect (see Chapter 32).

Early real business cycle theorists emphasized shocks to the production technology. Suppose
there is a negative shock in a given year that causes the marginal product of labor to decline. This
leads to a fall in the real wage, which leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor supplied. People
work less because the negative technology shock has led to a lower return from working. The
opposite happens when there is a positive shock: The marginal product of labor rises, the real
wage rises, and people choose to work more. This research was not as successful as some had
hoped because it required what seemed to be unrealistically large shocks to explain the observed
movements in labor supply over time.
What has come to be called new Keynesian economics retains the assumption of rational
expectations, but drops the assumption of completely flexible prices and wages. Prices and wages
are assumed to be sticky. The existence of menu costs is often cited as a justification of the assump-
tion of sticky prices. It may be costly for firms to change prices, which prevents firms from having
completely flexible prices. Sticky wages are discussed in Chapter 29, and some of the arguments
given there as to why wages might be sticky may be relevant to new Keynesian models.A main issue
regarding these models is that any justification has to be consistent with all agents in the model hav-
ing rational expectations.
Current research in new Keynesian economics broadly defined is vast. There are many models,
often called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. The properties of these models
vary, but most have the feature—because of the assumption of sticky prices and wages—that mone-
tary policy can affect real output.The government generally has some role to play in these models.
Evaluating the Rational Expectations Assumption
Almost all models in new classical macroeconomics—Lucas’s model, real business cycle models,
new Keynesian models—assume rational expectations. A key question concerning how realistic
these models are is thus how realistic the assumption of rational expectations is. If this assumption
approximates the way expectations are actually formed, then it calls into question any theory that
relies at least in part on expectation errors for the existence of disequilibrium. The arguments in
favor of the rational expectations assumption sound persuasive from the perspective of micro-
economic theory. When expectations are not rational, there are likely to be unexploited profit
opportunities, and most economists believe such opportunities are rare and short-lived.
The argument against rational expectations is that it requires households and firms to know
too much. This argument says that it is unrealistic to think that these basic decision-making units
know as much as they need to know to form rational expectations. People must know the true
model (or at least a good approximation of the true model) to form rational expectations, and
this knowledge is a lot to expect. Even if firms and households are capable of learning the true
model, it may be costly to take the time and gather the relevant information to learn it. The gain
from learning the true model (or a good approximation of it) may not be worth the cost. In this
sense, there may not be unexploited profit opportunities around. Gathering information and
learning economic models may be too costly to bother with, given the expected gain from
improving forecasts.
Although the assumption that expectations are rational seems consistent with the satisfac-
tion-maximizing and profit-maximizing postulates of microeconomics, the rational expectations
assumption is more extreme and demanding because it requires more information on the part of
households and firms. Consider a firm engaged in maximizing profits. In some way or other, it
forms expectations of the relevant future variables, and given these expectations, it 
figures out the best thing to do from the point of view of maximizing profits. Given a set of
expectations, the problem of maximizing profits may not be too hard. What may be hard is form-
ing accurate expectations in the first place. This requires firms to know much more about the
overall economy than they are likely to, so the assumption that their expectations are rational is
not necessarily realistic. Firms, like the rest of us—so the argument goes—grope around in a
world that is difficult to understand, trying to do their best but not always understanding enough
to avoid mistakes.
In the final analysis, the issue is empirical. Does the assumption of rational expectations
stand up well against empirical tests? This question is difficult to answer. Much work is currently
being done to answer it. There are no conclusive results yet, although the results discussed in the
Economics in Practice on p. 657 are not supportive of the rational expectations assumption.

Testing Alternative Macroeconomic Models
You may wonder why there is so much disagreement in macroeconomics. Why can’t macroecon-
omists test their models against one another and see which performs best?
One problem is that macroeconomic models differ in ways that are hard to standardize. If one
model takes the price level to be given, or not explained within the model, and another one does
not, the model with the given price level may do better in, for instance, predicting output—not
because it is a better model but simply because the errors in predicting prices have not been allowed
to affect the predictions of output.The model that takes prices as given has a head start,so to speak.
Another problem arises in the testing of the rational expectations assumption. Remember, if
people have rational expectations, they are using the true model to form their expectations.
Therefore, to test this assumption, we need the true model. There is no way to be sure that 
whatever model is taken to be the true model is in fact the true one.Any test of the rational expec-
tations hypothesis is therefore a joint test: (1) that expectations are formed rationally and (2) that
the model being used is the true one. If the test rejects the hypothesis, it may be that the model is
wrong rather than that the expectations are not rational.
Another problem for macroeconomists is the small amount of data available. Most empirical
work uses data beginning about 1950, which in 2010 was about 61 years’ (244 quarters) worth of
data. Although this may seem like a lot of data, it is not. Macroeconomic data are fairly “smooth,”
which means that a typical variable does not vary much from quarter to quarter or from year to
year. For example, the number of business cycles within this 61-year period is small, about eight.
Testing various macroeconomic hypotheses on the basis of eight business cycle observations is
not easy, and any conclusions must be interpreted with caution.
To give an example of the problem of a small number of observations, consider trying to test
the hypothesis that import prices affect domestic prices. Import prices changed very little in the
1950s and 1960s. Therefore, it would have been very difficult at the end of the 1960s to estimate
the effect of import prices on domestic prices. The variation in import prices was not great
enough to show any effects. We cannot demonstrate that changes in import prices help explain
changes in domestic prices if import prices do not change. The situation was different by the end
of the 1970s because by then, import prices had varied considerably. By the end of the 1970s,
there were good estimates of the import price effect, but not before. This kind of problem is
encountered again and again in empirical macroeconomics. In many cases, there are not enough
observations for much to be said and hence there is considerable room for disagreement.
We said in Chapter 1 that it is difficult in economics to perform controlled experiments.
Economists, are for the most part, at the mercy of the historical data. If we were able to perform
experiments, we could probably learn more about the economy in a shorter time.Alas, we must wait.
In time, the current range of disagreements in macroeconomics should be considerably narrowed.
KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS p. 649
1. In a broad sense, Keynesian economics is the foundation of
modern macroeconomics. In a narrower sense, Keynesian
refers to economists who advocate active government inter-
vention in the economy.
MONETARISM p. 650
2. The monetarist analysis of the economy places a great deal
of emphasis on the velocity of money, which is defined as the
number of times a dollar bill changes hands, on average,
during the course of a year. The velocity of money is the
ratio of nominal GDP to the stock of money, or V  GDP/M
 (P  Y)/M. Alternately, M  V  P  Y.
3. The quantity theory of money assumes that velocity is con-
stant (or virtually constant). This implies that changes in the
supply of money will lead to equal percentage changes in
nominal GDP. The quantity theory of money equation is
The equation says that demand for
money does not depend on the interest rate.
M * V = P * Y.
4. Most economists believe that sustained inflation is a purely
monetary phenomenon. Inflation cannot continue indefi-
nitely unless the Fed “accommodates” it by expanding the
money supply.
5. Most monetarists blame most of the instability in the econ-
omy on the federal government and are skeptical of the
government’s ability to manage the macroeconomy. They
argue that the money supply should grow at a rate equal to
the average growth of real output (income) (Y)—the Fed
should expand the money supply to accommodate real
growth but not inflation.
SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMICS p. 653
6. Supply-side economics focuses on incentives to stimulate
supply. Supply-side economists believe that if we lower taxes,
workers will work harder and save more and firms will invest
more and produce more. At their most extreme, supply-
siders argue that incentive effects are likely to be so great that
a major cut in taxes will actually increase tax revenues.

7. The Laffer curve shows the relationship between tax rates
and tax revenues. Supply-side economists use it to argue that
it is possible to generate higher revenues by cutting tax rates.
This does not appear to have been the case during the
Reagan administration, however, where lower tax rates
decreased tax revenues significantly and contributed to the
large increase in the federal debt during the 1980s.
NEW CLASSICAL MACROECONOMICS p. 655

expectations. The rational expectations hypothesis assumes
that people know the “true model” that generates economic
variables. For example, rational expectations assumes that
people know how inflation is determined in the economy and
use this model to forecast future inflation rates.
9. The Lucas supply function assumes that real output (Y)
depends on the actual price level minus the expected price
level, or the price surprise. This function combined with the
assumption that expectations are rational implies that antic-
ipated policy changes have no effect on real output.
10. Real business cycle theory is an attempt to explain business
cycle fluctuations under the assumptions of complete price
and wage flexibility and rational expectations. It emphasizes
shocks to technology and other shocks
11. New Keynesian economics relaxes the assumption of complete
price and wage flexibility. There is usually a role for govern-
ment policy in these models.
TESTING ALTERNATIVE MACROECONOMIC
MODELS p. 660
12. Economists disagree about which macroeconomic model is
best for several reasons: (1) Macroeconomic models differ in
ways that are hard to standardize; (2) when testing the
rational-expectations assumption, we are never sure that
whatever model is taken to be the true model is the true one;
and (3) the amount of data available is fairly small.

3. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 657] Suppose you
are thinking about where to live after you finish your degree.
You discover that an apartment building near your new job has
identical units—one is for rent and the other for sale as a con-
dominium. Given your salary, both are affordable and you like
them. Would you buy or rent? How would you go about decid-
ing? Would your expectations play a role? Be specific. Where do
you think those expectations come from? In what ways could
expectations change things in the housing market as a whole? 
4. In 2000, a well-known economist was heard to say,“The prob-
lem with supply-side economics is that when you cut taxes, they
have both supply and demand side effects and you cannot sepa-
rate the effects.” Explain this comment. Be specific and use the
1997 tax cuts or the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 as an example.
5. A cornerstone of new classical economics is the notion that expec-
tations are “rational.”What do you think will happen to the prices
of single-family homes in your community over the next several
years? On what do you base your expectations? Is your thinking
consistent with the notion of rational expectations? Explain.
6. You are a monetarist given the following information: The money
supply is $1,000. The velocity of money is 5. What is nominal
income? real income? What happens to nominal income if the
money supply is doubled? What happens to real income?
7. When Bill Clinton took office in January 1993, he faced two
major economic problems: a large federal budget deficit and
high unemployment resulting from a very slow recovery from
the recession of 1990 to 1991. In his first State of the Union
message, the president called for spending cuts and substantial
tax increases to reduce the deficit. Most of these proposed
spending cuts were in the defense budget. The following day
Alan Greenspan, chair of the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors, signaled his support for the president’s plan. Many
elements of the president’s original plan were later incorporated
into the deficit reduction bill passed in 1993.
a. Some said at the time that without the Fed’s support, the
Clinton plan would be a disaster. Explain this argument.
b. Supply-side economists and monetarists were very worried
about the plan and the support it received from the Fed.
What specific problems might a monetarist and a supply-
side economist worry about?
c. Suppose you were hired by the Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis to report on the events of 1995 and 1996. What
specific evidence would you look for to see whether the
Clinton plan was effective or whether the critics were right
to be skeptical?
8. In an economy with reasonably flexible prices and wages, full
employment is almost always maintained. Explain why that
statement is true.
9. During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan
promised to cut taxes, increase expenditures on national
defense, and balance the budget. During the New Hampshire
primary of 1980, George Bush called this policy “voodoo eco-
nomics.” The two men were arguing about the relative merits of
supply-side economics. Explain their disagreement.

THE WORLD ECONOMY
Over the last 40 years, international transactions have
become increasingly important to the U.S. economy.
In 1970, imports represented only about 7 percent of
U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). The share is now
around 15 percent. In 2010, the United States
imported about $180 billion worth of goods and
services each month. The increased trade we observe
in the United States is mirrored throughout the
world. From 1980 to 2009, world trade in real terms
grew more than sixfold. This trend has been espe-
cially rapid in the newly industrialized Asian
economies, but many developing countries such as
Malaysia and Vietnam have been increasing their
openness to trade.
The “internationalization” or “globalization”
of the U.S. economy has occurred in the private
and public sectors, in input and output markets,
and in firms and households. Once uncommon,
foreign products are now everywhere, from the
utensils we eat with to the cars we drive. Chinese
textiles and Indian software are commonplace. It
might surprise you to learn that many of the cut
flowers sold in the United States are grown in
Africa and South America. In fact, most products today are made in a number of countries. Back
in Chapter 1, we presented an Economics in Practice that described the production of Apple’s
iPod. An iPod contains 451 parts made in countries scattered around the world including Korea,
Japan, China, and the United States. The bottom of the iPod has the following information:
“Assembled in China; Designed in California.” Suzuki makes cars in Hungary and employs work-
ers from Romania and Slovakia. Honda started producing Japanese motorcycles in Ohio in 1977
with 64 employees in Marysville. The company now employs over 12,000 workers who assemble
Honda automobiles. Bose is based in the United States but has its electronic components assem-
bled in Mexico.
At the same time, the United States exports billions of dollars’ worth of agricultural goods,
aircraft, and industrial machinery. Korea imports substantial amounts of U.S. beef. In addition,
the United States exports and imports large quantities of services. When a Pakistani student
enrolls in an American college or university, or a sick woman from Chile seeks medical attention
in a U.S. hospital, or a Kenyan hires a lawyer in Miami to help him with a real estate deal, or a

The World Economy 
tourist from Indonesia eats at a restaurant in New York City, the United States is exporting a ser-
vice. Similarly, when a student from the United States takes her junior year abroad in Scotland, or
a tourist stays in a hotel in Singapore or gets a massage at a spa in Jamaica, the United States is
importing a service.
Nor are the patterns of trade that we observe in one period set in stone. Consider the case
of textiles and apparel. As recently as 2000, Mexico was the major supplier to the United States
of textiles and apparel with almost 15 percent of total U.S. imports in this category. By 2006,
China had overtaken Mexico’s lead with 29 percent of the share of U.S. textile and apparel
imports. The Dominican Republic and Honduras, which had been the fourth and fifth largest
sources of U.S. imports, respectively, had been replaced by Bangladesh and Indonesia. In
2004, for the first time, India became one of the top five exporters to the United States in this
category.
In addition to the fact that goods and services (outputs) flow easily across borders, so
too do inputs: capital and labor. Certainly, it is very easy to buy financial assets abroad.
Millions of Americans own shares in foreign stocks or have invested in bonds issued by for-
eign countries. At the same time, millions of foreigners have put money into the U.S. stock
and bond markets.
A new phenomenon, outsourcing, is also changing the nature of the global labor market. It is
now simple and very common for a customer service call to a software company from a user of its
product in Bend, Oregon, to be routed to Bangalore, India, where a young, ambitious Indian man
or woman provides assistance to a customer over the Internet. The Internet has in essence made
it possible for labor to flow smoothly across international borders.
The inextricable connection of the U.S. economy to the economies of the rest of the world
has had a profound impact on the discipline of economics and is the basis of one of its most
important insights: All economies, regardless of their size, depend to some extent on other
economies and are affected by events outside their borders.
To get you more acquainted with the international economy, this chapter discusses the eco-
nomics of international trade. First, we describe the recent tendency of the United States to
import more than it exports. Next, we explore the basic logic of trade. Why should the United
States or any other country engage in international trade? Finally, we address the controversial
issue of protectionism. Should a country provide certain industries with protection in the form
of import quotas or tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imports? Should a country help a domes-
tic industry compete in international markets by providing subsidies?
Trade Surpluses and Deficits
Until the 1970s, the United States generally exported more than it imported. When a country
exports more than it imports, it runs a trade surplus. When a country imports more than it
exports, it runs a trade deficit. Table 34.1 shows that before 1976 the United States generally ran
a trade surplus. This changed in 1976, and since 1976 the United States has run a trade deficit.
The deficit reached a local peak of $145.0 billion in 1987, fell to $27.0 billion in 1991, and then
rose dramatically to over $700 billion by 2005. By 2009, the trade deficit had fallen to just under
$400 billion, as U.S. imports declined more than U.S. exports during the recession.
The large trade deficits in the middle and late 1980s sparked political controversy that con-
tinues today. Foreign competition hit U.S. markets hard. Less expensive foreign goods—among
them steel, textiles, and automobiles—began driving U.S. manufacturers out of business, and
thousands of jobs were lost in important industries. Cities such as Pittsburgh, Youngstown, and
Detroit had major unemployment problems. In more recent times, the outsourcing of software
development to India has caused complaints from white-collar workers.
The natural reaction to trade-related job dislocation is to call for protection of U.S. indus-
tries. Many people want the president and Congress to impose taxes and import restrictions that
would make foreign goods less available and more expensive, protecting U.S. jobs. This argument
is not new. For hundreds of years, industries have petitioned governments for protection and
societies have debated the pros and cons of free and open trade. For the last century and a half,
the principal argument against protection has been the theory of comparative advantage, first
discussed in Chapter 2.

CHAPTER 34
International Trade, Comparative Advantage, and Protectionism 665
The Economic Basis for Trade: Comparative
Advantage
Perhaps the best-known debate on the issue of free trade took place in the British Parliament dur-
ing the early years of the nineteenth century. At that time, the landed gentry—the landowners—
controlled Parliament. For a number of years, imports and exports of grain had been subject to a
set of tariffs, subsidies, and restrictions collectively called the Corn Laws. Designed to discourage
imports of grain and to encourage exports, the Corn Laws’ purpose was to keep the price of food
high. The landlords’ incomes, of course, depended on the prices they got for what their land pro-
duced. The Corn Laws clearly worked to the advantage of those in power.
With the Industrial Revolution, a class of wealthy industrial capitalists emerged. The indus-
trial sector had to pay workers at least enough to live on, and a living wage depended greatly on
the price of food. Tariffs on grain imports and export subsidies that kept grain and food prices
high increased the wages that capitalists had to pay, cutting into their profits. The political battle
raged for years. However, as time went by, the power of the landowners in the House of Lords was
significantly reduced. When the conflict ended in 1848, the Corn Laws were repealed.
On the side of repeal was David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, member of Parliament,
and one of the fathers of modern economics. Ricardo’s principal work, Principles of Political
Economy and Taxation, was published in 1817, two years before he entered Parliament. Ricardo’s
theory of comparative advantage, which he used to argue against the Corn Laws, claimed that
trade enables countries to specialize in producing the products they produce best. According to the
theory specialization and free trade will benefit all trading partners (real wages will rise), even those
that may be absolutely less efficient producers. This basic argument remains at the heart of free-trade
debates even today, as policy makers argue about the effects of tariffs on agricultural development
in sub-Saharan Africa and the gains and losses from outsourcing software development to India.
The easiest way to understand the theory of comparative advantage is to examine a simple
two-person society. Suppose Bill and Colleen, stranded on a deserted island in Chapter 2, have
only two tasks to accomplish each week: gathering food to eat and cutting logs to construct a
house. If Colleen could cut more logs than Bill in a day and Bill could gather more berries and
fruits, specialization would clearly benefit both of them.
But suppose Bill is slow and clumsy and Colleen is better at cutting logs and gathering food.
Ricardo’s point is that it still pays for them to specialize. They can produce more in total by spe-
cializing than they can by sharing the work equally. We now turn to look at the application of the
powerful idea of comparative advantage to international trade.
Absolute Advantage versus Comparative Advantage
A country enjoys an absolute advantage over another country in the production of a good if it
uses fewer resources to produce that good than the other country does. Suppose country A and
country B produce wheat, but A’s climate is more suited to wheat and its labor is more produc-
tive. Country A will produce more wheat per acre than country B and use less labor in growing it
and bringing it to market. Country A enjoys an absolute advantage over country B in the produc-
tion of wheat.
A country enjoys a comparative advantage in the production of a good if that good can be
produced at lower cost in terms of other goods. Suppose countries C and D both produce wheat
and corn and C enjoys an absolute advantage in the production of both—that is, C’s climate is
better than D’s and fewer of C’s resources are needed to produce a given quantity of both wheat
and corn. Now C and D must each choose between planting land with either wheat or corn. To
produce more wheat, either country must transfer land from corn production; to produce more
corn, either country must transfer land from wheat production. The cost of wheat in each coun-
try can be measured in bushels of corn, and the cost of corn can be measured in bushels of wheat.
Suppose that in country C, a bushel of wheat has an opportunity cost of 2 bushels of corn. That
is, to produce an additional bushel of wheat, C must give up 2 bushels of corn.At the same time, pro-
ducing a bushel of wheat in country D requires the sacrifice of only 1 bushel of corn. Even though 
C has an absolute advantage in the production of both products, D enjoys a comparative advantage in
the production of wheat because the opportunity cost of producing wheat is lower in D. Under these
circumstances, Ricardo claims, D can benefit from trade if it specializes in the production of wheat.

PART VII
The World Economy 
Gains from Mutual Absolute Advantage
To illustrate Ricardo’s logic in more detail,
suppose Australia and New Zealand each have a fixed amount of land and do not trade with the
rest of the world. There are only two goods—wheat to produce bread and cotton to produce
clothing. This kind of two-country/two-good world does not exist, but its operations can be gen-
eralized to many countries and many goods.
To proceed, we have to make some assumptions about the preferences of the people living in
New Zealand and the people living in Australia. If the citizens of both countries walk around
naked, there is no need to produce cotton, so all the land can be used to produce wheat. However,
assume that people in both countries have similar preferences with respect to food and clothing:
The populations of both countries use both cotton and wheat, and preferences for food and
clothing are such that both countries consume equal amounts of wheat and cotton.
Finally, we assume that each country has only 100 acres of land for planting and that land
yields are as given in Table 34.2. New Zealand can produce 3 times the wheat that Australia can on
1 acre of land, and Australia can produce 3 times the cotton that New Zealand can in the same
space. New Zealand has an absolute advantage in the production of wheat, and Australia has an
absolute advantage in the production of cotton. In cases like this, we say the two countries have
mutual absolute advantage.
If there is no trade and each country divides its land to obtain equal units of cotton and wheat
production, each country produces 150 bushels of wheat and 150 bales of cotton. New Zealand
puts 75 acres into cotton but only 25 acres into wheat, while Australia does the reverse (Table 34.3).
TABLE 34.2 Yield per Acre of Wheat and Cotton
New Zealand
Australia
Wheat
6 bushels
2 bushels
Cotton
2 bales
6 bales
We can organize the same information in graphic form as production possibility frontiers for
each country. In Figure 34.1, which presents the positions of the two countries before trade, each
country is constrained by its own resources and productivity. If Australia put all its land into cotton,
it would produce 600 bales of cotton (100 acres  6 bales/acre) and no wheat; if it put all its land
into wheat, it would produce 200 bushels of wheat (100 acres  2 bushels/acre) and no cotton. The
opposite is true for New Zealand. Recall from Chapter 2 that a country’s production possibility
frontier represents all combinations of goods that can be produced, given the country’s resources
and state of technology. Each country must pick a point along its own production possibility curve.
When both countries have an absolute advantage in the production of one product, it is easy
to see that specialization and trade will benefit both. Australia should produce cotton, and New
Zealand should produce wheat. Transferring all land to wheat production in New Zealand yields
600 bushels, while transferring all land to cotton production in Australia yields 600 bales. An
agreement to trade 300 bushels of wheat for 300 bales of cotton would double both wheat and
cotton consumption in both countries. (Remember, before trade, both countries produced 
150 bushels of wheat and 150 bales of cotton. After trade, each country will have 300 bushels of
wheat and 300 bales of cotton to consume. Final production and trade figures are provided in
Table 34.4 and Figure 34.2.) Trade enables both countries to move beyond their previous resource
and productivity constraints.
The advantages of specialization and trade seem obvious when one country is technologi-
cally superior at producing one product and another country is technologically superior at pro-
ducing another product. However, let us turn to the case in which one country has an absolute
advantage in the production of both goods.

PART VII
The World Economy 
Gains from Comparative Advantage
Table 34.5 contains different land yield figures
for New Zealand and Australia. Now New Zealand has a considerable absolute advantage in the
production of both cotton and wheat, with 1 acre of land yielding 6 times as much wheat and
twice as much cotton as 1 acre in Australia. Ricardo would argue that specialization and trade are
still mutually beneficial.
Again, preferences imply consumption of equal units of cotton and wheat in both countries.
With no trade, New Zealand would divide its 100 available acres evenly, or 50/50, between the two
crops. The result would be 300 bales of cotton and 300 bushels of wheat. Australia would divide
its land 75/25. Table 34.6 shows that final production in Australia would be 75 bales of cotton and
75 bushels of wheat. (Remember, we are assuming that in each country, people consume equal
amounts of cotton and wheat.) Again, before any trade takes place, each country is constrained by
its own domestic production possibility curve.
Imagine we are at a meeting of trade representatives of both countries. As a special adviser,
David Ricardo is asked to demonstrate that trade can benefit both countries. He divides his
demonstration into three stages, which you can follow in Table 34.7. For Ricardo to be correct
about the gains from specialization, it must be true that moving resources around in the two
countries generates more than the 375 bushels of wheat and bales of cotton that we had before
specialization. To see how this is managed, we move in stages.

CHAPTER 34
International Trade, Comparative Advantage, and Protectionism 669
In Stage 1, let Australia move all its land into cotton production, where it is least disadvan-
taged. Australia would then produce 300 bales of cotton, as we see Stage 1 of Table 34.7. Now the
question is whether Ricardo can help us use New Zealand’s land to add at least 75 bales of cotton
to the total while producing more than the original 375 bushels of wheat. In Stage 2, Ricardo tells
New Zealand to use 25 acres to produce cotton and 75 acres for wheat production. With that allo-
cation of land, New Zealand produces 450 bushels of wheat (far more than the total produced in
the nonspecialization case by both countries) and 150 bales of cotton, leaving us with 450 bales of
cotton as well. Specialization has increased the world production of both wheat and cotton by 
75 units! With trade, which we show in Stage 3 for the case in which both countries prefer equal
consumption of the two goods, both countries can be better off than they were earlier.
Why Does Ricardo’s Plan Work?
To understand why Ricardo’s scheme works, let us
return to the definition of comparative advantage.
The real cost of producing cotton is the wheat that must be sacrificed to produce it. When we
think of cost this way, it is less costly to produce cotton in Australia than to produce it in New Zealand,
even though an acre of land produces more cotton in New Zealand. Consider the “cost” of 3 bales of
cotton in the two countries. In terms of opportunity cost, 3 bales of cotton in New Zealand cost
3 bushels of wheat; in Australia, 3 bales of cotton cost only 1 bushel of wheat. Because 3 bales are
produced by 1 acre of Australian land, to get 3 bales, an Australian must transfer 1 acre of land
from wheat to cotton production. Because an acre of land produces a bushel of wheat, losing
1 acre to cotton implies the loss of 1 bushel of wheat. Australia has a comparative advantage in
cotton production because its opportunity cost, in terms of wheat, is lower than New Zealand’s.
This is illustrated in Figure 34.3.
Conversely, New Zealand has a comparative advantage in wheat production. A unit of wheat
in New Zealand costs 1 unit of cotton, while a unit of wheat in Australia costs 3 units of cotton.
When countries specialize in producing goods in which they have a comparative advantage, they
maximize their combined output and allocate their resources more efficiently.
Terms of Trade
Ricardo might suggest a number of options for exchanging wheat and cotton to the trading part-
ners. The one we just examined benefited both partners; in percentage terms, Australia made out
slightly better. Other deals might have been more advantageous to New Zealand.
The ratio at which a country can trade domestic products for imported products is the terms of
trade.The terms of trade determine how the gains from trade are distributed among trading partners.
In the case just considered, the agreed-to terms of trade were 1 bushel of wheat for 2 bales of cotton.
Such terms of trade benefit New Zealand, which can get 2 bales of cotton for each bushel of wheat. If
it were to transfer its own land from wheat to cotton, it would get only 1 bale of cotton. The same
terms of trade benefit Australia,which can get 1 bushel of wheat for 2 bales of cotton.A direct transfer
of its own land would force it to give up 3 bales of cotton for 1 bushel of wheat.

PART VII
The World Economy 
If the terms of trade changed to 3 bales of cotton for every bushel of wheat, only New Zealand
would benefit. At those terms of trade, all the gains from trade would flow to New Zealand. Such
terms do not benefit Australia at all because the opportunity cost of producing wheat domestically
is exactly the same as the trade cost: A bushel of wheat costs 3 bales of cotton. If the terms of trade
went the other way—1 bale of cotton for each bushel of wheat—only Australia would benefit.
New Zealand gains nothing because it can already substitute cotton for wheat at that ratio. To get
a bushel of wheat domestically, however, Australia must give up 3 bales of cotton, and one-for-one
terms of trade would make wheat much less costly for Australia.
Both parties must have something to gain for trade to take place. In this case, you can see that
both Australia and New Zealand will gain when the terms of trade are set between 1:1 and 3:1,
cotton to wheat.
Exchange Rates
The examples used thus far have shown that trade can result in gains to both parties. When trade
is free—unimpeded by government-instituted barriers—patterns of trade and trade flows result
from the independent decisions of thousands of importers and exporters and millions of private
households and firms.
Private households decide whether to buy Toyotas or Chevrolets, and private firms decide
whether to buy machine tools made in the United States or machine tools made in Taiwan, raw
steel produced in Germany or raw steel produced in Pittsburgh.
But how does this trade actually come about? Before a citizen of one country can buy a prod-
uct made in another country or sold by someone in another country, a currency swap must take
place. Consider Shane, who buys a Toyota from a dealer in Boston. He pays in dollars, but the
Japanese workers who made the car receive their salaries in yen. Somewhere between the buyer of
the car and the producer, a currency exchange must be made. The regional distributor probably
takes payment in dollars and converts them into yen before remitting the proceeds to Japan.
To buy a foreign-produced good, a consumer, or an intermediary, has to buy foreign cur-
rency. The price of Shane’s Toyota in dollars depends on the price of the car stated in yen and the
dollar price of yen. You probably know the ins and outs of currency exchange very well if you
have ever traveled in another country.
In June 2010, the British pound was worth $1.48. Now suppose you are in London having din-
ner. On the menu is a nice bottle of wine for 15 pounds. How can you figure out whether you want
to buy it? You know what dollars will buy in the United States, so you have to convert the price into
dollars. Each pound will cost you $1.48, so 15 pounds will cost you $1.48  15 = $22.20.
The attractiveness of foreign goods to U.S. buyers and of U.S. goods to foreign buyers
depends in part on the exchange rate, the ratio at which two currencies are traded. In May 2008,
the British pound was worth $1.97, and that same bottle of wine would have cost $29.55.
To understand the patterns of trade that result from the actions of hundreds of thousands
of independent buyers and sellers—households and firms—we must know something about the
factors that determine exchange rates. Exchange rate determination is very complicated. Here,
however, we can demonstrate two things. First, for any pair of countries, there is a range of
exchange rates that can lead automatically to both countries’ realizing the gains from specializa-
tion and comparative advantage. Second, within that range, the exchange rate will determine
which country gains the most from trade. In short, exchange rates determine the terms of trade.
Trade and Exchange Rates in a Two-Country/Two-Good World
Consider
first a simple two-country/two-good model. Suppose both the United States and Brazil produce
only two goods—raw timber and rolled steel. Table 34.8 gives the current prices of both goods
as domestic buyers see them. In Brazil, timber is priced at 3 reals (R) per foot and steel is priced
at 4 R per meter. In the United States, timber costs $1 per foot and steel costs $2 per meter.

CHAPTER 34
International Trade, Comparative Advantage, and Protectionism 671
Suppose U.S. and Brazilian buyers have the option of buying at home or importing to meet
their needs. The options they choose will depend on the exchange rate. For the time being, we will
ignore transportation costs between countries and assume that Brazilian and U.S. products are of
equal quality.
Let us start with the assumption that the exchange rate is $1 = 1 R. From the standpoint of
U.S. buyers, neither Brazilian steel nor Brazilian timber is competitive at this exchange rate. A
dollar buys a foot of timber in the United States, but if converted into a real, it will buy only one-
third of a foot. The price of Brazilian timber to an American is $3 because it will take $3 to buy
the necessary 3 R. Similarly, $2 buys a meter of rolled steel in the United States, but the same $2
buys only half a meter of Brazilian steel. The price of Brazilian steel to an American is $4, twice
the price of domestically produced steel.
At this exchange rate, however, Brazilians find that U.S.-produced steel and timber are less
expensive than steel and timber produced in Brazil. Timber at home—Brazil—costs 3 R, but 3 R
buys $3, which buys 3 times as much timber in the United States. Similarly, steel costs 4 R at home,
but 4 R buys $4, which buys twice as much U.S.-made steel. At an exchange rate of $1 = 1 R, Brazil
will import steel and timber and the United States will import nothing.
However, now suppose the exchange rate is 1 R = $0.25. This means that 1 dollar buys 4 R. At
this exchange rate, the Brazilians buy timber and steel at home and the Americans import both
goods. At this exchange rate, Americans must pay a dollar for a foot of U.S. timber, but the same
amount of timber can be had in Brazil for the equivalent of $0.75. (Because 1 R costs $0.25, 3 R
can be purchased for $0.75.) Similarly, steel that costs $2 per meter in the United States costs an
American half as much in Brazil because $2 buys 8 R, which buys 2 meters of Brazilian steel. At
the same time, Brazilians are not interested in importing because both goods are cheaper when
purchased from a Brazilian producer. In this case, the United States imports both goods and
Brazil imports nothing.
So far we can see that at exchange rates of $1 = 1 R and $1 = 4 R, we get trade flowing in only
one direction. Let us now try an exchange rate of $1 = 2 R, or 1 R = $0.50. First, Brazilians will
buy timber in the United States. Brazilian timber costs 3 R per foot, but 3 R buys $1.50, which is
enough to buy 1.5 feet of U.S. timber. Buyers in the United States will find Brazilian timber too
expensive, but Brazil will import timber from the United States. At this same exchange rate, how-
ever, both Brazilian and U.S. buyers will be indifferent between Brazilian and U.S. steel. To U.S.
buyers, domestically produced steel costs $2. Because $2 buys 4 R, a meter of imported Brazilian
steel also costs $2. Brazilian buyers also find that steel costs 4 R, whether domestically produced
or imported. Thus, there is likely to be no trade in steel.
What happens if the exchange rate changes so that $1 buys 2.1 R? While U.S. timber is still
cheaper to both Brazilians and Americans, Brazilian steel begins to look good to U.S. buyers. Steel
produced in the United States costs $2 per meter, but $2 buys 4.2 R, which buys more than a
meter of steel in Brazil. When $1 buys more than 2 R, trade begins to flow in both directions:
Brazil will import timber, and the United States will import steel.
If you examine Table 34.9 carefully, you will see that trade flows in both directions as long as
the exchange rate settles between $1 = 2 R and $1 = 3 R. Stated the other way around, trade will
flow in both directions if the price of a real is between $0.33 and $0.50.

PART VII
The World Economy 
begin buying all their steel in Brazil. The U.S. steel industry finds itself in trouble. Plants close,
and U.S. workers begin to lobby for tariff protection against Brazilian steel. At the same time, the
U.S. timber industry does well, fueled by strong export demand from Brazil. The timber-producing
sector expands. Resources, including capital and labor, are attracted into timber production.
The opposite occurs in Brazil. The Brazilian timber industry suffers losses as export demand
dries up and Brazilians turn to cheaper U.S. imports. In Brazil, lumber companies turn to the
government and ask for protection from cheap U.S. timber. However, steel producers in Brazil are
happy. They are not only supplying 100 percent of the domestically demanded steel but also sell-
ing to U.S. buyers. The steel industry expands, and the timber industry contracts. Resources,
including labor, flow into steel.
With this expansion-and-contraction scenario in mind, let us look again at our original def-
inition of comparative advantage. If we assume that prices reflect resource use and resources can
be transferred from sector to sector, we can calculate the opportunity cost of steel/timber in both
countries. In the United States, the production of a meter of rolled steel consumes twice the
resources that the production of a foot of timber consumes. Assuming that resources can be
transferred, the opportunity cost of a meter of steel is 2 feet of timber (Table 34.8). In Brazil, a
meter of steel uses resources costing 4 R, while a unit of timber costs 3 R. To produce a meter of
steel means the sacrifice of only four-thirds (or one and one-third) feet of timber. Because the
opportunity cost of a meter of steel (in terms of timber) is lower in Brazil, we say that Brazil has
a comparative advantage in steel production.
Conversely, consider the opportunity cost of timber in the two countries. Increasing
timber production in the United States requires the sacrifice of half a meter of steel for every
foot of timber—producing a meter of steel uses $2 worth of resources, while producing a
foot of timber requires only $1 worth of resources. Nevertheless, each foot of timber pro-
duction in Brazil requires the sacrifice of three-fourths of a meter of steel. Because the
opportunity cost of timber is lower in the United States, the United States has a comparative
advantage in the production of timber. If exchange rates end up in the right ranges, the free
market will drive each country to shift resources into those sectors in which it enjoys a com-
parative advantage. Only in a country with a comparative advantage will those products be
competitive in world markets.
The Sources of Comparative Advantage
Specialization and trade can benefit all trading partners, even those that may be inefficient pro-
ducers in an absolute sense. If markets are competitive and if foreign exchange markets are linked
to goods-and-services exchange, countries will specialize in producing products in which they
have a comparative advantage.
So far, we have said nothing about the sources of comparative advantage. What determines
whether a country has a comparative advantage in heavy manufacturing or in agriculture? What
explains the actual trade flows observed around the world? Various theories and empirical work on
international trade have provided some answers. Most economists look to factor endowments—
the quantity and quality of labor, land, and natural resources of a country—as the principal
sources of comparative advantage. Factor endowments seem to explain a significant portion of
actual world trade patterns.
The Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem
Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin, two Swedish economists who wrote in the first half of the twenti-
eth century, expanded and elaborated on Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. The
Heckscher-Ohlin theorem ties the theory of comparative advantage to factor endowments. It
assumes that products can be produced using differing proportions of inputs and that inputs are
mobile between sectors in each economy but that factors are not mobile between economies.
According to this theorem, a country has a comparative advantage in the production of a product if
that country is relatively well endowed with inputs used intensively in the production of that product.

CHAPTER 34
International Trade, Comparative Advantage, and Protectionism 673
This idea is simple. A country with a great deal of good fertile land is likely to have a compar-
ative advantage in agriculture. A country with a large amount of accumulated capital is likely to
have a comparative advantage in heavy manufacturing. A country well-endowed with human
capital is likely to have a comparative advantage in highly technical goods.
Other Explanations for Observed Trade Flows
Comparative advantage is not the only reason countries trade. It does not explain why many
countries import and export the same kinds of goods. The United States, for example, exports
and imports automobiles.
Just as industries within a country differentiate their products to capture a domestic mar-
ket, they also differentiate their products to please the wide variety of tastes that exists world-
wide. The Japanese automobile industry, for example, began producing small, fuel-efficient cars
long before U.S. automobile makers did. In doing so, the Japanese auto industry developed
expertise in creating products that attracted a devoted following and considerable brand loy-
alty. BMWs, made mostly in Germany, and Volvos, made mostly in Sweden, also have their
champions in many countries. Just as product differentiation is a natural response to diverse
preferences within an economy, it is also a natural response to diverse preferences across
economies. Paul Krugman did some of the earliest work in this area, sometimes called New
Trade Theory.
New trade theory also relies on the idea of comparative advantage. If the Japanese developed
skills and knowledge that gave them an edge in the production of fuel-efficient cars, that knowl-
edge can be thought of as a very specific kind of capital that is not currently available to other
producers. The Volvo company invested in a form of intangible capital called goodwill. That
goodwill, which may come from establishing a reputation for safety and quality over the years, is
one source of the comparative advantage that keeps Volvos selling on the international market.
Some economists distinguish between gains from acquired comparative advantages and gains
from natural comparative advantages.
Trade Barriers: Tariffs, Export Subsidies,
and Quotas
Trade barriers—also called obstacles to trade—take many forms. The three most common are tar-
iffs, export subsidies, and quotas. All are forms of protection shielding some sector of the econ-
omy from foreign competition.
A tariff is a tax on imports. The average tariff on imports into the United States is less than 
5 percent. Certain protected items have much higher tariffs. For example, in 2009 President
Obama imposed a tariff of 35 percent on tire imports from China.
Export subsidies—government payments made to domestic firms to encourage exports—
can also act as a barrier to trade. One of the provisions of the Corn Laws that stimulated Ricardo’s
musings was an export subsidy automatically paid to farmers by the British government when the
price of grain fell below a specified level. The subsidy served to keep domestic prices high, but it
flooded the world market with cheap subsidized grain. Foreign farmers who were not subsidized
were driven out of the international marketplace by the artificially low prices.
Farm subsidies remain a part of the international trade landscape today. Many countries
continue to appease their farmers by heavily subsidizing exports of agricultural products. The
political power of the farm lobby in many countries has had an important effect on recent inter-
national trade negotiations aimed at reducing trade barriers. The prevalence of farm subsidies
in the developed world has become a major rallying point for less developed countries as they
strive to compete in the global marketplace. Many African nations, in particular, have a compar-
ative advantage in agricultural land. In producing agricultural goods for export to the world
marketplace, however, they must compete with food produced on heavily subsidized farms in
Europe and the United States. Countries such as France have particularly high farm subsidies,

The World Economy 
which, it argues, helps preserve the rural heritage of France. One side effect of these subsidies,
however, is to make it more difficult for some of the poorer nations in the world to compete.
Some have argued that if developed nations eliminated their farm subsidies, this would have a
much larger effect on the economies of some African nations than is currently achieved by char-
itable aid programs.
Closely related to subsidies is dumping. Dumping occurs when a firm or industry sells its
products on the world market at prices lower than its cost of production. Charges of dumping are
often brought by a domestic producer that believes itself to be subject to unfair competition. In
the United States, claims of dumping are brought before the International Trade Commission. In
2007, for example, a small manufacturer of thermal paper charged China and Germany with
dumping. In 2006, the European Union charged China with dumping shoes. In 2009, China
brought a dumping charge against U.S. chicken producers. Determining whether dumping has
actually occurred can be difficult. Domestic producers argue that foreign firms will dump their
product in the United States, drive out American competitors, and then raise prices, thus harm-
ing consumers. Foreign exporters, on the other hand, claim that their prices are low simply
because their costs are low and that no dumping has occurred. Figuring out the costs for German
thermal paper or Chinese shoes is not easy. In the case of the Chinese shoe claim, for example, the
Chinese government pointed out that shoes are a very labor-intensive product and that given
China’s low wages, it should not be a surprise that it is able to produce shoes very cheaply. In
other words, the Chinese claim that shoes are an example of the theory of comparative advantage
at work rather than predatory dumping.
A quota is a limit on the quantity of imports. Quotas can be mandatory or voluntary, and
they may be legislated or negotiated with foreign governments. The best-known voluntary quota,
or “voluntary restraint,” was negotiated with the Japanese government in 1981. Japan agreed to
reduce its automobile exports to the United States by 7.7 percent, from the 1980 level of 1.82 mil-
lion units to 1.68 million units. Many quotas limit trade around the world today. Perhaps the
best-known recent case is the textile quota imposed in August 2005 by the European Union on
imports of textiles from China. Because China had exceeded quotas that had been agreed to ear-
lier in the year, the EU blocked the entry of Chinese-produced textiles into Europe; as a result,
more than 100 million garments piled up in European ports.
U.S. Trade Policies, GATT, and the WTO
The United States has been a high-tariff nation, with average tariffs of over 50 percent, for much
of its history. The highest were in effect during the Great Depression following the Smoot-
Hawley tariff, which pushed the average tariff rate to 60 percent in 1930. The Smoot-Hawley tar-
iff set off an international trade war when U.S. trading partners retaliated with tariffs of their
own. Many economists say the decline in trade that followed was one of the causes of the world-
wide depression of the 1930s.1
In 1947, the United States, with 22 other nations, agreed to reduce barriers to trade. It also
established an organization to promote liberalization of foreign trade. The General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) proved to be very successful in helping reduce tariff levels and encour-
age trade. In 1986, GATT sponsored a round of world trade talks known as the Uruguay Round that
were focused on reducing trade barriers further.After much debate, the Uruguay Round was signed
by the U.S. Congress in 1993 and became a model for multilateral trade agreements.
In 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established as a negotiating forum to
deal with the rules of trade established under GATT and other agreements. It remains the key
institution focused on facilitating freer trade across nations and negotiating trade disputes. The
WTO consists of 153 member nations and serves as a negotiating forum for countries as they
work through complexities of trade under the Uruguay Round and other agreements. At this
time, the WTO is the central institution for promoting and facilitating free trade.
While the WTO was founded to promote free trade, its member countries clearly have different
incentives as they confront trade cases. In recent years, differences between developed and develop-
ing countries have come to the fore. In 2001, at a WTO meeting in Doha, Qatar, the WTO launched
a new initiative, the Doha Development Agenda, to deal with some of the issues that intersect the
areas of trade and development. In 2007, the Doha Development Agenda continued to struggle over

CHAPTER 34
International Trade, Comparative Advantage, and Protectionism 675
the issue of agriculture and farm subsidies that were described earlier in this chapter. The less devel-
oped countries, with sub-Saharan Africa taking the lead, seek to eliminate all farm subsidies cur-
rently paid by the United States and the European Union. The EU has, for its part, tried to push the
less developed countries toward better environmental policies as part of a broader free trade pack-
age. As of 2010, the Doha declaration remained stalled.
The movement in the United States has been away from tariffs and quotas and toward freer trade.
The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the president to negotiate trade agreements
on behalf of the United States. As part of trade negotiations, the president can confer most-favored-
nation status on individual trading partners.Imports from countries with most-favored-nation status
are taxed at the lowest negotiated tariff rates. In addition, in recent years, several successful rounds of
tariff-reduction negotiations have reduced trade barriers to their lowest levels ever.
Despite this general trend toward freer trade, most American presidents in the last 50 years
have made exceptions to protect one economic sector or another. Eisenhower and Kennedy
restricted imports of Japanese textiles; Johnson restricted meat imports to protect Texas beef pro-
ducers; Nixon restricted steel imports; Reagan restricted automobiles from Japan. In early 2002,
President George W. Bush imposed a 30 percent tariff on steel imported from the EU. In 2003, the
WTO ruled that these tariffs were unfair and allowed the EU to slap retaliatory tariffs on U.S.
products. Shortly thereafter, the steel tariffs were rolled back, at least on EU steel. At present, the
United States has high tariffs on sugar-based ethanol, an energy source competitive with corn-
based ethanol, and on tires imported from China.
Economic Integration
Economic integration occurs when two or more nations join to
form a free-trade zone. In 1991, the European Community (EC, or the Common Market)
began forming the largest free-trade zone in the world. The economic integration process
began that December, when the 12 original members (the United Kingdom, Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Spain, and
Portugal) signed the Maastricht Treaty. The treaty called for the end of border controls, a
common currency, an end to all tariffs, and the coordination of monetary and political affairs.
The European Union (EU), as the EC is now called, has 27 members (for a list, see 
the Summary, p. 683). On January 1, 1993, all tariffs and trade barriers were dropped among
the member countries. Border checkpoints were closed in early 1995. Citizens can now travel
among member countries without passports.
The United States is not a part of the EU. However, in 1988, the United States (under
President Reagan) and Canada (under Prime Minister Mulroney) signed the U.S.-Canadian
Free Trade Agreement, which removed all barriers to trade, including tariffs and quotas,
between the two countries in 1998.
During the last days of the George H. W. Bush administration in 1992, the United States,
Mexico, and Canada signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with the
three countries agreeing to establish all of North America as a free-trade zone. The agreement
eliminated all tariffs over a 10- to 15-year period and removed restrictions on most investments.
During the presidential campaign of 1992, NAFTA was hotly debated. Both Bill Clinton and
George Bush supported the agreement. Industrial labor unions that might be affected by increased
imports from Mexico (such as those in the automobile industry) opposed the agreement, while
industries whose exports to Mexico might increase as a result of the agreement—for example, the
machine tool industry—supported it. Another concern was that Mexican companies were not
subject to the same environmental regulations as U.S. firms, so U.S. firms might move to Mexico
for this reason.
NAFTA was ratified by the U.S. Congress in late 1993 and went into effect on the first day of
1994. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimated that as a result of NAFTA, trade between
the United States and Mexico increased by nearly $16 billion in 1994. In addition, exports from
the United States to Mexico outpaced imports from Mexico during 1994. In 1995, however, the
agreement fell under the shadow of a dramatic collapse of the value of the peso. U.S. exports to
Mexico dropped sharply, and the United States shifted from a trade surplus to a large trade
deficit with Mexico. Aside from a handful of tariffs, however, all of NAFTA’s commitments were
fully implemented by 2003, and an 8-year report signed by all three countries declared the pact
a success. The report concludes, “Eight years of expanded trade, increased employment and
investment, and enhanced opportunity for the citizens of all three countries have demonstrated
that NAFTA works and will continue to work.” In 2007, trade among the NAFTA nations
reached $930 billion.

PART VII
The World Economy 
Free Trade or Protection?
One of the great economic debates of all time revolves around the free-trade-versus-protection
controversy. We briefly summarize the arguments in favor of each.
The Case for Free Trade
In one sense, the theory of comparative advantage is the case for free trade. Trade has potential
benefits for all nations. A good is not imported unless its net price to buyers is below the net price
of the domestically produced alternative. When the Brazilians in our earlier example found U.S.
timber less expensive than their own, they bought it, yet they continued to pay the same price for
homemade steel. Americans bought less expensive Brazilian steel, but they continued to buy
domestic timber at the same lower price. Under these conditions, both Americans and Brazilians
ended up paying less and consuming more.
At the same time, resources (including labor) move out of steel production and into timber
production in the United States. In Brazil, resources (including labor) move out of timber 
production and into steel production. The resources in both countries are used more efficiently.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Tariff Wars
In the recent recession we have again seen political pressure
aimed at imposing tariffs. These pressures have been especially
strong in the case of China, whose export growth to the United
States and the EU has been very strong. In the case of the EU’s
tariff on Chinese shoes, pressure from Italian shoemakers played
a substantial role.
China Complains to WTO About EU Tariffs
The Wall Street Journal
China filed a complaint against European Union shoe tariffs at
the World Trade Organization on Thursday, as Beijing continued
its legal assault on what it says is unfair Western protectionism.
China’s exports have been growing since the 1990s, par-
ticularly after the country joined the WTO in 2001. Eight years
later, China passed Germany to become the world’s top
exporter. That status comes with a price: China is now the
leading target for protectionist measures, according to Global
Trade Alert, an independent monitor.
As the fitful economic recovery has put some domestic
jobs and profits at risk, the EU and the U.S. have sought to
stem the flow of Chinese imports with special duties. Added
to existing tariffs, the duties are meant to make Chinese
goods too expensive for consumers to afford.
China isn’t taking the restrictions lying down. From a new
office near WTO headquarters in Geneva, Beijing is playing
hardball. It is paying top dollar to engage premium counsel,
some trade lawyers say.
In September, China reacted to President Barack Obama’s
tariffs on tire imports with a complaint against the U.S. China has
also put restrictions on imports of U.S. poultry and auto parts.
Early Friday, China’s Commerce Ministry said it had
made a preliminary decision to impose antidumping duties
on some U.S. chicken products from Feb. 13, the eve of the
Lunar New Year, China’s biggest holiday. Companies
named in the statement include Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson
Foods Inc. 
In the EU case, China is taking on one of the most impor-
tant tariff increases ever levied, which has taken a bite out of
its expansive shoe industry. The 16.5% tariffs are antidumping
duties, meant to punish goods that are sold below cost and
hurt the sales of domestic producers.
The EU duties were inaugurated in 2006 and extended for
15 months in December 2009. At the same time, shoe
imports from Vietnam were hit with a 10% tariff. 
The EU tariffs were passed after fierce lobbying by Italy on
behalf of its domestic shoemakers. Italy traded votes in other
debates with EU members in exchange for support for the
tariffs, EU officials say.

CHAPTER 34
International Trade, Comparative Advantage, and Protectionism 677
Tariffs, export subsidies, and quotas, which interfere with the free movement of goods and ser-
vices around the world, reduce or eliminate the gains of comparative advantage.
We can use supply and demand curves to illustrate this. Suppose Figure 34.4 shows domestic
supply and demand for textiles. In the absence of trade, the market clears at a price of $4.20. At
equilibrium, 450 million yards of textiles are produced and consumed.
Assume now that textiles are available at a world price of $2. This is the price in dollars
that Americans must pay for textiles from foreign sources. If we assume that an unlimited
quantity of textiles is available at $2 and there is no difference in quality between domestic and
foreign textiles, no domestic producer will be able to charge more than $2. In the absence of
trade barriers, the world price sets the price in the United States. As the price in the United
States falls from $4.20 to $2.00, the quantity demanded by consumers increases from 450 mil-
lion yards to 700 million yards, but the quantity supplied by domestic producers drops from
450 million yards to 200 million yards. The difference, 500 million yards, is the quantity of tex-
tiles imported.
The argument for free trade is that each country should specialize in producing the goods
and services in which it enjoys a comparative advantage. If foreign producers can produce tex-
tiles at a much lower price than domestic producers, they have a comparative advantage. As the
world price of textiles falls to $2, domestic (U.S.) quantity supplied drops and resources are
transferred to other sectors. These other sectors, which may be export industries or domestic
industries, are not shown in Figure 34.4a. It is clear that the allocation of resources is more effi-
cient at a price of $2. Why should the United States use domestic resources to produce what for-
eign producers can produce at a lower cost? U.S. resources should move into the production of
the things it produces best.
Now consider what happens to the domestic price of textiles when a trade barrier is imposed.
Figure 34.4b shows the effect of a set tariff of $1 per yard imposed on imported textiles. The tariff
raises the domestic price of textiles to $2 + $1 = $3. The result is that some of the gains from trade
are lost. First, consumers are forced to pay a higher price for the same good. The quantity of

 FIGURE 34.4 The Gains from Trade and Losses from the Imposition of a Tariff
A tariff of $1 increases the market price facing consumers from $2 per yard to $3 per yard. The govern-
ment collects revenues equal to the gray shaded area in b. The loss of efficiency has two components.
First, consumers must pay a higher price for goods that could be produced at lower cost. Second, mar-
ginal producers are drawn into textiles and away from other goods, resulting in inefficient domestic pro-
duction. The triangle labeled ABC in b is the dead weight loss or excess burden resulting from 
the tariff. 

678
PART VII
The World Economy 
textiles demanded drops from 700 million yards under free trade to 600 million yards
because some consumers are not willing to pay the higher price. Notice in Figure 34.4b the
triangle labeled ABC. This is the deadweight loss or excess burden resulting from the tariff.
Absent the tariff, these 100 added units of textiles would have generated benefits in excess of
the $2 that each one cost.
At the same time, the higher price of textiles draws some marginal domestic producers
who could not make a profit at $2 into textile production. (Recall that domestic producers do
not pay a tariff.) As the price rises to $3, the quantity supplied by domestic producers rises
from 200 million yards to 300 million yards. The result is a decrease in imports from 500 mil-
lion yards to 300 million yards.
Finally, the imposition of the tariff means that the government collects revenue equal to
the shaded area in Figure 34.4b. This shaded area is equal to the tariff rate per unit ($1) times
the number of units imported after the tariff is in place (300 million yards). Thus, receipts
from the tariff are $300 million.
What is the final result of the tariff? Domestic producers receiving revenues of only $2 per
unit before the tariff was imposed now receive a higher price and earn higher profits. However,
these higher profits are achieved at a loss of efficiency. Trade barriers prevent a nation from reap-
ing the benefits of specialization, push it to adopt relatively inefficient production techniques, and
force consumers to pay higher prices for protected products than they would otherwise pay.
The Case for Protection
A case can also be made in favor of tariffs and quotas. Over the course of U.S. history, protection-
ist arguments have been made so many times by so many industries before so many congressional
committees that it seems all pleas for protection share the same themes. We describe the most fre-
quently heard pleas next.
Protection Saves Jobs
The main argument for protection is that foreign competition
costs Americans their jobs. When Americans buy imported Toyotas, U.S. produced cars go
unsold. Layoffs in the domestic auto industry follow. When Americans buy Chinese textiles,
American workers may lose their jobs. When Americans buy shoes or textiles from Korea or
Taiwan, the millworkers in Maine and Massachusetts, as well as in South Carolina and Georgia,
lose their jobs.
It is true that when we buy goods from foreign producers, domestic producers suffer.
However, there is no reason to believe that the workers laid off in the contracting sectors will not
ultimately be reemployed in expanding sectors. Foreign competition in textiles, for example, has
meant the loss of U.S. jobs in that industry. Thousands of textile workers in New England lost
their jobs as the textile mills closed over the last 40 years. Nevertheless, with the expansion of
high-tech industries, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts fell to one of the lowest in the
country in the mid-1980s, and New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine also boomed. By the
1990s, New England had suffered another severe downturn, due partly to high-technology hard-
ware manufacturing that had moved abroad. But by the late 1990s, its economy was booming
again, this time on the back of what was called a “New Industrial Revolution”: the rise of
Internet-based business.
The adjustment is far from costless. The knowledge that some other industry, perhaps in
some other part of the country, may be expanding is of little comfort to the person whose
skills become obsolete or whose pension benefits are lost when his or her company abruptly
closes a plant or goes bankrupt. The social and personal problems brought about by
industry-specific unemployment, obsolete skills, and bankruptcy as a result of foreign com-
petition are significant.
These problems can be addressed in two ways. We can ban imports and give up the gains
from free trade, acknowledging that we are willing to pay premium prices to save domestic jobs in
industries that can produce more efficiently abroad, or we can aid the victims of free trade in a
constructive way, helping to retrain them for jobs with a future. In some instances, programs to
relocate people in expanding regions may be in order. Some programs deal directly with the tran-
sition without forgoing the gains from trade.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
A Petition
While most economists argue in favor of free trade, it is important to
recognize that some groups are likely to lose from freer trade.
Arguments by the losing groups against trade have been around for
hundreds of years. In the following article, you will find an essay by
a French satirist of the nineteenth century, Frederic Bastiat,
complaining about the unfair competition that the sun provides to
candle makers. You see that the author proposes a quota, as opposed
to a tariff, on the sun.
From the Manufacturers of Candles, Tapers, Lanterns, Sticks,
Street Lamps, Snuffers, and Extinguishers, and from Producers
of Tallow, Oil, Resin, Alcohol, and Generally of Everything
Connected with Lighting.
To the Honourable Members of the Chamber of Deputies.
Gentlemen:
You are on the right track. You reject abstract theories and
[have] little regard for abundance and low prices. You concern
yourselves mainly with the fate of the producer. You wish to
free him from foreign competition, that is, to reserve the
domestic market for domestic industry.
We come to offer you a wonderful opportunity for your—
what shall we call it? Your theory? No, nothing is more decep-
tive than theory. Your doctrine? Your system? Your principle?
But you dislike doctrines, you have a horror of systems, as for
principles, you deny that there are any in political economy;
therefore we shall call it your practice—your practice without
theory and without principle.
We are suffering from the ruinous competition of a rival who
apparently works under conditions so far superior to our own
for the production of light that he is flooding the domestic
market with it at an incredibly low price; for the moment he
appears, our sales cease, all the consumers turn to him, and a
branch of French industry whose ramifications are innumerable
is all at once reduced to complete stagnation. This rival, which
is none other than the sun, is waging war on us so mercilessly
we suspect he is being stirred up against us by perfidious
Albion (excellent diplomacy nowadays!), particularly because
he has for that haughty island a respect that he does not show
for us. [A reference to Britain’s reputation as a foggy island.]
We ask you to be so good as to pass a law requiring the
closing of all windows, dormers, skylights, inside and outside
shutters, curtains, casements, bull’s-eyes, deadlights, and
blinds—in short, all openings, holes, chinks, and fissures
through which the light of the sun is wont to enter houses, to
the detriment of the fair industries with which, we are proud
to say, we have endowed the country, a country that cannot,
without betraying ingratitude, abandon us today to so
unequal a combat.
Source: An Open Letter to the French Parliament by Frederic Bastiat
(1801–1850), originally published in 1845.
Screening out the sun would increase the demand for candles. Should
candlemakers be protected from unfair competition?
Some Countries Engage in Unfair Trade Practices
Attempts by U.S. firms to
monopolize an industry are illegal under the Sherman and Clayton acts. If a strong company
decides to drive the competition out of the market by setting prices below cost, it would be
aggressively prosecuted by the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. However, the argu-
ment goes, if we will not allow a U.S. firm to engage in predatory pricing or monopolize an indus-
try or a market, can we stand by and let a German firm or a Japanese firm do so in the name of
free trade? This is a legitimate argument and one that has gained significant favor in recent years.
How should we respond when a large international company or a country behaves strategically
against a domestic firm or industry? Free trade may be the best solution when everybody plays by
the rules, but sometimes we have to fight back. The WTO is the vehicle currently used to negoti-
ate disputes of this sort.

PART VII
The World Economy 
2 Werner Antweiler, Brian Copeland, and M. Scott Taylor,“Is Free Trade Good for the Environment?” AER, September, 2001.
Cheap Foreign Labor Makes Competition Unfair
Let us say that a particular
country gained its “comparative advantage” in textiles by paying its workers low wages. How can
U.S. textile companies compete with companies that pay wages that are less than a quarter of
what U.S. companies pay? Questions like this are often asked by those concerned with competi-
tion from China and India.
First, remember that wages in a competitive economy reflect productivity: a high ratio of
output to units of labor. Workers in the United States earn higher wages because they are more
productive. The United States has more capital per worker; that is, the average worker works with
better machinery and equipment and its workers are better trained. Second, trade flows not
according to absolute advantage, but according to comparative advantage: All countries benefit,
even if one country is more efficient at producing everything.
Protection Safeguards National Security
Beyond saving jobs, certain sectors of
the economy may appeal for protection for other reasons. The steel industry has argued for
years with some success that it is vital to national defense. In the event of a war, the United
States would not want to depend on foreign countries for a product as vital as steel. Even if we
acknowledge another country’s comparative advantage, we may want to protect our own
resources.
Virtually no industry has ever asked for protection without invoking the national defense
argument. Testimony that was once given on behalf of the scissors and shears industry argued
that “in the event of a national emergency and imports cutoff, the United States would be with-
out a source of scissors and shears, basic tools for many industries and trades essential to our
national defense.” The question lies not in the merit of the argument, but in just how seriously it
can be taken if every industry uses it.
Protection Discourages Dependency
Closely related to the national defense argu-
ment is the claim that countries, particularly small or developing countries, may come to rely too
heavily on one or more trading partners for many items. If a small country comes to rely on a
major power for food or energy or some important raw material in which the large nation has a
comparative advantage, it may be difficult for the smaller nation to remain politically neutral.
Some critics of free trade argue that larger countries, such as the United States, Russia, and China
have consciously engaged in trade with smaller countries to create these kinds of dependencies.
Therefore, should small, independent countries consciously avoid trading relationships that
might lead to political dependence? This objective may involve developing domestic industries in
areas where a country has a comparative disadvantage. To do so would mean protecting that
industry from international competition.
Environmental Concerns
In recent years, concern about the environment has led some
people to question advantages of free trade. Some environmental groups, for example, argue that
the WTO’s free trade policies may harm the environment. The central argument is that poor
countries will become havens for polluting industries that will operate their steel and auto facto-
ries with few environmental controls.
These issues are quite complex, and there is much dispute among economists about the inter-
action between free trade and the environment. One relatively recent study of sulphur dioxide, for
example, found that in the long run, free trade reduces pollution, largely by increasing the income
of countries; richer countries typically choose policies to improve the environment.2 Thus, while
free trade and increased development initially may cause pollution levels to rise, in the long run,
prosperity is a benefit to the environment. Many also argue that there are complex trade-offs to be
made between pollution control and problems such as malnutrition and health for poor countries.
The United States and Europe both traded off faster economic growth and income against cleaner
air and water at earlier times in their development. Some argue that it is unfair for the developed
countries to impose their preferences on other countries facing more difficult trade-offs.
Nevertheless, the concern with global climate change has stimulated new thinking in this area.
A recent study by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Britain found that in 2004,
23 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions produced by China were created in the production of

CHAPTER 34
International Trade, Comparative Advantage, and Protectionism 681
exports. In other words, these emissions come not as a result of goods that China’s population is
enjoying as its income rises, but as a consequence of the consumption of the United States and
Europe, where most of these goods are going. In a world in which the effects of carbon emissions
are global and all countries are not willing to sign binding global agreements to control emissions,
trade with China may be a way for developed nations to avoid their commitments to pollution
reduction. Some have argued that penalties could be imposed on high-polluting products pro-
duced in countries that have not signed international climate control treaties as a way to ensure
that the prices of goods imported this way reflect the harm that those products cause the environ-
ment.3 Implementing these policies is, however, likely to be very complex, and some have argued
that it is a mistake to bundle trade and environmental issues. As with other areas covered in this
book, there is still disagreement among economists as to the right answer.
Protection Safeguards Infant Industries
Young industries in a given country may
have a difficult time competing with established industries in other countries. In a dynamic
world, a protected infant industry might mature into a strong industry worldwide because of
an acquired, but real, comparative advantage. If such an industry is undercut and driven out of
world markets at the beginning of its life, that comparative advantage might never develop.
Yet efforts to protect infant industries can backfire. In July 1991, the U.S. government
imposed a 62.67 percent tariff on imports of active-matrix liquid crystal display screens (also
referred to as “flat-panel displays” used primarily for laptop computers) from Japan. The
Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission agreed that Japanese producers
were selling their screens in the U.S. market at a price below cost and that this dumping threat-
ened the survival of domestic laptop screen producers. The tariff was meant to protect the infant
U.S. industry until it could compete head-on with the Japanese.
Unfortunately for U.S. producers of laptop computers and for consumers who purchase
them, the tariff had an unintended (although predictable) effect on the industry. Because U.S.
laptop screens were generally recognized to be of lower quality than their Japanese counterparts,
imposition of the tariff left U.S. computer manufacturers with three options: (1) They could use
the screens available from U.S. producers and watch sales of their final product decline in the face
of higher-quality competition from abroad, (2) they could pay the tariff for the higher-quality
screens and watch sales of their final product decline in the face of lower-priced competition from
abroad, or (3) they could do what was most profitable for them to do—move their production
facilities abroad to avoid the tariff completely. The last option is what Apple and IBM did. In the
end, not only were the laptop industry and its consumers hurt by the imposition of the tariff
(due to higher costs of production and to higher laptop computer prices), but the U.S. screen
industry was hurt as well (due to its loss of buyers for its product) by a policy specifically
designed to help it.
The case for free trade has been made across the world as increasing numbers of countries
have joined the world marketplace. Figure 34.5 traces the path of tariffs across the world from

1. All economies, regardless of their size, depend to some
extent on other economies and are affected by events outside
their borders.
TRADE SURPLUSES AND DEFICITS p. 664
2. Until the 1970s, the United States generally exported more
than it imported—it ran a trade surplus. In the mid-1970s,
the United States began to import more merchandise than it
exported—a trade deficit.
THE ECONOMIC BASIS FOR TRADE: COMPARATIVE
ADVANTAGE p. 665 
3. The theory of comparative advantage, dating to David
Ricardo in the nineteenth century, holds that specialization
and free trade will benefit all trading partners, even those
that may be absolutely less efficient producers.
4. A country enjoys an absolute advantage over another country
in the production of a product if it uses fewer resources 
to produce that product than the other country does. A
country has a comparative advantage in the production of a
product if that product can be produced at a lower cost in
terms of other goods.
5. Trade enables countries to move beyond their previous
resource and productivity constraints. When countries spe-
cialize in producing those goods in which they have a com-
parative advantage, they maximize their combined output
and allocate their resources more efficiently.
6. When trade is free, patterns of trade and trade flows result
from the independent decisions of thousands of importers
and exporters and millions of private households and firms.
7. The relative attractiveness of foreign goods to U.S. buyers
and of U.S. goods to foreign buyers depends in part on
exchange rates, the ratios at which two currencies are traded
for each other.
8. For any pair of countries, there is a range of exchange rates
that will lead automatically to both countries realizing the
gains from specialization and comparative advantage.
Within that range, the exchange rate will determine which
country gains the most from trade. This leads us to conclude
that exchange rates determine the terms of trade.
9. If exchange rates end up in the right range (that is, in a range
that facilitates the flow of goods between nations), the free
market will drive each country to shift resources into those
sectors in which it enjoys a comparative advantage. Only
those products in which a country has a comparative advan-
tage will be competitive in world markets.
THE SOURCES OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE p. 672 
10. The Heckscher-Ohlin theorem looks to relative factor
endowments to explain comparative advantage and trade
flows. According to the theorem, a country has a compara-
tive advantage in the production of a product if that coun-
try is relatively well endowed with the inputs that are used
intensively in the production of that product.
11. A relatively short list of inputs—natural resources, knowl-
edge capital, physical capital, land, and skilled and unskilled
labor—explains a surprisingly large portion of world trade
patterns. However, the simple version of the theory of com-
parative advantage cannot explain why many countries
import and export the same goods.
12. Some theories argue that comparative advantage can be
acquired. Just as industries within a country differentiate
their products to capture a domestic market, they also differ-
entiate their products to please the wide variety of tastes that
exists worldwide. This theory is consistent with the theory of
comparative advantage.
S U M M A R Y
1980–2005. The lines show an index of trade openness, calculated as 100 minus the tariff rate. (So
higher numbers mean lower tariffs.) We see rapid reductions in the last 25 years across the world,
most notably in countries in the emerging and developing markets.
An Economic Consensus
You now know something about how international trade fits into the structure of the economy.
Critical to our study of international economics is the debate between free traders and pro-
tectionists. On one side is the theory of comparative advantage, formalized by David Ricardo in
the early part of the nineteenth century. According to this view, all countries benefit from special-
ization and trade. The gains from trade are real, and they can be large; free international trade
raises real incomes and improves the standard of living.
On the other side are the protectionists, who point to the loss of jobs and argue for the protec-
tion of workers from foreign competition.Although foreign competition can cause job loss in spe-
cific sectors, it is unlikely to cause net job loss in an economy and workers will, over time, be
absorbed into expanding sectors. Foreign trade and full employment can be pursued simultane-
ously.Although economists disagree about many things, the vast majority of them favor free trade.

TRADE BARRIERS: TARIFFS, EXPORT SUBSIDIES,
AND QUOTAS p. 673 
13. Trade barriers take many forms. The three most common
are tariffs, export subsidies, and quotas. All are forms of
protection through which some sector of the economy is
shielded from foreign competition.
14. Although the United States has historically been a high-tariff
nation, the general movement is now away from tariffs and
quotas. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
signed by the United States and 22 other countries in 1947,
continues in effect today; its purpose is to reduce barriers to
world trade and keep them down. Also important are the
U.S.-Canadian Free Trade Agreement, signed in 1988, and the
North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by the United
States, Mexico, and Canada in the last days of the George H.
W. Bush administration in 1992, taking effect in 1994.
15. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was set up by GATT
to act as a negotiating forum for trade disputes across
countries.
16. The European Union (EU) is a free-trade bloc composed
of 27 nations: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and
the United Kingdom. Many economists believe that the
advantages of free trade within the bloc, a reunited
Germany, and the ability to work well as a bloc will make
the EU the most powerful player in the international
marketplace in the coming decades.
FREE TRADE OR PROTECTION? p. 676
17. In one sense, the theory of comparative advantage is the case
for free trade. Trade barriers prevent a nation from reaping
the benefits of specialization, push it to adopt relatively inef-
ficient production techniques, and force consumers to pay
higher prices for protected products than they would other-
wise pay.
18. The case for protection rests on a number of propositions,
one of which is that foreign competition results in a loss of
domestic jobs, but there is no reason to believe that the
workers laid off in the contracting sectors will not be ulti-
mately reemployed in other expanding sectors. This adjust-
ment process is far from costless, however.
19. Other arguments for protection hold that cheap foreign
labor makes competition unfair; that some countries
engage in unfair trade practices; that free trade might harm
the environment; and that protection safeguards the
national security, discourages dependency, and shields
infant industries. Despite these arguments, most economists
favor free trade.

example, the United States both imports and exports shirts.
How do you explain this?
8. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 676] Review the
Economics in Practice on p. 676. Despite the reduction in tariffs
brought about by the passage of trade agreements such as
GATT, the recent recession has generated political pressure in
many countries to again impose import tariffs, with this pres-
sure especially strong in the case of imports from China. Why
would a recession create pressure to impose tariffs? Who is
likely to be in favor of imposing these tariffs, and who might be
in favor of reducing or eliminating them? Do some research on
the imposition of tariffs during the recent recession. Did many
countries actually impose new tariffs on imports? What has
been the response of the WTO and countries like China to the
imposition of these tariffs?
9. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 679] When a pres-
ident presents a trade agreement for ratification to Congress,
many domestic industries fight the ratification. In 2005, the
United States was negotiating the Central America-Dominican
Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). Write a brief
essay on the U.S. political opposition to CAFTA-DR in 2004 and
2005. What industries in the United States opposed the trade
agreement? Is it fair to compare the arguments of these indus-
tries to the arguments posed by the candle makers?

b. The government opens the market to free trade, and Columbia
enters the market, pricing coffee at $1 per pound. What will
happen to the domestic price of coffee? What will be the new
domestic quantity supplied and domestic quantity demanded?
How much coffee will be imported from Columbia?
c. After numerous complaints from domestic coffee producers,
the government imposes a $0.50 per pound tariff on all
imported coffee. What will happen to the domestic price of
coffee? What will be the new domestic quantity supplied and
domestic quantity demanded? How much coffee will now be
imported from Columbia?
d. How much revenue will the government receive from the
$0.50 per pound tariff?
e. Who ultimately ends up paying the $0.50 per pound 
tariff? Why?
11. Refer to the previous problem. Assume the market is opened to
trade and Columbia still enters the market by pricing coffee at
$1.00 per pound. But as a response to complaints from domestic
coffee producers, instead of imposing a $0.50 per pound tariff,
the government imposes an import quota of 50 million pounds
on Columbian coffee. How will the results of the quota differ
from the results of the tariff?
12. The nation of Pixley has an absolute advantage in everything it
produces compared to the nation of Hooterville. Could these
two nations still benefit by trading with each other? Explain.
13. Evaluate the following statement: If lower exchange rates
increase a nation’s exports, the government should do every-
thing in its power to ensure that the exchange rate for its cur-
rency is as low as possible.
14. Since the 1960s, the United States has had an embargo in place
on Cuba, virtually eliminating all trade between the two coun-
tries. Suppose the United States decided to lift the embargo on
exports to Cuba while maintaining the embargo on Cuban
imports. Explain whether this one-sided change would benefit
neither country, just one country, or both countries?

The economies of the world have
become increasingly interdepen-
dent over the last four decades. No
economy operates in a vacuum, and
economic events in one country can
have significant repercussions on
the economies of other countries.
International trade is a major
part of today’s world economy. U.S.
imports now account for about 
15 percent of U.S. gross domestic
product (GDP), and billions of dol-
lars flow through the international
capital market each day.In Chapter 34,
we explored the main reasons why there is international exchange. Countries trade with one
another to obtain goods and services they cannot produce themselves or to take advantage of the
fact that other countries can produce goods and services at a lower cost than they can.You can see
the various connections between the domestic economy and the rest of the world in the circular
flow diagram in Figure 20.3 on p. 413. Foreign countries supply goods and services to the United
States, and the United States supplies goods and services to the rest of the world.
From a macroeconomic point of view, the main difference between an international transac-
tion and a domestic transaction concerns currency exchange. When people in countries with dif-
ferent currencies buy from and sell to each other, an exchange of currencies must also take place.
Brazilian coffee exporters cannot spend U.S. dollars in Brazil—they need Brazilian reals. A U.S.
wheat exporter cannot use Brazilian reals to buy a tractor from a U.S. company or to pay the rent
on warehouse facilities. Somehow international exchange must be managed in a way that allows
both partners in the transaction to wind up with their own currency.
As you know from Chapter 34, the direction of trade between two countries depends on
exchange rates—the price of one country’s currency in terms of the other country’s currency. If
the Japanese yen were very expensive (making the dollar cheap), both Japanese and Americans
would buy from U.S. producers. If the yen were very cheap (making the U.S. dollar expensive),
both Japanese and Americans would buy from Japanese producers. Within a certain range of
exchange rates, trade flows in both directions, each country specializes in producing the goods in
which it enjoys a comparative advantage, and trade is mutually beneficial.
Because exchange rates are a factor in determining the flow of international trade, the way
they are determined is very important. Since 1900, the world monetary system has been changed
several times by international agreements and events. In the early part of the twentieth century,
nearly all currencies were backed by gold. Their values were fixed in terms of a specific number of
ounces of gold, which determined their values in international trading—exchange rates.

PART VII
The World Economy  
In 1944, with the international monetary system in chaos as the end of World War II drew near, a
large group of experts unofficially representing 44 countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,
and drew up a number of agreements. One of those agreements established a system of essentially
fixed exchange rates under which each country agreed to intervene by buying and selling currencies in
the foreign exchange market when necessary to maintain the agreed-to value of its currency.
In 1971, most countries, including the United States, gave up trying to fix exchange rates for-
mally and began allowing them to be determined essentially by supply and demand. For example,
without government intervention in the marketplace, the price of British pounds in dollars is
determined by the interaction of those who want to exchange dollars for pounds (those who
“demand” pounds) and those who want to exchange pounds for dollars (those who “supply”
pounds). If the quantity of pounds demanded exceeds the quantity of pounds supplied, the price
of pounds will rise, just as the price of peanuts or paper clips would rise under similar circum-
stances. A more detailed discussion of the various monetary systems that have been in place since
1900 is provided in the Appendix to this chapter.
In this chapter, we explore in more detail what has come to be called open-economy 
macroeconomics. First, we discuss the balance of payments—the record of a nation’s transactions
with the rest of the world. We then go on to consider how the analysis changes when we allow for
the international exchange of goods, services, and capital.
The Balance of Payments
We sometimes lump all foreign currencies—euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen, Brazilian reals, and
so forth—together as “foreign exchange.” Foreign exchange is simply all currencies other than
the domestic currency of a given country (in the case of the United States, the U.S. dollar). U.S.
demand for foreign exchange arises because its citizens want to buy things whose prices are
quoted in other currencies, such as Australian jewelry, vacations in Mexico, and bonds or stocks
issued by Sony Corporation of Japan. Whenever U.S. citizens make these purchases, they first buy
the foreign currencies and then make the purchases.
Where does the supply of foreign exchange come from? The answer is simple: The United States
(actually U.S. citizens or firms) earns foreign exchange when it sells products, services, or assets to
another country. Just as Mexico earns foreign exchange when U.S. tourists visit Cancún, the United
States earns foreign exchange (in this case, Mexican pesos) when Mexican tourists come to the
United States to visit Disney World. Similarly, Saudi Arabian purchases of stock in General Motors
and Colombian purchases of real estate in Miami increase the U.S. supply of foreign exchange.
The record of a country’s transactions in goods, services, and assets with the rest of the world
is its balance of payments. The balance of payments is also the record of a country’s sources
(supply) and uses (demand) of foreign exchange.1
The Current Account
The balance of payments is divided into two major accounts, the current account and the capital
account. These are shown in Table 35.1, which provides data on the U.S. balance of payments for
2009. We begin with the current account.
The first item in the current account is U.S. trade in goods. This category includes exports of
computer chips, potato chips, and CDs of U.S. musicians and imports of Scotch whiskey, Chinese
toys, and Mexican oil. U.S. exports earn foreign exchange for the United States and are a credit
(+) item on the current account. U.S. imports use up foreign exchange and are a debit (-) item. In
2009, the United States imported $517.1 billion more in goods than it exported.
Next in the current account is services. Like most other countries, the United States buys ser-
vices from and sells services to other countries. For example, a U.S. firm shipping wheat to
England might purchase insurance from a British insurance company. A Dutch flower grower may
fly flowers to the United States aboard an American airliner. In the first case, the United States is
importing services and therefore using up foreign exchange; in the second case, it is selling services
to foreigners and earning foreign exchange. In 2009, the United States exported $138.4 billion
more in services than it imported.
1 Bear in mind the distinction between the balance of payments and a balance sheet. A balance sheet for a firm or a country mea-
sures that entity’s stock of assets and liabilities at a moment in time. The balance of payments, by contrast, measures flows, usu-
ally over a period of a month, a quarter, or a year. Despite its name, the balance of payments is not a balance sheet.

balance of payments
The record of a country’s
transactions in goods, services,
and assets with the rest of the
world; also the record of a
country’s sources (supply) and
uses (demand) of foreign
exchange.

CHAPTER 35
Open-Economy Macroeconomics: The Balance of Payments and Exchange Rates 689
The difference between a country’s exports of goods and services and its imports of goods
and services is its balance of trade. When exports of goods and services are less than imports of
goods and services, a country has a trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit in 2009 was large:
$378.2 billion (that is, $517.1 billion less $138.4 billion).
The third item in the current account concerns investment income. U.S. citizens hold foreign
assets (stocks, bonds, and real assets such as buildings and factories). Dividends, interest, rent,
and profits paid to U.S. asset holders are a source of foreign exchange. Conversely, when foreign-
ers earn dividends, interest, and profits on assets held in the United States, foreign exchange is
used up. In 2009, investment income received from foreigners exceeded investment income paid
to foreigners by $89.0 billion.
The fourth item in Table 35.1 is net transfer payments. Transfer payments from the United
States to foreigners are another use of foreign exchange. Some of these transfer payments are
from private U.S. citizens, and some are from the U.S. government. You may send a check to a
relief agency in Africa. Many immigrants in the United States send remittances to their countries
of origin to help support extended families. Conversely, some foreigners make transfer payments
to the United States. Net refers to the difference between payments from the United States to for-
eigners and payments from foreigners to the United States.
If we add net exports of goods, net export of services, net investment income, and net transfer
payments, we get the balance on current account. The balance on current account shows how
much a nation has spent on foreign goods, services, investment income payments, and transfers
relative to how much it has earned from other countries.When the balance is negative,which it was for
the United States in 2009, a nation has spent more on foreign goods and services (plus investment
income and transfers paid) than it has earned through the sales of its goods and services to the rest of
the world (plus investment income and transfers received).If a nation has spent more on foreign goods,
services,investment income payments,and transfers than it has earned,its net wealth position vis-à-vis
the rest of the world must decrease. By net, we mean a nation’s assets abroad minus its liabilities to the
rest of the world.The capital account of the balance of payments records the changes in these assets and
liabilities.We now turn to the capital account.

balance on capital account
In the United States, the sum
of the following (measured in a
given period): the change in
private U.S. assets abroad, the
change in foreign private assets
in the United States, the
change in U.S. government
assets abroad, and the change
in foreign government assets in
the United States.
The Capital Account
For each transaction recorded in the current account, there is an offsetting transaction
recorded in the capital account. Consider the purchase of a Japanese car by a U.S. citizen. Say
that the yen/dollar exchange rate is 100 yen to a dollar and that the yen price of the car is
2.0 million yen, which is $20,000. The U.S. citizen (probably an automobile dealer) takes
$20,000, buys 2.0 million yen, and then buys the car. In this case, U.S. imports are increased
by $20,000 in the current account and foreign assets in the United States (in this case,
Japanese holdings of dollars) are increased by $20,000 in the capital account. The net wealth
position of the United States vis-à-vis the rest of the world has decreased by $20,000. The key
point to realize is that an increase in U.S. imports results in an increase in foreign assets in
the United States. The United States must “pay” for the imports, and whatever it pays with
(in this example, U.S. dollars) is an increase in foreign assets in the United States. Conversely,
an increase in U.S. exports results in an increase in U.S. assets abroad because foreigners
must pay for the U.S. exports.
Table 35.1 shows that U.S. assets abroad are divided into private holdings (line 6) and U.S.
government holdings (line 8). Similarly, foreign assets in the United States are divided into for-
eign private (line 7) and foreign government (line 9). The sum of lines 6, 7, 8, and 9 is the
balance on capital account (line 10). The next item is called net capital account transactions
(line 11). It is quite small in value and includes things such as U.S. government debt forgive-
ness. These kinds of transactions affect the capital account but not the current account.
Ignoring this item, if there were no errors of measurement in the data collection, the balance
on capital account would equal the negative of the balance on current account because, as
mentioned previously, for each transaction in the current account, there is an offsetting trans-
action in the capital account. Another way of looking at the balance on capital account is that
it is the change in the net wealth position of the country vis-à-vis the rest of the world. When
the balance on capital account is positive, this means that the change in foreign assets in the
country is greater than the change in the country’s assets abroad, which is a decrease in the net
wealth position of the country.
Table 35.1 shows that in 2009, the U.S. balance on current account was -$419.9 billion, which
means that the United States spent considerably more than it made vis-à-vis the rest of the world.
If the balance on current account is measured correctly, the net wealth position of the United
States vis-à-vis the rest of the world should have decreased by $419.9 billion in 2009 plus the
$2.9 billion in line 11, or $422.8 billion. The balance on capital account (line 10) is in fact
$197.9 billion; so the error of measurement, called the statistical discrepancy, is $224.9 billion
(line 12) in 2009. The balance of payments (line 13) is the sum of the balance on current account,
the balance on capital account, net capital account transactions, and the statistical discrepancy. By
construction, it is always zero.
It is important to note from Table 35.1 that even though the net wealth position of the
United States decreased in 2009, the change in U.S. assets abroad increased ($727.0 billion
private minus $489.6 billion government). How can this be? Because there was an even larger
increase in foreign assets in the United States (–$12.3 billion private plus $447.6 billion gov-
ernment). It is the net change (that is, the change in foreign assets in the United States minus
the change in U.S. assets abroad) that is equal to the negative of the balance on current
account (aside from the statistical discrepancy), not the change in just U.S. assets abroad.
Much of the increase of $447.6 billion in foreign government assets was the accumulation of
dollars by China.
Many transactions get recorded in the capital account that do not pertain to the current
account. Consider a purchase of a U.K. security by a U.S. resident. This is done by the U.S.
resident’s selling dollars for pounds and using the pounds to buy the U.K. security. After this
transaction, U.S. assets abroad have increased (the United States now holds more U.K. securi-
ties) and foreign assets in the United States have increased (foreigners now hold more dollars).
The purchase of the U.K. security is recorded as a minus item in line 6 in Table 35.1, and the
increase in foreign holdings of dollars is recorded as a plus item in line 7. These two balance
out. This happens whenever there is a switch of one kind of asset for another vis-à-vis the rest
of the world. In recent years, a number of business people from the oil-rich Middle East pur-
chased apartments in U.S. cities like New York and San Francisco. These real estate investments

CHAPTER 35
Open-Economy Macroeconomics: The Balance of Payments and Exchange Rates 691
increased foreign assets in the United States (real estate) and increased U.S. assets abroad (for-
eign currency from the Middle East).
The United States as a Debtor Nation
If a country has a positive net wealth position vis-à-vis the rest of the world, it can be said to
be a creditor nation. Conversely, if it has a negative net wealth position, it can be said to be a
debtor nation. Remember that a country’s net wealth position increases if it has a positive
current account balance and decreases if it has a negative current account balance. It is
important to realize that the only way a country’s net wealth position can change is if its cur-
rent account balance is nonzero. Simply switching one form of asset for another, such as trad-
ing real estate for foreign currency, is not a change in a country’s net wealth position. Another
way of putting this is that a country’s net wealth position is the sum of all its past current
account balances.
Prior to the mid-1970s, the United States had generally run current account surpluses,
and thus its net wealth position was positive. It was a creditor nation. This began to turn
around in the mid-1970s, and by the mid-1980s, the United States was running large current
account deficits. Sometime during this period, the United States changed from having a pos-
itive net wealth position vis-à-vis the rest of the world to having a negative position. In other
words, the United States changed from a creditor nation to a debtor nation. The current
account deficits persisted into the 1990s, and the United States is now the largest debtor
nation in the world. In 2008, foreign assets in the United States totaled $23.7 trillion and
U.S. assets abroad totaled $19.9 trillion.2 The U.S. net wealth position was thus -$3.5 tril-
lion. This large negative position reflects the fact that the United States spent much more in
the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s on foreign goods and services (plus investment income and
transfers paid) than it earned through the sales of its goods and services to the rest of the
world (plus investment income and transfers received).

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Trade gaps, or deficits, occur when a country’s imports of goods and ser-
vices outweigh its exports. These trade gaps can change because an entre-
preneur from one country invents and produces something that generates
big sales abroad or because imports from one country have a big price
change. Denmark, for example, runs a trade surplus with Japan largely
because of its sales of Legos. Norway’s exports are dominated by fish and
crude oil, and its trade balance as a result is relatively volatile following oil
price movements. The article below describes the narrowing of France’s
trade deficit in 2010 as oil—one of its imports—declined in price and as
sales of the Airbus—one of its export goods—grew.
French Trade Gap Narrowed Sharply in 2009
The Wall Street Journal
PARIS—France’s trade deficit narrowed substantially in 2009
from 2008, due to a lower energy bill resulting from a decline
in oil prices.
In December, exports dropped slightly to E28.96 billion
from E28.97 billion in November, while imports declined to
E33.23 billion from E33.94 billion.
Aircraft maker Airbus, a unit of Franco-German
aerospace group European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Co. NV, sold 27 aircraft in December for E1.44 billion
in total, compared with 17 sold in November for 
E1.15 billion.

The World Economy  
Planned aggregate expenditure in an open economy:
AE  C + I + G + EX - IM
The last two terms (EX - IM) together are the country’s net exports of goods and services.
Determining the Level of Imports
What determines the level of imports and exports
in a country? For now, we assume that the level of imports is a function of income (Y). The ratio-
nale is simple: When U.S. income increases, U.S. citizens buy more of everything, including U.S.
cars and peanut butter, Japanese TV sets, and Korean steel and DVD players. When income rises,
imports tend to go up. Algebraically,
IM = mY
where Y is income and m is some positive number. (m is assumed to be less than 1; otherwise, a
$1 increase in income generates an increase in imports of more than $1, which is unrealistic.) Recall
from Chapter 23 that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) measures the change in consump-
tion that results from a $1 change in income. Similarly, the marginal propensity to import, abbrevi-
ated as MPM or m, is the change in imports caused by a $1 change in income. If m = .2, or 20 percent,
and income is $1,000, then imports, IM, are equal to .2  $1,000 = $200. If income rises by $100 to
$1,100, the change in imports will equal m  (the change in income) = .2  $100 = $20.
For now we will assume that exports (EX) are given (that is, they are not affected, even indi-
rectly, by the state of the economy.) This assumption is relaxed later in this chapter.
Solving for Equilibrium
Given the assumption about how imports are determined, we
can solve for equilibrium income. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 35.1. Starting from the
consumption function (blue line) in Figure 35.1(a), we gradually build up the components of
planned aggregate expenditure (red line). Assuming for simplicity that planned investment, gov-
ernment purchases, and exports are all constant and do not depend on income, we move easily
from the blue line to the red line by adding the fixed amounts of I, G, and EX to consumption at
every level of income. In this example, we take I + G + EX to equal 80.
C + I + G + EX, however, includes spending on imports, which are not part of domestic pro-
duction. To get spending on domestically produced goods, we must subtract the amount that is

Equilibrium Output (Income) in an Open
Economy
Everything we have said so far has been descriptive. Now we turn to analysis. How are all these
trade and capital flows determined? What impacts do they have on the economies of the coun-
tries involved? To simplify our discussion, we will assume that exchange rates are fixed. We will
relax this assumption later.
The International Sector and Planned Aggregate Expenditure
Our earlier descriptions of the multiplier took into account the consumption behavior of house-
holds (C), the planned investment behavior of firms (I), and the spending of the government (G).
We defined the sum of those three components as planned aggregate expenditure (AE).
To analyze the international sector, we must include the goods and services a country exports
to the rest of the world as well as what it imports. If we call our exports of goods and services EX,
it should be clear that EX is a component of total output and income. A U.S. razor sold to a buyer
in Mexico is as much a part of U.S. production as a similar razor sold in Pittsburgh. Exports sim-
ply represent demand for domestic products not by domestic households and firms and the gov-
ernment, but by the rest of the world.
What about imports (IM)? Remember, imports are not a part of domestic output (Y). By def-
inition, imports are not produced by the country that is importing them. Remember also, when
we look at households’ total consumption spending, firms’ total investment spending, and total
government spending, imports are included. Therefore, to calculate domestic output correctly,
we must subtract the parts of consumption, investment, and government spending that consti-
tute imports. The definition of planned aggregate expenditure becomes:

CHAPTER 35
Open-Economy Macroeconomics: The Balance of Payments and Exchange Rates 693
imported at each level of income. In Figure 35.1(b), we assume m = .25, which is the assumption
that 25 percent of total income is spent on goods and services produced in foreign countries.
Imports under this assumption are a constant fraction of total income; therefore, at higher levels
of income, a larger amount is spent on foreign goods and services. For example, at Y = 200, IM =
.25 Y, or 50. Similarly, at Y = 400, IM = .25 Y, or 100. Figure 35.1(b) shows the planned domestic
aggregate expenditure curve.
Equilibrium is reached when planned domestic aggregate expenditure equals domestic aggre-
gate output (income). This is true at only one level of aggregate output, Y* = 200, in Figure 35.1(b).
If Y were below Y*, planned expenditure would exceed output, inventories would be lower than
planned, and output would rise. At levels above Y*, output would exceed planned expenditure,
inventories would be larger than planned, and output would fall.
The Open-Economy Multiplier
All of this has implications for the size of the multi-
plier. Recall the multiplier, introduced in Chapter 23, and consider a sustained rise in government
purchases (G). Initially, the increase in G will cause planned aggregate expenditure to be greater
than aggregate output. Domestic firms will find their inventories to be lower than planned and
thus will increase their output, but added output means more income. More workers are hired,
and profits are higher. Some of the added income is saved, and some is spent. The added con-
sumption spending leads to a second round of inventories being lower than planned and raising
output. Equilibrium output rises by a multiple of the initial increase in government purchases.
This is the multiplier.
In Chapters 23 and 24, we showed that the simple multiplier equals 1/(1 - MPC), or
(1/MPS). That is, a sustained increase in government purchases equal to G will lead to an
increase in aggregate output (income) of G [1/(1 - MPC)]. If the MPC were .75 and govern-
ment purchases rose by $10 billion, equilibrium income would rise by 4  $10 billion, or $40 bil-
lion. The multiplier is [1/(1 - .75)] = [1/.25] = 4.0.
In an open economy, some of the increase in income brought about by the increase in G is
spent on imports instead of domestically produced goods and services. The part of income spent
on imports does not increase domestic income (Y) because imports are produced by foreigners.
To compute the multiplier, we need to know how much of the increased income is used to
increase domestic consumption. (We are assuming all imports are consumption goods. In prac-
tice, some imports are investment goods and some are goods purchased by the government.) In
other words, we need to know the marginal propensity to consume domestic goods. Domestic
consumption is C - IM. So the marginal propensity to consume domestic goods is the marginal

propensity to consume all goods (the MPC) minus the marginal propensity to import (the
MPM). The marginal propensity to consume domestic goods is (MPC - MPM). Consequently,
open-economy multipler = 
If the MPC is .75 and the MPM is .25,then the multiplier is 1/.5,or 2.0.This multiplier is smaller
than the multiplier in which imports are not taken into account, which is 1/.25, or 4.0. The effect of a
sustained increase in government spending (or investment) on income—that is, the multiplier—is
smaller in an open economy than in a closed economy. The reason: When government spending (or
investment) increases and income and consumption rise, some of the extra consumption spending
that results is on foreign products and not on domestically produced goods and services.
Imports and Exports and the Trade Feedback Effect
For simplicity, we have so far assumed that the level of imports depends only on income 
and that the level of exports is fixed. In reality, the amount of spending on imports depends on fac-
tors other than income and exports are not fixed. We will now consider the more realistic picture.
The Determinants of Imports
The same factors that affect households’ consumption
behavior and firms’ investment behavior are likely to affect the demand for imports because some
imported goods are consumption goods and some are investment goods. For example, anything
that increases consumption spending is likely to increase the demand for imports. We saw in
Chapters 23 and 26 that factors such as the after-tax real wage, after-tax nonlabor income, and
interest rates affect consumption spending; thus, they should also affect spending on imports.
Similarly, anything that increases investment spending is likely to increase the demand for
imports. A decrease in interest rates, for example, should encourage spending on both domesti-
cally produced goods and foreign-produced goods.
There is one additional consideration in determining spending on imports: the relative prices
of domestically produced and foreign-produced goods. If the prices of foreign goods fall relative
to the prices of domestic goods, people will consume more foreign goods relative to domestic
goods. When Japanese cars are inexpensive relative to U.S. cars, consumption of Japanese cars
should be high and vice versa.
The Determinants of Exports
We now relax our assumption that exports are fixed. The
demand for U.S. exports by other countries is identical to their demand for imports from the
United States. Germany imports goods, some of which are U.S.-produced. France, Spain, and so
on do the same. Total expenditure on imports in Germany is a function of the factors we just dis-
cussed except that the variables are German variables instead of U.S. variables. This is true for all
other countries as well. The demand for U.S. exports depends on economic activity in the rest of
the world—rest-of-the-world real wages, wealth, nonlabor income, interest rates, and so forth—
as well as on the prices of U.S. goods relative to the price of rest-of-the-world goods. When for-
eign output increases, U.S. exports tend to increase. U.S. exports also tend to increase when U.S.
prices fall relative to those in the rest of the world.
The Trade Feedback Effect
We can now combine what we know about the demand
for imports and the demand for exports to discuss the trade feedback effect. Suppose the
United States finds its exports increasing, perhaps because the world suddenly decides it
prefers U.S. computers to other computers. Rising exports will lead to an increase in U.S. out-
put (income), which leads to an increase in U.S. imports. Here is where the trade feedback
begins. Because U.S. imports are somebody else’s exports, the extra import demand from the
United States raises the exports of the rest of the world. When other countries’ exports to the
United States go up,their output and incomes also rise,in turn leading to an increase in the demand
for imports from the rest of the world. Some of the extra imports demanded by the rest of
the world come from the United States, so U.S. exports increase. The increase in U.S. exports
stimulates U.S. economic activity even more, triggering a further increase in the U.S. demand
for imports and so on. An increase in U.S. imports increases other countries’ exports, which
stimulates those countries’ economies and increases their imports, which increases U.S.
exports, which stimulates the U.S. economy and increases its imports, and so on. This is the

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
The Recession Takes Its Toll on Trade
During recessions, people in many countries become more protection-
ist and seek to protect jobs in their own home industries by limiting
imports.Chapter 34 described some of the economic costs of this pro-
tectionism. What fewer people recognize is the effect of recessions on
the overall level of trade in the world. As the text describes, there is a
trade-feedback effect in which growth in one country leads to growth
in other countries, further enhancing growth in the first country. In
the recession of 2008–2009, this feedback effect was quite apparent
(in the negative direction).
The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) collects data on trade levels for a number of
countries. The figure below shows the rise in trade levels in the
world over the period 2005 to the middle of 2008 followed by large
declines in the 2008–2009 recession.

trade feedback effect. In other words, an increase in U.S. economic activity leads to a world-
wide increase in economic activity, which then “feeds back” to the United States.
Import and Export Prices and the Price Feedback Effect
We have talked about the price of imports, but we have not yet discussed the factors that influence
import prices. The consideration of import prices is complicated because more than one currency
is involved. When we talk about “the price of imports,” do we mean the price in dollars, in yen, in
U.K. pounds, in Mexican pesos, and so on? Because the exports of one country are the imports of
another, the same question holds for the price of exports. When Mexico exports auto parts to the
United States, Mexican manufacturers are interested in the price of auto parts in terms of pesos
because pesos are what they use for transactions in Mexico. U.S. consumers are interested in the
price of auto parts in dollars because dollars are what they use for transactions in the United
States. The link between the two prices is the dollar/peso exchange rate.
Suppose Mexico is experiencing inflation and the price of radiators in pesos rises from 
1,000 pesos to 1,200 pesos per radiator. If the dollar/peso exchange rate remains unchanged at, say,
$0.10 per peso, Mexico’s export price for radiators in terms of dollars will also rise, from $100 to
$120 per radiator. Because Mexico’s exports to the United States are, by definition, U.S. imports
from Mexico, an increase in the dollar prices of Mexican exports to the United States means an
increase in the prices of U.S. imports from Mexico. Therefore, when Mexico’s export prices rise
with no change in the dollar/peso exchange rate, U.S. import prices rise. Export prices of other
countries affect U.S. import prices.
A country’s export prices tend to move fairly closely with the general price level in that coun-
try. If Mexico is experiencing a general increase in prices, this change likely will be reflected in
price increases of all domestically produced goods, both exportable and nonexportable. The gen-
eral rate of inflation abroad is likely to affect U.S. import prices. If the inflation rate abroad is
high, U.S. import prices are likely to rise.
The Price Feedback Effect
We have just seen that when a country experiences an
increase in domestic prices, the prices of its exports will increase. It is also true that when the
prices of a country’s imports increase, the prices of domestic goods may increase in response.
There are at least two ways this effect can occur.

696
PART VII
The World Economy  
First, an increase in the prices of imported inputs will shift a country’s aggregate supply
curve to the left. In Chapter 28, we discussed the macroeconomy’s response to a cost shock. Recall
that a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve due to a cost increase causes aggregate output
to fall and prices to rise (stagflation).
Second, if import prices rise relative to domestic prices, households will tend to substitute
domestically produced goods and services for imports. This is equivalent to a rightward shift of
the aggregate demand curve. If the domestic economy is operating on the upward-sloping part of
the aggregate supply curve, the overall domestic price level will rise in response to an increase in
aggregate demand. Perfectly competitive firms will see market-determined prices rise, and
imperfectly competitive firms will experience an increase in the demand for their products.
Studies have shown, for example, that the price of automobiles produced in the United States
moves closely with the price of imported cars.
Still, this is not the end of the story. Suppose a country—say, Mexico—experiences an
increase in its domestic price level. This will increase the price of its exports to Canada (and to all
other countries). The increase in the price of Canadian imports from Mexico will lead to an
increase in domestic prices in Canada. Canada also exports to Mexico. The increase in Canadian
prices causes an increase in the price of Canadian exports to Mexico, which then further increases
the Mexican price level.
This is called the price feedback effect, in the sense that inflation is “exportable.” An
increase in the price level in one country can drive up prices in other countries, which in turn fur-
ther increases the price level in the first country. Through export and import prices, a domestic
price increase can “feed back” on itself.
It is important to realize that the discussion so far has been based on the assumption of fixed
exchange rates. Life is more complicated under flexible exchange rates, to which we now turn.
The Open Economy with Flexible 
Exchange Rates
To a large extent, the fixed exchange rates set by the Bretton Woods agreements served as interna-
tional monetary arrangements until 1971. Then in 1971, the United States and most other coun-
tries decided to abandon the fixed exchange rate system in favor of floating, or
market-determined, exchange rates. Although governments still intervene to ensure that
exchange rate movements are “orderly,”exchange rates today are largely determined by the unreg-
ulated forces of supply and demand.
Understanding how an economy interacts with the rest of the world when exchange rates are
not fixed is not as simple as when we assume fixed exchange rates. Exchange rates determine the
price of imported goods relative to domestic goods and can have significant effects on the level of
imports and exports. Consider a 20 percent drop in the value of the dollar against the British
pound. Dollars buy fewer pounds, and pounds buy more dollars. Both British residents, who
now get more dollars for pounds, and U.S. residents, who get fewer pounds for dollars, find that
U.S. goods and services are more attractive. Exchange rate movements have important impacts
on imports, exports, and the movement of capital between countries.
The Market for Foreign Exchange
What determines exchange rates under a floating rate system? To explore this question, we
assume that there are just two countries, the United States and Great Britain. It is easier to under-
stand a world with only two countries, and most of the points we will make can be generalized to
a world with many trading partners.
The Supply of and Demand for Pounds
Governments, private citizens, banks, and
corporations exchange pounds for dollars and dollars for pounds every day. In our two-country
case, those who demand pounds are holders of dollars seeking to exchange them for pounds.
Those who supply pounds are holders of pounds seeking to exchange them for dollars. It is
important not to confuse the supply of dollars (or pounds) on the foreign exchange market with
price feedback effect The
process by which a domestic
price increase in one country
can “feed back” on itself
through export and import
prices. An increase in the price
level in one country can drive up
prices in other countries. This in
turn further increases the price
level in the first country.

the U.S. (or British) money supply. The latter is the sum of all the money currently in circulation.
The supply of dollars on the foreign exchange market is the number of dollars that holders seek
to exchange for pounds in a given time period. The demand for and supply of dollars on foreign
exchange markets determine exchange rates; the demand for money balances, and the total
domestic money supply determine the interest rate.
The common reason for exchanging dollars for pounds is to buy something produced in
Great Britain. U.S. importers who purchase Jaguar automobiles or Scotch whiskey must pay with
pounds. U.S. citizens traveling in Great Britain who want to ride the train, stay in a hotel, or eat at
a restaurant must acquire pounds for dollars to do so. If a U.S. corporation builds a plant in Great
Britain, it must pay for that plant in pounds.
At the same time, some people may want to buy British stocks or bonds. Implicitly, when
U.S. citizens buy a bond issued by the British government or by a British corporation, they are
making a loan, but the transaction requires a currency exchange. The British bond seller must
ultimately be paid in pounds.
On the supply side of the market, the situation is reversed. Here we find people—usually
British citizens—holding pounds they want to use to buy dollars. Again, the common reason is
to buy things produced in the United States. If a British importer decides to import golf carts
made in Georgia, the producer must be paid in dollars. British tourists visiting New York may
ride in cabs, eat in restaurants, and tour Ellis Island. Doing those things requires dollars. When
a British firm builds an office complex in Los Angeles, it must pay the contractor in dollars.
In addition to buyers and sellers who exchange money to engage in transactions, some people
and institutions hold currency balances for speculative reasons. If you think that the U.S. dollar is
going to decline in value relative to the pound, you may want to hold some of your wealth in the
form of pounds. Table 35.2 summarizes some of the major categories of private foreign exchange
demanders and suppliers in the two-country case of the United States and Great Britain.
Figure 35.2 shows the demand curve for pounds in the foreign exchange market.When the price
of pounds (the exchange rate) is lower, it takes fewer dollars to buy British goods and services, to build
a plant in Liverpool, to travel to London, and so on. Lower net prices (in dollars) should increase the
demand for British-made products and encourage investment and travel in Great Britain. If prices (in
pounds) in Britain do not change, an increase in the quantity of British goods and services demanded
by foreigners will increase the quantity of pounds demanded. The demand-for-pounds curve in the
foreign exchange market has a negative slope.
Figure 35.3 shows a supply curve for pounds in the foreign exchange market. At a higher
exchange rate, each pound buys more dollars, making the price of U.S.-produced goods and ser-
vices lower to the British. The British are more apt to buy U.S.-made goods when the price of
pounds is high (the value of the dollar is low). An increase in British demand for U.S. goods and

698
PART VII

services is likely to increase the quantity of pounds supplied. The curve representing the supply of
pounds in the foreign exchange market has a positive slope.
The Equilibrium Exchange Rate
When exchange rates are allowed to float, they are deter-
mined the same way other prices are determined: The equilibrium exchange rate occurs at the point
at which the quantity demanded of a foreign currency equals the quantity of that currency supplied.
This is illustrated in Figure 35.4. An excess demand for pounds (quantity demanded in excess of
quantity supplied) will cause the price of pounds to rise—the pound will appreciate relative to the
dollar. An excess supply of pounds will cause the price of pounds to fall—the pound will depreciate
relative to the dollar.3
3 Although Figure 35.3 shows the supply-of-pounds curve in the foreign exchange market with a positive slope, under certain
circumstances the curve may bend back. Suppose the price of a pound rises from $1.50 to $2.00. Consider a British importer
who buys 10 Chevrolets each month at $15,000 each, including transportation costs. When a pound exchanges for $1.50, he will
supply 100,000 pounds per month to the foreign exchange market—100,000 pounds brings $150,000, enough to buy 10 cars.
Now suppose the cheaper dollar causes him to buy 12 cars. Twelve cars will cost a total of $180,000; but at $2 = 1 pound, he will
spend only 90,000 pounds per month. The supply of pounds on the market falls when the price of pounds rises. The reason for
this seeming paradox is simple. The number of pounds a British importer needs to buy U.S. goods depends on both the quantity
of goods he buys and the price of those goods in pounds. If demand for imports is inelastic so that the percentage decrease in
price resulting from the depreciated currency is greater than the percentage increase in the quantity of imports demanded,
importers will spend fewer pounds and the quantity of pounds supplied in the foreign exchange market will fall. The supply of
pounds will slope upward as long as the demand for U.S. imports is elastic.

rise with the exchange rate.

CHAPTER 35

Factors That Affect Exchange Rates
We now know enough to discuss the factors likely to influence exchange rates. Anything that
changes the behavior of the people in Table 35.2 can cause demand and supply curves to shift and
the exchange rate to adjust accordingly.
Purchasing Power Parity: The Law of One Price
If the costs of transporting goods
between two countries are small, we would expect the price of the same good in both countries to
be roughly the same. The price of basketballs should be roughly the same in Canada and the
United States, for example.
It is not hard to see why. If the price of basketballs is cheaper in Canada, it will pay for someone
to buy balls in Canada at a low price and sell them in the United States at a higher price. This
decreases the supply and pushes up the price in Canada and increases the supply and pushes down
the price in the United States.This process should continue as long as the price differential,and there-
fore the profit opportunity,persists.For a good with trivial transportation costs,we would expect this
law of one price to hold. The price of a good should be the same regardless of where we buy it.
If the law of one price held for all goods and if each country consumed the same market
basket of goods, the exchange rate between the two currencies would be determined simply
by the relative price levels in the two countries. If the price of a basketball were $10 in the
United States and $12 in Canada, the U.S.–Canada exchange rate would have to be $1 U.S. per
$1.20 Canadian. If the rate were instead one-to-one, it would pay people to buy the balls in
the United States and sell them in Canada. This would increase the demand for U.S. dollars in
Canada, thereby driving up their price in terms of Canadian dollars to $1 U.S. per
$1.2 Canadian, at which point no one could make a profit shipping basketballs across inter-
national lines and the process would cease.4
The theory that exchange rates will adjust so that the price of similar goods in different
countries is the same is known as the purchasing-power-parity theory. According to this
theory, if it takes 10 times as many Mexican pesos to buy a pound of salt in Mexico as it takes
U.S. dollars to buy a pound of salt in the United States, the equilibrium exchange rate should be
10 pesos per dollar.
In practice, transportation costs for many goods are quite large and the law of one price
does not hold for these goods. (Haircuts are often cited as a good example. The transportation
costs for a U.S. resident to get a British haircut are indeed large unless that person is an airline

When exchange rates are allowed
to float, they are determined by

pounds will cause the pound to

4 Of course, if the rate were $1 U.S. to $2 Canadian, it would pay people to buy basketballs in Canada (at $12 Canadian, which is
$6 U.S.) and sell them in the United States. This would weaken demand for the U.S. dollar, and its price would fall from $2

pilot.) Also, many products that are potential substitutes for each other are not precisely iden-
tical. For instance, a Rolls Royce and a Honda are both cars, but there is no reason to expect
the exchange rate between the British pound and the yen to be set so that the prices of the two
are equalized. In addition, countries consume different market baskets of goods, so we would
not expect the aggregate price levels to follow the law of one price. Nevertheless, a high rate of
inflation in one country relative to another puts pressure on the exchange rate between the
two countries, and there is a general tendency for the currencies of relatively high-inflation
countries to depreciate.
Figure 35.5 shows the adjustment likely to occur following an increase in the U.S. price level
relative to the price level in Great Britain. This change in relative prices will affect citizens of both
countries. Higher prices in the United States make imports relatively less expensive. U.S. citizens are
likely to increase their spending on imports from Britain, shifting the demand for pounds to the
right, from D0 to D1.At the same time, the British see U.S. goods getting more expensive and reduce
their demand for exports from the United States. Consequently, the supply of pounds shifts to the
left, from S0 to S1. The result is an increase in the price of pounds. Before the change in relative
prices, 1 pound sold for $1.89; after the change, 1 pound costs $2.25. The pound appreciates, and
the dollar depreciates.
Relative Interest Rates
Another factor that influences a country’s exchange rate is the
level of its interest rate relative to other countries’ interest rates. If the interest rate is 6 percent in
the United States and 8 percent in Great Britain, people with money to lend have an incentive to
buy British securities instead of U.S. securities. Although it is sometimes difficult for individuals
in one country to buy securities in another country, it is easy for international banks and invest-
ment companies to do so. If the interest rate is lower in the United States than in Britain, there
will be a movement of funds out of U.S. securities into British securities as banks and firms move
their funds to the higher-yielding securities.
How does a U.S. bank buy British securities? It takes its dollars, buys British pounds, and uses
the pounds to buy the British securities. The bank’s purchase of pounds drives up the price of
pounds in the foreign exchange market. The increased demand for pounds increases the price of
the pound (and decreases the price of the dollar). A high interest rate in Britain relative to the
interest rate in the United States tends to depreciate the dollar.
Figure 35.6 shows the effect of rising interest rates in the United States on the dollar–pound
exchange rate.Higher interest rates in the United States attract British investors.To buy U.S.securities,
the British need dollars. The supply of pounds (the demand for dollars) shifts to the right, from S0 to
S1. The same relative interest rates affect the portfolio choices of U.S. banks, firms, and households.
With higher interest rates at home,there is less incentive for U.S.residents to buy British securities.The
demand for pounds drops at the same time the supply increases and the demand curve shifts to the
left, from D0 to D1. The net result is a depreciating pound and an appreciating dollar. The price of
pounds falls from $1.89 to $1.25.

CHAPTER 35
Open-Economy Macroeconomics: The Balance of Payments and Exchange Rates 701
The Effects of Exchange Rates on the Economy
We are now ready to discuss some of the implications of floating exchange rates. Recall, when
exchange rates are fixed, households spend some of their incomes on imports and the multiplier
is smaller than it would be otherwise. Imports are a “leakage” from the circular flow, much like
taxes and saving. Exports, in contrast, are an “injection” into the circular flow; they represent
spending on U.S.-produced goods and services from abroad and can stimulate output.
The world is far more complicated when exchange rates are allowed to float. First, the level of
imports and exports depends on exchange rates as well as on income and other factors. When
events cause exchange rates to adjust, the levels of imports and exports will change. Changes in
exports and imports can, in turn, affect the level of real GDP and the price level. Further,
exchange rates themselves also adjust to changes in the economy. Suppose the government
decides to stimulate the economy with an expansionary monetary policy. This will affect interest
rates, which may affect exchange rates.
Exchange Rate Effects on Imports, Exports, and Real GDP
As we already know,
when a country’s currency depreciates (falls in value), its import prices rise and its export prices
(in foreign currencies) fall. When the U.S. dollar is cheap, U.S. products are more competitive with
products produced in the rest of the world and foreign-made goods look expensive to U.S. citizens.
A depreciation of a country’s currency can serve as a stimulus to the economy. Suppose the
U.S. dollar falls in value, as it did sharply between 1985 and 1988. If foreign buyers increase their
spending on U.S. goods, and domestic buyers substitute U.S.-made goods for imports, aggregate
expenditure on domestic output will rise, inventories will fall, and real GDP (Y) will increase. A
depreciation of a country’s currency is likely to increase its GDP.5
Exchange Rates and the Balance of Trade: The J Curve
Because a depreciating
currency tends to increase exports and decrease imports, you might think that it also will reduce
a country’s trade deficit. In fact, the effect of a depreciation on the balance of trade is ambiguous.
Many economists believe that when a currency starts to depreciate,the balance of trade is likely to
worsen for the first few quarters (perhaps three to six). After that, the balance of trade may improve.
This effect is graphed in Figure 35.7. The curve in this figure resembles the letter J, and the movement
in the balance of trade that it describes is sometimes called the J-curve effect. The point of the J shape
is that the balance of trade gets worse before it gets better following a currency depreciation.

Relative Interest Rates
If U.S. interest rates rise relative
to British interest rates, British
citizens holding pounds may be
attracted into the U.S. securities
market. To buy bonds in the
United States, British buyers
must exchange pounds for dol-
lars. The supply of pounds shifts
to the right, from S0 to S1.
However, U.S. citizens are less
likely to be interested in British
securities because interest rates
are higher at home. The demand
for pounds shifts to the left,
from D0 to D1. The result is a
depreciated pound and a
stronger dollar.
5 For this reason, some countries are tempted at times to intervene in foreign exchange markets, depreciate their currencies, and
stimulate their economies. If all countries attempted to lower the value of their currencies simultaneously, there would be no
gain in income for any of them. Although the exchange rate system at the time was different, such a situation actually occurred
during the early years of the Great Depression. Many countries practiced so-called beggar-thy-neighbor policies of competitive
devaluations in a desperate attempt to maintain export sales and employment.

Following a
currency depreciation, a
country’s balance of trade may
get worse before it gets better.

China’s Increased Flexibility
China Warns on Currency Moves
The Wall Street Journal
SHANGHAI—A Chinese central banker said Saturday that
large foreign-exchange rate fluctuations are harmful to the
economy. Her comments follow the central bank’s decision
last month to allow more flexibility in exchange rates.
Hu Xiaolian, a vice governor of the People’s Bank of
China, also said that a country’s current-account position is
a good gauge of whether its currency is undervalued or
overvalued, and that China’s current-account position is
gradually becoming balanced, signaling the central bank
may not stomach much appreciation in the yuan.
“Certain flexibility in exchange rates is good for the econ-
omy,” Ms. Hu said in a financial workshop hosted by the
European Union at the Shanghai World Expo. “But large fluctu-
ation in foreign-exchange rates is harmful.” 
She said the sharp depreciation of the euro in the past few
months hurt confidence in the financial market and created
uncertainties for the global economy.

Moves” by Joy C. Shaw and Esther Fung. Copyright 2010 by Dow Jones &

As we indicate in the text, most economies in the world operate with
flexible exchange rates so that the value of a dollar relative to the euro,
for example, is set in the market and reflects the underlying markets for
goods and services. One exception among the major trading countries
has been China, whose government has acted to keep the value of its
currency, the yuan, stable and relatively low. An undervalued yuan, of
course, increases demand for Chinese goods from abroad, but it also
hurts the Chinese population by making foreign goods more expen-
sive. In the late spring of 2010, after much pressure from its trading
partners, the Chinese government announced that it would make the
yuan more flexible. The article below provides the views of one central
banker in China on this move. Notice the link in Ms. Hu’s discussion to
China’s current account position.
How does the J curve come about? Recall that the balance of trade is equal to export revenue
minus import costs, including exports and imports of services:
A currency depreciation affects the items on the right side of this equation as follows: First, the
quantity of exports increases and the quantity of imports decreases; both have a positive effect on the
balance of trade (lowering the trade deficit or raising the trade surplus). Second, the dollar price of
exports is not likely to change very much, at least not initially. The dollar price of exports changes
- dollar price of imports * quantity of imports
balance of trade = dollar price of exports * quantity of exports

CHAPTER 35
Open-Economy Macroeconomics: The Balance of Payments and Exchange Rates 703
when the U.S. price level changes, but the initial effect of a depreciation on the domestic price level is
not likely to be large. Third, the dollar price of imports increases. Imports into the United States are
more expensive because $1 U.S. buys fewer yen, euros, and so on, than before. An increase in the dol-
lar price of imports has a negative effect on the balance of trade.
An example to clarify this last point follows: The dollar price of a Japanese car that costs
1,200,000 yen rises from $10,000 to $12,000 when the exchange rate moves from 120 yen per
dollar to 100 yen per dollar. After the currency depreciation, the United States ends up spend-
ing more (in dollars) for the Japanese car than it did before. Of course, the United States will
end up buying fewer Japanese cars than it did before. Does the number of cars drop enough so
that the quantity effect is bigger than the price effect or vice versa? Does the value of imports
increase or decrease?
The net effect of a depreciation on the balance of trade could go either way. The depre-
ciation stimulates exports and cuts back imports, but it also increases the dollar price of
imports. It seems that the negative effect dominates initially. The impact of a depreciation on
the price of imports is generally felt quickly, while it takes time for export and import quan-
tities to respond to price changes. In the short run, the value of imports increases more than
the value of exports, so the balance of trade worsens. The initial effect is likely to be negative,
but after exports and imports have had time to respond, the net effect turns positive. The
more elastic the demand for exports and imports, the larger the eventual improvement in the
balance of trade.
Exchange Rates and Prices
The depreciation of a country’s currency tends to
increase its price level. There are two reasons for this effect. First, when a country’s currency is
less expensive, its products are more competitive on world markets, so exports rise. In addi-
tion, domestic buyers tend to substitute domestic products for the now-more-expensive
imports. This means that planned aggregate expenditure on domestically produced goods and
services rises and that the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right. The result is a higher
price level, a higher output, or both. (You may want to draw an AS/AD diagram to verify this
outcome.) If the economy is close to capacity, the result is likely to be higher prices. Second, a
depreciation makes imported inputs more expensive. If costs increase, the aggregate supply
curve shifts to the left. If aggregate demand remains unchanged, the result is an increase in the
price level.
Monetary Policy with Flexible Exchange Rates
Let us now put everything in this
chapter together and consider what happens when monetary policy is used first to stimulate the
economy and then to contract the economy.
Suppose the economy is below full employment and the Federal Reserve (Fed) decides to
expand the money supply. The volume of reserves in the system is expanded, perhaps through
open market purchases of U.S. government securities by the Fed. The result is a decrease in
the interest rate. The lower interest rate stimulates planned investment spending and con-
sumption spending.
This added spending causes inventories to be lower than planned and aggregate output
(income) (Y) to rise, but there are two additional effects: (1) The lower interest rate has an impact
in the foreign exchange market. A lower interest rate means a lower demand for U.S. securities by
foreigners, so the demand for dollars drops. (2) U.S. investment managers will be more likely to
buy foreign securities (which are now paying relatively higher interest rates), so the supply of dol-
lars rises. Both events push down the value of the dollar.
A cheaper dollar is a good thing if the goal of the monetary expansion is to stimulate the
domestic economy because a cheaper dollar means more U.S. exports and fewer imports. If con-
sumers substitute U.S.-made goods for imports, both the added exports and the decrease in
imports mean more spending on domestic products, so the multiplier actually increases.
Now suppose inflation is a problem and the Fed wants to slow it down with tight money.
Here again, floating exchange rates help. Tight monetary policy works through a higher interest
rate. A higher interest rate lowers investment and consumption spending, reducing aggregate
expenditure, reducing output, and lowering the price level. The higher interest rate also attracts
foreign buyers into U.S. financial markets, driving up the value of the dollar, which reduces the
price of imports. The reduction in the price of imports causes a shift of the aggregate supply
curve to the right, which helps fight inflation.

Losing Monetary Policy Control
Euro Trips Amid Identity Crisis
The Wall Street Journal
After a tumultuous first six months of 2010, currency markets
head into the second half with significant question marks
about Europe continuing to dominate the outlook.
As Greece was hit with protests over austerity measures, the
European Central Bank tried to allay concerns about the euro.
During the second quarter, the euro faced its biggest
test in its relatively brief life as the Greek debt crisis
threatened to tear apart the European Union. As investors
question the viability of the common currency, the euro was
sent into a tailspin that by early June amounted to an 
11% decline against the U.S. dollar from the end of March.
At one point, the euro came within shouting distance of the
$1.18 at which it exited the first day of trading when it was
introduced in 1999.
For several weeks in June, the euro rebounded following
belated but still significant steps by the European Central
Bank and European governments to help Greece avoid
default and provide some support for other heavily indebted
countries. But in the final days of the quarter the euro col-
lapsed anew, ending the second quarter at $1.2386, down
8.3% since the end of March and off 18% from an all-time
high of $1.5144 hit just last November. 
Few in the currency market believe the coast is clear 
for Europe.
Investors remain skeptical of European countries’ abili-
ties to solve budget-deficit woes in a slow-growth environ-
ment. In addition, the crisis showed cracks in the basic
structure of the European Union when it came to fiscal poli-
cies, solutions to which will require agreement among the
bloc’s fractious governments.

Crisis” by Tom Lauricella. Copyright 2010 by Dow Jones & Company,

In 1999 the European Central Bank (ECB) was created and a common
currency for much of Europe, the euro, was introduced. Countries
across Europe, from Germany and France to Italy, Spain, and
Portugal, dismantled their own monetary authorities, turning their
central banks into research institutions, and ceded control over mon-
etary policy to the ECB.
As the article below suggests, the recession that began in 2008
has proven to be a tough test for the ECB as it has tried to fashion
monetary policy for a set of nations whose economies differ in
many ways, including fiscal discipline. With a common currency,
problems with Greek debt (no longer denominated in drachma,
but in euros) have substantial effects on stronger economies 
like Germany’s.
Fiscal Policy with Flexible Exchange Rates
The openness of the economy and flexi-
ble exchange rates do not always work to the advantage of policy makers. Consider a policy of
cutting taxes to stimulate the economy. Suppose Congress enacts a major tax cut designed to raise
output. Spending by households rises, but not all this added spending is on domestic products—
some leaks out of the U.S. economy, reducing the multiplier.
As income rises, so does the demand for money (Md)—not the demand for dollars in the for-
eign exchange market, but the amount of money people want to hold for transactions. Unless the
Fed is fully accommodating, the interest rate will rise. A higher interest rate tends to attract for-
eign demand for U.S. securities. This rise in demand tends to drive the price of the dollar up,
which further blunts the effectiveness of the tax cut. If the value of the dollar rises, U.S. exports
are less competitive in world markets and the quantity of exports will decline. Similarly, a strong
dollar makes imported goods look cheaper and U.S. citizens spend more on foreign goods and
less on U.S. goods, an effect that again reduces the multiplier.
There is another caveat to the multiplier story of Chapters 23 and 24. Without a fully accom-
modating Fed, three factors work to reduce the multiplier: (1) A higher interest rate from the
increase in money demand may crowd out private investment and consumption; (2) some of the

CHAPTER 35
Open-Economy Macroeconomics: The Balance of Payments and Exchange Rates 705
increase in income from the expansion will be spent on imports; and (3) a higher interest rate
may cause the dollar to appreciate, discouraging exports and further encouraging imports.
Monetary Policy with Fixed Exchange Rates
Although most major countries in the
world today have a flexible exchange rate (counting for this purpose the euro zone countries as one
country), it is interesting to ask what role monetary policy can play when a country has a fixed
exchange rate. The answer is, no role. For a country to keep its exchange rate fixed to, say, the U.S.
dollar, its interest rate cannot change relative to the U.S. interest rate. If the monetary authority of
the country lowered the interest rate because it wanted to stimulate the economy, the country’s
currency would depreciate (assuming the U.S. interest rate did not change). People would want to
sell the country’s currency and buy dollars and invest in U.S. securities because the country’s inter-
est rate would have fallen relative to the U.S. interest rate. In other words, the monetary authority
cannot change its interest rate relative to the U.S. interest rate without having its exchange rate
change. The monetary authority is at the mercy of the United States, and it has no independent
way of changing its interest rate if it wants to keep its exchange rate fixed to the dollar.
When the various European countries moved in 1999 to a common currency, the euro, each
country gave up its monetary policy.Monetary policy is decided for all of the euro zone countries by
the European Central Bank (ECB). The Bank of Italy, for example, no longer has any influence over
Italian interest rates. Interest rates are influenced by the ECB. This is the price Italy paid for giving
up the lira. See the Economics in Practice,“Losing Monetary Policy Control,”on p. 704 for problems
that may arise when there is a common currency.
The one case in which a country can change its interest rate and keep its exchange rate fixed
is if it imposes capital controls. Imposing capital controls means that the country limits or pre-
vents people from buying or selling its currency in the foreign exchange markets. A citizen of the
country may be prevented, for example, from using the country’s currency to buy dollars. The
problem with capital controls is that they are hard to enforce, especially for large countries and for
long periods of time.
An Interdependent World Economy
The increasing interdependence of countries in the world economy has made the problems facing
policy makers more difficult. We used to be able to think of the United States as a relatively self-
sufficient region. Forty years ago economic events outside U.S. borders had relatively little effect on
its economy. This situation is no longer true. The events of the past four decades have taught us
that the performance of the U.S. economy is heavily dependent on events outside U.S. borders.
This chapter and the previous chapter have provided only the bare bones of open-economy
macroeconomics. If you continue your study of economics, more will be added to the basic story we
have presented.The next chapter concludes with a discussion of the problems of developing countries.
EQUILIBRIUM OUTPUT (INCOME) IN AN OPEN
ECONOMY p. 692
4. In an open economy, some income is spent on foreign pro-
duced goods instead of domestically produced goods. To
measure planned domestic aggregate expenditure in an open
economy, we add total exports but subtract total imports:
C + I + G + EX - IM. The open economy is in equilibrium
when domestic aggregate output (income) (Y) equals
planned domestic aggregate expenditure.
5. In an open economy, the multiplier equals 1/[1 - (MPC -
MPM)], where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume
and MPM is the marginal propensity to import. The
marginal propensity to import is the change in imports
caused by a $1 change in income.
S U M M A R Y
1. The main difference between an international transaction
and a domestic transaction concerns currency exchange:
When people in different countries buy from and sell to each
other, an exchange of currencies must also take place.
2. The exchange rate is the price of one country’s currency in
terms of another country’s currency.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS p. 688
3. Foreign exchange is all currencies other than the domestic
currency of a given country. The record of a nation’s transac-
tions in goods, services, and assets with the rest of the world
is its balance of payments. The balance of payments is also
the record of a country’s sources (supply) and uses
(demand) of foreign exchange.

706
PART VII
The World Economy  
6. In addition to income, other factors that affect the level of
imports are the after-tax real wage rate, after-tax nonlabor
income, interest rates, and relative prices of domestically
produced and foreign-produced goods. The demand for
exports is determined by economic activity in the rest of the
world and by relative prices.
7. An increase in U.S. economic activity leads to a worldwide
increase in economic activity, which then “feeds back” to the
United States. An increase in U.S. imports increases other
countries’ exports, which stimulates economies and increases
their imports, which increases U.S. exports, which stimulates
the U.S. economy and increases its imports, and so on. This
is the trade feedback effect.
8. Export prices of other countries affect U.S. import prices.
The general rate of inflation abroad is likely to affect U.S.
import prices. If the inflation rate abroad is high, U.S.
import prices are likely to rise.
9. Because one country’s exports are another country’s imports,
an increase in export prices increases other countries’ import
prices. An increase in other countries’ import prices leads to an
increase in their domestic prices—and their export prices. In
short, export prices affect import prices and vice versa. This
price feedback effect shows that inflation is “exportable”; an
increase in the price level in one country can drive up prices in
other countries, making inflation in the first country worse.
THE OPEN ECONOMY WITH FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE
RATES p. 696
10. The equilibrium exchange rate occurs when the quantity
demanded of a foreign currency in the foreign exchange
market equals the quantity of that currency supplied in the
foreign exchange market.
11. Depreciation of a currency occurs when a nation’s currency
falls in value relative to another country’s currency.
Appreciation of a currency occurs when a nation’s currency
rises in value relative to another country’s currency.
12. According to the law of one price, if the costs of transportation
are small, the price of the same good in different countries
should be roughly the same. The theory that exchange rates
are set so that the price of similar goods in different countries
is the same is known as the purchasing-power-parity theory. In
practice, transportation costs are significant for many goods,
and the law of one price does not hold for these goods.
13. A high rate of inflation in one country relative to another
country puts pressure on the exchange rate between the two
countries. There is a general tendency for the currencies of
relatively high-inflation countries to depreciate.
14. A depreciation of the dollar tends to increase U.S. GDP by
making U.S. exports cheaper (hence, more competitive
abroad) and by making U.S. imports more expensive
(encouraging consumers to switch to domestically produced
goods and services).
15. The effect of a depreciation of a nation’s currency on its bal-
ance of trade is unclear. In the short run, a currency deprecia-
tion may increase the balance-of-trade deficit because it raises
the price of imports. Although this price increase causes a
decrease in the quantity of imports demanded, the impact of a
depreciation on the price of imports is generally felt quickly,
but it takes time for export and import quantities to respond
to price changes. The initial effect is likely to be negative, but
after exports and imports have had time to respond, the net
effect turns positive. The tendency for the balance-of-trade
deficit to widen and then to decrease as the result of a cur-
rency depreciation is known as the J-curve effect.
16. The depreciation of a country’s currency tends to raise its
price level for two reasons. First, a currency depreciation
increases planned aggregate expenditure, an effect that shifts
the aggregate demand curve to the right. If the economy is
close to capacity, the result is likely to be higher prices.
Second, a depreciation makes imported inputs more expen-
sive. If costs increase, the aggregate supply curve shifts to the
left. If aggregate demand remains unchanged, the result is an
increase in the price level.
17. When exchange rates are flexible, a U.S. expansionary mone-
tary policy decreases the interest rate and stimulates planned
investment and consumption spending. The lower interest
rate leads to a lower demand for U.S. securities by foreigners
and a higher demand for foreign securities by U.S. invest-
ment-fund managers. As a result, the dollar depreciates. A
U.S. contractionary monetary policy appreciates the dollar.
18. Flexible exchange rates do not always work to the advantage
of policy makers. An expansionary fiscal policy can appreci-
ate the dollar and work to reduce the multiplier.

3. Obtain a recent issue of The Economist. Turn to the section entitled
“Financial Indicators.”Look at the table entitled “Trade, exchange
rates and budgets.”Which country had the largest trade deficit
over the last year and during the last month? Which country had
the largest trade surplus over the last year and during the last
month? How does the current account deficit/surplus compare to
the overall trade balance? How can you explain the difference?
4. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen
is floating freely—both governments do not intervene in the
market for each currency. Suppose a large trade deficit with
Japan prompts the United States to impose quotas on certain
Japanese products imported into the United States and, as a
result, the quantity of these imports falls.
a. The decrease in spending on Japanese products increases
spending on U.S.-made goods. Why? What effect will this
have on U.S. output and employment and on Japanese out-
put and employment?
b. What happens to U.S. imports from Japan when U.S. output
(or income) rises? If the quotas initially reduce imports from
Japan by $25 billion, why is the final reduction in imports
likely to be less than $25 billion?
c. Suppose the quotas do succeed in reducing imports from Japan
by $15 billion.What will happen to the demand for yen? Why?
d. What will happen to the dollar–yen exchange rate? Why?
(Hint: There is an excess supply of yen, or an excess demand
for dollars.) What effects will the change in the value of each
currency have on employment and output in the United
States? What about the balance of trade? (Ignore complica-
tions such as the J curve.)
e. Considering the macroeconomic effects of a quota on
Japanese imports, could a quota reduce employment and
output in the United States? have no effect at all? Explain.
5. What effect will each of the following events have on the current
account balance and the exchange rate if the exchange rate is
fixed? if the exchange rate is floating?
a. The U.S. government cuts taxes and income rises.
b. The U.S. inflation rate increases, and prices in the United
States rise faster than those in countries with which the
United States trades.
c. The United States adopts an expansionary monetary policy.
Interest rates fall (and are now lower than those in other
countries) and income rises.
d. The textile companies’“Buy American” campaign is success-
ful, and U.S. consumers switch from purchasing imported
products to buying products made in the United States.
6. You are given the following model that describes the economy
of Hypothetica.
(1) Consumption function: C = 100 + .8Yd
(2) Planned investment: I = 38
(3) Government spending: G = 75
(4) Exports: EX = 25
(5) Imports: IM = .05 Yd
(6) Disposable income: Yd  Y - T
(7) Taxes: T = 40
(8) Planned aggregate expenditure:
AE  C + I + G + EX - IM
(9) Definition of equilibrium income: Y = AE
a. What is equilibrium income in Hypothetica? What is the
government deficit? What is the current account balance?
b. If government spending is increased to G = 80, what hap-
pens to equilibrium income? Explain using the government
spending multiplier. What happens to imports?
c. Now suppose the amount of imports is limited to IM = 40
by a quota on imports. If government spending is again
increased from 75 to 80, what happens to equilibrium
income? Explain why the same increase in G has a bigger
effect on income in the second case. What is it about the
presence of imports that changes the value of the multiplier?
d. If exports are fixed at EX = 25, what must income be to
ensure a current account balance of zero? (Hint: Imports
depend on income, so what must income be for imports to
be equal to exports?) By how much must we cut government
spending to balance the current account? (Hint: Use your
answer to the first part of this question to determine how
much of a decrease in income is needed. Then use the multi-
plier to calculate the decrease in G needed to reduce income
by that amount.)

CHAPTER 35 APPENDIX
World Monetary Systems Since 1900
Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the world has
operated under a number of different monetary systems. This
Appendix provides a brief history of each and a description of
how they worked.
The Gold Standard
The gold standard was the major system of exchange rate
determination before 1914. All currencies were priced in
terms of gold—an ounce of gold was worth so much in each
currency. When all currencies exchanged at fixed ratios to
gold, exchange rates could be determined easily. For
instance, 1 ounce of gold was worth $20 U.S.; that same
ounce of gold exchanged for £4 (British pounds). Because
$20 and £4 were each worth 1 ounce of gold, the exchange
rate between dollars and pounds was $20/£4, or $5 to £1.
For the gold standard to be effective, it had to be backed
up by the country’s willingness to buy and sell gold at the
determined price. As long as countries maintain their
currencies at a fixed value in terms of gold and as long as
each country is willing to buy and sell gold, exchange rates
are fixed. If at the given exchange rate the number of U.S.
citizens who want to buy things produced in Great Britain is
equal to the number of British citizens who want to buy
things produced in the United States, the currencies of the
two countries will simply be exchanged. What if U.S. citi-
zens suddenly decide they want to drink imported Scotch
instead of domestic bourbon? If the British do not have an
increased desire for U.S. goods, they will still accept U.S.
dollars because those dollars can be redeemed in gold. This
gold can then be immediately turned into pounds.
As long as a country’s overall balance of payments remained
in balance, no gold would enter or leave the country and the
economy would be in equilibrium. If U.S. citizens bought more
from the British than the British bought from the United States,
however, the U.S. balance of payments would be in deficit and
the U.S. stock of gold would begin to fall. Conversely, Britain
would start to accumulate gold because it would be exporting
more than it spent on imports.

CHAPTER 35
Open-Economy Macroeconomics: The Balance of Payments and Exchange Rates 709
1 In the days when currencies were tied to gold, changes in the amount of gold
influenced the supply of money in two ways. A change in the quantity of gold coins
in circulation had a direct effect on the supply of money; indirectly, gold served as a
backing for paper currency. A decrease in the central bank’s gold holdings meant a
decline in the amount of paper money that could be supported.
Under the gold standard, gold was a big determinant of
the money supply.1 An inflow of gold into a country caused
that country’s money supply to expand, and an outflow of
gold caused that country’s money supply to contract. If gold
were flowing from the United States to Great Britain, the
British money supply would expand and the U.S. money sup-
ply would contract.
Now recall from earlier chapters the impacts of a
change in the money supply. An expanded money supply in
Britain will lower British interest rates and stimulate aggre-
gate demand. As a result, aggregate output (income) and the
price level in Britain will increase. Higher British prices will
discourage U.S. citizens from buying British goods. At the
same time, British citizens will have more income and will
face relatively lower import prices, causing them to import
more from the States.
On the other side of the Atlantic, U.S. citizens will face
a contracting domestic money supply. This will cause
higher interest rates, declining aggregate demand, lower
prices, and falling output (income). The effect will be lower
demand in the United States for British goods. Thus,
changes in relative prices and incomes that resulted from
the inflow and outflow of gold would automatically bring
trade back into balance.
Problems with the Gold Standard
Two major problems were associated with the gold standard.
First, the gold standard implied that a country had little con-
trol over its money supply. The reason, as we have just seen, is
that the money stock increased when the overall balance of
payments was in surplus (gold inflow) and decreased when
the overall balance was in deficit (gold outflow). A country
that was experiencing a balance-of-payments deficit could
correct the problem only by the painful process of allowing its
money supply to contract. This contraction brought on a
slump in economic activity, a slump that would eventually
restore balance-of-payments equilibrium, but only after
reductions in income and employment. Countries could (and
often did) act to protect their gold reserves, and this precau-
tionary step prevented the adjustment mechanism from cor-
recting the deficit.
Making the money supply depend on the amount of gold
available had another disadvantage. When major new gold
fields were discovered (as in California in 1849 and South
Africa in 1886), the world’s supply of gold (and therefore of
money) increased. The price level rose and income increased.
When no new gold was discovered, the supply of money
remained unchanged and prices and income tended to fall.
When President Reagan took office in 1981, he established
a commission to consider returning the nation to the gold
standard. The final commission report recommended against
such a move. An important part of the reasoning behind this
recommendation was that the gold standard puts enormous
economic power in the hands of gold-producing nations.
Fixed Exchange Rates and the Bretton
Woods System
As World War II drew to a close, a group of economists from
the United States and Europe met to formulate a new set of
rules for exchange rate determination that they hoped would
avoid the difficulties of the gold standard. The rules they
designed became known as the Bretton Woods system, after the
town in New Hampshire where the delegates met. The Bretton
Woods system was based on two (not necessarily compatible)
premises. First, countries were to maintain fixed exchange
rates with one another. Instead of pegging their currencies
directly to gold, however, currencies were fixed in terms of the
U.S. dollar, which was fixed in value at $35 per ounce of gold.
The British pound, for instance, was fixed at roughly $2.40, so
that an ounce of gold was worth approximately £14.6. As we
shall see, the pure system of fixed exchange rates would work
in a manner very similar to the pre-1914 gold standard.
The second aspect of the Bretton Woods system added a
new wrinkle to the operation of the international economy.
Countries experiencing a “fundamental disequilibrium” in
their balance of payments were allowed to change their
exchange rates. (The term fundamental disequilibrium was nec-
essarily vague, but it came to be interpreted as a large and per-
sistent current account deficit.) Exchange rates were not really
fixed under the Bretton Woods system; they were, as someone
remarked, only “fixed until further notice.”
The point of allowing countries with serious current
account problems to alter the value of their currency was to
avoid the harsh recessions that the operation of the gold stan-
dard would have produced under these circumstances.
However, the experience of the European economies in the
years between World War I and World War II suggested that it
might not be a good idea to give countries complete freedom
to change their exchange rates whenever they wanted.
During the Great Depression, many countries under-
took so-called competitive devaluations to protect domestic
output and employment. That is, countries would try to
encourage exports—a source of output growth and
employment—by attempting to set as low an exchange rate
as possible, thereby making their exports competitive with
foreign-produced goods. Unfortunately, such policies had a
built-in flaw. A devaluation of the pound against the French
franc might help encourage British exports to France, but if
those additional British exports cut into French output and
employment, France would likely respond by devaluing the
franc against the pound, a move that, of course, would
undo the effects of the pound’s initial devaluation.
To solve this exchange rate rivalry, the Bretton Woods
agreement created the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its
job was to assist countries experiencing temporary current

account problems.2 It was also supposed to certify that a “fun-
damental disequilibrium” existed before a country was allowed
to change its exchange rate. The IMF was like an international
economic traffic cop whose job was to ensure that all countries
were playing the game according to the agreed-to rules and to
provide emergency assistance where needed.
“Pure” Fixed Exchange Rates
Under a pure fixed exchange rate system, governments set a
particular fixed rate at which their currencies will exchange for
one another and then commit themselves to maintaining that
rate. A true fixed exchange rate system is like the gold standard
in that exchange rates are supposed to stay the same forever.
Because currencies are no longer backed by gold, they have 
no fixed, or standard, value relative to one another. There is,
therefore, no automatic mechanism to keep exchange rates
aligned with each other, as with the gold standard.
The result is that under a pure fixed exchange rate system,
governments must at times intervene in the foreign exchange
market to keep currencies aligned at their established values.
Economists define government intervention in the foreign
exchange market as the buying or selling of foreign exchange
for the purpose of manipulating the exchange rate. What kind
of intervention is likely to occur under a fixed exchange rate
system, and how does it work?
We can see how intervention works by looking at 
Figure 35A.1. Initially, the market for Australian dollars is in
equilibrium. At the fixed exchange rate of 0.96, the supply of
dollars is exactly equal to the demand for dollars. No govern-
ment intervention is necessary to maintain the exchange rate at
this level. Now suppose Australian wines are found to be cont-
aminated with antifreeze and U.S. citizens switch to California
wines. This substitution away from the Australian product
shifts the U.S. demand curve for Australian dollars to the left:
The United States demands fewer Australian dollars at every
exchange rate (cost of an Australian dollar) because it is pur-
chasing less from Australia than it did before.
If the price of Australian dollars were set in a completely
unfettered market, the shift in the demand curve would lead to
a fall in the price of Australian dollars, just the way the price of
wheat would fall if there was an excess supply of wheat.
Remember, the Australian and U.S. governments have commit-
ted themselves to maintaining the rate at 0.96. To do so, either
the U.S. government or the Australian government (or both)
must buy up the excess supply of Australian dollars to keep its
price from falling. In essence, the fixed exchange rate policy
commits governments to making up any difference between the
supply of a currency and the demand so as to keep the price of
the currency (exchange rate) at the desired level. The govern-
ment promises to act as the supplier (or demander) of last
resort, who will ensure that the amount of foreign exchange
demanded by the private sector will equal the supply at the
fixed price.
Problems with the Bretton Woods System
As it developed after the end of World War II, the system of
more-or-less fixed exchange rates had some flaws that led to its
abandonment in 1971.
First, there was a basic asymmetry built into the rules of
international finance. Countries experiencing large and persis-
tent current account deficits—what the Bretton Woods agree-
ments termed “fundamental disequilibria”—were obliged to
devalue their currencies and/or take measures to cut their
deficits by contracting their economies. Both of these alterna-
tives were unpleasant because devaluation meant rising prices
and contraction meant rising unemployment. However, a
country with a current account deficit had no choice because it
was losing stock of foreign exchange reserves. When its stock of
foreign currencies became exhausted, it had to change its
exchange rate because further intervention (selling off some of
its foreign exchange reserves) became impossible.
Countries experiencing current account surpluses were
in a different position because they were gaining foreign
exchange reserves. Although these countries were supposed
to stimulate their economies and/or revalue their currencies
to restore balance to their current account, they were not
obliged to do so. They could easily maintain their fixed
exchange rate by buying up any excess supply of foreign
exchange with their own currency, of which they had plenti-
ful supply.
In practice, this meant that some countries—especially
Germany and Japan—tended to run large and chronic current
account surpluses and were under no compulsion to take steps
to correct the problem. The U.S. economy, stimulated 
by expenditures on the Vietnam War, experienced a large and
2 The idea was that the IMF would make short-term loans to a country with a cur-
rent account deficit. The loans would enable the country to correct the current
account problem gradually, without bringing on a deep recession, running out of
foreign exchange reserves, or devaluing the currency.

CHAPTER 35
Open-Economy Macroeconomics: The Balance of Payments and Exchange Rates 711
prolonged current account deficit (capital outflow) in 
the 1960s, which was the counterpart of these surpluses. The
United States was, however, in a unique position under 
the Bretton Woods system. The value of gold was fixed in terms
of the U.S. dollar at $35 per ounce of gold. Other countries
fixed their exchange rates in terms of U.S. dollars (and there-
fore only indirectly in terms of gold). Consequently, the United
States could never accomplish anything by devaluing its cur-
rency in terms of gold. If the dollar was devalued from $35 to
$40 per ounce of gold, the yen, pegged at 200 yen per dollar,
would move in parallel with the dollar (from 7,000 yen per
ounce of gold to 8,000 yen per ounce), with the dollar–yen
exchange rate unaffected. To correct its current account deficits
vis-à-vis Japan and Germany, it would be necessary for those
two countries to adjust their currencies’ exchange rates with
the dollar. These countries were reluctant to do so for a variety
of reasons. As a result, the U.S. current account was chronically
in deficit throughout the late 1960s.
A second flaw in the Bretton Woods system was that it per-
mitted devaluations only when a country had a “chronic” cur-
rent account deficit and was in danger of running out of foreign
exchange reserves. This meant that devaluations could often be
predicted quite far in advance, and they usually had to be rather
large if they were to correct any serious current account prob-
lem. The situation made it tempting for speculators to “attack”
the currencies of countries with current account deficits.
Problems such as these eventually led the United States
to abandon the Bretton Woods rules in 1971. The U.S. gov-
ernment refused to continue pegging the value of the dollar
in terms of gold. Thus, the prices of all currencies were free
to find their own levels.
The alternative to fixed exchange rates is a system that
allows exchange rates to move freely or flexibly in response to
market forces. Two types of flexible exchange rate systems are
usually distinguished. In a freely floating system, governments
do not intervene at all in the foreign exchange market.3 They
do not buy or sell currencies with the aim of manipulating the
rates. In a managed floating system, governments intervene if
markets are becoming “disorderly”—fluctuating more than a
government believes is desirable. Governments may also
intervene if they think a currency is increasing or decreasing
too much in value even though the day-to-day fluctuations
may be small.
Since the demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1971,
the world’s exchange rate system can be described as “man-
aged floating.” One of the important features of this system
has been times of large fluctuations in exchange rates. For
example, the yen–dollar rate went from 347 in 1971 to 210
in 1978, to 125 in 1988, and to 80 in 1995. Those are very
large changes, changes that have important effects on the
international economy, some of which we have covered in
this text.
3 However, governments may from time to time buy or sell foreign exchange for
their own needs (instead of influencing the exchange rate). For example, the U.S.
government might need British pounds to buy land for a U.S. embassy building in
London. For our purposes, we ignore this behavior because it is not “intervention”
in the strict sense of the word.
1. The gold standard was the major system of exchange rate
determination before 1914. All currencies were priced in
terms of gold. Difficulties with the gold standard led to the
Bretton Woods agreement following World War II. Under
this system, countries maintained fixed exchange rates with
one another and fixed the value of their currencies in terms
of the U.S. dollar. Countries experiencing a “fundamental
disequilibrium” in their current accounts were permitted to
change their exchange rates.
2. The Bretton Woods system was abandoned in 1971. Since
then, the world’s exchange rate system has been one of man-
aged floating rates. Under this system, governments inter-
vene if foreign exchange markets are fluctuating more than
the government thinks desirable.

Our primary focus in this text has
been on countries with modern
industrialized economies that rely
heavily on markets to allocate
resources, but what about the eco-
nomic problems facing countries
such as Somalia and Haiti? Can we
apply the same economic princi-
ples that we have been studying to
these less developed nations?
Yes. All economic analysis deals
with the problem of making choices
under conditions of scarcity, and
the problem of satisfying people’s
wants and needs is as real for Somalia and Haiti as it is for the United States, Germany, and
Japan. The universality of scarcity is what makes economic analysis relevant to all nations,
regardless of their level of material well-being or ruling political ideology.
The basic tools of supply and demand, theories about consumers and firms, and theories
about the structure of markets all contribute to an understanding of the economic problems con-
fronting the world’s developing nations. However, these nations often face economic problems
quite different from those that richer, more developed countries face. In developing nations, an
economist may have to worry about chronic food shortages, explosive population growth, and
hyperinflations that reach triple, and even quadruple, digits. The United States and other indus-
trialized economies rarely encounter such difficulties.
The instruments of economic management also vary from nation to nation. The United
States has well-developed financial market institutions and a strong central bank (the Federal
Reserve) through which the government can control the macroeconomy to some extent. Even
limited intervention is impossible in some of the developing countries. In the United States, tax
laws can be changed to stimulate saving, to encourage particular kinds of investments, or to redis-
tribute income. In most developing countries, there are neither meaningful personal income
taxes nor effective tax policies.

PART VII
The World Economy 
Even though economic problems and the policy instruments available to tackle them
vary across nations, economic thinking about these problems can be transferred easily from
one setting to another. In this chapter, we discuss several of the economic problems specific
to developing nations in an attempt to capture some of the insights that economic analysis
can offer.
Life in the Developing Nations: Population
and Poverty
In 2010, the population of the world reached over 6.8 billion people. Most of the world’s more
than 200 nations belong to the developing world, in which about three-fourths of the world’s
population lives.
In the early 1960s, the nations of the world could be assigned rather easily to categories:
The developed countries included most of Europe, North America, Japan, Australia, and New
Zealand; the developing countries included the rest of the world. The developing nations were
often referred to as the Third World to distinguish them from the Western industrialized
nations (the First World) and the former Socialist bloc of Eastern European nations (the
Second World).
In 2010, the world did not divide easily into three neat parts. Rapid economic progress
brought some developing nations closer to developed economies. Countries such as Argentina
and Chile, still considered to be “developing,” are often referred to as middle-income or newly
industrialized countries. Other countries, such as those in much of sub-Saharan Africa and
some in South Asia, have stagnated and fallen so far behind the economic advances of the rest
of the world that the term Fourth World has been used to describe them. China and India, while
usually labeled developing countries, are fast becoming economic superpowers. It is not clear
yet where some of the republics of the former Soviet Union and other formerly Communist
countries of Eastern Europe will end up. Production fell sharply in many of them in the early
transition stage to a market economy. Post-2000, however, the Russian economy began grow-
ing more rapidly.
Although the countries of the developing world exhibit considerable diversity in both
their standards of living and their particular experiences of growth, marked differences
continue to separate them from the developed nations. The developed countries have a
higher average level of material well-being (the amount of food, clothing, shelter, and other
commodities consumed by the average person). Comparisons of gross national income
(GNI) are often used as a crude index of the level of material well-being across nations. GNI
is a new measure of a nation’s income, computed using a more accurate way of converting
purchasing power into dollars. See Table 36.1, where GNI per-capita in the industrial

market economies significantly exceeds GNI of both the low- and middle-income develop-
ing economies.
Other characteristics of economic development include improvements in basic health
and education. The degree of political and economic freedom enjoyed by individual citizens
might also be part of what it means to be a developed nation. Some of these criteria are easy
to quantify. Table 36.1 presents data for different types of economies according to some of
the more easily measured indexes of development. As you can see, the industrial market
economies enjoy higher standards of living according to whatever indicator of development
is chosen.
Behind these statistics lies the reality of the very difficult life facing the people of the
developing world. For most people, meager incomes provide only the basic necessities. Many
people share a small room, usually with an earthen floor and no sanitary facilities. The great
majority of the population lives in rural areas where agricultural work is hard and extremely
time-consuming. Productivity (output produced per worker) is low because household plots
are small and only the crudest of farm implements are available. Low productivity means
farm output per person is barely sufficient to feed a farmer’s own family. School-age children
may receive some formal education, but illiteracy remains chronic for young and old. Infant
mortality runs 20 times higher than in the United States. Although parasitic infections are
common and debilitating, there is only one physician per 5,000 people. In addition, many
developing nations are engaged in civil and external warfare.
Life in the developing nations is a continual struggle against the circumstances of poverty,
and prospects for dramatic improvements in living standards for most people are dim. As with all
generalizations, there are exceptions. Some nations are better off than others, and in any given
nation an elite group always lives in considerable luxury. India is on the World Bank’s list of low-
income countries, yet Mumbai, a state capital, is one of the top 10 centers of commerce in the
world, home to Bollywood, the world’s largest film industry.
Poverty—not affluence—dominates the developing world. Recent studies suggest that
40 percent of the population of the developing nations has an annual income insufficient to
provide for adequate nutrition. While the developed nations account for only about one-
quarter of the world’s population, they are estimated to consume three-quarters of the
world’s output. This leaves the developing countries with about three-fourths of the world’s
people but only one-fourth of the world’s income. The simple result is that most of our
planet’s population is poor.
In the United States in 2005, the poorest one-fifth (bottom 20 percent) of the families
received 3.4 percent of total income; the richest one-fifth received 50 percent. Inequality in the
world distribution of income is much greater. When we look at the world population, the poorest
one-fifth of the families earns about .5 percent and the richest one-fifth earns 79 percent of total
world income.
Economic Development: Sources and
Strategies
Economists have been trying to understand economic growth and development since Adam
Smith and David Ricardo in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but the study of develop-
ment economics as it applies to the developing nations has a much shorter history. The geopolit-
ical struggles that followed World War II brought increased attention to the developing nations
and their economic problems. During this period, the new field of development economics
asked simply: Why are some nations poor and others rich? If economists could understand the
barriers to economic growth that prevent nations from developing and the prerequisites that
would help them to develop, economists could prescribe strategies for achieving economic
advancement.

716
PART VII
The World Economy 
The Sources of Economic Development
Although a general theory of economic development applicable to all nations has not emerged,
some basic factors that limit a poor nation’s economic growth have been suggested. These include
insufficient capital formation, a shortage of human resources and entrepreneurial ability, and a
lack of social overhead capital.
Capital Formation
One explanation for low levels of output in developing nations 
is insufficient quantities of necessary inputs. Developing nations have diverse resource
endowments—Congo, for instance, is abundant in natural resources, while Bangladesh is
resource-poor. Almost all developing nations have a scarcity of capital relative to other
resources, especially labor. The small stock of physical capital (factories, machinery, farm
equipment, and other productive capital) constrains labor’s productivity and holds back
national output.
Nevertheless, citing capital shortages as the cause of low productivity does not explain much.
We need to know why capital is in such short supply in developing countries. There are many
explanations. One, the vicious-circle-of-poverty hypothesis, suggests that a poor nation must
consume most of its income just to maintain its already low standard of living. Consuming most
of national income implies limited saving, and this implies low levels of investment. Without
investment, the capital stock does not grow, the income remains low, and the vicious circle is
complete. Poverty becomes self-perpetuating.
The difficulty with the vicious-circle argument is that if it were true, no nation would
ever develop. Japanese GDP per capita in 1900 was well below that of many of today’s
developing nations, yet today it is among the affluent, developed nations. Among the many
nations with low levels of capital per capita, some—like China—have managed to grow and
develop in the last 20 years, while others remain behind. In even the poorest countries, there
remains some capital surplus that could be harnessed if conditions were right. Many current
observers believe that scarcity of capital in some developing countries may have more to 
do with a lack of incentives for citizens to save and invest productively than with 
any absolute scarcity of income available for capital accumulation. Many of the rich in
developing countries invest their savings in Europe or in the United States instead of in their
own country, which may have a riskier political climate. Savings transferred to the United
States do not lead to physical capital growth in the developing countries. The term capital
flight refers to the fact that both human capital and financial capital (domestic savings)
leave developing countries in search of higher expected rates of return elsewhere or 
returns with less risk. Government policies in the developing nations—including price ceil-
ings, import controls, and even outright appropriation of private property—tend to discour-
age investment. There has been increased attention to the role that financial institutions,
including accounting systems and property right rules, play in encouraging domestic 
capital formation.
Whatever the causes of capital shortages, it is clear that the absence of productive capital pre-
vents income from rising in any economy. The availability of capital is a necessary, but not a
sufficient, condition for economic growth. The landscape of the developing countries is littered
with idle factories and abandoned machinery. Other ingredients are required to achieve eco-
nomic progress.
Human Resources and Entrepreneurial Ability
Capital is not the only factor of
production required to produce output. Labor is equally important. First of all, to be produc-
tive, the workforce must be healthy. Disease today is the leading threat to development in much
of the world. In 2009, more than 1 million people died of malaria, almost all of them in Africa.
The Gates Foundation has targeted malaria eradication as one of its key goals in the next decade.

CHAPTER 36
Economic Growth in Developing and Transitional Economies 717
HIV/AIDS was still responsible for more than 2 million deaths in 2009, again mostly in Africa,
and has left Africa with more than 14 million AIDS orphans. Iron deficiency and parasites sap
the strength of many workers in the developing world.
Health is not the only issue. Look back at Table 36.1 You will notice that low-income
countries lag behind high-income countries not only in health but also in literacy rates.
To be productive, the workforce must be educated and trained. Basic literacy as well as
specialized training in farm management, for example, can yield high returns to both 
the individual worker and the economy. Education has grown to become the largest category
of government expenditure in many developing nations, in part because of the belief
that human resources are the ultimate determinant of economic advance. Nevertheless,
in many developing countries, many children, especially girls, receive only a few years of for-
mal education.
Just as financial capital seeks the highest and safest return, so does human capital.
Thousands of students from developing countries, many of whom were supported by their
governments, graduate every year from U.S. colleges and universities. After graduation, these
people face a difficult choice: to remain in the United States and earn a high salary or to
return home and accept a job at a much lower salary. Many remain in the United States. This
brain drain siphons off many of the most talented minds from developing countries.
It is interesting to look at what happens to the flow of educated workers as countries
develop. Increasingly, students who have come from China and India to study are returning
to their home countries eager to use their skills in their newly growing economies. The
return flow of this human capital stimulates growth and is a signal that growth is occurring.
Indeed, development economists have found evidence that in India, schooling choices made
by parents for their children respond quite strongly to changes in employment opportuni-
ties.1 The connection between growth and human capital is in fact a two-way street.
Even when educated workers leave for the developed world, they may contribute to the
growth of their home country. Recently, economists have begun studying remittances, com-
pensation sent back from recent immigrants to their families in less developed countries.
While measurement is difficult, estimates of these remittances are approximately $100 billion
per year. Remittances fund housing and education for families left behind, but they also can
provide investment capital for small businesses. In 2007, it appeared that remittances from
illegal immigrants in the United States to Mexico, which had been growing by 20 percent per
year, were beginning to fall with tightening of enforcement of immigration rules. Remittances
fell further in 2008–2009 with the recession.
In recent years, we have become increasingly aware of the role of entrepreneurship 
in economic development. Many of the iconic firms in the nineteenth century that
contributed so strongly to the early industrial growth of the United States—Standard 
Oil, U.S. Steel, Carnegie Steel—were begun by entrepreneurs starting with little capital. In
China, one of the top search engines is Baidu, a firm started in 2000 by two Chinese nation-
als, Eric Xu and Robin Li, and now traded on NASDAQ. Providing opportunities and incen-
tives for creative risk takers seems to be an increasing part of what needs to be done to
promote development.
Social Overhead Capital
Anyone who has spent time in a developing nation knows
how difficult it can be to carry on everyday life. Problems with water supplies, poor roads,
frequent electrical power outages—in the few areas where electricity is available—and often
ineffective mosquito and pest control make life and commerce difficult.

ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Corruption
Many people have argued that one barrier to economic develop-
ment in a number of countries is the level of corruption and inef-
ficiency in the government. Measuring levels of corruption and
inefficiency can be difficult. Some researchers have tried surveys
and experiments. Ray Fisman1 had a more unusual way to measure
the way in which political connections interfere with the workings
of the market in Indonesia.
From 1967 to 1998, Indonesia was ruled by President Suharto.
While Suharto ruled, his children and longtime allies were affili-
ated with a number of Indonesian companies. Fisman had the
clever idea of looking at what happened to the stock market
prices of those firms connected to the Suharto clan relative to
unaffiliated firms when Suharto unexpectedly fell ill. Fisman
found a large and significant reduction in the value of those affil-
iated firms on rumors of illness. What does this tell us? A firm’s
stock price reflects investors’ views of what earnings the firm can
expect to have. In the case of firms connected to Suharto, the
decline in their stock prices tells us that a large part of the reason
investors think that those firms are doing well is because of the
family connection rather than the firm’s inherent efficiency. One
reason corruption is bad for an economy is that it often leads to
the wrong firms, the less efficient firms, producing the goods and
services in the society.
The following chart shows the World Bank’s rating of corrup-
tion levels in a number of countries around the world. The coun-
tries are ranked from those with the strongest controls on
corruption—Germany and France—to those with the lowest
controls—Pakistan and Nigeria. Indonesia, as you can see, is near
the bottom of the list.

CHAPTER 36
Economic Growth in Developing and Transitional Economies 719
In any economy, developing or otherwise, the government plays an investment role. In a
developing economy, the government must create a basic infrastructure—roads, power gen-
eration, and irrigation systems. Such projects, referred to as social overhead capital, often
cannot successfully be undertaken by the private sector. Many of these projects operate with
economies of scale, which means they can be efficient only if they are very large, perhaps too
large for any private company or group of companies to carry out. In other cases, the bene-
fits from a development project, while extraordinarily valuable, cannot be easily bought and
sold. The availability of clean air and potable water are two examples. Here government must
play its role before the private sector can proceed. For example, some observers have recently
argued that India’s growth prospects are being limited by its poor rail transport system.
Goods from Singapore to India move easily over water in less than a day, but they can take
weeks to move from port cities to supply factories in the interior. China, by contrast, spent
the bulk of its stimulus money in the 2008–2009 period trying to build new transportation
networks in part because the government understood how key this social overhead capital
was to economic growth.
To build infrastructure requires public funding. Many less developed countries struggle with
raising tax revenues to support these projects. In 2010, Greece struggled to repay its debt partly
because of widespread tax evasion by its wealthiest citizens. In many less developed countries,
corruption limits the public funds available for productive government investments, as the
Economics in Practice on p. 718 suggests.
Strategies for Economic Development
Just as no single theory appears to explain lack of economic advancement, no one develop-
ment strategy will likely succeed in all nations. How active a role should government play in
directing economic development? What sectors should be emphasized? Should one focus on
new business as a growth engine? These questions are being debated by economists and gov-
ernments across the globe.
Governments or Markets?
Soviet-style development was accomplished with
detailed central planning, state ownership, and control of prices and output. Today in devel-
oping economies, the market plays a much stronger role. In most parts of the world,
including nondemocratic countries like China, state ownership has declined and prices are
mostly set in markets. International agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
whose primary goals are to stabilize international exchange rates and to lend money to
countries with problems financing international transactions, and the World Bank,
which lends money to countries for development projects, have pushed hard for market-
oriented reforms.
Market-oriented reforms, however, have not eliminated the role of government. As indi-
cated earlier, governments play a vital role in creating institutions that allow markets to work
effectively—physical institutions like roads and schools, and business and legal institutions
such as accounting systems and property rights. Many governments also use their taxing and
expenditure policies to favor specific sectors over others as they try to grow. Industrial
policy, in which governments actively pick industries to support as a base for economic
development, is still carried on at some level in most developing nations. The greater central
control of the economy in China was very evident during the recent recession in the 
speed with which China could direct its government expenditures as it sought to stimulate
its economy.
Agriculture or Industry?
Consider the data in Table 36.2. The richest countries
listed—the United States, Japan, and Korea—generate much of their GDP in services, with
little value contributed by agricultural production. The poorest countries, on the other
hand, have substantial agricultural sectors, although as you can see, the service sector is also

In many countries, however, industrialization has been unsuccessful. Some have argued
that a move out of agriculture may be a result of development, rather than a cause. Others
have suggested that industrialization worked for the Western economies but may not work as
well for economies with other distributions of human and physical capital. Indeed, in the
last several decades the agricultural sector has received more attention as a source of eco-
nomic development. Many agricultural projects with large productivity enhancement poten-
tial have relatively low capital requirements and thus may better match the capital-poor
developing world. Agricultural development also improves the lot of the rural population,
where more of the poor typically live. Finally, improving agriculture may slow the move of
the poor to cities, where infrastructure is inadequate for the growing population.
Experience over the last three decades suggests that some balance between industrialization
and agricultural reform leads to the best outcome—that is, it is important and effective to pay
attention to both industry and agriculture. The Chinese have referred to this dual approach to
development as “walking on two legs.”
Exports or Import Substitution?
As developing nations expand their industrial
activities, they must decide what type of trade strategy to pursue. Development economists
discuss two alternatives: import substitution or export promotion.
Import substitution is a strategy used to develop local industries that can manufacture
goods to replace imports. If fertilizer is imported, import substitution calls for a domestic
fertilizer industry to produce replacements for fertilizer imports. This strategy 
gained prominence throughout South America in the 1950s. At that time, most developing
nations exported agricultural and mineral products, goods that faced uncertain and often
unstable international markets. Under these conditions, the call for import substitution
policies was understandable. Special government actions, including tariff and quota
protection and subsidized imports of machinery, were set up to encourage new domestic
industries. Multinational corporations were also invited into many countries to begin
domestic operations.

CHAPTER 36
Economic Growth in Developing and Transitional Economies 721
Most economists believe that import substitution strategies have failed almost every-
where they have been tried. With domestic industries sheltered from international competi-
tion by high tariffs (often as high as 200 percent), major economic inefficiencies were
created. For example, Peru has a population of approximately 29 million, only a tiny fraction
of whom can afford to buy an automobile. Yet at one time, the country had five or six differ-
ent automobile manufacturers, each of which produced only a few thousand cars per year.
Because there are substantial economies of scale in automobile production, the cost per car
was much higher than it needed to be, and valuable resources that could have been devoted
to another, more productive, activity were squandered producing cars.
Furthermore, policies designed to promote import substitution often encouraged capital-
intensive production methods, which limited the creation of jobs and hurt export activities. A
country such as Peru could not export automobiles because it could produce them only at a
cost far greater than their price on the world market. Worse still, import substitution policies
encouraged the use of expensive domestic products, such as tractors and fertilizer, instead of
lower-cost imports. These policies taxed the sectors that might have successfully competed in
world markets.
As an alternative to import substitution, some nations have pursued strategies of export
promotion. Export promotion is the policy of encouraging exports. As an industrial market
economy, Japan was a striking example to the developing world of the economic success that
exports can provide. Japan had an average annual per-capita real GDP growth rate of roughly 
6 percent per year from 1960–1990. This achievement was, in part, based on industrial produc-
tion oriented toward foreign consumers.
Several countries in the developing world have attempted to emulate Japan’s success.
Starting around 1970, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, and Taiwan (the “four little dragons”
between the two “big dragons,” China and Japan) began to pursue export promotion of manu-
factured goods. Today their growth rates have surpassed Japan’s. Other nations, including Brazil,
Colombia, and Turkey, have also had some success at pursuing an outward-looking trade policy.
China’s growth has been mostly export-driven as well.
Government support of export promotion has often taken the form of maintaining an
exchange rate favorable enough to permit exports to compete with products manufactured in
developed economies. For example, many people believe China has kept the value of the yuan arti-
ficially low. Because a “cheap” yuan means inexpensive Chinese goods in the United States, sales of
these goods increased dramatically.
A big issue for countries growing or trying to grow by selling exports on world markets is free
trade. African nations in particular have pushed for reductions in tariffs imposed on their 
agricultural goods by Europe and the United States, arguing that these tariffs substantially reduce
Africa’s ability to compete in the world marketplace.
Microfinance
In the mid 1970s, Muhammad Yunus, a young Bangladeshi economist
created the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Yunus, who trained at Vanderbilt University and
was a former professor at Middle Tennessee State University, used this bank as a vehicle to
introduce microfinance to the developing world. In 2006, Yunus received a Nobel Peace 
Prize for his work. Microfinance is the practice of lending very small amounts of money,
with no collateral, and accepting very small savings deposits.2 It is aimed at introducing
entrepreneurs in the poorest parts of the developing world to the capital market. By 2002,
more than 2,500 institutions were making these small loans, serving over 60 million people.
Two-thirds of borrowers were living below the poverty line in their own countries, the poor-
est of the poor.

of Microfinance, (MIT Press, 2005.)

PART VII
The World Economy 
Yunus, while teaching economics in Bangladesh, began lending his own money to poor
households with entrepreneurial ambitions. He found that with even very small amounts of
money, villagers could start simple businesses: bamboo weaving or hair dressing. Traditional
banks found these borrowers unprofitable: The amounts were too small, and it was too expen-
sive to figure out which of the potential borrowers was a good risk. With a borrower having no
collateral, information about his or her character was key but was hard for a big bank to dis-
cover. Local villagers, however, typically knew a great deal about one another’s characters. This
insight formed the basis for Yunus’s microfinance enterprise. Within a village, people who are
interested in borrowing money to start businesses are asked to join lending groups of five peo-
ple. Loans are then made to two of the potential borrowers, later to a second two, and finally to
the last. As long as everyone is repaying their loans, the next group receives theirs. But if the first
borrowers fail to pay, all members of the group are denied subsequent loans. What does this do?
It makes community pressure a substitute for collateral. Moreover, once the peer lending mech-
anism is understood, villagers have incentives to join only with other reliable borrowers. The
mechanism of peer lending is a way to avoid the problems of imperfect information described
in an earlier chapter.
The Grameen model grew rapidly. By 2002, Grameen was lending to two million mem-
bers. Thirty countries and thirty U.S. states have microfinance lending copied from the
Grameen model. Relative to traditional bank loans, microfinance loans are much smaller,
repayment begins very quickly, and the vast majority of the loans are made to women (who, in
many cases, have been underserved by mainstream banks). A growing set of evidence shows
that providing opportunities for poor women has stronger spillovers in terms of improving
the welfare of children than does comparable opportunities for men. While the field of micro-
finance has changed considerably since Yunus’s introduction and some people question how
big a role it will ultimately play in spurring major development and economic growth, it has
changed many people’s views about the possibilities of entrepreneurship for the poor of
the world.
ECONOMICS IN PRACTICE
Cell Phones Increase Profits for Fishermen in India
Kerala is a poor state in a region of India. The fishing industry is a
major part of the local economy, employing more than one mil-
lion people and serving as the main source of protein for the pop-
ulation. Every day fishing boats go out; and when they return, the
captain of the ship needs to decide where to take the fish to sell.
There is much uncertainty in this decision: How much fish will
they catch; what other boats will come to a particular location;
how many buyers will there be at a location? Moreover, fuel costs
are high and timing is difficult, so that once a boat comes ashore,
it does not pay for the fishermen to search for a better market-
place. In a recent study of this area, Robert Jensen1 found on a
Tuesday morning in November 1997, 11 fishermen in Badagara
were dumping their load of fish because they faced no buyers at
the dock. However, unbeknownst to them, 15 kilometers away,
27 buyers were leaving their marketplace empty-handed, with
unsatisfied demand for fish.
Beginning in 1997 and continuing for the next several years,
mobile phone service was introduced to this region of India. By
2001, the majority of the fishing fleet had mobile phones, which
they use to call various vendors ashore to confirm where the buyers
are. What was the result? Once the phones were introduced, waste,
which had averaged 5 to 8 percent of the total catch, was virtually
eliminated. Moreover, just as we would have predicted from the
simple laws of supply and demand, the prices of fish across the var-
ious villages along the fishing market route were closer to each
other than they were before. Jensen found that with less waste fish-
ermen’s profits rose on average by 8 percent, while the average price
of fish fell by 4 percent.
In fact, cell phones are improving the way markets in less
developed countries work by providing price and quantity infor-
mation so that both producers and consumers can make better
economic decisions.

CHAPTER 36
Economic Growth in Developing and Transitional Economies 723
Two Examples of Development: China and India
China and India provide two interesting examples of rapidly developing economies. While low
per-capita incomes still mean that both countries are typically labeled developing as opposed to
developed countries, many expect that to change in the near future. In the 25-year period from
1978 to 2003, China grew, on average, 8 percent per year, a rate faster than any other country in
the world. While India’s surge has been more recent, in the last 5 years, it too has seen annual
growth rates in the 8 to 9 percent range. Many commentators expect India and China to domi-
nate the world economy in the twenty-first century.
How did these two rather different countries engineer their development? Consider
institutions: India is a democratic country, has a history of the rule of law, and has an
English-speaking heritage—all factors typically thought to provide a development advan-
tage. China is still an authoritarian country politically, and property rights are still not well
established—both characteristics that were once thought to hinder growth. Both China and
India have embraced free market economics, with China taking the lead as India has worked
to remove some of its historical regulatory apparatus.
What about social capital? Both India and China remain densely populated. While China
is the most populous country in the world, India, with a smaller land mass, is the world’s
most densely populated country. Nevertheless, as is true in most developing nations, birth
rates in both countries have fallen. Literacy rates and life expectancy in China are quite high,
in part a legacy from an earlier period. India, on the other hand, has a literacy rate that is less
than that of China’s and a lower life expectancy. In terms of human capital, China appears to
have the edge, at least for now.
What about the growth strategies used by the two countries? China has adopted a prag-
matic, gradual approach to development, sharply in contrast to that adopted some years ago
in Poland. China’s approach has been called moshi guohe, or “Crossing the river by feeling for
stepping stones.” In terms of sector, most of China’s growth has been fueled by manufactur-
ing. The focus on manufacturing is one reason that China’s energy consumption and envi-
ronmental issues have increased so rapidly in the last decade. In India, services have led
growth, particularly in the software industry. In sum, it is clear that there is no single recipe
for development.
Development Interventions
To this point we have used the terms growth and development interchangeably, assuming 
that as an economy grows in its level of income, it will develop to provide benefits to most of
its population. Since the 1970s at least, however, economists and policy makers have ques-
tioned the relationship between growth and development. A 1974 World Bank study con-
cluded that “More than a decade of rapid growth in underdeveloped countries has been of
little or no benefit to perhaps a third of their population.” In the last 20 years, development
economists have increasingly turned to much narrower, more microeconomically oriented
programs to see if they can figure out which interventions do help the condition of the bot-
tom of the income distribution in developing countries and how to replicate those successful
programs.
Random and Natural Experiments: Some New Techniques
in Economic Development
Suppose we were trying to decide whether it was worthwhile in terms of student achieve-
ment to hire another teacher to reduce the student-faculty ratio. One traditional way we
might try to answer that question is to find two classrooms with different enrollments in
otherwise similar school systems and look at the educational performance of the students.
We see comparisons of this sort everyday in newspaper discussions of policies, and many

724
PART VII
The World Economy 
research projects take a variant of this approach. But the approach is subject to serious
criticism. It is possible that differences in the two classrooms beyond the enrollment
numbers also matter to performance—differences we have failed to correct in the compar-
isons we make. Crowded classrooms may be in poorer areas (indeed, this may account for
the crowding); they may have less effective teachers; they may lack other resources.
In the social sciences, it is very difficult to ensure that we have comparisons that differ only
in the one element in which we are interested. The fact that our interventions involve people
makes even harder. In the case of the classrooms with small enrollment, it may well be that
the most attentive parents have pushed to have their children in these classrooms, believing
them to be better. Perhaps the best teachers apply to lead these classrooms, and their 
higher quality makes it more likely that they get their first choice of classrooms. If either of
these things happens, the two classrooms will differ in systematic ways that bias the results in
favor of finding better performance in the smaller classrooms. More attentive parents may
provide home support that results in better test outcomes for their children even if
the classrooms are crowded. Better teachers improve performance no matter how crowded
the classrooms are. Problems of this sort, sometimes called selection bias, plague social sci-
ence research.
In recent years, a group of development economists began using a technique borrowed
from the natural sciences, the random experiment, to try to get around the selection
problem in evaluating interventions. Instead of looking at results from classrooms that have
made different choices about class size or textbooks, for example, the experimenters
randomly assign otherwise identical-looking classes to follow an intervention or not.
Students and teachers are not allowed to shift around. By comparing the outcomes of large
numbers of randomly selected subjects with control groups, social scientists hope to identify
effects of interventions in much the same way natural scientists evaluate the efficacy of vari-
ous drugs.
The leading development group engaged in random experiments in the education and
health areas is the Poverty Research Lab at MIT, run by Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee. By
working with a range of NGOs and government agencies in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, these
economists have looked at a wide range of possible investments to help improve outcomes for the
poorest of the poor.
Of course, not all policies can be evaluated this way. Experimenters do not always 
have the luxury of random assignment. An alternative technique is to rely on what have been
called natural experiments to mimic the controlled experiment. Suppose I am interested in
the effect of an increase in wealth on the likelihood that a poor family will enroll its
daughters in school. Comparing school behavior of rich and poor families is obviously
problematic because they are likely to differ in too many ways to control adequately. Nor 
does it seem feasible to substantially increase the wealth of a large number of randomly
selected parents. But in an agrarian community we may observe random, annual weather
occurrences that naturally lead to occasional years of plenty, and by observing behavior in
those years versus other years, we may learn a good deal. The weather in this case has created
a natural experiment.
Empirical development economics thus has added experimental methods to its tool kit
as a way to answer some of the very difficult and important questions about what does and
does not work to improve the lot of the poor in developing nations. We turn now to look at
some of the recent work in the fields of education and health, focusing on this experimental
work, to provide some sense of the exciting work going on in this field.
Education Ideas
As we suggested earlier, human capital is an important ingredient in the economic growth of
a nation. As economies grow, returns to education also typically grow. As we move from
traditional agrarian economies to more diversified and complex economies, the advantages
to an individual from education rises. So if we want a nation’s poor to benefit from growth,

CHAPTER 36
Economic Growth in Developing and Transitional Economies 725
improving their educational outcomes is key. This leads us to one of the central preoccupations
of development economists in the last decade or so: Of the many investments one 
could make in education, which have the highest payoffs? Is it better to invest in more books 
or more teachers? How much does the quality of teachers matter? Are investments most
important in the first years of education or later? In a world with limited resources in which
educational outcomes are very important, getting the right answers to these questions 
is vital.
For most middle-class American students, it may come as a surprise that in the developing
world, teacher absenteeism is a serious problem. A recent study led by researchers from the
World Bank found, for example, that on an average day, 27 percent of Ugandan and 
25 percent of Indian teachers are not at work. Across six poor countries, teacher absences aver-
aged 19 percent. The Poverty Research Lab has conducted a number of experiments in a 
range of developing countries to see how one might reduce these absences. The most successful
intervention was introduced in Rajasthan, India, by an NGO called Seva Mandir. Each day when
he or she arrived, the teachers in half of Seva Mandir’s 160-single teacher schools were asked to
have their picture taken with the children. Cameras were date-stamped. This evidence of atten-
dance fed into the compensation of the teacher. Teacher absentee rates were cut in half relative
to the seemingly identical classrooms in which no cameras were introduced.
Student absenteeism is also a problem throughout the developing world, reducing
educational outcomes even when schools are well staffed with qualified teachers. Several
countries, including Mexico, have introduced cash payments to parents for sending their
children to school regularly. Since the Mexican government introduced these payments over
time, in ways not likely to be related to educational outcomes, researchers could compare stu-
dent absenteeism across seemingly identical areas with and without the cash incentives as a
form of natural experiment. There is some evidence that cash payments do increase school
attendance. Natural experiments have also been used to look at the effect of industrialization
that improves educational returns as a way to induce better school attendance; the results have
been positive.
Work using experiments, both natural and random, is still at an early stage in development
economics. While many reform ideas have proven helpful in improving educational outcomes
in different developing countries, it has proven hard up to now to find simple answers that
work across the globe. Nevertheless, these new techniques appear to offer considerable promise
as a way of tackling issues of improving education for the poor of the developing world.
Health Improvements
Poor health is a second major contributor to individual poverty. In the developing world, esti-
mates are that one-quarter of the population is infected with intestinal worms that sap the
energy of children and adults alike. Malaria remains a major challenge in Africa, as does
HIV/AIDS.
In the case of many interventions to improve health, human behavior plays an important
role, and here is where development economics has focused. For many diseases, we 
have workable vaccines. But we need to figure out how to encourage people to walk to health
clinics or schools to get those vaccines. We want to know if charging for a vaccine will substan-
tially reduce uptake. For many waterborne diseases, treatment of
drinking water 
with bleach is effective, but the taste is bad and bleach is not free. How do we induce usage?
Treated bed nets can reduce malaria, but only if they are properly used. In each of these cases,
there are benefits to the individual from seeking treatment or preventive care, but also costs. In
the last several years, a number of development economists have explored the way in which
individuals in developing economies have responded to policies that try to change these costs
and benefits.
Intestinal worms, quite common in areas of Africa with inadequate sanitation, are treatable
with periodic drugs at a relatively low cost. Michael Kremer and Ted Miguel, working with 
the World Bank, used random experiments in Kenya to examine the effect of health education

726
PART VII
The World Economy 
and user fees on families’ take-up of treatment of their children. Kremer and Miguel found a
number of interesting results, results very much in keeping with economic principles. First, a pro-
gram of charging user fees—even relatively low ones—dramatically reduced treatment rates. The
World Bank’s attempts to make programs more financially self-sustaining, if used in this area, were
likely to have large, averse public health effects. Elasticities were well above one. Kremer and
Miguel also found that as the proportion of vaccinated people in a village grew, and thus the risk of
contagion fell, fewer people wanted treatment, indicating some sensitivity to costs and benefit cal-
culations by the villagers. Disappointingly, health education did not seem to make much difference.
As with the area of education, much remains for development economists to understand
in the area of health and human behavior. Development economics continues to be one of the
most exciting areas in economics.
Population Issues
The populations of the developing nations are estimated to be growing at about 1.7 percent
per year. If the Third World’s population growth remained at this level, within 41 years its
population would double from its 1990 level of 4.1 billion to over 8 billion by the year 2031.
For poor nations, rapid population growth can strain infrastructure and may impede devel-
opment. For this reason, population control has at times been part of the development strat-
egy of a number of nations.
Figure 36.1 provides the long historical record of population growth in the world. More
than 200 years ago, the Reverend Thomas Malthus, England’s first professor of political
economy, expressed his fears about this record of population growth. Malthus believed that
populations inexorably grew geometrically at a constant growth rate, while the diminishing
productivity of land caused food supplies to grow more slowly. Looking at the two phenom-
ena together led Malthus to predict the increasing impoverishment of the world’s people
unless population could be slowed.
Malthus’s fears for Europe and America proved unfounded. Technological changes revo-
lutionized agriculture so that food supplies grew despite the scarcity of land. At the same

 FIGURE 36.1 The Growth of World Population, Projected to A.D. 2020
For thousands of years, population grew slowly. From A.D. 1 until the mid 1600s, population grew at
about .04 percent per year. Since the Industrial Revolution, population growth has occurred at an
unprecedented rate.

time, population growth fell dramatically in Europe and America. Nor did Malthus 
fully see the causal connection between technical change, economic growth, and population.
As early as the mid 1960s, economist T. W. Schultz argued that technical progress increased
the returns to education by making it harder for children to simply move into the 
jobs of their parents. Faced with this recognition, more parents in the developing world
reduced their family sizes to better consolidate resources for education. Economists have
referred to this reduction in family size and increase in child education levels as trading
quantity of children for quality. In some countries, market forces pushing populations
toward reduced family size have been helped along by government policies aimed at reduc-
ing populations.
Of course, there are parts of the developing world in which population growth contin-
ues at high levels. Uganda, with a GDP of $300 per capita, had a population growth rate in
2008 of 3.6 percent, one of the highest in the world. As an agrarian economy with high infant
mortality rates, Uganda, as well as a number of other countries, still values large families. In
agrarian societies, children are sources of farm labor and they may make significant contri-
butions to household income. In societies without public old-age-support or social security
programs, children may also provide a source of income for parents who are too old to sup-
port themselves. With the high value of children enhanced by high rates of infant mortality,
it is no wonder that families try to have many children to ensure that a sufficient number will
survive into adulthood.
Economic theories of population growth suggest that fertility decisions made by poor
families should not be viewed as uninformed and uncontrolled. An individual family may
find that having many children is a rational strategy for economic survival given the condi-
tions in which it finds itself. Only when the relationship between the costs and benefits of
having children changes, in places like Uganda, will fertility rates decline. This does not mean,
however, that having many children is a net benefit to society as a whole.When a family
decides to have a large number of children, it imposes costs on the rest of society; the children
must be educated, their health provided for, and so on. In other words, what makes sense for
an individual household may create negative effects for the nation as a whole.
The Transition to a Market Economy
In the last several decades, a number of countries have made the transition from a planned
economy to a market economy. Russia and the formerly Communist countries of Eastern
Europe led the way in this transition beginning in the late-1980s. For a number of these coun-
tries, the early transition period was difficult, and there has been considerable debate about the
optimal speed of transitions and ways to manage the social upheaval that often comes with
economic reform.
For example, between 1992 and 2002, while per-capita income grew by 51 percent in Poland,
it shrank by 63 percent in the Ukraine. Countries of the former USSR seem to have had a partic-
ularly difficult transition to market economies. Economists have attributed differences in ease of
transition to reform strategies (slow versus fast), resource endowments of the country, and differ-
ences in institutions.
In more recent years, China and Vietnam have joined the collection of transition
economies, coming to rely less on central planning for economic decisions and more on the
market. India too is sometimes thought to be a transition economy, as it has in the last
decade dismantled much of its government ownership and elaborate rules governing 
market transactions.
Six Basic Requirements for Successful Transition
Economists generally agree on six basic requirements for a successful transition to a market-
based system: (1) macroeconomic stabilization, (2) deregulation of prices and liberalization of
trade, (3) privatization of state-owned enterprises and development of new private industry,
CHAPTER 36
Economic Growth in Developing and Transitional Economies 727

728
PART VII
The World Economy 
(4) establishment of market-supporting institutions such as property and contract laws and
accounting systems, (5) a social safety net to deal with unemployment and poverty, and (6) exter-
nal assistance. We now discuss each component.
Macroeconomic Stabilization
Many countries in transition have had a problem with
inflation, but nowhere has it been worse than in Russia. As economic conditions worsened, the
government found itself with serious budget problems. As revenue flows slowed and expenditure
commitments increased, large budget deficits resulted. At the same time, each of the new
republics established its own central bank. Each central bank began issuing “ruble credits”to keep
important enterprises afloat and to pay the government’s bills. The issuance of these credits,
which were generally accepted as a means of payment throughout the country, led to a dramatic
expansion of the money supply.
Almost from the beginning, the expanded money supply meant too much money was
chasing too few goods. This was made worse by government-controlled prices set substan-
tially below market-clearing levels. The combination of monetary expansion and price con-
trol was deadly. Government-run shops that sold goods at controlled prices were empty.
People waited in line for days and often became violent when their efforts to buy goods at
low official prices were thwarted. At the same time, suppliers found that they could charge
much higher prices for their products on the black market—which grew bigger by the day,
further exacerbating the shortage of goods at government shops. Over time, the ruble
became worth less and less as black market prices continued to rise more rapidly. Russia
found itself with near hyperinflation in 1992. To achieve a properly functioning market sys-
tem, prices must be stabilized. To do so, the government must find a way to move toward a
balanced budget and to bring the supply of money under control. China and India, in
contrast to Russia and Eastern European states, initially suffered only modest inflation 
as they decontrolled their prices, though more recently inflation appears to be increasing 
in China.
Deregulation of Prices and Liberalization of Trade
To move successfully
from central planning to a market system, individual prices must be deregulated. A system of
freely moving prices forms the backbone of a market system. When people want more of a
good than is currently being produced, its price will rise. This higher price increases produc-
ers’ profits and provides an incentive for existing firms to expand production and for new
firms to enter the industry. Conversely, if an industry is producing a good for which there 
is no market or a good that people no longer want in the same quantity, the result will be
excess supply and the price of that good will fall. This outcome reduces profits or creates
losses, providing an incentive for some existing firms to cut back on production and 
for others to go out of business. In short, an unregulated price mechanism ensures an
efficient allocation of resources across industries. Until prices are deregulated, this mecha-
nism cannot function. In practice, transition economies have moved at varying speeds in
decontrolling prices. Vietnam, for example, decontrolled prices very quickly in moving to a
market economy, as did Poland. China, on the other hand, took a slower path in freeing
prices from state control.
Trade barriers must also be removed. Reform-minded countries must be able to import
capital, technology, and ideas. In addition, it makes no sense to continue to subsidize indus-
tries that cannot be competitive on world markets. If it is cheaper to buy steel from an effi-
cient West German steel mill than to produce it in a subsidized antiquated Russian mill, the
Russian mill should be modernized or shut down. Ultimately, as the theory of comparative
advantage suggests, liberalized trade will push each country to produce the products it pro-
duces best.

CHAPTER 36
Economic Growth in Developing and Transitional Economies 729
Deregulating prices and eliminating subsidies can bring serious political problems.
Many products in Russia and the rest of the socialist world were priced below market-
clearing levels for equity reasons. Housing, food, and clothing were considered by many to
be entitlements. Making them more expensive, at least relative to their prices in previous
times, is not likely to be popular. In 2008, rising rice prices in Southeast Asia caused con-
siderable unrest in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia. In addition, forcing inefficient 
firms to operate without subsidies will lead many of them to go out of business, and jobs will
be lost. So while price deregulation and trade liberalization are necessary, they are very diffi-
cult politically.
Privatization
One problem with a system of central ownership is a lack of accountability.
Under a system of private ownership, owners reap the rewards of their successes and suffer the
consequences of their failures. Private ownership provides a strong incentive for efficient oper-
ation, innovation, and hard work that is lacking when ownership is centralized and profits are
distributed to the people.
The classic story to illustrate this point is called the tragedy of commons, which is the
idea that collective ownership may not provide the proper private incentives for efficiency
because individuals do not bear the full costs of their own decisions but do enjoy the full ben-
efits. Suppose an agricultural community has 10,000 acres of grazing land. If the land was
held in common so that all farmers had unlimited rights to graze their animals, each farmer
would have an incentive to overgraze. He or she would reap the full benefits from grazing
additional calves while the costs of grazing the calves would be borne collectively. The system
provides no incentive to manage the land efficiently. Similarly, if the efficiency and benefits of
your hard work and managerial skills accrue to others or to the state, what incentive do you
have to work hard or to be efficient?
One solution to the tragedy of commons attempted in eighteenth-century Britain was to
divide up the land into private holdings. Today, many economists argue, the solution to the
incentive problem encountered in state-owned enterprises is to privatize them and let the
owners compete.
In addition to increasing accountability, privatization means creating a climate in which new
enterprises can flourish. If there is market demand for a product not currently being produced,
individual entrepreneurs should be free to set up a business and make a profit. During the last
months of the Soviet Union’s existence, private enterprises such as taxi services, car repair ser-
vices, restaurants, and even hotels began to spring up all over the country.
Like deregulation of prices, privatization is difficult politically. Privatization means that
many protected enterprises will go out of business because they cannot compete at world prices,
resulting in a loss of jobs, at least temporarily.
Market-Supporting Institutions
Between 1991 and 1997, U.S. firms raced to Eastern
Europe in search of markets and investment opportunities and immediately became aware of a
major obstacle. The institutions that make the market function relatively smoothly in the United
States did not exist in Eastern Europe. For example, the capital market, which channels private
saving into productive capital investment in developed capitalist economies, is made up of hun-
dreds of different institutions. The banking system, venture capital funds, the stock market, the
bond market, commodity exchanges, brokerage houses, investment banks, and so on, have devel-
oped in the United States over hundreds of years, and they could not be replicated overnight in
the formerly Communist world.
Similar problems exist in the Chinese economy. While the Chinese equity market has grown
rapidly in the last decade, that growth has been accompanied by problems with weak governance
and lack of transparency. These issues discourage investments by western firms.
tragedy of commons
The idea that collective
ownership may not provide the
proper private incentives for
efficiency because individuals
do not bear the full costs of
their own decisions but do
enjoy the full benefits.

Many market-supporting institutions are so basic that Americans take them for granted.
The institution of private property, for example, is a set of rights that must be protected by laws
that the government must be willing to enforce. Suppose the French hotel chain Novotel decides
to build a new hotel in Moscow or Beijing. Novotel must first acquire land. Then it will con-
struct a building based on the expectation of renting rooms to customers. These investments are
made with the expectation that the owner has a right to use them and a right to the profits that
they produce. For such investments to be undertaken, these rights must be guaranteed by a set
of property laws. This is equally true for large business firms and for local entrepreneurs who
want to start their own enterprises. China’s ambiguous property rights laws may also be prob-
lematic. While farmers can own their own homes, for example, all rural land is collectively
owned by villages. Farmers have the right to manage farmland, but not own it. As a result, trans-
fer of land is difficult.
Similarly, the law must provide for the enforcement of contracts. In the United States, a huge
body of law determines what happens if you break a formal promise made in good faith.
Businesses exist on promises to produce and promises to pay. Without recourse to the law when a
contract is breached, contracts will not be entered into, goods will not be manufactured, and ser-
vices will not be provided.
Protection of intellectual property rights is also an important feature of developed market
economies. When an artist puts out a record, the artist and his or her studio are entitled to reap
revenues from it.When Apple developed the iPod, it too earned the right to collect revenue for its
patent ownership. Many less developed countries lack laws and enforcement mechanisms to
protect intellectual property of foreign investments and their own current and future investors.
The lack of protection discourages trade and home-grown invention. For example, in late 2007,
China, in recognition of some of these issues, began drafting a new set of laws for intellectual
property protection.
Another seemingly simple matter that turns out to be quite complex is the establishment
of a set of accounting principles. In the United States, the rules of the accounting game are
embodied in a set of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that carry the force of
law. Companies are required to keep track of their receipts, expenditures, and liabilities so
that their performance can be observed and evaluated by shareholders, taxing authorities,
and others who have an interest in the company. If you have taken a course in accounting,
you know how detailed these rules have become. Imagine trying to do business in a country
operating under hundreds of different sets of rules. That is what happened in Russia during
its transition.
Another institution is insurance. Whenever a venture undertakes a high-risk activity, it buys
insurance to protect itself. Several years ago Amnesty International (a nonprofit organization that
works to protect civil liberties around the world) sponsored a worldwide concert tour with a
number of well-known rock bands and performers. The most difficult part of organizing the tour
was obtaining insurance for the artists and their equipment when they played in the then-
Communist countries of Eastern Europe.
Social Safety Net
In a centrally planned socialist economy, the labor market does not func-
tion freely. Everyone who wants a job is guaranteed one somewhere. The number of jobs is deter-
mined by a central plan to match the number of workers. There is essentially no unemployment.
This, it has been argued, is one of the great advantages of a planned system. In addition, a central
planning system provides basic housing, food, and clothing at very affordable levels for all. With
no unemployment and necessities available at very low prices, there is no need for unemploy-
ment insurance, welfare, or other social programs.
Transition to a free labor market and liberalization of prices means that some workers
will end up unemployed and that everyone will pay higher prices for necessities. Indeed,
during the early phases of the transition process, unemployment will be high. Inefficient
state-owned enterprises will go out of business; some sectors will contract while others
expand. As more and more people experience unemployment, popular support for reform is
likely to drop unless some sort of social safety net is erected to ease the transition. This social
730
PART VII
The World Economy 

safety net might include unemployment insurance, aid for the poor, and food and housing
assistance. The experiences of the developed world have shown that such programs 
are expensive.
External Assistance
Very few believe that the transition to a market system can be achieved
without outside support and some outside financing. Knowledge of and experience with capitalist
institutions that exist in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan are of vital interest to the
Eastern European nations. The basic skills of accounting, management, and enterprise develop-
ment can be taught to developing nations; many say it is in everyone’s best interest to do so.
There is little agreement about the extent of financial support that should be given, how-
ever. In the case of Russia, the United States pushed for a worldwide effort to provide billions
of dollars in aid, to stabilize its macroeconomy, and to buy desperately needed goods from
abroad. For China, no such aid was thought to be necessary.
Shock Therapy or Gradualism?
Although economists generally agreed on what
the former socialist economies needed to do, they debated the sequence and timing of spe-
cific reforms.
The popular press described the debate as one between those who believe in “shock therapy”
(sometimes called the Big Bang approach) and those who prefer a more gradual approach.Advocates
of shock therapy believe that the economies in transition should proceed immediately on all fronts.
They should stop printing money, deregulate prices and liberalize trade, privatize, develop market
institutions, build a social safety net, and acquire external aid—all as quickly as possible. The pain will
be severe,the argument goes,but in the end,it will be forgotten as the transition raises living standards.
Advocates of a gradualist approach believe the best course is to build up market institutions first,grad-
ually decontrol prices, and privatize only the most efficient government enterprises first.
Those who favor moving quickly point to the apparent success of Poland, which moved
rapidly through the first phases of reform. Russia’s experience during the first years of its
transition demonstrated that, at least in that country, change must, to some extent, be grad-
ual. In theory, stabilization and price liberalization can be achieved instantaneously. To enjoy
the benefits of liberalization, a good deal of privatization must have taken place—and that
takes time. One analyst has said that privatization means “selling assets with no value to peo-
ple with no money.” Some estimates suggest that half of Russian state-owned enterprises
were incapable of making a profit at world prices. Simply cutting them loose would create
chaos. In a sense, Russia had no choice but to move slowly.
CHAPTER 36
Economic Growth in Developing and Transitional Economies 731
1. The economic problems facing the developing countries
are often quite different from those confronting industri-
alized nations. The policy options available to govern-
ments may also differ. Nonetheless, the tools of economic
analysis are as useful in understanding the economies of
less developed countries as in understanding the 
U.S. economy.
LIFE IN THE DEVELOPING NATIONS: POPULATION
AND POVERTY p. 714
2. The central reality of life in the developing countries 
is poverty. Although there is considerable diversity 
across the developing nations, most of the people in 
most developing countries are extremely poor by 
U.S. standards.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: SOURCES AND
STRATEGIES p. 715
3. Almost all developing nations have a scarcity of physical
capital relative to other resources, especially labor. The
vicious-circle-of-poverty hypothesis says that poor coun-
tries cannot escape from poverty because they cannot
afford to postpone consumption—that is, to save—to
make investments. In its crude form, the hypothesis is
wrong inasmuch as some prosperous countries were at
one time poorer than many developing countries are
today. However, it is often difficult to mobilize saving effi-
ciently in many developing nations.
4. Human capital—the stock of education and skills
embodied in the workforce—plays a vital role in
economic development.

5. Developing countries are often burdened by inadequate social
overhead capital, ranging from poor public health and sanita-
tion facilities to inadequate roads, telephones, and court sys-
tems. Such social overhead capital is often expensive to provide,
and many governments are not in a position to undertake many
useful projects because they are too costly.
6. Inefficient and corrupt bureaucracies also play a role in
retarding economic development in places.
7. Among the many questions governments in developing
nations must answer as they seek a road to growth and devel-
opment is how much to rely on free working markets versus
central planning. In recent decades, the pendulum has shifted
toward market based strategies, with governments playing
more of a role in creating institutions supportive of markets.
8. Because developed economies are characterized by a large
share of output and employment in the industrial sector, many
developing countries seem to believe that development and
industrialization are synonymous. In many cases, developing
countries have pursued industry at the expense of agriculture,
with mixed results. Recent evidence suggests that some balance
between industry and agriculture leads to the best outcome.
9. Import-substitution policies, a trade strategy that favors
developing local industries that can manufacture goods to
replace imports, were once very common in developing
nations. In general, such policies have not succeeded as well
as those promoting open, export-oriented economies.
10. The failure of many central planning efforts has brought
increasing calls for less government intervention and more
market orientation in developing economies.
11. Microfinance—lending small amounts to poor borrowers
using peer lending groups—has become an important
new tool in encouraging entrepreneurship in develop-
ing countries.
12. China and India have followed quite different paths in recent
development.
DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS p. 723 
13. Development economists have begun to use randomized exper-
iments as a way to test the usefulness of various interventions.
In these experiments, modeled after the natural sciences,
individuals or even villages are randomly assigned to
receive various interventions and the outcomes they expe-
rience are compared with those of control groups. In the
areas of education and health, random experiments have
been most prevalent.
14. Development economists also rely on natural experiments
to learn about the efficacy of various interventions. In a
natural experiment, we compare areas with differing con-
ditions that emerge as a consequence of an unrelated out-
side force.
15. Many of the newer economic studies focus on understand-
ing how to motivate individuals to take actions that sup-
port policy interventions: to use health equipment
properly, to attend schools, to receive vaccinations.
16. Rapid population growth is characteristic of many devel-
oping countries. Large families can be economically ratio-
nal because parents need support in their old age or
because children offer an important source of labor.
However, having many children does not mean a net bene-
fit to society as a whole. Rapid population growth can put a
strain on already overburdened public services such as edu-
cation and health.
THE TRANSITION TO A MARKET ECONOMY p. 727 
17. Economists generally agree on six requirements for a suc-
cessful transition from socialism to a market-based system:
(1) macroeconomic stabilization, (2) deregulation of prices
and liberalization of trade, (3) privatization, (4) establish-
ment of market-supporting institutions, (5) a social safety
net, and (6) external assistance.
18. Much debate exists about the sequence and timing of spe-
cific reforms. The idea of shock therapy is to proceed
immediately on all six fronts, including rapid deregulation
of prices and privatization. The gradualist approach is to
build up market institutions first, gradually decontrol
prices, and privatize only the most efficient government
enterprises first.

P R O B L E M S
All problems are available on www.myeconlab.com
1. One of the biggest problem facing developing countries across
the globe in 2009 was disease. More than 1 million people died
of malaria and over 2 million deaths were due to HIV/AIDS,
with most of these deaths occurring in Africa. Describe the
effects of these diseases on the economies of these countries.
Make sure you discuss the sources of economic growth and the
use of scarce resources.
2. For a developing country to grow, it needs capital. The major
source of capital in most countries is domestic saving, but the
goal of stimulating domestic saving usually is in conflict with
government policies aimed at reducing inequality in the dis-
tribution of income. Comment on this trade-off between
equity and growth. How would you go about resolving the
issue if you were the president of a small, poor country?
3. The GDP of any country can be divided into two kinds of
goods: capital goods and consumption goods. The proportion
of national output devoted to capital goods determines, to some
extent, the nation’s growth rate.
a. Explain how capital accumulation leads to economic growth.
b. Briefly describe how a market economy determines how
much investment will be undertaken each period.
c. Consumption versus investment is a more painful conflict to
resolve for developing countries. Comment on that statement.
d. If you were the benevolent dictator of a developing country,
what plans would you implement to increase per capita GDP?
4. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were
scheduled to formally cancel the debts of 18 very poor coun-
tries in 2006, and the African Development Bank was com-
mitted to taking the same action during its 2006 annual
meeting. Go online and find out whether these debts were
indeed canceled. How much debt was forgiven during that
year in each of the countries involved? What are the expected
benefits to those countries?
5. Poor countries are trapped in a vicious circle of poverty. For
output to grow, they must accumulate capital. To accumulate
capital, they must save (consume less than they produce).
Because they are poor, they have little or no extra output avail-
able for savings—it must all go to feed and clothe the present
generation. Thus they are doomed to stay poor forever.
Comment on each step in that argument.
6. Famines are acts of God resulting from bad weather or other
natural disasters. There is nothing we can do about them except
to send food relief after they occur. Explain why that position is
inaccurate. Concentrate on agricultural pricing policies and dis-
tributional issues.
7. In China, rural property is owned collectively by the village
while being managed under long-term contracts by individual
farmers. Why might this be a problem in terms of optimal land
managment, use, and allocation?
8. How does peer lending used in microfinance help to solve the
problem of adverse selection?
9. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 722] Find another
example of the use of cell phones as a way to improve market
functioning in a developing economy.
10. [Related to the Economics in Practice on p. 718] Corruption
in a government is often accompanied by inefficiency in the
economy. Why should this be true?
11. The distribution of income in a capitalist economy is likely to be
more unequal than it is in a socialist economy. Why is this so? Is
there a tension between the goal of limiting inequality and the
goal of motivating risk taking and hard work? Explain your
answer in detail.
12. The following quote is from the Encyclopedia of the Developing
World: “[Some scholars] suggest that poor people are not poor
because they have large families, but rather they have large fami-
lies because they are poor.” Explain the logic behind this quote.
Source: Thomas M. Leonard, editor, Encyclopedia of the
Developing World, Vol. 3, p. 1297, 2006.
13. Explain how each of the following can limit the economic
growth of developing nations.
a. Insufficient capital formation
b. A shortage of human resources
c. A lack of social overhead capital
14. Of the roughly 7 billion people in the world, more than 75 per-
cent live in developing countries, and one issue of economic
concern in many of these countries is that of population
growth. In the summary report of the Population Reference
Bureau’s 2008 World Population Data Sheet, PRB president Bill
Butz made the following comment: “Nearly all of world popula-
tion growth is now concentrated in the world’s poorer coun-
tries. Even the small amount of overall growth in the wealthier
nations will largely result from immigration.” Explain how rapid
population growth can limit a nation’s productivity. Are there
any ways in which population growth can have a positive eco-
nomic effect? Explain.

Reference Bureau, August 19, 2008.
15. You have been hired as an economic consultant for the nation
of Ishtar. Ishtar is a developing nation that has recently

MICROECONOMIC STRUCTURE
The organization of the microeconomics chapters continues to reflect the authors’ belief that the best way to
understand how market economies operate—and the best way to understand basic economic theory—is to
work through a simple model of a perfectly competitive market system first, including discussions of output
markets (goods and services) and input markets (land, labor, and capital), and the connections between
them. Only then do the authors turn to noncompetitive market structures such as monopoly and oligopoly.
When students have worked through a simple model of a perfectly competitive market system, they begin to 
understand how the pieces of the economy “fit together.” Learning perfect competition first also enables 
students to see the power of the market system. It is impossible to discuss the efficiency of markets as well as
the problems that arise from markets until students have seen how a simple perfectly competitive market 
produces and distributes goods and services. The accompanying visual gives you an overview of the structure.
CHAPTERS 6–8 provide an overview of firm and household decision making in simple perfectly 
competitive markets.
CHAPTERS 9–11 show how firms and households interact in output markets (goods and services) and 
input markets (labor, land, and capital) to determine prices, wages, and profits.
CHAPTER 12 is a pivotal chapter that links simple perfectly competitive markets with a discussion of
market imperfections and the role of government.
CHAPTERS 13–19 cover the three noncompetitive market structures (monopoly, oligopoly, and 
monopolistic competition), externalities, public goods, uncertainty and asymmetric information, and 
income distribution as well as taxation and government finance.

MACROECONOMIC STRUCTURE
The organization of the macroeconomics chapters continues to reflect the authors’ view that in order for 
students to understand aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves, they must first understand how the
goods market and the money market function. The logic behind the simple demand curve is wrong when
applied to the relationship between aggregate demand and the price level. Similarly, the logic behind the 
simple supply curve is wrong when applied to the relationship between aggregate supply and the price level.
The authors believe the best way to teach the reasoning embodied in the aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply curves without creating serious confusion is to build up to them carefully. The accompanying
visual gives you an overview of the macroeconomic structure.
CHAPTERS 23–24 examine the market for goods and services.
CHAPTERS 25–26 examine the money market.
CHAPTER 27 brings the two markets together, explaining the links between aggregate output (Y) and the
interest rate (r), and how to derive the aggregate demand curve.
CHAPTER 28 introduces the aggregate supply curve and how to determine the price level (P).
CHAPTER 29 shows how the labor market fits into this macroeconomic picture.

MyEconLab Picks Up Where Lectures and Office Hours Leave Off
Instructors choose MyEconLab:
“MyEconLab offers them a way to practice every week. They receive immediate feedback and a 
feeling of personal attention. As a result, my teaching has become more targeted and efficient.”
—Kelly Blanchard, Purdue University
“Students tell me that offering them MyEconLab is almost like offering them individual tutors.”
—Jefferson Edwards, Cypress Fairbanks College
“Chapter quizzes offset student procrastination by ensuring they keep on task. If a student is having
a problem, MyEconLab indicates exactly what they need to study.”
—Diana Fortier, Waubonsee Community College
Students choose MyEconLab:
In a recent study, 87 percent of students who used MyEconLab regularly felt it improved their grade.
“It was very useful because it had EVERYTHING, from practice exams to exercises to reading.
Very helpful.”
—student, Northern Illinois University
“It was very helpful to get instant feedback. Sometimes I would get lost reading the book, and these
individual problems would help me focus and see if I understood the concepts.”
—student, Temple University
“I would recommend taking the quizzes on MyEconLab because they give you a true account of
whether or not you understand the material.”
—student, Montana Tech
Students learn best when they attend lectures and
keep up with their reading and assignments…
but learning shouldn’t end when class is over.
