Scope for Scenario

Identifying the Assets
Decide upon level of detail
Make list of all assets
Document in scope and out of scope items

Drawing Data Flow Diagrams

Data Flow Diagrams
Communicate how system works
Problems follow data
Relatively simple
Can be reused for other purposes
Used with most threat modeling 
methodologies

Scenario Data Flow Diagram

Creating Architecture Overview
Diagram level should match items in scope
It should be a proper representation
Identify what application does
Identify the technology
Diagram is first output

Analyzing the Target

Scenario

Decompose the Application
 Input validation
Session management
 Authentication
Cryptography
 Authorization
Parameter manipulation
 Configuration management Exception management
 Sensitive Data                       Auditing and logging
 Personal Data / PII

Identifying and Documenting Threats

STRIDE
 Spoofing
 Tampering
 Repudiation
 Information disclosure
 Denial of service
 Elevation of privilege

Spoofing
 Pretending to be someone else
 COOKIE: administrator=yes
 Authentication cookie can be spoofed

Tampering
 Modifying something
 Traffic lacks integrity checks

Repudiation
 Claiming that you weren’t responsibe
 Database lacks audit trails

Information Disclosure
 Providing information to someone not 
authorized
 Unauthorized access to email database

Denial of Service
 Not allowing others to use resources
 Application lacks throttling

Elevation of Privilege
 Performing actions they shouldn’t be 
allowed to
 Missing authorization checks

Scenario Data Flow Diagram

Techniques to Find Threats
 STRIDE
 Attack libraries
 Attack trees
 DESIST

DESIST
 Dispute
 Elevation of privilege
 Spoofing
 Information disclosure
 Service denial
 Tampering

Document Threats
 Target                    Web application process
 Attack technique  Forging a cookie
 Countermeasure   Use strong value

Rating Threats

Rating Threats
 Be open about classification system
 Use a repeatable classification system
- DREAD
- OWASP risk rating methodology
- CVSS

DREAD
 Damage potential
 Reproducibility
 Exploitability
 Affected users
 Discoverability

Forging a Cookie
 Damage potential      High (3)
 Reproducibility
