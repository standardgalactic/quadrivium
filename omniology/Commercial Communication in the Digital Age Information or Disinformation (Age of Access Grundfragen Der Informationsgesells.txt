Editor’s Preface
Whenever we talk about information, access is one of the terms most frequently
used. The concept has many facets and suﬀers from a lack of deﬁnition. Its many
dimensions are being analysed in diﬀerent disciplines, from diﬀerent viewpoints
and in diﬀerent traditions of research; yet they are rarely perceived as parts of a
whole, as relevant aspects of one phenomenon. The book series Age of Access?
Fundamental Questions of the Information Society takes up the challenge and
attempts to bring the relevant discourses, scholarly as well as practical, together
in order to come to a more precise idea of the central role that the accessibility
of information plays for human societies.
The ubiquitous talk of the “information society” and the “age of access”
hints at this central role, but tends to implicitly suggest either that information
is accessible everywhere and for everyone, or that it should be. Both suggestions
need to be more closely analysed. The ﬁrst volume of the series adresses the
topic of information justice and thus the question of whether information should
be accessible everywhere and for everyone. Further volumes analyse in detail
the physical, economic, intellectual, linguistic, psychological, political, demo-
graphic and technical dimensions of the accessibility and inaccessibility of
information – enabling readers to test the hypothesis that information is acces-
sible everywhere and for everyone.
The series places special emphasis on the fact that access to information has
a diachronic as well as a synchronic dimension – and that thus cultural heritage
research and practices are highly relevant to the question of access to informa-
tion. Its volumes analyse the potential and the consequences of new access
technologies and practices, and investigate areas in which accessibility is merely
simulated or where the inaccessibility of information has gone unnoticed. The
series also tries to identify the limits of the quest for access. The resulting variety
of topics and discourses is united in one common proposition: It is only when
all dimensions of the accessibility of information have been analysed that we
can rightfully speak of an information society.

Introduction: Commercial Communication in
the Digital Age – Disinforming Informed Users?
The lines between diﬀerent advertising formats and other forms of corporate
communication are blurring. Thus, this book is not primarily about advertising
or online word of mouth, it is not primarily about PR or native advertising
and it is not primarily about e-commerce and viral marketing. Rather, the title
and the book as a whole summarize the broad range of formats and types that
can be subsumed under the heading “commercial communication”. All these
formats and types of commercial communication face the same challenges in
the digital age and are mainly induced by technological innovation. This rapid
technological evolution includes changes in the media usage and the business
and revenue models of the communication industry, with the eﬀect of changing
the threats to the individual user.
In this book, we proceed from two observations: Firstly, the amount of
information available has risen – providing the context in which commercial
communication takes place. Secondly, the vehicles and means of commercial
communication in general have changed. However, we question whether the
amount of information concerning commercial communication has risen corre-
spondingly and whether this information is even readily accessible to consumers.
Are digital consumers informed consumers? Does commercial communication in
the digital age provide information or disinformation? And what does the answer
mean for its eﬀectiveness? The various contributions to this volume consider the
question of whether commercial communication in the digital age diﬀers from
commercial communication in the traditional oﬄine-world and whether it is
disinforming informed users.
Observation 1: The Amount of Available
Information in General has Risen
With the rise of the Internet, traditional media have lost their monopoly on mass
communication. Digital publication is easy, cheap, and open to anyone with
Internet access. By implication, new communicators and publications ﬂood the
net: Up to February 2016, 1,900,000 articles had been published on Wikipedia
(httpsː//tools.wmﬂabs.org/steinsplitter/Meilensteine/). At the time of writing

this introduction, 28,000 tweets were published every ﬁve seconds on Twitter
and 115 new posts appeared on a WordPress blog while ten hours of new content
was uploaded onto YouTube (http://pennystocks.la/internet-in-real-time/). Indi-
vidual and corporate publishers, professionals and nonprofessionals, communi-
cators from around the globe, shape this vivid digital-content ecosystem. In this
environment users are not just confronted with what researchers call “informa-
tion overload” (Eppler, Mengis 2004) but also with a variety of new information
sources and the challenge of evaluating them.
Among them we increasingly ﬁnd commercial organizations, expanding
their corporate communications departments and producing professional media
products to directly target their (potential) customers online – bypassing former
mediators such as newspapers, magazines or TV and radio. According to an
annual study conducted by the Content Marketing Institute, 76% of B2B marketers
surveyed and 77% of B2C marketers in North America say they will produce
more content in 2016 than they did in 2015, investing on average 28% (B2B)
and 32% (B2C) of their total marketing budget (not including staﬀ) into it
(Content Marketing Institute et al. 2016a; Content Marketing Institute et al.
2016b). Today’s media shift shows similar dynamics to previous platform transi-
tions, except for one major diﬀerence: there’s more money in digital publishing
than ever before (Altchek 2016). In the battle for users’ attention, only those
oﬀering the most attractive content win – content is king.
Users face the challenge of distinguishing information from disinformation,
trustworthy content from “bullshit” (Frankfurt 2005), and reliable sources from
all the rest. This is quite a job considering the amount of information one is
confronted with in the digital sphere – and it requires corresponding skill
sets: media awareness and advertising literacy in particular. New formats for
commercial communication often contain hidden attempts to persuade and are
sometimes not immediately recognizable as advertising by the consumer. They
challenge the ways we understand and process commercial communication and
call for extended concepts of advertising literacy (see chapter 1.2 on advertising
literacy). Even when aware of the fact that there are persuasive and camouﬂaged
forms of commercial communication and being in possession of contemporary
literacy skill sets, users would still not have the resources to consciously process
each and every piece of communication they are confronted with in the digital
sphere. Accordingly, one might wonder if the unconscious processing of com-
mercial information sets the stage for the disinforming or even manipulation of
consumers (see chapter 2.1 on human processing of commercial information in
the digital environments).

Observation 2: The Vehicles and Means of
Commercial Communication in General have
Changed
While it is becoming harder to diﬀerentiate the various forms and types of
commercial communication, the conception of communication as a process
with a sender, a recipient, a message and a vehicle to transport the message
remains the same. We can still see commercial communication as a form of
persuasive communication that seeks to inform members of a target audience
about products, services, organizations, or ideas. The key drivers that transform
commercial communication in the digital environment are interactivity, integra-
tion and personalization (Siegert 2013).
Interactivity aims at engaging the users in the various forms of commercial communica-
tion, motivating them to produce user-generated content, making them co-creators of ads,
motivating them to pass messages on (Daugherty et al. 2008). However, not every product
or campaign is suitable for a high level of interactivity and not every consumer is inter-
ested in high-level interactivity either. Often the consumer engagement is limited to liking
and sharing (Muntinga et al. 2011), but still this is a much more interactive setting than the
unidirectional communication that advertising used to be and it is made easier in multi-
directional communication networks compared to a unidirectional broadcast distribution.
Integration aims at blurring the lines of journalistic or entertainment content and com-
mercial messages either by integrating commercial messages in editorial content as in
the case of product placements (McCarty 2004; La Ferle, Edwards 2006) or by disguising
commercial communication as editorial content as it is done in formats such as traditional
infomercials (Hawthorne 1997) and advertorials (Goodlad et al. 1997), or more recently
content marketing (Pulizzi 2012; Lieb 2012), native advertising (Matteo, Zotto 2015) and
branded entertainment (de Aguilera Moyano et al. 2015; Hudson, Hudson 2006) (see
chapter 2.4 on brand journalism). Obviously integration is not new, but has been around
since the radio soap operas of the 1930s and the Camel News Caravan on 1950s television.
However, digitization, the decline of linear media, and the rise of ad-blockers made it
easier to avoid advertising and thus increase the attractiveness of integrated advertising
techniques.
Personalization aims at addressing individual consumers by using one-to-one marketing
and behavioral targeting based on all forms of data available (see chapter 3.1 on program-
matic ad-tech). In this context digitization promises to reduce the wastage that naturally
occurred in mass media based commercial communication when the target audience
does not completely match the target group of a marketer.1 Personalization shall make
the (commercial) messages more relevant (Kalyanaraman, Sundar 2006) and intimate
(Li 2009) and thus hopefully more successful (Malheiros et al. 2012).
1 As in the quote attributed to John Wannamaker, William Lever or Henry Ford: „Half the
money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.“
Introduction
3

Commercial communication always tried to meet its objectives by employing
new and diﬀerent measures. In the digital age and against the background of
interactivity, integration and personalization, online and mobile formats are at
the center of commercial communicators’ attention. By using online and mobile
measures, marketers are no longer bound to the traditional media industry in
order to reach single consumers, target groups or a mass audience. Online pre-
sentations, search engines, computational advertising and in particular social
media, changed the ways of getting in touch and communicating with people
as well as the ways of publishing and circulating stories. Although professionals
have still broader access to the diﬀerent measures, users and consumers have
more possibilities to publish, be informed, communicate and recommend than
ever before; and they reach a bigger audience with their own publications, com-
ments, and recommendations. The commercial communication industry makes
use of these new possibilities and tries to harvest user engagement in produc-
tion processes as co-creation and in distribution processes as viral word of
mouth distribution. Meanwhile creating buzz (Dye 2000) is an independent
objective of most of the commercial communication activities. Altogether, users
are increasingly important when it comes to giving meaning to commercial
messages. However, the industry has to be aware that users are not only engag-
ing in the way the industry would like but also in oppositional and critical ways,
and that they themselves can reach millions of other users and spark a ﬁrestorm
(see Prahalad, Ramaswamy 2004; See-To, Ho 2014; Thompson, Malaviya 2013;
Vallaster, Wallpach 2013) (see chapter 4.1 on user-generated internet memes).
Nevertheless, social media and personal networks have become new and im-
portant vehicles to transport commercial messages. “To involve the brand in
conversations and to achieve recommendations, advertisers do not necessarily
need journalistic services, because conversations and recommendations (word
of mouth) are based on interpersonal and network communication. For inter-
personal and network communication they need technologies, platforms or eco-
systems, not journalistic media in the traditional sense of the meaning” (Siegert
2013, p. 33).
So there is evidence that there is generally more information available – for
good or bad. Of course, not all of this information is new – much of the new
content uploaded every minute to YouTube is a duplication of what is already
there. Besides, not all information has the same relevance for the sender and
the recipient. To marketers more commercial information means that it might
be harder to cut through the clutter of alternative information, and for recipients
it means that it might be harder to identify relevant and reliable information.
People have a limited capacity to cope with ﬁrst-level information so they look
4
Gabriele Siegert, M. Bjørn von Rimscha, Stephanie Grubenmann

for second level information – that is information about information, – to assess
which is worth a closer look, just as data miners use metadata rather than the
original data to make sense of a data set. So the question is whether there is
enough metainformation available about commercial communication to allow it
to be sensibly handled?
Question 1: Has the Amount of Information
on Commercial Communication Risen
Correspondingly?
Media content, and from our perspective commercial communication is also
to be regarded as such, has become a double topic. For one thing, media profes-
sionals produce original content and recipients engage with it. However, on
top of that media producers have turned to making media content and its dis-
tribution the object of their reporting. Today, there are as many articles about
which ﬁlm has the top spot at the box oﬃce as there are traditional ﬁlm reviews
(Hayes, Bing 2004). Even recipients who do not visit a ﬁlm theater might follow
these reports since this kind of horse-race journalism creates its own fascination.
A similar trend has long been evident in the context of the Super Bowl
(Tomkovick et al. 2001). Ordinary consumers ponder beforehand which com-
panies will be featured during the advertising breaks and afterwards they dis-
cuss who had the best spot (McAllister 1999). Commercial communication,
marketing and advertising strategies become newsworthy content objects in
their own right. Like product designers before (e.g. Jonathan Ive of Apple)
marketers become celebrities2 themselves ﬁrst within the industry (Nudd et al.
2015) but increasingly so even outside of it (e.g. Dietrich Mateschitz of Red Bull)
(see chapter 1.3 on advertising professionals (failing) attempts to distance their
profession from the persuasiveness of advertising).
There are numerous archives that collect, sort and literally present all in-
stances of commercial communication, just as there is some sort of wiki for
almost any media content. These archives include commercial platforms aimed
at the industry (such as Coloribus www.coloribus.com or the AdZyklpädie
https://v2.adzyklopaedie.com/) as well as publicly funded platforms aimed at
2 The opposite trend happens at the same time: celebrities are awarded marketing titles as
described by Parekh and Zmuda (2013).

historians and other academics (such as Ads and Brands run by the Vienna Uni-
versity of Economics and Business http://www.adsandbrands.com/). However,
the biggest resource for examples of audiovisual commercial communication,
YouTube, is aimed at the general public and is also largely fed by amateurs.
With the YouTube search feature anyone can ﬁnd almost any advertising spot
ever aired and even those in production.
Apparently, marketers today believe that their own industry jargon has
become the common standard. During the European football championship,
the confectionery manufacturer Ferrero asked the consumers to collect “love-
brands” coupons, turning a marketing term into a marketing message for fans
rather than consumers. Such a strategy suggests that the company expects the
consumer to be conscious of commercial communication but apparently still
trusts the eﬀectiveness of the marketing approach.
The commercialization of the society as a whole (Schimank, Volkmann 2008)
potentially means that any human interaction is interpreted from an economic
perspective (Habermas 1985). This becomes evident in everyday language when
we “invest” in a friendship or we “sell” an idea (Mautner 2010). From this
perspective it is not all that important whether the actual amount of information
on commercial communication has risen, because there is a general perception
that any communication is at least partially commercial. While there is a diﬀer-
ence between whether any communication can be interpreted commercially or
Figure 1: Lovebrands by Ferrero
6
Gabriele Siegert, M. Bjørn von Rimscha, Stephanie Grubenmann

whether it is actually intended to be commercially eﬀective, both add to the
prevalence of the phenomenon. There is more information available about
commercial communication but the rising level of commercial communication
is disguised within a commercialization of communication in general. Individuals
might no longer be able to identify a commercial message if being asked for a
date sounds like a sales pitch. However, the call for more transparency is not
new: Forbes counted transparency among the eleven marketing trends to watch
in 2015 (Dan 2014) and Chris Brandt, chief marketing oﬃcer at Taco Bell stresses
in an interview on what marketing will look like in 2020 that “transparency [will
be] the new black” (Beer 2015). Thus, in principle information seems to be avail-
able and even the providers seem to acknowledge a demand. However, we still
have to ask the question whether information about commercial communication
is actually accessible.
Question 2: Is this Amount of Information about
Commercial Communication Accessible?
Consumers at all times have had their share of creating brand stories, since
branding is just as much attribution (brand image) as it is self-portrayal (brand
identity). However, at present the participation of users and consumers seems to
be so comprehensive that some authors speak of “co-creation”. There is reason
to believe that users and consumers might be more informed about the objec-
tives and persuasive tricks of the advertising industry and are more prepared to
get in on advertising campaigns than ever before. There is also a good chance
that advertisers can inform about products and services without the limitations
of time and place of the traditional mass media. But do we really face a time
when advertisers and consumers will meet on a level playing ﬁeld, where they
have equal opportunities and power? Or does tracking users on and oﬄine lead
to a situation where advertisers have more information about consumers than
ever before, often without the user being fully aware of it? Regulation might
not help in this context as long as e.g. the European Court of Justice neglects
protection requirements of less well informed individuals and simply assumes
reasonably well informed and observant consumers (see chapter 2.2. on the
European consumer information model). However, even qualitative and exhaus-
tive information cannot guide users through the digital space if they do not
possess the skills to “read” (understand, process and apply) it. This makes
advertising literacy a core competency in a world highly characterized by com-
mercial communication.
Introduction

The volume discusses these and related issues in chapters dealing with
“information and disinformation about advertising”, “information and disinfor-
mation through advertising”, “information about users” and a chapter on “users’
inclusion in the creation of advertising”. It brings together contributions from
authors of diﬀerent countries.
Structure of the Book
1 Information and Disinformation about Advertising
The ﬁrst part of the book addresses the question of what consumers know about
advertising: what information or disinformation is available and what do they
do about it? The ﬁrst chapter in this section by Kati Förster and Ulrike Weish
deals with advertising critics – individuals or organizations that try to inform
the public about potentially problematic aspects of advertising. This can be the
reinforcement of stereotypes, the reproduction of a social order that is deemed
unfair or the observation of an excessive materialism that is attributed to adver-
tising. The second chapter by Patricia Núñez Gomez and Liisa Irene Hänninen
addresses the question of advertising literacy. Do consumers actually have the
sovereignty, composure, and reﬂectivity they are ascribed by the advertising
industry? The authors ﬁrst discuss the advertising literacy of young people and
subsequently reﬂect on the working methodology and some practical experiences
for the teaching of “advertising related literacies” to communication students at
the university. The third chapter takes a diﬀerent perspective: Jörg Tropp starts
with the observation that there is indeed more information available on com-
mercial communication. He discusses the “Cannes Lions”, International Festival
of Creativity, to show that much of this information is self-referential, creating a
postmodern marketing communication that fails to dissolve the logic of tradi-
tional advertising as it provides the audiences with the disinformation that
advertising might no longer be advertising. Thus, advertising might not be the
best source of information about commercial communication. This aspect is dis-
cussed in more detail in the second part of the book where we gather chapters
that deal with questions concerning information or disinformation that can
actually be transmitted in advertising messages.
2 Information and Disinformation through Advertising
Roland Mangold provides the basis for this part dealing with the question of
whether commercial communication can be considered eﬀective in a digital

environment where numberless communicators ﬁght for the users’ attention. He
presents selected results from active psychological research and discusses the
framework of a limited-capacity model of human information processing to
answer this question. Gert Straetmans approaches the topic from a legal and
consumer-protection perspective. He critically discusses the information paradigm
that the European consumer information model is based on, assuming that con-
sumers are beneﬁt-maximising creatures and integrates recent developments in
the ﬁeld. In the third contribution of this section, Brigitte Naderer, Desirée
Schmuck and Jörg Matthes approach the matter with a topic-centered perspec-
tive. They investigate the advertising practice called “greenwashing” which over-
states or even falsiﬁes the environmental impact of commercial oﬀerings. The
authors present diﬀerent types of greenwashing and its eﬀect on consumers.
Ángel Arrese and Francisco J. Pérez-Latre open our perspective up in the direc-
tion of journalism, discussing the rise of “brand journalism”. By managing brand
content from a journalistic perspective and applying news media standards, the
authors consider brand journalism as a “modern marketing imperative”. In their
contribution, they describe the eﬀects of brand journalism on user engagement
and discuss its contribution to the tension between information and misinforma-
tion in markets.
3 Information about Users
In the third section of this volume, authors present diﬀerent perspectives on the
monitoring and exploitation of user data in the digital sphere. Andrew McStay
opens the section with his assessment of programmatic advertising. Sensitive to
time, users’ location and interests, this contemporary form of advertising
reaches individuals across a variety of screens. The author discusses related
potentials and the underlying interaction concept which integrates develop-
ments in ﬁnance, liquidity and high-frequency trading and aspires intelligent
interactions with users' life context. Rolf H. Weber and Florent Thouvenin
approach the development of consumer and citizen tracking from a rather
critical perspective, by raising legal and ethical questions. The authors discuss
implications for the long-term success of Internet businesses and demand full
transparency with regard to the entire process of collecting and using informa-
tion about consumers. Otto Petrovic closes this section on data collection with
his discussion of the Internet of Things as a disruptive innovation. Analys-
ing early implementations in health and ﬁtness, the author presents the ﬁrst
signs of the tremendous impact this innovation will have on the advertising eco-
system.
Introduction

4 Inclusion of Users in the Creation of Advertising
In the last section, we direct our attention to users’ integration into advertising
processes. Chris Miles opens the section with a rather broad and critical perspec-
tive on the topic: derived from detailed analyses of texts and practitioners’ talk,
which provides the foundational thinking behind the concept, he identiﬁes
serious tensions between the desire of traditional marketing for control over
consumers and the principles of marketing co-creation. In his conclusion, he
presents co-creation as a form of disinformation that aids marketing in mis-
directing attention away from its crisis of relevancy. M. Elena Aramendia-Muneta
complements this critical perspective on co-creation with her assessment of elec-
tronic word of mouth. Stating that eWOM can disseminate both information
and disinformation, she stresses the ambivalent character of eWOM resulting in
challenges for users and marketers. Tamás Csordás, Dóra Horváth, Ariel Mitev
and Éva Markos-Kujbus close the chapter – and the volume – with another
co-creation aspect on a linguistic level: the use of user-generated Internet memes
as advertising vehicles. The authors propose a hitherto neglected business per-
spective on the appearance of branded contents in the expression of personal
messages by working with the concept of memetics.

1.1 Advertising Critique: Themes,
Actors and Challenges in a Digital Age
Abstract: Ever since advertising emerged, both its functions and threats have
been debated. The themes of advertising ethics and critique are multifaceted;
the majority relate to the depiction of violence, hypersexualization and various
“-isms” (e.g. ageism). The digital environment has added new aspects to the
topic; respondents primarily worry about their loss of control, transparency and
privacy. At the same time, the Internet provides a platform for critical voices –
from keeping informed via the signing of petitions against certain advertising
practices, to becoming an advertising activist her- or himself. This chapter
addresses the current state of advertising critique in this digital environment. It
will give an overview of the dominant themes and important actors and drivers
of advertising critique. Furthermore, obstacles and stumbling stones for both
research and practice are discussed and challenges identiﬁed.
The critique of advertising is as old as advertising itself; its pros and cons have
been debated ever since advertising emerged. From its economic impact (e.g.
Albion, Farris 1981 via the controversy about its eﬀects on excessive materialism
(e.g. Drumwright 2007), to its role in protecting the existing social order by
promoting inequality, particularly in terms of race and gender (O’Guinn 2007) –
the themes are multifaceted and driven by diﬀerent actors with speciﬁc, often
opposing interests. Without doubt, we are surrounded by advertising in its
diﬀerent forms, and sometimes advertising placements take grotesque shapes
which aﬀect and change our familiar patterns of reception in formerly advertis-
ing free areas, such as sports (everyone is used to it nowadays) and even religion,
as the photograph in Figure 1 shows.
Thereby, the importance of advertising for individuals and the society is
undoubted. Potter even ascribed to advertising the role of an “instrument of
social control” (2009, p. 175) and suggested that “advertising now compares with
such long-standing institutions as the school and the church in the magnitude
of its social inﬂuence” (2009, p. 167). In fact, scholars and professionals alike
have highlighted advertisers’ responsibility in promoting societal wellbeing
(e.g. Baker, Martinson 2001; Cunningham, P. 1999; Waller 2012). However, since
the beginning of advertising, the debates surrounding ethical standards for
advertising revolve around the same, enduring themes and thus seem to be at
a “dead end”.

As an example, in his seminal work on the role of advertising Pollay (1986)
sets out the question as to whether advertising is a mirror of society, or whether it
acts as an agent of change. Since then, this question has been asked repeatedly.
Nevertheless the basic premise behind this question is: who is to blame for the
harm advertising can cause? In other words, if advertising is a mirror of society,
Figure 1: Votive Church, Vienna, in March 2016 (own photograph)
16

then the industry is not to blame, but we all are. If we do not like the ads,
we should stop watching the program they are in and we should certainly stop
buying the products. But if we respond (as the advertisers intend), then we have
no one to blame but ourselves. On the other hand, if advertising is the agent of
change, then – according to Pardun – “It’s advertising’s fault we’re the way we
are.” (2014, p. 3). Of course, it is not that simple and in many cases both situa-
tions apply.
Staying within this duty-based1 perspective on advertising critique, one has
to ask: who sets the moral and ethical principles advertising should be based
on? To lay this duty on the advertising industry alone is questionable. Murphy
(1998) argues with the “unholy trinity”. He states: “[a]dvertisers, agencies, and
the media represent the three main parties in any advertising campaign. Among
these three parties, it appears no one is willing to accept primary responsibility
for raising ethical standards. Consequently, ethics in advertising is perceived to
be rather low.” (1998, p. 318). On top of that, the digital environment nowadays
adds a new aspect and complexity to the topic.
Based on interviews with industry leaders, Drumwright and Murphy (2009)
found that the ethical issues presented by new digital media are diﬀerent. To put
it simply, the respondents are largely concerned with the advertiser’s loss of
control, and issues of transparency and privacy. The ethical arena arising in the
Internet and blogosphere was characterized as the “Wild West” – “a rough and
tough, no-holds-barred context in which the regulations, guidelines and con-
trols of traditional media are absent.” (2009, p. 87). In response, a number of
diﬀerent groups who question advertising practices in general and who debate
their individual and social consequences have been formed. Ranging from indi-
vidual net activists who denounce sexisms by mocking advertisements to NGOs
engaging in a critique of general consumerism, to the self-regulatory institutions
of the advertising industry itself – the list of the various agents in advertising
critique is long and diverse.
In this chapter we will discuss the current state of advertising critique in the
digital environment, both from a research and a practical perspective. We will
sketch its historical roots and the consequent dominant themes within this inter-
disciplinary ﬁeld of interest. In doing so we will (1) identify important actors and
1 Duty-based ethics, also referred to as deontological ethics, is based on the assumption that
some acts are right or wrong in themselves, regardless of the good or bad consequences that
may be produced. Under this form of ethics and ethical questioning one cannot justify an action
by showing that it produced good consequences. Accordingly, the theory of deontology would
state that advertisers and individuals are morally obligated to act in accordance with a certain
set of principles and rules regardless of the outcome.

drivers of advertising critique, (2) discuss extant barriers and incompatibilities
within the discipline, and (3) propose future directions, especially with regard
to the digital and mobile environment of which advertising is a part.
1 The Roots of Research on Advertising Critique
Advertising critique and advertising ethics is an area of research that is driven
by manifold interests and disciplines – rooted in philosophy, advertising ethics
has branched into many ﬁelds. This is also due to the fact that advertising has
various shapes depending on the point of view. First, advertising can be viewed
as part of product promotion and thus as a vital ingredient of a marketing
and branding strategy. According to Bohrmann (1997) advertising is primarily
a planned attempt to inﬂuence individuals’ opinions, attitudes and behavior
about products, services, brands and companies with communication activities
in order to reach economic goals. In this marketing context advertising ethics
is therefore only a single aspect of a (much wider) research area investigating
advertising’s eﬀects on aspects of image, brand attitudes or buying intentions.
Second, and closely related to this, advertising is viewed as a form of persuasive
communication and as such is a subject of communication research. Here
advertising research does not only focus on economic advertising, but also in-
cludes social and political advertising. Willems (1999) referred here to a strategic
rationality that is implied by advertising. However, Bohrmann (2010) highlights
that the attempt to inﬂuence, to persuade, to sway may not be bad or ethically
illegitimate per se. Both the economic and the communication science perspec-
tive on advertising are primarily settled in the micro perspective and focus
chieﬂy on the short-term eﬀects of speciﬁc stimuli by drawing on psychology
and experimental paradigms (Drumwright 2007). In contrast, the third view
understands advertising as public communication. This macro perspective con-
centrates on the aggregate eﬀects of advertising, including advertising to vulner-
able segments (Boniﬁeld, Cole 2007) and advertising’s role in consumption and
collective welfare (O’Guinn 2007). A common criticism of advertising from the
macro level is that it protects the existing social order and promotes inequality,
particularly in terms of race, class and gender (O’Guinn 2007).
Drumwright (2007) has categorized social criticism of advertising on the
macro level according to its three primary critiques: advertising encourages
excessive materialism, advertising engenders and/or reinforces problematic stereo-
types, and advertising cultivates false values and thus problematic behavior. In
this context philosophy with its question of individual and collective ethical
18
Kati Förster and Ulrike Weish

guidelines plays a vital role. Advertising ethics can thereby be discussed within
diﬀerent philosophical perspectives (Förster, Brantner 2016). As an example, the
utilitarian perspective builds on principles by asking what is best for all, or the
greatest number of people possible (Mill 2003). For Mill moral reasoning “was
equivalent to calculating consequences for human happiness” (Christians 2007,
p. 118), that is, utilitarianism requires advertisers to maximize happiness for all
(Cunningham, A. 1999). Another position is social contract theory, which high-
lights that a person’s moral obligations depend on a contract among them to
form the society in which they live (Friend 2004). Rawls (1971) here argues that
the best society would be formed by principles of justice chosen by rational
citizens behind a veil of ignorance, in which their own social status and goals
would not aﬀect their decisions. Hence, practitioners need orientation and useful
criteria “to step conceptually out of their roles as powerful disseminators of
persuasive promotional messages and to evaluate the equity of the appeal from
the perspective of the weaker parties” (Baker, Martinson 2001, p. 166).
2 Challenges for Advertising Critique in the
Digital Age
With digitalization the scope and scale of ethical questions have increased.
Tanyel, Stuart and Griﬃn (2013) date the beginning of Internet advertising back
to 1994. During these last two decades it has evolved from placing banners to a
wide variety of Internet techniques including video banners, viral marketing,
rich media, social networking, search engine marketing, blogs, in-game adver-
tising, emails, micro sites, user-generated content, mobile marketing and so
forth (see the chapter on programmatic ad-tech in this volume).
One of the main issues in the digital advertising age refers to privacy and
behavioral targeting. It is, without question, at the same time the biggest oppor-
tunity for advertisers as the collecting of data allows for the identiﬁcation of
consumers via cookies placed on their devices tracking all their online activities
(Snyder 2011). Advertisers use these data to better target audiences in order to
direct more speciﬁc ads to them. These data are also used to predict future
behavior via the search for “statistical twins”. The availability of these (big)
data bringing light into every single characteristic of our online behavior –
from shopping via searching to media use – is probably the biggest threat from
an ethical standpoint, because it raises questions of privacy. Privacy is con-
cerned with the right of persons to determine what, to whom and to what extent
Advertising Critique: Themes, Actors and Challenges in a Digital Age
19

they want to disclose information about themselves. The right of privacy, also
widely regarded with the “general right of an individual to be let alone“, was
formulated and published by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis in the Harvard
Law Review in 1890 for the ﬁrst time, a long time before the Internet was
invented. In their seminal article the authors claimed:
“Recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next step which must be taken
for the protection of the person, and for securing to the individual what Judge Cooley calls the
right “to be let alone”. Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded
the sacred precincts of private and domestic life; and numerous mechanical devices threaten
to make good the prediction that “what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from
the house-tops.” (Warren, Brandeis 1890, § 4).
Although the amount and type of data collected about users have changed,
privacy issues and thus transparency are still an important aspect (Drumwright,
Murphy 2009). In other words, one of the main tasks for critique and the ethics
of digital advertising is to provide transparency about the way these data are
collected and used and, moreover, to get users informed about their rights and
to give them an opt-out opportunity.
A second challenge for digital advertising, and currently often discussed,
is native advertising, a form of advertising that matches the appearance of the
platform on which it is published. In other words, within the practice of native
advertising “advertisers create or sponsor content intended to blend in with
the editorial content” (Carlson 2015, p. 850). This, of course, raises questions
about the blurring of lines between editorial and business operations in the
media. It is clearly associated with endangering journalistic ethics, or as Carlson
(2015, p. 850) puts it: “The close connection between journalistic autonomy and
authority supports a separation between a news organization’s editorial and
business functions, both internally through their discrete operations and in the
news product through the unambiguous marking of what is editorial and what
is advertising. These distinctions feed into the strictures of journalistic profes-
sionalism and the ideal that journalists be left alone to control their jurisdiction
without interference”. From the perspective of advertising ethics native advertis-
ing “betrays” potential consumers by pretending to be editorial content. This
undermines the credibility of just the media that need to reach audiences; they
somehow kill the golden goose. The growing practice of native advertising in
digital media is the more surprising and thus superﬂuous as advertising has
begun to be perceived itself as entertainment. So the question arises: what kind
of audiences can really be reached with native advertising and what will be the
“price” for this illusion and betrayal in the long run (see the chapter on brand
journalism in this volume)?

3 Agents of Advertising Critique
A majority of advertising critique practices relate to images and visual commu-
nication: from ads depicting an excess of violence (so called shock advertising:
Dahl et al. 2003, p. 268) to hypersexualized ads., e.g. children in sexualized
postures (so called Lolita chic: Durham 2008) or a general “porn chic” (Gill
2007a, p. 73), to diﬀerent kinds of “everyday” “-isms” such as exotism, post-
colonial symbolism and hierarchies (Frith, Mueller 2010), and ageism (Carrigan,
Szmigin 1999) – we see a multitude of diﬀerent forms of oﬀense in ads. Most
of the ads violating ethics with regard to sexism; e.g. by sexualization without
any product context (so called “eye-catcher advertising”), trivialization and
depreciation of persons depicted through postures, objects, clothing, subtle or
obvious slogans in the style of “old-boys’ jokes”, re-traditionalization using
obsolete stereotypes which mainly depict women in obsequious poses. Also
images of men as photo models or celebrities are almost exclusively assigned to
a hegemonial manhood (Connell 2005): often young and white, slim, muscular,
potent, heterosexual and ﬁnancially independent – advertising subjects predomi-
nantly symbolize physical and mental strength, sportiness, risk and competition
orientation, but also protection and safety. These traditional visual postures in
advertising, although well known since the 1970s (Schmerl 1994, p. 134), are still
alive, despite massive feminist, scientiﬁc and political critique.
The agents of advertising critique questioning these advertising practices and
debating their individual and social consequences can be roughly categorized
into three groups (besides legal regulation2): (1) actors of a general consumerism
critique, (2) self-regulation by the branch itself, and (3) advertising interest groups
of civil society.
4 Actors of a General Consumerism Critique
“The mercantile juggernaut has moved in or swarmed over (. . .) Our historically treasured
cultural values are either viewed as marketing impediments – such as democratic tools for
civic assertiveness – or are commandeered, co-opted, or outright commodiﬁed in the service
of corporate proﬁts.” (Ralph Nader quoted in Jacobson, Mazur 1995, p. 8)
2 This includes international law (e.g. CEDAW, UN law against discrimination of women in the
media), European (e.g. EU guidelines on audiovisual media) and national law (e.g. Pornogra-
ﬁegesetz (BGBI), AMD-G, ORF-G, Gleichbehandlungsgesetz). For an overview and detailed infor-
mation see Kappel 2013b and the chapter on trade practices and consumer disinformation in
this volume.

21

Advertising critique has always been part of a general consumption and com-
mercialization critique. It has been stated that commercialism and the dominant
promotion of materialism (Jacobson, Mazur 1995) aﬀect both consumers’ minds
and extraction of natural resources leading to enormous levels of superﬂuous
production. Within aﬄuent societies a high level of throw-away products are
manufactured, many of them depleting basic resources such as water, air, soil
and land, oil, carbon and metal ores. As a consequence, it has been argued
that advertising in general is stealing people’s time, especially children’s atten-
tion and, moreover, it engenders conformism. Furthermore, the structure of
marketing and advertising is undermining civic institutions (Barber 2007) and
the whole media system (Baker 1994; Bourdieu 1998; Collins 1992). As the main
revenue source for the media, advertising aﬀects all parts of society: profes-
sional sports, schools and universities, the public space, public transportation,
arts, politics, even the structures of nonproﬁt organizations and religions. In
this wider sense of (a more radical) advertising critique we have a variety of
diﬀerent actors and areas of tension, primarily focusing on advertising’s role in
the commercialization and commodiﬁcation of the public sector.
Advertising critique is closely connected with its role in a general “econo-
mization” of the public sphere. As an example, Galbraith (1958) outlined segre-
gation in modern industrial societies between the public and the private sectors.
In the public sector, especially in the Western capitalistic systems with their
tradition of economic liberalism, free education, hospitals, public social welfare,
public transportation and other services, go unﬁlled or become precarious: “The
community is aﬄuent in privately produced goods. . . It is poor in the public
services” (1958, p. 315). With increasing ﬁnancial pressure in the public sector,
more and more former public responsibilities are actually reduced or “econo-
mized”. Marketing interests and advertising logics have thus ﬁlled up the new
spaces of a commercialized environment in postmodern society.
This is also the subject of Habermas’ theory of a bourgeois public sphere
(1990). It begins with the assumption that the public sphere needs public access
by all citizens in order to guarantee access to knowledge, media, public spaces,
rational considerations and information, access to communicative negotiations –
free of domination and pari passu. Accordingly, Habermas believes that, ideally,
better arguments should assert qua prudence and not the argument of the most
powerful lobbyists or the advertising strategists with the most salient images
in public spaces. The public sphere is thus not an arena of market based, but
discursive relationships, a stage for debating and deliberating instead of buying
and selling (Fraser 2001, p. 109). In other words and following this line of argu-
ment, if private organizations replace public institutions the democratic core
22
Kati Förster and Ulrike Weish

of civil liberty will be destroyed and – instead – be driven by market-based
individual interests (Barber 2007). These presumptions do not only require an
ongoing debate about the value of public goods, it also calls for the existence
of a free (social) science independent of ﬁnancial interests. Its actors should be
free to reveal, describe and report the ﬁndings of independent investigations
and normative appeals.
To sum up, intellectuals debating the role of advertising as a whole in the
public sphere have always been important agents for the critique of advertising.
5 Self-Regulatory Institutions
“Tout s’achète: l’amour, l’art, la planète Terre, vous, moi [. . .]” (Beigbeder 2000, p. 15)
The advertising industry addresses its responsibility for ethical standards through
self-regulatory bodies. Self-regulatory bodies are typically established by the
communication industry itself (e.g. media, advertisers, advertising and media
agencies) and societal organizations (e.g. universities, lawyers, chambers of
commerce) in order – according to their self-declarations – to maintain a high
quality of advertising and ensure consumer trust and protection for the beneﬁt
of the industry as a whole. In the US the Federal Trade Commission – an
independent agency of the US government – regulates advertising. This is
complemented by the Advertising Self-Regulatory Council (ASRC; see Advertis-
ing Self-Regulatory Council 2016). In Europe many countries also have self-
regulatory bodies that are responsible for listening to complaints from the
public and establishing whether or not a particular ad or campaign should be
withdrawn. In Europe, internal or self-regulation is implemented by the Euro-
pean Advertising Standards Alliance (2016), of which currently 38 self-regulatory
bodies are members: 27 from 25 European countries and 11 from non-European
countries, including India, Australia, Brazil, Peru, and Canada (Förster, Brantner
2016).
The various advertising councils follow ethic codices and self-regulatory
principles. As an example, the ethical guidelines of the American Association
of Advertising Agencies, funded in 1924 and revisited in 2011, proclaims:
“Speciﬁcally, we will not knowingly create advertising that contains: a) False or
misleading statements or exaggerations, visual or verbal, b) Testimonials that do
not reﬂect the real opinion of the individual(s) involved, c) Price claims that
are misleading, d) Claims insuﬃciently supported or that distort the true mean-
ing or practicable application of statements made by professional or scientiﬁc
authority, e) Statements, suggestions, or pictures oﬀensive to public decency or

23

minority segments of the population.” (American Association of Advertising
Agencies 2011). These criteria are generally embedded in most of the ethical
codes of self-regulation in Western countries.
Through these self-regulatory bodies practitioners are not only – more or
less – active players in advertising critique, but as agents of production so to
speak, they are at the same time the subject of their own critique. This, of
course, creates contradictions and conﬂicts of interest. The advertising industry
is itself characterized by a multiplicity of specializations and consequent frag-
mentation, a general “youthism” within the creative scene and a high level of
ﬂuctuation. This is aggravated by the prevailing market logic, speciﬁc working
conditions, aesthetic decisions, dependence on clients’ budgets and marketing
goals. In fact, the main driver is “freshness” – new products, new aesthetic
codes and the rupture of taboos and rules are the scoops of the advertising
industry; they guarantee personal success. Criticizing your own business thus
in no small measure comes with a risk. So we can assume that whistleblowing
and a critical voice can only be aﬀorded by those who do not risk losing their
jobs or who are not subject to the adjustment pressure of big companies. Given
this, self-regulatory institutions are even more important as a “safe haven”
for those individuals active in advertising critique that have concerns about
practices in their own guild.
6 Groups of Interest in Civil Society
In many cases the established self-regulation system was not able to modify the
still extant oﬀenses in advertising and myths such as “sex sells”. As an example,
the European Council requested in this context higher ethical standards for the
depiction of under-aged models with regard to the target group of girls and
young women, but without creating new prohibitions or legal regulations for
advertising. The Council takes three groups to task: advertisers as the producers,
the media as distribution authority and the public as critical consumers (Council
of Europe 2007). Hence, the question arises of how civil society accepts its
responsibility in developing a higher sensitivity for oﬀenses in advertising not
only with regard to sexism, but advertising ethics in general.
6.1 Advertising Watch Groups
An example of civil engagement in advertising critique are the local watch
groups, as established in Austria (Vienna, Graz and Salzburg). They provide a
24
Kati Förster and Ulrike Weish

platform for complaints regarding sexism in advertising. Based on Goﬀman’s
seminal study (1979) and enhanced by newer empirical results regarding gender
and stereotypes (Holtz-Bacha 2011; Kautt 2012; Schmerl 1994; Wilk 2002), a
catalog of criteria has been developed by the group that serves as basis for
decisions as to whether an advertisement is oﬀensive or not (Kappel 2013a).
The decisions of the group are published on the website, but are also picked
up by the mass media.
6.2 Journalists and Amateurs
The Internet provides an open space within the battle for visibility, attention
and prominence: anyone can write blogs or articles, and anyone can uncover
grievances that may be picked up by professional journalists who catapult
them into the mass media. Never before has it been so easy to reach audiences,
to distribute messages, to communicate critical activities and to criticize com-
panies, brands and international corporations. One of the more prominent
examples is the mock advertising of a blogger who calls herself “The Militant
Baker”. She took the style of advertising of Abercrombie & Fitch, known for
not selling plus-sizes but for “cool, good-looking people”, and replaced it with
herself and the slogan “Attractive & Fat” (see Figure 2). The campaign went viral
and caught the attention of mass media outlets who then reported it. This
demonstrates how the Internet helps individuals to express and publish their
critique of advertising practices independently of the access barriers of tradi-
tional media.

But the mass media and thus professional journalists also take action to
bring ethical oﬀenses in advertising to public attention. Just one example among
many is the lemon, a negative award that dieStandard, an online outlet of an
Austrian quality newspaper, has dedicated to sexist advertisements and media
content since 2010.
6.3 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO)
NGOs are a signiﬁcant part of a general consumerism and also of advertising
critique. They include organizations for feminism, antiracism, anti-violence,
consumer protection, or environmental groups. As an example, the Clean Clothes
Campaign (CCC) (2016) is a non-governmental organization that denounces the
working conditions of the garment industry worldwide and thereby criticizes
global brands by showing the divergence between their advertisements and
real production conditions. The ﬁrst CCC group was founded in Amsterdam in
the late 1980s as a reaction to the bad working conditions of textile workers,
mostly female, in low-wage countries. The CCC was also successful in other
countries and meanwhile there are Clean Clothes groups in 15 European countries.
The central question of production conditions in globalized mass production
also became popular when Naomi Klein published her book “No Logo” in 2000.
She demonstrated that big brand corporations do not use proﬁt margins to
improve working conditions, but instead proﬁts are diverted to marketing
and advertising budgets. Hence Klein’s conclusion is that the new capitalistic
competition of global players takes place at the advertising level in order to
gain the attention of well-funded elites worldwide and in Western countries in
particular as the central addressees of their products (Klein 2000). This macro-
economic process described by Klein sixteen years ago, is still extant in interna-
tional production. Although corporations and brands have weathered countless
“shitstorms” following accidental deaths (e.g. in the textile industry) and have
published many CSR reports about ecological responsibility and working condi-
tions, this logic of production is still an on-going practice (Frith, Mueller 2010).
Besides work and human rights, especially in developing countries, the
struggle for natural resources is central to consumer and advertising critique.
In recent decades environmental groups have been active in order to prevent
ecological damage, such as deforestation, soil erosion, unﬁltered chemicals
and toxic spills from industrial waste, land appropriation for mono cultures
(palm oil, soy, cotton, etc.) and genetically modiﬁed seeds and fertilizers (e.g.,
Monsanto, Novartis). One example from the number of NGOs, environmental
groups and individuals is Vandana Shiva, an Indian activist, physicist, biologist
26
Kati Förster and Ulrike Weish

and receiver of the alternative Nobel Prize. She reported about the struggle of
small farmers for essential access to water from the regional springs that were
privatised to the Coca-Cola Corporation. This grassroots movement became
public by ﬁrst regional and then international media coverage. However, it was
diﬃcult to get the mass media to report the incident because Coca-Cola is an
important advertiser and as such is important to a lot of media companies
(Shiva 2002).
These examples illustrate two vital aspects: ﬁrst, NGOs have an important
role in advertising critique as they become more and more professional in their
online communication activities. As such they are a source for critical journalistic
reporting for the traditional media, but even more so for the growing alternative
media (e.g. VICE). Second, the Internet is central to the independent publicizing
of these practices and to the distribution of petitions against the destructive
behavior of global players. Meanwhile there are various websites providing a
platform to enter petitions (e.g. ipetitions.com; change.org). Petitions against
advertising practices make up a large part of theses websites, which illustrates
that civil society is undeniably an important actor in advertising critique.
6.4 Educators
Another important group in active advertising critique are educators in kinder-
gardens, schools and universities, as well as parents who engage in projects
dealing with consumption critique, production conditions and participation in
the economy. One main issue here is “pinkiﬁcation” and “gender marketing”
that perpetuates traditional role models for girls and boys. “Pink Stinks” for
example, is a campaign against gender stereotypes in marketing, production
and distribution, especially for children. A group of critical consumers and
parents founded the initiative in Great Britain in 2012 and they mostly criticize
advertising by the toy industry, e.g. Lego Friends, Barbie. The communication
was almost exclusively conducted via Internet blogs and social media, but has
been picked up by the traditional mass media. Meanwhile there are active “Pink
Stinks” groups in Germany (Cologne, Hamburg, see Pink stinks 2015). The group
thus stands for critical consumers who expect and convey gender equality and
diversity in advertising and do so in the public space (Völzmann 2014). Pink
Stinks organizes workshops in schools and theaters for children; they address
their critique of stereotypes to the mainstream media, especially regarding
speciﬁc TV shows. The group became famous in Germany and Austria with their
protest against the casting show “Germany’s Next Topmodel” (Brummert 2016).

6.5 Artists
Another type of advertising critique is activism in the arts. It transports social
critique to a diﬀerent level and provides social criticism and new interpretations.
Advertising in particular is a vital element of popular cultural critical formations
making hip fashion regalia, body dramatics and the politics of the image visible
and emotionally readable. Since Warhol’s Pop Art at least, the boundaries
between commerce and art culture have been blurred. Artists pick up extremes
in advertising representations; they reﬂect them and critically expose image
reception. Also, political and symbolical activism such as “Subvertisement” or
“Culture Jamming” (Lasn 2005) and Adbusting (Klein 2000) are speciﬁc creative
and subversive actions to imitate and thereby ironically treat brand communica-
tion. Meanwhile there are a number of critical magazines and websites that deal
with this subcultural and dissident practice of advertising critique (Adbusters
2016).
7 Obstacles for Advertising Critique
The discussion shows that advertising critique is borne by a multiplicity of
single activities and agents. Furthermore, research on advertising ethics takes
place within diﬀerent disciplines (such as marketing, communication science,
sociology, political science, philosophy), mostly without reference to each other.
But the question arises, of why advertising ethics and critique as subject of
research seems to be at a dead end, as incipiently mentioned, revolving around
the same themes and – ﬁnally – around itself. The reasons can primarily be
located in three aspects: (1) the lack of objectivity, (2) the lack of acceptance,
and (3) the lack of continuity.
7.1 The Lack of Objectivity
Advertising critique suﬀers from ambiguities of representation in visuals, lan-
guage or their interaction. There are, of course, ethical oﬀenses that violate our
basic assumptions of what is right; i.e. they are wrong at ﬁrst sight. These
include for instance deception in advertisements, depictions of violence or
sexual representations of children. But the majority of oﬀenses in advertising
depend on interpretation, they use traditional stereotypes and are thus sexist,
they perpetuate outdated gender role expectations, operate with the objectiﬁca-
tion of women, depict disabled people as helpless victims, and thereby aﬀect
28
Kati Förster and Ulrike Weish

our image of certain groups in society. This is closely connected with negotiated
meanings in popular cultures and the feminist research into advertising that is
rooted in this tradition. Furthermore and as an additional side note, in feminist
research, objectivity as a quality criterion is seen as a hegemonic trick of male
dominated science and the male dominated production of pictures, body repre-
sentations and reading/decoding versions.
As an example, Laura Mulvey, a British feminist ﬁlm theorist, employed
Freud and Lacan’s ideas to the cinematic aesthetics of patriarchal Hollywood
cinema and found two distinct modes of the male gaze in the 1950s and 1960s,
i.e. “voyeuristic” (seeing woman as image “to be looked at”) and “fetishistic”
(i.e. seeing woman as a substitute for “the lack”, the underlying psychoanalytic
fear of castration). These “male gaze” narratives and aesthetics are still extant in
both ﬁlms and advertising, but have developed new forms of representation
(Mulvey 1975).
Gill (2007b) speaks here of a postfeminist media culture “as a distinctive
sensibility, made up of a number of interrelated themes. These include the
notion that femininity is a bodily property; the shift from objectiﬁcation to sub-
jectiﬁcation; an emphasis upon self-surveillance, monitoring and self-discipline;
a focus on individualism, choice and empowerment; the dominance of a make-
over paradigm; and a resurgence of ideas about natural sexual diﬀerence”
(2007b, p. 147).
This transformation in depictions and representations makes it even harder
to detect sexist oﬀenses in advertising, or as Gill puts it: “feminism is now part
of the cultural ﬁeld. . . Feminist-inspired ideas burst forth from our radios, televi-
sion screens and print media in TV [. . .] However, it would be entirely false
to suggest that the media has somehow become feminist and has adopted
unproblematically a feminist perspective. [. . .] What makes contemporary media
culture distinctively postfeminist, rather than pre-feminist or anti-feminist is
precisely this entanglement of feminist and anti-feminist ideas [. . .] A certain
kind of liberal feminist perspective is treated as common sense, while at the
same time feminism and feminists are constructed as harsh, punitive and in-
authentic, not articulating women’s true desire.” (2007b, p. 161). The transfor-
mation of popular culture in postmodernism is characterized by ambivalence,
double binds, ironic symbols and quotable repetitions (McRobbie 2009). Hence,
unambiguity and consistency, requirements in quantitative science, are not
quality criteria in themselves in this context of decoding in a broader process
of social change. The latter leads us to the next “stumbling block” for advertis-
ing critique – the lack of acceptance.

29

7.2 The Lack of Acceptance
Advertising critique suﬀers from its lack of acceptance for diﬀerent reasons.
First, oﬀensive advertising causes collateral damage in groups who do not ﬁt
into the target groups of heteronormativity, purchasing power and whiteness.
These groups are not primarily the addressees or target group of most of the
brands, but they are reached by the brand communication, they are aﬀected by
it and sometimes they feel humiliated and insulted. This is especially the case
for groups such as ethnic minorities and their religious values, economically
precarious individuals, the aged and physically disabled, LGBT communities.
All of these see a heteronormative world of white, well-funded middle-class
families or winner types of high status within the perfect idyll of product presen-
tations. These groups are economically not as relevant as the target groups.
Hence, it is not until it becomes an issue for the targeted groups that the ‘sensi-
tivities’ of the collateral groups come to the fore, at least for the majority of
brands. Second, the lack of acceptance of advertising critique is due to its
perceived ineﬃcacy. Advertising critique always comes into play after an adver-
tisement has been aired; thus the critique is always late. Advertising never
comes to an end, even if campaigns are stopped, designs are criticized or visual
practices are scandalized. In this logic of daily routines, advertising critique is
always behind, trails behind stimuli and incidents – especially in digital envi-
ronments. Third, advertising critique is not comfortable. It has the ideological
stamp of a buzzkill: antiquated, priggish, critical of capitalism and thus tenden-
tiously radical. This negative image of advertising critique could also be the
reason for the brittle research traditions in this question that – consequently –
leads to a lack of continuity in research (Holtz-Bacha 2011, p. 15; Blake 2015,
p. 3).
7.3 The Lack of Continuity
Academic life and activities have their own logic and mechanisms. In times of
ﬁnancial cutbacks in universities, individual research activities are more and
more driven by economic interests (e.g. contract research to be able to ﬁnance
studies) and publication mechanisms. In other words, the subject of research
topics is aﬀected by the demands of the private sector of the economy (some-
times also by public funding institutions) on the one hand, and the current
dominant themes in research areas on the other. Advertising ethics and critique
is, despite of its growing relevance from a social point of view, not “en vogue” –
30
Kati Förster and Ulrike Weish

neither in practice nor in research. It is at best a subtheme, an imposition, as it
does not help to position the research in a competitive environment. In their
seminal article, Drumwright and Murphy (2009) investigated the current state
of advertising ethics. They interviewed industry and academic leaders, analyzed
agency websites, advertising textbooks and academic literature. As one of their
main ﬁndings they conclude: “Despite attention to issues of advertising ethics
through the decades, it would be a mistake to assume that advertising ethics
has received coverage commensurate with its importance. While advertising
ethics has been recognized for some time as a mainstream topic [. . .], research
is thin and inconclusive in many important areas” (2009, p. 85).
To sum up, the question is whether advertising in the digital age leads
to more information or disinformation of consumers as individuals and – at
a macro level – as members of a society. In fact, the discussion has shown
that advertising and its critique is at a crossroads in the digital age with the
challenges sketched. The voices within this ﬁeld always have been there and
are multifaceted. The Internet has helped to make these voices louder and thus
to provide a platform to participate in any form – from staying informed via
signing petitions against certain advertising practices, to becoming an advertis-
ing activist her- or himself. This supports the assumption that digitalization
increases transparency and thus information about advertising practices. At
the same time, the possibilities to collect data and to violate privacy increase.
Furthermore, it is getting harder for self-regulatory authorities to oversee the
highly fragmented ﬁeld of digital advertising due to the sheer number of diﬀerent
websites, apps, blogs et cetera and to take action against violations of their code
of ethics. So in contrast, these aspects underline the threat of a higher disinfor-
mation through digitalization in advertising. So far, a categorical answer cannot
be given to the question, but it can be supposed that advertising critique plays a
vital role in this area of tension. Right now, the role of research on advertising
ethics seems to diminish mainly due to the speed digital advertising and its
phenomena have developed. It has to be questioned whether the traditional
forms of scientiﬁc critique are still suﬃcient or whether we need newer ways to
stay relevant as a critical intellectual voice. This becomes even more acute as
advertising needs a constructive corrective in order to prevent an imbalance
between public and economic interests, or as Pollay formulates it more strik-
ingly: “Of all the aspects of advertising that might be studied, values have the
most profound implications and are the most meaningful to the larger academic
community and the community at large” (1987, p. 107).

1.2 Information and Disinformation Through
Advertising Literacy in Communication
Studies: Action Research and Real
Social Projects
Abstract: In today’s “liquid modern world” where everything is transitory and
perishable and consumerism has become a social product in itself accelerating
the cyclic reposition of worn goods and services, nourished by a fear of drop-
ping out of “the social circulation” of esteem and human networks a growing
number of critical societal actors have started to demand a more responsible
approach for commercial communication, requiring more complete, accurate
and truthful information about brands and corporations. Consumers, consumer
organizations, communication scholars and media, among others, are willing to
become part of the co-creation of brand information and stories, moving the
focus from disinformation to information, responding to the demands for a
more responsible commercial world, aligned with the emerging concept of
responsible research and innovation (RRI). New interactive ways of advertising
and the blurring of boundaries between advertising and entertainment also con-
tribute to creating a challenging scenario for future advertising professionals
who need to re-deﬁne their way of informing and communicating not only with
consumers but all other societal stakeholders. The purpose of this article is
to explain how including advertising literacy and education in the curricula
of university level communication studies and applying innovating teaching
methodology can eﬃciently respond to at least part of these new societal de-
mands, emphasizing the “right impacts and values” of advertising by future
communicators.
1 Advertising Literacy and Youth
Since the start of the new millennium, dramatic changes in the commercial media
environment have occurred because the boundaries between advertising, enter-
tainment and information have become increasingly blurred (Balasubramanian
et al. 2006).

A growing body of research has been devoted to areas of content that are
not traditionally viewed as advertising such as sponsorships, brand content,
street marketing, product placement and other new techniques. These advertis-
ing formats often contain hidden attempts to persuade and are not immediately
recognized as advertising by the consumer (van Reijmersdal 2009).
Over the years online advertising has evolved and changed drastically from
simple advertising formats to banner ads, pop-ups and interstitials, to sophisti-
cated interactive 3D visualizations and “advergames” (Faber et al. 2004). Nowa-
days social networks are also used to improve advertising strategies. These
relatively new forms of communication are challenging the ways that we under-
stand and process advertising.
Digital advertising communication is developing new ways to engage with
audiences and is transforming the media environment. Today attention is
focused on integration not only in advertising, but in all kinds of commercial
communication, and therefore transmedia strategy is involved in new ways of
making ads and the relationship with brands.
Brands are transforming into brand utility and entertainment intended to
help people in their life journey. Traditional and intrusive ads are becoming
less common while consumers’ understanding of products, services and corpo-
rations is often perceived in terms of brand utility and entertainment, i.e. how
brands can help people cope with and enjoy their everyday lives.
This integration of advertising and entertainment has opened up an innova-
tive new way to understand advertising communication. It is generally assumed
that young people are easily persuaded by these subtle formats, which often
involve integrated advertising, because the young are thought to be less aware
of their persuasive intent. Consumers are sceptical of advertising because of the
bias of the source and the advertiser’s aim to persuade the consumer. This could
be particularly relevant for the diverse formats of the Internet, since the source
of content found on websites is more diﬃcult to evaluate compared with tradi-
tional media sources. Thus for consumers it is also more diﬃcult to identify the
source of online content and evaluate its credibility. In a nutshell, developing
Internet advertising literacy has become more challenging in today’s rapidly de-
veloping media and communication scenery, where digital advertising is chang-
ing in its format and content every day. The creation of new technologies such as
APPs, virtual worlds or augmented reality creates diﬃculties for understanding
and interpreting new forms of advertising.
Also, changes are happening because the boundaries between oﬄine and
online are disappearing. Brands today have the opportunity to research and
know more than ever about their public due to big data processing. For that
reason, they can create speciﬁc contents for more and more speciﬁc audiences,

based on precise behavioural retargeting. Audiences need to be trained for these
new types of advertising communication in order to help them gain new kinds
of advertising and media literacy.
Content which is strategically planned by companies and interacts with
the public through their own communication channels improves the eﬀect of
advertising, because it creates an engagement with the brand. Rather than using
traditional mass media, brands nowadays often use their own channels where
they can better control the message and language, interact with consumers,
and better target the public.
It is generally assumed that integrated formats are more eﬀective in evoking
some persuasive outcomes, such as product attitudes, than non-integrated
formats (Balasubramanian et al. 2006). The most important theoretical explana-
tion for this assumption is that people are expected to be more critical toward
advertising than toward editorial content (van Reijmersdal et al. 2015). This is
where the question of the ethical implications of information and disinformation
arises, as persuasive and commercial communication uses the means and styles
of journalistic and informative communication that can easily confuse, espe-
cially the young public. If content is seen as editorial the consumers’ critical
observation becomes more relaxed.
Up to now there has been a lack of integration between persuasion knowl-
edge and advertising literacy studies and research on advertising eﬀects, but
recent studies tend to consider both aspects. In a review of research on
children’s advertising literacy, Rozendaal, Lapierre, et al. (2011) observed that
existing conceptualizations of advertising literacy primarily entail conceptual
knowledge of advertising (i.e. the ability to recognize and understand advertis-
ing messages). However, based on insights from persuasion processing theories
they argued that because most contemporary advertising appeals to children on
an aﬀective level, children are expected to primarily process advertising under
conditions of low elaboration. Consequently, young people are unlikely to use
their conceptual knowledge of advertising to critically evaluate the advertise-
ments they are confronted with.
Based on this line of reasoning, Rozendaal, Lapierre, et al. (2011) stressed
the need to extend the prevailing one-dimensional conceptualization of adver-
tising literacy (i.e. conceptual knowledge of advertising, which is referred to as
conceptual advertising literacy) with two extra dimensions: attitudinal advertising
literacy, which includes low-eﬀort, attitudinal mechanisms that can function as a
defence under conditions of low elaboration, and advertising literacy performance,
which takes into account the actual use of conceptual advertising knowledge
when confronted with advertising.
Action Research and Real Social Projects
39

The ﬁrst dimension, conceptual advertising literacy, is the ability to recognize
and understand advertising messages. This ability concerns the selling proposal
of the ads, understanding who pays the advertising, understanding the targeting
and persuasive intent. Persuasion knowledge, which is also often referred to as
“advertising literacy” in the literature on children and advertising (Livingstone,
Helsper 2006), can be deﬁned as concerning the consumers’ beliefs about the
motives, strategies, and tactics of advertising. The second dimension, attitudinal
advertising literacy, involves taking a critical attitude toward advertising based
on scepticism and a dislike of advertising.
Finally, the third dimension, advertising literacy performance, is the ability
to actually use the conceptual advertising knowledge when confronted with the
advertising (Rozendaal et al. 2009). This takes into account the actual use of
conceptual knowledge of advertising while being exposed to it, and the retriev-
ing and applying of advertising knowledge.
Most traditional studies have concentrated on two components: recognition
of advertising and understanding of its selling intent (Kunkel 2010). Even if we
grant that the young have the necessary conceptual knowledge of advertising in
place, it does not necessarily follow that they will actually enact it as a critical
defence against its persuasive appeal (Moses, Baldwin 2005). In this case, they
are more vulnerable when encountering messages in advertising that can be
considered as disinformation.
When we are talking about advertising literacy, usually we focus on children
and young people. In this paper we extend both the deﬁnition and explanation
to university level students of advertising communication. The mere fact of
knowledge of advertising communication and literacy does not imply that it
can be adequately applied. For our students it is necessary to practice the
knowledge they have acquired in order to become advertising literate. If they
have the ﬁrst dimension (conceptual literacy), but are not able to improve their
attitudinal and performance skills, they will not develop advertising literacy and
consequently become well informed.
Also, they must be trained to explore advertising and the other innovative
forms of communication in a digital world, analysing the good practises of
advertising and contributing through our profession to create a better world,
helping societies to improve and grow. Advertising literacy and education is
not just about acquiring theoretical notions and technical skills, but also about
becoming critical and responsible. In practice, we cannot separate digital literacy
and advertising literacy from media and information literacy, so in our classrooms
we try to reproduce a working context where students can contribute to and a
share their life experiences at the university, motivating them to use their
own skills and competences that they have acquired outside of university. The
40
Patricia Núñez Gomez and Liisa Irene Hänninen

current education system often neglects the self-learned competences students
have acquired outside of academia that are valuable for future advertising pro-
fessionals, such as editing, designing and music among others, skills they share
with each other, acting as teachers or mentors.
When it comes to the digital classroom we often leave students to lead a
session and direct projects related to our teaching subjects (advertising, public
relations, creativity, leadership, social communication), giving them responsibil-
ities and facing them with real work contexts. With the assistance and mentor-
ing of communications professionals students feel more assured, try to do their
best, and learn from mistakes. Also, as they use their own digital communica-
tion skills in the classroom, they become more self-conﬁdent in their private
life, and that is clearly reﬂected in their professional capacities and performance.
As future leaders in advertising they must be able to develop valid information
for a more responsible society and not resort to disinformation or misinforma-
tion in any form.
As Buckingham says (2003), media literacy refers to broad-based skills and
competencies that people must have when they try to communicate, understand
and create media texts and meanings in the modern media age. The term
“digital natives” must be extended to embrace not only technological skills but
also critical and user competences in a wider concept. These are the 21st century
skills that citizens, and communicators in particular, must have to be able to use
digital services and be responsible and critical consumers and creative content
creators.
As Professor Kupiainen underlines, students learn in informal environments
but these alone are not enough for a complete education, so if universities and
schools can bring together both worlds (formal and informal) maybe they can
learn in a more appropriate way. Using their digital skills inside the university
can help students acquire a deeper knowledge of them, for example when they
use it to collaborate in pairs, digital responsibility, etc. (Kupiainen 2013). He
talks about cultural media education, where the focus is on everyday meaning
making where people, especially children and young people, use media to
communicate in a variety of sociocultural contexts.
The starting point for media literacy is not just about cognitive or individual
skills. The basic question is: what kinds of literacies and skills are needed in the
information society? How are media literacy, digital literacy and advertising
literacy required in everyday social and cultural practices? Binkley et al. (2010),
when introducing the 21st century competences required for the current informa-
tion society mentions information and ICT literacies as tools to work with, and
our team would add information literacy. However, in this chapter we often refer
Action Research and Real Social Projects
41

to the term advertising literacy as a global concept, meaning the entire set of
literacies relating to advertising and media.
Now we cannot fully understand the above mentioned forms of literacy
other than in terms of information literacy, relating them to the concepts of
information, disinformation and misinformation. Karlova and Fisher (2013) make
a diﬀerentiation between misinformation, understood as inaccurate information,
and disinformation, seen as deliberately deceptive information. The authors con-
clude that misinformation and disinformation are closely linked to information
literacy, especially in terms of how they are diﬀused and shared and how people
use both cues to credibility and cues to deception to make judgements.” (2013,
p. 1). The authors argue that information and disinformation must be taken into
consideration in the ﬁeld of information behavior, as elements of information
literacy, because inaccuracies and deceptions “permeate much of the world’s
information” (Karlova, Fisher 2013, p. 2). Advertising and other forms of com-
mercial communication deal with information and the mere fact that their focus
is always persuasive, often openly so, does not excuse abusive, non-accurate
and incomplete uses of information, and even less so disinformation and mis-
information.
Commercial communication and specially advertising are often accused of
disinformation and even deliberate cheating when delivering brand information.
The exaggerations about brand attributes and the lack of complete and compre-
hensive information on product labels (misinformation) have caused large-scale
social criticism of advertisers and agencies, for example the recent discussions
in the ﬁeld of alimentation about the excessive amount of sugar, nitrates and
other potentially health damaging ingredients in processed food products or
about the use of terms such as “natural” when referring to food products.
Consumer organizations, media and an increasing number of consumers have
started to demand more accurate and complete information not only on products
and services, but also on the corporate brands behind the goods.
Now, the role of advertising students as “prosumers”, future professional
producers of commercial communication and at the same time consumers, opens
interesting and challenging perspectives for advertising education. Media and
information literacy, advertising literacy and digital literacy teaching can be
understood within the framework of social responsibility and sustainability de-
manded by critical societal actors, and future communicators can become front-
runners in terms of the equalling of power between consumers and advertisers.
The educational strategy that can respond to new societal demands is
aligned with the new focus in science, the concept of RRI, responsible research
and innovation, which also applies to the ﬁeld of academia. The methodology
of real social projects as a means of advertising literacy education for future
42
Patricia Núñez Gomez and Liisa Irene Hänninen

communicators, proposes some answers to these new societal challenges and
the demand for more responsible advertising campaigns in terms of fostering
better and truthful communication and co-production with society, moving from
disinformation to information in commercial communication.
2 Real Social Projects and Action Research as a
Vehicle for Advertising Literacy and Values
Education Among University Communication
Students
2.1 Background for the Methodology of Real Social Projects
and its Relation to Advertising and Information Literacy
Since 2003, a team of lecturers and researchers from the Faculty of Communica-
tion Science, Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) has been applying the
methodology of real social projects in the teaching of advertising and public
relations to undergraduate and master’s degree students, recognized by and
receiving ﬁnancial support from the Complutense Fund for Educational Innova-
tion and Quality Improvement. A project that started as a pilot experience with
a small group of students organizing a charity event for the Madrid food bank,
has developed into a shared action research and communication management
project among students, lecturers and non-proﬁt organizations, including inter-
national and non-governmental organizations (NGOS), with around 400 to 500
students that yearly beneﬁt from the methodology and with more than 100
third-sector entities as partners. As a result of more than ten years of the appli-
cation, study, innovation and improvement of the methodology of real social
projects, this teaching system has been validated as an eﬃcient vehicle not
only for teaching research and communication strategies, but also to help
students gain the kind of literacies required for professional communicators:
advertising, media, information, ICT and digital literacies.
The method of real social projects, developed within the framework of inter-
active learning systems, consists of the planning and implementing of real
research and communication projects for a non-proﬁt organization. Experience
is acquired in a professional context and thus the project is largely based on the
experiential learning theory and cyclic learning processes originally developed by
Dewey (1997 [1938]) and further by Kolb (2014 [1984]). Students become the main
actors of their learning process and learn to take responsibilities working with
Action Research and Real Social Projects
43

the NGOS, whereas lecturers act as mentors and coaches to the group. The
methodology is based on collaborative learning, a teaching approach that was
consolidated in higher education in the late 1990s (Bruﬀee 1999; Cabrera et al.
2002) and is today used in study communities. Within the project a collaborative
focus means including three actors that create a multidirectional working
network: students, lecturers and non-proﬁt organizations. Students assume the
role of an advertising or PR agency, lecturers act as account supervisors and
NGOs actually become real clients and demand services from the student teams.
Teaching and investigating advertising literacy (and related literacies)
among young people is a challenging issue in itself, but exploring and working
on the concept with advertising students opens new perspectives, as here
the youth, that would be subject of study in a traditional research focus, will
become investigators and designers of the campaigns in their professional future
and thus, have a larger knowledge of commercial communication strategies,
intentions and symbols than young people in general. Their double role as con-
sumers and would-be professional communicators gives them a deeper under-
standing of the commercial world. But does it always necessarily make them
more responsible than other young people? The answer is no, not if we only
concentrate on educating students in conceptual advertising literacy and forget
the attitudinal and performance levels.
Today’s “liquid modern world” as Bauman (2010) deﬁnes the postmodern
era, is a society where everything is transitory and perishable, where con-
sumerism has become a social product consisting of the cyclic reposition of
worn articles, which gains meaning because citizens are afraid of losing market
value if not consuming and fear being left out of “the social circulation” of
esteem and networks of friends, aspects that deﬁne us as members of the group.
In advertising, more than in many other ﬁelds of communication, the game is
about generating feelings of belonging, creating shared brand universes and
building consumer ﬁdelity.
Advertising students follow trends and are aware of new tendencies in the
commercial world, not just because they are interested in fashion and trendy
topics, but also because their studies demand it. And no doubt they use “cool
brands” as other students do in order to underline that they are diﬀerent, to
integrate into a desired youth environment and group. Belonging to and being
inside the right kind of social circles can be as important to communication stu-
dents as it is to mathematics students, but still, understanding the mechanisms
of persuasion and the underlying social and psychological aspects is bound to
give them more tools to be critical with respect to advertising and other com-
mercial messages.

The age of innocence of interpreting openly persuasive forms of advertising
as objective information is long gone, but in the ﬁeld of publicity for instance,
the distinction between information and disinformation is often tricky, because
it relies on inﬂuence and persuasion, and also uses an informative appearance
that can easily be mistaken for journalistic content. Publicity uses critical and
civilizing messages, with underlying persuasive signiﬁcations, but these are
often camouﬂaged, simulated or dissimulated (Craig 2014, p. 20). To defend
themselves, students must know what it is all about. To use this kind of
communication in the future, communication students must learn the ethical
implications of information. What Twitterers, Instagramers, YouTubers and other
social media inﬂuencers say is happily shared by most of us, as long as it is new
and surprising. But how often do we, young or old, consider whether we are
spreading information, misinformation or even disinformation? Do we really con-
sider the objectiveness and truth of the messages we forward and comment on?
The rapid changes in today’s communication scenery set new demands for
literacy education and require new deﬁnitions for information, misinformation
and disinformation in the commercial world. Generally seen as to the opposite
of misinformation and disinformation, information is often associated with the
notion of “truth”. For example, De George (2003) makes a distinction between
data and information because data contains no claims to truth whereas informa-
tion does.
Stahl (2006, p. 90) argues that for a critical researcher truth can never be
an objective description of external reality and that all perception is always
value-laden and based on prejudices. In the author’s interpretation of informa-
tion, misinformation and disinformation, Stahl describes the concepts from the
perspective of two of the most widely cited authors in CRIS (Critical Research
in Information Systems), Habermas and Foucault. From a Habermasian focus,
misinformation is not problematic, it is seen simply as information that is
contentious and that will for this reason be analysed in a discourse, where
the person claiming truth will need to explain his reasons. Disinformation is
more problematic, as it is seen as information that deliberately alienates or
disempowers people. For a Foucauldian, distinguishing misinformation and
disinformation is artiﬁcial as it supposes there is a universal truth and that the
speaker has self-reﬂectiveness in terms of her own intentions when speaking
(Stahl 2006, p. 91). It is the alienating and disempowering risk of deceptive
informing, mentioned by Habermas, that seems particularly relevant for the
advertising education project described in the present chapter, especially when
collaborating with third-sector organizations, where building trust is a core
concept when dealing with the public and beneﬁciaries of social and coopera-
tive projects. Students need to learn the limits of information, as well as the
dangers of mis- and disinformation.
Action Research and Real Social Projects
45

The protective and preventive role of advertising literacy education in terms
of responsible advertiser and consumer behavior is implicitly present in many of
the subjects taught at communication schools (such as professional deontology
and ethics or consumerism), but the focus changes when it comes to non-proﬁt
advertising teaching. The real social projects team emphasizes the role of adver-
tising literacy among communication students not so much as a means of
protection against the persuasive tricks of advertisers but more as education in
values and social responsibility towards all the important stakeholders of the
marketplace: consumers, clients, media, consumer associations, environmental
organizations, coworkers in the advertising agency, etc. This also implies facili-
tating a broad understanding of information literacy to the students, in terms of
information, disinformation and misinformation. In our experience, collaborat-
ing with non-proﬁt organizations facilitates an adequate environment for acquir-
ing these multiple types of literacy related to advertising focused on values in
today’s complex and highly competitive commercial ecosystem.
2.2 Action Research in Communication Education:
Realistic Feedback for a Growth Mindset
Over the years of applying the methodology of real social projects, the team has
tested and used diverse research techniques, but it is action research that best
adjusts to the speciﬁc environment of the project that combines two levels of
study: 1. applied research for non-proﬁt organizations and 2. teaching methodology
research and quality improvement, focusing on real social projects and advertising
literacy. Action research, as pointed out by Stringer (2014), provides a means to
ﬁnd eﬀective solutions to problems in localized settings and thus helps organi-
zations increase the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of their work:
“Far from providing a set of ﬁxed prescriptions to be applied in any context, action
research provides a ﬂexible and practical set of procedures that are systematic, cyclical,
solution oriented and participatory, providing the means to devise sustainable improve-
ments in practice that enhance the lives and well-being of all participants.” (2014, p. 5)
The research is required to produce improvements and action that can make
practical changes to the lives of the persons involved, rather than merely generate
neat reports which are ﬁled away and then forgotten. Non-proﬁt organizations,
especially small ones, that often lack qualiﬁed communication departments
due to scarce resources, beneﬁt from the studies provided by the student team
collaborating with them and this has repercussions for the professionalization
of their workforce. Also, as scholars, students and NGO workers together study
46
Patricia Núñez Gomez and Liisa Irene Hänninen

examples of good and bad campaigns, this can be viewed as “in-company
advertising literacy coaching” contributing to the learning of good practice,
often necessary for small organizations that cannot hire communication profes-
sionals or agencies.
At the non-proﬁt level, using action research techniques and collaborative
working systems where students, lecturers and NGO communication oﬃcers,
and sometimes even the beneﬁciaries of the social project, act hand in hand
generates productive communication campaigns that can have a direct impact
on many underprivileged people’s lives. Ideas and input from all the collectives
participating in campaign creation are incorporated into the phases of strategic
planning using a collaborative approach to inquiry (Stringer 2014) that can
provide the team with the means to take the right kind of systematic action and
resolve speciﬁc problems. For example, in drug prevention campaigns designed
by students, part of the problem – young people consuming substances – will
become part of the solution, as students that have tried drugs know the motiva-
tions for consuming them and can thus contribute better insights to prevention
campaigns than might formal survey results.
At the communication school level this leads to better teaching practices,
augmented advertising literacy and higher motivation levels among communica-
tion students. Also, students gain self-esteem when confronted with the real
professional world, when they realize that they are actually able to handle tricky
communication strategies, not just ﬁctitious class assignment. The feedback is
more realistic, criticism is more constructive and students receive praise in its
just measure. Dweck’s work on mindsets and how they can contribute to people’s
success (2006), as well as his paper on the perils and promises of praise (2007),
alerts us to the risks of excessive appraisal. Dweck ﬁnds (as cited in Leather 2013)
that praising intelligence or abilities gives a “ﬁxed mindset” that, when presented
with a challenge, causes withdrawal from the task, lowering motivation and
sense of self; whereas helping people to develop their “growth mindset” generates
motivation and an enhanced sense of self as well as resilience.
Our lecturing team has realized that constructive criticism and measured
positive comments and coaching practices when working in real projects, seem
to help students in their professional development and personal growth. Over
90% of the participating students over the past decade whose opinions are
collected and analyzed every end of semester, have expressed their positive
opinion of the teaching methodology and declared that they feel more conﬁdent
and prepared to face the challenges of their future work posts.
As a whole the project is about developing advertising literacy and educa-
tion praxis for social change, sharing the educational philosophy and action
lines of Vallaeys (2003), Soares (2011) and Custódio (2015), among others.
Action Research and Real Social Projects

2.3 Working Procedures and Practical Experiences:
Usually, every beginning of term when the team starts to work in the project, the
ﬁrst step is to explore the market and issue in question as a prior step to design-
ing communication strategies and campaigns for the non-proﬁt organizations
that students collaborate with. In parallel to students’ research actions, the
lecturing team begins to analyze the educational and motivational value of the
global project: they use participant and classroom observation to monitor and
create an adequate work climate, list and measure learning expectations using
surveys and class discussions, as well as explore the values involved in third-
sector advertising and communication through case studies of campaigns. At
the end of the semester student feedback is gathered by focus groups and
surveys and changes are made to readjust the teaching methodology. Though
questionnaires are used to quantify student opinions, observational and narra-
tive action research methods such as those described by McKerman (2013) and
seen above are used by the real social projects team, permitting a deeper look
into any problems and progress and enabling adjustments to practice.
To visualize the working procedures, we will describe the yearly Africa
Conference that journalism students organized during two academic courses as
their public relations class assignment. One half of the students were assigned
organizational issues of the conference, whereas the other half dealt with diverse
issues of African reality and delivered their ﬁndings in conference papers and
posters. The students working on these specialized reports used diverse research
techniques, such as media content analysis, expert interviews, literature review
and surveys to explore issues such as human traﬃcking, diamond wars, child
soldiers, refugees, the African press, gender roles, hunting, nature preservation,
music, etc. Some of the students applied the research outcomes to design
campaigns for NGOs. In these kinds of working environments that deal with
sensitive social and developmental issues, students gain information, reducing
dis- and misinformation, and acquire a critical point of view on topics that are
not mainstream in traditional media or formal university curricula.
As for the organizational aspect, taking as an example the conference
management team, the students did market research by analyzing competing
conferences by type, persons, entities and the press that work in issues related
with the continent, then contacted and interviewed journalists, writers and
experts on African society as well as African youth, to get involved and become
speakers or sponsors at the conference. These continuing cycles of investigation
permitted the team to get a glimpse of the complexity of African realities and
also helped them to create visibility for the continent within the academic com-
munity. In classroom sessions during the planning period of the conference, aid
48
Patricia Núñez Gomez and Liisa Irene Hänninen

organizations and NGO campaigns were studied in order to foster advertising
literacy within the charities and aid organizations with the aim of outlining the
diﬀerences in values that they represent, and this way students learn that they
cannot use the same strategies, coding system, images and messages as in
traditional corporate and product advertising and communication.
For example, regarding a campaign proposal for Food Bank, students were
asked why a commercial cannot show a beggar scavenging through a street
dustbin even if it is legal and seems like a striking idea for an ad? On the one
hand, it goes against ethics, as most homeless people do not want to be shown
in that kind of situation. On the other hand, generating the association between
trash bins and Food Bank might make people suspicious of the origin of the
foodstuﬀs the NGO delivers. At the communication school, an important part of
advertising literacy teaching when applied to the third sector, deals with moral
restrictions and rules that go beyond the legal and written ethics statements,
and action research helps students to discover the underlying reasons. As
McNiﬀand Whitehead (2011) state: “action research is value laden and morally
committed” (2011, p. 27), and when applied to charities it is even more so.
Another eﬃcient way of learning advertising literacy within the class project
was the designing of communication strategies for NGOS, a task that some
teams completed and presented during the conference having previously attended
brieﬁngs and brainstorming sessions with the communication department execu-
tives of the organization. This way of teaching works through in-company (or
in-NGO) learning where the organization’s communication manager becomes a
tutor by showing students previous and competing campaigns and analyzing
benchmarking adds and communication actions, so that the trainees can design
new strategies and action plans for the organization. Critical analysis of not only
ads, but also media information of issues related to the NGO’s cause is also
included, where students learn to distinguish between information, disinforma-
tion and misinformation. Learning and research become action, but with more
knowledge and with respect for diﬀerent realities and vulnerable beneﬁciaries.
2.4 “Learning by Doing” and “Co-creation” as Strategies for
Action Research and Advertising Literacy Learning
The strategy of learning by doing (DuFour et al. 2006) and experiential learn-
ing (Kolb 2014 [1984]) have proved their eﬃciency in the application of the
methodology of real social projects where students must assume responsibility
for entire communication campaigns and research projects that will have public
exposure through the mass media and measurable impacts on key audiences, in
Action Research and Real Social Projects
49

addition to any positive repercussions on the realities and life conditions of
many underprivileged people in the case that the campaign succeeds.
In many of the advertising campaigns designed by students targeting young
consumers or the public, the gap between industry and the public becomes so
narrow that we can talk about co-creation (Prahalad, Ramaswamy 2004; Hatch,
Schultz 2010). A tendency especially visible in social media is guerilla marketing
and the organization of events, where the consumers or users take an active part
in the communication. However, in social media where nearly everyone has
the potential of becoming an author, the risk of false information arises. Among
others, Popava (2015) and Keshavarz (2014) alert us to questions of reliability
and credibility on the web; information versus dis- and misinformation. Hence
our team has included information literacy as part of the advertising education
project.
In communication education, both reception and creation competences should
be developed to gain media and advertising literacy (Díaz-Aguado Jalón et al.
2015, p. 226), especially when teaching takes place at the school of communica-
tion. With a combined focus, young people can reach a deep understanding of
how persuasive communication works and develop a capacity for critical recep-
tion as well as learn about ethical and eﬃcient ways to design communication
strategies as future advertising and PR professionals. The experience our team
has acquired collaborating in drug prevention campaigns with Atenea Founda-
tion and the Madrid Community Drug Prevention Plan, described in this chapter,
illustrates the double role of media, information and advertising education
where students are seen both as a target public and as creators of a campaign.
Co-creation is often used by our team, especially when the campaign targets
young people, as this way students study the young audience from the inside and
gain quick insights through the use of participative action research methodology.
As a ﬁrst phase for the drug prevention campaigns, students received an
intensive course on drugs and the physical, psychological and social implica-
tions of consumption. The second phase was dedicated to peer research, where
students interviewed and ﬁlmed anonymous student statements for and against
drug use. Students were encouraged to share the information they had acquired
during the course, but instead of using the “authority, parent, big brother tell-
ing” strategy, it was an example of peer education, using the informal discourse
of young people. After the preparation process, students had acquired the
necessary level of knowledge concerning drugs and prevention, but they still
needed to learn more about prevention campaigns, motivations and the values
they involve.
This is why an advertising literacy module was included as part of the
project, where students took part in campaign case studies from the point of
50

view of both reception and creation. First, students learned about the mecha-
nisms that get young people addicted and how communication can contribute to
informing and dissuading drug use by analyzing ads and social media messages
and discerning the creative strategies behind the campaigns. Messages, language
and image codes, type of storytelling, social representations and the tone of
narrative, among others, were analyzed by students and understood not only
from a theoretical perspective, but also on a personal level as part of the target
audience for the campaigns. Having received a course in drugs and prevention,
students were able to detect cases of disinformation in the communication
materials they analyzed and demonstrated that they had gained information
literacy. It was only after this learning phase that students could begin to them-
selves create, and take part in a contest designing campaigns based on the
knowledge acquired in the workshops.
2.5 The Teaching of 21st Century Skills and Advertising
Literacy
The need for new knowledge and general competences required for the 21st
century information or knowledge society have been identiﬁed and largely dis-
cussed by scholars (Plomp 2013; e.g. Binkley et al. 2010). The Assessment &
Teaching of 21st Century Skills Project (see http.//atc21s.org) deﬁnes the educa-
tional aims relating to the competences employers’ demand of entry-level workers
in today’s information-age society and that should be included in today’s school
curricula. These skills, many of which our college level students still lack, are
grouped under the acronym KSAVE, meaning knowledge, skills, attitudes, values
and ethics. The project identiﬁes ten skills organized in four broad categories
(Binkley et al. 2010). The ATC21S has been used as a starting point for improving
our educational innovation and advertising literacy projects at the Faculty of
Communication to assist in adjustment to future workplace requirements. The
following adaptation of the model (Binkley et al. 2010) shows how these
can be integrated into university level communication and advertising literacy
education, using real social projects and action research as a basis for the
methodology.
Ways of Thinking:
1.
Creativity and innovation
2.
Critical thinking, problem-solving, decision-making
3.
Learning to learn/metacognition (knowledge about cognitive processes)
Action Research and Real Social Projects
51

Working on advertising campaigns fosters a student’s ability to create and inno-
vate and has all the challenges of a real work context with the requirements and
deadlines of any work assignment. Working with real professional projects, not
just simulations, forces students to make decisions, solve problems and learn to
be critical in terms of research plans, strategies and creative pieces. Learning by
doing a real campaign gives them a better insight into the creative process than
simulated class assignments.
Tools for Working:
4.
Information literacy
5.
Information and communication technology (ICT) literacy
Training future advertising and communication professionals requires including
information and ITC in the methodology as well as media and advertising literacy
education systems and toward this aim analyzing and working with a real
campaign oﬀers an adequate platform. The team emphasizes the importance of
information literacy and a broad understanding of information and disinforma-
tion, including it in the project curricula. Social networks, shared online work-
places and the virtual campus are largely used in the projects, but this is a ﬁeld
where improvement by our team is required. Cross disciplinary collaboration
with the Faculty of Information Science is planned so as to foster more advanced
practices.
Ways of Working:
6.
Communication
7.
Collaboration (teamwork)
Internal and external communication networks are part of the learning system
used in the real projects methodology, which is collaborative by nature and
depends on eﬀective teamwork, as in communication agencies and departments.
More than in other ﬁelds of knowledge, in communication aspects related to
sharing, cooperating and collaborating are of vital importance, otherwise we
could not even use the term communicate (from latin communicare, to share, to
put in common).
Ways of Living in the World:
8.
Citizenship (local and global)
9.
Life and career
10. Personal and social responsibility (including cultural awareness and com-
petence)
52
Patricia Núñez Gomez and Liisa Irene Hänninen

“Glocal”, meaning local applications for global ideas and innovations is key to
understanding today’s business and communication. Students work in non-
proﬁt projects that beneﬁt underprivileged people, sometimes local, other times
on other continents, and in order to do their work well, they need to learn to
build bridges towards intercultural understanding and global citizenship. Ours
and theirs, fear of “otherness” are not terms admitted within the work teams.
Working for free for the beneﬁt of other people educates students in values and
responsibility, both in personal and corporate contexts. Forming teams with
students form diﬀerent cultural backgrounds raises global awareness and fosters
cross-cultural skills. An example of this is a student team recently formed to
collaborate on a fundraising campaign for an NGO in Ghana, where the team
leader role is assumed by Chinese master’s degree students and the work team
formed by local (Spanish), Belgian and German Erasmus students, coordinated
by African volunteer workers, and ﬁnally mentored and coached by local and
Finnish lecturers.
2.6 Conclusions
In this chapter, we have shared a working methodology and some practical ex-
periences for the teaching of “advertising related literacies” to communication
school students. As ICT and communications tools and strategies are in a state
of constant change, advertising education is becoming increasingly challenging.
Not only are eﬃciency and impact required by advertising, but there is also a
demand for the “right impact”, for a more responsible, credible, accurate and
truthful communication with the various stakeholders with regard to the new
discipline of RRI – responsible research and innovation.
In our experience, the key idea that can give some response to today’s
ethical demands in the ﬁeld of education in commercial communication can be
found in the distinction between information, disinformation and misinforma-
tion. Beyond the philosophical discussions about “truth”, scholars mostly agree
that disinformation implicitly includes the deliberate intention to give false
intention, whereas misinformation is wrong, misleading or incomplete informa-
tion, without the necessary intention of misleading the public. However diﬃcult
it is to ﬁnd a valid deﬁnition for objectivity in communication, it is up to the
team making decisions on publishing or advertising a brand to determine the
degree of truth or falsity of the information included, something that advertising
students must learn at an early stage of their education. Within the scope of our
project, building trust is key to gaining stakeholders when it comes to NGO com-
munication strategies based on truthful storytelling.
Action Research and Real Social Projects
53

In our experience, action research, a socially responsible method by deﬁni-
tion, and real social projects can work eﬃciently as a means of promoting adver-
tising literacy, but a broader understanding of the concept in required and
media, ICT, digital, information and some new, yet to be named near future
literacies must be englobed in the project.
New media and new contents created in diﬀerent formats where similarities
between pure information, persuasive communication and entertainment become
blurred can confuse the message and disinformation and misinformation can be
easily taken as accurate information by students if they do not acquire up
to date advertising related literacy. At the same time, they need to learn how
to handle the user generated content they create in a proper way and how to
manage citizen authorship when working for a brand in their professional
future. In societally oriented communication, the rights of the vulnerable public
must be guaranteed and the accuracy of information is the key to a more egali-
tarian society. Media and advertising students will be the future leaders in creat-
ing advertising content, information that has the potential to either foster or
reduce social stereotypes and create trending topics and tendencies.
So advertising literacy is not only about being critical with the media and
messages, but it is also about being informed as to how to use information and
commercial communication, to understand the consequences or the social eﬀects
that it can produce. The co-creation of new media and the masses of information
generated every day requires well prepared professionals and well informed
citizens. The university must be able to form responsible workers, communica-
tors for a better future, well informed and capable of generating social change.
Only in this way can we move from disinformation to information in future of
advertising.

1.3 Advertising Self-Reference –
as Exempliﬁed by the International
Festival of Creativity
Abstract: With the beginning of the use of the Internet for commercial communi-
cation, a new era in advertising was born. Today, advertising professionals
increasingly orient themselves toward a service-dominant logic approach when
producing information for advertising purposes. Thus advertising is developing
into a postmodern marketing communication which attempts to distance itself
from the persuasiveness of advertising. In this contribution, the reasons for this
development are analyzed, using the theoretical concept of self-reference and
the idea of advertising as a social system. The empirical background is the Inter-
national Festival of Creativity (“Cannes Lions”). The analysis shows that the
central features of postmodern marketing communication, hyperreality and
second-order information, do not lead to a dissolution of advertising logic and
thus do not lead to the desired de-diﬀerentiation between people’s everyday
life and advertising.
1 Advertising and Self-Reference
In recent years, the signiﬁcant role of self-reference in terms of reﬂexivity in
explaining the source and functioning of communication has been impressively
elaborated in the communication sciences (Archer 2010; Schmidt 2008; Steier
1995). To summarize these ideas, reﬂexivity can be understood as the funda-
mental process in generating social structures. This process is realized as
communication. Communication relies on collective knowledge which builds a
bridge between human cognitive autonomy and the co-existing need for social
orientation. According to Schmidt (2008), in the domain of knowledge this
collective knowledge can be conceived of as reﬂexive loops of expectations
which are expected, and in the domain of motives and intentions as imputations
which are imputed. Collective knowledge is more or less shared by all the
members of a society and plays a fundamental role in their day-to-day com-
munications and in coordinating their behavior.
Using a system-theoretical approach advertising can be conceptualized as
a social system. As such it follows its own speciﬁc logic which is anchored in

constructed, collective knowledge of the advertising system. This knowledge is
shared by the actors within the system and gives sense and orientation to those
actors’ communications and actions (Schmidt 1990; Tropp 2014). Central to this
conception is the knowledge that in advertising, the focus is on paid creativity
which serves in an attention-grabbing manner consumers’ experiences, expecta-
tions, interests, motives, wishes, feelings, needs, etc. for the beneﬁt of the object
of the marketing (product, service, person, party, etc.).
Within the social system of advertising, four areas of action can be dis-
tinguished:
–
Production: fabrication of content and design, and creation of the advertising
materials,
–
Distribution: media planning and media purchasing,
–
Reception of the advertising materials,
–
Processing: self-presentation of the system (Figure 1).

Jörg Tropp

In these areas of action, diﬀerent organizations are active at the meso-level; but
at the micro-level, individuals are also engaged in the areas of production and
reception. The latter is due to two reasons:
First, the activities of consumers and customers can nowadays be conﬁrmed
in the action area of production (see the chapter on the rhetoric of marketing
co-creation in this volume), as is discussed under the headings of social media,
consumer-to-consumer (C2C), reverse marketing or consumer-generated adver-
tising (CGA).
Second, the action area of reception similarly demonstrates the following
peculiarity: it is possible to encounter activities which are integrated within
organizations and those which are not. In business-to-consumer (B2C) and C2C
relationships, there are no professionalized and institutionalized recipient roles
integrated into organizations. Here, the object of discourse is merely the con-
sumer. In business-to-business (B2B) relationships, the situation is diﬀerent. Here,
the role of consumer/customer is fulﬁlled by organizations in the economic system.
In the context of this paper, the action area of processing should be stressed.
Although reﬂexivity is the basis of every communication process in the advertis-
ing system, in the area of processing, there is the additional aspect of the system’s
own self-presentation; this comes in the form of professionalized communication
about advertising. This communicative processing and utilization of advertising
can be understood as institutionalized reﬂexivity within the social system of
advertising. Among other points it should be noted that:
–
Market research institutes are engaged in assessing the eﬀects of advertising
processes on behalf of agencies and/or marketing companies and in so
doing provide the agencies and their customers with leads for adjusting
their future communication.
–
Associations bring together and represent the speciﬁc interests of diﬀerent
organizations within the industry, both within the advertising system and
externally.
–
Media auditors advise marketing companies in their selection of media
agencies and evaluate and monitor the media strategies and plans provided
by the media agencies as well as the conditions for purchasing advertising
space and time.
–
In creativity competitions, advertising works entered by agencies are evaluated
and the results are brought together with the aim of compiling an annual
ranking of the most creative agencies. Worldwide, the annual International
Festival of Creativity attracts the most attention among creativity com-
petitions. Using this event as an example, the following sections will be
concerned with discussing self-reference in the advertising system.
Advertising Self-Reference

2 The International Festival of Creativity
In 2013, the best-known creativity competition worldwide, the International Festival
of Creativity in Cannes, France, celebrated its 60th anniversary. In the last ten
years, the number of entries in this festival has risen signiﬁcantly, and in 2015
reached a new peak of over 40,000. This represents an increase of around 130
per cent since 2002, a fact which impressively substantiates the increased
importance of professionalized self-reference in the form of self-presentation
within the advertising system (Figure 2).
The enormous dynamism and increase in marketing messages within the
advertising system, which are largely due to developments in communications
technology, go hand in hand with new advertising conditions for the agencies.
Consequently, advertising agencies work on their positioning in the chang-
ing market and therefore a growing importance for advertising agencies’ self-
presentation and a further increase in the number of entries can be expected.
For the festival organizers, this brings with it further growth in revenue, thanks
partly to the entry fees.
Not only the number of entries but the number of prize categories is also
steadily increasing. Whereas in 1997, agencies could enter their work in just two
categories (Film Lions, Press & Outdoor Lions), in 2015 there were 21 of them,
ranging from classics such as Film, Press & Outdoor through Product Design,
Media, and Mobile to Creative Data, Innovation, and Glass which is the newly
launched category for gender issues.
This trend towards an increase in the number of specialized domains of
self-reference can be attributed to diﬀerentiation within advertising, creating a
Figure 2: Trends in the number of entries in the International Festival of Creativity (Lions Festivals
Limited 2002–2015)

Jörg Tropp

variety of specialized solutions for diﬀerent media and multiple types of commu-
nication disciplines. Attempts on the part of the organizers to limit the number
of categories so as to reduce the number of narrowly specialized categories,
which tend to devalue the individual prizes, have been unsuccessful up till
now. On the contrary, in 2016 a number of new categories will be introduced
(Digital Craft Lions, Entertainment Lions for Music). To put it comprehensively
and across categories the aim today is, above all, to create possibilities for
communication that:
are relevant and useful for recipients (e.g.
Nike: Nike+ Fuelband; Grand Prix in the
categories Cyber and Titanium 2012),
QR-Code 1: Case Video Nike Fuel Band,
company: Nike+, agency: R/GA, New York
(R/GA 2012)
use today’s spectrum of possibilities in media
systems in modern societies in the domains
of paid, owned and earned media in ways
which are creative and cross-linked (e.g.
Metro Trains: Dumb ways to Die, Grand Prix in
the categories PR, Direct, Radio, Film and
Integrated 2013),
QR-Code 2: Case Video Dumb ways to Die,
company: Metro Trains, agency: McCann,
Melbourne (McCann Melbourne 2013)
involve recipients actively in communication
processes (e.g. Google: Hilltop Re-Imagined
for Coca Cola; Grand Prix in the category
Mobile 2012)
QR-Code 3: Case Video Hilltop Re-Imagined
for Coca-Cola, company: Google, agency:
Grow Interactive, Norfolk (Grow Interative
2012)
link marketing communications with distribu-
tion, product or service policy aspects (e.g.
Tesco: Homeplus Subway Virtual Store; Grand
Prix in the category Media 2011).
QR-Code 4: Case Video Homeplus Subway
Virtual Stores, Unternehmen: Tesco, agency:
Cheil Worldwide, Seoul (Cheil Worldwide

Advertising Self-Reference
61

Consistent with this opening up of the focus on the advertising phenomenon, in
2011 the Festival was renamed from the “International Festival of Advertising” to
the “International Festival of Creativity”. To summarize: the focus is not simply
on traditional advertising; but rather on increasingly specialized and simultane-
ously cross-linked, creative media communications and business solutions.
3 The Eﬀectiveness of Advertising Self-Reference
The success of the Cannes festival can be explained by the nature of advertising.
The event is the perfect showplace for the logic of advertising. The industry
admires itself in a glamorous mirror in which it observes how versatilely its
logical coherence of creativity, illusoriness and business can be interpreted and
simultaneously how marvelously functional it is. Advertising communication
does not have the presentation of believable, factual information as its focus;
rather it is damned to catch the attention of consumers with communications
which are not intended to represent reality but which are branded with the
motive of persuasion – from pizza packaging to a TV spot, from Web banner to
advert, from a blogger‘s recommendation to a YouTube viral. Everyone knows
this – and the industry knows that everyone knows. It is the core ﬁnding
of Friestad and Wright’s research on persuasion knowledge that there are no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between lay and expert beliefs about the psychology of
persuasion within the context of advertising (Friestad & Wright 1995).
With reference to Luhmann (1996), the thesis can therefore be advanced that
the success of the International Festival of Creativity is due to the organized
way in which it provides an experience of advertising self-reference in such a
way that the event reﬂects the true nature of advertising: it communicates in a
manner that is removed from reality and assumes that this will be assumed.
However, let us not be deceived by the apparently obvious explanation for
why the Cannes festival is so successful. This is as follows:
As with other creativity prizes, the awards – gold, silver and bronze lions –
serve to provide the basis for compiling a creativity ranking in which agencies
are sorted according to their degree of creativity. To do this, agency competitions
with a high weighting are preferentially considered. The International Festival of
Creativity carries a weighting of 8 – the highest – and thus enjoys a correspond-
ingly high prominence amongst agencies and the specialist media. The better an
agency does in the rankings the more attractive it is – on the one hand, as an
employer specializing in the area of creativity. On the other hand, with a good
62
Jörg Tropp

placing in the rankings an agency can position itself as a creative service pro-
vider among marketing companies in an increasingly tough and more competi-
tive world – or so one might think. This is all the more so if the rankings receive
strong media attention in the specialist press every year. For this reason it is not
surprising that 88% of the member agencies of the German Association of
Communication Agencies (Gesamtverband Kommunikationsagenturen GWA) re-
ported in the spring monitor 2005 that they participate in creative competitions
(Gesamtverband Kommunikationsagenturen 2005).
This explanation appears self-evident, but does not approach the crux of
the matter. Thus, Jean-Remy von Matt, co-founder and owner of the agency
Jung von Matt, which achieved ﬁrst place in the creative rankings of the two
German specialist journals Horizont and W&V Werben und Verkaufen in 2014,
claims that such rankings “. . . (are) in no way reliable indicators of the creative
potential of an agency. In my career I have met so many creative individuals
and agencies which carried oﬀprizes at creativity competitions but in the hard
day-to-day world of genuine challenges were hardly able to get anything oﬀthe
ground. A bias in competitions is also the fact that ranking placements depend
on the agency’s willingness to make investments. Further, award-winning works
are often actually individual initiatives. Anyone who is unwilling or unable
to make such investments will never reach the top” (von Matt 2011, p. 34).
Matt is not the only one with this opinion. Similarly, Alexander Schill, the
creative head of the agency Serviceplan, which in 2012 was the most successful
German agency in Cannes and in the two above-named rankings achieved
second places, does not have a problem with the agencies’ procedures for
developing ideas with the sole intention to win prizes at creative competitions.
Accordingly, these are pieces of work that are created on the initiative of an
agency without being commissioned by an agency customer and that have the
sole aim of achieving points in creative competitions. An example might be
“The Solar Annual Report 2011” which won the Grand Prix in the category
Design in 2012, and which was rumored to be a “golden idea” (Fuhr 2012).
Producing golden ideas and entering work in festivals is a costly endeavor
for agencies. For instance, the agency Jung von Matt was the German agency
with the most entries (192) in the Cannes Festival of 2010 (Unckrich 2010).
Assuming that each entry, depending on the category, costs between €299.00
(Radio) and €1,195.00 (Titanium & Integrated, Creative Eﬀectiveness) (Lions
Festivals Limited 2012), the agency had entry fees of around €143,00.00 – not
to mention the time and outlay needed for the production of golden ideas, travel
and overnight costs for staﬀ, out-of-pocket expenses, etc. Taking into account
the fact that nowadays an agency needs around 3,000 points to achieve ﬁrst
Advertising Self-Reference
63

place in a German ranking and the rule of thumb that 500 points cost around
€350,000 (Kolle 2012), this means that an agency has to pay around €2 million
annually for its engagement in creativity rankings – that is, if it wants to stay at
the top.
An initiative by agencies to limit participation in competitions – i.e. to limit
professionalized self-reference of the social system – on grounds of expense, as
expressed by von Matt, a kind of “creative de-escalation treaty” (von Matt, cited
in Amirkhizi 2008, p. 24), in which agencies would agree to enter only three
competitions (ADC Germany, Cannes Lions and EFFIE) failed in 2000 and again
in 2008. A further initiative by Amir Kassaei, the former spokesman of the board
of the Art Director Club in Germany, to found a “German Agency Index” was
also unsuccessful. This was intended to replace the hitherto existing creative
rankings by a listing involving ten evaluation criteria, including creativity
(Richter, Weber 2009). Following the announcement in 2012 by the agencies
Jung von Matt and Scholz & Friends, that they would in future only take part
in creative competitions every two years, the discussion on creative rankings
has once again been sparked. The aim of establishing an overarching, widely
recognized, and economically more cost-conscious ranking has however mis-
carried. The industry’s gazettes are clinging to their individual ranking procedures,
although fewer competitions have been taken into account in the individual
rankings since 2013. That agencies’ performance at the International Festival of
Creativity should be included is taken for granted – and with it, the continuing
pressure to produce golden ideas with their high expenditure. Agencies will
therefore have to continue to put up with this situation, even though their
achievements in Cannes, and therefore creative rankings, only give very mislead-
ing information concerning the creativity of the customer-commissioned work
carried out by agencies. Instead, the rankings show the willingness of agencies to
invest in an expensively bought appearance of being especially creative – which is
vastly independent of their actual commissioned work.
Of course, the agencies know that their customers, the companies, know the
truth about the ability of creative competitions to make any valid statements
about the creativity of an agency. Hence, Herbert Sollich, the marketing director
of the beer brand Veltins, for example, claims that the Cannes festival is fading
more and more into the background “because agencies’ clients have realized
that advertisers putting themselves on show tends to have little to do with their
advertising eﬃciency” (cited in Strasser et al. 2012, p. 31); and Marc Weegen, the
group manager for market communication for the National Association of the
German Cooperative Banks says in the same place that “I ﬁnd it awful to be at
events in which creative people praise themselves to the skies” (2012, p. 31).

“At the top” of what exactly do agencies want to stand by their participation
in the Cannes Festival and other such events, as Jean-Remy von Matt puts it?
The answer is, at the top of a creativity ranking which everyone knows does
not reﬂect the factual, commissioned creativity of an agency, but rather its
degree of identiﬁcation with the logic of the advertising industry. The eﬀective-
ness of advertising self-reference is here strikingly demonstrated: stand out
at all costs. That this has little to do with the day-to-day working creativity of
the agencies is not so bad – on the contrary that is how advertising works. The
evaluation criteria applied by the Cannes Festival are therefore not valid and
reliable measures of agency creativity. Its evaluation criterion is rather the
generally accepted and elaborately stage-managed ﬁction that agency creativity
is being measured. The Cannes Festival is no more real than the communica-
tions which agencies develop for their customers. The festival makes the DNA
of advertising visible for one week – and of course, in Cannes, the city with
a worldwide reputation for glitter and show. All this has its price, and the
agencies are ready to pay it. At the end of the day, they have no other choice
but to put on a good face for the show in which they themselves play the lead-
ing role and which they themselves want to sell – sometimes even in a perfectly
stage-managed advertising self-referenced persona (Figure 3).

4 Postmodern Marketing Communication
The line of argument presented here leads inevitably to the diagnosis that adver-
tising has arrived in the postmodern and has taken the evolutionary step into
postmodern marketing communication. Of course, even since the beginning of
the 1960s, with the emergence of modern trademarks and branding, a certain
lack of reality is constitutive for the reality of the advertising system. In Cannes,
however, advertising has been getting deeper into a new dimension of escapism
from reality every year; and since the 1990s this has been closely associated
with the term of postmodern marketing (e.g. Christensen et al. 2005; Firat,
Venkatesh 1993; Proctor, Kitchen 2002).
A central feature of postmodern marketing is hyperreality. This means that
signs become disconnected from their original referents and begin to create their
own reality. With reference to Baudrillard (1978), this can be formulated thus:
the advertising medium creates its own advertising product. The relationship
between the signs used in an advertising communication – the syntactic dimen-
sion – becomes disassociated from the semantic dimension – the connection
between the sign and what it signiﬁes, e.g. the advertised product. The advertis-
ing message becomes, then, self-referential, denoting nothing more than itself,
without being bound a priori to any particular product. Hence the Cannes festival
can be understood as an event which celebrates dissociation between the reality
of the creative manipulation of signs and the economically oriented sobriety of
commissioned advertising.
Hyperreality, and with it the arrival of advertising into the postmodern, can
also be seen elsewhere in Cannes. Reﬂexive expectations are causing advertising
to increasingly distance itself from its own logic of reality-distanced communica-
tion. The result is an advertising hyperreality in which the producers of advertis-
ing expect recipients and consumers to expect that advertising should be an
integral, useful part of their day-to-day lives, and not part of an unreal world
of brands and dreams. Examples from Cannes are award-winning works such
as Best Buy’s Twitter service, “Twelpforce” (Crispin et al. 2010), Tesco’s “Home-
plus Subway Virtual Store” (Cheil Worldwide 2011, see QR-Code 4), the IBM
campaign “Smart ideas for smarter cities”, which gave a service function to
out-of-home advertising materials (Ogilvy 2013), or the Beiersdorf campaign
“Nivea Protege”, where a child-protecting function was incorporated into the
print advertisement for the product Nivea Sun Kids (Foote Cone & Belding
2014). Mention should also be made of the apps for smartphones and tablets
which companies oﬀer as a free download. Bernardin and Kemp-Robertson
(2008) summarize the development as follows: the trick of the advertising sector
66
Jörg Tropp

is to move away from the public marketing of messages towards useful services:
“providing something useful, relevant, or entertaining that embeds itself much
deeper into everyday life than a 30 second commercial ever could” (Bernardin,
Kemp-Robertson 2008, p. 132).
How did it happen that advertising took the evolutionary step of mutating
into marketing communication that, against the background of the current
developments in collective advertising knowledge, can be characterized as
postmodern, and which, thanks to the future evolutionary stage of collective
knowledge about marketing communication, will become the norm for the com-
ing generation?
The answer is to be seen in the mediatization of modern society, and with
it, the establishment of a new media-matrix, the center of which is no longer
occupied by TV but by the Internet (Finnemann 2011). The players in the indi-
vidual, functionally diﬀerentiated social systems, whether they be in politics,
sport, health or, of course, also in advertising, are increasingly aligning their
actions to comply with the logic and the conditions of success required by
the media system. The result is, in essence, an exaggerated molding of all social
systems by the media system. Among advertising professionals, this develop-
ment seems to lead to the insight that target subjects not only fulﬁl a function
in the economic system as consumers, but also, with the increasing mediatiza-
tion of society, play a more and more important role in the media system as
recipients and communicators, whose expectations are to be fulﬁlled by media
oﬀerings with a marketing content.
Therefore, the central role of the Internet in the media-matrix encourages
advertising professionals to pay more attention to increasingly diverse modes
of media reception. The notion of a passive, superﬁcial mode of reception still
exists, but it seems that advertising professionals put more and more emphasis
on complex, in-depth reception by (inter)active consumers, who – according to
the dual-process models – engage with media products either peripherally and
heuristically or centrally and systematically, depending on their situational
motivation and involvement (Chaiken 1980; Petty, Cacioppo 1986). Previously,
the advertising strategies of companies and agencies were based mainly on
the former processing route. They largely worked on a goods-dominant logic
(G-D logic) informed strategy, presuming that their media products, which
communicate a consumer beneﬁt linked with the consumption or use of the
advertised product, would be processed in an often unconscious, at best super-
ﬁcial manner, and would have an impact despite the recipient’s lack of involve-
ment (Grimes, Kitchen 2007; Zajonc 1968). Those G-D logical strategies resulted
in an asymmetric communication process (Lusch, Vargo 2008) in which the con-
sumer was regarded as being an “operand resource” (Vargo, Lusch 2004, p. 7), a
Advertising Self-Reference
67

passive recipient of advertising messages that were pushed towards him (“push”
advertising). Today, however, it can be observed that advertisers are increasingly
relying on a central and systematic processing of their advertising material. For
this they develop media content based on service-dominant logic (S-D logic)
informed strategies which focus on a service that creates a beneﬁt in everyday
life, and which is largely disconnected from the consumption of the advertised
product. The advertising itself assumes a service function, by turning itself and
its media products into a beneﬁcial component of the daily-life situations and
actions of target groups. The consumer is regarded as an active “operant
resource” (2004, p. 7), as a co-producer of useful services, engaging with service
propositions oﬀered by advertisers (“pull” advertising) (regarding the S-D logic
perspective see also chapter 4.1 on the rhetoric of marketing co-creation).
Advertising professionals expect that, through this hyperrealization of adver-
tising, that is, through the dissociation of media oﬀerings from the semantics
of advertising messages, advertising will then be processed elaboratively, and
judged to be relevant and useful. Traditionally there has been a clash in the
G-D logic approach between the product beneﬁt on the one hand, and the
intrusiveness of traditional advertising (Li et al. 2002), its potential to disturb,
on the other. The idea is that this opposition will be eliminated by S-D logic-
informed advertising which aims to be a media-based service element, emerging
as a useful advertising message in the daily-life situations and actions of recipients
and no longer merely a tool for selling goods.
To summarize: the logic of the advertising system is undergoing a
mediatization-related transformation from a goods to a service-dominant logic.
This self-referential shift in collective advertising knowledge, based on the actors’
expectations and imputations of the advertising system, is today leading to the
observation that advertising, with its media oﬀerings, is distancing itself from its
previous reality, i.e. its distance from reality. Hence, it can today be charac-
terized as hyperreal and consequently as postmodern. In the words of Bogusky,
co-owner of the US-American agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky: “The consumer
should know that we know that he knows that we want to sell him something.
The divide between the advertiser and the target of the advertising has to
disappear.” (Bogusky 2008, cited in Häberle 2008, p. 21) According to this, the
hyperreal aim of postmodern marketing communication is to remove itself from
its persuasive, intrusive character – to no longer be advertising. Instead, brands
are intended to develop into useful reality marketing communicators which con-
sumers can integrate into their daily lives. In so doing, postmodern marketing
communication makes self-reference able to be experienced in the advertising
system’s action area of reception as well. Second-order information (von Foerster
1995), in the sense of advertising information about the information passed on
68
Jörg Tropp

in the advertising, is inherent in postmodern marketing communications. And
this information is: advertising no longer wants to be advertising. This however
does not change the fact that marketing communication remains advertising
to its recipients and consumers, and that marketing communications can be
logically and semantically diﬀerentiated from those of other social systems.
5 Conclusion
In the advertising industry, self-reference, as the basic process in the creation
and maintenance of social structures, has brought forth the International Festival
of Creativity which, with its diﬀerentiated domains (prize categories) makes the
self-reference of advertising in the domain of creativity clearly visible. In their
observations, in the form of judgments, the jury members make use of the logic
of that network of activity in areas that the actors in the advertising system
themselves constitute. Developments in the Festival (number and type of entries,
degree of diﬀerentiation, type of works that win prizes) allows for conclusions to
be drawn about the increasing importance of professionalized self-reference,
and further the evolutionary step that has been taken by advertising in the direc-
tion of postmodern marketing communication. Hyperreality is being advanced as
the solution to problems that have been created as a result of G-D logic informed
advertising strategies. However, with hyperreal advertising the problems do not
disappear; rather, in the second-order information of postmodern marketing
communications, the recipient is informed of the distancing of the advertising
from itself by the advertising itself – and in so doing, the communicative problems
of advertising become even more visible. To put it in a nutshell, today’s advertis-
ing informs its audiences about the disinformation that advertising is no longer
advertising.

II Information and Disinformation through
Advertising


Roland Mangold
2.1 Human Processing of Commercial
Information in Digital Environments
Abstract: In theories of advertising eﬀects attention is generally considered as
being most essential for consumers’ processing of commercial messages. Espe-
cially in digital media environments where many diﬀerent information sources
compete for the users’ attention and where the next channel is only a ﬁngertip
away it is import to provide content that satisﬁes the users’ needs and is attrac-
tive to them. The good news is: information processing with reduced attention
can also result in intended eﬀects. To understand which speciﬁc conditions
cause such eﬀects and what diﬀerent kinds of eﬀects are to be expected, active
psychological research on advertising in digital media settings is necessary. In
this paper, selected results from this research will be discussed in the framework
of a limited-capacity model of human information processing.
1 Introduction
In almost every model of advertising eﬀects attention is considered as being a
crucial factor for commercial information to be eﬀective. As the total capacity
that is available in the human mental architecture for the processing of input
information is limited (Mangold 2015), and as many diﬀerent information sources
compete for the consumer’s attention, commercial information might not get the
capacity necessary to elicit intended eﬀects on memory, attitude formation, or
decision behaviour.
In the traditional mass media (printed matter, radio, television), advertisers
have been confronted with a balancing act between either making commercial
information more salient by putting it in the foreground or by moving it more
into the background, and thus being confronted with the risk that it might to
be missed by consumers. For example, when a television viewer is watching a
commercial spot there is not a high probability that important product informa-
tion will be missed. However, commercial spots tend to be evaluated negatively
by viewers and processing might fail because consumers use commercial breaks
to look at the TV guide or their smartphone, to talk to each other, or even to
leave the room. Product placements on the other hand, are evaluated more
positively and viewers tend to stay in front of the TV and follow the TV pro-
gramme they are embedded in. But product placements have a signiﬁcantly

higher probability of being overlooked. Consequently, despite their tendentially
negative image radio or television spots have been preferred for commercial
communication, as long as not too many alternative programme channels have
been oﬀered to the radio or TV audience, and as long as it took some eﬀort to
switch channels.
The situation is becoming more complicated in digital media environments.
Users still have a limited capacity for the processing of input information, but
meanwhile there are many more sources from which information can be
accessed. Furthermore, switching to another channel is much easier in digital
environments: the next video and the next website are only the click of the
mouse or the touch of a ﬁnger away. That is, consumers tend to be less motivated
to stick with the processing of information from media they are not interested in,
because it requires so little eﬀort to ﬁnd a better alternative.
As a consequence, the designers of commercial messages in digital media
environments should take consumers’ speciﬁc needs relating to the given infor-
mation into account more carefully, in order to achieve the degree of attention
necessary for intensive processing. But as the number of competing information
sources is considerably higher, and as a perfect match between the content
oﬀered and users’ needs probably might not be possible, research is required
on the eﬀects that might be expected even in cases where commercial informa-
tion is processed with reduced attention.
In the next section an architecture for consumer-information processing will
be introduced that oﬀers an appropriate framework for the discussion of the
above questions. Then, the speciﬁc needs of users that are satisﬁed during their
interaction with digital media will be discussed. A limited number of basic
human needs have been identiﬁed in empirical studies that are relevant both to
the content, as well as the interactivity provided by digital media. In addition, a
method will be described that is speciﬁcally adapted to revealing the users’
needs that are being satisﬁed or not during their interaction with digital media.
Following that, the eﬀectiveness of processing commercial information with a
low receptive capacity will be discussed, and the relationship between allocated
capacity and diﬀerent kinds of eﬀects will be explained. If such an unconscious
processing of input information is possible it has to be discussed as to whether
this establishes the opportunity to disinform or even manipulate consumers.
2 An Architecture for Consumer Information
Processing
In this paper a modiﬁed version of Lang’s (Lang 2000, 2009) limited capacity
model of mediated motivated message processing (LC4MP) has been chosen to
76
Roland Mangold

explain advertising eﬀects in digital media environments (see ﬁg. 1). A speciﬁc
feature of this model is an implemented mechanism of capacity allocation that
provides an appropriate explanation for the eﬀects of processing information
with a varying attention capacity. Cognitive information processing, and motiva-
tion and emotion, are controlled by two separate subsystems thus enabling
a detailed explanation of interactions between cognitive and motivational/
emotional states.
In the LC4MP humans are conceived of as systems which permanently
exchange information with their physical environment. Information processing
is performed by an architecture that receives information from the outer world
through the senses (predominantly the visual and the auditory senses), decodes
this information (i.e. understands it), processes this information (e.g. thinks
about it), and possibly acts on its environment according to processing results.
Information input from the environment is represented by structured patterns
of physical energy that stimulate the human’s sensory organs. Initially, these
patterns of energy can be conceived of as data; only if a meaning can be assigned
to them, will they become information for the individual. In this view, information
is identical to symbolic patterns that are connected to (inner) meaning by the
information processing system.

2000, 2009)

During encoding the system ﬁrst attempts to ﬁnd an appropriate meaning
for the data pattern transported from the senses to the working memory. If this
process succeeds, a representation of the environment will be constructed in the
working memory that serves as a basis for subsequent processing (e.g. thinking,
problem solving, deciding and judging). To be able to assign a meaning to input
data, knowledge has to be retrieved from the long term memory. Important
processing results may in turn be stored in the long term memory. As it might
be necessary during processing to retain some information for a limited duration
(e.g. for intermediate results when performing a calculation), ﬁve to nine informa-
tion elements (e.g. single units such as digits or letters, but also more complex
chunks such as numbers or words) can be stored temporarily in the short term
memory. Information processing may ﬁnally result in an instruction for the
motoric system to initiate an action, but this is not a necessary consequence of
operations in the working memory.
The upper part of the architecture displayed in ﬁg. 1 is called the cognitive or
representational subsystem, because here representations of the environment are
constructed. In the lower part of ﬁg. 1 the second subsystem is responsible for
dealing with the motivational and emotional states of the individual. Emotions
and motivations (needs, goals, and gratiﬁcations) are strongly interconnected:
if a person’s needs are satisﬁed, this person will experience positive emotions.
If however, an expected need satisfaction is frustrated, the person will experi-
ence negative emotions. Emotional and motivational states also aﬀect the way
in which information is processed by the representation system.
A central assumption in Lang’s (2000, 2009) LC4MP is that every process
being executed in the architecture needs capacity. The amount of capacity that
has to be allocated to a process in order to ensure proper execution is variable:
“easy” (i.e. superﬁcial) processes that do not require much concentration can be
performed with less. For example, well trained and thus automatically running
processes (like riding a bicycle or driving a car) are typical low capacity processes.
“Deep” (i.e. thorough) processes however, that require concentration for their
proper execution need a higher capacity. A process that requires a high capacity
for thorough and deep operation but does not get it will operate superﬁcially
and will thus be imprecise.
Processes running with a high capacity diﬀer from processes running on
low capacity with regard to certain characteristics:
–
High capacity processes are voluntarily controllable, their operation is governed
by rules, and information is processed in a logical and rational way. During
processing, the system searches for the overall best solution for a problem.
The individual is consciously aware of the processing that is going on, and
the processing details as well as results can be retained in memory.

–
Low capacity processes on the other hand, evade voluntary control, and the
processing style is heuristic, following “rule of the thumb” rather than the
rule of logic and rationality. As a result, low capacity processes provide an
approximation of good, but not necessarily the best solutions. They operate
unconsciously, and the process details are not stored in memory.
A second central assumption within the LC4MP is that the total amount of
capacity available for processing in the system is limited. That is, the allocation
of processing capacity is compensatory: if one process gets more capacity for
operation, other processes being executed at the same time will get less. This is
the reason for the fact that although humans in principle are able to process
more than one information source in parallel (e.g. thinking about a problem
while riding a bicycle), only one process can be really deep and thorough, while
all other processes will operate superﬁcially. This mechanism constitutes no
restrictions for habitual and therefore low capacity demanding processes (such
as the routine activities already mentioned). But in principle, as soon as at least
two require a higher level of capacity for suﬃciently deep and thorough opera-
tion, only one will get enough capacity, while others will only function in a
superﬁcial manner – the person experiences cognitive overload.
To summarize, the demands of diﬀerent processes for a variable level of
capacity are strongly related to the kind of processing (deep and rule-governed
or superﬁcial and heuristic). Processes not receiving the capacity they would
require for thorough operation will only attain superﬁcially computed results.
But what are the principles according to which capacity is allocated to currently
operating processes? What are the factors that determine whether a process will
get more or less capacity? The following determinants are mentioned in Lang’s
(2000, 2009) publications:
–
Voluntary control: Despite the fact that people generally tend to assume that
they have a strong voluntary inﬂuence on the way in which information is
processed in their heads, the eﬀects of voluntarily capacity allocation to
selected processes is only weak. This becomes obvious from the example
where a student is learning for his exam. If he is not very much interested
in the topic, learning becomes tedious and even after many repetitions
learning success is only moderate. There doesn’t seem to be a way of just
voluntarily increasing the capacity allocated to learning and thus with a
simple trick improve learning.
–
Characteristics of the stimulus: Attention will be very much attracted by stimuli
that are salient to a person. Stimulus saliency is determined by stimulus
properties like size, colour, movement, or loudness. For example, an ad
which is big and displays loud colours will probably get more attention
Human Processing of Commercial Information in Digital Environments
79

capacity than small and colourless stimuli. If a stimulus with not very
salient features per se (e.g. an uncoloured ad) diﬀers considerably from its
context (e.g. with coloured text and pictures), it becomes salient by that.
–
Motivation: Capacity will be allocated automatically to the processing of
stimulus information that is related to a person’s interests, needs, goals, or
expected gratiﬁcations. Having the right motivation is a much stronger
determinant for capacity allocation than any of the other factors listed here.
–
Emotions: In numerous empirical studies the inﬂuence of mood on the style
of thinking has been demonstrated (cf. Bless, Fiedler 2006). When in a bad
mood people think in a stricter, more rule-based, and more logical manner.
In a good mood however, people think more superﬁcially, they use heuristics,
and are more creative. It is quite obvious that emotion-dependent diﬀerences
in information processing are related to diﬀerences in capacity allocation: in
a negative emotional state more capacity will be allocated to processing
input information than in a positive state. An explanation for this relation-
ship is given by cognitive tuning theory (Kuschel et al. 2010): emotional
states serve as information about processing demands, and with this infor-
mation the system can tune its processing activities to maximum perfor-
mance in the existing environment. If a person is in a bad mood this signals
that some kind of problem needs to be solved. As problem solving requires
logical and thorough thinking, the system assigns most of the capacity
available to these cognitive operations. A good mood, on the other hand,
indicates the nonexistence of problems, and as a consequence there is no
need to allocate so much capacity to information processing.
3 Satisfaction of Consumer Needs in Digital
Environments
As has been indicated in the previous section motivation is one of the dominant
factors for the allocation of capacity. Accordingly, if an advertiser’s intention is
to get enough capacity for his commercial message to be processed deeply and
thoroughly, he should provide messages that optimally satisfy the customers’
needs. Need satisfaction is aﬀected by messages in digital media in two diﬀerent
ways. For one, content can be provided to the user that matches his or her
interests, goals, gratiﬁcation expectations etc. For the other, the interaction with
the interface of the digital media can be more or less satisfactory.
A number of theoretical approaches to basic human needs have been
published. What these studies have in common is that the needs postulated by
80
Roland Mangold

the authors are based on empirically collected data. Data from interviews or
questionnaires have been submitted to statistical complexity reduction with pro-
cedures such as factor analysis. As a result between three and sixteen basic
need dimensions have been found. Although it is assumed in these approaches
that the set of needs reported in the publications applies to everyone, the inten-
sity of each need varies between individuals. So a need proﬁle can be identiﬁed
for every human being in which some needs are more prominent, while others
have a weaker intensity.
–
Reiss and Haverkamp (1998) claim to have found in total sixteen basic
desires which form the so called Reiss proﬁle. The basic needs in their
model are acceptance, curiosity, eating, family, honour, idealism, indepen-
dence, order, physical activity, power, romance, saving, social contact,
social status, tranquillity, and vengeance.
–
Ryan and Deci (2000) in their self-determination theory assume three basic
need dimensions: competence, relatedness, and autonomy.
–
Sheldon et al. (2001) report having found ten diﬀerent basic needs: self-
esteem, autonomy, competence, relatedness, pleasure-stimulation, physical
thriving, self-actualization-meaning, security, popularity-inﬂuence, and money/
luxury.
The determination of to what extent certain basic needs are aﬀected by a product,
a service or a commercial message is complicated by the fact that customers
tend not to be consciously aware of their own needs. As a solution, the laddering
interview has been developed by Reynolds and Gutman (1988). Laddering is an
interview technique used in marketing research to gain insight into how the
needs of customers are aﬀected by products. This method is based on means-
end chain theory (Gutman 1982) according to which customers have cognitive
combinations in their minds consisting of the attributes of products (means)
and goals (ends). If the attributes and goals match, the product is evaluated
positively by the customer because it satisﬁes his needs.
When conducting a laddering interview for a speciﬁc product the inter-
viewee will ﬁrst become acquainted with the product and its features. Then the
interviewer tries to ﬁnd out which of the product’s properties are most salient to
the consumer. For example, if a person is testing a bio-soy burger the attributes
“healthy”, “vegetarian” and “sustainable” might be most important to him. Then
by subsequently asking why-questions the speciﬁc meaning of these attributes
to the test person are uncovered. For example, the interviewee might connect
the property “vegetarian” to the fact that for this food no animal had to be
slaughtered, which in turn is connected to one of his central values. It may also
be possible that a product has disadvantageous features. For example, when
Human Processing of Commercial Information in Digital Environments
81

cosmetics have been tested using animals this may conﬂict with the customer’s
value of not killing animals for economic purposes. It is obvious that the same
property of a product might have diﬀerent beneﬁts for diﬀerent people. This
reﬂects the fact that the proﬁle of needs varies from person to person.
Laddering is a well-established method for uncovering the needs that are
aﬀected by the properties of a product. However, without modiﬁcation it is not
applicable to identifying the features of interactive media (e.g. the interface of a
website or a software), that satisfy certain needs of the user, as laddering is not
designed to capture dynamic and time dependent features. As an alternative the
valence method has been developed on the basis of the means-end chain theory
by Burmester et al. (2010). These authors assume that certain design features of
the interface (e.g. interaction elements, interaction styles) are more prominent to
the user than others. While interacting with this interface in the experience phase
the user presses a green button whenever he experiences positive emotions. If
a negative emotional state occurs the user indicates this with a red button. In
the subsequent interview phase the user will be interviewed about those sections
of the interaction that he has previously marked. Again, similar to laddering,
subjects are asked what properties of the media have caused the positive (or
negative) emotion, what the reason for this emotion is and what meaning the
property of the interface has for the user. In the subsequent analysis the basic
needs underlying the combination of interface properties and emotional states
will be identiﬁed.
4 Low Capacity Consumer Information Processing
If a commercial message to customers cannot satisfy their needs to an extent, it
requires them to process that information attentively and deeply, this does not
necessarily exclude the eﬀects of that message. An experiment most frequently
cited in this context was conducted by Vicary (Mangold 2015, p. 142). In 1957, in
a cinema in Fort Lee (USA), he presented a movie to the audience which con-
tained messages such as “eat popcorn” or “drink Coca-Cola”. The presentation
time of these messages was too short for conscious recognition. Vicary reported
an increase of popcorn sales of 58% and Coca-Cola sales of 18% during the
interval. Obviously “subliminal” processing of information input (i.e. processing
below the threshold of consciousness) can aﬀect decisions and corresponding
behaviour of humans. As an inspection of Vicary’s original data is not possible,
and as it has even been assumed that Vicary’s study was a fake to promote his
newly established marketing agency (Danzig 1962), a replication with similar
82
Roland Mangold

experimental conditions has been published by Karremans et al. (2006). In
this study subjects were instructed to identify on a computer screen the strings
out of a series that contained lower case letters. Before each task a prime was
presented for 23 milliseconds. In control conditions the prime consisted of the
letters “NPEIC TOIL”. In the experimental conditions the letters were rearranged
to make the words “LIPTON ICE”. After having ﬁnished the tasks, subjects were
asked whether they wanted mineral water or iced tea to drink. In the control
conditions 31% of the subjects and in the experimental conditions 54% chose
the iced tea. In a replication of this experiment subjects ate a salty candy before
they solved the tasks. Now 20% of the thirsty subjects in the control conditions
decided for iced tea, whereas 85% in the experimental conditions made this
choice. Obviously, the eﬀect of unconsciously processing advertising informa-
tion is considerably stronger if the subjects experience a speciﬁc need that is
related to the unconsciously processed input information.
Studies on the unconscious processing of commercial information have so
far predominantly been conducted using experimental settings that resemble
mass media reception. Are the results also transferable to digital media environ-
ments? At least for the presentation of banner ads on websites, Yoo (2008) was
able to demonstrate similar eﬀects. The author presented three diﬀerent web-
pages to subjects for a duration of 45 seconds each. In the two experimental
conditions each page displayed an advertising banner at the top with varying
brand information. One group of subjects was asked to carefully evaluate the
page, thus assuming that they would focus their attention both on content as
well as on the advertisement (the attentive group). Subjects in a second group
were instructed that they should understand the content of the page and that
they would be submitted to a comprehension test afterwards. This instruction
was intended to focus their attention on the content and distract it from the
banners (the distracted group). In a control group no advertising banners were
present on the pages. As a task subjects were asked to complete word stems
(like S T R _ _ _) to full words. For the analysis the number of completed words
that were present on the banners was counted. Further, a recognition test
was conducted. Results of this explicit test of brand memory demonstrated that
subjects in the attentive group remembered signiﬁcantly more brand words than
those in the distracted group, who did not have a better memory performance
than the control group. According to this experiment the processing of banner
information with a low capacity seems to have little eﬀect on memory.
The resulting pattern is diﬀerent however, if the results for the word comple-
tion task are examined. In the control group only 36% of the word fragments
were completed into words that were displayed on the banners. In contrast, in
the attentive group 57%, and in the distracted group 55% of completed words
Human Processing of Commercial Information in Digital Environments
83

were identical to words that were also part of the banner messages. In addition,
subjects from both experimental groups exhibited a more positive attitude
towards the brands presented on the banners, and more frequently assigned
the brands to a consideration set of ﬁve products they might buy compared to
members of the control group. Similar to many other studies Yoo (2008) was able
to demonstrate that even processing advertising information with only a low level
of capacity can result in eﬀects that are in the interests of the advertisers. Eﬀects
induced in low capacity processing conditions are called implicit because they
are not conscious to the person and cannot be measured directly with methods
like questionnaires. As implicit eﬀects are inherent to information processing
but not based on information explicitly stored in memory, they can only be
made observable indirectly by methods such as reaction time measurement,
free association, word completion, or the misattribution of feelings.
Despite the impressive number of studies demonstrating implicit eﬀects,
there is still a lack of theoretical approaches that can serve as a framework for
explanation. According the LC4MP low capacity processing is uncontrollable,
unconscious, more superﬁcial, and without memory trace. But this model does
not deﬁne a processing structure that is causal to the diﬀerences. A model
published by Gawronski and Bodenhausen (2006) not only includes assump-
tions about the two diﬀerent levels of human information processing, but it
also incorporates statements regarding an architecture in which these two
diﬀerent modes of processing are carried out.
According to the associative propositional evaluation model (APEM), infor-
mation input to the sensory system will be processed in parallel in two diﬀerent
structures. In the associative subsystem (lower part of ﬁg. 2) information elements
(e.g. brand names or product properties) are represented by nodes in a network.
Nodes can have varying activation states; the amount of activation reﬂects
the relevance of the element represented by the node for ongoing information
processing. Nodes are connected to each other, and activation will be propagated
from one (activated) node to connected nodes. The stronger the connections
between two nodes are, the more activation will be exchanged between them.
The spreading of activation is automatic and uncontrolled by the person. It
is also fast and concludes within a short space of time. When information is
presented to the system, sensory nodes are stimulated and activated. This
activation will automatically be spread to connected nodes and activate them
in turn. If, for example, a person is a fan of Apple smartphones, this positive
attitude is represented by nodes for positive properties (e.g. “good”, “modern”
or “cool”) that are strongly connected to the node for an Apple smartphone. If
a person sees such a smartphone (e.g. in the warehouse or in a commercial),
this will automatically activate nodes which represent positive properties. The
84
Roland Mangold

resulting activation pattern then, represents the meaning or the attitude formed
by the associative system.
In parallel to activation spreading, a process is initiated in the propositional
subsystem. Here information processing is rule-governed: symbolic information
in the system is modiﬁed according to rules (i.e. program instructions) by a
central processor. Processing that follows the rules of logic and rationality is
deep and thorough. Processing in the propositional structure is slower and
requires more capacity than associative processing. When a person does not
have much capacity available for the processing of certain information – for
example, when not much time is left for a decision or when other capacity-
consuming processes are executed at the same time – there is a high probability
that processing results will mostly reﬂect the operation of the associative system.
However, when enough capacity is available, processing will be completed within
the propositional architecture.
These assumptions have been corroborated by results from a study conducted
by Shiv and Fedorikhin (1999). In an experiment, two groups of subjects were
instructed to retain either a two-digit or an eight-digit number while they crossed
a room. Before they had to recall the number at the other side of the room they

based on Gawronski, Bodenhausen 2006)

85

were confronted with two kinds of dessert: subjects could choose between a
tasty looking chocolate cake or a healthy fruit salad. After they had decided on
one of the sweets subjects were asked to recall the (two or eight digit) number.
The analysis reveals a strong inﬂuence of the experimental conditions on
the preference for chocolate cake or fruit salad. In the eight-digit conditions,
subjects more frequently chose chocolate cake than in the two-digit conditions.
An explanation for this result can be given within the APEM framework: retain-
ing a two-digit number is a relatively easy task that does not require a large
amount of capacity. That is, when subjects were deciding on one of the two
desserts they had enough capacity left for a decision process at the proposi-
tional level. Here the more frequent decision for fruit salad was quite rational
and well founded. Subjects who had to retain an eight-digit number, however,
did not have much capacity left for coming to a decision and were only able to
process information at the associative level. In the associative subsystem more
positive properties are connected to chocolate cake than to fruit salad which
triggered the decision in favour of the high calorie sweet. That both the associa-
tive and the propositional subsystem are operating in parallel is demonstrated
by the observation that subjects deciding for fruit salad reported that at ﬁrst
they impulsively tended to go for chocolate cake but in the end decided to be
reasonable and take the fruit salad. Obviously, although the associative decision
process came to a conclusion earlier the state of the associative system was
overwritten by the outcome of the propositional process.
To summarize, at least implicit eﬀects (like stimulating brand associations
or improving attitudes toward the brand) can also be found in situations in
which advertising information is processed with only a low level of capacity
by media users. These eﬀects are not conscious to the person and can only be
veriﬁed using speciﬁc methods of indirect measurement. Implicit eﬀects can
appropriately be explained according to the APEM as being based on associative
processing, that is, on the spread of activation between nodes linked to each
other.
5 Conclusion
According to the model introduced in this paper media recipients have a limited
capacity for the processing of the commercial information oﬀered to them.
Advertising in traditional mass media always has been confronted with the
problem that only a fraction of mediated information is processed intensively
by the recipients. The good news is: processing with low capacity may also be
86
Roland Mangold

eﬀective in certain ways. For example, latent needs can be made salient and
intensiﬁed (Karremans et al. 2006).
Meanwhile our media environment has changed radically; digital media
provide an uncountable number of diﬀerent sources oﬀering multimedia infor-
mation which is accessible through interactive interfaces. But the way in which
information oﬀered by the media is processed in the human cognitive architec-
ture still remains the same: the users’ capacity is limited, and only a highly
restricted number of information sources can be processed at the same time.
But today, users have many more options for alternative information and it is
quite easy and eﬀortless for them to switch to a competitive channel. One option
to get the users’ attention and interest is to provide content and interactivity that
is related to his or her currently active needs. But even in situations where
media users do not pay much attention to advertising in digital media it still
can be eﬀective and match the advertiser’s intentions (Yoo 2008).
As priming studies demonstrate, commercial information will also be pro-
cessed unconsciously and can inﬂuence a person’s thinking, decisions, and
actions. As she is not aware of this impact – doesn’t this set the stage for disin-
formation or even manipulation of consumers, especially in digital media? The
answer is: no. Results from priming studies reveal that unconscious priming can
only make existing (latent) needs obvious and salient to the subject and thus
intensify them. However, it could never be shown that this priming mechanism
allows the creation of new and previously non-existing needs or motivates sub-
jects to make decisions that are contradictory to their general intentions. Despite
all the diﬀerences – with respect to the motivated and unconscious processing
of advertising information, new digital media environments are very similar to
the traditional mass media.

2.2 Trade Practices and Consumer
Disinformation
Abstract: The last decade the European consumer information model has been
the subject of increasing criticism, not in the least from scholars of non-legal
disciplines. The information paradigm whereupon this model is based takes as
a starting point that consumers are beneﬁt-maximising creatures who, when
given full information, will consistently make decisions that maximise their
welfare. Precisely the assumption that informed consumer decisions are eﬃcient
decisions is increasingly challenged nowadays. Especially the fact that the
release of information in the market is not non-committal in cases where that
information empowers him to correct his misleading impressions based on
particulars of the product or in advertising, is subject of criticism. To date, these
critiques are of no speciﬁc concern to the European legislator. Recent harmoni-
sation measures continue to be heavily rooted in the European information
model. Also the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive is not well equipped to
combat, for example, disinformation as a result of an overload of information.
However, recent developments in case law demonstrate the ECJ’s willingness to
mitigate the consumer’s duty to internalise information for his own good. Yet,
the European legislator seems far better placed to deal with the drawbacks of
the information model and should, in that respect, approach valuable insights
from other disciplines with an open mind.
1 Introduction
In view of the establishment of the internal market the European legislator de-
veloped a European consumer information model. Although consumers auto-
matically beneﬁt from more competitive market structures they also must be
secured a legal environment wherein they are capable of searching out bargains
between goods and services oﬀered and sold across borders. Thus a consumer
must be made capable of reaping full beneﬁt from the internal market by making
purchase decisions in full knowledge of the fact. This requires the release of infor-
mation in the absence of which consumers would fail to fulﬁl their function in the
internal market. The European preference for information disclosure measures
comes as no surprise. The economic theories underlying the internal market

policy presuppose that the release of information can hardly have a negative
impact on the market. Quite the opposite, these theories approach the consumer
as a beneﬁt-maximising creature who will consistently make decisions that
maximise his welfare if he is given full information. It follows that informed
consumer decisions are eﬃcient decisions. This so-called information paradigm
lies at the core of the European consumer information model. Factor in that
information requirements are much more in line with the internal market objec-
tives than straightforward prohibitions, as they are much less inhibitive to trade,
and the ﬁnding that European harmonisation measures are heavily focused on
disclosure mandates was only to be expected.
The European consumer information model will be brieﬂy highlighted in
section 2, with special attention to relevant European legislation (subsection A)
and case law of the European Court of Justice (subsection B). In the last decade
the European consumer information model has been the subject of increasing
criticism not least from behavioural economics scholars. Section 3 of this contri-
bution highlights the critiques. In a subsequent section it will be examined
whether Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices (hereafter: UCPD)
is capable of responding to those critiques. The protection of consumers against
misleading practices forms an important, if not the most important, part of the
aforementioned directive. This directive is of general application and therefore
deserves separate attention. Finally, a concluding section completes the analysis.
2 The Internal Market and the European
Consumer Information Model
To provide for the appropriate measures in view of the establishment and correct
functioning of the (internal) market lies at the core of the European Union.1
Companies and consumers would both beneﬁt from more eﬃcient market struc-
tures. However, for the internal market to yield its beneﬁts to consumers they
must be able to have easy access to goods and services promoted, oﬀered and
sold across the borders,2 since it is the cross-border movement of goods and
services that allows consumers to search out bargains and innovative products
and services and ensures that they optimise their consumption decisions.3 For
this system to work the release of private consumer autonomy within the market

is presupposed.4 This implies a consumer who is looked at as a beneﬁt-maximising
creature capable of reaping full beneﬁt from the internal market by making
purchase decisions in full knowledge of the facts.5 The consumer’s right to
choose the goods and services closest to his preferences also requires a certain
empowerment of consumers. Hence, information must be disclosed to consumers.6
By impairing the consumer’s ability to make choices which are informed
and therefore eﬃcient,7 unfair commercial practices generate a market failure.
Consequently misleading practices were prohibited and mandated disclosures
were imposed on businesses to combat the market ineﬃciencies resulting from
the information asymmetry that exists between companies and consumers.8 This
explains why the earliest consumer measures were mainly concerned with
misleading information in two central domains, namely advertising rules and
labelling requirements.
As a result of the informational empowerment of consumers the idea that
consumers were genuine promoters of integration instead of passive beneﬁciaries
gained ground fairly rapidly.9 Hence the focus of European legislation shifted to

7 Economic theory presupposes that information can never have a negative impact. If the infor-
mation is ineﬀective or irrelevant, it will simply be ignored by consumers and businesses. If
consumers are given full information, they will consistently make decisions that maximise their
welfare. Hence informed consumer decisions are eﬃcient.
8 Consumers have less information than businesses and so have diﬃculty in making decisions
that reﬂect their true preferences. Businesses themselves have no suﬃcient incentives to provide
consumers with the information they need. Therefore the law comes to the aid of consumers and
requires the information be provided. See also G. Howells, “The Potential and Limits of Consumer
Empowerment by Information”, Journal of Law and Society 2005, Vol.32, (349) 355, who points
out that “harm will be reduced by ensuring goods and services are more likely to be in line with
realistic consumer expectations based on reliable information. Avoiding problems through the
consumer taking responsibility for his or her own purchasing choices must be a desirable objec-
tive. Moreover, this accords with popular support for the notion of consumer autonomy and
avoids criticisms of paternalism from the nanny-state”. That way “information rules empower
consumers to protect themselves and have the advantage that they are not prescriptive and so
do not prevent traders innovating”, a.c., 356.
9 In the Third Action plan on consumer policy, Brussels, COM(95)0519, the consumer is already
referred to as a full-blown participant, a key player in the internal market, and also as a person
who is able to make well-informed choices and who is suﬃciently alert to defend his own
rights.

the establishment of a legislative environment in which consumer’s conﬁdence
may grow, enabling the conﬁdent consumer to become the new benchmark of
the internal market.
A Consumer Information Model – Legislative Developments
Two ground breaking harmonisation measures secured consumers the informa-
tion they need to participate in the internal market, the foodstuﬀs labelling
directive and the directive on misleading advertising. The aim of both directives
was to prevent any deception of consumers. Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December
1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the
labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuﬀs for sale to the ultimate
consumer10 prohibits the misleading of purchasers as to the characteristics11 of
foodstuﬀs and also contains compulsory rules to indicate a number of foodstuﬀ
particulars, for instance a list of ingredients on labelling. Directive 79/112/EEC is
of general application and has been replaced by Directive 2000/13/EC12 which in
its turn has been repealed as from 13 December 2014 by Regulation 1169/2011/EU
on the provision of food information to consumers13. Article 13 (1) of the Regula-
tion requires mandatory food information to be “marked in a conspicuous place
in such a way as to be easily visible, clearly legible, and where appropriate
indelible. It shall not in any way be hidden, obscured, detracted from or
interrupted by any other written or pictorial matter or any other intervening
material”. It further contains rules as regards the font size and characters of
mandatory particulars and rules concerning distance selling and the omission
of certain mandatory particulars.
Directive 84/450/EEC concerning misleading advertising14 harmonised the
deﬁnition of ‘misleading advertising’15. In contrast to the labelling directive this
directive did not stop Member States from retaining or adopting provisions with
a view to ensuring more extensive protection for consumers.

Although it was initially believed that both instruments conveyed suﬃcient
information to consumers to make them beneﬁciaries from increased competition
in the market, the shift towards the establishment of a legislative environment in
which consumers’ conﬁdence may grow required the release of more informa-
tion. As a result, all harmonisation measures targeted at protecting consumers
included from that date an impressive number of pre-contractual information
obligations imposed on traders.
For instance according to Article 5(1) of the recent Consumer Rights Direc-
tive16 (hereafter: CRD) the trader shall provide the consumer with no less than
20 information particulars before the consumer is bound by the contract. This
information must be provided in a clear and comprehensible manner if that infor-
mation is not already apparent from the context. In providing that information,
“the trader should take into account the speciﬁc needs of consumers who are
particularly vulnerable because of their mental, physical or psychological inﬁrmity,
age or credulity, in a way which the trader could reasonably be expected to
foresee” (own emphasis)17. However, the directive peculiarly adds on this point
that “taking into account such speciﬁc needs should not lead to diﬀerent levels
of consumer protection”18.
The directive also contains rules that are more targeted to the media user.
The trader must provide the user of any new media which concludes a distance
contract the more detailed information provided for in Article 6(1) or make that
information available to the consumer in a way appropriate to the means of
distance communication used in plain and intelligible language (own emphasis).
Additional information requirements apply to distance contracts concluded by
electronic means that place consumers under an obligation to pay.19 Unlike the
general pre-contractual information obligations, these obligations concerning
distance contracts set forth in the CRD are completely harmonised so that no
interference from Member States is allowed.
Users of media are further protected by the Electronic Commerce Directive20,
the Services Directive21 and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive22. The
Services Directive and the E-commerce Directive also contain pre-contractual infor-
mation requirements additional to those laid down in the CRD.23 However, if a

17 Article 5(3) from the UCPD holds a similar provision. See also on this point, albeit from a
diﬀerent angle, the contribution of Förster/Weish to this book.

provision of Directive 2006/123/EC (services) or Directive 2000/31/EC (e-commerce)
on the content and the manner in which the information is to be provided
conﬂicts with a provision of the CRD, the provision of the latter will prevail.
This means that only in cases of conﬂicting requirements is the complementary
nature of the directives estopped in favour of the CRD.
Although the UCPD merely prohibits misleading24 and aggressive com-
mercial practices and does not impose information requirements as such, it
nevertheless contains indirect information duties with respect to invitations to
purchase25. In the case of invitations to purchase a trader has according to
Article 7(4) of the UCPD a stricter obligation to provide information, failure of
which may constitute a misleading omission. This material information partly
overlaps with the information requirements imposed by the CRD. Both lists of
information duties must be complied with when the advertising is categorized
as an invitation to purchase. Yet again, in the case of conﬂict the CRD prevails.
It follows from the foregoing that directives on consumer protection, and
more in particular on the protection of media users, continue to pile on informa-
tion requirements. Some of the requirements26 referred to above are open to
interpretation and leave broad discretion to the judges. Also the obligation to
take into account the special needs of particularly vulnerable consumers is
rather unclear, especially in the CRD where this tailoring of information may
not lead to diﬀerent levels of consumer protection.
B Consumer Information Model – Case Law of the European
Court of Justice (ECJ)
The ECJ highly contributed to the development of the information model. On
many occasions, it has been asked to clarify the information model and the
information duties laid down in the aforementioned directives. It thereby comes
as no surprise that the ECJ’s approach towards the two central pillars of the
European information model, advertising and labelling, has been basically
24 It repeals and incorporates the misleading advertising directive referred to above.
25 The ECJ interpreted an invitation to purchase broadly: “an invitation to purchase exists as
soon as the information on the product advertised and its price is suﬃcient for the consumer
to be able to make a transactional decision, without it being necessary for the commercial com-
munication also to oﬀer an actual opportunity to purchase the product or for it to appear in
connection with such an opportunity” (para. 33, ECJ 12 May 2011, case C-122/10, Ving Sverige,
ECLI:EU:C:2011:299).
26 For instance requirements such as ‘easy to understand’, ‘in plain language’ etc.

the same.27 In the case that the consumer was able to make informed choices,
market deregulation prevailed over national regulatory protection.
It is precisely in that regard that the Court consistently held that the assess-
ment whether an appellation, brand name or advertising statement may be
misleading must take into account the presumed expectations of an average
consumer who is reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circum-
spect.28 This benchmark of the European average consumer has its origin in the
prime consideration taken from the non-binding preliminary programmes for a
consumer protection and information policy that consumers should be enabled
to make a choice in the market in full knowledge of the facts.29 The emergence
of this European consumer image was implicitly present in misleading practices
cases like GB-Inno-BM30, Yves Rocher31 and Mars32, and was subsequently con-
solidated in the Gut Springenheide and Tusky case33. It has been conﬁrmed since
in case law, and also more recently in legislation34.
With regard to labelling requirements, the ECJ emphasized that the rational
consumer whose purchasing decisions depend also on the composition of the
products will ﬁrst read the list of ingredients. As a result the average consumer

schappen, 1998, 197–466.
28 See in particular, ECJ 1999, Sektkellerei Kessler, Case C-303/97, EU:C:1999: 35, para. 36.
Thereby, the ECJ was not particularly inspired by human information processing models taken
from other disciplines. See for example the Limited Capacity Model of Mediated Message Process-
ing and the LC4MP developed by Lang and ﬁnd more about this model in the contribution of
Mangold to this book (chapter on human processing of commercial information).
29 ECJ 1990, C-362/88, GB-Inno-BM, EU:C:1990, para. 17: “a prohibition against importing certain
products into a Member State is contrary to (the provisions relating to free movement of goods)
where the aim of such a prohibition may be attained by appropriate labelling of the products
concerned which would provide the consumer with the information he needs and enable him
to make his choice in full knowledge of the facts” (own emphasis).
30 See ECJ 1990, C-362/88, GB-Inno-BM, EU:C:1990. The ECJ agreed with the European Com-
mission that any normally aware consumer knows that annual sales take place only twice a
year so that the ‘European’ consumers would not be misled by information on temporary price
reductions.
31 ECJ 18 May 1993, Yves Rocher, C-126/91, EU:C:1993. The Court held that the prohibition on
‘eye-catching’ advertising was disproportionate: it also prohibits correct advertising that is eye
catching.
32 ECJ 1995, Mars, C-470/93, EU:C:1995, paragraph 24: The ECJ held that “reasonably circum-
spect consumers may be deemed to know that there is not necessarily a link between the size
of publicity markings relating to an increase in a product’ s quantity and the size of that
increase”.
33 ECJ 1998, Tusky, C-210/96, EU:C:1998, para. 31.

on consumer rights (CRD).

who is “reasonably well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect” is
not misled by the use of a term on the label if the seemingly misleading impres-
sion the term entails is contradicted by the list of ingredients that duly indicates
the presence of all the ingredients in the product.35 Hence, a comprehensive
and correct list of ingredients on the packaging of a product may prevent a
consumer’s misleading impression derived from a term or depiction used on
the packaging of the product.36
Although the ECJ recognises that cases may exist where the requirement of
an additional statement to the trade description is necessary in order to avoid
any confusion on the part of consumers, it consistently struck down additional
national labelling requirements to that end. In Commission vs. Italy37, for instance,
the ECJ was opposed to the German prohibition to market hollandaise sauce or
béarnaise sauce prepared from vegetable fats instead of butter and eggs in
accordance with the recipe traditionally followed in Germany. The ECJ stated
that “for consumers who are heedful of the composition of a product, suﬃcient
information is available by way of the list of ingredients which (. . .) must appear
on the labelling”38. In the same vein, the ECJ held in Darbo39 that mentioning
‘naturrein’ on the packaging of strawberry jam gave consumers no misleading
impressions.40 It pointed out that “an average consumer who is reasonably
35 See to that eﬀect, e.g. ECJ 1999, Van der Laan, Case C-383/97, EU:C:1999:, para. 37.
36 See e.g. Severi, C‑446/07, EU:C:2009:530, paragraph 61, on the question whether the
designation of a foodstuﬀ, ‘Salame tipo Felino’, which is evocative of a place and which is not
registered as a PDO or PGI may be legitimately used by producers who use it uninterruptedly
for a considerable period and in good faith, is misleading. “It is clear from the Court’s case
law that, in order to assess the capacity to mislead of a description to be found on a label, the
national court must in essence take account of the presumed expectations, in light of that
description, of an average consumer who is reasonably well informed, and reasonably observant
and circumspect, as to the origin, provenance, and quality associated with the foodstuﬀ, the
critical point being that the consumer must not be misled and must not be induced to believe,
incorrectly, that the product has an origin, provenance or quality which are other than
genuine”.

well informed and reasonably observant and circumspect could not be misled
by the term ‘naturally pure’ used on the label simply because the jam con-
tains pectin gelling agent whose presence is duly indicated on the list of its
ingredients”41.
Also, in the misleading advertising cases, the ECJ emphasized that the Euro-
pean average consumer has the duty to internalize the information which is
disclosed to him in the market.42 The Clinique43 case is illustrative of that
point. In that case the German Government sought to stop the use of the name
“Clinique” for cosmetic products on the ground that that name could mislead
consumers into believing that the products in question had medicinal properties.
The ECJ adequately countered the German objections. It stated “that the range of
cosmetic products manufactured by the Estée Lauder Company is sold in the
Federal Republic of Germany exclusively in perfumeries and cosmetic depart-
ments of large stores, and therefore none of those products is available in
pharmacies. It is not disputed that those products are presented as cosmetic
products and not as medicinal products. It is not suggested that, apart from
the name of the products, this presentation does not comply with the rules
applicable to cosmetic products. Finally, according to the very wording of the
question referred, those products are ordinarily marketed in other countries
under the name “Clinique” and the use of that name apparently does not
mislead consumers”44. Hence the German prohibition did not appear to be
necessary to satisfy the requirement of consumer protection and human health.
The Court therefore added: “The clinical or medical connotations of the word
“Clinique” are not suﬃcient to make that word so misleading as to justify the
prohibition of its use on products marketed in the aforesaid circumstances”
(own emphasis)45.
The importance of this last sentence cannot be overlooked. Even though the
ECJ recognises that it is not excluded that German consumers may wrongfully
infer from the product name that it has medicinal qualities, this is not suﬃcient
to prohibit the use of that name as deceptive. The product is presented as a

cosmetic product, its presentation complies with the speciﬁc labelling require-
ments laid down in European directives, and the product can only be bought
outside pharmacies. This information should suﬃce to alert the European con-
sumer and allows him to correct his initial wrongful inferences from the product
name.
The bluntness of the ECJ in Clinique has been severely instead of severally;
criticised more than once. The ECJ therefore mitigated somewhat the eﬀect of its
ruling in subsequent judgments. Thus, in Estée Lauder46 whilst conﬁrming the
standard of the average consumer, the ECJ also held that “in particular, it must
be determined whether social, cultural or linguistic factors may justify the term
‘lifting’, used in connection with a ﬁrming cream, meaning something diﬀerent
to the German consumer as opposed to consumers in other Member States, or
whether the instructions for the use of the product are in themselves suﬃcient
to make it quite clear that its eﬀects are short-lived, thus neutralising any con-
clusion to the contrary that might be derived from the word ‘lifting’”47. However,
the mitigating eﬀect of the reference to particular social, cultural or linguistic
factors was put immediately into perspective by the Court’s consideration that
“at ﬁrst sight, the average consumer – reasonably well informed and reasonably
observant and circumspect – ought not to expect a cream whose name incorpo-
rates the term ‘lifting’ to produce enduring eﬀects”48. The ECJ acted similarly in
the Linhart and Biﬄ49 case where it held that the mere statement ‘dermatologi-
cally tested’ or ‘clinically tested’ appearing on the packaging of soaps and hair
products meant that the product was “well tolerated or at least harmless when
applied to the skin”50.
It follows from the foregoing that the European average consumer is
depicted as someone who is well capable of processing information which is
disclosed in the market. Moreover, the European average consumer has the
duty to take advantage of this information, the release of which is not non-
committal, especially when that information empowers him to correct his
misleading impressions based on the product name or other particulars on the
packaging of the product or in advertising.

According to the German Government the use of the term ‘lifting’ for a ﬁrming cream may
mislead consumers as to the duration of the product’s eﬀects, because it gives purchasers the
impression that use of the product will obtain results which, above all in terms of their lasting
eﬀects, are identical or comparable to surgical lifting.

3 Information Model – Criticism
The ECJ’s preference for the European average consumer as a standard for the
assessment of misleading practices has been criticised in consumer literature
as majoritarianism.51 Some authors advanced that the concept of the conﬁdent
consumer has a very weak and unreliable basis in Community law.52 In
the same vein, it is often objected that although information disclosure can
contribute to the empowerment of consumers, they are often of very little help
to vulnerable consumers when it comes to leading a self-determined life. This
even prompted some scholars to conclude that the European consumer infor-
mation policy leaves out the protection of the really weak, illiterate or poor
consumer.53
Another critique advanced by legal scholars is the lack of a real benchmark
of reasonable consumer expectations. Especially with regard to digital content
the absence of such a benchmark may have adverse eﬀects on the level of pro-
tection of media users.54 According to those scholars “consumer information
can shape the reasonable expectations of consumers, and thereby also the level
of protection consumers can reasonably expect. In this respect, the level of
protection consumers can expect (e.g. according to the rules of fairness of com-
mercial practices or contract terms), depends to a considerable extent on the
extent to which consumers have been informed. Hence, consumer information
may indirectly also serve as an unfair exclusion clause”55.
Also on a more general level, information requirements have been the
subject of substantial criticism, not the least from behavioural economists.56
Without going into too much detail behavioural economists mark as major

Consumers”, J. Consum. Policy 2013, 36:50–51. These scholars argue that instead of leaving the
matter entirely at the discretion of suppliers and relying on consumer information, a certain
minimum standard of usability, safety and consumer friendliness of digital content must be
imposed (p.50).

Trade Practices and Consumer Disinformation

critiques of consumer information policies based on mandated disclosures, the
bounded rationality of consumers,57 the fact that consumers often lack the time
to read information,58 the absence of rules on the presentation of the informa-
tion,59 the length of the information and the comprehensibility of information
for consumers in general60 and for vulnerable consumers in particular.61
The ease with which the European legislator faithful to the European con-
sumer information model continues to adopt mandatory information require-
ments in recent harmonisation measures may be questioned in the light of
aforementioned critiques. In a legislative context that is piling on information
requirements the question arises whether this overload of information does not
bear in itself the risk of misinforming consumers? An interesting question in that
respect is whether the UCPD, which completely harmonises the domain of unfair
(including misleading) commercial practices, can be of help to combat (potential)
disinformation resulting from an overload of information as a misleading com-
mercial practice. This will be examined in the following section.
4 Is the UCPD of Help?
It must be submitted ﬁrst that the scope of the UCPD is broad. It encompasses
market practices that ‘materially distort the economic behaviour of consumers’.
57 Bounded rationality refers to the limitations to the cognitive capacity of consumers to
process information. A paper often referred to in this context is G.A. Miller, “The Magical
Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information”,
The Psychological Review, 1956, Vol. 63, 81–97. See also G. Howells, European consumer law, in
C. Barnard and S. Peers, European Union Law, OUP, 2014, 687.
58 N. Helberger, L. Guibault, M. Loos, Ch. Mak, L. Pessers, “Digital Content Contracts for
Consumers”, J. Consum. Policy 2013, 36:49.
59 It is therefore submitted that consumer information must be framed. See See N. Helberger,
L. Guibault, M. Loos, Ch. Mak, L. Pessers and B. Van der Sloot, Digital Consumers and the Law –
Towards a Cohesive European Framework, Alphen aan den Rijn, Wolters Kluwer, 2013, 68 et seq.
60 In this respect, it is sometimes submitted that there exist a risk that traders cover their
backs by oversupplying consumers with information; see G. Howells, “The potential and limits
of consumer empowerment by information”, Journal of Law and Society, Vol. 32, 2005, 363.

This means: “using a commercial practice to appreciably impair the consumer’s
ability to make an informed decision”. It follows that information is misleading
when it has an adverse eﬀect on the purchase decision of the consumer. As a
consequence, badly drafted information can be misleading, for instance if the
reason for doing so is to hide certain facts or conditions from consumers. If a
commercial practice omits material information that the average consumer
needs, according to the context, to take an informed transactional decision, it
constitutes a misleading omission prohibited under the UCPD.
The broad scope of the UCPD does not at ﬁrst glance exclude the categoriza-
tion of an overload of information as a misleading practice or omission. How-
ever, one should not overlook that the UCPD is designed within the context of
the European information model and ﬁnally interpreted by the ECJ in accor-
dance with the standards set out above. It follows from the information model
that irrelevant information is not as such misleading. Only relevant information
has the potential to negatively impact the purchase decision of the consumer.62
The assumption therefore remains that a suﬃciently informed consumer cannot
be distorted by an overload of information in taking his purchase decision, pro-
vided that the relevant information to his purchase decision is correct. As a
result, the success rate for combatting overloads of information on the basis of
the UCPD will be in the current state of European law fairly limited. And yet,
recent developments in the ECJ’s case law may reveal a changing approach
towards the overload of information and the consumer’s duty to internalize dis-
closed information.
In the recent Teekanne case63 the Court had to interpret the alleged mislead-
ing character of the statements on the packaging of a fruit tea.64 That packaging
comprised a number of elements of various sizes, colour and font, in particular
(i) depictions of raspberries and vanilla ﬂowers, (ii) the indications ‘fruit tea
with natural ﬂavourings’ and ‘fruit tea with natural ﬂavourings – raspberry-
vanilla taste’ and (iii) a seal with the indication ‘only natural ingredients’ inside
62 An interesting parallel may be drawn here with diﬀerent outcomes in information psychology
studies. See for example the handling of environmental claims in greenwashing advertising and
the contribution of Naderer, Schmuck and Matthes to this book.

a golden circle. The question brought before the Court was whether the depic-
tions on the packaging of the fruit tea were of such a nature that they could
mislead consumers with regard to the tea’s content inasmuch as it gives the
impression that it contains raspberry and vanilla-ﬂower or ﬂavourings obtained
from those ingredients, even though such constituents or ﬂavourings are not
present in that tea.
Having regard to the settled case law set out above, one would have
expected the ECJ to rule that the list of ingredients expresses, in a manner free
from doubt, the fact that the ﬂavourings used are not obtained from vanilla and
raspberries but only taste like them, and that correct and complete information
provided by the list of ingredients on packaging constitutes suﬃcient grounds
on which to rule out the existence of any misleading of consumers. As was
indicated above, consumers have the duty to internalize information which is
disclosed to them in the market and on the products. Despite all this the ECJ
however stated: “the list of ingredients, even though correct and comprehensive,
may in some situations not be capable of correcting suﬃciently the (average
reasonably well informed, and reasonably observant and circumspect) con-
sumer’s erroneous or misleading impression concerning the characteristics of
a foodstuﬀthat stems from the other items comprising its labelling” (own
emphasis)65. In doing so, the ECJ for the ﬁrst time recognised in the Teekanne
case that correct and complete information provided by the list of ingredients
on packaging in accordance with the labelling of foodstuﬀs directive may con-
stitute misleading advertising. It follows that the display of the correct and
comprehensive list of ingredients no longer rules out the possibility that the
labelling has the capacity to mislead consumers. That will be the case if some
of the items of which the labelling is composed of are in practice misleading,
erroneous, ambiguous, contradictory or incomprehensible.66. This assessment
must particularly take into account “the words and depictions used as well as
the location, size, colour, font, language, syntax and punctuation of the various
elements on the fruit tea’s packaging”67.
A striking parallel may be drawn with recent developments in case law
relating to unfair contract terms. In the Katalin Sebestyén68 case the ECJ was
asked whether an arbitral clause could be regarded as unfair despite the
fact that the consumer received, before the conclusion of the contract, general
information on the diﬀerences between the arbitration procedure and ordinary

legal proceedings. The ECJ ﬁrst conﬁrmed the fundamental importance of
pre-contractual information for the consumer’s decision to be bound by the
conditions drafted in advance by the seller or supplier.69 But instead of con-
necting immediate consequences for consumers to this voluntary disclosure by
the trader, the ECJ mitigated its impact on consumers, pointing out that “even
assuming that the general information the consumer receives before concluding
a contract satisﬁes the requirement under Article 5 that it be plain and intelligible,
that fact alone cannot rule out the unfairness of a clause such as that at issue in
the main proceedings” (own emphasis)70.
These developments with respect to labelling requirements and unfair contract
terms demonstrate that the ECJ, unlike the European legislature, is increasingly
aware of the ﬂaws of the European information model. In both domains the ECJ
seems to be prepared to mitigate the harsh consequences of the information
model. It thereto reduces the consumer’s responsibility to process information
and his duty to internalize mandated or voluntary disclosures when taking
purchase decisions.
5 Conclusion
The legislation and jurisprudence relating to misleading practices is still heavily
rooted in the European information model. The average rational consumer has a
duty to internalize mandated or voluntary disclosures. Recent developments in
case law demonstrate that the ECJ is prepared to mitigate this duty in respect
of contract terms and foodstuﬀlabelling. It remains to be seen whether this
development will have a spill-over eﬀect in the context of misleading com-
mercial practices. If so, it would certainly oﬀer judges additional tools to combat
existing overloads of information in e-commerce or beyond. Yet, the European
legislator seems far better placed to deal with the drawbacks of the informa-
tion model and should approach valuable insights from other disciplines, e.g.
behavioural economics, communication studies, information psychology, with
an open mind. It will require a substantial mindshift in current legal thinking,
away from the beaten path of the existing legal assumptions. Such a shift will
obviously take time, but the recent case law may well usher in a new era.

2.3 Greenwashing: Disinformation through
Green Advertising
Abstract: As environmental issues are of growing importance in today’s society,
consumers are more likely to take environmental concerns into consideration
when making their purchase decisions. As a consequence, companies tend to
advertise their products as sustainable or eco-conscious. While many green
advertisements communicate sincere green claims, some companies use adver-
tisements as a tool to overstate or even falsify the minimization of the environ-
mental impact of their oﬀerings. This advertising practice is called greenwashing.
This practice involves spreading disinformation concerning the services or
products in question by telling outright lies or by insinuating environmental
attributes through vague statements or emotional cues. In the following chapter
the various types of greenwashing, its eﬀect on consumers, and future research
perspectives will be discussed.
1 Introduction
Environmental concerns are of growing importance for consumers when making
their purchase decisions. Consequently, companies have been pushed to
develop so called green messages about their oﬀerings that underline their
environmental eﬀorts (Ahern et al. 2013; Baum 2012; Carlson et al. 1996; Parguel
et al. 2015; Segev et al. 2016), for instance, claiming sustainability or recyclability
of their products. More speciﬁcally, companies use advertising to promote
their pro-environmental images and environmentally friendly product attributes
(Leonidou et al. 2011). Thus, the number of companies advertising the green
attributes of their products or services is rising (Ahern et al. 2013; Futerra 2008).
Accordingly, there is a growing need to address the topic of green advertising
in academic research (Taylor 2015). In this chapter we use the term green
advertisements to describe all commercial messages that promote environmental
sustainability or convey ecological messages that target the needs of eco-
conscious customers, regulators, and other stakeholders (Leonidou et al. 2011).
While many green advertisements communicate sincere eﬀorts towards
sustainability and eco-consciousness, some companies use advertisements as a
tool to overstate or even falsify the minimization of the environmental impact of
their oﬀerings (Carlson et al. 1993). In the early stages of green advertising in

particular, companies published advertisements presenting deceptive or confus-
ing truths or even false promises (Davis 1991). Since environmentally friendly
products are increasingly demanded by consumers nowadays, the practice of
untruthful and confusing green advertisements is again on the rise (Baum
2012). This practice of misleading consumers through unsubstantial, false or
vague sustainability claims is called greenwashing (Baum 2012; Carlson et al.
1993; Kangun et al. 1991; Furlow 2010; TerraChoice 2010). The dissemination of
disinformation is a common practice in various kinds of advertising messages
(e.g. nutritional claims such as “fat free”) and is used to make products or
services seem more appealing to consumers (Hickman et al. 1993). However, the
impact of disinformation in green advertising is considered a crucial topic on a
societal level. Therefore, greenwashing can be considered as a speciﬁc type of
disinformation in advertising. Advertising is proclaimed to have the power to
aﬀect social change. As the urge to buy eco-conscious sustainable products is
partly based on the current ecological crisis, disseminating false or inaccurate
information about green products, or trying to persuade consumers on the basis
of non-factual emotional appeals, diminishes the power of advertising to
mitigate this crisis (Kilbourne 1995). Hence, disinformation in green advertising
is aﬀecting the way we deal with a global problem.
The goal of this chapter is to describe the phenomena of greenwashing as
an advertising practice of disinformation. For this purpose, this chapter presents
research on the content of greenwashing and discusses the possible eﬀects
of greenwashing on consumers’ attitudes and behavior. In summarizing our
ﬁndings, we propose some ideas for possible future research and an outline for
consumer advocacy groups and policy makers, advertising practitioners, and
consumers.
2 Greenwashing as Disinformation through
Green Advertising
Due to the growing popularity of being eco-conscious, environmental claims are
nowadays used for all kinds of products and services, including those oﬀerings
that are not inherently environmentally friendly such as airlines, plastic bottles,
or batteries. Moreover, many green advertising messages present confusing truths
or false promises that lack substantive information about the real environmental
impact of products and services (Baum 2012). The phenomenon of greenwashing
(Carlson et al. 1993; Delmas, Cuerel Burbano 2011; Kangun et al. 1991; Parguel
et al. 2015) thus refers to “the act of misleading consumers regarding the
106
Brigitte Naderer, Desirée Schmuck and Jörg Matthes

environmental practices of a company or the environmental beneﬁts of a product
or service” (TerraChoice 2010, p. 1). Baum (2012) deﬁnes greenwashing more pre-
cisely as “the act of disseminating disinformation (false information to obscure
the truth) to consumers regarding the environmental practices of a company or
the environmental beneﬁts of a product or service” (2012, p. 425).
The term greenwashing is not new, but was ﬁrst established in the early
1990s to describe trivial, misleading or deceptive claims in green advertising
(Carlson et al. 1993; Kangun et al. 1991). Since then, many companies have
made sincere eﬀorts to reduce the environmental impact of their products. Never-
theless, there are those who overstate or simply fabricate the ecological qualities
of their oﬀerings. Consequently, “environmentally friendly”, “degradable”, or
“sustainable” are abstract catchphrases that are currently used frequently in
green advertising. Four main factors are driving the importance of greenwashing
practices in green marketing today. First, consumers have an increased demand
for environmentally friendly products. Second, sales of green products are
rising. Third, government regulations are supporting environmental objectives.
Fourth, there are no international industry-wide laws regulating green promo-
tion (Horiuchi et al. 2009), however, the EU directive 84/450/EEC states regula-
tions concerning misleading advertising for the members of the European Union
(for more details see Straetmans’ chapter in this book). Thus corporations have
increased the number of green products and advertisements in recent years,
making disinformation through green advertising an important issue in today’s
advertising practices.
The misleading presentation of ecologically relevant attributes is a worrying
practice: positive information about green products is often presented in a way
that is deceptive and consequently individuals who lack background infor-
mation about a company’s activities may misinterpret the advertised product’s
characteristics or the company’s environmental intentions (Lyon, Maxwell 2011).
Furthermore, the usage of terms such as “environmentally friendly”, or “sustain-
able” is often hard to verify by consumers even if they have used the product
or service (Carlson et al. 1993). Vague claims, emotional cues or fabricated
promises, are not unique for green advertising. However, the dissemination of
misleading information about ecological issues may aﬀect the way in which the
global problem of the environmental crisis is dealt with (Kilbourne 1995). It is
considered especially problematic as companies receive governmental supports
(Horiuchi et al. 2009) and obvious greenwashing has a negative eﬀect on con-
sumers’ trust (Finisterra do Paço, Reis 2012; Tucker et al. 2012). This outcome
could have a negative impact on the purchase intentions of legitimate green
products, consequently damaging a crucial aspect of dealing with the environ-
mental crisis (Kilbourne 1995).
Greenwashing: Disinformation through Green Advertising
107

When it comes to practices of greenwashing, researchers therefore investi-
gate 1) what techniques companies use to mislead consumers (Baum 2012;
Carlson et al. 1993; Kangun et al. 1991; Segev et al. 2016), and 2) how consumers’
evaluations of and reactions in response to green advertising is undermined by
dishonest or overstated green advertisements (Chen, Chang 2013; Chen et al.
2014; Schmuck et al. 2016a; Parguel et al. 2015).
3 Content of Greenwashing Practices
When promoting products or services as environmentally friendly, companies
aim at informing consumers about the green attributes of their oﬀerings, generat-
ing awareness for the sustainability eﬀorts, and creating demand for environmen-
tally friendly products or services (Segev et al. 2016). Companies have diﬀerent
ways of presenting attributes of products and services as sustainable: 1) They can
promote a green lifestyle; 2) they can address the connection to the biophysical
environment; or 3) they can promote a corporate image of environmental respon-
sibility (Banerjee et al. 1995).
To convey these messages, green advertising can employ one of three
strategies: green advertisements either present functional, fact-based appeals
which highlight the relevant utilitarian attributes of a product compared to
conventional competing products (Hartmann et al. 2005). Alternatively, they
use image-based emotional appeals depicting pleasant natural scenery, which
might evoke positive aﬀective responses because of the virtual association with
real-world nature (Hartmann et al. 2013). Finally, green advertisements can
employ a mixed-type promotional strategy combining functional and emotional
appeals.
The majority of green advertisements in the past thirty years were issued by
companies in contrast to associations or advocacy groups, and the content of
these advertisements has shifted from focusing on the environmental aspects of
products and services to promoting green oﬀerings as a consumer beneﬁt (Ahern
et al. 2013). Accordingly, the goal of green advertising nowadays is primarily to
make the consumers feel good about themselves when choosing a green product
or service, which leads advertisements to a low level of factual green claims
(Segev et al. 2016) and – as also apparent in other types of advertising – an
increase in emotional appeals.
3.1 Greenwashing Based on Claims
In their content analysis, Kangun and colleagues (1991) established a typology
that distinguishes four major types of greenwashing claims: 1) false claims that
108
Brigitte Naderer, Desirée Schmuck and Jörg Matthes

present a straight out lie; 2) vague or ambiguous claims oﬀering a broad and
poorly deﬁned claim leaving room for misinterpretation, e.g. “all natural”; 3)
claims that omit important information, which advertise a narrow set of green
attributes, while ignoring other aspects of equally important environmental con-
cerns and 4) a combination of misleading elements.
TerraChoice (2010) has built on these types of claims and has established
four additional concepts: 1) unfounded claims, which present an unsubstantial
claim without accessible supporting information or reliable third-party certi-
ﬁcation; 2) presenting false labels, which show images and logos that give a
wrongful impression of a third-party endorsement; 3) claims of irrelevance,
which advertise a truthful environmental claim that is unimportant or un-
helpful, e.g. claiming products are CFC-free (chloroﬂuorocarbon-free), when
CFC is generally banned by law; 4) claims promoting the lesser of two evils,
which oﬀer information that may be true but that distracts the consumer from
the greater environmental impact of the category as a whole, e.g. a fuel-eﬃcient
sports car.
Content analyses showed that particularly in the 1990s, which constitutes
the beginnings of green advertising, more than half of the green advertisements
investigated contained deceptive claims, most of them vague or ambiguous in
nature (Carlson et al. 1993; Kangun et al. 1991; Leonidou et al. 2011). However,
recent evidence reveals that disinformation through green advertising is still an
issue: Baum (2012) studied six of the previously deﬁned concepts of greenwash-
ing in a content analysis of green print advertisements in the US and the UK
in 2008. The majority of the advertisements researched presented at least one
misleading or deceptive claim (75% US; 51.6% UK). The most frequently applied
type of greenwashing was the presentation of ambiguous or vague claims (51.7%),
followed by claims that omit important information (34.4%) and unfounded
claims (30%). The high levels of vague and unsubstantiated claims have been
shown to be an international issue, as content analyses in India (Fernando et al.
2014) and China (Dai et al. 2014) have found that a third of print advertisements
present ambiguous and unfounded statements.
However, another recent analysis (Segev et al. 2016) of print advertisements
showed that more than half of all green advertisements (62.3%) can be charac-
terized as credible. This is of course good news, yet 25.1% were still coded as
vague or ambiguous, and 11.7% were regarded as incomplete statements. The
researchers also looked into the usage of environmental logos, which give the
consumers the impression of a third-party endorsement of the presented product
or service, and can be regarded as an important and easily understandable
source of information for consumers. In total, 15% of the 617 advertisements
analyzed presented a logo, of which 67.7% were illegitimate (Segev et al. 2016).

109

Hence greenwashing is not only a technique that works with explicit claims, but
also includes a more emotional or intuitive aspect by the use of logos or speciﬁc
images (Parguel et al. 2015).
3.2 Executional Greenwashing
In fact, visual demonstrations of pleasing nature imagery are frequently used
in green advertising (Hartmann, Apaolaza-Ibáñez 2008; Matthes et al. 2014;
Hartmann, Apaolaza-Ibáñez 2009). For example, Segev and colleagues (2016)
showed that 37.6% of all advertisements presented elements of vegetation, and
13.9% showed images of landscapes and animals. Hartmann and Apaolaza-
Ibáñez (2009) also state that ecological attributes of a product or brand are often
communicated in the background of an advertisement which presents a beautiful
unspoiled landscape. Previous research has shown that natural imagery in green
advertisements can evoke positive emotional responses in consumers (Hartmann,
Apaolaza-Ibáñez 2008, 2009, 2012; Matthes et al. 2014), which can lead to higher
advertisement and brand evaluations (Matthes et al. 2014).
Consequently, Parguel and colleagues (2015) introduced another dimension
of disinformation though green advertising that expands its deﬁnition beyond
the use of textual claims. They use the term of executional greenwashing to
deﬁne the practice of presenting so-called, nature-evoking elements in association
with a product that is not factually eco-conscious (2015, p. 108). They conclude
that the usage of such pleasant nature imagery may be misused in green adver-
tising to induce false perceptions of a company’s environmental eﬀorts without
referring to its actual sustainable product or service features. Therefore, in the
case of executional greenwashing, nature-evoking images are paired with trivial
green buzzwords such as “natural” or claims such as “go green” to evoke the
feeling of a product being environmentally friendly without factual basis, hence
creating disinformation about a product or service. However, content analyses,
which speciﬁcally focus on the use of images in green advertisements are still
lacking. Baum (2012) states that image interpretations in quantitative content
analysis are much more subjective and require a higher level of interpretation.
Still, including background imagery or icons into the analysis makes it possible
to conduct a more nuanced interpretation of the advertisement, which is why
the coding of visuals in future content analyses is warranted.
Additionally, Baum (2012) points out that it is not equally possible to examine
the diﬀerent types of greenwashing claims. In her analysis, identifying false
claims proved to be unfeasible, as it requires extensive background knowledge
about the service or product promoted, which also describes the challenge con-
sumers face when confronted with claims in advertising. Recent events however,
110
Brigitte Naderer, Desirée Schmuck and Jörg Matthes

such as the Volkswagen scandal in the fall of 2015, show that companies do
commit the practice of lying in their advertisements (Lynes 2015) and it is
therefore necessary to investigate all possible greenwashing strategies.
4 Eﬀects of Disinformation in Environmental
Advertising on Consumers’ Attitudes and
Behavior
Despite the excessive use of greenwashing claims in advertising, there is a dearth
of research investigating the eﬀects of these claims on individuals’ perceptions
of disinformation through green advertising and its consequences on attitudinal
outcomes. The few studies that investigated how consumers perceive misleading
green advertisements used a variety of outcome measures ranging from rather
broad conceptualizations such as green advertising scepticism (Finisterra do
Paço, Reis 2012) or ad credibility (Tucker et al. 2012) to more speciﬁc measures
such as perceived deception (Newell et al. 1998) or perceived greenwashing
(Chen, Chang 2013).
As a key construct in the research area, perceived greenwashing refers to
individuals’ mistrust of green claims in advertising because they are misleading
in terms of words or visuals, are vague or not provable, are exaggerated, or
mask important information (Chen, Chang 2013). First research evidence suggests
that individuals negatively evaluate advertised brands when they mistrust com-
panies’ environmental eﬀorts. Nyilasy, Gangadharbatla, and Paladino (2014)
found that additional information about companies’ environmental eﬀorts in
advertising decreases consumers’ attitudes to advertising and purchase inten-
tions when a company’s actual environmental performance is low. In contrast,
when no additional information about companies’ environmental eﬀorts was
presented, the same advertised product and brand was evaluated favorably.
Hence, the question arises whether consumers are even able to detect deceptive
greenwashing strategies when they are not equipped with detailed background
information about a company’s full portfolio of activities (Lyon, Maxwell 2011).
An experimental study by Newell and colleagues (1998) revealed that false
textual claims in green advertising increased consumers’ perceptions of decep-
tion, which in turn lowered the advertiser’s credibility, advertising and brand
attitudes, and purchase intentions. In contrast, Parguel and colleagues (2015)
found that an executional greenwashing strategy, using nature-evoking images
in advertising, was not deemed as misleading among consumers, but even
enhanced their perceptions of the advertised brand’s ecological image and led
Greenwashing: Disinformation through Green Advertising
111

to more favourable brand attitudes than the same advertisement without natural
imagery (2015). The greenwashing strategy was only unmasked when additional
information about the brand’s actual environmental performance was provided
by adding a traﬃc light label.
This ﬁnding is striking because it suggests that the simple presence of a
nature-evoking image may lead to more positive attitudinal outcomes among
consumers than an advertisement without visual cues for the very same product.
Hence, although consumers might be able to detect false textual claims as
greenwashing (1998), they may still be susceptible to the greenwashing strategies
of advertisers that enhance a brand’s ecological image merely by adding nature-
evoking images in advertisements (2015).
However, as in other ﬁelds of advertising, consumers’ involvement with the
issues relating to the advertisement has to be taken into account to entirely
understand consumers’ responses to an advertising message (Parguel et al.
2015). In the realm of green advertising, a lion’s share of research suggests that
individuals diﬀer in how they respond to persuasive appeals depending on their
level of environmental involvement. Involvement refers to the degree to which an
individual perceives an attitude object as personally relevant or salient (Petty,
Cacioppo 1986). Extensive literature provides a variety of conceptualizations for
environmental involvement (for a discussion, see Matthes et al. 2014). One con-
ceptualization is environmental concern, which can be described as awareness
of environmental problems and perception of the necessity to protect the envi-
ronment (e.g., Finisterra do Paço, Reis 2012; Bickart, Ruth 2012; Hartmann,
Apaolaza-Ibáñez 2012; Schmuck et al. 2016b; Schmuck et al. 2016a). Second,
scholars have conceptualized green involvement as a general positive attitude
toward green products (e.g., Bech-Larsen 1996; Roberts 1996). A third deﬁnition
of highly involved green consumers relies on their self-reported green purchase
behavior (e.g., Chang 2011; Shrum et al. 1995). Finally, consumers’ objective
knowledge or expertise about environmental issues serves as an important
indicator for their involvement with the environment (Schmuck et al. 2016a;
Parguel et al. 2015).
Highly involved green consumers have long been considered as particularly
skeptical (Finisterra do Paço, Reis 2012; Shrum et al. 1995). It has been assumed
that environmentally involved consumers may be more inclined to penalize
products or brands that make poor environmental eﬀorts and may be more likely
to critically examine an advertisement (Newell et al. 1998). However, recent ﬁnd-
ings reveal that vague claims such as images of nature in advertising are not
detected by highly involved consumers and thus question the widely believed
notion of the skeptical green consumer (Matthes, Wonneberger 2014; Schmuck
112
Brigitte Naderer, Desirée Schmuck and Jörg Matthes

et al. 2016b). Matthes and colleagues (2014) found that highly involved con-
sumers evaluated an argument-based functional appeal more positively compared
to those with lower involvement. However, vague image-based advertisements
that presented no substantial information about the environmental features of
a product also exerted a positive eﬀect on consumers’ advertisement and brand
attitudes irrespective of their involvement level (Matthes et al. 2014). Thus the
mere association of a brand with textual or visual green claims led to more
favorable brand associations among highly involved individuals, no matter
whether the advertisement presented objective factual information about the
brand’s greenness or contained solely visual green cues.
In the speciﬁc context of disinformation through green advertising, research
on the moderating role of environmental involvement is scarce. There is ﬁrst
evidence that neither high environmental concern (Newell et al. 1998) nor high
knowledge about environmental issues (Parguel et al. 2015) can facilitate the
recognition of vague misleading green advertising cues and thus prevent con-
sumers from falling into the greenwashing-trap. Parguel and colleagues (2015)
found that simple nature-evoking images enhanced a brand’s ecological image
among consumers with low environmental knowledge but also among those
with high expertise, although to a lesser degree. This eﬀect was reduced how-
ever, when indicators of a product’s environmental performance such as eco
labels were added. In this case, environmentally misleading, deceptive, or false
claims in advertising may severely damage consumers’ advertiser and brand
evaluations.
A recent study by Schmuck, Matthes and Naderer (2016a) took a closer look
at the eﬀects of diﬀerent types of greenwashing claims on perceived deception
among consumers depending on their environmental concern or knowledge.Within
an experiment employing a quota sample of 486 US consumers, the authors
examined the eﬀects of two diﬀerent types of greenwashing claims for a bottled
mineral water: a vague or ambiguous claim that was too broad to have a clear
meaning and a false fabricated claim that presented an outright lie about
the product’s environmental features. Additionally, they investigated how the
association of these two claim types with a nature-evoking image aﬀected con-
sumers’ perceived deception, namely their perceived greenwashing. Findings
reveal that consumers did not recognize vague greenwashing advertisements,
irrespective of their level of environmental concern or knowledge. Instead, vague
claims can even promote brand attitudes when they are combined with pleasing
nature imagery. The reason for this positive eﬀect is an aﬀective process evoked
by the picture that appeals directly to the consumers’ emotions. In line with
previous studies (Hartmann, Apaolaza-Ibáñez 2008, 2009, 2012; Schmuck et al.
2016b), they found that beautiful nature imagery activated feelings compared to
Greenwashing: Disinformation through Green Advertising
113

those experienced in real nature, so-called virtual nature experiences (Hartmann,
Apaolaza-Ibáñez 2008, p. 821). Thus, consumers do not recognize disinformation
in green advertising through vague ambiguous claims. Instead these claims even
exert a positive eﬀect on consumers’ attitudinal outcomes.
Against the background of previous research evidence indicating that most
greenwashed advertisements employ vague claims (Baum 2012; Fernando et al.
2014; Kangun et al. 1991), this result seems worrying. However, vague claims in
combination with emotive imagery are not limited to green advertising, but form
a common advertising strategy in almost all ﬁelds of advertising. In particular,
when advertising objects arouse or elicit strong feelings such as in the realm
of healthcare, political issues or advertising with children, emotive advertising
appeals can lead to poorly reasoned attitudes, which points to the severe con-
sequences of disinformation through vague emotive claims in advertising in
general (see also Huddy, Gunnthorsdottir 2000).
Although less prevalent than vague claims, false green claims that present
an outright lie may also bias consumers’ evaluations of an attitude object.
Schmuck, Matthes and Naderer (2016a) investigated the eﬀects of these fabricated
green claims on consumers’ perceived deception depending on their environ-
mental knowledge. They found that those with higher environmental expertise
detected the advertisement’s misleading intention when false textual claims
were presented. Less knowledgeable individuals did not react negatively in
response to the advertisement, presumably because of a less critical elaboration
of the presented claims. However, when a nature-evoking image was added to a
false claim, highly knowledgeable individuals fell victim to the emotional virtual
nature experience – as in response to the vague claim – and did not unmask
the advertisement’s outright lie. Hence, those who detected greenwashing most
easily when the false claim was presented without a natural image recognized
disinformation through greenwashing to a lesser degree when the advertisement
contained a nature-evoking image. Thus, the positive emotions induced among
those with higher environmental involvement inhibit critical perceptions of the
advertisement’s content. Put diﬀerently, the aﬀective process can override the
critical elaboration, and highly knowledgeable individuals see less green-
washing in those advertisements compared to advertisements without beautiful
nature imagery. Thus, this evidence suggests that highly involved individuals are
particularly susceptible to disinformation in advertising through emotive appeals
(e.g., pleasant imagery), which chimes with previous ﬁndings indicating that
people who are highly involved with an issue are particularly susceptible to
involve emotions in their reasoning (Huddy, Gunnthorsdottir 2000). Hence,
when attitudes are emotion-laden such as in the realm of environmental protec-
tion, health campaigns or political advertising, emotional cues may be particularly
114
Brigitte Naderer, Desirée Schmuck and Jörg Matthes

persuasive for those highly involved with the issue, because they weigh aﬀective
information more heavily than do the less involved.
In contrast, emotive images are less persuasive for less involved individuals.
Schmuck’s and colleagues’ (2016a) ﬁndings revealed that individuals with lower
environmental knowledge were able to recognize the advertisement’s green-
washing intention when an additional image was present presumably because
the nature imagery is less persuasive for these individuals. Instead, the image
draws greater attention to the obvious contrast between the false claim and the
pleasing imagery and thus facilitates unmasking the misinforming claim among
those with less environmental knowledge (Hartmann et al. 2013). Consequently, for
these consumers the cognitive process was stronger than the aﬀective process
because of their lower emotional aﬃnity towards nature. Thus, depending on
consumers’ environmental knowledge and the presence of a visual cue in the
advertisement, false claims might enhance perceived greenwashing, while vague
claims were not recognized as greenwashing at all. In contrast to environmental
knowledge, environmental concern did not enable consumers to notice green-
washing, either through vague or false claims. This ﬁnding corroborates with
previous research (Newell et al. 1998), indicating that being worried or concerned
about the environment is not suﬃcient to detect an advertisements’ misleading
intention. Rather than environmental concern, objective topic knowledge of
for example, recycling, packaging, or pollution, is necessary to recognize false
claims.
In sum, research so far has shown that vague green advertising claims
are not perceived as greenwashing among consumers and may even positively
inﬂuence brand attitudes and purchase intentions, especially when the adver-
tisement contains pleasing images of nature (Matthes et al. 2014; Schmuck et al.
2016a). However, when companies go too far and employ outright lies in adver-
tisements (e.g., claiming that a plastic bottle is the most environmentally friendly
product in the world), consumers might detect the advertisement’s misleading
intention depending on their expertise and the visual layout of the advertisement.
If consumers discover greenwashing, this can backﬁre on the product and
corporate brand evaluations (Nyilasy et al. 2014). Thus, advertisers should
follow a responsible approach when employing green marketing strategies, since
any perception of deception on the part of consumers may result in negative
attitudes toward the advertisement, the brand and the advertiser (Newell et al.
1998).
Overall, research on the eﬀects of misleading green advertising is still
scarce. Only a few studies have examined the eﬀects of disinformation through
green advertising. Future research should follow up on their ﬁndings and
examine the eﬀects of misleading green advertisements for diﬀerent product
Greenwashing: Disinformation through Green Advertising
115

categories and brands. Furthermore, the present eﬀect studies have not suﬃ-
ciently researched all the existing types of greenwashing. More studies that
investigate the eﬀects of executional greenwashing, the usage of illegitimate
third-party endorsement and the various greenwashing claims are needed.
Moreover, there is a dearth of research on the long-term eﬀects of greenwashed
advertising. Finally, up until now, many studies investigating greenwashing
eﬀects (e.g., Newell et al. 1998; Nyilasy et al. 2014) employed student samples,
which cannot be generalized to a broader population of green consumers. There-
fore, to fully understand the eﬀects of disinformation in terms of greenwashing
in environmental advertising, more experimental research with non-student
samples is warranted.
5 Conclusion
The existing body of research shows that consumers are aﬀected by the use
of misleading environmental claims in their attitudes and behavior. However,
studies also reveal that diﬀerent types of greenwashing are more diﬃcult to
identify than others, even for highly involved and informed consumers (Schmuck
et al. 2016a). Previous research even suggests that more involved individuals are
most inﬂuenced by emotive appeals such as nature imagery (Schmuck et al.
2016b; Huddy, Gunnthorsdottir 2000). As vague claims and appealing nature
imagery are commonly used tools in today’s green marketing campaigns (Baum
2012; Segev et al. 2016), it is a worrying result that consumers cannot recognize
these misleading intentions. More research investigating the potential of execu-
tive greenwashing through the usage of nature imagery and possible counter
mechanisms is therefore warranted.
Segev and colleagues’ (2016) content analysis has shown that advertise-
ments presenting environmental facts are less disposed to deceive consumers.
Hence, it is recommendable to increase the usage of factual claims to ensure
the avoidance of misinforming consumers. As vague and ambiguous claims
still dominate greenwashing practices in environmental advertising (Segev et al.
2016; Baum 2012; Fernando et al. 2014; Carlson et al. 1993; Kangun et al. 1991;
Leonidou et al. 2011), it is clear that disinformation is a crucial part of green
advertising. Yet in the interest of consumer information, advertisers should sub-
stantiate their claims by presenting more details on the green product or service.
However, given the ﬁnding that emotional appeals such as nature imagery
are very successful in persuading consumers (Huddy, Gunnthorsdottir 2000;
Schmuck et al. 2016b), the incentives for advertisers to change their advertising
strategies is low.

As a regulatory attempt, it is our suggestion to provide consumers with more
detailed information about a company’s actual eﬀorts to preserve nature. As
an example, Parguel and colleagues (2015) discuss the suggestion of adding a
traﬃc light label in the advertisement to give information on the environmental
impact of the advertised product or service. Additionally, the usage of approved
and oﬃcial eco-labels would help consumers to understand the ecological con-
tributions more intuitively (Bickart, Ruth 2012). As emotional appeals in green
advertising are able to reach consumers on an intuitive level, we would suggest
that regulatory information should work similarly. Hence obligatory labels or
signiﬁers like the traﬃc light added by third-party experts could help consumers
to better understand the true environmental impact of the advertised product or
service. It is, however, an important directive for future research to investigate the
issues of regulatory attempts further so as to receive insight into the best ways of
informing consumers about the actual environmental eﬀorts of a company.
Segev and colleagues (2016) suggest that it would be recommendable to not
only address the regulations of claims in green advertising, but also the usage of
visual elements such as pictures or logos of environmental organizations. The
presentation of non-certiﬁed graphical elements might mislead consumers to
see it as a validation of a green claim. As visual elements are highly eﬀective in
convincing consumers (Hartmann, Apaolaza-Ibáñez 2008, 2009; Matthes et al.
2014) even if the presented claims are false or vague (Schmuck et al. 2016a), we
would argue that binding and precise regulations are necessary. Though to
establish international binding regulations proves to be challenging in practice
(see Straetmans’ chapter in this book).
We would also suggest that it is of key importance to increase consumers’
awareness for misleading advertising practices such as greenwashing, hence
developing consumer literacy programs that are part of school education (for
more information on advertising critique and consumer advocacy groups see
Förster’s chapter in this book). Furthermore, it is helpful to promote informa-
tional online guides such as TerraChoice’s (2010) site “Seven sins of greenwash-
ing”. Here, consumers can learn about the diﬀerent techniques of greenwashing
and to recognize the “greenwashing-sins” through an online-game. Initiatives
like this may help consumers to identify precise and reliable green advertising
which could minimize their susceptibility to disinformation through green adver-
tisements. Applications such as this might also be helpful to create a general
awareness of disinformation practices used in advertising.
The increased demand for green products nowadays is a positive develop-
ment, which can be of importance to managing environmental issues such as
air pollution or waste disposal. However, if companies continue to misuse the
Greenwashing: Disinformation through Green Advertising
117

consumers’ desire for eco-conscious products and services by disseminating dis-
information about their oﬀerings, environmental responsible products in general
might lose their prominence and trust in the marketplace. It is thus of impor-
tance that stricter advertising regulations and transparent information practices
are implemented to stop greenwashing.

2.4 The Rise of Brand Journalism
Abstract: There are few commercial communication concepts that have had a
rise as spectacular and fast as brand journalism. Brands’ journalistic activities
were usually considered under the category of content marketing and are also
sometimes described using terms such as custom content, content publishing
or corporate journalism. Although corporate journalism is an old practice, its
development in digital environments has elevated it to a new dimension. Today,
as a matter of fact, there are few large corporations or brands that resist the urge
to start initiatives in the ﬁeld: brand journalism seems like a modern marketing
imperative.
This chapter tries to clarify the conceptual nature of brand journalism, given
its growing importance. First, it explains the diﬀerent factors that contributed
to its rise. Then it analyzes its various forms along with some keys to its use
by corporations. Finally, the eﬀects of brand journalism in terms of audience
engagement, and its contribution to the tension between information and mis-
information in markets, are evaluated and future developments assessed.
There are few commercial communication concepts that have risen as spectacu-
larly and fast as brand journalism. Brands’ journalistic activities are usually con-
sidered under the umbrella concept of content marketing – “the idea that all
brands, in order to attract and retain customers, need to think and act like
media companies” (Pulizzi 2012, p. 116) or like publishers (Rogers 2016) –, and
are also sometimes described in terms like custom content, content publishing
or corporate journalism. Since 2004, when Larry Light, then McDonald’s CMO,
coined the term, these activities have multiplied (Bull 2013). Although corporate
journalism is an old practice – publications such as The Furrow or The Ford
Times are often mentioned as relevant precedents1 – its development in digital
environments has elevated it to a new dimension (see, among others, Barrett
2012; D’Vorkin 2014; Kent 2012; Mallet et al. 2013; Salerno 2013; Malthouse
2014). Today, as a matter of fact, there are few large corporations or brands that
resist the urge to start new initiatives in the ﬁeld. As Light (2014b) says, “brand
journalism is a modern marketing imperative”.

joined many other long-running company magazines introduced since the mid-1800s (Riley
1992; Swenson 2012).

Besides McDonald’s pioneering activities, there are currently a good number
of brand journalism initiatives that show enough know-how and experience to
be considered models of good practice. Red Bull has created an entire media
division following the logic of brand journalism; Coca-Cola’s Journey is an online
magazine that gives access to the brand’s world in the online universe; there
are also specialized media like Adobe’s CMO, Credit Suisse’s The Financialist or
General Electric’s GE Reports. As with content marketing in general, there seems
to be no limit to the variety of brand journalism’s forms (see, among others,
Brito 2012; Brown 2014; Lazauskas 2014b; Leitus 2014; Mann 2014; Sinclair 2014;
Shapiro 2014; Holt 2016). By 2013, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) under-
lined in a very diverse sample of more than ﬁfty U.S. companies that 86% of
business-to-consumer and 93% of business-to-business ﬁrms were developing
content marketing activities of some kind (Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB)
2013).
This chapter, in considering the relevance that brand journalism has achieved,
tries to make its nature clearer from a conceptual standpoint. The various factors
that contributed to its development are later explained. Its various forms are
then analyzed along with some indications of its use by corporations. Finally,
the eﬀects of brand journalism will be evaluated and we will share our thoughts
concerning the future development of this activity.
1 Brand Journalism: Concept and Nature
A clear consensus on the deﬁnition of brand journalism has not yet been
reached. However, there is a broad consensus on the activities that can be
described as such. Although sometimes there can be a degree of confusion with
other forms of content marketing – especially with native advertising actions –
what deﬁnes brand journalism is the management and design of brand con-
tents from a journalistic perspective, imitating the best practices of the news
media.
Andy Bull, who wrote one of the ﬁrst handbooks on the topic, emphasized
that brand journalism is a response to the fact that any organization can now
use journalistic techniques to tell its story directly to the public (Bull 2013).
Larry Light, the term’s “father”, points out the fact that brand journalism is
about communicating a multi-dimensional, multi-faceted, complex set of brand
messages in an integrated manner. There is an editorial policy, a brand frame-
work of brand-deﬁning “non-negotiables” within which marketing teams have
the responsibility to be locally relevant, and the ﬂexibility to address individual
diﬀerences (Light 2014a). Like regular journalism, he comments, brand journalism’s
122
Ángel Arrese and Francisco J. Pérez-Latre

goal is to inform, entertain and persuade by collecting and communicating
news, events and happenings (Light, cited in Swenson 2012). D’Vorkin, a prac-
titioner who from his management position in Forbes magazine has often
advocated the development of content marketing activities, conceives brand
journalism as “brands using the tools of digital publishing and social media to
speak directly to consumers” (D’Vorkin 2012, p. 10).
A good number of communication consultants and content companies have
developed brand journalism units that are specially committed to a speciﬁc way
of understanding the initiative. For Dawson Ferguson (2012), for example, brand
journalism is “using the credibility and inﬂuence of news to tell a corporate
story in order to achieve competitive diﬀerentiation” (2012, p. 1); for Media-
Source (2013) “brand journalism utilizes journalistic techniques to tell a story
created for targeted audiences. The less branding applied to the content, the
more the content ﬁts the criteria for strong brand journalism” (2013, p. 5); Lewis
PR (2014) describes it like this: “It’s a company investing in content and becom-
ing a provider of news. It is more, much more, than a series of press releases
and product launches. Brand journalism is a serious attempt to share infor-
mation and comment about an industry or sector” (2014, p. 7). Finally, for the
Spanish communication consultants Llorente and Cuenca, “brand journalism
uses the news’ credibility and inﬂuence (and its format) so that brands and
corporations diﬀerentiate its oﬀer in the market. With brand journalism, brands
are introduced into the lives of potential audiences with issues that are familiar
to them: they aspire to be the newspaper, TV channel, website or radio station
that their clients follow” (Tascón, Pino 2014, p. 10).
The use of tools, techniques and journalistic formats for contents produced
for media owned by brands or corporations seem to be essential notes of brand
journalism. Besides the technical dimension, brand journalism – equal in this
sense to corporate journalism – applies “traditional journalistic principles to
organizational communication, in order to achieve alignment and action behind
the organization’s purpose, vision, values, strategies, operating principles, and
priorities” (Kounalakis et al. 1999, p. 230). It also has a common goal of achieving
credibility, inﬂuence and positive engagement by participation in the ﬂow of
information and mediated social conversations, especially in digital environ-
ments, with contents that are clearly diﬀerentiated from advertising contents,
PR, or those of content marketing. The nature of the kind of activity that is
developed is more controversial.
In general, the idea that those activities can really be considered to be
journalism has not been easily accepted, especially among journalists them-
selves. Along these lines, Ken Doctor, a media market analyst and commentator
says bluntly: “Call it what you want, but brand journalism isn’t journalism. It’s
The Rise of Brand Journalism
123

public relations, customer connection, engagement – whatever you want to call
it – on the new steroidal Intel chips. And it can produce good stuﬀthat’s useful
to us as buyers of goods and services. But it’s not journalism” (Doctor 2007).
This type of distinction is usual when brand journalism is analyzed as a
phenomenon, even when there is a recognition of the diﬃculties in deﬁning
the nature of diﬀerent communication activities – even those of the news media
themselves – (Barciela 2013; Edgecliﬀe-Johnson 2014; Farhi 2013; Filloux 2014;
Llyod 2015; Meleard 2015; Meyer 2014; Ostrikoﬀ2013). Some specialists in
marketing contents have elaborated on the true nature of these activities; Con-
tently for example, a New York ﬁrm specializing in the management of content
produced for freelancers to serve brands (Carr 2013, pp. B1) distinguishes brand
journalism – “A mythical discipline that cannot and should not exist within
the space-time continuum of our media universe. While brand publishing pro-
vides information and entertainment and should hold itself to a standard of
ethics, journalism must be independent” – from brand publishing – “The
practice of a brand telling stories about the things it cares about, its brand, and
its brand’s products in a way that’s genuinely engaging and not promotional)”
(Lazauskas 2014a).
The debate about the “journalistic” nature of these brand communication
activities, and about how they are perceived by audiences, could be framed in
the more general discussion about the tensions between information and dis-
information processes that aﬀect the functioning of markets and society. This is
especially relevant given the diﬃculty of measuring newsworthiness and the
credibility of the news and their sources in social media environments, and the
need for authenticity, credibility and transparency of information to ensure that
journalistic ethics are upheld (Hasnat 2014; Karlova, Fisher 2013).
In conclusion, brand journalism can be considered as a series of content
marketing activities produced by brands and corporations that share some
characteristics: content with value, newsworthiness and interest for them and
their audiences; distributed by their own media; and using journalistic work
processes, tools, principles and formats. Their goal is to achieve authority and
inﬂuence in markets and society and to strengthen their relationships with
diﬀerent clients and stakeholders.
The following matrix could serve to visualize and compare diﬀerent modalities
of content marketing (and other activities of brands’ communication mix), along
two main aspects: the emphasis on informative, persuasive or entertainment
formats and genres; and key media strategy for content publishing (paid media,
earned media, owned media). Of course, the line between them is not clear-cut,
and many hybrid formats are possible, but this conceptual matrix can help to

tion activities.

2 The Development of Brand Journalism
As noted before, brand journalism has a number of famous precedents in the
history of corporations, brands, and their communication, from house-organs to
the many initiatives promoted by corporate journalism. However, its new twenty-
ﬁrst century dimension, with its variety of forms, has been a consequence of the
unique set of circumstances that surround brand marketing management and
the development of the world of journalism.
The technological revolution, especially of communication and information
technology, has transformed both marketing and journalism. On one side, from
a marketing standpoint, technologies have made brands and corporations more
visible in the marketplace and transformed their relationships with their clients
and society at large. At the same time, they have had to face new challenges, as
more complex communication environments make relevance and diﬀerentiation
ever more diﬃcult to achieve. On the other hand, technologies have been truly
disruptive for the creation and distribution of journalism, leading to a crisis of
journalistic identity that aﬀects the profession itself, its companies and business
models (Blumler 2010).
The management of brand communication was traditionally supported by
advertising and public relations. Today it requires new tools to balance and
overcome the growing shortcomings of conventional activities in digital environ-
ments (Scopelliti 2014). The battle for attention and audience engagement is
made more diﬃcult by threats like banner blindness (a growing online advertis-
ing phenomenon); audience fragmentation, and a new active, participative and
individualistic attitude by the public (Light 2014a); the amount of noise generated
in an information society ﬂooded by content with diverse quality and sources; the
need to participate in conversations and news ﬂows about diﬀerent topics in
The Rise of Brand Journalism
125

the digital universe, especially social networks (Light 2014b); and the growing
complexity of the integration of brand messages in new formats and vehicles
with enough return of investment. Brand journalism – or “newsroom mentality”
in companies (Zuk 2012; Winkleman 2015b) – tries to be a way to confront those
challenges by the creation of relevant brand contents of outstanding value
that can attract audiences and attention with a journalistic media content logic.
That logic would also ﬁt the idea of “youtility” (Baer 2013): the provision of
contents – among other things – that are of help to the public and customers
instead of being simply an excuse to sell them products.
Brand journalism is also well suited to the way of participation in public life
that is expected from brands and companies in the so-called “age of trans-
parency” (Tapscott, Ticoll 2003). If the contribution of news media to transparency
is based on their capacity to produce relevant, objective and independent news,
the contribution of brand journalism is the quality, truth and appropriateness of
brand stories (Tascón, Pino 2014). As a matter of fact, Lyons says that “brand
journalism is meaningful, quality storytelling” (Lyons 2013, p. 11). In this sense,
brand journalism turns itself an essential tool to build a “transparent communi-
cative organization” (Taiminen et al. 2015).
Finally, many companies have decided to invest in brand journalism after
considering the singularity of twenty-ﬁrst century consumers, especially in the
digital domain. Such publics tend to take their own decisions about how to
access relevant brand information, how to interact with it and what kind of
authority should be attached to diﬀerent content sources. Moreover, consumers
are increasingly sharing their knowledge and experience with their social environ-
ment (Bruhn et al. 2012; Hermida et al. 2012). Such behavior produces increas-
ing opportunities to manage direct contact with brands – like those of brand
journalism – that do not need intermediaries like public relations ﬁrms, adver-
tising agencies or other media companies as they did before.
From a strategic perspective, brands aspire to maintain their relevance
through new ways of communicating with the audiences. But the troublesome
situation of journalism in the complex digital environment is another trend to
consider. This is not the place to go deeper into its technological, economic and
professional causes, which have already been analyzed elsewhere (see, among
others, Almiron 2010; Levy, Nielsen 2010; Franklin 2016; Russell 2011). But
some of the consequences are worth mentioning in order to understand the rise
of brand journalism.
Recently a number of “new versions of journalism” have developed as a
consequence of how easy it could be for anybody to act as a journalist (citizen
journalism, robot journalism, link journalism, networked journalism, etc.). The
126
Ángel Arrese and Francisco J. Pérez-Latre

words “every company is a media company”, popularized by Tom Forenski
(2012), a former Financial Times journalist, only has sense with the dilution of
journalism as an organized professional activity (Lobe 2013; Hamann 2015).
The crisis of news media has led many journalists – perhaps more out of
need and disappointment than conviction – to consider working as news profes-
sionals in companies or in newsrooms specializing in brand journalism as an
increasingly interesting option. The newsroom projects established in ﬁrms like
Coca Cola, General Electric, IBM, Intel and Microsoft – to mention just some of
the best-known examples – are not only staﬀed with journalists. Some of them
are led by professionals with prestige and experience in some of the best
print publishers: GE Reports’ Tomas Kellner (in Forbes) or IBM’s Steve Hamm
(in Business Week) are two good examples.
Finally, the ﬁnancial crisis of news media companies and their poor growth
prospects have also encourage some of them to create business units that focus
on the production of brand journalism content (Burke 2013; McDermott 2013).
Such a decision is usually part of a new context in the business relationship
between clients and media. Both are increasingly open to exploring new avenues
of mutually proﬁtable collaboration around new branded content formats such as
native advertising (Burke 2014). A case in point is Buzzfeed, with its team of more
than 30 ad. creatives, journalists and artists who work closely with advertisers
and their agencies to create the most ‘shareable’ stories.
This intersection between branding and journalism has resulted in a variety
of models to develop brand journalism initiatives. All of them share a basic
concept: to move from brand-centered ways to communicate about a brand (its
values, ideals or beneﬁts) to an issue-centered approach to brand communica-
tion, where brands propose topics that provoke discussion, participation and
engagement with audiences.
3 Brand Journalism Practices
The distinction between paid media, earned media and owned media is funda-
mental to understanding diﬀerent brand journalism formats. It also allows their
diﬀerentiation from other actions that manage visibility with editorial and
journalistic tools (for example, advertorials, sponsored content and native
advertising). Paid media is media you pay for, like traditional ads, Google
AdWords or other types of search or display advertising; earned media is when
content receives recognition and a following outside of traditional paid adver-
tising, through communication channels such as social media and word of
The Rise of Brand Journalism
127

mouth, or traditional publicity (see chapter 4.2 on the eﬀect of word-of-mouth in
e-marketing in this volume); ﬁnally, owned media is the media activity related to
a company or brand that is generated by the company or its agents in channels
it controls (from company websites to blogs, Facebook brand pages or Twitter
accounts). Of course, there can be activities or initiatives that integrate elements
of the three perspectives, but the distinction seems clear enough.
In its current stage of development, brand journalism follows the logic of
owned media in the sense that brands are creating communication media with
content produced according to criteria, principles and processes that resemble
the journalistic. Such media are trying to capture the interests of their com-
panies and stakeholders with their contents, and also try to participate in the
ﬂow of information about the topics that ﬁt their editorial perspectives. In some
cases, those media use several distribution windows to increase their reach:
Adobe’s CMO (www.cmo.com), for example, besides its own portal is made
accessible as sponsored content in the Wall Street Journal’s section with the
same name (http://www.wsj.com/news/cmo-today). From this point of view, the
logic of brand journalism activities diﬀers from the approach of more general
content marketing initiatives, which are based on the reach advantages of
earned media (Du Plessis 2015).
From a content production perspective, there are many options to manage a
regular ﬂow of media content for brands, but there are three main models that
can also be combined: creating in-house newsrooms, commissioning contents to
external specialists, and aggregating and curating syndicated contents. The ﬁrst
option requires a great commitment with this activity: it implies a strong invest-
ment in material and human resources. Many companies that have been quoted
in this chapter have created newsrooms that are integrated with all the content
marketing activities (for example, Coca Cola, GE, IBM, Intel, Adobe, Microsoft y
Verizon). The second option is supported by the fact that a number of news
media (including great brands like Time, New York Times, The Economist or The
Guardian, to mention some well-known examples), and advertising & PR agencies
(Publicis, 360i, Omnicom, Hill & Knowlton, among others) have started to build
newsrooms and content units to produce news and reports and manage other
brand journalism activities related to content created by their clients. This model
follows the more traditional lines of “contract publishing” that was used for
brand magazines (Dyson 2007). Finally, brand media can also be fed through
third-party content, managed directly, or with the support of the new companies
like NewsCred, Contently, Ultramedia or Rosetta, that specialize in online content
management – from creation to diﬀusion.
128
Ángel Arrese and Francisco J. Pérez-Latre

There is another way to classify and distinguish brand journalism initiatives.
It is related to the idea of editorial orientation and the goal of communication of
a brand’s contents. Along those lines, Lyons (2013) sees four models: brand
awareness (publishing stories about your company, as in GE and IBM); industry
news (publishing stories about your industry, creating coverage that supple-
ments the work of mainstream media, as in Intel and Microsoft); create and
sponsor content (establishing your company as a thought leader in a ﬁeld, as
in Adobe’s CMO); and lead generation (using content as a way to generate leads
that can be converted into customers, as in HubSpot’s case). These models,
to some extent, are well-suited to the diﬀerent types of audiences that often
dominate the ways to deﬁne brands’ media reach: employees and other internal
stakeholders; clients and potential clients; specialized audiences (media, experts,
etc.); society as a whole. It is common that branded media have one of these four
basic types as their model, with a key audience as the core, but without losing
the goal of making the basic types compatible.
No matter what the focus adopted, brand journalism practice works on
the assumption that journalistic contents and processes should be emulated.
Hubspot, for example, underlines best practices like: be transparent; don’t write
art copy; tell the truth; have an opinion/point of view; admit mistakes; get
interesting people to contribute; be promiscuous (Lyons 2013). Contently, in its
Code of Ethics, submits to these principles: adhere to journalism’s core values
of honesty, integrity, accountability, and responsibility; credit all sources of
content and ideas; ensure that the reader/viewer understands the source, sponsor,
and intent of the content; fulﬁll promises made to contributors and sources in
the course of reporting; disclose all potential conﬂicts of interest (Snow 2016).
On its part, a leading specialist in the ﬁeld, Content Marketing Institute’s (CMI)
Mike Murray considers these ideas as the key to eﬀective brand journalism:
learn/apply how journalism works; use brand journalism to be relevant to your
customers; make sure journalists can recognize the core formula of your com-
pany; help people be better customers; educate ﬁrst; measure your eﬀorts;
make brand journalism a part of your communication strategy (Murray 2013).
CMI highlights newsroom practices that can help that kind of eﬀectiveness:
operate like a newsroom; have editorial meetings every day (week); go out
in the world, do reporting; obsessively follow the news; work quickly, have a
‘twitter metabolism’ (Miller 2013).
The expression “more journalism, less branding” is an apt summary of
many of the ideas mentioned before, although every brand has its own way to
make it real. Of course, the speciﬁc company’s brand journalism model depends
on the goals and results that have been forecast: its evaluation is another crucial
aspect that should be considered.

4 Eﬀects and Results
There is not enough research to assess the impact and reception of the brand’s
journalistic content in audiences. However, we can explore some evidence
about the reactions provoked by this content related to the more conventionally
journalistic, following the lines of some isolated works that have been written
around the topic. Van Reijmersdal et al. (2010) looked at whether the balance
or imbalance between commercial and editorial content was aﬀecting the way
publications were perceived by the readers of client magazines like Kraft Foods’
Food & Family or Home Depot’s Style Ideas. Their analysis conﬁrmed what
should be expected after more generic studies into content credibility and the
persuasion process: the more the commercial orientation of a publication, the
less was the credibility perceived by readers and the more persuasive intent
was perceived by magazine readers.
Cole II and Greer (2013) linked those ﬁndings to brand journalism and
researched the eﬀect of ‘commercial frames’ and ‘editorial frames’ for the per-
ception of the contents of two hypothetical client magazines in the same product
category. They reached the conclusion that the editorial frame improved the
perception of message credibility and positive attitudes towards the brands that
were mentioned. The study also showed that identifying corporate sources of
content did not diminish message credibility – the opposite was more likely –
unless the ‘commercial frame’ and corporate sources were united, which was
especially damaging to credibility. Finally, those attitudes and evaluations were
related to readers’ involvement with the product category. According to the
study, “product involvement plays a signiﬁcant role in explaining variation in
all attitudes examined. Involvement also produces an interesting interactive
eﬀect when examined in light of the source. For low-involved consumers, cor-
porate sources led to the highest credibility ratings; for medium involvement
consumers, peer sources made content seem most credible. High involvement
participants rated content from both sources as highly credible” (Cole, Greer
2013, p. 683).
Finally, Baetzgen and Tropp (2015) reach similar conclusions when studying
the keys to success of brand-owned media. According to them, the success
depends on a complex interrelation of factors, but “content-centric factors such
as content quality and the non-advertising character of brand-owned media are
most important for creating relevant content and for achieving media success in
terms of reach and frequency” (Baetzgen, Tropp 2015, p. 135).
It seems that these conclusions justify brands’ growing interest in brand
journalism with the above mentioned philosophy of “more journalism, less
130
Ángel Arrese and Francisco J. Pérez-Latre

branding”. But of course, the goals of improving credibility and brands’ desire
to be perceived as institutions that oﬀer “insights that add value to customers’
lives” (Cole, Greer 2013, p. 684), can only be managed through measures of
traﬃc, reach, interactivity and circulation of a brand’s media, in the same way
that those parameters assess the impact of communication media and other
marketing actions in general.
The metrics of brand journalism should be proxies for relationship-building,
not vanity stats of page views (NewsCred 2015). The sequence reach – engage-
ment – conversions gives shape to the basic structure of the measures that
are typically used to evaluate content marketing eﬀects, as Figure 1 indicates.
Excluding the last conversion metrics (around lead generation), which are not
necessarily included in most brand’s media basic goals, the rest apply soundly
to brand journalism’s logic.
Beyond the evolution of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and their possible
relation to brand business indicators, the daily life of brand journalism is full of
events and situations that demand special initiatives that are diﬃcult to evaluate
in the short term. There are two examples that could be considered paradigmatic:
brand journalism around the launch of new products or projects, and the role of
brand media in crisis situations or around problems generated by negative media
coverage.
As for the ﬁrst situations, MediaSource explains in some detail how one of
its clients, Ohio State’s University Wexner Medical Center, took advantage of a
new project to experiment with “Google glasses” (The Google Glass Project) to
foster its visibility in markets and society. The total project achieved an audience
topping 320 million across company-owned and news media channels with an
advertising value exceeding $1.1 million. All brand journalism content was
shared via company-owned social media channels, including more than 73,000
YouTube plays, totaling 135,867 minutes of playing time – which is more than 94
days of continuous play. The estimated Twitter audience alone was 1.7 million
people. The content was also prominently featured on the company intranet,
reaching key internal stakeholders and inﬂuencers (MediaSource 2013).
Regarding crisis situations, there have been some interesting recent cases
that show opportunities to react that are facilitated by brand journalism.
Edgecliﬀe-Johnson (2015) has written in the Financial Times about the ways in
which companies like Amazon or Theranos have responded to negative coverage
at the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, respectively, publishing long
replies in “neutral” content platforms like Medium; or about how the Chinese
company Alibaba, after a Barron’s story that suggested that its stock value could
fall by 50%, answered with a 2,000 word letter to the publisher in Alizila, the
news site of their own company. Those responsible for Alibaba’s letter explained
The Rise of Brand Journalism
131

the decision: “We are such a high-proﬁle company that investors, analysts,
media and other key inﬂuencers will read every single word very closely”.
As the Financial Times’ article states, “companies that don’t like the headlines
journalists write are realizing that they can write their own” (Edgecliﬀe-Johnson
2015). Vara (2015) elaborates on the same idea: “Not long ago, companies that
felt they had been wronged by a news outlet could do little in response, besides
requesting a correction, penning a letter to the editor, or, in extreme cases,
taking out an ad. Now they can present their version directly to readers – on
their own Web sites or on platforms like Medium, Twitter, and Facebook”.
In both day-to-day business and special occasions, brand journalism allows
companies the opportunity to be more transparent, reach markets with a fresh
approach to communication, and publish the right message to the right audience
at the right time. In the ﬁnal analysis, it facilitates a medium and long-term goal:

improving the credibility, authority and engagement of brands, in the environ-
ment of intense noise in which increasingly wired and cynical consumers live.
However, because of the novelty of these practices, more time will be needed to
really assess the degree in which those goals are achieved.
5 Epilogue
“Brand journalism is either a great idea or a silly conceit, depending on our pre-
paredness to embrace what really lies behind those two simple words” (Edwards
2013). This quote illustrates well the challenges of a brand journalism strategy,
precisely because of the diﬃculty of achieving the right balance between
‘journalistic frames’ (distinctive of brand journalism) and ‘commercial frames’
(innate to brands’ publishing activities). As a matter of fact, the meeting of those
“two simple words” – certainly an oxymoron (Sorofman 2013) – creates a
dangerous misunderstanding of the extent to which the audience could be dis-
oriented, and conﬁrms the fuzzy borders that already exist between journalism
and many other communication activities (Holtz 2011; Yang 2015; Winkleman
2015a). From this point of view, it would probably be interesting to challenge
the denomination of this set of brand editorial activities through the use of new
concepts such as “brand publishing”, “brand storytelling” or “editorial commu-
nications” that have already been used as equivalent expressions (Foremski
2015). Such terms could avoid the suspicion that always accompanies the
“Faustian Pact” between commercial and journalistic activities, to use the The
Wall Street Journal’s editor’s words (quoted by Pompeo 2013). A pact that in the
case of “native advertising”, for example, casts professional and legal doubts
(Levi 2015).
The debate over terms is not the only, or the more relevant, debate around
brand journalism. It is an activity still in its infancy, but there are already other
issues such as its scale. Although the majority of brand media started on a
reduced scale – with exceptions like Coca Cola’s Journey or Adobe’s CMO with
newsrooms staﬀed with more than ten people – the optimal size of the team, or
the volume of content that are best suited to the goals of these projects remain
to be seen. On the one hand, the need to prioritize content quality over quantity
seems clear; on the other, it is a fact that the digital landscape is so cluttered
that there is a need to accumulate audiences using a variety of messages,
as the media that ﬁght the battles for visibility are showing (Huﬃngton Post,
Buzzfeed, Vox Media, etc.). The temptation to grow and improve KPIs with this
second approach is strong and can become a medium-term problem. As Fishkin
(2014) explains, mentioning content marketing’s extraordinary growth: “Content
The Rise of Brand Journalism
133

is powerful. It helps websites and companies earn traﬃc, earn ampliﬁcation
through social media, build trust with an audience, all at a cost far lower than
traditional or online paid marketing channels. But, sometime in the next few
years, I’m worried that it may become a more challenging, more risky, and less
dividend-paying investment. The problem is (or will be) content fatigue. And
we’ve no one to blame but ourselves”.
The integration of journalistic brand activities with the existing content
marketing initiatives, especially with ‘native advertising’ or ‘branded content’ is
another interesting topic (Basney 2014; Matteo, Zotto 2015). If brand journalism
content aspires to take advantage of its unique “journalistic/editorial frame”, it
should distinguish itself clearly from ‘native advertising’ or ‘branded content’
messages, whose nature is almost the opposite – commercial paid content with
the editorial appearance of the media that published it. But at the same time, it
also seems apparent that brands are bound to coordinate and integrate their
content marketing actions, taking advantages of the synergies and economics
derived from well-orchestrated plans. Managing both goals is not simple and
might generate a diverse set of dysfunctions that aﬀect the credibility of content
(Smith 2015).
A more important dysfunction, already mentioned in paragraph 1, could be
the impact of brand journalism activities on the ﬂow of information and news
around themes and issues of public interest. As commented by Doctor (2013),
“content marketing can blur the lines between “without fear or favor” news and
market pitches – and there will be heavy pressures to do so.” Brand journalism
representing private interests can try to manage news about current events, by
introducing into the public conversation subtle brand references that can be
diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate from other journalism. Salmon (2013) concludes, after
analyzing the distinctions between what he deﬁnes as “buzzy terms” (content
marketing, sponsored marketing, native advertising and brand journalism), that
it should never be forgotten that “they are all attempts by companies to get
consumers to read things which the company in question, or its executives,
wants those consumers to read” (without being really conscious of it, could be
added).
Finally, it is also interesting to consider what brand journalism’s future will
be. Its current explosion looks like a natural development of activities that were
conducted by many companies in the past and have since grown exponentially
through new technologies. However, what is its real growth potential? Both the
world of communication and the world of technology are in a sort of perpetual
transformation, and the eﬀects of the coming changes to brands’ relationships
with clients and stakeholders are not easily ascertained. Today we can say that
brand journalism’s growth is a fact. We will need to wait some time to under-
stand to what extent the fact has been a fad or not.

3.1 Micro-Moments, Liquidity, Intimacy
and Automation: Developments in
Programmatic Ad-tech
Abstract: This chapter assesses programmatic advertising. Programmatic adver-
tising is characterised by sensitivity to time, location, interests and the ability to
reach individuals across a variety of screen types. Here the advertising process
is increasingly automated and has the capacity to target people in relation to
what they are doing at a given moment in time. Automation applies not only to
targeting, but the creation of adverts themselves. To explore recent trends in
advertising I draw from developments in ﬁnance, liquidity and high-frequency
trading. This is less about metaphor, but more that programmatic logic un-
mistakably derives from the automated price sorting of commodities in contem-
porary ﬁnancial markets. This renews and clariﬁes long-standing critique of the
audience-as-commodity. As the chapter proceeds to unpack, the principle of
liquidity also has an experiential and phenomenological dimension that is
redolent of what Google phrases in terms of ‘micro-moments’. This is a realisa-
tion of programmatic logic as advertising seeks to intelligently interact with a
person’s life context in real-time.
1 Introduction
This chapter reﬂects on behavioural developments in advertising. I focus ex-
plicitly on programmatic techniques that promise advertisers the capacity to
oﬀer the right message, to the right person, at the right time. This means being
able to reach across device types, apps, websites and platforms to reach people
with videos, rich media, static and native ads, and even promoted tweets. To do
this, advertisers bid in real-time for advertising space and consumer attention.
The objective of programmatic techniques (henceforth known as ‘programmatic’
to reﬂect industry usage of the term) arguably has less to do with long-term
branding and stimulation of desire, than interacting with people at moments
when they may be most pre-disposed to acting, clicking or purchasing. As will
be developed, another key characteristic is that programmatic is automated.
Whereas advertising deals once took days and even weeks to negotiate, and
media had to be bought weeks if not months upfront, programmatic allows this

haggling and buying to take place in the time it takes to load a webpage. Pro-
grammatic advertising is an auction-based process whereby potentially thou-
sands of media buyers bid for the right to present advertising to a known target.
Whereas behavioural advertising is oriented to desktop computers using the
web, programmatic approaches are based on understanding always-connected
people who use a variety of screens and technologies. Programmatic includes,
expands and develops web-based behavioural techniques that use cookies to
trace and cluster web searches, and thereafter serve advertising on the basis of
who a person is rather than what they are looking at. After all, we search on
tablets while in front of the TV; review videos about products on YouTube; use
apps on the move to search for cafés to rest weary feet; and then use mobile
devices to decide what to do once revived (such as shopping, exhibitions,
sight-seeing or where to go for lunch). Advertisers seek to understand journeys
and behaviour, and thereafter be able to reach the right people with salient
messages when they are most likely to spend money, and understand which
stimuli were inﬂuential in getting us to click or buy. This is achieved by organis-
ing information about us typically collected through apps, social media, web
browsing, video watching, stores visited and physical location. To provide a
sense of popularity and scale of this approach, in 2015 Advertising Age reckoned
that programmatic buying would take $14.88 billion of the approximately $58.6
billion digital advertising market (Kantrowitw 2015). This equates to roughly 25%
of the entire digital advertising industry. In theory, programmatic oﬀers advertisers
greater precision in: who to target; geographies and times of day; command over
the beginning, mid and end stages of campaigns; evaluation of what is working
well and not so well; and which ads are being engaged with so as to only pay
for ads that are quantiﬁably eﬀective. The lure of programmatic is the promise of
enhanced control of the advertising process.
To provide understanding of the implications of programmatic approaches,
I begin by outlining the automotive context to programmatic advertising and then
progress to oﬀer a robust account of the practicalities of programmatic advertising.
This is important so as to avoid glib theorising in later sections. Having developed
an understanding of the character and form of programmatic advertising, I then
move to detail the signiﬁcance of programmatic logic. By this I mean why it is
important, and what the implications and consequences are. By this stage we
will possess a solid understanding of the practicalities of programmatic so that
we can begin to deal with it at the level of logic and theory. This will allow us to
more clearly see what it portends in terms of: liquidity, or exposure of media and
audiences to commodity mechanisms found in the purer domain of high-speed
ﬁnance; and micro-moments, Google’s moniker for programmatic advertising
that uses big data analytics and machine learning to target people as they

move through everyday life. Although these expressions derive from automated
market trading, ad-tech and on-going work in machinic pattern recognition, I
suggest that they are best appreciated with phenomenological sensitivity.
2 Background: The Story So Far
Readers of this book are likely to be familiar with behavioural advertising.
Although the term rightly suggests advertising that targets according to a
person’s behaviour, it is more accurately deﬁned in terms of third-party tracking
cookies that are employed by ad networks to gauge our interests. The role of ad
networks is to match ad spaces provided to them by web publishers with ads for
appropriate audiences. They do this by placing tracking cookies on people’s
computers so when an Internet user visits a website participating in that
particular network, the user will have a tracking cookie installed on his or her
machine that will register each time he or she visits another site participat-
ing in that network. For a sense of scale, the leading ad networks in the UK
(Advertising.com, Yahoo! and Google/DoubleClick) each reach 90% of the UK’s
online audience. Cookies, or identifying pieces of code, tell ad networks what
sorts of sites people have visited so they can target them with appropriate adver-
tising. The reason why web publishers use third-party ad networks is so they can
make revenue from their ad spaces without having to go to the eﬀort of selling
slots to advertisers. In other words, it is a labour activity that makes use of the
economies of scale that well-connected ad networks can provide. The success of
ad networks should be judged by the extent to which they can marry available
inventory from web publishers with demand from advertisers for: a) spaces in
which to place their advertising; and b) speciﬁc types of people they wish to
reach. Segmentation in behavioural advertising typically relies on ﬁve to ten
attributes (such as age, gender, income, geography, education, mind-set and
interests), but programmatic buying systems can evaluate an exponentially
large amount of input. This is the ﬁrst notable point of this chapter: program-
matic advertising makes use of a more diverse range of data sources than behav-
ioural techniques. Before we properly discuss and deﬁne programmatic advertis-
ing, there are a few more terms and practices we ﬁrst need to understand.
We now understand that ad networks are entities that serve cookies to users
and third party advertising on publishers’ sites. The next form of organisation to
recognise is the ad exchange. Ad networks and ad exchanges are related and
often confused, but they are actually quite diﬀerent. An ad exchange is similar
to a stock exchange in that they auction impressions (the unit for serving an ad
once) to the highest bidder.Whereas ad networks sell bulk amounts of ad spaces

145

(bundled to be appropriate for speciﬁc age, gender, geography and interests),
the advent of ad exchanges allows buyers and sellers to value inventory on
an impression-by-impression basis that is bid for in real-time. This means that
theoretically publishers have a better sense of who is buying and at what cost.
From the advertiser’s point of view, they receive feedback on how each impres-
sion has performed. This is impressive if we try (and fail) to consider how many
online ad impressions are served by the hour or day. The function of an ad
exchange is to allow advertisers (or an intermediary agency acting on their
behalf) to bid to serve an ad in real-time. This ‘real-time’ is deﬁned in terms of
the time it takes a webpage to load (if you press ‘refresh’ on your browser, it is
that long). The process is that:
–
a person uses an online device;
–
the device requests an ad from an ad server;
–
the request is redirected to an ad exchange;
–
the opportunity to present an ad is bid for in real-time;
–
the winner serves the ad;
–
the person sees the ad.
The success of an advertiser’s bid is decided by data about the type of user and
their interests. The role of the ad exchange is to host the auction and establish
the right user for a speciﬁc ad, on a given medium, at a price the advertiser is
willing to pay. The ad stock includes display, rich media, video, mobile, tablet
and social media inventory. As there are multiple advertisers looking for the
same customer at the same time, real-time buying (RTB) exchanges hold real-
time auctions to decide who is the best ﬁt with the potential customer. The
winner of the auction and the price of the ad space are determined by context
(relevance of the site to their product/service/organisation type) and audience
(how good a match the viewer is for the advertiser).
3 Programmatic
This brings us to programmatic advertising, or the capacity for advertisers to
automatically target consumers across a range of devices. Even within industry
discussion, RTB and programmatic approaches are confused, but there are
important diﬀerences. Programmatic typically (but not always) uses real-time
exchanges to buy ad space. The diﬀerence is that whereas RTB is a speciﬁc way
to purchase ad space (by means of auctions held as a webpage loads), program-
matic is a method to determine if the inventory space (slots on a webpage) is
146
Andrew McStay

right for the advertiser who wants to purchase it. This involves a richer than
hitherto understanding of audiences. Although media space may be bought via
RTB methods (and often is), programmatic ad buys can involve purchasing ads
that have a ﬁxed cost (rather than bid-for ones that have a changeable price). In
easier to digest terms, ad spaces might be purchased direct from the publishers
of The Economist website so that the inventory and price is agreed and ﬁxed. The
programmatic part of the transaction that diﬀerentiates it from a traditional direct
sale is the automation of the ad serving process on The Economist webpage.
I appreciate that the range of practices is diﬃcult to visualise (and is poten-
tially somewhat tedious), but the key characteristic is that the buying and sell-
ing of individual (impression-by-impression) advertising opportunities happens
with little human intervention (although some is required to enter campaign
objectives and budget). From the point of view of the advertiser wishing to
advertise, this removes a great deal of complexity as programmatic promises to
black-box the entire advertising process (media decisions, proﬁling, targeting,
delivery of ads and as developed below, even creativity). This can be contrasted
with the usual media-buying mechanisms of discussion between ad companies
and publishers, telephone calls, emails, person hours, paper work and expen-
sive executives. To put automated and programmatic advertising into context,
since the inception of advertising and newspapers in 1702,1 advertisers have
bought their advertising by talking to and negotiating rates with people. They
were locked in to a contract, forced to run a certain number of ads with a
publisher and had little idea whether anyone engaged with the advertising. The
diﬀerence is that the automation of buying and selling advertising space allows
ad buying and management of engagement on a per-impression basis.
We gain even more insight when we consider that programmatic advertising
requires a great deal of information about users. As will be developed later, the
make-up of programmatic logic is to know more about the viewing and motives
of the person clicking. Whereas behavioural advertising makes use of cookie-
based data, programmatic draws on a much wider range of data points, not
least information from apps used on mobile phones. Traditional behavioural
advertising that uses third-party cookies does not work on Apple iOS devices
because it does not allow third-party tracking cookies. Instead mobile program-
matic companies make use of “device IDs; deterministic identiﬁers unique to
handsets, or probabilistic determination; using multiple data points to create
statistical models” (Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2015).
1 Arguably since 1702 in the UK, when advertising was carried in the ﬁrst newspaper The Daily
Courant.

There are three sorts of data that programmatic advertising makes use of,
including ﬁrst-party data, the most valuable sort, where information is collected
and aggregated directly by a given web publisher. This might include purchase
behaviour and how people behave on their websites. The next tier of data that
programmatic can make use of is second-party data. This involves an unusual
business arrangement where a partner (company A) is willing to share customer
data with company B (and vice versa). For example, a person interested in
premium music ampliﬁers might visit the partner company’s site about premium
speakers and be tagged with a cookie. Lastly it also involves third-party data,
or information that is bought and sold in an open market environment. In
programmatic, this provides a great deal more data about audiences than can
be identiﬁed and extracted by behavioural ad networks. This data is bought from
what are known as data management platforms (DMPs), or data aggregators, who
have relationships with a large number of websites in order to gain a big-picture
view of users (by means of cookies and IDs on mobile phones). Notable examples
include organisations such as eXelate, Lotame and Bluekai. Third-party data can
come from a range of places including online tracking (as with behavioural
advertising), but also website registration data, public records and oﬄine trans-
action data such as loyalty cards. These diﬀerent data streams can be used
together. Lotame for example promises marketers that they can marry their
own data (from past campaigns, traﬃc through website and apps they might
own) with third-party demographic and behavioural information provided by
data sources around the world (such as MasterCard, BlueKai and Kantar). The
outcome of being able to make use of ﬁrst, second and third-party data is that
advertisers (or ﬁrst-parties) often possess colossal databases that are goldmines
of information about the buying habits and location of their customers. Super-
markets and people’s favourite retailers for example hold a great deal of infor-
mation about consumer history and interests. What programmatic allows is the
capacity to merge these with publically available demographic data, mobile
phone and credit card information, social media, and other sources available to
DMPs.
Programmatic also promises improved re-targeting (when online advertising
is targeted at consumers who visited a publisher’s website but did not buy or
fulﬁl a desired action) and sensitivity to the context in which advertising takes
place. This varies but may include: content that appears next to the ad, device
on which the ad is delivered, part of the day, day of the week and environmental
factors such as news that is being reported, sports results or celebrity events.
Beyond the automated serving of display advertising, it also promises to assist
in understanding eﬀectiveness. From the point of view of the industry, this is
the most signiﬁcant point, but in addition to real-time bidding, ad serving, ad
148
Andrew McStay

tracking and overall campaign management, programmatic technologies may
also create ads to suit contexts by automated means.
3.1 Dynamic Creative Optimisation
This is where we see a clear diﬀerence between RTB and what programmatic
portends. Although today programmatic is primarily a buying and serving
method, it also promises ‘dynamic creative optimisation’. This entails the capacity
to automatically (without human intervention) alter ads to ﬁt the viewer and
their context in real-time. For example on launching the game Madden NFL 15
in 2015, EA Sports working with Google used mobile ads with diﬀerent combina-
tions of copy, images, and backgrounds to reﬂected what was happening in the
game at that exact moment. Similarly, other brands have optimised their ads to
account for location, time of day and the weather. Adobe for example, echoing
other programmatic ﬁrms, also promise their advertisers that they can ‘build,
personalize and deliver creative assets in real time’ and that ‘Adobe oﬀers
the only platform that combines advertising, data and creative optimization to
redeﬁne programmatic marketing’ (Adobe 2015). Although one might associate
Adobe with their web design and imaging software, they are aggressive actors
in the programmatic advertising business. For a sense of the diverse range of
data types they employ to deliver dynamic content, Adobe’s (2016) privacy
page says that their analytics services collects data (including personal data)
on: the URLs of the webpages people visit and the time spent on them; the URL
of the page that showed the link people clicked on that brought them to that
company’s website; the searches that people have performed, including searches
that led them to that company’s website; information about the browser and
device, such as device type, operating system, connection speed, and display
settings; IP address, which Adobe say they may use to approximate general
location; information people may provide on that company’s website, including
information on registration forms; whether they clicked on an ad; items they
have either purchased or placed within the shopping cart feature on that com-
pany’s website; and social network proﬁle information, including photos, fan
and like status, user IDs, age, and gender. Adobe continues by saying that
some companies using Adobe services may send them information that allows
them to identify users personally (this is the ﬁrst party information mentioned
above). Further, some companies may also buy additional information about
users and then add that additional information to the information collected by
Adobe’s products on their websites. This additional information may include
things like email addresses, account information, or Facebook proﬁle informa-
tion, including photos and usernames.

3.2 The Automation of Advertising
Although often lauded as a creative business, the advertising industry has long
been interested in quantiﬁcation, feedback, analysis, veriﬁcation systems and
machine-like approaches to targeting and creating ads. This is best understood
when one considers that the rise of dedicated ad agencies in the late 1800s
parallels the rise of industrial production methods, distribution and manage-
ment. Taking cues from the empiricism of science, this approach overtly em-
phasised cause and eﬀect, predictability, control, data and the need to inject
certainty into the advertising production process. Although the advertising
giants of old introduced machinism into its methods, they could not have pre-
dicted the automation of creating, targeting, serving and collecting data about
the reception of ad content so as to generate dynamic advertising experiences.
3.3 Liquidity in Advertising
As is now clear, programmatic advertising involves automated exchanges to
deploy the right message, to the right person, at the right time, across a range
of media. There are diﬀerent types of programmatic buying: some of which are
open to all potential buyers, and others where only certain types of buyers/
advertisers are allowed. In this section I discuss the open auction format2
whereby a publisher allows any buyers to purchase their inventory at a cost
dictated by open market mechanisms. This is an important feature because
advertising is borrowing technology and techniques from the world of high-
speed trading and investment banking. We might consider the tone and character
of high-frequency trading. In the real-time ﬁnance sector people are largely
redundant as investment banks, fund managers and traders place their faith in
algorithms run by computers to buy and sell shares. To a very real degree, global
ﬁnance is automated in that it operates with little human intervention. High-
frequency trading (HFT) is controversial, but in Europe it forms over 30% of
market traﬃc. In the USA it is 70% (Ross et al. 2012). Its dramatic rise to promi-
nence has polarised opinion in the political and ﬁnancial sectors. Exponents say
it has reduced trading costs and increased activity on markets – but critics point
to two devastating US American market collapses in which HFT played a central
2 Other formats include ‘Automated Guaranteed’ (where the content does not go through an
exchange, and deals are negotiated directly between buyer and seller); ‘Unreserved Fixed
Rate’ (where costs of content are ﬁxed upfront); and ‘Invitation-Only Auction’ (where only
select advertisers can bid).
150
Andrew McStay

role. And now European policy makers are debating whether to impose severe
limits on HFT. Inﬂuential ﬁgures are even calling for it to be banned.
This is utterly unbridled capitalism in which trading is not just about buying
low and selling high, but doing so at maximum velocity. Rather than landing
‘the big deal’ (maximum diﬀerence between buy and sell), automated high-
speed trading takes advantage of tiny price discrepancies that only exist over
the most inﬁnitesimally small time horizons. The proﬁt comes from being able
to take advantages of these small proﬁt opportunities multiple times. For a sense
of speed, an article for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism comments that
‘HFT takes place at speeds more commonly associated with particle physics. In
the quarter of a second it takes you to blink, an HFT computer can carry out over
5,000 transactions’ (Ross et al. 2012). Without hyperbole, this is literally a war of
the machines. In the ﬁnance industry we see machines (or ‘algobots’) combating
each other to shave a few millionths of a second oﬀtrading time. This is done by
placing servers close to the Internet exchange and investing in ultra-high speed
feeds of market data to shave microseconds oﬀ‘latency’, or the time it takes a
trader’s message to reach the exchange and return.
Although there are diﬀerences between advertising and ﬁnancial technologies,
there are commonalities, particularly with regard to the principle of liquidity. I
use this expression both in a ﬁnancial and ontological sense, although these
are not separate. After all, our trading, banking, and payment technologies
play a fundamental role in shaping our modern world and social reality. In
ﬁnancial terms, liquidity refers to the capacity of a market to maintain a stable
asset price. The notion of stability is the capacity to buy or sell an asset without
any signiﬁcant change in the price of the asset. Cash for example is the most
liquid of assets because it can be exchanged with no loss of intrinsic value. A
house that nobody wants to buy has low liquidity value. What programmatic
(particularly the open auction format) adds to the advertising market is greater
liquidity of advertising media spaces, opportunities to serve ad impressions
through these spaces, and the data about audiences. This is due to an exponen-
tially increased number of bidders, buyers and sellers of advertising slots. Thus,
because of the high number of exchanges taking place in the programmatic
media environment, a seller’s assets (such as advertising opportunities and
audiences) are quickly and truly valued. The advertising system is not as smooth
or advanced as that found in ﬁnance, but high frequency trading provides an
excellent sense of the direction, potential and orientation, of the digital advertis-
ing sector. A barrier to this today is lack of transparency in the advertising
market. This is because there is a diﬀerence between what an advertiser will
pay for programmatic advertising and what a publisher will receive. Whereas in
Micro-Moments, Liquidity, Intimacy and Automation
151

ﬁnance the ﬁgure is the same, in advertising an intermediary takes a large slice
of what an advertiser pays. This can happen at multiple points along the adver-
tising value chain that brings together advertisers (who want the advertising
space) and the publisher (who owns the media space). Ultimately it is unclear
what fees are being paid and who along the advertising production chain3 is
adding extra cost. Part of the task for trade associations such as the Internet
Advertising Bureau today is to create a trading environment where there is
greater transparency over fees/prices, the bidding process and inventory.
Further, both buyers and sellers of ad space would like to know what the
price of this commodity is going to be in the future. Be this orange juice, coﬀee
or indeed ad space, buyers are keen to buy now if they think prices will go up,
while sellers seek to have future revenue assured (lowering future risk). What is
desirable for both buyers and sellers is reliable information about the market
price of ad space both now and tomorrow4. This is what an Advertising Age
article refers to as a ‘forward marketplace’ (Bruell 2015). The potential conse-
quence of this is that ad space itself is not only exchanged in real time, but
contracts would be auctioned for ad space to be delivered on a speciﬁed future
date/time. I appreciate this is rather detailed, but the take-home point is the
shift of digitally enhanced advertising towards a commodities market.
By seeing it through future-oriented market logic, ad space can be bought
and sold on by the buyer of the ad space. So, for example, if marketer/trader
X has paid 15€ per 1000 impressions for video display ad spaces, to reach
audience Y over Christmas, then if the price of ad space to reach this particular
audience increases, marketer/trader X may sell this stock and proﬁt from the
price diﬀerence. Even further, the consequence of this is that speculators with
no interest in using the space for advertising may buy and trade in this stock,
just as they would with tea or steel. This may still seem somewhat abstract and
unimportant, but what futures-based programmatic represents is a model for the
future of advertising. This becomes even more signiﬁcant if we project a few
years down the line and see behavioural and programmatic advertising encom-
passing PCs, tablets and mobiles, and also television and networked outdoor
media in so-called smart cities. Although advertising is typically held to be the
public face of capitalism, the reality is that in terms of liquidity and market
3 The value chain of programmatic advertising is: advertiser > agency > trading desk > demand
side platform (DSP) > ad exchange > publisher Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2013
4 Traditional ad space of course ﬂuctuates throughout the year (Superbowl minutes and pre-
christmas television is more expensive than 3 am on a Wednesday), but the point is that both
buyers and sellers of these slots appreciate certainty.
152
Andrew McStay

logic, it is catching up with other commodity forms. The move toward treating
media space as a more abstract commodity portends a very diﬀerent sort of
media system and a very diﬀerent way of doing advertising. This is possible
now because these exchanges and marketplaces provide an automated record
of every transaction and a clear record of trades.
Thus, the long cherished audience-as-commodity principle (Fuchs 2012;
McStay 2011; Smythe 1981) ﬁnds renewed impetus and full realization as ﬁrms
such as Mass Exchange lead the way in not only ad space futures exchange, but
also audience future exchanges. This means that advertisers can buy guaranteed
interest from people with desirable characteristics (for example, mothers in a
given region on a certain income range between 18 and 25 years old). Historically
audiences have been dubbed a commodity, but this is something of a misnomer
because it was not the audience being traded on an open market, but the ad
space with an assumed audience attached. Now audiences become a real com-
modity as they are placed onto a more public market open to speculators who
may have no interest in advertising (or audiences) whatsoever and, importantly,
audience value is determined by what the market (and its players) is willing to
pay (liquidity).
4 From Privacy to Intimacy
Much critical scrutiny is paid to the extent to which advertising techniques
based on people’s behaviour is invasive of privacy (Baruh 2007; McStay 2011,
2016; Zuiderveen Borgesius 2015). However, this section suggests critical con-
siderations that are related but diﬀerent. A controversial claim within contem-
porary ad-tech is the promise of knowing people in greater detail and generating
more eﬀective advertising, without the need for high amounts of personally
identiﬁable information (PII). This is digitally acquired information that can be
used either on its own or in combination with other items of information to iden-
tify people. However, what programmatic claims is that use of diverse aggre-
gated data sets can target people like you, but not you. The claim is that adver-
tising can be intimate without being personal. My point is not that advertising
no longer uses personal information (it does), nor are there no longer questions
to be asked about privacy (there are); but recognition of a tendency within the
industry to try to be more intimate without relying on increasingly personalized
and identifying data. This is driven in large part by a need to circumnavigate
regulations. My argument is that attention should be paid to practices and
experiences that are aﬀective and intimate, and that we should also note that
this intimacy is achieved through increased use of aggregation.
Micro-Moments, Liquidity, Intimacy and Automation
153

This merely echoes what advertising has always sought to do. In a sense,
traditional advertising has had to execute a more diﬃcult trick than digital
approaches because it is required to communicate personally through broadcast
means. The most successful of ‘classic’ advertising is aimed at groups, but sees
these as clusters of individuals to be inﬂuenced and persuaded on a one-by-one
basis. This is intimacy at scale. Contemporary means of achieving intimacy are
based on big data logic in that programmatic makes use of more data points
and sources (online and oﬄine), aggregates these, and processes them in real
time. This provides greater agility and reactivity by means of high levels of data
collection (about history, behaviour, places, devices, channels and contexts), yet
aggregating these so the resultant targeting is based on small group proﬁles
rather than individuals. Further, for mobile and tablet devices that make use of
Android’s ‘Advertising ID’ and Apple’s ‘Identiﬁer for Advertisers’, this is targeted
at advertising IDs that are not permanent, not tied to a device and can be re-set
(although it is debatable how privacy-enhancing this is in practice). The net
result is an attempt to balance high levels of data gathering and anonymisation
techniques to create experiences that feel intimate, yet reduce levels of personal
data processing.
4.1 Micro-Moments
The principle of intimacy is an important one because a key feature of program-
matic is that it allows advertisers to target ‘micro-moments’, or those short periods
of time when we are most receptive to a message intended to inﬂuence us
(DoubleClick 2015). There is a range of factors to consider including location,
proximity to retailers, discovery (ooh/aha!), what we are saying, who we are
saying it to, what we have searched for, videos we have watched, environmental
factors such as temperature/weather and even our physical state. Due to the
fact that smartphone users are typically always connected to the Internet, our
behaviour (physical and online) belies intent, interests, marketing opportunities
and readiness for appropriate messages.
Ontology is the admittedly vague term that refers to what exists for people.
It is an attempt to get at the quality and character of reality, how we experience it,
and how it is aﬀected by the introduction of new variables (such as technologies,
but also other phenomena). This is not just idle tracing of parallels between
technology and the humanities, because mega-tech and user experience ﬁrms
are deeply interested in the interaction between computing and human ex-
perience. Programmatic micro-moments such as those discussed by Google’s
DoubleClick represent something quite new in that it does not just seek to
understand preferences or interests, but moments. In fact ‘interact’ is a better
154
Andrew McStay

word than ‘understand’ to characterize how advertising engages with moments
because understanding does not matter, only eﬀectiveness. This becomes clearer
when we recognise that this form of understanding is predicated on being
intimate, relevant, salient and timely. Technologies do not understand us but
eﬀectively engage with potent moments when we may be swayed and aﬀected
in a way useful to a given advertiser. Although ‘micro-moments’ serve to simplify
and storify programmatic practices for DoubleClick’s clients, the premise and
orientation is worthy of consideration. For DoubleClick (2015) this is recognition
that our days are populated by ‘intent-rich moments when preferences are
shaped and decisions are made’. This premise is better understood when we
recognise advertisers’ interest in attribution, or the attempt to quantify what
aspects of advertising inﬂuences us, when inﬂuence occurs and to what degree.
This does not just involve the appreciation of single moments but the series of
life events that inform moments (where we might buy or click something). This
puts us in a phenomenological bind in that programmatic logic promises to
interact with us at the level of quality, feeling and emotion; yet it uses tools
historically thought of as alien to understanding experience. By deﬁnition
phenomenologists should disagree that the meaning of the poem can be found
in the form of the letters of which it is composed (to borrow from Bergson 1999
[1913], p. 35). If this is unclear, phenomenological criticisms are similar to Searle’s
(1998) epiphenomenal Chinese Room argument about how symbol-processing
machines cannot be said to have a mind because they do not understand the
content they are processing.
4.2 Machinic Verisimilitude
There is a very basic diﬃculty in tracing the relationship between technology
and human beings because this would require that machines could be ontologi-
cally oriented to know what people discuss in terms of quality. This is both
physically and philosophically problematic in that people and machines are
made of diﬀerent stuﬀ, and that human understanding is based on a granularity
of contextual sensitivity that machines are incapable of. Although we will not
resolve the question of ‘what is consciousness and subjectivity’ here, what we
can say is that much of what we consider to be subjective and private is already
more public than we usually think. Language, symbol use, status, ethics and
identity are all constituted by relational and social factors. By being social they
are public, and by being public they are observable. Machines may not be as
good as people at comprehension of motives, but they excel at observing and
remembering at levels and in ways impossible for people. This involves watch-
ing, listening, sensing and making inferences about actions or inaction. Memory
Micro-Moments, Liquidity, Intimacy and Automation
155

also plays a role acting as an analytical repository with which to judge (in
reference to a set of given values) what is appropriate, and clearly a-historical
machinic capacities have advantages over people in this regard. This is a-
historical data mining, or the capacity for equal recall to either recent or older
behavioural traces. This is not about authenticity, but aﬀective, eﬀective and pre-
dictive knowledge. We do not have to concern ourselves with whether machines
really understand, but consider what elsewhere I have termed machinic verisi-
militude (McStay 2014). This entails semblance of intimate knowledge of people,
and engagement with the subtleties of qualia and human experience. From a
more practical advertising point of view, it is the capacity to generate exactly
the right message, to the right person, at precisely the right time, so as to take
advantage of moments in a person’s daily life ﬂow. This has less to do with
people thought of as private self-contained unities with private interior expe-
riences inaccessible to others, but a more public view of personhood. This is a
more civic interpretation that sees a person come into being through interaction
at physical, intellectual, linguistic and social-semiotic levels. As these are public
structures, behaviour can (at least theoretically) be traced within these. This
public view of selfhood is deﬁned in terms of probability, expectation and
delivery of what we expect a person to do, given an assessment of their current
state, and what is known of their behavioural dispositions, history and con-
nections with others. This is less about privileged access to private thoughts to
conﬁrm suppositions about real motives and feelings, but instead correct assess-
ment of public data veriﬁed by the predictive power of machinic insight (such as
whether we click, buy or visit after being exposed to X stimuli in Y circumstance
at Z moment). After all, the advertising industry does not care about conscious-
ness and being per se, but functionality and eﬀectiveness deﬁned in terms of
predictive ability and the capacity for machines to meaningfully interact with
people in micro-moments. To go further, it is a resounding success if it can say
with certainty that it does not personally ‘know’ people, yet is able to inﬂuence
them at key decision points as if it did. Thus, it does not matter whether
machines can truly know us but whether they can predict what we will do
next and inﬂuence outcomes, particularly at micro-moments when we may be
inﬂuenced and pivoted towards a diﬀerent path.
5 Conclusion
In conclusion we see that programmatic advertising is signiﬁcant in multiple
respects. To list: it oﬀers advertisers greater granularity in terms of what they
are saying, whom they are targeting, on which media and when this takes place.
Underpinning this are novel technologies and practices. These are characterised
156
Andrew McStay

by automation, more sophisticated data collection and processing, and media
and audience markets characterised by greater liquidity. If we also consider
potential for high frequency trading and marginal gains selling provided at
dizzying speeds in an automated and self-driven marketplace, we see funda-
mental changes in the nature of advertising. Before we bow to the modern
digital sublime, or conjure dystopias, we should not fall prey to the belief that
programmatic is a perfect system for advertisers. Today, due to the fact that it
targets people rather than the content of websites, there is an inbuilt lack of
control over precisely where ads will land. This worries advertisers because
unfortunate ad placements can damage the reputation of the brand. It is also
besieged by ad fraud, botnets and even questions of whether real people or
machines are clicking on ads5. Programmatic is not an omnipotent advertising
system, but the logic that underpins programmatic is too powerful to be
deterred. It has a number of characteristics in that it intends to map the entire
context of our lives, and it seeks informational and emotional relevance at
precisely the right instant. At the level of principle, it is not contained by
desktop, tablet or mobile devices, but will spill over onto televisions and into
networked ads in our cities. For example, in 2015 we saw the ﬁrst rollout of
artiﬁcial emotional intelligence in out-of-home advertising and it is a short step
to connect smartphones with these practices (McStay 2015). The language of
programmatic advertising also invites philosophical sensitivity as it seeks to
understand and inﬂuence human ‘micro-moments’. This phrasing by Double-

3.2 The Legal and Ethical Aspects of
Collecting and Using Information
about the Consumer
Abstract: On the Internet, consumers and citizens are increasingly monitored
and tracked. The collection and use of information about consumers serves
diﬀerent goals, has various legal implications and raises important ethical ques-
tions. From a legal perspective, the most important issue is the compliance of
such activities with data protection law. Today, such compliance is often doubt-
ful given that the collection and use of information about consumers often lacks
the transparency required by law and fails to meet the relatively high standard
of informed consent. From an ethical perspective, transparency seems to be key
as well. Given that the long-term success of Internet businesses will depend on
their compliance with the applicable law and on consumers’ trust, providing full
transparency with regard to the entire process of collecting and using informa-
tion about consumers seems to be crucial.
1 Introduction
In recent years, the Internet has evolved from a communication platform to a
place of work, leisure and consumption that encompasses almost all kinds of
everyday activity. While the function of a communication platform is still a key
issue, many activities that go beyond that of mere communication can be con-
ducted online, e.g. shopping1 and mobile banking. With the increasing mobile
use of the Internet, it is possible to write or read e-mails,2 visit websites,3 or

use social media4 almost anywhere and at any given time. With the use of
mobile wearable or ingestible devices that we will carry on or in our bodies, we
may even reach the point where we have only one connection left to the outside
world: our personal connection to the Internet.
Although such a pervasive Internet scenario may still sound somewhat futur-
istic, and although one can think of many ways how people would try to avoid
living in such a world, many aspects of our everyday activities, both as citizens
and consumers, have already changed fundamentally. The migration of these
activities into an online environment has created a broad range of opportunities
for commercial activities: ﬁrst, businesses can collect vast amounts of informa-
tion about consumers given that their online activities can be easily tracked,
stored and analysed in order to better understand the needs and wishes of every
individual consumer. Second, electronic communication allows the tailoring of
products and services as well as prices to every individual consumer based on
previously collected information. Against this background, we will outline some
of the most important ways of collecting and using information about consumers
and assess the legal and ethical implications of such activities.
2 The Reality of Consumers’ Online Activities
2.1 Collecting Information about Consumers
Surﬁng on the Internet is far from being an activity devoid of consequences;
anyone who uses the Internet leaves data tracks both intentionally and un-
intentionally.
2.1.1 Self-published Data
Internet users, particularly social network users, voluntarily disclose a plethora
of personal information on the Internet.5 This information, which is often almost
as good as publicly available, typically relates to information about the users’
public but also private life (e.g. addresses, dates of birth, credit card numbers,
phone numbers, etc.) and to pictures disclosing further personal elements about
the user.

2.1.2 Monitoring Online Behaviour
The monitoring of consumers’ online activity primarily aims at collecting con-
sumer data in order to improve existing online processes, deliver better services
and provide a better user experience. Additionally, online monitoring is used for
security reasons to protect consumers and service providers against malicious
online activity. The activity of Internet users can be monitored by observing their
digital footprints. Such footprints result e.g. from information voluntarily dis-
closed by users on websites, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the devices
used and further information gathered through the use of cookies and other
tracking methods.
IP addresses: To be present online, individuals’ and businesses’ electronic
devices need to have a speciﬁc, non-physical IP address, which is a numerical
label assigned to each device that is connected to the Internet. IP addresses
cannot be directly controlled by the users themselves since the allocation of such
addresses is (directly or indirectly) derived from the Internet Address Registries.
Online electronic devices “communicate” through the use of a traceable IP
address, thereby leaving data tracks on visited websites. Monitoring mecha-
nisms record the IP addresses used to automatically analyse the users’ origin,
the nature of their requests and the average time spent on the Internet in general
and on certain websites in particular6. In addition, these addresses enable the (at
least temporary) assignment of data to certain users which can help to identify
potentially illegal activities. The advertising industry, however, uses IP addresses
to track individual users and to rate the value of an advertisement.7
Cookies and Other Applications: When a user requests a website, quite often,
so-called “Internet cookies” are downloaded on the user’s electronic device.
These small pieces of information can be used either by the website’s operator
or the provider of an advertising banner implemented in such a website and
may contain an identiﬁer, typically a string of random letters and numbers.8
Cookies enable servers to identify users by assigning information logged on the
server to individual users, thereby enabling advertisers to track users so that
they can target them with personalised advertising.9 Further, so-called “web

7 httpsː//support.google.com/adwords/answer/2456138?hl=en (last accessed on 29 November
2016).
8 A cookie consists of a name and a value which may contain any text or numbers. The user’s
device can add attributes to the cookie which are not sent to the web server. Attributes may for
example contain the domain name of the relevant website in order to avoid access by other
websites.

beacons” are used. Web beacons are graphics that are embedded in websites or
e-mails pursuing the purpose of online tracking. They enable the originator to
determine who accessed a website or read an e-mail, at what time and from
which computer such activity took place, etc. In addition to Internet cookies
and web beacons, so-called “device ﬁngerprinting” is gaining in importance.
For this ﬁngerprinting process, various information about the user’s browser,
operating system, system colours, installed plug-ins and typefaces is gathered
which, combined, ultimately produces a digital ﬁngerprint of a speciﬁc device.
This process can be used to identify the user’s device when cookies are not
available. In combination with other data, conclusions about the type of device
used and the respective Internet user may be drawn.
As a reaction to these developments, numerous networking techniques have
been developed in recent years that help avoid any kind of data recording and
protect individuals’ privacy in the online world. These techniques include, e.g.,
privacy enhancing technologies (PET) and anonymizing networking techniques.10
2.1.3 Data Theft
In addition to the personal information that users voluntarily disclose online
and the information that is gathered through legally permissible monitoring
techniques, personal data can also be obtained and gathered through illegal
means. Recently, an increase of data theft has been reported as a result of
intruders hacking into e-mail accounts, social media accounts or online bank
accounts11.
In practice, there are many reasons why hackers choose to engage in data
theft. Data, particularly personal data, is a source of great value12. This value is
appealing for hackers who seek to gain ﬁnancial advantages through illegal
means13. Further, Internet activists, such as the “Chaos Computer Club” may

seek to show technical vulnerabilities. Other activists, such as “Anonymous” or
“the Impact Team” may use their technical knowhow for political goals, such as
exposing alleged misconduct. One case in point was the breach of the commer-
cial website Ashley Madison, which enabled extramarital aﬀairs.14 In this highly
publicised case, hackers penetrated the servers of the company, stole sensitive
client information and published the information online15.
2.2 Using Information about Consumers
Data collected online can be used in multiple ways. Apart from e-mail marketing
and personalised advertising (especially within social media), data vending also
comes into consideration.
2.2.1 E-Mail Marketing
Internet users disclose their personal information online with little hesitation,
for instance when purchasing products online, in order to obtain a company’s
newsletter or to participate in an online contest. Such information typically in-
cludes names, dates of birth, postal addresses, credit card numbers and e-mail
addresses. Companies gather and store such information and use it to provide
users with “traditional” as well as personalised advertisements.
2.2.2 Personalised Advertising
The collected data is analysed in order to identify the interests of the Internet
users. The knowledge thus acquired enables companies to anticipate which
goods each individual customer might need or want. Thus, when such customers
visit other websites, they are delivered advertisements that are tailored to their
previously identiﬁed interests. Such personalised advertising is becoming exceed-
ingly prevalent. In a sense, personalised advertising can be seen as an evolved
technique of “retargeting”, whereby users are shown advertisements of products

they previously viewed on a website but did not end up buying16, with an added
personalisation/customisation dimension.17 The idea behind personalised adver-
tising is that, by indirectly reminding customers of items they considered buying,
companies increase the purchase likelihood of the respective customer.
2.2.3 Data Vending
Given the nearly inﬁnite possibilities of using personal information for business
purposes, businesses consider and use personal data as tradable goods. In recent
years, an independent business branch has emerged around the trading of Inter-
net users’ personal information (data vending). Personal data vending, i.e. the
sale by commercial data vendors of personal data as a commodity, has become
a multibillion-dollar industry.18
3 Legal Aspects
3.1 Preliminary Remarks
The collection and use of information about consumers raises a number of legal
issues, above all with regard to data protection law. Other relevant legal areas
include unfair competition law and criminal law, the latter namely with regard
to data theft. Unfair competition law may apply as a consequence of data mis-
appropriation or the misleading use of information. However, since EU law has
hardly been harmonised with regard to criminal law and only partially so with
regard to unfair competition law and since legal issues in these areas are to date
relatively sparse, the following considerations will focus exclusively on data
protection law.
With regard to the law applicable on the Internet, it should be noted that
most often, the laws of more than one country may apply. Which law must be
applied to a speciﬁc legal issue is determined by a complex body of legal rules,
namely the so-called “private international law” and other “conﬂict of laws”
rules. As a general rule, one can say that Internet service providers that oﬀer
their services in a given national market must comply with the national laws

of said market. Accordingly, multi-national businesses will have to tailor their
services to the requirements of potentially very numerous national laws.
3.2 Legal Framework for Data Protection
Data protection law has been (and currently still is) a matter of national legisla-
tion throughout the EU and has only been partially harmonised by the Data
Protection Directive 95/4619. As a consequence, advertising campaigns that use
information about consumers in diﬀerent member states must comply with all
applicable national data protection laws. This requirement has led to signiﬁcant
obstacles for transnational businesses and hindered the full establishment of a
Digital Single Market.
Against this background, the EU long envisaged full harmonisation of data
protection law which ultimately resulted in the adoption of the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR). In January 2012, the EU Commission presented
its proposed draft regulation to the European Parliament and the European
Council.20 An extensively amended version of this draft was adopted by the
European Parliament in March 201421 and, after lengthy discussions, the Euro-
pean Council presented its General Approach in June 2015.22 On 17 December
2015, representatives of the European Parliament, the European Council and the
European Commission ﬁnally agreed on a consolidated version of the GDPR.23

The Legal and Ethical Aspects of Collecting
167

This version was adopted by the European Council and the European Parliament
on 8 April and 14 April 2016. It entered into force on 24 May 2016 and will
become eﬀective from 25 May 2018.24
Contrary to today’s state of law, the GDPR will establish a single set of rules
on data protection, which will be valid across the EU. This will, to a large extent,
resolve the current fragmentation at national level. Further, the GDPR will leave
little leeway for EU Member States to adopt stronger protection standards. The
rules contained in the GDPR will apply to any company worldwide that provides
its services in the EU, thereby enhancing fair competition in particular between
US and European players in the advertising industry. The twin aims of the GDPR
are to enhance the level of protection of personal data as well as to increase
business opportunities in the Digital Single Market by providing a single set of
rules for all businesses throughout the EU.25 Against this background the legal
assessment of the collection and use of information about consumers is based
on provisions of the GDPR.
3.3 General Principles of Data Protection Law
3.3.1 Processing of Personal Data
The application of data protection law is triggered by any processing of personal
data. Both notions of “processing” and “personal data” are construed very
broadly, which results in a very broad scope of application of data protection
law.
The notion of personal data encompasses “any information relating to an
identiﬁed or identiﬁable natural person”, the so called “data subject” (Art. 4 (1)
GDPR). Processing refers to “any operation or set of operations which is performed
upon personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated
means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adapta-
tion or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dis-
semination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction,
erasure or destruction” (Art. 4 (2) GDPR).

The compliance of the data processing with the requirements of data pro-
tection law must be ascertained by the data controller, i.e. “the natural or legal
person, public authority, agency or any other body which, alone or jointly with
others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data”
(Art. 4 (7) GDPR).
3.3.2 Substantive Guiding Principles
The processing of personal data is only legitimate if such processing complies
with a number of general principles. According to the GDPR:
–
personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner
in relation to the data subject (“lawfulness, fairness and transparency”)
(Art. 5 (1) (a) GDPR);
–
personal data must be collected for speciﬁed, explicit and legitimate purposes
and must not be further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes
(“purpose limitation”) (Art. 5 (1) (b) GDPR);
–
personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to the minimum neces-
sary in relation to the purpose for which they are processed (“data minimisa-
tion”) (Art. 5 (1) (c) GDPR);
–
personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
(“accuracy”) (Art. 5 (1) (d) GDPR);
–
personal data must be kept in a form which permits identiﬁcation of data
subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which such
data are processed (“storage limitation”) (Art. 5 (1) (e) GDPR); and
–
personal data must be processed in a way that ensures appropriate security
of such data (“integrity and conﬁdentiality”) (Art. 5 (1) (f) GDPR).
For the collection and use of information about consumers, the principles of
transparency, purpose limitation and data minimisation are of utmost importance.
Therefore, the use cases identiﬁed above will have to be assessed with regard to
their compliance with these principles.
3.3.3 Criteria for Making Data Processing Legitimate
Irrespective of whether or not it complies with the above general data protection
principles, the processing of personal data is legitimate only if at least one out
of six criteria is met. As such, the processing of personal data is legitimate if any
of the below is given:
The Legal and Ethical Aspects of Collecting
169

–
the data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data
for one or more speciﬁc purposes (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR); consent thereby
means any freely given, speciﬁc, informed and unambiguous indication of
the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, either by a statement or by a
clear aﬃrmative action, signiﬁes agreement to the processing of his or her
personal data (Art. 4 (11) GDPR);
–
the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the
data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data
subject prior to entering into a contract (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR);
–
the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which
the data controller is subject (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR);
–
the processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data
subject or of another natural person (Art. 6 (1) (d) GDPR);
–
the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
the public interest or in the exercise of oﬃcial authority vested in the data
controller (Art. 6 (1) (e) GDPR); or
–
the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
by the data controller or by a third party, except where such interests are over-
ridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
(Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR).
Both in general and with regard to the collection and use of information about
consumers, the most important criterion for the legitimacy of data processing is
that of consent. Given that advertising is usually just a ﬁrst step on the some-
times long way to the conclusion of a contract, the criterion of necessity for the
performance of a contract will hardly ever be met in the use cases that will be
discussed below. The same holds true for the criterion of the legitimate interests
pursued by the data controller since the interest of the consumers in the protec-
tion of their fundamental right to privacy will likely always be favoured over the
interests of the data controller in targeting/customising its advertisements to an
individual consumer.26 Accordingly, the following analysis of the use cases will
focus on consent.
Failure to comply with the GDPR has important consequences. First, every-
one who has suﬀered material or immaterial damage as a result of an infringe-

Protección de Datos (AEPD) and Mario Costeja González, C‑131/12, n 80/81 and n 97, in which

ride, as a rule, (. . .) the economic interest of the operator of the search engine”.

for the damage suﬀered (Art. 82 (1) GDPR). In addition, heavy administrative
ﬁnes can be imposed by the national supervisory authority which is responsible
for monitoring the application of the GDPR (Art. 83 GDPR). Such ﬁnes, which
must be “eﬀective, proportionate and dissuasive” must take into account a number
of factors, including whether the infringement was intentional and what action,
if any, was taken to mitigate the damage.
3.4 Collecting Personal Information
3.4.1 Self-published Data
The mere fact that data subjects voluntarily publish their personal information
online, e.g. on a website or on social media platforms, does not release an
advertiser from its duty to comply with the requirements of data protection law.
Accordingly, the advertiser may only collect and use such personal information
for advertising purposes if the consumer has given his or her consent. Such
consent cannot be derived from the mere publication of the data by the con-
sumer since, as mentioned above, consent must be “speciﬁc, informed and
unambiguous”.27
Due to the consent requirement, it will hardly ever be lawful to use informa-
tion published on a website by a consumer for advertising purposes. However,
this assessment does not apply to the collection and use of information published
on social media platforms, since the general Terms of Service (ToS) and the
respective privacy policies of such platforms almost always contain provi-
sions that authorise the social media platform providers to use the information
published by their users for various purposes, including the display of per-
sonalised advertising.28 Plainly, particularly from an ethical perspective, the
legitimacy of such behaviour appears to be at the very least doubtful.29 Even
from a legal perspective, it is unclear to what extent the provisions of such
platforms’ ToS and the respective privacy policies are valid, given that such ToS
will be declared invalid in a trial if they cause a signiﬁcant imbalance in the
parties’ rights and obligations to the detriment of the consumer30.

3.4.2 Monitoring Online Behaviour
As with the collection of self-published data, the collection of information about
consumers through the monitoring of their online behaviour must comply with
the requirements of data protection law. An important distinction to self-published
data is that, in this scenario, consumers do not intentionally provide their personal
information. Despite the public debate and the vast media coverage regarding
the surveillance issue, particularly since the Snowden revelations, there are still
consumers who appear to be unaware of the fact that their online behaviour
is being monitored by Internet service providers, web publishers, social media
operators and other online businesses. To make matters worse, even those who
are aware of the ongoing monitoring activities do not have the means to know
the exact extent to which data about them is being collected, what other data it
will be combined with and for what purposes the data will be used.
Monitoring the online behaviour of consumers for advertising purposes is
only lawful if the conditions of the GDPR are met. These conditions are twofold:
First, the information must be collected in a transparent manner (i.e. an open
and honest manner) and for speciﬁed, explicit and legitimate purposes and
it must be limited to the minimum necessary in relation to these purposes.31
Second, the consumer must have given his or her informed consent to the
processing of his or her personal data. As with self-published data, consumers
are often required to consent by merely checking a box indicating their agree-
ment with the ToS of a website or an Internet service provider and the respective
privacy policy. However, the processing of data based on such consent is only
lawful if the consumer has been informed about the collection and use of his
or her personal data in a way that enables him or her to actually understand
what the data is being collected and used for. Given that numerous privacy
policies only provide very general and vague information about the use of
personal data, the requirement of informed consent often fails to be fulﬁlled.
In addition to the general requirements of the GDPR, the EU Directive on
Privacy and Electronic Communications 2002/58 (E-Privacy Directive)32 contains
a speciﬁc provision regarding the use of cookies. According to this provision,
the use of cookies is only allowed if the user concerned has given his or her con-
sent after having been provided with clear and comprehensive information
31 See above No. 3.3.2.
32 Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning
the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications
sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), Oﬃcial Journal L 201, 31 July 2002
pp. 37–47, currently under revision.

about the purpose of the processing of his or her personal data.33 Website pro-
viders most often attempt to fulﬁll this requirement through the use of a pop-up
window that informs the Internet user about the intended use of cookies and re-
quires the user to agree to such use by checking a box embedded in the pop-up
window. In principle, if the user does not check the box, he or she is deemed not
having given his or her consent to the use of cookies. However, even if the user
does not, in eﬀect, check the box accepting cookies, to the extent he or she is
given a clear and unavoidable notice that cookies will be used and, on that
basis, chooses to nevertheless access the website, website providers could,
under certain circumstances, rely on so called “implied consent” in order to
serve such user with cookies.
3.4.3 Data and Identity Theft
The term data theft describes the illegal transfer and storage of any personal and
conﬁdential information such as passwords, social security numbers or credit
card information from a business or an individual. Identity theft is the use of
someone else’s identity by using another person’s personal data. Data and iden-
tity theft may constitute criminal oﬀenses. In addition, such acts will often fail
to comply with the requirements of data protection law, namely if stolen data is
disclosed to third persons and/or used for commercial purposes.
3.5 Using Personal Information
The use of personal information relating to consumers is subject to the same
data protection requirements as the collection of such information. Accordingly,
the following use cases will have to be tested with regard to their compliance
with the general data protection principles and with regard to the consumers’
informed consent:
3.5.1 E-Mail Marketing
The e-mail addresses that advertisers require for the purpose of carrying out
e-mail marketing can be collected from various sources.34 If the e-mail address
33 Art. 5 (3) Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002
concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic
communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications).
34 See above 2.2.1.
The Legal and Ethical Aspects of Collecting
173

consists of or contains the real name of an individual consumer or if the
provider of the e-mail address otherwise allows the advertiser to identify the
individual consumer, the acquiring of the e-mail address and the sending of an
e-mail to this address qualiﬁes as processing of personal data. If the e-mail
address consists of a pseudonym, the sending of e-mails to such an address
qualiﬁes as processing of personal data only to the extent the owner of the
email-account can be identiﬁed by other means, e.g. by using additional infor-
mation that has been collected or is readily available. If a consumer can be iden-
tiﬁed, the sending of e-mails to this consumer must comply with the general
requirements of the GDPR, namely the transparency principle and the require-
ment of informed consent. Accordingly, the consumer must be informed about
the storing and use of his or her e-mail address for advertising purposes and he
or she must consent to such use.
In addition to these general requirements, the E-Privacy Directive contains
a speciﬁc provision to ﬁght spam mail. According to this provision, the use of
e-mail for the purpose of direct marketing is only allowed in respect of sub-
scribers or users who have given their prior consent.35 If a business has obtained
electronic contact details, such as an e-mail address of its customer, the business
may use such contact details for the marketing of its similar products or services,
provided the customer is given the opportunity to object to the use of his or her
electronic contact details free of charge and easily.36 Accordingly, all e-mails
sent to consumers for marketing purposes must include a button, a link, a
reply-mechanism or the like that allows consumers to unsubscribe from the
respective mailing list with only a few clicks.
3.5.2 Personalised Advertising
In order to target consumers and carry out personalised advertisements, adver-
tisers must be in a position to distinguish individual consumers and identify
their needs. In the oﬄine world, such practices would generally require adver-
tisers to identify individual consumers by their real name, e.g. in order to
send personalised advertisements to their physical address. In the online world,
however, consumers can be targeted with personalised advertisements if the
advertiser is able to recognize an individual consumer as being the same
35 Art. 13 (1) Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July
2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic
communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications).
36 Art. 13 (2) Directive 2002/58/EC.

consumer who engaged in a speciﬁc behaviour and/or expressed an interest in a
speciﬁc product or service at an earlier stage, e.g. when visiting a website,
searching for a product, or clicking on the link to an advertisement. As a conse-
quence, personalised advertising is possible in an online environment without
knowing the actual identity of an individual consumer.
From the perspective of data protection law, the fact that consumers can be
recognized and retargeted in the online environment without knowing their real
name or their physical appearance raises the fundamental question of how the
notion of an “identiﬁed or identiﬁable natural person” is to be understood. Does
this notion require that the natural person can be identiﬁed as a physical being,
ultimately by knowing his or her real name? Or is it suﬃcient if an individual
Internet user with individual characteristics can be distinguished from other
Internet users without being able to actually link the proﬁle of this individual
Internet user to a physical being? Since this question is still being debated and
since authorities tend to favour a broad understanding of the notion of identi-
ﬁed or identiﬁable natural person,37 advertisers should ensure that personalised
advertisements consistently comply with the general data protection principles,
particularly the principles of transparency, purpose limitation and data minimi-
sation, and that personalised advertising campaigns are based on consumers’
informed consent.
3.5.3 Data Vending
The sale of personal data consists of at least two aspects. First, a sales contract
is concluded pursuant to which the seller undertakes to transfer personal data
to the buyer and the buyer undertakes to pay the agreed sales price. Second,
the seller transfers the personal data and the buyer pays the agreed sales price.
While the conclusion of a sales contract is irrelevant from the perspective of
data protection law, the actual transfer of personal data or the granting of access
to such data qualiﬁes as data processing. More speciﬁcally, such acts qualify as
a “disclosure by transmission” or a “making available” of personal data.38
As a consequence, the sale of information regarding consumers must comply
with the general data protection principles and be based on the consumers’
informed consent. Such consent is usually granted by way of having consumers
37 The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party advocates that a person can be identiﬁed not
only through the name but also through other identiﬁers that are used to single someone out,
see Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data, 14. See also Recital 30 GDPR.
38 See above, 3.3.1.
The Legal and Ethical Aspects of Collecting

agree to privacy policies that typically allow the data controller to transfer the
data to third parties. If consumers have generally agreed to such transfer, the
data controller is not required to obtain additional consent from the consumer
when undertaking the actual sale and transfer of the data. In addition, since
consumers do not “own” their personal data, they are not entitled to any share
of the sales price that the buyer pays to the seller in consideration for the acqui-
sition of the consumers’ personal data.
4 Ethical Aspects
4.1 Preliminary Remarks
The legal system provides for a basic framework of rules regarding the collection
and use of personal data. This system is supplemented by ethics and ethical
considerations, which evidently play a vital role in this context. Internet service
providers must engage in behaviour that is generally perceived by Internet users
as being ethical in order to (re)gain the users’ trust and their acceptance re-
garding the collection and use of their data. This matters in particular for
personalised advertising since the success of such an advertising method is
considerably premised on the users’ trust and acceptance of the activities under-
lying such advertising. Trust, which is a key success factor in the online environ-
ment,39 is closely linked to ethical behaviour. Accordingly, the following sections
will discuss the collection and use of consumer data from an ethical perspective.
4.2 The Foundation of Ethics
Stemming from the Greek word “ethos” that enshrines two diﬀerent meanings,
i.e. habit/custom and character/morals,40 the term ethics is addressed in diﬀerent
contexts, for example: (i) in the context of reﬂecting the position of those aﬀected
by valid moral claims, (ii) with regard to the critical assessment of practical
procedures and (iii) for highlighting issues of social responsibility and moral
competences.41 By referring to the established conventions of social groups,

Ethik, Vol. 23, Duncker & Humblot 2015, pp. 95–111.

the notion of ethics encompasses the “socially valid moral rights, duties and
behavioural norms deriving from a culture-speciﬁc tradition”.42 In a nutshell,
ethics is about acting morally43.
Ethics is also an academic discipline that evaluates normative claims from a
transparent and unbiased perspective and thereby addresses principles or rules
which discuss good human action.44 In that regard, literature identiﬁes three
types of ethics,45 namely (i) descriptive or empirical ethics which outlines the
diverse appearances of existing morals and the customs of individuals, groups,
institutions and cultures, (ii) normative ethics which analyses the existing atti-
tudes towards morality and framing action-oriented norms, and (iii) meta-ethics
which critically challenges existing ethical methods and develops more distinc-
tive behavioural attitudes.
4.3 Ethics in Internet Governance and Social Networks
Despite featuring in recent discussions about Internet governance46, the impor-
tance of ethics does not appear to be adequately reﬂected in the various materials
relating to the issue of Internet governance. Indeed, only a small section of the
examined declarations, guidelines, and frameworks refer to the necessity of
implementing basic ethical rules with respect to the Internet and its use.47 In
addition, principles regarding the ethical component appear to be somewhat
vague and disparate.48 While some documents mention ethical issues in greater
detail, others barely touch upon it.49 Therefore, a more in-depth assessment of
the core relevant ethical principles in the digital environment appears neces-
sary. It should be noted that the fact that the ethics issue has been increas-
ingly discussed in the past few years can be interpreted as a sign of its growing
importance.
Social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, oﬀer users world-
wide the possibility to share (personal) information and participate in public

discourse. The rise and success of social media networks has been paralleled by
the continuing growth of such networks’ members and/or users. As such, for
instance, the number of active users of Facebook has tripled over the last ﬁve
years.50
Given that ethical behaviour ultimately helps improve public perception,
social networks have developed and published ToS that purport to protect their
users’ rights, particularly in respect of users’ information privacy and intellec-
tual property. Twitter, for instance, promotes tweeting in “real-time”51 on a
network that supports free speech. In this context, the platform states its belief
“that the open and free exchange of information has a positive global impact”.52
However, interestingly, this statement with a seemingly noble goal is followed
by a “guide to growing your business with Twitter”53. This evidences the fact
that ultimately any eﬀorts to gain users’ trust and preserve their loyalty, as well
as become more attractive to potential new users, are in fact guided entirely by
businesses’ self-interest. In other words, ultimately, most companies follow
the well-known formula: “There is one and only one social responsibility of
business [. . .] (namely) to increase its proﬁts.”54 This seems somewhat logical
if one considers that social networks largely depend on advertising revenues.
Attracting more users evidently increases such revenues. Accordingly, social
networks’ ToS are generally overly social network-friendly; in particular, they
typically provide for the right of social networks to engage in unrestricted com-
mercial marketing activities. Consequently, any claims of purported ethical be-
haviour by social networks can be criticised as being (possibly) true in theory
but not in practice.55 Hence, there is undoubtedly much room for improvement
with regard to the ethical standards of social networks.
4.4 Ethical Considerations Related to Collecting and Using
Personal Data
4.4.1 Collecting Personal Information
With regard to ethical or moral considerations, it is not possible to refer to
speciﬁc regulations. At ﬁrst glance, it could seem that the automatic collection

Rolf H. Weber and Florent Thouvenin

of self-published data and the monitoring of Internet users’ online behaviour do
not raise any ethical issues. This may be true in particular if the collection of
(the intentionally/voluntarily and unintentionally provided) data serves a valid
purpose, such as the protection of other Internet users or even the democratic
order. But, the average consumer is not necessarily well-informed about the
fact that any data that he or she provides or generates online, including his or
her personal information such as physical addresses, pictures or IP-addresses,
will potentially be stored “somewhere”. Therefore, the stance taken here is that
entities collecting such data should be required to take measures to suﬃciently
protect such data against data breach and theft.
Where data is collected primarily for advertising purposes, transparency
is particularly crucial. Transparency requires that Internet users be informed in
advance about the fact that their data is being collected so that they may use the
Internet with full awareness of the consequences. The collection of (personal)
data without appropriate prior information/disclosure to Internet users and
particularly the use of cookies and other tracking mechanisms allowing the
establishment of a user’s proﬁle (browsing and purchasing habits, demographic
data, and statistical information, etc.) is ethically questionable.
4.4.2 Using Personal Information
While the issues raised by the collection of personal data may appear to be
relatively contained, the use of such data inevitably raises diﬃcult questions.
The establishment of data proﬁles allowing corporations to provide data subjects
with personalised advertising serves no other goal than that of ﬁnancial gain.
The pursuit of ﬁnancial gain does not in itself raise ethical problems as long as
the Internet user is duly informed about both the collection and the processing
of his or her data. In this context, ethical behaviour requires transparency during
the entire process, from the provision of adequate information regarding the
storage of (personal) data through the compliance with the right of Internet
users to be informed about the storage of their data to their right to object to
the storage and transfer of their data.
From an ethical point of view, data vending deserves special attention.
Indeed, trading Internet users’ personal data inevitably raises numerous ethical
questions, such as: Is the Internet user aware of the fact that his or her data is
being traded, does he or she know what data is being traded, who obtains the
data, is the data duly protected against data breaches, etc.? In addition, consent
to store personal data does not automatically include the right to “sell” such
The Legal and Ethical Aspects of Collecting
179

data. More importantly, the largely uncontrolled proliferation of data to a large
extent undermines the right of Internet users to decide how their data shall or
shall not be published.
4.5 Responsibility of Users
Given the fact that the Internet and all activities conducted online depend on the
participation of users, it seems fair to demand that Internet users bear a certain
responsibility while using the Internet. In this vein, Internet users should move
from being passive to becoming active users by speaking out for their rights.56
Internet users should start acting as responsible human beings and create a
more citizen-driven information environment.57
In addition, Internet users should hold the corporations behind the net-
works accountable for their regulatory decisions.58 To improve transparency,
companies must in particular be required to regularly and automatically inform
the general public on how the gathered information is being used.59 The more
Internet users actively make use of their rights and freedoms, the more diﬃcult
it will be for governments and corporations to deprive them of such rights and
freedoms.60 In contrast, as long as only a few users insist on the compliance
of collecting and using their data with their fundamental rights, there is a risk
that these (few) voices are not taken seriously and that the respective indi-
viduals are practically deprived of the use of such services due to their dis-
agreement with the respective privacy policies. Such a development would be
ethically undesirable.
5 Outlook
The collection and use of information about consumers has become an essential
tool of commercial communication. It is fair to assume that the techniques used
to monitor and track consumer behaviour in order to serve consumers with
personalised advertising will be further developed and increasingly used in the

future. Arguably, the processing of information about consumers by advertisers
is not inherently problematic, as long as such processing is done in accordance
with the applicable legal requirements and generally accepted ethical principles.
The success of personalised advertising will largely depend on whether
the collection and use of information about consumers’ behaviour is or is not
accepted by Internet users. Such acceptance will require bringing back (user)
trust in the Internet and particularly (re-)building trust between advertisers and
consumers. Trust seems to have been broken as a result of users learning about
the ongoing large-scale collection and use of their data by Internet service
providers. It is now up to the providers to restore trust and to resolve at least
in part the current disinformation of Internet users by providing complete and
accurate information on the processing of personal data. For the (re-)building of
trust, two elements seem to be key:
First, information about consumers should never be collected and used for
advertising purposes without the informed consent of the consumers. Second, to
enable a truly informed consent, advertisers will need to ensure full trans-
parency with regard to the information they collect, the purpose(s) the informa-
tion is used for, the time period during which the information is stored, and the
identity of the third parties who may access the information or even receive a
copy thereof. As such, transparency will be the decisive factor that enables users
to make truly informed decisions. Today, the information provided to consumers
hardly ever meets these criteria. Providing both more speciﬁc and more compre-
hensive information about the use of information about consumers would be a
ﬁrst and relatively easy step that advertisers could take in order to initiate the
process of (re-)gaining the trust of consumers.

3.3 The Internet of Things as Disruptive
Innovation for the Advertising
Ecosystem
Abstract: The connection of physical and virtual objects via the Internet, the
Internet of Things (IoT), is one of the most up-and-coming technologies in the
digital age. First signs show that the IoT will have a tremendous impact on
the whole advertising ecosystem formed by media, agencies, advertisers, and
the consumer. Analysing early implementations of the IoT in the health and
ﬁtness sector and their impact on the advertising ecosystem, the article shows
fundamental alterations in the information-disinformation relation between the
involved players and subsequently the impact on their business models. It
should also give a guideline for consumers to exploit the new opportunities of
the IoT to communicate with brands and products and to become aware of asso-
ciated threads.
1 Introduction
In recent years the digital age has led to disruptive innovations in several sectors.
Examples are media, telecommunication, and commerce. These innovations
generate new markets and change existing ones radically. As a consequence,
they have a high social impact as the mass production of automobiles had in
the past. They start with weak signals, which are often ignored by established
market leaders, end with a strongly changed market structure and have a much
broader impact than expected in their early years. These disruptive innovations
are mostly initiated and driven by new technologies like the invention of the
steam engine, machines for mass production, or the Internet. For some years
the Internet of Things (IoT), the connection of physical and virtual objects via
the Internet, seems to be one of the most up-and-coming technologies with the
potential to initiate such disruptive innovation in various sectors. In this article
we will analyse how the IoT will transform the whole advertising ecosystem by
bringing new players into the market as well as requiring fundamental changes
in the business models of established market leaders. A special focus will be on
the impact of the information-disinformation relationship on the advertising
ecosystem.

Generally such disruptive innovations begin with the ﬁrst implementations
of the new technology in a well-deﬁned market sector addressing early adopters.
The following article will show this phase with the help of Nike+ as an example
of using the IoT to achieve the aims of advertising such as brand awareness and
customer retention. Due to high adoption rates, technologies which drive a
certain disruptive innovation will later become widespread in a whole sector.
To illustrate this, the impact of implementations of the IoT in the health and
ﬁtness sector will be analysed. Exploring the relationship between the IoT and
top-of-mind awareness, as one of the main elements of business models in the
advertising ecosystem, helps to better understand this impact which leads sub-
sequently to alterations in the information-disinformation relationship between
the players involved, further driving the impact on established business models.
This article should present some ideas and guidelines that explore the new
business opportunities of the IoT as well as how it will alter the business models
of established players in the advertising ecosystem such as media, creative and
media agencies, and advertisers. It should also help raise the awareness of
consumers in understanding the new opportunities as well as the associated
threads of the IoT.
2 Learning from Nike+ as an Early Example of
Using the Internet of Things
2.1 The Beginning of the Internet of Things (IoT) in Advertising
For more than thirty years Nike has been a leading player in global marketing.
The brand stands for leading edge athletic footwear and sportswear. During the
1980’s the main focus of Nike’s advertising campaigns was on iconic world-class
athletes like Michael Jordan. The next step was the ‘Just Do It’ campaign, a ﬁrst
move towards the engagement of target groups, challenging consumers to use
Nike products to achieve their own athletic goals. Thus, Nike became a leader
in engaging consumers long before the rise of social media. In close cooperation
with New York City based agency RG/A Nike opened in 2006 a new chapter in
digital marketing: Nike+.
Nike+ deﬁnes how a brand can build a self-sustaining platform for customers
to track their training progress by inserting a chip in their shoes that connects,
in the early days to their iPod music player, and today to smartphone apps,
smartwatches, and ﬁtness wristbands. Nike+ runners have logged more than
100 million miles within the ﬁrst three years, enough for more than 400 round
trips to the moon. But Nike+ had already enabled the consumer at that time to
184

not only log their training progress but to also share and compare it with mil-
lions of other Nike+ athletes. Thus, the main innovations were implemented:
the IoT by connecting the shoes with the iPod and social media and by oﬀering
an open platform to share own data with other athletes. RG/A’s platform and
related campaigns were pronounced as the ‘campaign of the decade’ and won
the Titanium Lion in Cannes 2009 (Morrissey 2009).
2.2 The Main Disruptive Innovations Linked to Nike+1
But what disruptive innovations (Anthony et al. 2008), from the point of view of
the advertising industry, are linked to Nike+? Firstly, technology is no longer
seen as just a means to implement the creative director’s ‘big idea’ but also as
the source of fresh creativity. The traditional process of brieﬁng by the client,
creative work, and implementing the creative idea by using diﬀerent media
is radically altered. New technologies like the IoT and platforms for sharing
personal content are seen as new opportunities to fulﬁl client’s goals in a totally
new way. As a consequence, and also in agencies, creativity is no longer a
monopoly of the creative department but also stems from the techies and the
marketing people – something that has been common in other industries for
decades.
Secondly, the move from thinking in campaigns to thinking in platforms is
a further disruptive innovation linked to Nike+. An advertising campaign is a
series of advertisement messages that communicate a central theme and message
by using diﬀerent channels such as print, TV, or online across a speciﬁc time
frame, often ranging from six to eight weeks. Thus, most campaigns are short-
lived and try to penetrate the theme and message in a one-way communication
format. On the other hand, platforms are built for years or decades and are im-
proved incrementally. They are used for diﬀerent campaigns and enable two-way
communication between the consumer and brands as well as among consumers.
To build competitive advantages by using digital media, not only is the use of an
existing platform necessary but also to own the technological competencies to
develop innovative platforms as the backbone for campaigns and the engage-
ment of the consumer. Otherwise competitors can do the same things and no
sustainable competitive advantage is generated. Thus, the diﬀerentiation is not
only generated by new ideas but also by new technical artefacts.

their customer communication, and as judge in leading international competitions and awards

As a consequence of the second disruptive innovation, a third is linked
to the example of Nike+: the opportunity and need to bridge storytelling and
systematic design. Storytelling aims to evoke strong emotions, a traditional
core competence of advertising agencies. On the other hand, building platforms
requires systematic design capabilities from the ﬁeld of engineering. Normally,
there is a big gap between these two worlds that require staﬀwith diﬀerent
competencies, mentalities, and working styles. To bring together both in joint
project teams and not falling back to the old model of brieﬁng-creative idea-
implementation, is probably the main challenge for agencies in the world of
the IoT.
The fourth disruptive innovation connected with Nike+ as an example of
using the IoT in advertising is the movement from generating emotional context
by diﬀerent advertising measures to the use of already existing highly emotional
situations of the consumer. Traditional advertising tries to generate emotions by
creative advertising in a low involvement context like reading a newspaper or
watching TV. As shown by Nike+ the exploitation of the IoT takes advantage of
highly emotional context like practicing sport to fulﬁll personal goals. The
advertising tactic is no longer to interrupt the consumer by doing something
he likes to do, like reading an article or watching a movie, but to support what
he really likes to do: logging and sharing his ﬁtness data during a run.
The ﬁrst conclusion from analysing the advertising ecosystem regarding the
impact of digital media in general and the IoT in particular is that we can
observe a strong ongoing transformation process in the whole industry as is
already witnessed in other industries such as media and banking. Digital inno-
vations are changing more and more from an instrument to increase eﬃciency
to the main enabler of new business models. Due to the strongly increased
demand for technological competencies and high aﬃnity to technology driven
business models as well as for new ways of thinking there is an open window
for the market entry of new players. We will discuss this using the example of
the health and ﬁtness sector in the next chapter.
3 The Role of the IoT as a Disruptive Innovation:
the Example of the Health and Fitness Sector
3.1 The IoT’s Characteristics for Disruptive Innovation
Generating new markets and radically changing existing ones are the main char-
acteristics of disruptive innovations. As a consequence, they have a high social
impact. Examples of this are mass production in the automotive industry or the
186
Otto Petrovic

strong spread of smartphones. The driving force of disruptive innovations are
usually players that don’t yet exist, because current market leaders allocate their
resources on hitherto successful business models based on traditional ways of
thinking. Instead of the former market leader, new players enter the market
with a fresh way of thinking, new business models, and without the burden of
past success in an old market environment (Christensen 1997). As a conse-
quence, market leaders for horse-drawn carriages didn’t achieve a relevant role
in the automotive sector and the transformation of the media sector with its
dual-market of public audience and advertising was led by new players like
Google. The IoT already has some of the characteristics of disruptive innovation
and is currently spreading its impact to reach one of the most important criterions
of a disruptive innovation: the strong social impact. The IoT can be deﬁned as a
network of physical objects like devices, vehicles, and buildings among others,
embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity that enables those
objects to collect, store and exchange data. Due to the embedded electronics,
those objects can also be controlled remotely across existing infrastructure like
the Internet (International Telecommunication Union (ITU) 2013). International
Data Corporation (IDC) estimates a growth of the worldwide Internet of Things
market from $655.8 billion in 2014 to $1.7 trillion in 2020 with a compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.9% (MacGillivray, Turner 2015).
A strong social impact of the IoT can be expected, and is already witnessed,
in the sector of health and ﬁtness. The new opportunities of technology together
with people’s altered attitude towards health and ﬁtness leads to a global trend
often called ‘quantiﬁed self’ or ‘self measurement’ (Choe et al. 2014). The basic
idea is that electronic devices such as wristbands, smartwatches, smartphones,
headsets, or chest belts are equipped with sensors that log bodily functions
together with body movement to store, analyse, and share these data. The main
data measured are heart rate, heart rate variability, brainwaves, power on bike
pedals and body movement. From these measurements a lot of data is esti-
mated, such as energy consumption, VO2 max (maximal oxygen uptake), Total
Stress Score, or degree of regeneration. Thus, the quantiﬁed self can be seen as
a further development of the early Nike+ as described above, while the current
version of Nike+ incorporates a number of quantiﬁed self functionalities.
If we look at the main characteristics of this global trend of the quantiﬁed
self we can ﬁnd many of the attributes of disruptive innovation. Firstly, a new
market for self-measurement devices, data analysing, and sharing platforms is
established. In Q4 2015, the shipments of smartwatches, introduced a couple of
years ago, was already higher than for the world-famous Swiss watch manu-
facturer established by Abraham-Louis Breguet in 1775 (Mawston 2/18/2016).
The year-over-year comparison shows for the smartwatch segment an increase
The Internet of Things as Disruptive Innovation for the Advertising Ecosystem
187

of 316% and for shipments of Swiss watches a decrease of 5%. Of course, the
per-item value of one watch is still much higher in the Swiss segment. Showing
the time is just one of many functions of a smartwatch, so as a consequence it’s
not in the same market as traditional watches but is instead building a new one.
Secondly, none of the traditional strong players made this innovation but it was
new companies from a diﬀerent sector. The market leader in the sector for smart-
watches is not a traditional watch brand, but is Apple with a market share
of 65% at the beginning of 2016 (Mawston 2/18/2016). The leading platform to
analyse and share ﬁtness data was also not built by a traditional brand, but by
Runtastic, an Austrian based start-up, acquired by Adidas for 220 million Euros
in 2015. Thirdly, the quantiﬁed self already has a strong social impact. One
example is the movement from the more passive ‘beauty and wellness’ trend
back in the 1980’s towards the emphasis on the active ‘ﬁtness’ engagement.
Another is the rise of more self-responsibility for one’s health than compared to
the past, where delegating decisions to doctors and beliefs in standards set by
traditional authorities such as the WHO dominated.
3.2 Digital Native’s Delphi D-Move Shows First Indicators for a
High Social Impact of the IoT
A high social impact is one of the main characteristics of a disruptive innovation
but to observe this requires long-term empirical studies which deliver insights
only ex-post with limited usefulness for proactive innovation management.
Thus, in this paper the ﬁrst results from an Expert Delphi Study should be pre-
sented to identify early signs of the social impact of the IoT. The Digital Native’s
Delphi ‘D-Move’: (for a detailed description see: Petrovic, Lembeck 2016) is run
on a bi-annual basis. As the participants are recruited every two years from the
same population long-term changes in experts’ opinion and their behaviour can
also be analysed.
The basic assumption of D-Move is that digital natives are early adopters of
digital innovations having grown up in the world of the digital and are closer to
it than their parents’ generation who are digital immigrants. At the same time,
due to their adoption behaviour, they form the innovation environment for com-
panies and individuals bringing those digital innovations to the market. Those
characteristics of the adoption process of the innovation’s early versions inﬂu-
ence its further development and form the social environment for other dis-
ruptive innovations. The relationship between digital innovation and adopter’s
behaviour is not linear but more interdependent and circular. Thus, digital
natives are at the same time the objects and subjects of digital innovations (for
188
Otto Petrovic

a basic elaboration of that dual role of the user see: von Hippel 1986; Rogers
2003).
Therefore the main aim of D-Move is to understand digital natives’ current
behaviour as an indicator for future large-scale transformation processes with a
high social impact. The implementation of D-Move oﬀers four main characteristics:
bring in examples of real world experiences into the Delphi process to explain
one’s own point of view to others, facilitation of interaction with peers, usage
of familiar means of communication, and giving digital natives the role of
experts in the Delphi process. To exploit these four features, a modiﬁed Delphi
method is implemented with face-to-face as well as asynchronous dispersed
forms of communication. The use of the D-Move Field Experience Software further
supports the goals via functions like the capturing and posting of videos, pictures
and textual description from smartphones directly to domain speciﬁc video
blogs in a structural form. Figure 1 shows the main elements of D-Move’s
processes and functionalities.
Bringing in examples of real-world experiences as the ﬁrst characteristic is
achieved by using the Field Experience Module of the D-Move Delphi environment
to explain and support the individual’s position with annotated videos, pictures,
and textual description. This material is collected in an information repository,
mostly in the form of a collaborative video blog. The interaction with peers as
the second characteristic is supported by interaction with other participants in
the Delphi group, for example by discussing the research questions, building
Figure 1: The D-Move Delphi environment and process
The Internet of Things as Disruptive Innovation for the Advertising Ecosystem
189

the Delphi thesis jointly, trying to get more consensual answers, and preparing
the ﬁnal report. The third characteristic, use of familiar forms of communication,
is fulﬁlled by using online questionnaires to answer the Delphi thesis, shared
digital spaces to communicate and share documents within and between the
groups, and the described digital capturing functionalities. Also the interaction
with the review board, which gives methodological advice, is supported by
digital communication. To obtain the fourth characteristic, digital natives take
the role of experts; they are engaged in the development and reﬁnement of
the Delphi thesis in addition to giving their opinions. They can bring in their
real-world expertise as digital natives to improve the quality of D-Move’s outcome.
The aim of D-Move 2016 was to understand whether digital natives are any
diﬀerent to their parents with regards to healthy living and improving ﬁtness
supported by the IoT and quantiﬁed self or if this trend is similar across all
generations. Twenty-ﬁve digital natives as experts for D-Move 2016 were recruited
from a master’s and a bachelor’s class in information systems. The whole process
as shown in ﬁgure 1 took four months. In the ﬁrst step basic assumptions were
discussed by the experts dealing with their own behaviour regarding this trend
by using more open questions. Afterwards, results were aggregated to eight
assumptions in a second step in the form of closed questions.
The two Delphi responses marked in red in Figure 2 show the most homoge-
neous results. They cover the topics of sharing ﬁtness information (central
Figure 2: Sample results of the D-Move Delphi for the domain of health and ﬁtness
190
Otto Petrovic

tendency 5 and variance 0.889) and the usage of quantiﬁed-self-apps (central
tendency 5 and variance 0.598). The digital natives think that they use app-
based ﬁtness programs more than older generations and share the results much
more than their parents.
But at the same time, digital natives think that the trend of health and
ﬁtness has an emergent role in all generations. Particularly when it comes to
awareness and personal responsibility for their own health, participants think
that this is not a question of generations but much more of social stratum and
education. In summary, the results show that health and ﬁtness is a strong
trend, not only within digital natives but across all generations. But the author-
ities setting the standards are quite diﬀerent between digital natives and their
parent’s generation. Digital natives orientate themselves more towards their
peers using social media and increasingly IoT technologies, whereas their parent’s
generation is more strongly oriented towards standards set by traditional author-
ities like the World Health Organization.
These results from D-Move 2016 show the ﬁrst signs that there is already
an on-going social impact of the IoT in such an important ﬁeld as health and
ﬁtness – a main characteristic of a disruptive innovation. Due to this we can
expect further development of the IoT in the ﬁeld of health and ﬁtness and as
a consequence broader adoption in this domain due to the interdependent and
reinforcing relationship of technological innovation and social adoption as dis-
cussed above. As shown in that example sector, there should be a sustainable
impact of the IoT on basic assumptions in the business models of the advertising
ecosystem. The following section discusses these impacts of the IoT with a
special focus on top-of-mind awareness, as one of the most important elements
in the advertising sector’s business models.
4 The Impact of the IoT on Top-of-Mind Awareness
Top-of-mind awareness (TOMA) plays a central role for the diﬀerent business
models in the advertising ecosystem. A brand or product is characterized by a
high TOMA if it comes ﬁrst in consumers’ minds, when thinking of a particular
industry. High TOMA is shown when the brand or product is on the top of
consumers’ relevant set during a multistage buying decision and the probability
is high of preferring that brand or product compared to alternatives within the
relevant set (Karlan et al. 2016). Each player in the traditional advertising eco-
system has a speciﬁc role to support a brand or product by building a strong
TOMA. The creative agency develops messages to strengthen the brand image
and promote sales, the media agency uses diﬀerent media such as the Internet,
The Internet of Things as Disruptive Innovation for the Advertising Ecosystem
191

radio, newspapers, television, magazines, and social media to communicate
those messages and the media companies provide access to the target groups.
As the business models of these players are strongly related to TOMA, any altera-
tion in building and using TOMA would immediately impact them (Petrovic et al.
2015).
4.1 Impact One of the IoT: The Time Frame to Build, Inﬂuence,
and Use the Relevant Set is Shortened or Eliminated
A basic assumption of TOMA is that there is a time gap between recognizing
needs and having the opportunity to make the actual buying decision. Without
this time gap keeping a certain brand for the following buying decision is not
necessary as it is done immediately. An example is the gap between seeing an
advertisement or noticing a need e.g. by looking in the fridge and the actual
buying process at a grocery store. If a wife sees an interesting ad in a news-
paper, she has to note down that she plans to consume that product and ask
her husband to buy it. He has to remember where he put the note before he
next goes shopping, and then, after mastering all these barriers, he will be in
the shop making his ﬁnal buying decision. TOMA is necessary to bridge the gap
from noticing the need to making the buying decision. The wider the gap the
stronger the impact of the ad on TOMA needs to be to fulﬁl the intended top
level position in the consumer’s relevant set. Thus, any alteration of that time
spread will have impact on the role of TOMA and consequently on the business
models of the whole advertising ecosystem.
Impact one of the IoT leads to a shortening or elimination of the time spread
between noticing a certain need and making the buying decision. With ‘Amazon
Fresh’, Amazon oﬀers access to 500,000 grocery products and is from that
perspective already the largest grocery store in the world. To bridge the physical
and the virtual world, Amazon oﬀers its clients the IoT device ‘Amazon Dash’. It
allows scanning of the barcode of any grocery item and putting it automatically
into the shopping basket of Amazon’s eShop. The Amazon Dash Button is a
similar an IoT device. It is Wi-Fi connected and reorders your favourite item
with the press of a button (Amazon 2016). Thus, the buying decision can be
made immediately upon noticing a certain demand, e.g. after eating the last of
the oatmeal in the kitchen. There is no longer a time span between noticing the
need and putting the oatmeal into the shopping basket in the physical grocery
store couple of days later. Due to that elimination of the time span there is no
longer any space to build, inﬂuence, and use the relevant set by means of the
traditional advertising ecosystem.
192
Otto Petrovic

Similar developments can currently be witnessed in the health and ﬁtness
sector. The ﬁtness tracker on the wrist recognizes alterations in heart frequency,
the number of daily steps, walking distance covered, calories burned, or ﬂoors
climbed. Linked with a nutrition app, recommendations for the daily training
schedule together with alterations in nutrition and lifestyle are given. As a
consequence, the time span to build, inﬂuence, and use the relevant set is
shortened or again eliminated. Further examples are an embedded direct link
to a personal coach instead of advertising for a certain ﬁtness centre, the auto-
matic generation of a shopping list for a recommended nutrition strategy instead
of remembering certain brands in one’s relevant set or ﬁnally, the automatic
replenishment of nutrition supplements instead of having to make additional
buying decisions.
This ﬁrst impact of the IoT is used for the same goal that has been pursued
in the traditional advertising system for a long time: to increase customer reten-
tion. But the means are totally diﬀerent. The traditional way is to raise the
amount of advertising to boost top-of-mind and to increase switching costs by
means such as long-time contracts or loyalty programs. On the other hand, the
IoT melds the point of forming a certain want with making the actual buying
decision.
4.2 Impact Two of the IoT: Not Only Humans but also the IoT’s
Machine Algorithm have to be Inﬂuenced
A second basic assumption of the advertising ecosystem is that the relevant set
of people should be inﬂuenced, leading directly to the intended brand awareness
and buying decisions or acting indirectly by impacting on human inﬂuencers.
Figure 3: Amazon Dash Button (Amazon 2016).
The Internet of Things as Disruptive Innovation for the Advertising Ecosystem
193

The IoT also aﬀects that assumption. More and more, the starting point for any
research for a certain buying decision is a generic search with a search engine.
71% of B2B purchasers begin their research with a generic search and more than
half of the decision process is ﬁnished by the time a certain brand is contacted
directly e.g. via its website (Snyder, Hilal 2015). To be highly ranked in the
organic search results of search engines, especially by the market leader Google,
is at least as relevant as being highly ranked in the person’s relevant set. To
improve the ranking in Google’s relevant set is the main aim of the new market
for search engine optimization (SEO) with a lot of specialized agencies. SEO is
quite diﬀerent from search engine marketing (SEM), the use of diﬀerent market-
ing methods based on search engines like Google AdWords. As details about
Google’s search algorithm are secret and often changed by Google, there is a
kind of ‘SEO race’ between specialized agencies to obtain the best rankings
within the organic search results for certain brands and products. Another
strong impact on a person’s TOMA bypassing the traditional advertising system
comes from recommendation engines. Based on algorithms such as collabora-
tive ﬁltering and proﬁling, the consumer gets recommendations for other products
linked to his behaviour in the past and the interests of other consumers with
similar proﬁles. The third area of strong inﬂuence by algorithms on people is
user reviews. The algorithm collects, stores, categorizes, and ﬁlters people’s
reviews and decides whether to oﬀer them to consumers. Thus, user reviews are
a kind of human-to-human inﬂuence but strongly intermediated and inﬂuenced
by a machine algorithm. These three areas strongly cross link humans via
machine algorithm. Specialised service providers like SEO agencies try to
improve client’s top-of-mind position in a machine algorithm like Google with
the main aim of inﬂuencing a client’s customers. That shows how important
the move from traditional advertising to search engine optimization, recommen-
dation engines, and the handling of user reviews is for a sustainable impact on
a person’s TOMA.
Again, the health and ﬁtness sector shows the impact of the IoT on the
traditional advertising sector regarding the rivalry in inﬂuencing the relevant
set. Whereas Nike+ is born with the main aim of increasing customer retention
for an established big brand and heavy advertiser, Strava (2016) is coming
directly from the IoT ﬁeld, with no advertising history and no physical goods to
sell. Thus, the following section shows this example to have, along with Nike+,
both aspects of the IoT’s impact on the advertising sector: the traditional adver-
tiser using more and more IoT technology and the IoT service provider becoming
more and more an inﬂuencer of the advertising ecosystem. Strava is a leading
social network for logging, analysing, and sharing running and bicycle data. It
has more than 1.5 million active users. Its main innovation is to automatically
194
Otto Petrovic

recognize certain parts of a route also logged by others (so called ‘segments’)
and to compare their own performance data with those of others in the same
segment. Strava acts as a platform to connect IoT devices with each other, as
well as directly to runners and cyclists. Increasingly, Strava is also the main
information point for this booming segment in tourism. As a consequence, it
has become a competitor to traditional advertising methods for travel destina-
tions such as brochures, online ads, tourism agencies, or recommendations
given by the host. Each runner or rider can choose their travel destination and
the route for a ride or run based on diﬀerent criteria like weather conditions, ele-
vation gain, road condition, or expected riding or running time. Additionally,
Strava puts the user into a highly emotional environment without the traditional
means of advertising such as movies, pictures, or advertising copy.
4.3 Impact Three of the IoT: A Machine Makes the Buying
Decision
If the person no longer makes the buying decision but the IoT enabled device,
raising TOMA does not concern the relevant set of a human being but that of a
machine. From this perspective, unlike the other impacts, the IoT doesn’t inﬂu-
ence the TOMA of a person, because this TOMA is no longer relevant. Instead,
new forms for ﬁtting into the relevant set of machines need to be developed,
which are quite diﬀerent from traditional advertising.
In the B2B sector, many grocery retailers have already implemented software
that replenishes stock automatically (Myers et al. 2000). These solutions have
been rolled out for many years and are implemented on a large scale. The main
aim is to increase the availability of listed products on the shelf and to reduce
procurement costs. Similar solutions for the B2C sector are still in an experi-
mental phase. One example is LG’s smart fridge. It recognizes stored grocery by
NFC chips or barcodes, makes proposals for recipes based on them, identiﬁes a
food’s expiration date, and makes replenishment decisions. The high potential
of those IoT solutions reveals the estimate that more than 80% of all bought
grocery is purchased just for replenishment2. Another example with huge
possible social impact – the main characteristic of a disruptive innovation – are
self-driving cars like Google’s driverless car or Tesla’s electric cars, the latter
already in regular use on public streets. Today, a lot of decisions by the car
driver are made based on his relevant set. Examples are the selection of a
certain route dependent on actual road conditions and the driver’s personal

195

preferences, stops at a certain gas station to ﬁll up on gas and to buy groceries,
visits to preferred restaurants, or the willingness to drive to a certain store to
buy a special oﬀer advertised in a ﬂyer. The IoT devices make all those decisions
in a driverless car autonomously. Thus, as in the case of automatic replenish-
ment, the main aim should be to ﬁt into the relevant set of those IoT enabled
devices. As a consequence, product development may become the most impor-
tant aspect of market communication, as more and more communication tasks
are transferred from the marketing department to certain functions of IoT
devices.
Those three impacts of the IoT on the advertising system shown above can
lead to sustainable change in the advertising sector, mainly based on changes
in basic assumptions and elements of current business models of its player.
The following chapter will analyse which changes in business models can be
expected or are already witnessed due to impact of the IoT on the information-
disinformation relation of the players in the advertising ecosystem.
5 The Impact of the IoT on the Information-
Disinformation Relation in the Advertising
Ecosystem
The following section shows changes in the information-disinformation relation-
ship between the main players in the advertising ecosystem caused by the
IoT. For this purpose, we understand disinformation as intentionally false or
inaccurate information that is spread deliberately. Under this term we sum-
marize traditional propaganda techniques to obtain certain emotional reactions
as well as disinformation used to manipulate the audience at the rational level
by either discrediting conﬂicting information or supporting false conclusions.
Disinformation is often generated by mixing some truth and observation with
false conclusions and lies. Another technique is to hide facts when channels of
information cannot be completely closed or to make them useless by ﬁlling
them with disinformation (Stahl 2006).
Figure 3 illustrates the main information-disinformation ﬂows in the adver-
tising ecosystem together with changes due to the implementation of IoT devices.
It shows that the impact of the IoT is much broader and stronger, as well as
much more complex, than privacy concerns on the consumer side that have
been emphasized in scientiﬁc and popular publications and discussions in the
last few years (for this discussion see: Groopman 2015).
196
Otto Petrovic

5.1 The Consumer-Media Relationship
The main information ﬂow from traditional media to the consumer includes fact-
based information and entertainment, sometimes inseparably mixed. The infor-
mation ﬂow in the other direction, from the consumer to the media, is twofold.
Firstly, usage of the media and attention to its content determines media data
such as reach or characteristics of the audiences and is the basis for the value
of the media on the advertising market. The second information ﬂow includes
consumer’s personal preferences and behaviour, an information ﬂow which
strongly gained importance during the last years.
The use of media by IoT enabled devices, like smartwatches, tablets, or
interactive TV, enables a much more accurate measurement of what content is
used for what purposes at what time and at what location. As these devices are
often very personal appliances, the mapping between its usage and a certain
person can also be made. As a consequence, the media company has much
Figure 4: The impact of the IoT on the information-disinformation relationship in the advertising
ecosystem
The Internet of Things as Disruptive Innovation for the Advertising Ecosystem
197

more accurate information about real consumer behaviour than in the tradi-
tional advertisement world, with copy tests as a part of marketing research. At
the same time, the advertisers as clients of the media can use those data without
any manipulation in real time. This direct connection eliminates inherent failures
of traditional measurement methods like certain kinds of bias linked to copy tests
as well as giving the opportunity to manipulate data about consumer behaviour
by holding back certain data or manipulating data to increase the value of the
media in the advertising market. Thus, on the one hand IoT devices can deliver
more accurate data than traditional audience research due to direct measure-
ment of real audience behaviour instead of conducting surveys. On the other
hand, this direct measurement also has embedded limitations, mostly due to
the use of IP addresses as an identiﬁer, such as the diﬀerence between visits,
unique visitors, and unique clients. But these limitations are well known and
transparent and a lot of eﬀort is invested to overcome them by elaborate methods
of user research based on the observation of their recorded footprints in the
digital world. Of course, there is an immanent trade-oﬀbetween user research
and privacy issues.
This enhanced information about consumer preferences and behaviour allows
the media a much more personalized oﬀer of information and entertainment content.
It can be delivered via awareness of consumer’s current location, the time of
day, the device used, and personal preferences. This is possible with sophisti-
cated customer insight techniques together with the option to divide digital
data in small packages and reconﬁgure and distribute them as a function of
consumer needs. Thus the greatly increased availability of information about
the consumer gives media and advertisers a much better orientation on real
customer needs and can also be used in conﬂict with consumer’s privacy
concerns (for a discussion of the security and privacy issues linked to the IoT
see: Federal Trade Commission 2015) (see chapter 3.2 on the legal and ethical
aspects of collecting and using information about consumers).
5.2 The Consumer-Advertiser Relationship
The information ﬂow from the consumer to the advertiser is mainly based on the
consumer’s attitude, behaviour, and preferences in the form of brand awareness
and buying of a certain product or service in relation to certain measures by
the advertiser. Those measures include oﬀering the consumer information on
the beneﬁts and competitive advantages of the product or service and creating
emotional environments for the advertiser’s branding aims. The main source for
disinformation for the customer is to build brand and product images that are
far removed from the real product properties.
198
Otto Petrovic

Using IoT enabled devices the advertiser can recognize highly emotional
situations of the consumer without any time delay. Examples are ﬁtness trackers
carried by the user 24 hours a day. Collecting data like GPS-based location, heart
rate, or more advanced brain activities, the advertiser can recognize and use
activities of the consumer with highly emotional engagement in real time and
can use them for his aims instead of creating new ones in the traditional way
through art work, advertising copy, and stories. An example in the ﬁeld of
health and ﬁtness are diﬀerent performance awards granted immediately after
a bike ride linked to the advertiser’s brand. Of course, due to the high proximity
of any activity by the advertiser to the privacy of the consumer, much more
orientation on real customer wants and needs is necessary before doing e.g.
outdoor advertising. Context awareness can also be used to communicate the
beneﬁts of a product or service. For example, the smartwatch can propose a
certain nutrition supplement linked to the morning run when the consumer
enters a grocery store. Due to the increase in the advertiser’s information about
the consumer’s actual context, he can strongly reduce the amount of inappro-
priate messages in regards to content as well as location and time where it is
oﬀered. On the other hand, while information from the advertiser may have
more impact on consumer’s attitudes and actions, disinformation can also inﬂu-
ence the consumer more directly and immediately – at least for a certain period
in the relationship between the consumer and advertiser until the consumer
recognizes it.
There is also a strong impact of IoT enabled devices on the information-
disinformation balance in the information ﬂow from the consumer to the adver-
tiser. Firstly, the consumer’s willingness to unfold and share personal preferences
is much higher when this is closely linked to an instant beneﬁt in using the
product rather than just ﬁlling out a questionnaire or giving an interview.
Secondly, measurement of consumer’s real reaction to advertising measures
regarding brand awareness and buying behaviour by tracking functionalities
embedded in IoT enabled devices, allows for skipping any intended or un-
intended disinformation from traditional media or agencies.
5.3 The Media-Advertiser Relationship
The main function of media in this relationship is to oﬀer advertisers access
to their target audience. Access means to enable an information ﬂow between
the advertiser and the consumer to draw consumer’s attention and to generate
information about his behaviour and preferences. From an ethical point of view
not so desirable but nevertheless something necessary to establish is the rela-
tionship between coverage of the media about a certain advertiser and the
The Internet of Things as Disruptive Innovation for the Advertising Ecosystem
199

advertising buying behaviour of that advertiser. Consequently, the information
ﬂow between the media and the consumer is inﬂuenced by the behaviour of the
advertiser. In the other direction, advertisers deliver information about their
products and services in the form of ads and emotional content for branding
aims, both of which are potentially valuable content for the media.
One of the most disruptive innovations in the world of digital is the ability
of brands to own and control their own media or at least to have direct real-time
access to media used by the consumer. If we look at the example of Nike+ given
above, we see that the digital platform developed by Nike is huge with high
reach, clearly directed at Nike’s target group and with very low wastage. The
costs for designing, developing and using this platform are at least partly at the
expense of advertising in the traditional media. As it is operated by the brand
themselves, no disinformation about reach, target group, consumer behaviour
and other performance information between media and the brand is possible,
resulting in more accurate performance. On the other hand, if the brand owns
the media, a relationship between content oﬀered and the interests of the
brand does not surprise the consumer. But there are some exceptions. A well-
documented example is the car recommendation portal for an automotive
company, which also proposes competitors’ cars if they best fulﬁl a certain
consumer need. The aim is to build as high of a degree of consumer trust as
traditional media try to do (Urban, Hauser 2004). The information ﬂow from the
advertiser to the media is no longer limited to content in the form of artwork or
advertising copy but also includes features of the product and service to ad value
on the media’s platform. An example is a feature to measure one’s own daily
calorie consumption embedded in the content of the media with an application
oﬀered by the advertiser from the health and ﬁtness sector.
5.4 The Media-Agency Relationship
The information ﬂow from agencies to the media is twofold. Firstly, creative
agencies develop advertising media and have to specify technical production
data e.g. for printing. In the digital world, these data are much more complex
due to a range of diﬀerent devices and software used to consume the media.
An example is an interactive banner ad where speciﬁcations for supported
browsers, responsive design characteristics, or supported scripts for interactive
features have to be agreed upon between the agency and the media. Secondly,
media agencies have to specify format, placement and frequency, or in case of TV
spots, the time of day to best reach their target group. In the reverse direction,
from media to agency, there are important information ﬂows before, during, and
after the execution of a campaign. Before execution, the media inform the agency
200
Otto Petrovic

about media data like circulation, reach, or characteristics of the audience. These
data are relevant for the booking decision according to the media plan. During
execution, data like actual circulation, posted bills, or page impression for a certain
banner ad are communicated. After execution, data on campaign performance
and user behaviour are very important for the agency.
The IoT alters the information between the media and the agency. Due to
the high technical complexity of the IoT devices and their close integration
with media platforms the information ﬂow is bidirectional and more like an
agreement between the media and the agency to obtain maximal performance
rather than standards given by the media. The information on format, place-
ment, or frequency can be changed by the agency during execution in real time
instead of being tied to a contract before execution in the traditional advertising
world. The consequence is an increasing risk of disinformation in the case of
problems in execution such as the high loading time of banner ads or late or
incorrect changes in format or placement. The impact of the IoT on information
ﬂow from the media to the agency is twofold. As a consequence, data from
digital platforms, such as all media data and actual data of execution, perfor-
mance, and consumer behaviour are measured and stored in server repositories,
which can also be used directly by the agency in real time. Thus, the risk of
disinformation due to the bias of participants in copy tests or of the media to
obtain more value on the advertising market is reduced. The opportunity to
obtain more accurate information on media data, actual execution, performance,
and consumer behaviour is further strengthened in the case of access to the
consumer’s IoT devices directly by the agency. If all server requests of the IoT
device, for example storing a run on a smartwatch, is rerouted ﬁrst to the agency
and then forwarded on to the media’s platform, the agency can double check the
information transferred by the media.
5.5 The Agency-Advertiser Relationship
The information ﬂow from the advertiser to the agency mainly covers the brieﬁng.
This includes the creative brief based on brand values and corporate design as
well as performance aims like brand image or an increase in sales. The informa-
tion ﬂow from agencies to advertisers is linked to creative work to obtain adver-
tisers goals and to develop and implement an appropriate media plan. Another
information ﬂow from the agency to the advertiser that has strengthened in
importance in the last few years is twofold. Firstly, information about the perfor-
mance of the campaign closely related to business aims and secondly, consumer
data on behaviour and preferences.
The Internet of Things as Disruptive Innovation for the Advertising Ecosystem
201

The information ﬂow from the advertiser to the agency is altered in the IoT
world. Due to the increasing complexity of advertised products and services as
well as to the plurality of advertising media and other channels to reach the
consumer, traditional campaign planning and execution can be rarely done by
following the traditional process of brief/creative work/re-brieﬁng/execution.
Instead, agile project management with close cooperation between advertiser
and agency, beginning with the development of a rough brieﬁng and including
all working steps is necessary. Thus, there is an ongoing information ﬂow
modifying the brieﬁng during the whole campaign cycle, which requires a lot
of changes in thinking and doing on behalf of all participants.
In the world of the IoT the creative agency’s work plays a less important role
in the ﬁeld of advertising copy and art design than in the area of functionalities of
the IoT application. This requires deep knowledge about technical characteristics
and standards of the IoT platform that acts as the media and oﬀers access to
the target audience. The owner and/or operator of the IoT platform has better
information about the framework conditions for designing IoT applications
than the creative agency and can oﬀer its services directly to the advertiser.
Often the platform is even operated directly by the brand and the agency’s
work is limited or totally eliminated. Also the information ﬂow starting from
the media agencies is undermined by digital media in general and IoT platforms
in particular. Due to the high market concentration of digital media, certain play-
ers like Google cannot be bypassed by media agencies. As a consequence, if a
campaign uses media much less than in the traditional world, media planning
and performance measurement can be done directly by the media or the
advertiser themselves. This tendency is further enforced by the increasing ability
of IoT devices to do the ‘advertising’ with their own embedded functionalities
like viral dissemination of messages within their own peers. The capability to
capture consumer data directly by advertiser-controlled devices and platforms
makes data generated by the media and edited by agencies in the past increas-
ingly just to a small part of the available consumer data. Thus advertisers
will perform the business analytics work in-house more often or together with
external specialists. This means that the media agency’s work is limited or
carried out by others and any opportunities for disinformation are also eliminated
due to the direct linkage between the media and the advertiser.
6 Conclusion and Further Research Work
The Internet of Things (IoT) has many of the characteristics of a disruptive inno-
vation. It generates new markets and changes existing ones radically and, most
202
Otto Petrovic

importantly; it has the same high social impact like mass production in the
automotive industry or the spread of smartphones. In the past, new players
entered the market with a fresh way of thinking and new business models and
they became the driving force, as they utilized the disruptive innovation much
better than the former market leader. Currently, we can already witness the
consequences of the IoT in the ﬁeld of health and ﬁtness with the strong social
impact of IoT devices such as smartphones, ﬁtness trackers, or heart rate monitors.
The impact of the IoT on the advertising ecosystem could be much more far-
reaching and sustainable than currently discussed with a strong focus on
consumer’s privacy in particular (see chapter 3.2 on the legal and ethical aspects
of collecting and using information about consumers). Due to massive changes
in the information-disinformation balance, traditional media, agencies, and brands
have to change their business models and – much more challenging – their
competencies and mind-sets.
The IoT’s impact is most obvious in established mechanisms to build top-of-
mind awareness (TOMA) and the relevant set as the basis for buying decisions.
In particular, the current business models of traditional media and agencies are
built around measures to increase TOMA for brands. Thus, a change of their
linked mechanism hits these notably hard. IoT devices like the Amazon Dash
Button enable the consumer to place an order immediately after recognizing
the demand – shortening or eliminating the time span required to build and
use TOMA. The human TOMA and the linked buying decision are increasingly
inﬂuenced by the machine algorithms used in search engines. To compete in
the ‘SEO race’, brands and their partners have to not only inﬂuence humans but
also machines. If a machine makes decisions autonomously, like refrigerators
with built-in self-replenishment functions or self-driving cars, the challenge is
to optimize a machine’s TOMA.
Due to changes in the information-disinformation balance between con-
sumer, traditional media, agencies, and brands, further impact of the IoT on
the advertising ecosystem can be expected or is already witnessed. The operator
of the IoT platform carries over former value propositions from traditional media
like reach in the target group with low wastage. At the same time he oﬀers
services like performance measurement directly to the advertiser. An example
is the use of Google Analytics to analyse the impact of campaigns directly by
the brand/advertiser in real time. The consequence is a much stronger direct
linkage between the IoT platform and the brand/advertiser, increasingly skipping
creative and media agencies as well as traditional media. Both not only suﬀer from
a shifting advertising budget towards digital platforms but also from the fact
that brands as former advertising clients will increasingly build and operate
their own platforms which carry out the value propositions of traditional media,
The Internet of Things as Disruptive Innovation for the Advertising Ecosystem
203

among others, and can obtain more reach and less wastage than traditional
media. In addition, the linkage between brands and consumers, enabled by IoT
devices, is encouraged. This is not only obtained by strong digital platforms
operated by the brand but also by communication features as part of the
product/service as shown by Strava’s or Garmin’s IoT platforms. Thus, product
development, especially specifying features, formerly a role of the traditional
advertising system, could become the most important aspect of customer com-
munication in the future.
One important further research aim is to foster empirical work on the topics
presented in this paper. That could not only be done by using surveys as in the
past but to a greater extent through observations utilizing the fact that con-
sumers leave their footprints in the digital world automatically. Using this data,
taking into consideration legal regulations of course, can provide many more
insights into real consumer behaviour and demands. Identifying lead users or
early adopters using means like social network analysis or Delphi studies with
digital natives as experts will bring new insights into this very dynamic research
ﬁeld.

IV Inclusion of Users in the Creation of Advertising


Chris Miles
4.1 The Rhetoric of Marketing Co-creation
Abstract: Co-creation, the idea that brands should work with consumers and
other stakeholders as equal partners in order to collaboratively generate ideas
about what they produce and how they should market it, appears to be currently
enjoying an enthusiastic reception amongst marketing academics and practi-
tioners. This chapter looks critically at the evolution of the idea of co-creation
in marketing thought and practice by closely reading the texts that have pro-
vided the foundational thinking behind the perspective as well as investigating
the way in which practitioners talk about its adoption and implementation. This
exploration highlights serious tensions between traditional marketing’s desire
for control over consumers and co-creation’s apparent surrender of control to
them. Yet, these tensions are shown to be largely rhetorical in nature, serving
to strategically position a ‘new’ egalitarian marketing that relies just as much
upon the traditional marketing control-orientation as the old approach it has
‘Othered’. Co-creation, therefore, can be viewed as a form of disinformation
that aids marketing in misdirecting attention away from its moribund state and
resulting crisis of relevancy.
The idea of co-creation is currently enjoying an ascendancy. Marketing practi-
tioners have become obsessed with enlisting the creative eﬀorts of consumers
to provide content for their advertising campaigns and social network channels
(Andrejevic 2011; Campbell et al. 2011; Fisher, Smith 2011; Kozinets et al. 2008).
Consumer-generated reviews on Amazon.com, IMDB.com, Yelp.com, and eBay.
com provide trust, insight, entertainment, and guidance that add signiﬁcant
value to these enterprises while ‘crowdfunding’ sites such as Kickstarter.com
and Patreon.com aim to bring consumers more deeply inside the brand creation
process than ever before. Such apparent collaborations between brands and
consumers seem to be in marked contrast to the more traditional marketing
dynamic of dictating value to consumers – laying your wares out in front of
them and then persuading them to buy.
At the same time as marketing practice has been integrating consumer work
into the brand creation process, academic marketing has been providing the
theoretical foundations for the ascendancy of consumer creativity in contem-
porary business. Two academic discourse streams in particular can be seen to
be the ﬂash points for such research. Prahalad and Ramaswamy’s (Prahalad,
Ramaswamy 2004) study of the “Future of Competition” is subtitled “Co-Creating

Unique Value with Customers” and the DART model that they advance outlines
the “basic building blocks of co-creation” between consumer and company.
More directly in the academic marketing camp, Vargo and Lusch (Vargo, Lusch
2004) introduce the Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic), a summation of
perspectives that they argue have been evolving in marketing research over the
previous decades. One of these perspectives revolves around the idea of the co-
creation of value and it is given a signiﬁcant place in their eight “foundational
premises” of S-D Logic (2004, p. 6). The inﬂuence that Vargo and Lusch’s view of
the evolution of marketing discourse has had is considerable, generating a large
amount of conferences, papers, journal special editions, and citations. That their
formulation of the S-D Logic paradigm places such emphasis on the co-creation
of value is a striking example of academic marketing proto-theory seemingly
moving in tandem with marketing practice.
In this chapter I wish to interrogate the way in which the idea of co-creation
has taken root in the discourses of marketing practitioners and marketing aca-
demics. I will argue that the discursive construction of ‘co-creation’ is a rhetorical
strategy employed by both practitioners and academics in response to the em-
powerment of online, constantly-communicating, networked consumers which
has threatened the eﬀectiveness and identity of traditional marketing manage-
ment approaches to consumer control. I hope to show that what is positioned
as egalitarian, inclusive, and revolutionary is still deeply entangled in the
control-oriented paradigm of traditional marketing. Consequently, the literature
and practice around co-creation can be seen as a form of disinformation,
designed to reassure clients and consumers that marketing has changed, evolved,
stepped-up to the challenge of interactive, networked communication while in
fact helping to disguise the fact that nothing much has changed at all. Cleverly,
the central persuasive strategy that this campaign of disinformation rests upon
is the characterization of traditional marketing communication methods as
manipulative disinformation. As I will show, this ‘Othering’ serves to distract
attention away from the continuing control orientation that is at the heart of
contemporary marketing.
I will begin by outlining the roots of co-creation in the marketing literature,
leading on to a more detailed investigation of Prahalad and Ramaswamy’s
(2004) DART model of business strategy and Vargo and Lusch’s (2004) deﬁnition
of the Service-Dominant Logic perspective to marketing. Next, I will examine
the ways in which marketing practitioners are discussing co-creation tactics,
demonstrating the ways in which the profession of marketing has used co-
creation and co-production strategies as rhetorical gambits to give the appearance
of egalitarian acceptance of consumer empowerment and entitlement whilst in
fact constructing campaigns and communications policies which continue to be
210
Chris Miles

focused around the hunt for control over consumers. Finally, I will conclude
with a consideration of the inherent paradox in marketing’s instrumentalisation
of consumer co-creation.
1 The Roots of Co-creation in Marketing Theory
Academic engagement with the ideas behind the co-creation of value can be
said to originate in the broader recognition emerging from the relationship and
service marketing schools that consumers should be treated as long-term partners
in mutually-beneﬁcial relationships rather than targets of manipulative disinfor-
mation for short-term gain (Grönroos 1994; Svensson, Grönroos 2008; Ravald,
Grönroos 1996). Part of this perspective includes a call for a move towards
dialogic theories of marketing communication which emphasise exploratory
conversation between equals rather than monological persuasive strategies
(Grönroos 2000; Ballantyne 2004; Varey 2000).
Against this background, we can locate the initial investigations of the idea
of the co-creation of value in two principal sources; the work of Peppers and
Rogers (1993) and Normann and Ramirez (1993). Both sets of authors argue that
“collaboration” with customers (in the case of Peppers & Rogers) or “coproduc-
tion” with them (in the case of Normann and Ramirez) is an essential tool of
value creation for modern ﬁrms. Both also argue that constructions of value
can no longer be imposed upon the customer. Instead, the goal of the ﬁrm “is
not to create value for customers but to mobilize customers to create their own
value from the company’s various oﬀerings” (Normann, Ramírez 1993, p. 69).
Additionally, both argue that their perspectives emerged from a realization that
the old product-oriented value chain paradigms were unequal to describing the
reality of vocal, empowered, and demanding consumers who see themselves as
the center of the value creation process. Indeed, Ramirez (1999), in a slightly
later solo study, argues that the coproduction of value framework has in fact
been available to us intellectually “for some 300 years” (1999, pp. 49–50), but
only recently has technology “liberate[d] us from the constraints of the indus-
trial mode of value creation and its conceptualizations” allowing us to “consider
value creation as synchronic and interactive, not linear and transitive” (1999,
p. 50). In this sense, although both Peppers and Rogers (1993) and Normann
and Ramirez (1993) outlined their approaches before the full commercialisation
of the Internet, it is clear that the interactivity which is fundamental to the
hypermedia computer-mediated environment of the Web would be a pivotal
enabling technology in the widespread uptake of the idea of the collaborative
coproduction of value.
The Rhetoric of Marketing Co-creation
211

Just before the millennium, Kambil et al. (1999) came up with the name that
would stick. Their paper, published in the house journal of consultancy ﬁrm
Accenture, uses a series of persuasive examples from manufacturers such as
IKEA, Fiat, Dell, and Red Hat to demonstrate how ﬁrms were “partnering with
their customers to co-create value” (p. 38). In straightforward terms, the authors
describe how “seeing customers as partners in the creation of value widens the
horizons of companies entering the eEconomy”, providing ways for ﬁrms to
expand their “intellectual property and relationship assets” via customer involve-
ment as well as potentially providing “lock in” of customers into their products
or services (p. 43). Prahalad and Ramaswamy’s (2000) paper in the Harvard
Business Review also describes customers as “cocreators of value” as part of
their overview of how companies should begin to see customers “as a source
of competence” (p. 81), which “is a function of the knowledge and skills they
possess, their willingness to learn and experiment, and their ability to engage
in an active dialogue” (p. 80). Finally, Thomke and von Hippel (2002) provide a
slightly diﬀerent spin (while using a similar set of examples) in another Harvard
Business Review article that illustrates how some companies were managing
to collapse the traditionally cumbersome and time-consuming R&D process
by casting customers as innovators, abandoning “their eﬀorts to understand
exactly what products their customers want” and instead equipping them “with
tools to design and develop their own products” (p. 5).
The studies above serve as the bedrock for the two pieces of work that have
really cemented the co-creation of value at the foundations of contemporary
academic marketing approaches to value – Prahalad and Ramaswamy’s (2004)
book-length study of the DART model, and Vargo and Lusch’s (2004) article
introducing the Service-Dominant Logic.
2 The DART Perspective
Prahalad and Ramaswamy’s exposition of the DART model (“dialogue, access,
risk assessment, and transparency”, (2004, p. 23)) is a strong argument for the
centrality of co-creation in any “search for new strategic capital” (2004, xi).
They state that the role of the customer has changed “from isolated to con-
nected, from unaware to informed, from passive to active” (2004, p. 2). The
language here is telling – an isolated customer is a vulnerable one, an unaware
customer is one who will believe your disinformation because they know no
better, and a passive customer is easily manipulated, simply lead. Prahalad
and Ramaswamy are reminding their readers of the good old days when their
customers were ripe for the picking while at the same time calling their attention
212
Chris Miles

to the reality of the new, powerful, engaged consumer who they will not be able
to treat in the usual way. The rhetorical gambit is clear: to convince the business
reader of the necessity of your solution you ﬁrst need to get them worried and to
do this you paint a picture of the consumer as out of their control. As Prahalad
and Ramaswamy make clear, businesses have traditionally been able to manage
the consumer. So, they are “accustomed to restricting the ﬂow of information
to consumers” (2004, p. 2), used to being free to “vary the price or quality of
products from one location to another” (2004, p. 3). Their marketing communica-
tion has been premised upon the “traditional top-down pattern” where “claimed
beneﬁts” aﬀected demand rather than customer word-of-mouth. Yet, now we
have consumers who can talk to each other, research products across national
and linguistic borders, and “as they network, they embolden each other to act
and speak out” (2004, p. 4). The language is alarmist because that is how the
authors seek to control the attention of their time-poor audience who have heard
the call for change many times before. It is also alarmist because the authors
know that the strategies they will outline are really very uncomfortable for
the traditional manager, used to doing their jobs with “little or no interference
from customers” (2004, p. 5). If they are to persuade businesses to adopt such
diﬃcult changes in managerial attitudes and practices then the danger of not
changing needs to be made as vivid as possible.
The move to “an individual-centered co-creation of value between consumers
and companies” (2004, p. 12) demands that ﬁrms stop seeing value as something
that is dictated to consumers. Prahalad and Ramaswamy’s DART model codiﬁes
the essential building blocks that a ﬁrm needs in order to successfully adopt the
new co-creation of value paradigm. Each one of the elements reﬂects the radically
new power structure unfolding in the contemporary market. Instead of customiz-
ing “to suit the company’s supply chain”, the ﬁrm must satisfy “a consumer’s
unique desires and preferences” (2004, p. 89). Instead of locating quality in
“what the ﬁrm has to oﬀer” the enterprise must realize that quality is estab-
lished in “consumer-company interactions and co-creation experiences” (2004,
p. 50). Instead of talking at consumers, ﬁrms must see communication as a
“shared learning” process “between two equal problem solvers” (2004, p. 23).
Instead of hiding risks to customers the enterprise needs to be full and honest
with consumers, allowing them to judge for themselves the “trade-oﬀbetween
risks and beneﬁts” (2004, p. 27).
Such radical changes in paradigm are called for because of the “new realities”
facing businesses today (2004, p. 241). These are not, in other words, theoretical
or idealistic concerns – for the authors, “perhaps the single most important shift
that companies and managers must make is to recognize the centrality of
the individual” (2004, p. 237). The modern business network can no longer be

viewed as a matrix of institutionalised interests, segments and aggregations,
but is instead a “nodal network” of individuals (2004, p. 238). Prahalad and
Ramaswamy’s exposition of co-creation is, throughout, couched in revolutionary
terms. Indeed, it ﬁnishes with a vision of co-creation ultimately ushering in “the
emergence of a truly democratic global society in which human rights, needs,
and values are predominant – not the demands of institutions” (2004, p. 238).
Businesses can share in the co-creation of such a future if they attend carefully
to the principals of the DART model.
Prahalad and Ramaswamy present the co-creation of value as a necessity for
the evolving business. Throughout their work, in tables, diagrams and exposi-
tion, they constantly contrast aspects of the “traditional theory of the ﬁrm”
with those of the new, “emerging reality” (2004, p. 238). As already seen, they
present traditional strategies as manipulative, controlling, and based upon an
assumed inequality. Yet, while presented using negative and critical language,
this is not enough to make the reader recognise the inadvisability of such
practices. Instead, Prahalad and Ramaswamy need to make it clear that this
approach to dealing with customers will no longer work. So, the argument is
not initially an ethical one at all – it is a practical one. Customers will no longer
be manipulated, they can no longer be spoken at, and you will not be able
to hide information from them. Co-creation of value is a strategic response to a
re-balancing of power. While the ﬁnal moments of their study ﬁnd Prahalad and
Ramaswamy in humanitarian, universalist visionary mode, the bulk of the book
uses two principle forms of argumentation; inculcating fear in the manager-
reader at the prospect of enlightened, powerful customers and then using a
large number of examples of companies which have used co-creative practices
to succeed. These case studies act as the carrot to the stick of the portrait of the
evolved customer and are collected from across many diﬀerent industries from
cosmetics to automobiles and from farming equipment to fashion retail. The
majority are not in-depth analytic studies, however, but quick descriptions of
how the ﬁrm in question uses one aspect of one of the DART components
to achieve some form of diﬀerentiation or disruption. The heaping up of such
‘nutshell’ narratives constructs the impression that everyone but the reader is
already implementing this new approach. The visionary ending to Prahalad
and Ramaswamy’s book provides yet another argument for the necessity of the
co-creative paradigm; not only is it the only way to connect with the evolved
customer, and not only is it a strategy that has already been adopted by
thought-leading successful ﬁrms, but it is also a recipe for how businesses can
contribute to a freer, more democratic tomorrow. And how could any manager
not want to be responsible for a freer and more democratic tomorrow? In a tell-
ing sentence from the book’s ﬁnal page, the authors state that co-creation can

“help to create a new basis for the social legitimacy of all large institutions in
our society” (2004, p. 238).
3 The S-D Logic Perspective
Unlike Prahalad and Ramaswamy’s (2004) study, which is aimed at an audience
of enlightened business readers, Vargo and Lusch’s (2004) article for the Journal
of Marketing is constructed for a more strictly academic readership. However,
there are striking similarities in the rhetorical and argumentative strategies that
both sets of authors use. This, in turn, suggests that the value of the co-creation
of value concept might be being constructed from similar motivations across
these two sources and audiences.
Vargo and Lusch’s (2004) article has around 7390 citations indexed on
Google Scholar at the time of writing. This is an astounding number of citations
for a single article in the academic marketing ﬁeld and gives an indication of the
considerable inﬂuence the paper has had in (what is in academic terms) such a
short time. Its reception amongst marketing academics has gone a long way to
habituating this audience to the co-creation of value concept. As I have argued
elsewhere (Miles 2014), Vargo and Lusch’s article is a carefully constructed
persuasive document. It falls into two major parts – an initial historical overview
of the development of marketing theory and then an exposition of what the
authors call the eight “foundational premises” of the new emerging logic that
they identify in recent marketing research. The historical overview is, like any
other historical overview, a carefully constructed narrative designed to lead the
reader to a particular conclusion. This conclusion is that marketing has evolved
over the years in distinct steps. This was important for the original audience of
the 2004 paper because in the 1980s and 1990s marketing theory seemed to
have devolved into a series of (sometimes adversarial) splinter groups with little
sense of common purpose – any overall evolution of the discipline had appeared
to stop. Emphasising the sequential movement from one paradigm of marketing
to another in their historical overview constructs an expectation that marketing
needs to continue in this way – it generates a feeling of inevitability. This prepares
the way for the principal argument of the paper, namely that where we had before
seen chaos and disagreement there was in fact, right beneath our noses, harmony
and unity. Vargo and Lusch (2004) point out that the 1980s and 1990s in fact
contain many voices saying the same things with diﬀerent terminologies and, if
only we were to stop and consider their common assumptions, we would ﬁnd
that there is an emerging “dominant logic” behind these voices, that can “unify
The Rhetoric of Marketing Co-creation
215

disparate literature streams in major areas such as customer and market orien-
tation, services marketing, relationship marketing, quality management, value
and supply chain management, resource management, and network analysis”
(2004, p. 3). So, the emerging logic that the authors will delineate in the second
half of the paper is presented as a salvation to the perception of late-twentieth
century marketing as constituted by alarmingly “fragmented thought, questions
about the future of marketing, calls for a paradigm shift, and controversies
over services marketing being a distinct area of study” (2004, p. 1). Using the
rhetorical framing of Darwinian evolution and Kuhnian paradigm shifts, Vargo
and Lusch construct a narrative that appeals to marketing academics concerned
at the moribund state of their discipline – the apparent discovery of the next
stage of marketing evolution allows us to breathe a great sigh of relief. In this
sense, Vargo and Lusch’s Service-Dominant Logic is presented in a very similar
manner to Prahalad and Ramaswamy’s DART model – the audience is ﬁrst
reminded of how bad things have become for them and then they are handed
their salvation. Let us now look at the place that co-creation plays within this
new emerging logic.
The sixth “foundational premise” of the new logic is “the customer is always
a coproducer” (2004, p. 10). Vargo and Lusch point out that “in using a product,
the customer is continuing the marketing, consumption, and value-creation and
delivery processes” (2004, p. 11). It is, therefore, unreasonable for the ﬁrm to
act as if they construct and ﬁx value – the value-in-use experienced (indeed,
produced) by the user is just as, if not more, important. As they further note,
“the customer becomes primarily an operant resource (coproducer) rather than
an operand resource (‘target’) and can be involved in the entire value and
service chain in acting upon operand resources” (2004, p. 11). Certainly the
promotion of customers from targets to coproducers is a good example of the
way in which marketing theorists have integrated the apparent empowerment
of networked customers into new vocabularies of egalitarianism. On the other
hand, the extension of the terminology of ‘resources’ to include the customer
threatens to place them in a passive (done to) and manipulated position which
is in opposition to such egalitarianism. The distinction between operant and
operand resources is central to the S-D Logic framework. Operand resources are
the focus of traditional marketing – they are resources “on which an operation
or act is performed” (2004, p. 4). Operant resources are resources “that produce
eﬀects” (ibid.) and are the primary focus of the new service perspective in
marketing. Examples of operant resources are knowledge and skills. Accord-
ingly, Vargo and Lusch see both employees and customers as operant resources
who will help the enterprise “to make better value propositions than its com-
petitors” (2004, p. 5). There is a certain awkwardness in Vargo and Lusch
216
Chris Miles

continuing to use the very concept of resources, though. If employees and
consumers are resources they are still resources used by the enterprise. While
they might be formulated as resources that produce eﬀects (on each other),
these eﬀects are themselves managed (and taken advantage of) by the enter-
prise. The enterprise takes on a strange ﬂip-ﬂopping level of agency in S-D
Logic – it is both working with or alongside its operant resources but at the
same time working upon them, trying to produce eﬀects as a result of its
successful management of them. This terminological inconsistency reﬂects a
larger issue with the co-creation of value as it is formulated in Vargo and Lusch
(2004). How can consumers ever be equal partners in a relationship with the
ﬁrm when the practice of (service) marketing is directed at managing operant
resources (which, of course, includes consumers)?
The service perspective portrays the ﬁrm as embedded in a complex network
of partners all of whom need to be continually negotiated with and ‘related’ to
as each one represents an operant resource for the ﬁrm. This complexity has to
be managed and it is this, according to Vargo and Lusch, which represents the
real utility of the marketer in the service-oriented enterprise. Marketing becomes
the “predominant organizational philosophy” (2004, p. 13) in the ﬁrm. Yet,
how exactly can the co-producing consumer be organised? The intention of
egalitarianism is clear in such phrasings as the ﬁrm’s mission being the “the
application of competences for the beneﬁt of the consumer” (2004, p. 14), its
communication focus being “characterized by dialogue, asking and answering
questions”, and the service-centered view of marketing requiring “collaborating
with and learning from customers” (2004, p. 6). However, behind this persuasive
talk are clear indications of the consumer remaining the same old “target”.
If the co-creation of value depends upon constant dialogue with consumers
what happens when consumers do not want to talk to a ﬁrm? Vargo and Lusch
(2004), along with most co-creation thinkers, tend to assume that consumers
will want to engage in conversation with all the ﬁrms that want to talk with
them. Indeed, in their description of the service-oriented approach they include
a vision of the new marketer as a selling and “buying agent” who “on a long-
term, relational basis” can “source, evaluate, and purchase the skills (either as
intangibles or embedded in tangible matter) that the customer needs, wants,
or desires” (2004, p. 13). This depiction rather implies that the ﬁrm is the more
passive partner, acting as skilled intermediary for the (active) demands of the
consumer. The further implication is that the consumer initiates contact with
the ﬁrm when they need something, the ﬁrm remaining like some mute, Gothic
butler until required. Yet, in their description of an idealized new service-
centered marketing curriculum, they describe the revised study of marketing
communications as covering “the means and mechanisms for initiating and

217

maintaining a continuing dialogue with the consumer and for enhancing the
relationship by using tools such as branding” (2004, p. 14). So, clearly, the
consumer is still a “target” in the sense of having to have dialogue initiated
upon them. Persuasive gambits will be necessary to open conversations with
consumers, to make the prospect of such conversations appear valuable to
them, to maintain engagement in the face of competition. Now the ﬁrm is
the active element in the partnership, constructing value propositions of such
attractiveness and logic that the consumer will be persuaded to choose them as
their co-creation partner. This scenario is, surely, not so very diﬀerent from those
familiar in traditional marketing communication. While an emphasis on one-to-
one, networked communication in the new servicescape might very well mean
that consumers can be approached within a one-to-one, conversational frame-
work, nevertheless they will remain as targets for manipulative gambits which
try to persuade them to adopt one ﬁrm as marketing agent over another.
4 Co-creation and the Search for Marketing
Relevance
The co-creation of value is a vital strategic element in the overall theoretical
framework of Service-Dominant Logic. It underlines the customer-centricity of
the approach, instantiates the ‘customer as operant resource’ perspective, illus-
trates the primacy of dialogue for service marketing, and provides a clear
response to the prospect of connected, empowered (even entitled) consumers.
Just as the Service-Dominant Logic functions rhetorically as an inevitable, evo-
lutionary, unifying answer to the fragmentation eﬀecting marketing theory at the
end of the twentieth century, so too is the co-creation of value functioning
within it as an answer to the creative power that consumers already have.
As marketing’s relevance has begun to be increasingly questioned in the
faculty lounge and the boardroom (Anderson 1994; Clark et al. 2014; Katsikeas
et al. 2004; Kerin 2005; Park et al. 2012; Sheth, Sisodiam 2005), so academic
marketing has had to seek signs of such relevance and embed them within its
formulation. By adopting into the ﬁrm’s strategy something that consumers
have already been doing (discussing, loving, hating, adapting and re-purposing
products and services) the service perspective’s formulation of the co-creation of
value can be seen as actively responding to the change in the balance of power
(and in the location of value). Yet, it can also be seen as constructing a pose
wherein consumers are ‘allowed and encouraged’ by the ﬁrm to co-create value.
The truth is that they have always co-created value – marketing is simply now
218
Chris Miles

theorising how a ﬁrm can take advantage of this (by treating the consumer as a
resource working for the health of the enterprise).
The possibility here is that Service-Dominant Logic uses the co-creation of
value as a way of re-asserting control over the consumer, using terminological
re-direction to valorise the ﬁrm’s management of the co-creation process as a
service response which at the same time claims ownership over the manage-
ment of the process. The ‘new marketer’ cannot organise and manage co-
creation for the beneﬁt of the ﬁrm (even though that might be rhetorically deﬁned
as for the beneﬁt of the consumer) without falling into the trap of managing the
consumer as a target.
In the ﬁnal part of this chapter I will look at a number of examples of
marketing practitioner discourse around the practice of co-creation in contem-
porary interactive marketing communication and examine the way in which
practitioners’ ‘professional talk’ reﬂects similar tensions and strategies to those
that I have outlined above in the academic literature.
5 Marketing Practitioners and the Discourse of
Co-creation
Marketing practitioners and marketing academics might not necessarily listen to
each other, let alone see eye-to-eye on a wide range of topics. While many of the
top marketing journals, for example, profess themselves to be concerned with
issues of relevance for practitioners there is little evidence that the majority of
marketing practitioners ever read those journals. After all, the marketing profes-
sion has its own professional or trade press in such publications (and their
related websites and blogs) as Advertising Age, Ad Week, Brand Republic, and
Direct Marketing News in the USA and Campaign and Marketing Week in the
UK, for example. While research from academic marketing journals does some-
times ﬁnd its way into the pages of the trade press even a cursory review reveals
that the bulk of the latter’s content relates to the dissemination of practitioner
news and practitioner wisdom and experience. In the end, though, the founda-
tional academic writing on the co-creation of value relies for much of its
argumentative weight upon examples of successful co-creation strategies in
business. The marketing practitioner trade press does the same thing, holding
up cases of co-creation as examples of best practice that all can learn from.
A Brand Republic piece by Matthew Gidley (2012), then Director of Strategy
and Insight at agency Momentum UK, exempliﬁes the typical trade press dis-
course on co-creation. It starts oﬀwith the bad news (“The consumer is bored”)
The Rhetoric of Marketing Co-creation
219

designed to provide the persuasive context for its message. We have seen similar
gambits in Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2004) and Vargo and Lusch (2004) –
remind the reader that their jobs are on the line, that the consumer is out of
control and dissatisﬁed. As Gidley puts it, “in Adland, brands are having to
work harder than ever to engage this modern consumer” (2012). The cause
of this is to be found in “modern technology”, which has given consumers the
ability to be “the heroes of their own story” and to reach out by themselves to
“many diﬀerent audiences”. They have become empowered, in other words, and
seek more “empowerment to participate and empowerment to make better
choices”. Gidley states that the only way to get “true buy-in” from such con-
sumers is with co-creation, which he describes as “one of the most fashionable
ideas to enter our repertoire for a long time”. Despite its powerful hold on
marketing practitioners, Gidley argues that the idea of co-creation is often mis-
understood and misapplied. It cannot be simply equated with “crowdsourcing”
but instead has to focus on “harnessing the right people, whether they are con-
sumers, partners or specialists, to create the right social currency”. Gidley’s
point here is interesting. It prioritises expertise, not just in the sense that it sug-
gests brands might need to use specialists to co-create with, but more generally
in the sense that a brand needs expertise (i.e. the expertise of the marketing
agency) to ‘harness’ the correct resources in the most eﬀective way possible.
The approach is deeply redolent of Vargo and Lusch’s (2004) conception of
consumers (and partners) as resources that need to be organised. For Gidley,
“crowdsourcing” is meant to clearly imply a disorganised, unmanaged, almost
anarchic opening of the gates to the mob. True co-creation, on the other hand,
needs to be done with the “right people”.
It seems strange that Gidley can state that consumer expectations of
empowerment and participation are the drivers behind the need for co-creation
strategies and yet then advise practitioners that to co-create eﬀectively they
need to ﬁnd the “right people” (who might not even be the consumer) to
‘harness’ in a co-creation relationship. Indeed, this tension is heightened even
further at the end of the piece when he reminds the reader that the great
achievements of history, “from the momentous task of erecting Stonehenge to
the challenges of the industrial revolution” (2012), have all been achieved
through co-creation. Surely, this makes of co-creation something entirely mean-
ingless? If the industrial revolution can be characterised as an example of
co-creation what cannot? Perhaps Gidley means that these projects (or emerging
structures) depended upon the co-ordination of many experts, specialists and
managers, as well as faceless, unskilled workers. Certainly, we can say that the
prospect of the ‘crowd’ being allowed into the ﬁrm’s design, distribution and
operational decision-making is not what Gidley understands as co-creation.
220
Chris Miles

A Marketing Week article investigating the “secrets of commercial co-
creation” (Allchin 2010) outlines the thoughts of Ben Hayman, then Deputy
Manager of Promise agency. In a similar opening gambit to Gidley’s, the article
stresses the fashionability of the “ill-deﬁned term”, while noting that there
is often “a lack of understanding about the realities of the approach”. While
Hayman’s approach is more inclusive than Gidley’s (he states that “we are all
experts in something” and explicitly notes that consumers should not be treated
as a resource) his approach to commercial co-creation is just as focused upon
the need for management of the consumer as Gidley’s. Commercial co-creation
requires a “dedicated space” run by “focused, skilled and objective facilitators
who are able to interpret, analyse and help to develop the information that is
being developed during co-creation activities”. The marketer becomes a “strong
facilitator” who is able to empower the consumer by encouraging their creativity
and their inclusion into the community of the brand. As Hayman says, “co-
creation is about empowering consumers to contribute, providing a platform
and then following up with them.” This sounds very egalitarian until one
recognises that the assumption here is that power is entirely in the hands of
the marketer – the (chosen) consumer is given power by the facilitator, given a
platform by the facilitator, and then kept within certain deﬁned “parameters” by
the facilitator.
The tension involved in practitioner understandings of the co-creation of
value is perfectly summed up in a piece from WPP’s online ‘reading room’,
written by Andrew Welch (2014) from Young&Rubicam. Welch notes that co-
creation can often mean “letting go to take control”. So, the marketing practi-
tioner allows, indeed encourages, a certain combination of the right outsiders
inside the ﬁrm so that they can be given access to internal resources and led
through just the right pathways to help produce insights and suggestions that
can then be fed into the design team (“Don’t present co-created ideas to a design
team as a fait accompli – nothing will alienate the team faster”). Once again,
this is a tightly ‘harnessed’ and ‘facilitated’ process – Welch expects marketers
rather than consumers to build the community, and also expects them to
manage the type of creation that it produces (“ask your co-creators to make
people”, he directs).
A repeated complaint here is that practitioners do not understand the real
nature of the co-creation of value and instead rely upon ersatz versions such as
crowdsourcing and consumer-generated advertising which fail to capture the
visionary re-balancing of structures and controls that the paradigm promises.
Indeed, such failure might also be leading to the early abandonment of the
whole approach. Pete Blackshaw (2010), a co-founder of the Word-of-Mouth
Marketing Association, notes in an article for Advertising Age that even the
The Rhetoric of Marketing Co-creation
221

agency excitement around such manqué forms of co-creation as consumer-
generated advertising has rather chilled, being replaced with “a pivot back
to the reality of brand control”. Certainly, both practitioner and academic dis-
courses around co-creation have found it diﬃcult to disengage from rhetorics
of control even when they might be appearing to celebrate the prospect of a
more egalitarian balance of power between consumer and brands. So, while
consumer-generated TV advertising might only have found a foothold in a few,
celebrated places (such as Doritos’s yearly ‘Smash the Superbowl’ competition),
the use of consumer feedback, insight, and creative impulse certainly seems to
be rampant across the digital landscape. Encouraging consumer communities to
engage in an ongoing dialogue with you, whether that dialogue is made up of
a ﬂutter of images, 140-character signal bursts, or comments on a blog post,
would superﬁcially seem to be congruent with the conversational emphasis to
co-creation found in the academic descriptions. Yet, even conversations and
communities, it seems, need to be managed. As Richard Bates, European Con-
sumer and Market Insight Director for Samsung, states, consumer community
engagement needs to be carefully shepherded by a brand, “You have duty of
care, otherwise as a resource it becomes overused and its value can ultimately
decline” (Chahal 2015). The language here is, once again, suﬀused with assump-
tions of control over the consumer as a resource, and it is interesting that Bates
eﬀectively uses his communities as expanded focus groups and test kitchens
rather than full-ﬂedged partners in the creation of the brand. Indeed, the full
surrender of control that the co-creation paradigm demands is perhaps innately
antithetical to the marketing practitioner, whose job it is to manage engagement,
organise communication, and navigate the creation and maintenance of brand
identity.
6 Conclusion
The academic and practitioner discourses around the concept of the co-creation
of value are reactions to similar threats. In the case of practitioners, digital plat-
forms and online consumer communities have the potential to wrest control
away from brands and make traditional marketing management models ineﬀec-
tive. For the marketing academy, the threat takes the form of irrelevance –
whether that is situated in the dangerous lack of unity that faced the discipline
in the 1980s and 90s or the increasing distrust of marketing at the boardroom
level. For both discourse communities, the co-creation of value represents
one component in a matrix of strategies designed to reinvigorate marketing by
(re-)asserting control over an expanded realm of resources.
222
Chris Miles

The service and relationship perspectives in academic marketing research
have tended to support the idea that manipulative, asymmetrical, and control-
oriented approaches to marketing management are generally counter-productive
and inappropriate in an increasingly networked market. Calls for a marketing
based upon mutually beneﬁcial, constructive dialogue between brands and con-
sumers have moved from the periphery in marketing theory towards the center.
However, there has been little attention paid in these discourses to the very deep
level at which assumptions of control over consumers inform the fundamental
enterprise of marketing. These assumptions appear to be endemic to the market-
ing enterprise, reproducing themselves even within the ostensibly egalitarian
discourses of co-creation. Marketing academics, even when very aware of the
rhetorical power of word choice and framing, have diﬃculty with ‘following-
through’ in discourses encouraging the surrendering of control and ﬁnd them-
selves constructing persuasive narratives designed to oﬀer hope in the face
of adversity. Practitioners have similar problems with the ramiﬁcations of the
co-creation of value – often adopting the construct as a rallying ﬂag for an
industry nervous about the loss of control to consumers and often betraying
in their resulting ‘professional talk’ the continuing search for lines of control,
organisation, and management of the consumer. As some practitioner voices
have noted, the ‘management’ of co-creation is a diﬃcult and time-consuming
task even when the concept is understood clearly. It is, perhaps, not surprising
that while the term remains popular in professional marketing discourse its
practical adoption has been far from universal and its interpretation has become
somewhat ﬂuid.
More than anything, then, the co-creation of value works as a rhetorical
rallying point for both academics and practitioners. Its egalitarian ﬁguration,
emphasising dialogue, mutual respect, the ﬂattening of hierarchies, and trans-
parency of operation serves to make a ‘new’ marketing which is discursively
constructed to counter the old marketing management paradigm of consumer
targeting and manipulation. However, that old marketing management para-
digm continues to exert a powerful inﬂuence on both the language and reason-
ing of academics and practitioners. The visionary, almost millenarian, tone with
which Prahalad and Ramaswamy close their presentation of the co-creation of
value is perhaps the clearest indication of the status of the construct, oﬀering
up a salvatory hallucination of “a new basis for the social legitimacy of all large
institutions in our society” (2004, p. 238), a bright, cleansed future for business
as the handmaiden of truly participatory democracy.
I would argue that contemporary marketing (both academic and profes-
sional) is subject to the heavy demands of the “attention economy” (Lanham
2006, p. 7). Marketing theorists and agency marketing managers need to
The Rhetoric of Marketing Co-creation
223

compete for the attention of their various consumers. The co-creation of value is
a discursive strategy aimed at positioning the discipline of marketing in front of
audiences who are distracted by issues of consumer empowerment, changing
communication habits, and fears of irrelevancy. As such, it is fundamentally
paradoxical in its formulation: if all ﬁrms entered into co-creative relationships
with their consumers, consumers would never have the time to do anything else
other than create with ﬁrms, and so in order to apportion their attention eﬀec-
tively they would have to make decisions as to which ﬁrms they will enter into
such time-consuming relationships with, and as a result those ﬁrms will have to
engage in persuasive strategies in order to compete for that attention, but this is
against the spirit of co-creation as it will lead us back to the ‘old’ marketing of
manipulative communication games. Yet, while this paradoxical structuring is
highly problematic when considering co-creation as a workable basis for a
future marketing it is entirely inconsequential for the co-creation of value’s
role as a rhetorical construct. In this sense, much of the discourse around
co-creation serves as disinformation – it distracts consumers and clients from
the unchanging control-orientation of marketing practice and theory, misdirect-
ing attention towards a supposed egalitarian epiphany in the discipline and
constructing a frothy, feel-good, yet deeply paradoxical version of marketing
which bears little resemblance to the manufacturing of interest and desire that
is at the root of marketing’s disciplinary identity. Seen in this light, co-creation
itself becomes a ‘traditional’, short-term marketing strategy of disinformation,
designed to stimulate waning demand for the discipline and its practitioners
through an appeal to the fears and hopes of its consumers and clients.

4.2 Spread the Word – The Eﬀect of Word of
Mouth in e-Marketing
Abstract: Word of mouth (WOM) is an extraordinary mechanism with which to
spread information and disinformation. There is an interaction between WOM
and eWOM, creating diﬀerent channels for the dissemination of information.
However, this information cannot be controlled by marketers; at least this is
seldom the case. Positive and negative comments are found in eWOM and they
have a powerful inﬂuence on credibility, trust and persuasiveness, where inﬂu-
encers play a main role. Brand reputation is shaped by the ﬂow of information
and disinformation on the Internet. Social networks are a real tool with which to
create and place information. A comment may greatly beneﬁt consumers, pre-
venting uncertainty and boosting sales. eWOM disseminates both information
and disinformation, and so internet users and marketers are faced with the
problem of how to turn this to their own beneﬁt.
1 Introduction
Word-of-mouth (WOM) is “an interpersonal communication in which a sender
spreads a message to receivers” (Bao, Chang 2014, p. 21). The same idea when
applied to the Internet becomes electronic word of mouth (eWOM), a 21st century
phenomenon.
The power of WOM is so well known that in 2004 the Word of Mouth
Marketing Association (WOMMA) was founded in order to lead the WOM industry
through advocacy, education, and ethics. According to WOMMA (2014), WOM is
the driving force behind 13% of sales, while paid marketing in total accounts for
20-30% of sales.
Online consumers have more power than do other consumers and this
diﬀerence may even be increasing. In fact, thanks to the Internet, the relation
between ﬁrms and consumers has changed dramatically and now this relation
is more favourable to consumers (Kucuk, Krishnamurthy 2007). Everyone, any-
where, at any time is able to express their opinion.
Above all, WOM has a huge impact on the service industry, where the poten-
tial customer needs information in order to choose which service to purchase.
The tourist industry is one of the main sectors where WOM has proved its poten-
tial, as a service, people need opinions so that they can choose a hotel, a
restaurant or cruise.

Electronic WOM (eWOM) plays an important role in electronic marketing
(e-marketing) nowadays because comments can evoke emotion and aﬀect
behaviour. The real motivation to generate information on the Internet (Ho,
Dempsey 2010) is the need: to be part of a group, to be individualistic, to be
altruistic and for personal growth. Being part of a group and being altruistic
are more relevant to the beneﬁt of the group, and being individual and personal
growth are more related to personal values. Consumers generate and distribute
information and disinformation, which can lead to a response from other
consumers or enterprises.
In this scenario, the purpose of this chapter is to clarify the main points for
both parties (companies and consumers) and to provide a holistic perspective on
the eWOM world that aﬀects marketing strategies. Firstly, by means of a com-
parison between WOM and eWOM so as to comprehend the diﬀerences and rela-
tionships between oﬄine and online channels and how information is conveyed.
Secondly, the role of inﬂuencers through online comments is shown, as well as
the value of positive and negative comments. Thirdly, the three key variables
(trust, credibility and persuasiveness) are examined together with their inter-
connection in eWOM. Fourthly, the impact of eWOM in brand reputation is out-
lined, where disinformation is highlighted as well as the use of social networks.
Finally, an insight is provided into how information is presented in eWOM and
the beneﬁts derived.
2 Comparison between WOM and eWOM
User-generated content is an ensemble of positive or negative comments (Cheong,
Morrison 2008; Gretzel, Yoo 2008). Overall, WOM is the provider of this content.
It can be argued that there are two diﬀerent ways of spreading information
and we can classify them into two distinct groups: WOM in-group (close friends
or family) and WOM out-of-group (actors near a person’s social, familial, work
and collegial circles) (Brown, Reingen 1987). Moving one-step forward, eWOM
could aﬀect the WOM out-of-group in a more extensive way, because it has
evolved in reaction to technology, and an individual has access to any informa-
tion written by any other individual in the world. Actually, eWOM out-of-group
also makes reference to contact with people whom the individual does not
know (Abrantes et al. 2013).
The number of internet users is sharply increasing as well as the number of
connections between them. The possibilities of augmenting eWOM out-of-group
is more relevant because of its much larger audience. The mathematical relation
is that of one individual to the population at large.

The media used to spread information is diﬀerent between WOM and eWOM.
The main channel involved in eWOM is social media. In contrast, WOM favours
face-to-face connection as direct interaction rather than more distanced means
of spreading information.
In the study “Global Trust in Advertising” by Nielsen (2015), consumers
respond more to “recommendations from people I know” as a ﬁrst choice. In
second place comes “the branded websites” and in third “consumer opinions
posted online”. As table 1 shows, among the top six trusted ways of advertising,
only the ﬁfth aﬀects WOM directly, while eWOM solely applies to the second,
third and sixth positions.

eWOM
Keller and Fay (2012) reinforced Nielsen’s results regarding “recommendations
from people I know”. As human beings, interpersonal relationship is the key to
WOM. However, 90% of conversations are oﬄine (WOM through face-to-face
conversations) and only 8% online (eWOM). Is it possible to conﬁrm that
eWOM has a deeper impact than WOM?
WOMMA (2014) asserted that oﬄine WOM is responsible for 2/3 of the
impact, while online only accounts for 1/3. However, they both amplify the eﬀect
of paid media by 15%. Compared to traditional advertising, WOM has an im-
mediate impact, especially in the ﬁrst two weeks. In the movie industry, eWOM
particularly aﬀects the ﬁrst week’s box-oﬃce revenues and after the second week
both WOM and eWOM have a direct inﬂuence on revenues (Bae, Kim 2013).
The “go viral” eﬀect is higher in eWOM than WOM. As mentioned before, the
huge number of users on the Internet is a useful means of spreading information
and thus the “go viral” has a higher potential in eWOM than WOM. However, it
is worth noticing the close interconnection between WOM and eWOM, where the
omnichannel is latent, because a face-to-face comment can be included on a
website and online information can be broadcast in a TV programme. The same
information and disinformation may be spread through diverse channels.
Spread the Word – The Eﬀect of Word of Mouth in e-Marketing
229

If there is a trend to use omnichannels, how can enterprises keep track of
where information concerning them is located? Unfortunately, there is no direct
tool for marketers to control both online and oﬄine channels (Allsop et al.
2007). In the case of eWOM, there are several social media monitoring bodies
such as e.g. Netvibes, Datashif, UberVU. Unfortunately there is no consensus
on which is the most appropriate tool to receive feedback and various com-
panies, marketers and researchers have tackled the problem without any relevant
success.
Both WOM and eWOM studies on communication agree that a favourable
comment increases the probability of purchase and unfavourable word of mouth
has the opposite eﬀect (Arndt 1967; Ho, Dempsey 2010). Reading comments is a
mean to reducing uncertainty. As a general rule, in the oﬀand online world, the
principle of saving time is of paramount importance, consumers try to cut down
on the time spent on searches by using the comments of other like-minded users
or by asking for information.
Communication through both channels has the same direction: one-to-one,
one-to-many and many-to-many. While in face-to-face communication, informa-
tion assumes an oral format, in electronic communication information is written
and endurable (Barreto 2014). However, written communication is more eﬀective
because it leads senders to describe products and brands more accurately
through a self-enhancement eﬀect (Berger, Iyengar 2013).
Several researchers agreed that anonymity is a unique characteristic in
eWOM (Breitsohl et al. 2010; Cheung et al. 2008). However, in WOM the sentence
“someone told me”, also implies anonymity, and this feature is made even
clearer on the Internet. It is also worth noticing that anonymity provides a
greater opportunity to formulate misleading information, because the source is
anonymous and so cannot be veriﬁed.
Besides, people often make their decisions after consulting online informa-
tion (Lee 2009). Therefore, eWOM aﬀects not only online purchases, but also
those in the real world (ﬁgure 1). The opposite eﬀect is also well known by com-
panies and mostly aﬀects local commerce, being detrimental to their sales. It is
common practice for consumers to visit a small retailer only for the purpose of
seeing a product recommended online or oﬄine physically and then to purchase
it online.
Although eWOM is gaining in popularity, marketers should not believe that
eWOM has replaced WOM (Fulgoni, Lipsman 2015). Oﬄine and online communi-
cations are complementary and marketers need to see both channels in a holistic
way. Enterprises are adapting themselves to the present situation because con-
sumers use cross-channel information. Years ago, business focused on developing
multi-channel selling approaches and now they are turning into omnichannel
230
Maria Elena Aramendia-Muneta

strategies, where consumers check information on oﬄine and online channels
and then they decide where to buy. The IBM Omnichannel Capability Index
(2015) pointed out the need of providing a shopping experience independent
of the chosen channel. In that case, the interconnection of eWOM and WOM is
crucial to consumers due to their omnichannel behaviour.
3 eWOM: Negative vs Positive Comments
Negative comments are more persuasive than positive reviews, particularly,
among females (Bae, Lee 2011a; Jeong, Jang 2011). Negative reviews have a great
impact on consumer-based brand equity. Contrary to popular belief, a bad
comment not only deeply aﬀects a small company’s equity, but also that of
renowned enterprises (Bambauer-Sachse, Mangold 2011). Thus the size of a
company does not render it immune to this eﬀect.
Negative eWOM (eNWOM) postings have a greater linguistic impact on
users. This language normally expresses anger on the part of the poster and
connects more to their frustrations (Gheorghe, Liao 2012). Negative emotional
expressions tend to have less of an impact than might be expected because
consumers believe that those expressions are based on an irrational disposition
(Kim, Gupta 2012). eNWOM is sometimes perceived as disinformation, especially
when it is placed among numerous positive eWOM (ePWOM).
Negative eWOM has a more signiﬁcant eﬀect on experience goods than on
search goods and even more so if the website’s reputation is taken into account.
These negative comments are more reliable on established websites (Park,
Gretzel 2007; Park, Lee 2009).
The real problem with eNWOM is the fact that enterprises do not perceive
a negative comment as a chance to improve. The geniality will transform an
eNWOM into an ePWOM and create a real asset for the company. Kikumori and
Ono (2013) identiﬁed that an eNWOM may have a positive impact.
Figure 1: Relation between eWOM, WOM, and purchase
Spread the Word – The Eﬀect of Word of Mouth in e-Marketing
231

However, if ePWOM appears together with information connected to a pro-
motion, it is more persuasive than negative eWOM (Zhang et al. 2010). Positive
expression in a single positive comment does not lead to positive impact (Kim,
Gupta 2012).
A basic human motive (self-enhancement) guides consumers to create
ePWOM, while NWOM is merely transmitted (De Angelis et al. 2012). Statistically
speaking an ePWOM occurs three times more often (3 to 1) than an eNWOM (East
et al. 2007). Customers spread eNWOM when there is a serious failure (Wang
et al. 2014). A satisﬁed consumer is more prone to writing a positive comment
than an unsatisﬁed customer is prone to writing a negative comment. However,
in the study by Cheung et al. (2007) cultural diﬀerences were found: Chinese
eNWOM is based on venting anger and punishing the business organization,
while US eNWOM will seek compensation and the correction of a bad situation.
Through positive comment, the sender has a deep inﬂuence on the receiver.
The two-step ﬂow communication (Katz 1957) also applies to eWOM. In this
case, there is a push communication relation (ﬁgure 2), where the aim is to
spread information through intermediaries and to push consumers to buy or
even to get them to advise other consumers to do so. Both manufacturers and
producers need to ﬁnd the best inﬂuencer with the best impact on potential
customers (Arenas-Gaitan et al. 2013). When inﬂuencers really believe that a
service or product could beneﬁt consumers, their comments improve the credi-
bility of the brand and increase purchase intention. Fashion bloggers are
well known as a best inﬂuencer. A good example is Chiara Ferragni with more
than three million followers on Instagram and 500,000 unique visitors of her
renowned blog “the blonde salad” every month. Each time she recommends a
certain product it sells out in a very short space of time. Harvard Business
School wrote a business case based on Chiara Ferragni’s success.
Figure 2: Push relation between positive comment, credibility, and purchase intention
Such inﬂuencers are on the whole considered as leaders. When their messages
are accurate and comprehensive, followers react more strongly to this infor-
mation (Bao, Chang 2014; Godes, Mayzlin 2009). Inﬂuencers have the role of
leadership and that is why manufacturers and producers should ﬁnd a leader
to spread their information so as to proﬁt from it (return on investment in e-
marketing) or generate a multiplier or ripple eﬀect. Overall, an authoritative
232
Maria Elena Aramendia-Muneta

opinion maker entices future customers or fosters a behavioural outcome. How-
ever, it remains unclear whether inﬂuencers have been paid by the enterprise to
write positive comments. The market rate for inﬂuencers is around €6,000 to
promote a product or a brand.1
A problem with the inﬂuence of eWOM arose when it was discovered that
some hotels created fake comments, which is an illegal practice and forbidden
in Britain, Ireland, France, Italy and Germany. This malpractice continues
because the average payment for hiring somebody willing to make such com-
ments is around €8 per comment. Li et al. (2014) demonstrated some patterns
that reveal the authenticity of a message. A fake comment may include exces-
sive use of superlatives and a lack of detail and description.
To sum up, eWOM is created through comments, where the information can
constitute eNWOM or ePWOM. Both can aﬀect purchases, eNWOM reduces the
percentage of sales, whereas ePWOM has the opposite eﬀect.
4 eWOM and Variables
The key elements to eﬀective persuasion on the Internet are credibility and trust
(Teng et al. 2014). Credibility, trust and persuasiveness are variables that are
closely interconnected (ﬁgure 3). Although some researchers have tried to focus

233

their studies on one variable (Cheung et al. 2009; Pan, Chiou 2011), their ﬁnd-
ings proved that one variable cannot survive without the other. If a comment
is credible, readers rely on it and the message can persuade them to react by
following its recommendation, as for example, encouraging the buying of a
product or just improving the brand’s reputation. That way, the overlap of the
three variables is shown and they act as a chain of events.
4.1 eWOM and Credibility
As a rule, there is a push relation between positive comments, credibility and
purchase intentions. A positive comment has a positive impact on credibility
and inﬂuences purchase intention (see ﬁgure 4, Chih et al. 2013). However, this
simple model has some moderators that enhance or temper credibility.
Figure 4: Push relation between positive comment, credibility, and purchase intention
On the Internet, the credibility of the creator of any information might suﬀer
due to lack of face-to-face contact. The more positive comments are presented
on a website, the higher its potential to undermine the credibility of the site,
although it may result in higher scores (Doh, Hwang 2009; Reichelt et al. 2013).
Not only negative, but also positive comments could be detrimental to the
credibility of the source.
However, if eWOM is customized (visual cues, numbers), it becomes more
trustworthy, due to the fact that consumer experiences are relevant (Ha 2002;
Teng et al. 2014). Users’ acceptance of online reviews as reliable increases for
comments if the user perceives the post as useful or recognises social ties with
the poster (Teng et al. 2014).
Another variable aﬀecting credibility is product type. A review of an ex-
perience product is most credible when it appears in an online community and
is given more credit than a search product comment when it appears in a
consumer-developed review site (Bae, Lee 2011b).
234
Maria Elena Aramendia-Muneta

The previous experiences of participants as well as the quantity and articu-
lation of posts are major factors. Readers of information may give it more credit
when they are able to compare diﬀerent opinions, as in that way they have the
opportunity of choosing which is more convincing (O’Reilly, Marx 2011).
The initial model in ﬁgure 4 has moderators that aﬀect credibility and the
ﬁnal decision (ﬁgure 5).
Figure 5: Moderators aﬀecting credibility
4.2 eWOM and Trust
Gender is a moderating factor in online trust and the intention to shop online.
Women attach more value to responsive participation (e.g. a real conversation,
where there are interactions between comments), while men give more value to
the ability to post online content (Awad, Ragowsky 2008).
Trust is the foundation of success in the banking sector, where consumers
have to entrust their own money to a speciﬁc institution. A positive word of
mouth has a positive eﬀect on electronic banking use and enhances trust in a
particular bank, while a negative comment inﬂuences the consumer, creating
risk and potential mistrust (Ashtiani, Iranmanesh 2012).
What really undermines the trust of a ﬁrm when it receives eNWOM is their
failure to take immediate action (Audrain-Pontevia, Kimmel 2008). Users are
wary of those ﬁrms that do not act in a proactive manner.
Researchers generally show a connection between levels of trust and credi-
bility. In fact, the variables present in credibility also aﬀect trust. Cheung et al.
(2009) showed that consumers are more likely to trust eWOM when comments
are more credible.
Spread the Word – The Eﬀect of Word of Mouth in e-Marketing
235

4.3 eWOM and Persuasiveness
When it comes to persuasiveness, inﬂuences play a major role. In fact, the repu-
tation of a reviewer directly aﬀects followers and laggards’ purchase behaviour
due to their trust of expertise.
The information given by residents is more persuasive in the accommoda-
tion, food and beverage sectors than travellers’ experiences, whose opinion has
more inﬂuence in the destination category (Arsal et al. 2010).
Evaluating a product with a promotion goal has a positive impact on the
target reader. Actions that are more negative tend to generate negative eﬀects,
whereas positive actions tend to have positive eﬀects as a response (Zhang et al.
2010).
Without trust in the credibility of a comment, there is no persuasiveness.
Persuasion relates closely to consumer beliefs. The conclusions of the study by
Teng et al. (2014) found that credibility (trustworthiness) is a main characteristic
of persuasion in eWOM messages.
5 eWOM and Brand Reputation
In social discussion eWOM is an indicator of the reputation of a brand, be it
a company or the author of a book, and it even aﬀects complementary goods
(Amblee, Bui 2011).
In the banking sector, loyalty and ePWOM derive from user-friendly web
development and satisfaction on the part of the customer (Casaló et al. 2008).
However, several researchers have drawn similar conclusions regarding the rela-
tionship between technology readiness and eWOM (Chen 2011).
Gender is a variable that directly aﬀects brand reputation, because women
are more willing to post brand-related content on Facebook than men (Choi,
Kim 2014).
In an eWOM group, if there is a strong connection between the stake-
holders, they react less aggressively when their brand receives eNWOM and
tend to downplay criticism, because they regard the brand as if it were an
integral part of the group (Chang et al. 2013).
Dissatisfying product or service experiences produce eNWOM, which is
strongly detrimental to the company’s reputation and sales when the company
does not take immediate action to solve the problem of unsatisfactory product
or service experiences (Nyer, Gopinath 2005; Burton, Khammash 2010). How-
ever, if the company treats the complaint adequately, this rapid reaction increases
consumer loyalty and satisfaction level (Hong, Lee 2005). After eNWOM, prompt
feedback reduces the overall impact on the brand (Shimabukuro Sandes, Torres
Urdan 2013).
236
Maria Elena Aramendia-Muneta

The better known and bigger a company is, the higher the number of anti-
brand sites that appear, which are deleterious to the brand image (Krishnamurthy,
Kucuk 2009). In those anti-brand sites, the language used has a marked ideolog-
ical and transactional component.
Post-purchase reviews written by e-communities can create harmful rumours.
Thus, companies have to pay particular attention to negative feedback and
eNWOM in order to safeguard both their brand and their online reputation.
Brands really need to promote e-interactivity with their potential consumers
or potential eWOM senders to protect their image. Harmful rumours might be
prevented if the brand automatically reacts reasonably. Otherwise, the snowball
eﬀect (Brooks 1957) may impact them and disinformation can increase in a way
that the brand cannot control.
6 eWOM and Social Networks
Social networks can be considered as a broadcast medium and, of course, they
play a main role in eWOM and create consumer-to-consumer communication
(C2C). However, there is a diﬀerence in the way information is presented: in the
typical way as on Facebook or Twitter, and discussion communities such as e.g.
TripAdvisor. Researchers consider the ﬁrst group as a provider of information
in a social context while the second is considered a source of information
(Arenas-Gaitan et al. 2013). The main diﬀerence is the interconnection among
readers on Facebook (replies are possible) and this is not the case on TripAdvisor.
There has been much debate (de Cristofaro et al. 2014) regarding recent
practices where a company is able to buy e.g. 10,000 likes for around €36, which
is why even the comments a potential customer may ﬁnd within a social net-
work make them wonder whether they have been bought.
Individuals are primary actors in social networks (SNs) and, they construct
online communities around their opinions and contributions where they can
identify themselves as part of a group (Brown et al. 2007).
Social networks provide the likelihood of expanding social circles, but when
community members use the fan page its main purpose is to collect information
to be used by enterprises. Facebook collects personal data from users which they
then sell to attract advertisers. However, users tend to express their preferences
by clicking on “Like” rather than sharing the information within their social
circle (Chen 2011).
What happens with those social networks such as Facebook where the user
can only “Like” or do nothing? Facebook users tend to be more positive than
negative (Chen et al. 2013), because they do not have the possibility to express
Spread the Word – The Eﬀect of Word of Mouth in e-Marketing
237

a simple “Not Like” when they do not agree. They only have the chance to
express “Like” to a negative comment.
In SNs like Twitter, those users who are motivated by the brand, the so
called “brand followers”, serve as role models and tweet or retweet brands’ links
(Chu, Sung 2015). In fact, the information on a SN has higher impact on inten-
tion and trust than the information included on a ﬁrms’ website (Meuter et al.
2013).
However, up to now there are a number of questions left unanswered which
presents challenges for new research: how can a company monitor each fan in
terms of revenue? What is the best way of measuring social networks? How can
thousands of fans be converted into proﬁt?
7 eWOM and Information
As a rule, eWOM is based on recommends, shares, likes and comments. How-
ever, comments can be classiﬁed not only according to positive or negative
information, but also according to their content. After analysing information on
numerous conversations in discussion forums, Andreassen and Streukens (2009)
considers that, they can be divided into four main categories:
a)
Information request
b)
Usage experience
c)
Business practice issues
d)
Comments pertaining to new product launches.
As can be seen, these four main categories relate to a ﬁnal business purpose.
Information request aims at a prospective purchase, usage experiences and com-
ments relating to new products are a response from buyers and can encourage
potential consumers. Finally, business practice issues are closely related to the
image of the enterprise and can boost sales.
Other researchers such as Hung and Li (2007) have highlighted four cate-
gories for the responses found in virtual communities:
a)
Sources of social capital
b)
Brand choice facilitation
c)
Persuasion knowledge development
d)
Consumer reﬂexivity.
There is not much consensus about how to generalize information in eWOM. It
seems apparent that a comment can facilitate the choice of brand and product
and is the driving force behind consumer persuasion. In this process, experience
is used as a mediator as well as business practice.

eWOM has changed the buying environment. The amount of information
that a consumer can access has developed new ways of organizing information
and specialized sites such as e.g. TripAdvisor, where the buyer can compare
prices, evaluate other visitors’ opinions and classify a service not only according
to the price variable. e-marketing strategists see the need to identify more
variables in order to be able to apply the best strategy. An example might be
the motivation behind the creation of fake comments that create disinformation
(Levine et al. 2010).
8 eWOM and Beneﬁts
Who really beneﬁts from the information on the Internet?
On the one hand, individuals transmitting information satisfy self-needs
such as being part of something noticeable. They also increase their social needs
and intentions, such as helping the community and bonding socially (Alexandrov
et al. 2013). By helping out another member of a virtual community the com-
municator enhances their self-worth (O’Reilly, Marx 2011).
Consumers use eWOM because they need to avoid uncertainty and risk in
their purchases (Chan, Ngai 2011; Goldsmith, Horowitz 2006; O’Reilly, Marx 2011).
In contrast, customer participation through eWOM inﬂuences behavioural
outcomes, which also aﬀects ﬁrms’ outcomes by increasing eﬃciency and
generating higher revenues (Bolton, Saxena-Iyer 2009). When a product receives
a positive evaluation from consumers, as for example on Amazon, it is more
likely to be purchased (Leskovec et al. 2007).
eWOM has been recognized as a powerful driver of purchaser intention that
really beneﬁts enterprises. In fact, virtual communities foster attitudes and
purchase intentions (Huang et al. 2012). As various researchers have conﬁrmed
purchases, as well as brand image and reputation, are much inﬂuenced and
enriched by eWOM (Jalilvand, Samiei 2012).
Regarding the relation between consumers and ﬁrms, eWOM helps to enhance
conative and action loyalty levels (Roy et al. 2014). The largest beneﬁt of loyalty
is an increase in long-term sales as well as the fostering of repurchases.
9 Conclusion
Although there are several factors that inﬂuence eWOM, this chapter tries to take
a holistic approach, because ultimately the various eﬀects are interconnected
and it is very diﬃcult to assert that any single factor is the trigger in eWOM.
Spread the Word – The Eﬀect of Word of Mouth in e-Marketing
239

EWOM creates both information and disinformation, because as consumers we
cannot clearly identify valid information, and ﬁrms cannot reliably identify
whether a comment is genuine or a fake.
In eWOM, inﬂuencers have a leading role and are a mediator between enter-
prises and potential customers, but they can also create disinformation because
some may be paid to assert something positive even when they themselves are
not convinced of it.
ENWOM needs to be followed and attended to, because it directly aﬀects
e-reputation. A prompt response may prevent a potentially undesirable snowball
eﬀect. However, too much ePWOM is also suspicious and can project a distorted
image of a company.
Virtual communities are very relevant to companies and they can be a
crucial asset for them in critical situations. Social networks can be a tool to
promote such virtual communities.
The information within individual comments is diﬃcult to classify, because
the amount of information on the Internet is so huge and there are few studies
in this area.
There are many unknown factors in this ﬁeld which need to be examined
and clariﬁed that are fundamental for companies in order for them to convert
the information into a source of revenue. Although there are several studies of
eWOM, there remain gaps that require further research.

4.3 User-Generated Internet Memes as
Advertising Vehicles: Visual Narratives
as Special Consumer Information
Sources and Consumer Tribe Integrators
Abstract: Internet memes – highly evolutive iconic, yet topical contents with
shared meanings replicated and spread by and to the Internet folk – have
become a prevalent Internet phenomenon (Figure 1). Embedded in a culture of
consumption, Internet memes often employ branded contents in the expression
of personal messages, which often could not be farther from the contexts origi-
nally intended by organizations. Yet, there is little business insight into memes.
The following chapter introduces the concept of memetics and its connection
with Internet memes as a cultural phenomenon and a social communication
channel. The prospects for using Internet memes as marketing vehicles are
then evaluated.
1 Introduction
Internet memes may be described by the characteristics of face-to-face gossip:
being very fresh and up-to-date, while transmitting information in a very peculiar
way. A ridiculous mistake on the Internet by a celebrity, or even by an unknown
user is good enough for it to become the target of the mischievous Internet folk.
If one is lucky enough, the online joke will only last for a short period of time
and result in less loss of face (e.g. stars occasionally falling over on the red
carpet), if not they will become part of online conversations or even the vernacular
(e.g. the Streisand eﬀect1). Successful memes on the other hand can even lead to
the creation of a whole business (e.g. Grumpy Cat). As memes become part of

1 The Streisand eﬀect describes “the process leading to a greater diﬀusion of information that
would be kept conﬁdential on the Internet in the case of no manipulation” (Liarte 2013, p. 103).
It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress
photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, published in the framework of an unrelated
project, inadvertently drew further public attention to it.

the everyday vocabulary and part of consumer culture, they turn out to be
sources of consumer insight as well as advertising vehicles in their own right.
As such, they need to be included as a part of the corporate and advertising
vocabulary.
Despite the extraordinary growth of user-generated contents (UGC) Internet
memes being among them, advertisers and advertising agencies still remain
hesitant to venture into this unproven context (Krishnamurthy, Dou 2008). Their
concerns stem from a fear of intruding on a “consumer” environment, a lack of
understanding of UGC users and their behavior, and a lack of control over the
context in which their advertising is exhibited. However, a sustained corporate
presence in social media could legitimize the role of UGC as a full-ﬂedged
medium and therefore contribute to integrating it into the marketing (communi-
cations) toolkit. To do so, advertising needs to learn about memes’ ecosystem,
cultural role, values and its own place therein and furthermore to be able to
handle their lack of control in marketing communications, and therefore the
spontaneous appearance of information and disinformation.
2 From the Concept of the Meme to Internet
Memes
The foundations of meme theory can be traced back to evolutionary biology.
The concept was introduced by biologist Richard Dawkins (1976), who develops
Darwinian evolutionary theory to state that while biological selection works at
the level of individuals, genes are the replicators that enable variation, which is
the precondition for evolution. Genes contain the genetic information material
and at the same time serve as the transmission channel for them. According to
the ﬁnal thoughts of Dawkins’ (1976) book, the complexity of the human mind is
enabled by the fact that genes are complemented by other information replicators
in its evolution. These latter are referred to as memes by the author. Memes are
conceptualized as the units of cultural transmission, and replicators of the
human cultural environment (Dawkins 1976, p. 192). Memetics are introduced
into the social domain by Dennett (1995), while Sperber’s (1996) deﬁnition of
culture welds it to the ﬁeld of epidemiology (cultural epidemiology). Memes
can be easily conceptualized as viral, for minds “are typically massively infected”
(Dawkins 1993, p. 20) by the highly ﬂexible information carriers that are memes,
which makes them easily inherited through the recoding of the cerebral nervous
system, without requiring a full generational turnover (instead of spreading
vertically from parents to children, they often spread laterally across peer
groups). A limitation to the epidemiological metaphor is that while cultural
248

memes are indeed contagious and do mutate, they are not pathological for
individuals (while they can still be so for organizations that venture into trying
to use them in their communications).
In their working mechanism (e.g. diﬀusion patterns and evolutionary traits)
memes operate similarly to genes, while in form, they are memorable units of
the human mind, the evolution and diﬀusion of which take place trough inter-
personal communications and various human artifacts as channels (e.g. pictures,
books, narratives, written and digital data storages, etc.). While memes them-
selves are ideas and therefore are invisible, meme-carriers, i.e. the “physical”
tools that contribute to spreading them are observable. Their forms and repre-
sentations can be most varied: a jingle2, a thought, a password, fashion, a
procedure or an architectural style can become a meme, as well as blind faith3,

coming”: A widely recognized and highly customizable image and motto

2 The memetic diﬀusion of music can explain in part, for example, the often heard accusation
of musicians “stealing” their biggest hits, or parts of these (e.g. guitar riﬀs) from others
musicians. While sometimes these loans can indeed be voluntary, in many other cases, they
can be the result of music writers being so inﬂuenced by a tune that “it sticks in their heads”
(see “stolen riﬀs” in any online search engine).
3 Religions, for instance, can be considered as memes (Dawkins 1976). One can, for instance,
argue that religions are interpretations of natural anomalies as observed by ancient com-
munities that were later stylized and structured (and re-structured [see e.g. the Reformation])
in a continuous process of transformation.

tolerance, freedom of speech, conspiracy theories, but also e-mail chain lists or
funny Internet images (Veszelszki 2013).
According to meme theory, memes’ evolution is the eﬀect of blind chance
and natural selection. During diﬀusion they continuously transform, and natural
selection can be observed through the proliferation of the most successful
variants. Limitations of the human mind force memes to compete in order to
reach as much attention through as many minds as possible. Success therefore
in the case of a meme means that it outperforms other similar communication
messages both in lifetime and diﬀusion dynamics (Williams 2000). A successful
meme can thus be considered an artifact of shared social norms, world views,
common perceptions and user preferences (Shifman 2013). In this sense memes
fall short of genes in terms of replicating ﬁdelity and blind obedience.
It is important to note that the current, colloquial use of the term meme is
diﬀerent from the traditional, scientiﬁc construct. While the traditional approach
to memes has abstract and often controversial subjects, the colloquial interpre-
tation refers to very speciﬁc contents (and to their derivatives). Moreover, while
memetic studies focus on cultural entities that are successful over the long term,
Internet memes are creations with high topicality and sudden success, that may
or may not become successful in the long term (Shifman 2013). In order to
ensure a seamless transition between the academic and colloquial meaning,

Wiggins and Bowers (2015, p. 11) oﬀer a three-stage hierarchical system of
the process of memetization. According to this, successful contents are initially
in a (1) maintenance mode, to then become (2) emergent memes and then
(3) (genuine) memes.
On the way to becoming a meme content ﬁrst needs to be spreadable
(Green, Jenkins 2011), i.e. to be interesting enough in some respect to be dis-
seminated by users in its original form. Having reached the stage of spreadable
media, the content is in a maintenance mode. At this stage, the content is viral,
yet still is not a meme. Success triggers imitation and creative reinterpretation:
active bricoleurs add new context and creative content to the original idea, lead-
ing to emergent memes. Emergent memes are topical, and can somehow be
related to the original context and message. An idea then can become a genuine
meme when it reaches a critical mass4. In this meme status, an idea becomes
universal, while cultural reinterpretation and potential subcultural aspects are
replaced by mass audiences and mass usage (Williams 2000).
At the meme stage the original message and context are largely lost and
the meme becomes self-serving. An advantage of a meme status is to have a
mass cultural awareness. It also bears the paradox of a lack of context while
being multicontextual: in the case of Internet memes, modiﬁcation as a core
phenomenon allows for the overstepping of social and cultural boundaries set
by the original (intended) meaning, thus broadening the proﬁle of the original
idea (Bauckhage 2011).
4 The evolutionary character of a meme can be illustrated by the triumphal march of the “Charlie
bit me” video (https://youtu.be/_OBlgSz8sSM). The video had spent six months unnoticed in the
clutter of user-generated contents until noticed and featured, in November 2007 by a comedy
website (Collegehumor.com) with a large audience. The video quickly went viral (the original
video has had 840 million views as of April 2016), but only became an emergent meme when
inspired users started producing, uploading and sharing their own versions of it. Remixes and
mimicries appeared, ranging from users reinterpreting the original video (e.g. by adding back-
ground music – see e.g. https://youtu.be/pOle1AnPOc4) or by replaying the scene, typically
with adults performing the roles of the two main child characters (even to the extent of produc-
ing politically incorrect reinterpretations, such as horror versions – e.g. https://youtu.be/
RlH5aMng7mo [explicit content]). Note that a few years later a (now unavailable) commercially
licensed version equally appeared (with a moderate success), produced by baby food giant
Gerber to help promote the company’s new line of ﬁnger foods (Shifman 2014). One can call
the phenomenon a genuine meme as the phrase “[Charlie] bit me” has become proverbial
among the Internet folk – and has since been used in contexts often utterly diﬀerent from the
original (see e.g. Figure 2).

3 Internet Memes as Consumer Tribe Integrators
While the term meme has become a “catchall for freely copied and amusing
content online” (Murray et al. 2013, p. 329), one can, based on the above, con-
ceptualize them as a pool of variants of iconic, yet topical visual/audio/textual
contents generated and spread by and to the Internet folk that have already
undergone transformation, yet still bear a number of common properties and
shared meanings for a given community, and that often originate from unwitting
sources (Csordás 2015, p. 101). As such, memes “are often created by anonymous
persons [. . .] without anything marking the identity of the original creator”
(Patel 2013, p. 237). Moreover, successful memes can be interpreted as the result
of user agency, i.e. of intentional choices made by a large number of users to
disseminate and/or rework a text (Green, Jenkins 2011).
The process of memeﬁcation is greatly facilitated on the Internet by so-called
meme templates (often referred to as image macro memes), thanks to which users
can generate new meanings and new messages to the most renowned audiovisual
contents with a minimum of required eﬀort and added creativity. Indeed, as
a form of “parasitic art” (Katyal 2010) Internet memes use original texts and
images as tools to communicate. They convey information framed in a peculiar
way, giving way to expressing personal understandings as well as more complex,
somewhat related or associated values.
The spreading of such a message can occur “because it is funny, profound,
carries a good message and/or otherwise speaks to a large volume of people”
(Freund 2013, p. 128). But, more than just funny images on the net, memes are
successful cultural artifacts that represent topical and/or universal ideas that
occupy the Internet folk’s minds.
As a form of free Internet speech image macro memes are powerful proxies
as they often tend to essentialize, oversimplify and exaggerate the themes and
topics they address, while they oﬀer self-contained arguments with open-ended
interpretation depending upon recipients’ context. Internet memes are the
imprint of a peculiar (simple, yet extremely expressive) representation of their
creators’ realities: they are the anonymized reﬂection of their creators’ thoughts,
desires, fears and concerns, without the weight of the layers of censorship peculiar
to traditional, mainstream media. As such, humor (ranging from quirky through
oﬀbeat and bizarre to potty (Knobel, Lankshear 2007)) and/or irony are primordial
elements of Internet memes. As a feat of the web 2.0 along with sensationalism,
they act as a “megaphone” (Zittrain 2014, p. 389) and contribute to getting and
keeping the limited attention of the masses in the high clutter of such images.

Most memes “might sound nonsensical to those unfamiliar with internet
culture, they do have meaning and purpose to those [communities] they inhabit”
(Freund 2013, p. 134). Memes construct and fuel aﬃnity spaces (Gee 2007) of
shared knowledge and meanings (Figure 3): the majority of topical successful
Internet memes are more likely to spread through homogenous communities
(in the form, for example, of inside jokes or intertextuality) and social networks
rather than through the Internet at large (Bauckhage 2011).
At the same time, as proxies, images used in memes to express a message
often (ever more in higher stages of memeﬁcation, mutation being a necessary
trait of a meme) supersede the image’s original meaning and “ﬂow takes primacy
over origin” (Nooney, Portwood-Stacer 2014, p. 249). Internet memes are thereby
used to divert original information to express an often utterly diﬀerent new
message. However through an intended resemblance in content or in form to
the original message, these new messages have the capacity to complement or
supplement (e.g. diﬀuse, condense, popularize) the original information, but
also to piggyback on it to give new meaning and even to contradict or dispute
it in its own form, therefore leading to potentially diﬀusing disinformation.

4 The Role of Internet Memes in Marketing
As corporate communications begin to follow the audience's consumption patterns,
Internet memes are increasingly becoming an interesting ground for corporate
marketing (communications) activities, and companies have recently shown an
increased interest in exploiting the potential economic value of the channel. The
major challenge in doing so is the question of control, as the “creations” of the
Internet folk may not represent the very same intended message that was set by
corporate representatives in strategic planning. Still, these internet memes serve
as a new and authentic representation of brand and product communication.
Indeed, memes are a potential manifestation of consumer experience outside
of the domain of the core service, and completely in the domain of the consumer,
embedded in their context, activities, and experiences. According to the meaning-
based approach (Mick, Buhl 1992) audiences attach diﬀerent meanings to
messages within their personal contexts (interest, cultural background, etc.).
Mass personal representations through memes then are ideal tools for monitor-
ing users’ perceptions of topical societal issues, as well as brands.
While memes are based on seized, spontaneous, unsolicited moments, they
are also authentic representations of the creators’ feelings. This embeddedness
is all the more important that “many things consumers value do not inhere
in tangible products but increasingly derive from images, cultural texts, and
mediated experiences” (Fisher, Smith 2011, p. 332). By acknowledging that
consumption is a form of self-expression in postmodern society, cultural artifacts
are then supposed channels for carrying brand-related user manifestations, at
least in small-scale consumer tribes. Memes can also be considered artifacts of
culture. First, users invest much of their time into creating, disseminating or
simply consulting them, thus transmitting their sense of self into these cultural
products (Gehl 2014).
Mining popular memes is key to applying a cultural strategy model to
branding. Consumers’ associative networks of memory, and thus the meaning
that they carry about a brand can be studied throughout these cultural repre-
sentations. Internet memes can then be used by marketers as an alternative
research tool, to map and audit how their brands are positioned in the minds
of consumers (“semantic DNA”) (Marsden 2002).
As a quantitative tool, the number of available Internet memes makes it a
task of big data analysis to identify and sequence how brands are positioned in
the minds of consumers. As a qualitative tool, meme mapping can be used to
identify second- or third-order meanings associated with a brand (e.g. through
intertextual references) and thus to identify market niches and/or brand stretch-
ing opportunities (Marsden 2002). Mind maps can be drawn from the various
254
Tamás Csordás, Dóra Horváth, Ariel Mitev and Éva Markos-Kujbus

topics addressed in memes, leading to a result similar to a biological “tree of
speciation”, where the evolution of meanings can be observed and studied
(Freund 2013).
While it is questionable whether marketers have the possibility of memeti-
cally modifying their brands in order to better appeal to their consumer (as the
underlying “carpet bombing” advertising tactic would require serious marketing
communications eﬀorts with questionable returns on investment), they can
nevertheless study the perceived ﬂaws of the brand with an aim to correct them
(e.g. the perceived service gaps related to the product, apparent enough to be
represented in memes and shared among consumers (Csordás 2015). Moreover,
brand mapping can help determine whether a brand’s position is suitable for
user-generated advertising campaigns. Negative double jeopardy theory (Kucuk
2010) postulates that strong brands might also have some disadvantages over
weak brands in the sense that consumer meanings associated with them can
transcend their marketing performance, even at a societal level (e.g. Coca-Cola
perceived as a euphemism for capitalism), thus making them an easy target for
user-generated antibranding.
5 Internet Memes as Advertising Vehicles
Memes can be considered as advertising assets for brands “because, like
celebrities, they have an audience that recognizes and appreciates them” (Sax
Figure 4: The Karl Marx Credit Card

255

2012, p. 69). In form, their commercial exploitation can take shape in a tradi-
tional approach of the licensing of a popular content for advertising reasons or
in a more subtle approach, where companies embrace the fact that in the many-
to-many context of the interactive, digital, user-generated environment, anyone
can be the “user”. Thereby company-generated messages begin to take an ever
more similar form to user-generated content (a corporate practice referred to
as stealth marketing), making it literally impossible to correctly identify the
true source of a piece of content, as well as determine whether a brand-related
content was paid- or unpaid-for (Katyal 2010). However, the Internet folk in
many instances have been shown to enforce the grassroots and authentic nature
of user-generated contents as a norm. As such, fakes or apparent corporate
contents are hardly tolerated, leading to simple indiﬀerence5, community dis-
dain or exclusion (Kozinets et al. 2010).
In the study of electronic word-of-mouth (of which meme diﬀusion is part –
for more detail, see chapter 4.2 on the eﬀect of word-of-mouth in e-marketing),
Armelini and Villanueva (2010) distinguish between (1) organic, (2) ampliﬁed
and (3) exogenous contents. This classiﬁcation can help in understanding the
role of corporate content in the viral diﬀusion of Internet memes.
(1) Organic content is the most powerful form, accounting for the greater
part of online word-of-mouth (Bughin et al. 2010). As such, Internet memes
are equally predominantly organic. In this case, the creation and diﬀusion of
content is voluntary, based on actual user experiences.
The diﬀusion of content is (2) ampliﬁed when an external (corporate) trigger
is involved. For instance, organizations can build upon the popularity of other
memes to spread their own corporate messages. The use of popular imagery
for a corporate goal raises the issue of copyright, where an otherwise fair
use practice (that of cultural exchange) can quickly become an infringement
(commercial exploitation of intellectual property) if not handled (i.e. licensed)
or if discovered by the originator. Even if it is not discovered, this activity
can be considered piggybacking. In a best-case scenario, the audience winks
together with the brand, and may embrace the association of image (i.e. that
of the brand with an external source) as a shared cultural reference (e.g. a
restaurant using names in reference to popular TV shows on their menus or
boards, targeting a “geek” audience (Csordás 2015). However, there is always a
5 e.g. brands trying to connect to their community using various memes. Such a topical meme
is the “Chill out lemur” (aka “Everybody calm the f*** down”) meme template, where organiza-
tions resorting to the meme are still often reluctant to include the f-word into the texts of their
message for being oﬀensive, thereby also eliminating a core authentic element of the meme.
Also see e.g. note nr.4 on the failed commercial exploitation of the “Charlie bit me” meme.

danger of community disapproval or even rejection if done in ways that go
against the community’s (target group’s) values. Thus, exploiting memes in
such ways equally becomes a community management issue.
(3) Intentional or exogenous contents are expressly company-generated
sources. Here a company, e.g. as part of a marketing communications campaign,
encourages consumers to share contents on its behalf. Investing in generating
intentional word-of-mouth for an organization is risky because of the uncer-
tainties related to the execution of such campaigns and the relative loss of
control, while the eﬀects are diﬃcult to measure (Bughin et al. 2010).
Creating memes for advertising purposes is a delicate corporate endeavor.
Memes as part of a planned marketing communications campaign seldom become
genuine memes, or even emergent memes. When they do it is rather by a com-
bination of a deep understanding of the target audience (engendering a valuable
consumer insight and a tailored communication message), a serious media
budget (to ensure high reach/coverage), and (mostly) blind luck6.
For instance, contrarily to traditional advertising, memes account for a very
unique genre (Wiggins, Bowers 2015) with attributes known to members of the
Internet culture, but needing to be mastered by the advertiser (for the rhetoric
of marketing co-creation, see chapter 4.1). Moreover, certain attributes of memes,
such as immediacy and free dissemination are in direct contradiction with
corporate structures. The momentum, i.e. rapid uptake (and often: fall) of
Internet memes requires quick responses which rigid corporate policies (e.g.
control procedures, authorizations to publish, etc.) do not oﬀer. Moreover,
meme dissemination does not work in plannable ways. Memes gain their power
from derivatives born through an organic growth. The purpose of the idea of
memes is easy recreation (Patel 2013), which by deﬁnition cannot happen in a
centralized, corporate-controlled environment. From then on, however, the orga-
nization has no control over the channel and a corporate-message-become-
meme spreads. In the case of successful diﬀusion, the message inevitably
reaches a wider audience than the fan base or the original target group (Patel
2013), whereby it is exposed to a general meaning manifestation (and further
meaning-making) of the larger public. By reaching various and diverse commun-
ities of aﬃnity, the message is left grounds for possible societal critique if the
brand is predisposed (cf. negative double jeopardy).
A reason why company-generated messages often fail to become genuine
memes is their lack of authenticity and organicity: while on the surface they

may appear to be memes, with the cessation of marketing agency (i.e. fund-
ing), the “wannabe-meme” equally ceases. Such was the case with meme cam-
paigns building on the popular “photo fads” genre (see e.g. planking) such as
“razorbombing” (backed by Schick razors) or “shamrocking” (by McDonald’s)
(rYANrULZ01 2011).
In early 2012, McDonald’s started a Twitter campaign soliciting users to
share pleasant stories about Happy Meals using the hashtag-named McDStories.
While McDonald’s had paid for having their hashtag promoted on the Twitter
homepage, users hijacked the hashtag to turn it against the corporation. While
the campaign itself was suspended within two hours, the hashtag is still used
by users to sign antibranding messages (Hill 2012).
The most important facet of the presence of corporate messages in the
digital sphere is the role of consumers as transmitters. If we accept that adver-
tising images are a top-down, overly exaggerated reﬂection of society, then
Internet memes can be conceptualized as the grassroots counterparts of these
images. Internet memes are a mocking mirror of society, and within, of the
consumer culture most represented by brands and advertising.
In general, consumer-generated advertisements (CGA), as a special type of
user-generated content, can vary from the modiﬁcation of elements of a com-
pany’s advertising material (e.g. by distorting the meaning, the imagery, etc.)
through the uploading of original variations on a theme of a company’s adver-
tising material (e.g. humorous, subversive variations or spoofs) (thus creating
emergent memes) to proposing original materials. Berthon et al. (2008, p. 8)
deﬁne “consumer-generated ads” as “any publicly disseminated, consumer-
generated advertising messages whose subject is a collectively recognized brand”.
Even though consumers may create ads about almost anything (themselves,
their favorite TV shows, etc.) consumer-generated advertisements by deﬁnition
are speciﬁcally targeted at collectively recognized brands. The nature of a brand
as an asset makes the issue of consumer-generated brand ads so critical. Berthon
et al. (2008, p. 14) oﬀer a typology of consumer-generated advertisements, a
categorization equally useful for the assessment of Internet memes as advertis-
ing vehicles. The authors distinguish between four categories: (1) concordant,
(2) subversive, (3) contrarian and (4) incongruous.
A lampoon of a brand’s ad might be categorized as (1) “concordant” in the
case that the message is not necessarily negative and deteriorating and both the
audience and the responding ﬁrm wink and nod, the ﬁrm accepting a criticism
on the one hand and carrying on with their own brand building. Moreover,
many fan-generated Internet memes fall into the concordant category as they
often praise the brand (even through a slightly critical tone idiosyncratic to the
258

genre) while placing them in consumer associated (usage) contexts. This way,
Internet memes about popular TV series may often contain brand mentions or
imagery as illustrations of a given activity as a whole.
A case of a traditional (TV-focused) advertising campaign become meme –
partly due to being well-recognized and acted upon by the advertiser – was the
2010 “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” campaign for Old Spice by ad
agency Wieden+Kennedy. It featured former NFL player Isaiah Mustafa reciting
a monologue about how anything is possible if a man uses Old Spice. The ad’s
creative hook was so strong, that it inspired numerous (and fairly positive)
consumer reinterpretations in the social media. Old Spice did manage to leverage
the traditional media campaign on the meme scene by supplementing it with an
interactive online marketing campaign, e.g. by oﬀering numerous short reply
videos based on the original creative hook, but varying in content. This proac-
tive strategy made it possible for the brand to stay in control of the advertising
idea and message to a certain extent by providing constant, massive and
dynamic social media presence, in direct competition for the attention of viewers
with the user-generated variants.
In the case that consumer-generated material is inevitably deleterious to
the ﬁrm (e.g. by ridiculing the brand using its own messages or style) the ﬁrm
should classify it as (2) “subversive” and respond accordingly. The occurrence
of such antibranding and consumer protest (see chapter 1.1 on advertising
critique) is more likely in the case of renowned brands (cf. negative double
jeopardy), where consumer brand meanings go beyond the brand itself and
take on a societal level, leading to the practice of culture jamming.
For example, a common conception related to McDonald’s can be that of
unhealthy food, while Coca-Cola can often be considered as an allegory of
capitalism on a societal level: common conceptions that antibranding memes
are keen to put into a visual form (Kucuk 2015).
MasterCard’s advertising campaign tagline since 1997 has been “Priceless”.
The slogan associated with the campaign is “There are some things money can’t
buy. For everything else, there’s MasterCard”. The slogan, and especially its last
chunk, contains a massive creative hook with a widely universal yet very brand-
speciﬁc message. This universality caused the slogan to become a successful
meme among consumers, as it oﬀers wide possibilities of intertextuality, while
the Priceless campaign oﬀers a structure for creative user-generated reﬂections,
similarly to meme templates. MasterCard’s strategy to keep the slogan for many
years equally contributes to sustaining the meme, oﬀering at once repeated
user-generated brand exposure. Yet, as the phrase is part of a registered trade-
mark, the company has considered derivatives as subvertising – mainly because
of the contexts it can appear in – and through the years it has taken legal action

against various parodies for trademark violation and dilution. While such legal
action may be conceivable against institutional media outlets and partners7
(even though fairly weakly defendable), such uses in consumer-generated media
can be considered as fair use (Patel 2013) (Figure 5). As such, if no commercial
exploitation is intended, it is strategically unwise for the organization to take
legal action considering the potential social impact (e.g. Streisand eﬀect).
(3) “Incongruous” and (4) “contrarian” types of CGA are (respectively: positive
and negative) oﬀ-message to the original meaning. As such, they are less of
a direct threat to the ﬁrm in the sense that although the message conveyed is
not in accordance with the oﬃcial communication and messages of the ﬁrm,
it cannot be directly retraced to and tallied with by the audience and therefore
follows a route on its own as an advertising or anti-advertising message. More-

7 E.g. A bank in a town in former East Germany, Sparkasse Chemnitz (formerly: Karl-Marx-Stadt)
ran an online poll in 2012 letting customers vote for images to place on their credit cards, where
the image of Karl Marx won. As the bank is associated with MasterCard’s services, the potential
appearance of the logo of this former with the latter image could even have engendered corporate
tensions for the subsequent image association (Figure 4), all the more that such promotions’
appearance in international mass media might favor new consumer associations and user-
generated derivatives (Figure 5).

over, Horváth and Mitev (2016) state that as opposed to brand value (a long-term
concept), the organizational outcome of company-relevant Internet memes that
we can refer to as meme value is rather temporary: it can rapidly escalate then
drop just as quickly.
Most brand-related Internet memes fall into these two categories, as even
though a brand’s message or a brand-related sign becomes a meme, it will do
so in a user-generated context, and this context is going to become an online
convention, without necessarily reﬂecting the original (brand-intended) meaning
(Freund 2013). This process is ever accelerated by mutation, a necessary trait of
a meme, which forecasts the limitations of a direct use of memes as advertising
vehicles.
For example, the meme template called “The Most Interesting Man in the
World” is an interesting case of an advertising campaign becoming a meme
(Ulrik 2010). The template is a memeﬁed version of a campaign for the Dos Equis
beer brand. It is a message hijacked by users for its strong creative hook (in the
original: “I don’t always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis”). The ad’s
message has thus survived, however deprived from the brand, in the general
form “I don’t always. . . But when I do. . .”. At the same time, a widely-used
image macro of the meme is still based on a screen from the original ad,
the product itself can still be seen on the image macro, and thus on every new

variant based upon it. This way, the brand wound its way into the everyday lives
of the Internet folk.
According to Kucuk (2015, p. 4) the idea behind consumer antibranding is to
create noise in the corporation-consumer communication processes. However, it
can be argued that a fundamental aspect of the Internet-enabled user-generated
communications is the creation of a large quantity of noise/clutter, independently
of users positively, negatively, or otherwise interpreting and intending messages.
The reason behind this is that one simply cannot expect user-generated media
to be resource-optimized, as users are not economically interested in doing so
while they have eﬀortless and costless access to the communication channels.
In this ecosystem, all brand-related contents (including memes) are in direct
competition with organizational marketing communications goals and eﬀort for
users’, and potential customers’ attention (Weng et al. 2012). All the more impor-
tant for organizations is to map the relevant communications ecosystems and
evaluate the importance thereof in relation to their own organizational com-
munications eﬀorts.
6 Conclusion
As oversimpliﬁed and exaggerated creations, Internet memes are authentic pieces
of online culture. For being predominantly user-generated, it is hard to judge on
the truth of the information they bear. Indeed, everyday users, creators are not
bound by corporate rules, ethics or copyright laws, instead they can use any
means they deem necessary for sending their own messages. As successful
brands and their advertising can be considered part of consumer culture and
brand messages as widely recognized cultural products, they may contribute to
visually sending messages more easily, which can explain their inclusion in
user-generated messages on the Internet, even in ways and contexts that could
not be farther from the contexts originally intended by the organizations. As
users’ motivations to include a brand’s message go well beyond the nurturing
of brand image in traditional advertising, the “authenticity” of a message is
likely to prevail over the “truth” of brand information presented within.
Still, in a sense, users are creators of pieces of advertising and/or subvertising,
and in this way become a potential source of unlawful competition for slower-
moving ﬁrms’ communication eﬀorts. As pieces of advertising, this grey area
can equally be used by corporations themselves (in the form of peer users
among many others), and have recourse to stealth marketing or to creative
piggybacking on successful topics (i.e. Internet memes) for their own sake. By
doing so they risk (if discovered) being prosecuted for it (legal consequences)

and/or facing the disdain of a community of users seeking authentic contents
while rejecting fakes (social consequences).
This brings about the idea of control, which for memes is minimal. Memes
(e.g. because of meme templates) are an easy-to-access visual channel of
communication. As such, while Internet memes (alone, or in the form of an ad
campaign) are less likely to succeed as a voluntary piece of corporate advertis-
ing, they could be used instead as a marketing forecasting and planning tool.
Indeed, they represent, illustrate and magnify consumer opinions in a brief,
catchy and highly accessible way.
Moreover, most visible memes (e.g. in search engine ﬁndings, online articles,
etc.) are arguably those that have gone through the memetic selection process
and can be presumed to be the most successful pieces. Therefore these represen-
tations might be considered as a target group’s genuine representations of a
brand or product. Of course, it is important to proceed with caution with the
use of memes as a marketing research tool, and to avoid a new type of market-
ing myopia not to project user voices to the whole consumer base.
As veracity becomes of secondary importance in Internet memes, they can
be channels – often simultaneously – of both information and disinformation.
As we saw above, this phenomenon seems to be a core characteristic of the
genre. Therefore organizations can either embrace and include the loss of
control in their strategies by various techniques (such as humor, or explicitly
using distinguished channels for passing veriﬁed corporate information) and
thereby take away the edge of potentially harmful messages – and disinforma-
tion –, or they can endeavor to educate – together with policymakers or platform
operators – the audiences to information literacy regarding this channel as a
mass medium.
