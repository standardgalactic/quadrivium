Preface
Inventory management constitutes an important research area in operations
management. The research has mainly focused on the problem of how inventory
managers should make their procurement decisions and allocate limited inventory
to satisfy customers’ demand. Around this central problem, a wide variety of
interesting topics have been examined, including the effect of the procurement cost
structure on inventory policies, demand learning and forecasting, and lead-time
management.
Previous work on lead-time management has primarily focused on the supply
side. Supply-side lead-time corresponds to the delay between the time an inventory
manager places a replenishment order and the time the replenishment actually
arrives. The problem has been considered in a number of contexts, including
stochastic lead times, multiple supply sources with different procurement costs and
lead times, and multi-echelon, to name a few. There has also recently been an
increasing interest in applying the idea of lead-time management to the demand
side. Demand-side lead-time can be interpreted as the delivery delay between the
time a customer places an order and the time the order arrives. Demand-side
lead-time has gained attention in part because ﬁrms have begun to realize that
customers have heterogeneous delivery-time requirements, and they can exploit this
heterogeneity to their advantage by offering multiple delivery-time options to
customers. This delivery-time-based differentiation strategy is particularly useful
when ﬁrms have scarce inventory and face a long replenishment lead-time on the
supply side. Although industry practices of such a strategy are abundant, a more
rigorous theoretical treatment is still lacking and would be of great practical value to
an effective implementation of the strategy.
We develop a modeling framework to analyze the problem of inventory
management with alternative delivery times in this book. The general context
considered here is that a seller replenishes its inventory in ﬁxed intervals and,
between replenishments, allocates the limited inventory to satisfy customers who
are both price and delivery-time sensitive. On the demand side, customers have
heterogeneous delivery-time requirements and choose either spot or late delivery.
This theoretical modeling captures the essence of real-world business practices such
vii

as the delivery-time market segmentation strategy adopted by automobile
dealerships in China and many other similar examples. We focus on the seller’s
optimal inventory replenishment and demand fulﬁllment policies, and our results
provide managerial insights into the merits of ﬂexible delivery-time options. Similar
applications such as the group-buying mechanism are also examined. The main
mathematical tool used in theoretical analysis is dynamic programming. This book
is written for students, researchers, and practitioners in the areas of operations
management and industrial engineering who are interested in understanding the
rationale of ﬂexible delivery times and designing successful applications.

Chapter 1
Overview
Abstract Firms now recognize the important role of delivery time in both
customer segmentation and inventory management. In this chapter, we discuss the
merits of delivery-time management and its practical implications. We then highlight
our research presented in this book. Related literature is reviewed at the end of this
chapter.
1.1
Introduction
By deﬁnition, lead time corresponds to the latency between the initiation and
completion of an action or a process. In a supply-chain context, lead time is essential
and visible almost everywhere. It is fair to say that where there is an order, there could
exist a lead time. Effective lead-time management is thus crucial to the success of
supply chain management.
Perhaps the most obvious lead time in a supply chain is the replenishment lead
time, which is the time between when a replenishment order is placed and when
the order arrives. The role and optimization of the replenishment lead time have
been given much attention in both theory and practice. Researchers have previously
studied the optimal replenishment policy in the presence of stochastic lead times
(Kaplan 1970), multiple delivery modes (Neuts 1964; Lawson and Porteus 2000)
and etc. Meanwhile, real-world ﬁrms have long recognized that a reduction in the
replenishment lead time can signiﬁcantly improve the responsiveness of a supply
chain. For example, H&M and Zara are fast fashion retailers. In addition to their
talented instincts about fashion trends and quick response programs with shorter
operational cycles, their acclaimed achievements in cutting lead times have led to
their phenomenal success (Caro and Martínez-de Albéniz 2010).
What seems less obvious is the lead time on the demand side, i.e., the delay in the
fulﬁllment of customer orders, or simply the delivery time. There are several reasons
why delivery time has attracted relatively less attention. First, delivery time is less
of a concern for traditional brick-and-mortar stores, in which customers are mostly

Overview
fulﬁlled on the spot from on-hand inventories and the demand is relatively stable and
predictable. Second, customer orders are likely to arrive sequentially rather than in
a batch as in the case of replenishment orders. Hence, although ﬁrms recognize the
importance of delivery time, it is hard for them to keep track of, let alone manage,
the delivery times of individual customers.
In recent years, the prosperity of e-commerce has given delivery time an increas-
ingly important role. Most online orders are shipped by couriers rather than picked up
by customers themselves. Also, with the aid of advances in information technology
and logistics, ﬁrms are now able to implement a ﬂexible delivery-time manage-
ment system and offer customers multiple delivery-time options to segment them. In
addition to a reﬁned market segmentation, delivery-time management on the demand
side has other beneﬁts. For example, delivery time can be used to counteract the
supply-side lead time, and information from advance orders can help ﬁrms to improve
their decision making (Hariharan and Zipkin 1995). Firms may also resort to ﬂexible
delivery-time options to cope with unexpected situations such as a severe supply-
demand imbalance (Liang et al. 2013).
All of these beneﬁts has made ﬂexible delivery times a popular topic in academia
and industry. Speciﬁcally, an effective implementation of the strategy depends on
details such as the following:
• the commitment control of each incoming customer order;
• the clearance of backlogged orders;
• the replenishment decision in the presence of delivery-time management; and
• joint pricing and delivery decisions.
The discussion of these issues calls for a comprehensive analytical framework. In
the last decade, we have been working on the problem of ﬂexible delivery-time man-
agement involving topics such as optimal inventory commitment and replenishment
policies, joint pricing and inventory-control decisions, and prioritized backlogging
clearance, to name just a few. We have formulated real-world problems using mathe-
maticalmodels,developapproachesfortheiranalysis,andinterprettheoreticalresults
into managerial insights for the better design and execution of ﬂexible delivery-time
management. In this book, we intend to provide a uniﬁed treatment of the preceding
models, summarize and provide a critique of the major results, and shed light on
potential research directions.
1.2
The Aim of This Book
In this book, we follow a progressive approach to lay out our research. In Chap.2, we
introduce in detail the real-world examples that inspire our research. These examples
explain the rationale behind ﬁrms’ applications of ﬂexible delivery times. We illus-
trate that ﬁrms may resort to delivery-time management for a variety of reasons. For
example, automobile dealerships offer multiple delivery options to customers when
they face a severe supply-demand imbalance. Manufacturers can beneﬁt from ﬂexible

delivery times because of the improvement in production planning. Online retailers
allow customers to choose from a menu of shipping options for a more effective use
of shipping capacities. Service providers make use of alternative delivery times to
better segment the market.
We start with a baseline model in Chap.3 to capture the essence of the examples
(the dealership example in particular) presented in Chap.2. The basic setting is as
follows. We consider an inventory system with alternative lead times. The seller
replenishes its inventory in cycles and satisﬁes its customers using commitment
control between replenishments. Customers are classiﬁed into two segments accord-
ing to their price and lead-time sensitivities: short and long lead-time customers.
The orders from short lead-time customers need to be satisﬁed on the spot from the
on-hand inventory, and the orders from long lead-time customers can be postponed
for a late delivery. In compensation for the late delivery, long lead-time customers
pay a lower price than their short lead-time counterparts. With such a model, we are
able to derive the optimal inventory replenishment and commitment policies.
The baseline model serves as a foundation for a number of extensions, which
we analyze in subsequent chapters. As can be seen in many real-world examples,
the delivery schedule is ﬂexible rather than rigid. That is, the seller may choose
to deliver a backlogged long lead-time order earlier than promised. We call such
an action an upgrade and investigate the upgrade mechanism in Chap.4. Although
the upgrade decision complicates the seller’s decision-making process, it improves
the service level and saves the seller from carrying too much inventory. In addition
to obtaining the optimal replenishment and upgrade policies, we further calibrate
the model parameters using the empirical data collected from Toyota dealerships
and calculate the optimal policies and several performance metrics accordingly. The
results indicate that the optimal upgrade policy can improve both proﬁt and inventory
use. In Chap.5, we further incorporate the pricing decision and study the joint pricing
and inventory-control policies. Moreover, we provide a preliminary comparison of
the two mechanisms to illustrate their respective advantages and disadvantages. In
Chap.6, we focus on the speciﬁc problem of how backlogged orders should be
cleared when replenishments arrive. We assume that the seller handles backlogged
orders with three common priority rules. We characterize, evaluate, and compare the
inventory commitment policies under these three priority rules.
Although the setting of the baseline model and its various extensions may appear
restrictive, the modeling and analysis approaches are general and can be applied to
problems of asimilar nature. InChap.7, weillustratethis point usingthecaseof group
buying. The seller offers a regular spot-selling option and a group-buying option. We
show that the same kind of customer segmentation and demand rationing used in the
models with alternative delivery lead times also applies here. We characterize the
optimal rationing policy and further discuss several extensions. The results are of
practical value to ﬁrms that offer multiple selling options.
The rest of this chapter reviews the related literature.

Related Literature
In this section, we review the literature related to our work. We focus on two major
streams of research: inventory models with supply-side lead times and inventory
systems serving multiple demand classes.
There is a large body of literature on the optimal inventory policy for either deter-
ministic or stochastic supply-side lead time. Fukuda (1964) studies a multi-period
inventory system with two deterministic lead-time options and characterizes the
optimal threshold policies in both cases with and without the setup cost. Neuts (1964)
and Lawson and Porteus (2000) extend Fukuda (1964) to further consider multiple
delivery modes. Kaplan (1970) discusses a dynamic inventory problem with random
delivery lead times, in which a no-crossover assumption is imposed. He shows that
the optimal policies are similar to those obtained in the case of deterministic lead
times. Ehrhardt (1984) solves an inﬁnite-horizon model with stochastic lead times
and obtains the optimal policy under both discounted- and average-cost criteria. Song
and Zipkin (1996) investigate an inventory system in which the replenishment lead
time follows a Markov process. Song (1994a,b) elaborates on the effect of lead-time
uncertainty on inventory policy and optimal cost using measures of long-run average
cost and discounted cost, respectively. Chen (2001), Ozer (2003), and Ozer and Wei
(2006) study inventory replenishment and pricing issues in periodic-review inventory
systems in which the demand is segmented by delivery lead-time requirements. Led-
erer and Li (1997) look at the competition between ﬁrms serving lead-time-sensitive
customers. As mentioned earlier, our study focuses on the role of demand-side deliv-
ery lead times. On the supply side, the optimal inventory replenishment policies
resemble those in the literature. On the demand side, ﬁrms can use the heterogene-
ity in customers’ delivery-time requirement to their advantage. For example, when
the on-hand inventory is running low, ﬁrms can backlog patient customers for late
fulﬁllment and reserve on-hand inventory for impatient yet high-margin customers.
When the on-hand inventory is abundant, ﬁrms can choose to ﬁll all customer orders
on the spot to reduce inventory carrying costs.
When there are multiple demand classes and their demands exceed the limited
inventory, a multi-level rationing policy is often used to achieve the optimal proﬁt by
reserving different levels of inventory for different demand classes. There are three
common modeling frameworks: periodic-review, continuous-review, and queuing
inventory models. In the context of periodic-review inventory models, the pioneer-
ing work of Veinott (1965) introduces the concept of rationing to satisfy the demands
from multiple demand classes. Topkis (1968) further reﬁnes the model by dividing
the replenishment cycle into a ﬁnite number of intervals. The on-hand inventory is
allocated in each interval, and unsatisﬁed demand can be either backlogged or lost.
Kaplan (1969) independently obtains the same inventory rationing policy as that in
Topkis (1968) for the backlog case. Cattani and Souza (2002) study an inventory
system serving customers with two lead-time requirements and compare numer-
ically the performance of the inventory rationing policy and the simple priority
rules policy. Jang (2006) and Jang and Kim (2007) characterize the production,

inventory rationing, and distribution decisions under a newsvendor-type model in
which there are two classes of customers with different waiting costs. Frank et al.
(2003) investigate a periodic-review inventory system serving a deterministic and
a stochastic demand streams. The deterministic demand must be satisﬁed, and the
inventory replenishment incurs a setup cost. An inventory rationing policy is used
to reserve inventory for the committed deterministic demand. Ding et al. (2006)
develop an inventory rationing model that incorporates a price-discount mechanism
and allows backlogging. Duran et al. (2008) discuss a multi-period inventory system
where demands are differentiated according to their lead-time requirements, desig-
nated as Shorts and Longs. At the end of each period, after the Shorts and Longs mate-
rialize, the supplier decides the amount of inventory to reserve, the amount of Longs
to backlog, and the amount to replenish. They obtain the optimal (S, R, B) policy,
where S, R, and B represent the order-up-to, reserve-up-to, and backlog-up-to lev-
els, respectively. Gupta and Wang (2007) examine a periodic-review inﬁnite-horizon
inventory model serving both transactional and contractual customers in the make-
to-order and make-to-stock/make-to-order environments. They prove that a threshold
policy is optimal for the make-to-order mode and that a two-critical-number policy
performs well for the make-to-stock/make-to-order mode.
In the context of continuous-review inventory models, Deshpande et al. (2003)
analyze the performance of a static threshold rationing policy, under the assumption
that the inventory is replenished according to a (Q,r) policy (i.e., when the inventory
position falls to the level r, a replenishment order of Q units is placed). Arslan et al.
(2007) consider a model with deterministic replenishment lead time using the (Q,r)
policy to fulﬁll customers with different shortage costs. They derive efﬁcient heuristic
algorithms to ration inventory for different customer classes.
Queuing models are also popular in the study of the optimal production control
and inventory rationing policies. Ha (1997a,b) analyze a single-product production
system that operates in a make-to-stock environment with backorders and lost sales.
De Véricourt et al. (2001, 2002) extend Ha (1997b) to a manufacturing system
with multi-class customers. Carr and Duenyas (2000) extend these models further
to a multi-product manufacturing system to address the sequencing issues under
admission control. Chen et al. (2007) study the optimal admission control of selling
channels for an etailer. The etailer can sell products on the websites of one or more
third parties under the cost-per-click scheme.
We use a periodic-review setting throughout our analysis. Compared with tradi-
tional periodic-review inventory rationing models, we assume that the seller allocates
goods upon the arrival of a customer (in real time) rather than dispatches goods to
customers when all demands are realized. This is of practical interest, as Ding et al.
(2006) point out, because “in most practical cases, demand arrives according to a
continuous-time stochastic process during a period and ﬁrms are required to respond
to demands immediately.” In our models, the inventory dynamics depend on the
arrival sequence of both short and long lead-time customers and the admission con-
trol deployed.

Examples from Industry
Abstract In this chapter, we provide a number of industry examples of how ﬁrms
implement the strategy of ﬂexible delivery times. The ﬁrst example is Toyota China’s
dealerships. Dealerships use a price- and delivery-time-based segmentation strategy
to ameliorate the supply-demand imbalance due to inaccurate demand forecast and
a rigid production schedule. We also discuss examples such as multiple shipping
options offered by online retailers and the priority queue system as commonly seen
in the service industry. In all of these examples, ﬁrms segment customers based
on their price and delivery-time sensitivities, and the critical question is how ﬁrms
should implement the strategy optimally in a dynamically changing context. This
question is elucidated by the theoretical discussion in the following chapters.
2.1
Introduction
Flexible delivery-time options have much practical value and can be widely seen
in business practices. Firms make use of these options when they have limited
inventories, have trouble in adjusting their production capacities to keep up with
surging demand, or simply would like to improve on market segmentation. Delivery-
time options segment customers based on their price and delivery-time sensitivities.
Firms can thus generate a higher revenue from the on-hand inventory because this
speciﬁc separating strategy, as noted by Shugan (2002), allows them to “keep price-
insensitive customers buying at the peak period” for a higher margin and “shift only
price-sensitive customers to the off-peak period” (peak periods are periods in which
the demand far exceeds the capacity, and off-peak periods are deﬁned as the opposite).
This chapter introduces a number of industry examples of the delivery-time seg-
mentation strategy. Section2.2 presents in detail the practice at Toyota China’s deal-
erships. Dealerships use ﬂexible delivery times to ameliorate the supply-demand
imbalance caused by forecasting inaccuracy and rigid production schedules. We use
data collected from this dealership example later in our numerical studies. Section2.3
discusses several other examples, in which ﬂexible delivery times beneﬁt ﬁrms in
a variety of ways. In Sect.2.4, we summarize the managerial implications of these
examples and conclude the chapter.

Toyota China’s Automobile Dealerships
In this section, we introduce the practice of ﬂexible delivery times adopted by
Toyota China’s dealerships. In recent years, we have observed that pricing and
delivery-time considerations are playing an increasingly important role in the sell-
ing of cars in China. In the fast-growing Chinese automobile market, competition
between automobile supply chains, consisting mainly of automobile manufacturers
and dealerships, has also intensiﬁed. In particular, the strategy for automobile sup-
ply chains has changed from a simple strategy of access to the market (placement)
to a customer-focused strategy (product and price), in which providing a number of
different delivery-time options along with differentiated pricing is a tool for maximiz-
ing revenue and expanding market share. In the following, we describe how Toyota
China’s dealerships make use of ﬂexible delivery times to handle the supply-demand
imbalance.
2.2.1
Toyota in the Chinese Automobile Market
The automobile industry is one of the most important economic sectors in the world.
Based on the total number of vehicles produced in 2005 (66 million), it was estimated
that the global turnover of the automobile industry was equivalent to 1.9 trillion
euros. The industry also created over 8 million jobs directly, representing more
than 5% of the world’s total manufacturing employment, and about ﬁve times more
jobs indirectly. According to a study of 26 countries conducted by the International
Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA), vehicle manufacturing and
usage contributed more than 433 billion euros to government revenues.1
The automobile industry in China has a history dating back to the ﬁrst Five-
Year Plan (1953–1957). In 1953, First Automobile Works (FAW) was founded in
Changchun, the capital of Jilin province. In the more than ﬁve decades since then,
and especially since 1978, when China began its economic reform (also known as
“reform and opening up”), China’s automobile industry has gradually grown into a
pillaroftheeconomyandhasbecomeoneofthemostimportantintheworld.Between
2000 and 2011, it recorded an average annual growth rate of 22%, much higher than
the average global growth rate during the same period. Only in 2008 did China post
a single-digit growth rate, due to the global ﬁnancial crisis. The contribution of the
automobile industry to the gross domestic product (GDP) in China has increased
from 1.50% in 2005 to 2.61% in 2010.2 In 2009, China surpassed Japan to become
the top automobile producing country and also topped the United States to become
the largest automobile market in the world. Nevertheless, the car penetration rate

(CPR, measured as cars per thousand people) is still quite low compared with that
of the developed countries, indicating huge potential in this market.
China’s automobile manufacturers were originally state-owned, either by the cen-
tral government, such as FAW and Second Automobile Works (Dongfeng Motors),
or by local governments, such as the Beijing Automotive Industry Corporation
(BAIC), Chang’an Auto, Guangzhou Auto, and Fujian Auto. With the beginning
of the economic reform in 1978, the government started to allow the operation of
private automakers and joint ventures with foreign automakers. The ﬁrst joint ven-
ture was Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Co., Ltd. (SVW), established between
Volkswagen (VW) and the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (now SAIC
Motor) in 1984. Although there were some conﬂicts in the process of collaboration,
this form of joint venture was widely considered a “win-win” for both sides: for-
eign automakers could gain entry into the promising Chinese market, lower their
production costs through localization of production, and enjoy some policy beneﬁts,
and local manufacturers could gain access to the advanced technology, management,
and marketing expertise of the foreign partner and capitalize on established foreign
brands. In 2011, the top 10 manufacturers sold 6,472,200 cars, accounting for 64%
of total car sales. Eight of them were joint ventures.
As one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers, Toyota Motor Corpo-
ration began exporting cars (starting with the Crown sedan) to China in early 1964.
However, the localization of production got off to a late start compared with its rivals.
Its ﬁrst joint venture, Tianjin Toyota Motor Engine Co., Ltd., started operating in
only 1988. In the same year, Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. was founded,
and produced the ﬁrst locally produced Toyota vehicle, the Coaster bus, four years
later than its main competitor, the VW Group. Since then, Toyota has hastened its
expansion. For each model, Toyota’s usual strategy is to import ﬁrst and then decide
whether to localize production depending on the model’s popularity. In 2003, the
Sichuan plant began to produce the Land Cruiser Prado. In 2004, Toyota established
ajointventure,GACToyotaMotorCo.,Ltd.,withtheGuangzhouAutomobile(GAC)
Group to produce the Camry in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province and
the largest regional automobile market in China. In 2009, Toyota decided to localize
the production of its popular SUV model, the Highlander, in GAC-Toyota. By 2011,
Toyota had localized the production of 19 sub-brands in China. Its market share in
China was 5%, compared with 18% in the United States and more than 40% in
Japan. Despite the low market share, the Toyota Camry, RAV4, and Highlander are
among China’s top sellers in the higher price ranges.
2.2.2
Toyota China’s Production Planning
To make the best use of Toyota’s highly efﬁcient production system, the real challenge
lies in accurately forecasting demand and planning production accordingly. This
is extremely difﬁcult in a rapidly growing market such as China, particularly for
newly introduced models with no historical sales data. Toyota China holds a sales

Examples from Industry
convention at the end of each ﬁscal year, that gathers major sales representatives
from across China. One important mission of this convention is to collect the dealers’
replenishment plans for the coming year, which should include both the total quantity
and detailed numbers of speciﬁc models and conﬁgurations for each month. Toyota
then determines the yearly quota for each dealer based on the numbers submitted and
the consolidated sales in the past year. The general production plan for the coming
year is arranged correspondingly. During implementation, Toyota China can make
adjustments to the general plan according to the realized sales.
Toyota China has adopted a multi-level management structure. Regional sales
managers are responsible for all of the sub-regions within their regions. They deter-
mine an overall quota and then allocate the quota among the sub-region dealers. When
the demand is realized, they can also arrange transshipments between sub-regions if
necessary. This centralized management helps to achieve coordination between deal-
ers. Dealers also enjoy a certain amount of ﬂexibility in demand realization. They
must inform Toyota China of their replenishment quantities 3 months in advance,
and can then adjust the quantity by up to 10% until 2 months before delivery, and
specify colors up to one month before delivery.
However, although adjustable production and replenishment can help to alleviate
the risks of overstock and shortage, the effect is still limited. For instance, the High-
lander, a popular SUV model, began local production in China in early 2009. During
our ﬁeld study at GAC-Toyota, we found that in the ﬁrst half of 2009, the number of
Highlanders ordered by dealerships was 60% higher and the actual realized demand
was 90% higher than Toyota China’s projected demand. As some core parts were
imported and the capacity was constrained, Toyota China was unable to increase its
production in time to fully satisfy the surging demand. Toyota China responded to
the supply shortage by expanding production of the Highlander in September 2009,
although there was already a long lag. The inevitable result was a prolonged delay
in the delivery time to customers: up to 3–6 months compared with the usual one
month or less.
2.2.3
Demand Management and Selling Strategies
at Dealerships
Like other foreign automakers, the majority of Toyota’s marketing, distribution and
sales operations in China are conducted by its joint venture dealerships. The dealer-
ships are called 4S stores (sales, spare parts, service, and surveys) and are designed to
provide integrated services to customers. According to Toyota, by the end of 2009 it
had around 650 4S stores in China, forming the distribution network for its vehicles.
4S stores currently generate most of their proﬁts from new-vehicle sales.
We illustrate the normal operations of a 4S store in Fig.2.1. The evolutionary Cus-
tomer Relationship Building (e-CRB) system is an in-house customer relationship
management system used by Toyota China’s dealerships. Its two key components

are the intelligent Customer Relationship Optimization Program (i-CROP) and the
Total Arranging and Cultivating (TACT) system. The i-CROP is responsible for the
management of customer information, and the TACT system is the interface between
dealerships and Toyota China. The customer tracking block classiﬁes customers into
four classes (A, B, C, and D) according to their intended purchasing times. This
classiﬁcation is usually based on a subjective estimation made by 4S store clerks.
A detailed description of the classiﬁcation system is provided in Table2.1. Once
orders are placed, dealerships use the TACT system to track them until ﬁnal delivery.
According to the 2-month data we collected from a typical 4S store, about 20% of
the in-store customers who purchased the Highlander belonged to classes A and B,
and the rest were split evenly between classes C and D.
The interests of Toyota China and its 4S stores are not always perfectly aligned.
For example, Toyota China would like to maintain central control over decisions
such as pricing, bundling sales, and cross-regional transshipments to avoid image
damage and malicious competition, and 4S stores would like to have more ﬂexibil-
ity in these decisions. This interest misalignment is particularly prominent when a
supply-demand imbalance emerges. As Toyota China cannot fully address the sup-
ply shortage by increasing its production, the dealerships must make the best use of
their limited inventories to retain customers. In the case of a supply-demand imbal-
ance, dealerships commonly switch to a market segmentation strategy characterized

14
2
Examples from Industry
by price and delivery-time differentiation. Two purchasing options are offered to
customers: spot and consignment. By choosing the spot option, customers get their
desiredcarsimmediatelyfromtheon-handinventoryattheexpenseofpayingahigher
price, buying a bundled insurance product, or upgrading the conﬁguration. By choos-
ing the consignment option, customers pay the manufacturer’s suggested retail price
(MSRP) and are put on a waiting list, with delivery usually taking 2–3 months. How-
ever, because the “mark-up” associated with the spot option is often determined by
dealerships themselves based on the prevailing supply-demand condition, it varies
from time to time and from place to place. This has caused a lot of controversy
among customers, with some of them even blaming Toyota China for intentionally
creating a shortage to rip off customers. Setting aside the controversy, the dealerships
that carry out such selling strategies can ameliorate the supply-demand imbalance to
some extent; however, they must also deal with extra complexity because they must
decide not only whether to accept an order, but also when to fulﬁll the order.
2.3
Other Examples
Cases similar to the preceding dealership example can be found elsewhere, notably
the selling of the iPhone in China.3 Similar to popular car models, the initial demand
for a new iPhone model upon its release can far exceed its supply. As a result, sales
must be rationed, and a large proportion of customers are left unfulﬁlled. However,
unlike the dealership example, because Apple itself does not adjust the price or
provide customers with multiple delivery options, the market segmentation is carried
out by scalpers. Scalpers are usually better at getting newly released iPhones than
normal customers. They then immediately put the iPhones they purchased up for sale
at a higher price. Hence, a normal customer has two options: he/she can either buy a
new iPhone from scalpers right away at a higher price or wait until the initial frenzy
fades away, which may take months.
Flexible delivery times may also appear in other forms. For example, it is now a
common practice for online retailers such as Amazon.com to offer multiple shipping
options to customers. In this case, the scarce resource is the shipping capacity rather
than the physical inventory. Shipping capacity is perishable and cannot be carried
over. Instead of serving all orders on a priority rules (FCFS) basis, online retailers
provide expedited shipping to some priority orders and standard shipping to others.
To enjoy the expedited shipping service, however, customers must pay a premium.
Compared with the traditional shipping approach, which treats all orders equally, the
main merit of multiple shipping options comes from a reﬁned market segmentation
based on customers’ heterogeneous delivery-time requirements.
In addition to the preceding manufacturing and retailing examples, the application
of ﬂexible delivery times can be found in the service industry. The delivery time
now corresponds to the delay between when customers arrive and when they are

served. A common example is the priority queue system, which is visible at banks,
boarding gates, highways, etc.4 Although a faster service may not be the only reason
why customers are willing to pay a premium, it is an important one. Similar to
the preceding shipping example, service providers give higher priority to customers
who pay to be served ahead of others. Although priority customers can enjoy faster
service, normal customers who do not pay are worse off (e.g., they must wait longer).
Service providers must decide how to reserve their capacities for different classes of
customers.
2.4
Concluding Remarks
Itisnowwellacknowledgedthatcustomersarebothpriceanddelivery-timesensitive.
Although manufacturers and retailers are striving to fulﬁll customers’ orders as soon
as possible, there are times when the demand can far exceed the supply and a delay
is inevitable. Flexible delivery-time options are an effective means to cope with such
situations. As seen in preceding example, because Toyota China is unable to respond
to the surging demand in time, dealerships resort to multiple delivery-time options
themselves by charging a premium for spot delivery. Even when supply-demand
imbalance is not a major concern, ﬁrms can make use of ﬂexible delivery times to
improve their revenue. As seen in the examples in the retailing and service industries,
ﬁrms offer multiple delivery-time options to customers or assign higher priority to
those customers who are willing to pay a premium to get the service faster.
In all of the examples discussed in this chapter, the ﬁrms’ optimal strategies are
not ﬁxed. That is, both the optimal selling strategy in the dealership example and
the optimal capacity allocation strategy in the service-industry examples are contin-
gent on the inventory/capacity status and on realized and future demands. Hence,
ﬁrms need to adjust their execution of the strategy dynamically. In the following
chapters, our theoretical discussions provide an analytical framework for analyzing
the preceding examples in terms of how ﬁrms should derive their optimal policies
dynamically.
The example in Sect.2.2 is based on Liang et al. (2013).

Inventory Models with Two Delivery-Time
Options
Abstract In this chapter, we consider a multi-period inventory model in which a
seller provides alternative delivery lead-time choices to customers: a short lead time
and a long lead time. In addition to the cyclic inventory replenishment decision,
the seller makes the inventory commitment decision, i.e., whether to use a unit of
on-hand inventory to satisfy a long lead-time customer immediately. We ﬁrst
characterize the optimal inventory commitment and replenishment policies in a
non-capacitated setting. The optimal inventory commitment policy is subject to a
commitment level, and the optimal replenishment policy is of a base-stock type.
We then consider an extended model with a supply-capacity constraint, in which the
commitment policy further includes rejections of short and long lead-time orders. We
show that the optimal inventory commitment policy for short lead-time customers
is characterized by a switching commitment level and that the optimal inventory
commitment policy for long lead-time customers is characterized by three switch-
ing commitment levels. We then compare the performance of the optimal dynamic
commitment policy with that of a static rationing policy through numerical studies.
3.1
Introduction
In this chapter, we consider a multi-period inventory model in which a seller provides
alternative lead-time choices to customers: a short lead time and a long lead time. The
model addresses the real-world problem that ﬁrms face when serving customers who
can be either patient (slow) or impatient (fast). For example, a supplier for clothing
retailers may serve both fashion retailers such as H&M and Zara and traditional
retailers such as the Gap. Fashion retailers strive to cut their lead times to realize
their quick response programs and achieve a shorter operational cycle. Traditional
retailers have fewer incentives and encounter more difﬁculties in adopting quick
response programs; thus, they operate with a longer operational cycle (Caro and
Martínez-de Albéniz 2010). Hence, the supplier deals with slow and fast orders
together. Orders taken by suppliers from slow customers can be included in the next
production cycle, and orders from fast customers must be satisﬁed from the on-hand
inventory.

Inventory Models with Two Delivery-Time Options
We deﬁne a short lead-time customer as one that pays a higher price and requires
immediate delivery and a long lead-time customer as one that pays a lower price and
acceptsalatedeliverysothatthesellercanchoosethedeliverytimeatitsconvenience.
Note that the seller has its own lead time on the supply side. We assume that the
supply-side lead time is shorter than the lead time of long lead-time customers, but
longer than the lead time of short lead-time customers. In addition to the traditional
replenishment decision, which is made in cycles, the seller can choose to use the
on-hand inventory to satisfy long lead-time customers, which we call an inventory
commitment decision. The inventory commitment decision is made on the spot upon
the arrival of an order.
We ﬁrst characterize the optimal inventory commitment and replenishment poli-
cies in a non-capacitated setting. We show that the optimal inventory commitment
policy is determined by a switching commitment level and that the optimal replen-
ishment policy is of a base-stock type. We then extend our analysis to investigate the
case in which there exists a supply capacity constraint. In the capacitated model, we
show that the optimal inventory commitment for short lead-time customers is char-
acterized by a threshold level, which determines whether the seller should accept
or reject short lead-time customers. We also show that the optimal inventory com-
mitment for long lead-time customers is characterized by three commitment levels.
These levels determine whether the seller should accept a long lead-time customer
and, if the customer is accepted, whether it should use on-hand inventory to satisfy
that customer on the spot. To further illustrate the advantage of the optimal inven-
tory commitment policy, we compare its performance with that of a static inventory
rationing policy.
In the remainder of this chapter, Sect.3.2 presents the notation and formulation of
the problem. In Sect.3.3, we derive the optimal inventory commitment and replen-
ishment policies, ﬁrst in a non-capacitated setting and then in a capacitated setting.
Section3.4 illustrates the performance of the dynamic commitment policy using
numerical examples. Section3.5 concludes the chapter.
3.2
Notation and Model Formulation
Consider a single-product, ﬁnite-time-horizon, periodic-review inventory system that
provides two delivery options to its customers: delivery immediately or delivery in
the next cycle. At the beginning of each reviewing cycle, the seller replenishes its
inventory. Unused inventory is carried over to the next cycle. There are two classes of
customers: short and long lead-time customers. When a customer arrives, the seller
commits its inventory based on the preference of the customer. If the customer is a
short lead-time customer, the seller must satisfy the order with its on-hand inventory.
If the customer is a long lead-time customer, the seller can either satisfy the customer
now or delay the delivery until the next cycle. Short lead-time customers pay a higher
price for the immediate delivery. For now, we assume that the prices of the two

3.2 Notation and Model Formulation

delivery options are given. The pricing decision is incorporated and discussed in
Chap.5.
For analytical convenience, following the technique used by Bitran and Mond-
schein (1997), we divide an inventory cycle into small periods and assume that each
period is short enough that at most one customer arrives. Customer arrival is quan-
tiﬁed by probabilities. If a short lead-time customer arrives, he/she places an order
and expects the order to be delivered immediately. Unﬁlled demand from short lead-
time customers is lost if not satisﬁed immediately. We assume that there is no cost
incurred by the short-demand loss due to stock-out. If a long lead-time customer
arrives, he/she places an order and expects the order to be delivered before the next
cycle. We start with a non-capacitated model. Hence, all short lead-time customers
are satisﬁed as long as there is still on-hand inventory, and all long lead-time cus-
tomers can be satisﬁed at the beginning of the next cycle when the seller replenishes
its inventory. At the end of each cycle, the holding cost is calculated, and in the last
cycle, the leftover inventory is salvaged.
We introduce the following notation:
{1, 2, . . . , T } the T periods in a cycle;
n(t) the on-hand inventory in period t;
m(t) the outstanding long orders, i.e., the amount of the product
promised for delivery by the next cycle in period t;
ps the price of the immediate-delivery option;
p f the price of the late-delivery option;
πs the probability of a short lead-time customer in a period;
π f the probability of a long lead-time customer in a period;
π0 the probability of no customer in a period;
c the unit purchasing cost;
h the unit holding cost; and
s the unit salvage value.
We assume that the following relations hold:
ps > p f > c > s, and πs + π f + π0 = 1.
Note that the seller can choose to fulﬁll long lead-time customers with on-hand
inventory. This inventory commitment decision is represented by u(t).
u(t) =
1, satisfy the long lead-time order with on-hand inventory;
0, satisfy the long lead-time order in the next cycle.

Inventory Models with Two Delivery-Time Options
To maximize the proﬁt in this inventory system with alternative lead-time options, it
is necessary to ﬁrst derive the optimal dynamic inventory commitment policy u(t),
which may be contingent on t, n(t), and m(t). After obtaining the optimal inven-
tory commitment policy, we can continue to address the issue of optimal inventory
stocking, i.e., to characterize the optimal inventory replenishment policy.
3.3
Optimal Inventory Commitment and Replenishment
Policies
In this section, we ﬁrst develop the seller’s optimal inventory commitment policy
within a cycle and then characterize the optimal inventory replenishment policy at
the beginning of each cycle. Finally, we revisit these optimal policies in the presence
of a supply capacity constraint.
3.3.1
Optimal Inventory Commitment Policy
As mentioned earlier, because ps > p f and there is no capacity constraint, the seller
should always satisfy short lead-time orders as long as the on-hand inventory is
non-zero. However, it is critical to time the fulﬁllment of orders from long lead-time
customers. Let V (t, n, m) be the value function in period t with the on-hand inventory
level n(t) and the promised-for-delivery level m(t). When n(t) = 0, neither long
lead-time nor short lead-time customers can be satisﬁed in the current cycle. As a
result, orders from short lead-time customers are lost, and orders from long lead-time
customers are scheduled for delivery in the next cycle. The seller obtains a revenue
of p f from each long lead-time customer. Hence, for 1 ≤t < T ,
V (t, 0, m) = (π0 + πs)V (t + 1, 0, m) + π f (p f + V (t + 1, 0, m + 1)),
and
V (T, 0, m) = −cm.
Based on the preceding two equations, a little calculation shows that
V (t, 0, m) = (T −t)π f (p f −c) −cm.
When n(t) ≥1, the dynamic programming equation for 1 ≤t < T is
V (t, n, m) =π0V (t + 1, n, m) + π f max
u∈{0,1}{V (t + 1, n −u, m + 1 −u)}
+ πsV (t + 1, n −1, m) + π f p f + πs ps,
(3.1)

3.3 Optimal Inventory Commitment and Replenishment Policies
21
and the terminal value function is
V (T, n, m) = −c(m −n)+ −hn + s(n −m)+.
(3.2)
Eq. (3.1) indicates that to obtain the optimal inventory commitment policy, it is
necessary to compare the value functions of two possible actions: using a unit of
on-hand inventory to satisfy the long lead-time customer immediately, or promising
to deliver in the next cycle. The following lemma provides the monotonicity property
of the difference between these two actions. All proofs are relegated to the appendix.
Lemma 3.1 (a) For a given m, V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m + 1) is non-decreasing
in n; that is, V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m + 1) ≤V (t, n, m) −V (t, n + 1, m + 1).
(b) For a given n, V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m + 1) is independent of m; that is,
V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m + 1) = V (t, n −1, m + 1) −V (t, n, m + 2).
Part (a) of Lemma 3.1 indicates that the greater the on-hand inventory is, the
better it is for the seller to use a unit of on-hand inventory to satisfy the long lead-
time customer. Moreover, part (b) reveals that this decision is independent of the
promised-for-delivery inventory level m. The commitment policy depends on the
trade-off between the inventory holding cost for one unit of product and the possible
proﬁt from selling it to a short lead-time customer. As the revenue from a long lead-
time customer does not change even if the seller delivers the product immediately,
the promised-for-delivery level does not play into the tradeoff.
We now present a theorem that characterizes the optimal dynamic inventory com-
mitment policy. Its proof is similar to that of Lemma 3.1. We can obtain the desired
results by checking different cases of the term maxu={0,1}{V (t, n −u, m + 1 −u)}
in (3.1).
Theorem 3.1 (a) The optimal inventory commitment policy is characterized by a
switching commitment level CL(t). The commitment level CL(t) equals 0 if V (t +
1, 0, m)−V (t +1, 1, m +1) ≥0; otherwise, it is deﬁned as the maximum value of n
such that V (t+1, n−1, m)−V (t+1, n, m+1) ≤0. Moreover, the commitment level
is independent of the promised-for-delivery level m and has a continuity property in
relation to the period index t, i.e., CL(t) ≤CL(t −1) ≤CL(t) + 1.

n(t) > CL(t); otherwise, to promise to deliver orders from long lead-time customers
in the next cycle. That is,
u∗(t) =
1, if n(t) > CL(t);
0, otherwise.
Theorem 3.1 characterizes the optimal inventory commitment policy for orders
from long lead-time customers. The commitment policy allows the seller to balance
the trade-off between using on-hand inventory and using replenished inventory in
the next cycle. The former reduces the inventory-holding cost, and the latter reserves
on-hand inventory for future short lead-time customers in the rest of the cycle.

Inventory Models with Two Delivery-Time Options
3.3.2
Optimal Inventory Replenishment Policy
In our preceding analysis, we obtain the optimal inventory commitment policy for
the seller in a selling cycle. We now extend our study to investigate the existence
and form of the optimal inventory replenishment policy. We start with a single-cycle
problem. We ﬁrst prove the following lemma.
Lemma 3.2 The value function V (t, n, m) satisﬁes the following properties:
P1 V (t, n, m) is concave in n for a given m;
P2 V (t, n, m) is concave in m for a given n; and
P3 V (t, n, m) is supermodular in (n, m).
The supermodularity of V (t, n, m) in relation to (n, m) implies that the on-hand
inventory and outstanding long orders are economic complements.
Suppose that at the beginning of the cycle the seller has an initial inventory n(0).
It then makes a replenishment to bring up the inventory to a desired level n(1), which
can be determined as follows:
max
n(1)≥n(0){V (1, n(1), 0) −c[n(1) −n(0)]}
= cn(0) +
max
n(1)≥n(0){V (1, n(1), 0) −cn(1)}.
According to Lemma 3.2, V (1, n(1), 0) satisﬁes the property of P1. We thus can
characterize the optimal inventory replenishment policy in the following theorem.
Theorem 3.2 The optimal inventory replenishment policy is of a base-stock type.
The optimal order-up-to level, denoted by y∗, is the maximizer of V (1, n(1), 0) −
c[n(1) −n(0)] and independent of the initial inventory n(0). The optimal ordering
quantity, denoted by q∗, is
q∗=
 y∗−n(0), if n(0) ≤y∗,
0,
if n(0) > y∗.
3.3.3
Optimal Policies with a Supply-Capacity Constraint
In this subsection, we consider the effect of a supply-capacity constraint on the opti-
mal policies. The capacity constraint can be caused by the replenishment lead time.
We assume that the replenishment lead time is one cycle. That is, a replenishment
order placed in a cycle becomes available in the next cycle. Due to the capacity
constraint, orders from long lead-time customers are no longer freely backlogged
and satisﬁed in the next cycle, and orders from short lead-time customers may also
be rejected. Hence, the model with a capacity constraint includes the following fea-
tures: (1) unsatisﬁed long lead-time orders are subject to a penalty cost, and (2) the

3.3 Optimal Inventory Commitment and Replenishment Policies
23
inventory commitment policy also considers possibilities of rejecting short and long
lead-time orders.
Denote the replenishment quantity and penalty cost for each unfulﬁlled long lead-
time order as Q and cp, respectively. Let V Q(t, n, m) be the value function in period
t (1 ≤t < T ) with the on-hand inventory level n(t) and the promised-for-delivery
level m(t).
V Q(t, n, m) =π0V Q(t + 1, n, m) + πs max{V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) + ps, V Q(t + 1, n, m)}
+ π f max{V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) + p f , V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) + p f ,
V Q(t + 1, n, m)},
(3.3)
with a terminal value function
V Q(T, n, m) = −hn + s(n + Q −m)+ −cp(m −n −Q)+.
(3.4)
Eq. (3.3) indicates that when a long lead-time customer arrives, the seller chooses
from three possible actions: using a unit of on-hand inventory to satisfy the customer
immediately, promising to deliver the order in the next cycle, or rejecting the order.
When a short lead-time customer arrives, the seller chooses whether to use a unit
of on-hand inventory to satisfy the customer immediately or reject the order. The
following lemma proves the monotonicity properties of the value function.
Lemma 3.3 (a) For a given m, V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) is
non-decreasing in n; and for a given n, V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1)
is non-decreasing in m.
(b) For a given m, V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m) is non-decreasing in
n (concavity in n); and for a given n, V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m) is
non-increasing in m (supermodular).
(c) For a given m, V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) −V Q(t + 1, n, m) is non-decreasing
in n (supermodular); and for a given n, V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) −V Q(t + 1, n, m) is
non-increasing in m (concavity in m).
Similar to the results we obtain in the basic model, the supermodularity of V (t, n, m)
in (n, m) reveals that the on-hand inventory and promised-for-delivery orders are still
economic complements in the presence of a capacity constraint. To characterize the
optimal inventory commitment policy for long lead-time customers, we introduce
the following deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (a) For each m, a commitment level CL1(t, m) equals 0 if V Q(t +
1, 0, m) −V Q(t + 1, 1, m + 1) ≥0; otherwise, the commitment level is deﬁned as
the maximum value of n such that V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) ≤0.
(b) For each m, a commitment level CL2(t, m) equals 0 if V Q(t +1, 0, m)+ p f −
V Q(t + 1, 1, m) ≥0; otherwise, the commitment level is deﬁned as the maximum
value of n such that V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) + p f −V Q(t + 1, n, m) ≤0.
(c) For each m, a commitment level CL3(t, m) equals 0 if V Q(t + 1, 0, m +
1) + p f −V Q(t + 1, 0, m) ≥0; otherwise, the commitment level is deﬁned as the
maximum value of n such that V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) + p f −V Q(t + 1, n, m) ≤0.

Inventory Models with Two Delivery-Time Options
(d) For each m, a commitment level CL4(t, m) equals 0 if V Q(t +1, 0, m)+ ps −
V Q(t + 1, 1, m) ≥0; otherwise, the commitment level is deﬁned as the maximum
value of n such that V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) + ps −V Q(t + 1, n, m) ≤0.
Based on the preceding lemma and deﬁnitions, we can characterize the optimal
inventory commitment policies for both long and short lead-time customers.
Theorem 3.3 (a) In period t, for long lead-time customers, the optimal inven-
tory commitment policy is characterized by three switching commitment levels, i.e.,
CL1(t, m), CL2(t, m), and CL3(t, m); and for short lead-time customers, the optimal
inventory-commitment policy is characterized by CL4(t, m).
(b) The commitment level CL1(t, m) is non-increasing in m, and commitment
levels CL2(t, m), CL3(t, m), and CL4(t, m) are non-decreasing in m.
(c) min{CL1(t, m), CL3(t, m)} ≤CL2(t, m) ≤max{CL1(t, m), CL3(t, m)}. That
is, if CL1(t, m) = CL3(t, m), then CL1(t, m) = CL3(t, m) = CL2(t, m).
(d) When CL1(t, m) > CL3(t, m), the optimal inventory commitment policy for
long lead-time customers is to satisfy orders immediately if n(t) > CL1(t, m), to
promise to deliver orders in the next cycle if CL2(t, m) < n(t) ≤CL1(t, m), and to
reject orders otherwise.
(e) When CL1(t, m) ≤CL3(t, m), the optimal inventory commitment policy for
long lead-time customers is to satisfy orders immediately if n(t) > CL2(t, m), and
to reject orders otherwise.
( f ) The optimal inventory commitment policy for short lead-time customers is to
satisfy orders immediately if n(t) > CL4(t, m), and to reject orders otherwise.
Theorem 3.3 summarizes the optimal inventory commitment policies with a supply-
capacity constraint. The optimal policies for short and long lead-time customers are
illustrated in Figs.3.1 and 3.2, respectively. For short lead-time customers, if the
on-hand inventory level is high and the promised-for-delivery level is low, the seller
has a low risk of running out of the capacity and should satisfy the orders of short
lead-time customers using on-hand inventory. If, however, the on-hand inventory
level is low and the promsied-for-delivery level is high, the seller should reject the
orders of short lead-time customers.
For long lead-time customers, if the on-hand inventory and promised-for-delivery
levels are both low, i.e., region I in Fig.3.2, the seller should promise to deliver the
long lead-time order in the next cycle. If the on-hand inventory level is low and the
promised-for-delivery level is high, i.e., region II in Fig.3.2, the seller has a higher
chance of running out of capacity and should reject the long lead-time order. If the
on-hand inventory level is high, i.e., region III in Fig.3.2, the seller should satisfy
the long lead-time order immediately using on-hand inventory.
In addition, from (c) in Theorem 3.3, we know that the three switching commit-
ment curves intersect at one point because at each switching commitment curve there
are two actions leading to the same proﬁt and the seller has three possible actions.
This observation implies that we can simplify the control policies by approximat-
ing the switching curves with straight lines, as shown by the dotted line in Fig.3.2.
To implement the approximation, we need to locate the following three points: the

former two intersections can be calculated by searching the n that makes the two

the two terms V Q(t + 1, 0, m + 1) + p f and V Q(t + 1, 0, m) equal, respectively.

makes the three terms V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) + p f , V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) + p f , and
V Q(t + 1, n, m) equal.

Inventory Models with Two Delivery-Time Options
The following theorem further summarizes the relationship between the optimal
inventory commitment policy and the supply capacity Q.
Theorem 3.4 For a given promised-for-delivery level m,
(a) V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) is non-increasing in Q.
(b) V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m) is non-decreasing in Q.
(c) V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) −V Q(t + 1, n, m) is non-decreasing in Q.
(d) when Q increases, CL1(t, m) does not change or becomes larger (moves upward
and rightward in Fig.3.2, and CL2(t, m) and CL3(t, m) do not change or become
smaller (move downward and rightward in Fig.3.2.
When the supply capacity Q increases, the seller is more likely to satisfy orders
immediately or promises to deliver orders to the next cycle. As Fig.3.2 shows,
rejection-region II diminishes and promised-for-delivery region I expands. When
Q goes to inﬁnity, the capacitated model is reduced to the basic non-capacitated
model, and rejection-region II disappears.
3.4
Study of the Inventory Rationing and Inventory
Commitment Policies
In Theorem 3.1, we prove that the optimal inventory commitment policy for long
lead-time customers can be characterized by a time-dependent switching commit-
ment level. In the inventory-rationing literature, it is common to adopt the inventory
rationing policy, i.e., to choose a static value that deﬁnes the maximum number of
orders to be reserved for each demand class. Cattani and Souza (2002) compare the
performance of such an inventory rationing policy with that of a priority rules policy
and show that the former outperforms the latter. In contrast to the static inventory
rationing policy, the inventory commitment policy in our model accepts orders based
on a dynamic commitment level. In this section, we carry out a study to compare the
performance of these two policies.
According to Theorem 3.1, the inventory commitment policy is deﬁned by an
optimal commitment level CL(t) in each period. The commitment level varies in
relation to t (see Fig.3.3 for an illustration). The seller commits one unit of the
on-hand inventory to a long lead-time customer as long as the on-hand inventory
level is higher than the commitment level. The inventory rationing policy, in contrast,
depends on one static inventory rationing level. With the prevailing probabilities of
the demand classes listed in Table3.1, we calculate the proﬁts under the dynamic
and static policies. Note that the optimal inventory rationing level is obtained by a
complete enumeration. Assume that p f = αps and α ≤1. We use α as the price-
decline rate. Let ps = 100, c = 70, and s = 20. We use the single-cycle model to
carry out numerical experiments for different values of h and α.
Let α = 0.95. We calculate the optimal inventory commitment levels in Fig.3.3,
which are non-increasing in relation to t. We obtain the optimal proﬁt in relation to
the different inventory holding costs in Table3.2. The inventory rationing policy is

implemented by enumerating the rationing level. The improvement ratio is deﬁned
as the uniﬁed proﬁt difference between the two policies divided by the proﬁt of the
inventory rationing policy. Then, we let h = 50 and change α to obtain the optimal
proﬁts and improvement ratio in Table3.3. From Tables3.2 and 3.3, we can see that
the optimal proﬁt for the inventory commitment policy is greater than that of the
inventory rationing policy, and the improvement ratio is greater than 4%.
Furthermore, we reduce the horizon length to 8 and obtain the proﬁts for the
inventory commitment and inventory rationing policies as 193.91 and 190.24, respec-
tively. The improvement ratio is 1.9 %, which is smaller than the improvement ratio
when the horizon length equals 16. This observation is intuitive. As discussed after
Theorem 3.1, we indicate that the inventory commitment levels are time-dependent.
A smaller t leads to a higher commitment level. Hence, the inventory commitment
levels vary in a longer horizon. This demonstrates that the beneﬁt of deploying the
inventory commitment policy increases as the length of the cycle increases.

Robustness of the Inventory Commitment Policy
From Fig.3.3, the trajectories of the optimal inventory commitment policies seem
to suggest that the optimal commitment levels are less sensitive in relation to the
holding-cost parameter h. This implies that the inventory commitment policy can be
deployed even when the value of the holding cost is uncertain or difﬁcult to obtain.
Now, we carry out a numerical experiment to verify this observation. This experiment
enables us to quantify the performance changes when an estimated holding-cost para-
meter is used to derive the inventory commitment policy. Table3.2 shows that when
the inventory-holding cost h = 60, the optimal proﬁts for the inventory rationing and
inventory commitment policies are 308.09 and 321.12, respectively. We assume that
the holding cost for the problem under investigation is h = 60. However, the seller
uses the dynamic inventory commitment policies derived for h = 70 and h = 50, and
the corresponding proﬁts are 320.65 and 321.10, respectively. Hence, a 1/6 change
in the inventory holding cost yields a less than 0.15 % change in the proﬁt. In addi-
tion, the dominance over the performance of inventory rationing is maintained. We
believe that this observation results for two reasons: the inventory commitment pol-
icy dynamically changes the on-hand inventory over the entire cycle, and the ending
inventory is consistently lower. As the inventory-holding cost applies only to the
ending inventory, it is rational to expect such a performance.

We also change the demand rates in the periods. We use the demand rates in
Table3.1 as the benchmark probabilities. We ﬁrst ﬁx πs and let π f have a decrease
(increase) of max{0.05, π′

s}). We then ﬁx π f , and let πs have
a decrease (increase) of max{0.05, π′
s} (min{0.05, 1 −π′
f }). Let α = 0.95 and
h = 70. We compare the inventory commitment levels for the decrease/increase
in the long lead-time demand model, the decrease/increase in the short lead-time
demand model, and the benchmark case presented in Fig.3.4. The proﬁts for these
inventory-commitment policies are listed in Table3.4, in which the change rate is
equal to the proﬁt difference divided by the optimal proﬁt. The results demonstrate
that the degree of proﬁt change is marginal. We believe that the downward slope of
the commitment level in relation to time makes the difference here.

Inventory Models with Two Delivery-Time Options

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we introduce lead-time choices for customers into the traditional
inventory model. Customers are grouped into two classes: one with a short lead-
time requirement and the other with a long lead-time requirement. The former asks
for a delivery lead time shorter than the lead time of the seller, and the latter asks
for a delivery lead time longer than the lead time of the seller. In addition to the
inventory replenishment decision, which is made in cycles, the seller makes the
inventory commitment decision, i.e., whether to use a unit of on-hand inventory
to satisfy a long lead-time customer immediately. We ﬁrst characterize the optimal
inventory commitment and replenishment policies in a non-capacitated setting. We
show that the optimal inventory commitment policy is subject to a commitment level
and that the optimal replenishment policy is of a base-stock type. We then consider
an extended model with a supply-capacity constraint, in which the commitment
policy further includes rejections of short and long lead-time orders. We show that
in the capacitated model, the optimal inventory commitment policy for short lead-
time customers is characterized by a switching commitment level and the optimal
inventory commitment policy for long lead-time customers is characterized by three
switching commitment levels. We then demonstrate the advantage of the optimal
dynamic policy by comparing its performance with that of a static rationing policy
through numerical studies.
The inventory commitment policy that allows the seller to satisfy long lead-time
customers from on-hand inventory represents the ﬂexibility in the two lead-time
options. This ﬂexibility is similar to that seen in the discussion of ﬂexible products
(Gallego and Phillips 2004; Chen et al. 2010). In both cases, ﬁrms provide multiple
options to customers, and different demand classes share some kind of commonality.
However, we focus on the role of lead-time differentiation and its implications for
inventory decisions in our models. The seller must make two decisions: the inventory
replenishment decision, which is made in batches, and the inventory commitment
decision, which is made upon the arrival of each customer.
Several limitations of the basic model investigated in this chapter are worth further
exploration. For example, we assume that the inventory commitment decision is
made on the spot upon the arrival of a customer. However, in some cases, it is also
reasonable for the seller to freely choose the time to deliver those backlogged long
lead-time orders, as long as it is before the promised delivery time. The prices of the
two options are also assumed given in the current model. It is of interest to investigate
the effect of the pricing decision on the inventory decisions and system performance.
We discuss these extensions in the following chapters.

Appendix
The appendix contains some of the proofs. Some proofs have been omitted to save
space and are available upon request from the authors.
Proof of Lemma 3.1
Proof It is straightforward to check that V (T, n−1, m)−V (T, n, m+1) = −c(m−
n + 1)+ −hn + h + s(n −1 −m)+ + c(n + 1 −n) + hn −s(n −m −1)+ = h,
which satisﬁes (a) and (b). Assume that V (t + 1, n −1, m) −V (t + 1, n, m + 1)
satisﬁes (a) and (b). We now prove that V (t, n −1, m)−V (t, n, m +1) also satisﬁes
(a) and (b).
Proof of (a). After checking (3.1), we know that we need only to check the
following inequality:
max{V (t + 1, n −2, m), V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1)}
−max{V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1), V (t + 1, n, m + 2)}
≤max{V (t + 1, n −1, m), V (t + 1, n, m + 1)}
−max{V (t + 1, n, m + 1), V (t + 1, n + 1, m + 2)}.
(3.5)
We check all possible cases in the remaining proof.

≤max{V (t + 1, n −1, m), V (t + 1, n, m + 1)} −V (t + 1, n, m + 1),
in which the second inequality holds because V (t +1, n−1, m)−V (t +1, n, m +1)
satisﬁes (a).
V (t + 1, n −2, m) −max{V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1), V (t + 1, n, m + 2)}

≤max{V (t + 1, n −1, m), V (t + 1, n, m + 1)} −V (t + 1, n + 1, m + 2),
in which the second and third inequalities hold because V (t + 1, n −1, m) −
V (t + 1, n, m + 1) satisﬁes (b) and (a), respectively.

satisﬁes (a).
From the preceding four inequalities, we know that (3.5) holds.
Proof of (b). After checking (3.1), we know that we need only to check the
following equality:
max{V (t + 1, n −2, m), V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1)}
−max{V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1), V (t + 1, n, m + 2)}
= max{V (t + 1, n −2, m + 1), V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2)}
−max{V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2), V (t + 1, n, m + 3)}.
(3.6)
We check all possible cases in the remaining proof.
When V (t +1, n −2, m) ≥V(t +1, n −1, m +1) and V (t +1, n −1, m +1) ≥
V (t +1, n, m +2), V (t +1, n−1, m)−V (t +1, n, m +1) satisﬁes (b), and we know
that V (t + 1, n −2, m + 1) ≥V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) and V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) ≥
V (t + 1, n, m + 3). Hence, (3.6) is equivalent to
V (t + 1, n −2, m) −V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1)
= V (t + 1, n −2, m + 1) −V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2),
which is true because V (t + 1, n −2, m) −V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1) satisﬁes (b).
When V (t +1, n −2, m) ≥V (t +1, n −1, m +1) and V (t +1, n −1, m +1) ≤
V (t +1, n, m +2), V (t +1, n−1, m)−V (t +1, n, m +1) satisﬁes (b), and we know
that V (t + 1, n −2, m + 1) ≥V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) and V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) ≤
V (t + 1, n, m + 3). Hence, (3.6) is equivalent to
V (t + 1, n −2, m) −V (t + 1, n, m + 2)
= V (t + 1, n −2, m + 1) −V (t + 1, n, m + 3).
As V (t + 1, n −2, m) −V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1) satisﬁes (b), we have V (t + 1,
n−2, m)−V (t +1, n, m +2) = V (t +1, n−2, m)−V (t +1, n−1, m +1)+V (t +
1, n−1, m+1)−V (t+1, n, m+2) = V (t+1, n−2, m+1)−V (t+1, n−1, m+2)+
V (t+1, n−1, m+2)−V (t+1, n, m+3) = V (t+1, n−2, m+1)−V (t+1, n, m+3).

Appendix
33
When V (t +1, n −2, m) ≤V (t +1, n −1, m +1) and V (t +1, n −1, m +1) ≥
V (t +1, n, m +2), V (t +1, n−1, m)−V (t +1, n, m +1) satisﬁes (b), and we know
that V (t + 1, n −2, m + 1) ≤V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) and V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) ≥
V (t + 1, n, m + 3). Hence, (3.6) is equivalent to
V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1) −V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1)
= V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) −V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2),
which is obviously true.
When V (t +1, n −2, m) ≤V (t +1, n −1, m +1) and V (t +1, n −1, m +1) ≤
V (t +1, n, m +2), V (t +1, n−1, m)−V (t +1, n, m +1) satisﬁes (b), and we know
that V (t + 1, n −2, m + 1) ≤V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) and V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) ≤
V (t + 1, n, m + 3). Hence, (3.6) is equivalent to
V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1) −V (t + 1, n, m + 2)
= V (t + 1, n −1, m + 2) −V (t + 1, n, m + 3),
which is true because V (t + 1, n −1, m + 1) −V (t + 1, n, m + 2) satisﬁes (b).
From the preceding four equalities, we know that (3.6) holds.

Proof of Theorem 3.1
Proof According to (3.1), it is optimal to deliver now if V (t + 1, n −1, m) −V (t +
1, n, m + 1) ≥0 and to deliver in the next cycle otherwise. Lemma 3.1 provides
that in a speciﬁc period t, the value of V (t + 1, n −1, m) −V (t + 1, n, m + 1)
is non-decreasing in n and independent of m. Hence, if V (t + 1, 0, m) −V (t +
1, 1, m + 1) ≥0, V (t + 1, n −1, m) −V (t + 1, n, m + 1) ≥0 for all n ≥1. In
this case, CL(t) = 0, and the optimal policy is to deliver orders to long lead-time
customers now for all n ≥1. Otherwise, CL(t) equals the largest value of n such
that V (t + 1, n −1, m) −V (t + 1, n, m + 1) ≤0. CL(t) is obviously independent
of m.
The following is the proof of the non-increasing property of CL(t) in relation to t.
According to the deﬁnition of CL(t), we know that
V (t + 1, CL(t) −1, m) ≤V (t + 1, CL(t), m + 1),
V (t + 1, CL(t) −2, m) ≤V (t + 1, CL(t) −1, m + 1).
(3.7)
From (3.1), we know that

+ πs[V (t + 1, CL(t) −2, m) −V (t + 1, CL(t) −1, m + 1)].
From (3.7)andLemma3.1,wehave V (t+1, CL(t)−1, m)−V (t+1, CL(t), m+1) =
V (t + 1, CL(t) −1, m + 1) −V (t + 1, CL(t), m + 2) ≤0 and V (t + 1, CL(t) −
2, m) −V (t + 1, CL(t) −1, m + 1) ≤0. Hence, we know that
V (t, CL(t) −1, m) −V (t, CL(t), m) ≤0.
AsCL(t−1)isdeﬁnedasthelargestvaluen suchthat V (t, n−1, m)−V (t, n, m) ≤0,
we know that CL(t −1) ≥CL(t).
Also, according to the deﬁnition of CL(t), we have
V (t + 1, CL(t) + 1, m) > V (t + 1, CL(t) + 2, m + 1),
V (t + 1, CL(t), m) > V (t + 1, CL(t) + 1, m + 1).
(3.8)
From (3.7), we know that
V (t, CL(t) + 1, m) −V (t, CL(t) + 2, m + 1)
= π0[V (t + 1, CL(t) + 1, m) −V (t + 1, CL(t) + 2, m + 1)]
+ π f [V (t + 1, CL(t), m) −V (t + 1, CL(t) + 1, m + 1)]
+ πs[V (t + 1, CL(t), m) −V (t + 1, CL(t) + 1, m + 1)].
From (3.8), we know that
V (t, CL(t) + 1, m) −V (t, CL(t) + 2, m) > 0.
AsCL(t−1)isdeﬁnedasthelargestvaluen suchthat V (t, n−1, m)−V (t, n, m) ≤0,
we know that CL(t) + 2 > CL(t −1), i.e., CL(t) + 1 ≥CL(t −1).

Proof of Lemma 3.3

1, n, m) satisﬁes the properties in the lemma and prove that V Q(t, n, m) preserves
these properties. From (3.3), we know that we need only to focus on the term
max{V Q(t + 1, n −1, m), V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1), V Q(t + 1, n, m)}. In what follows,
we prove that max{V Q(t + 1, n −1, m), V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1), V Q(t + 1, n, m)}
satisﬁes the properties in this lemma step by step.
We prove that

First, we have V Q(t +1, n−2, m)−max{V Q(t +1, n−1, m +1), V Q(t +1, n, m +

holds because V Q(t + 1, n, m) satisﬁes property (a) of the lemma. Second, we
have V Q(t + 1, n −2, m) −max{V Q(t + 1, n −1, m + 1), V Q(t + 1, n, m +

in which the third inequality holds because V Q(t + 1, n, m) satisﬁes properties (a)

we have V Q(t +1, n −1, m +1)−max{V Q(t +1, n −1, m +1), V Q(t +1, n, m +

inequality holds because V Q(t + 1, n, m) satisﬁes property (b) of the lemma. Thus
we prove that (3.10) holds.
We also prove that

1, m), V Q(t +1, n, m +1), V Q(t +1, n, m)}−V Q(t +1, n+1, m +2), in which the
second and third inequalities hold because V Q(t + 1, n, m) satisﬁes property (a) of
the lemma. Third, we have V Q(t+1, n−1, m)−max{V Q(t+1, n−1, m+1), V Q(t+
1, n, m + 2), V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1)} ≤V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) ≤
V Q(t + 1, n, m) −V Q(t + 1, n + 1, m + 1) ≤max{V Q(t + 1, n −1, m), V Q(t +

inequality holds because V Q(t + 1, n, m) satisﬁes property (a) of the lemma. Thus,
we prove that (3.11) holds.
By combining (3.9), (3.10), and (3.11), we know that

(3.12)
By applying the same technique, we can prove that
max{V Q(t + 1, n −2, m), V Q(t + 1, n −1, m + 1), V Q(t + 1, n −1, m)}
−max{V Q(t + 1, n −1, m + 1), V Q(t + 1, n, m + 2), V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1)}
≤max{V Q(t + 1, n −2, m + 1), V Q(t + 1, n −1, m + 2), V Q(t + 1, n −1, m + 1)}

−max{V Q(t + 1, n −1, m + 1), V Q(t + 1, n, m + 2), V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1)}
(3.14)
Hence, from (3.12), (3.13), and (3.14), we know that
V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m + 1) ≤V (t, n, m) −V (t, n + 1, m + 1),
(3.15)
V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m + 1) ≤V (t, n −1, m + 1) −V (t, n, m + 2), (3.16)
V (t, n −1, m + 1) −V (t, n, m + 1) ≤V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m).
(3.17)
From (3.17), we know that
V (t, n −1, m + 1) −V (t, n −1, m) ≤V (t, n, m + 1) −V (t, n, m).
(3.18)
Furthermore, V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m) = V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m + 1) +
V (t, n, m + 1) −V (t, n, m) ≤V (t, n, m) −V (t, n + 1, m + 1) + V (t, n + 1, m +
1) −V (t, n + 1, m), in which the inequality holds because of (3.15) and (3.18).
Hence,
V (t, n −1, m) −V (t, n, m) ≤V (t, n, m) −V (t, n + 1, m).
(3.19)
In addition, V (t, n, m + 1) −V (t, n, m) = V (t, n, m + 1) −V (t, n + 1, m +
1) + V (t, n + 1, m + 1) −V (t, n, m) ≥V (t, n, m + 2) −V (t, n + 1, m + 2) +
V (t, n +1, m +2)−V (t, n, m +1), in which the inequality holds because of (3.19)
and (3.16). Hence,
V (t, n, m + 1) −V (t, n, m) ≥V (t, n, m + 2) −V (t, n, m + 1).

Inventory Models with Two Delivery-Time Options
Proof of Theorem 3.3
Proof From(a)inLemma3.3,weknowthat V Q(t+1, n−1, m)−V Q(t+1, n, m+1)
is non-decreasing in both m and n. By deﬁnition, CL1(t, m) is, if not 0, the largest
value of n such that V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) ≤0. Hence, we
know that CL1(t, m) is non-increasing in m. From (b) and (c) in Lemma 3.3, we can
derive that both CL2(t, m) and CL3(t, m) are non-decreasing in m.
From Deﬁnition 3.1, we know that for n(t) > max{CL1(t, m), CL3(t, m)}, V Q(t+
1, n −1, m) > max{V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1), V Q(t + 1, n, m) −p f }, and to deliver
orders to long lead-time customers immediately is optimal. In this case, V Q(t +
1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m) + p f > 0, which means n(t) > CL2(t, m). Hence,
CL2(t, m) ≤max{CL1(t, m), CL3(t, m)}.
For n(t) ≤min{CL1(t, m), CL3(t, m)}, V Q(t + 1, n, m) −p f ≥max{V Q(t +
1, n, m + 1), V Q(t + 1, n −1, m)}, and it is optimal to reject orders from long lead-
time customers. In this case, V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t + 1, n, m) + p f ≤0,
which means n(t) ≤CL2(t, m). Hence, CL2(t, m) ≥min{CL1(t, m), CL3(t, m)}.
When CL1(t, m) > CL3(t, m), for CL3(t, m) < n ≤CL1(t, m), V Q(t + 1, n −
1, m) < V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) and V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) > V Q(t + 1, n, m) −ps. It
is optimal to deliver products to long lead-time customers in the next period.
When CL1(t, m) < CL3(t, m), CL1(t, m) ≤CL2(t, m) ≤CL3(t, m). For
CL1(t, m) < n ≤CL2(t, m), V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) > V Q(t + 1, n, m + 1) and
V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) < V Q(t + 1, n, m) −ps. It is optimal to reject orders from
long lead-time customers. For CL2(t, m) < n ≤CL3(t, m), V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) >
V Q(t +1, n, m)−p f and V Q(t +1, n, m +1) < V Q(t +1, n, m)−p f . It is optimal
to deliver orders to long lead-time customers immediately.
□
Proof of Theorem 3.4
Proof It is easy to prove (a), (b), and (c) by adopting the same technique used in
the proof of Lemma 3.3. We prove (d).
When Q increases, from (a), we know that V Q(t+1, n−1, m)−V Q(t+1, n, m+
1) remains the same or becomes smaller. Recall that V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t +
1, n, m+1) is non-decreasing in n based on Lemma 3.3. Hence, the commitment level
CL1(t, m), the biggest value of n such that V Q(t+1, n−1, m)−V Q(t+1, n, m+1) ≤
0, remains unchanged or increases.
When Q increases, from (b), we know that V Q(t+1, n−1, m)−V Q(t+1, n, m+
1) remains the same or becomes greater. Recall that V Q(t + 1, n −1, m) −V Q(t +
1, n, m + 1) is non-decreasing in n based on Lemma 3.3. Hence, the commitment
level CL2(t, m), the biggest value of n such that V Q(t +1, n −1, m)+ p f −V Q(t +
1, n, m) ≤0, remains unchanged or decreases.

Chapter 4
Inventory Models with Delivery-Time
Upgrade
Abstract In this chapter, we extend the unitary inventory commitment policy dis-
cussed in Chap.3 to a more general upgrade policy, which allows the seller to choose
the delivery time of all backlogged long lead-time orders. We characterize the optimal
inventory upgrade and replenishment policies. In our analysis, we resort to the tech-
nique of anti-multimodularity to derive the structural properties of the value function.
We further calibrate the model parameters using the empirical data collected from
Toyota China dealerships and calculate the optimal policies and several performance
metrics accordingly. The numerical results show that the upgrade mechanism can
improve both proﬁt and inventory usage.
4.1
Introduction
In Chap.3, we introduce our formulation of inventory models with alternative deliv-
ery lead times. Between inventory replenishments, the seller makes use of inventory
commitment control to handle incoming orders from both short and long lead-time
customers. It is assumed that the inventory commitment decision is made on the spot.
In this chapter, we consider a generalization of this commitment decision. Although
the rejection decisions (applicable in the capacitated setting) are still made on the
spot, the early delivery of a backlogged long lead-time order, i.e., the delivery-time
upgrade, can be carried out at any time before the promised delivery time.
The upgrade mechanism is consistent with the business practice at Toyota China
dealerships, which we introduce in detail in Chap.2. As previously mentioned, the
forecast by Toyota China is plagued by the problem of high volatility in the Chinese
automobile market. For instance, Highlander, a popular SUV produced by Toyota,
began local production in China in early 2009. Compared with Toyota’s projected
demand in the ﬁrst half of 2009, the order quantity placed by dealerships was 60%
higher and the actual realized demand was 90% higher. Toyota China responded
to the supply shortage by beginning to expand its production in September 2009,
which was already very late. Hence, a speciﬁc strategy characterized by differentiated
prices and delivery times is typically used at dealerships (known as 4S stores: sales,
service, spare parts, and surveys) to handle the supply-demand imbalance. In general,

Inventory Models with Delivery-Time Upgrade
when demand exceeds supply, dealerships begin to sell cars in two forms: spot and
consignment. Customers who choose the spot option get their desired cars from the
stock at a higher price, and customers who choose the consignment option pay the
list price and join the waiting list. The orders of consignment customers usually take
two to three months to clear. To implement this strategy, dealerships must decide
whether to fulﬁll or delay an incoming order, in addition to the backlogged long
lead-time orders, with updated information about inventory and demand. The aim
of our theoretical analysis of the upgrade mechanism is to develop models, derive
management strategies, and reveal insights into this market-segmentation strategy.
The model formulation and analysis follow those of the basic model in Chap.3,
with a few notable differences. First, the upgrade decision generalizes the unitary
inventory control in the basic model. It allows the seller to determine the delivery of
not only the incoming order in the current period but also previously backlogged long
lead-time orders. Second, to facilitate our analysis, we make a variable substitution to
replace the outstanding long lead-time orders by the net inventory, which equals the
on-hand inventory level minus the number of promised-for-delivery orders. Third,
we resort to the technique of anti-multimodularity to derive the structural properties
of the value function and obtain the optimal policies in the capacitated setting. In
addition to the preceding changes in our theoretical analysis, we calibrate the model
parameters using the empirical data collected from Toyota China dealerships and
calculate the optimal policies and several performance metrics accordingly. The
results show the improvements in both proﬁt and inventory usage with the adoption
of the upgrade mechanism.
In the remainder of this chapter, Sect.4.2 presents the formulation of the problem.
In Sect.4.3, we obtain the optimal inventory allocation, upgrade, and replenishment
policies and discuss their properties, ﬁrst in a non-capacitated setting and then in
a capacitated setting. In Sect.4.4, we conduct numerical studies to calculate the
optimal policies and demonstrate the performance of the upgrade mechanism using
parameters calibrated from empirical data. Section4.5 concludes the chapter.
4.2
Model Formulation
The model setup and notation mostly follow those of the basic model in Chap.3.
We still consider a single-product, ﬁnite-time-horizon, periodic-review inventory
system. Inventory is replenished at the beginning of each review cycle, and unused
inventory is carried over to the next cycle. A cycle is further divided into T periods,
and a period is short enough such that at most one customer arrives in each period.
The seller provides two delivery-time options to its customers: immediate delivery
(short) or delivery at the beginning of the next cycle (long). Accordingly, there are two
classes of customers: short and long lead-time customers. Their arrival probabilities
in a period remain the same as in the basic model.
A short lead-time customer requires an immediate delivery. The order is lost if
the seller runs out of on-hand inventory. For a long lead-time customer, the seller can

4.2 Model Formulation
43
either fulﬁll his/her order at the next replenishment as promised or fulﬁll it earlier,
including immediate delivery on the spot. In each period, the seller also reviews
previously backlogged long lead-time orders and determines whether to delivery
them in the current period. We denote the action of fulﬁlling demand from long
lead-time customers with on-hand inventory as an upgrade. We assume that long
lead-time customers prefer an early delivery and thus always accept the upgrade.
The cost parameters remain the same as in the basic model. However, the holding
cost is now calculated at the end of each period rather than at the end of the cycle.
In the basic model, the inventory commitment decision can determine only the early
delivery of a long lead-time order upon its arrival. The calculation of the holding
cost thus can be postponed to the end of the cycle. The upgrade decision, in contrast,
can choose a more ﬂexible delivery time. It is therefore necessary to calculate the
holding cost in each period. Otherwise, the seller can choose to delay all deliveries
until the last period in a cycle.
In period t, the seller chooses an upgrade quantity, denoted by u(t). The upgrade
quantity u(t) is constrained by the on-hand inventory level n(t) and outstanding long
orders m(t). We denote the feasible range of u(t) for given n(t) and m(t) as U (n, m).
Let Z+ be the set of non-negative integers. We have
U (n, m) = {u : 0 ≤u ≤n ∧m, u ∈Z+},
where n ∧m = min{n, m}. In each period, there are three possibilities in relation
to customer arrival: a short lead-time customer, a long lead-time customer, or no
customer. We denote the upgrade quantities in the three scenarios as us, u f , and u0,
respectively. We now charaterize the inventory dynamics. When n(t) > 0,
(n(t + 1), m(t + 1))
=
⎧
⎨
⎩
(n(t) −1 −us, m(t) −us), if a short lead-time customer arrives;
(n(t) −u f , m(t) + 1 −u f ), if a long lead-time customer arrives;
(n(t) −u0, m(t) −u0),
no customer arrives.
When n(t) = 0,
(n(t + 1), m(t + 1)) =
(0, m(t) + 1), if a long lead-time customer arrives;
(0, m(t)),
if a short lead-time or no customer arrives.
We start with a single-cycle model without a supply-capacity constraint. As there
is no capacity constraint, the seller satisﬁes all short lead-time orders and accepts
all long lead-time orders. Let V (t, n, m) be the value function in period t. For 1 ≤
t < T , if n(t) = 0, the short lead-time order is lost, and the long lead-time order is
backlogged for future delivery. Hence, the dynamic programming recursion can be
written as follows:
V (t, 0, m) = (π0 + πs)V (t + 1, 0, m) + π f [p f + V (t + 1, 0, m + 1)].

Inventory Models with Delivery-Time Upgrade
If n(t) ≥1, the seller can choose whether to upgrade outstanding long lead-time
orders and how many to upgrade. We have
V (t, n, m) = π0
max
u0∈U (n,m) V (t + 1, n −u0, m −u0)
+ π f [
max
u f ∈U (n,m+1) V (t + 1, n −u f , m + 1 −u f ) + p f ]
+ πs[
max
us∈U (n−1,m) V (t + 1, n −1 −us, m −us) + ps] −hn,
and
V (T, n, m) = −c(m −n)+ + s(n −m)+.
A close look at the preceding dynamic programming equations reveals that the ter-
minal function and upgrade decision are more involved with the difference between
the on-hand inventory level and outstanding long lead-time orders, i.e., n(t) −m(t).
Further analysis indicates that it is mathematically convenient to use this difference
variable rather than m(t). We call the difference variable the net inventory and denote
it as mn(t). The feasible range of u(t) and the dynamic programming equations can
be updated as follows:
U (n(t), mn(t)) = {u : 0 ≤u ≤n(t) ∧(n(t) −mn(t)), u ∈Z+},
V (t, n, mn) = π0
max
u0∈U (n,mn) V (t + 1, n −u0, mn)
+ π f
max
u f ∈U (n,mn−1) V (t + 1, n −u f , mn −1)
+ πs
max
us∈U (n−1,mn−1) V (t + 1, n −1 −us, mn −1)
+ π f p f + πs ps −hn,
V (t, 0, mn) = (π0 + πs)V (t + 1, 0, mn)
+ π f [p f + V (t + 1, 0, mn −1)],
and
V (T, n, mn) = −cm−
n + sm+
n .
The upgrade decision reduces on-hand inventory and outstanding long lead-time
orders at the same time and thus does not change the value of the net inventory. Note
that the net inventory can be either positive or negative. A negative net inventory
means that the on-hand inventory is insufﬁcient to satisfy all backlogged long lead-
time orders.

4.3 Optimal Inventory Upgrade and Replenishment Policies

4.3
Optimal Inventory Upgrade and Replenishment
Policies
In this section, we ﬁrst characterize the seller’s optimal inventory upgrade and replen-
ishment policies without a supply-capacity constraint. We then derive the optimal
policies in the presence of a supply-capacity constraint.
4.3.1
Optimal Inventory Upgrade Policy
To derive the optimal upgrade policy, we ﬁrst introduce the following preliminary
results. Proofs are relegated to the appendix.
Lemma 4.1 (a) For a given mn, V (t, n −1, mn) −V (t, n, mn) is non-decreasing
in n, i.e., V (t, n −1, mn) −V (t, n, mn) ≤V (t, n, mn) −V (t, n + 1, mn).
(b) V (t, n −1, mn) −V (t, n, mn) is independent of mn, i.e., V (t, n −1, mn) −
V (t, n, mn) = V (t, n −1, mn + 1) −V (t, n, mn + 1).
Part (a) of Lemma 4.1 indicates that given a net inventory level, the marginal proﬁt
of on-hand inventory, V (t, n, mn) −V (t, n −1, mn), is non-increasing as on-hand
inventory increases. Part (b) further shows that the marginal proﬁt of on-hand inven-
tory is independent of the net inventory level. With the properties in Lemma 4.1, we
characterize the optimal upgrade policy in the following theorem.
Theorem 4.1 (a) In period t, the optimal inventory upgrade policy is characterized
by a threshold level CL(t). It equals 0 if V (t, 0, mn) −V (t, 1, mn) > 0 and equals
mn(t) if V (t, m, m) −V (t, m + 1, m) > 0. Otherwise, CL(t) is deﬁned as the max-
imum value of n(t) such that V (t, n −1, mn) −V (t, n, mn) ≤0. Moreover, CL(t)
is independent of the net inventory mn(t) in the last case.
(b) In period t, for a given mn(t), if n(t) > CL(t), upgrade down to CL(t). If n(t) <
CL(t), make no upgrade.
Lemma 4.1 and Theorem 4.1 respectively resemble Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 3.1 in
Chap.3, which are obtained in the case of unitary inventory commitment control. The
inventory upgrade policy now gives greater ﬂexibility to the seller, and the optimal
upgrade policy that we describe in Theorem 4.1 can be viewed as a reverse base-
stock policy. That is, rather than order up to, the seller chooses to upgrade its on-hand
inventory level down to the optimal threshold. We look at the three upgrade quantities:
u0, us, and u f . In period t, the following relations hold: if u0 > 0, u0 = u f = us + 1,
and if u0 = 0, u0 = u f = us = 0. These simple relations come directly from the
properties in Lemma 4.1.

Inventory Models with Delivery-Time Upgrade
4.3.2
Optimal Inventory Replenishment Policy
We now investigate the optimal inventory replenishment policy at the beginning of
the cycle. In addition to the properties in Lemma 4.1, we can obtain the following
structural property.
Lemma 4.2 V (t, n, mn) is integer concave in mn(t).
At the beginning of the cycle, we assume that the seller starts with an initial inventory
n(0). The inventory replenishment decision can be written as follows.
max
n(1)≥n(0){V (1, n(1), n(1)) −c[n(1) −n(0)]}
= cn(0) +
max
n(1)≥n(0){V (1, n(1), n(1)) −cn(1)}.
As there is no outstanding long lead-time order at the beginning of the cycle, the
net inventory equals the on-hand inventory, i.e., mn(1) = n(1). V (1, n(1), n(1)) is
concave in n(1) given the integer concavities and modularity in n and mn. This makes
it possible to characterize the optimal inventory replenishment policy.
Theorem 4.2 Theinventoryreplenishmentpolicyisofabase-stocktype.Thereexists
an optimal order-up-to level n∗(1) such that the optimal ordering quantity is
q∗=
n∗(1) −n(0), if n(0) ≤n∗(1),
0,
if n(0) > n∗(1),
where n∗(1) is the maximizer of V (1, n(1), n(1)) −c[n(1) −n(0)].
4.3.3
Multi-cycle Problem
Based on the results derived in the single-cycle problem, we are ready to extend
our discussion to the general multi-cycle problem. In the multi-cycle problem, the
seller replenishes its inventory at the beginning of each cycle. This replenishment
serves two purposes: to clear the remaining outstanding long lead-time orders from
previous cycle and to hold stock for the demand in the upcoming cycle.
The derivation of the optimal policies still depends on the following three key
properties.
Integer concavity in n:
V (t, n, mn) −V (t, n −1, mn) ≥V (t, n + 1, mn) −V
(t, n, mn);
Integer concavity in mn:
V (t, n, mn) −V (t, n, mn −1) ≥V (t, n, mn + 1) −V
(t, n, mn);
Modularity in n and mn:
V (t, n, mn) −V (t, n −1, mn) = V (t, n, mn −1) −V
(t, n −1, mn −1).

4.3 Optimal Inventory Upgrade and Replenishment Policies
47
In preceding analysis, we prove that these three properties hold within a single cycle.
For the multi-cycle problem, we further prove that the inventory replenishment at
the beginning of each cycle preserves these properties.
Lemma 4.3 The optimal inventory replenishment policy at the beginning of each
cycle preserves the following properties: the integer concavities and modularity in
n and mn.
Given that the three properties hold for all V (t, n, mn), the results derived in the
single-cycle problem still apply.
Theorem 4.3 For the multi-cycle problem, the optimal upgrade policy is of a thresh-
old type, as described in Theorem 4.1, and the optimal inventory replenishment
policy at the beginning of each cycle follows a base-stock policy, as described in
Theorem 4.2.
Recall that in Theorem 3.1 in Chap.3, we prove that the commitment level
decreases over time and the decrement is at most one unit per period. We next
show that this property remains true in the upgrade model, as stated in the following
theorem.
Theorem 4.4 When h is time-invariant, denote the optimal thresholds for two con-
secutive periods t and t + 1 within a cycle as CL(t) and CL(t + 1), respectively. We
have
0 ≤CL(t) −CL(t + 1) ≤1.
Note that in the preceding discussion and dynamic programming equations, we sim-
ply use h to represent the holding cost. It is obvious that h could be time-dependent,
i.e., as a function of time, h(t), and all preceding results still hold. However, to derive
the result in Theorem 4.4, the assumption that h is time invariant is necessary. When
this assumption is violated, the simple structure of the threshold may not hold. That
is, the threshold CL(t) may increase rather than decrease over time, and the change
per period can be greater than one unit.
With the property of CL(t) established in Theorem 4.4, the dynamic programming
equation can be simpliﬁed. For a seller, starting with zero outstanding long lead-
time order, the optimal action in any period is to choose whether to upgrade one
outstanding long lead-time order if a long lead-time customer or no customer arrives
in that period. Otherwise, no action needs to be taken.
4.3.4
Optimal Policies with a Supply-Capacity Constraint
In this subsection, we incorporate a supply-capacity constraint into the upgrade
model. We assume that there is a capacity constraint for the replenishment at the
beginning of each cycle, denoted by Q. The supply capacity is not imposed as a hard
constraint. When a replenishment exceeds the capacity, a penalty cost, denoted as cp,

Inventory Models with Delivery-Time Upgrade
is incurred for each extra unit. As a result, to avoid the penalty, the seller can choose
to reject short and long lead-time orders. It is clear that when cp = 0, the problem is
reduced to the non-capacitated case.
Recall that we deﬁne the upgrade quantities in three possible demand-arrival
scenarios as us, u f , and u0, respectively in the non-capacitated model. Due to the
incorporation of rejection decisions, us, u f , and u0 are now better understood as
the upgrade quantities that respectively correspond to three possible system states.
The three states are generated by the customer arrival and the seller’s subsequent
acceptance/rejectiondecision.Weexplainthemindetailhere.Assumethatthesystem
state is (n, mn) at the beginning of period t. If no customer arrives, the seller chooses
an upgrade quantity u0, and the state changes to (n −u0, mn). If a short lead-time
customer arrives, the seller ﬁrst decides whether to accept or reject the order. If the
order is accepted, the seller chooses an upgrade quantity us, and the state changes to
(n −1 −us, mn −1); if the order is rejected, the seller chooses an upgrade quantity
u0, and the state changes to (n −u0, mn). If a long lead-time customer arrives, the
seller decides whether to accept or reject the order. If the order is accepted, the seller
chooses an upgrade quantity u f , and the state changes to (n −u f , mn −1); if the
order is rejected, the seller chooses an upgrade quantity u0, and the state changes to
(n −u0, mn).Tofurthersimplifythenotation,weuseus torepresentu f bynotingthat
in the long-lead-time-demand scenario, u f = 0 if the seller chooses not to upgrade
and u f = us + 1 if the seller upgrades.
We still start with a single-cycle problem. Let V Q(t, n, mn) be the value function
in period t. The dynamic programming equations can be rewritten as follows:
V Q(t, n, mn) = π0

To understand the structural properties of the value function, we introduce the fol-
lowing deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.1 (Altman et al. 2003; Hajek 1985) Let ei ∈Nk (i = 1, · · · , k) denote
the vector with all entries equal to 0 except for a 1 in its ith entry. Deﬁne si =
ei−1 −ei, i = 2, · · · , k. Let F = {−e1, s2, s3, . . . , sk−1, sk, ek}. Then, a real-valued
function f : Zk →R is multimodular in relation to F if for all x ∈Zk, v and w in
F, v ̸= w, and the following holds: f (x + v) + f (x + w) ≥f (x) + f (x + v + w).

4.3 Optimal Inventory Upgrade and Replenishment Policies

Multimodularity is one way to deﬁne joint convexity for multiple discrete variables.
Interested readers may refer to Altman et al. (2003) for a thorough treatment of this
topic. For our problem, we need the following property of anti-multimodularity.
Deﬁnition 4.2 (Narongwanich et al. 2002) A real-valued function f : Zk →R is
said to be anti-multimodular if −f is multimodular.
For brevity, in what follows we refer to anti-multimodularity/anti-multimodular as
AMM. We can prove the following lemma.
Lemma 4.4 V Q(t, n, mn) is AMM on (−n, mn).
We provide a sketch of the proof here. For an AMM function, we can construct a con-
tinuously concave counterpart through linear interpolation (Altman et al. 2003). To
prove the AMM is preserved by the dynamic programming recursion, we ﬁrst trans-
form the value function into its continuous counterpart and prove the preservation of
joint concavity of the new continuous function. We then prove that the transforma-
tion is reversible. One advantage of such a proof procedure is that it proves all of the
discrete properties together rather than one by one by using the discrete-continuous-
discrete transformation.
We are now ready to characterize the seller’s optimal inventory control pol-
icy based on the preceding structural properties. In each period, depending on the
customer arrival, the seller makes two sequential decisions: whether to accept or
reject the incoming short (long) lead-time order, if any, and then to choose an
upgrade quantity for the outstanding long lead-time orders. In period t, the upgrade
decision depends on the value of V Q(t + 1, n, mn) −V Q(t + 1, n −1, mn). As
long as this value is positive, the seller should keep upgrading. Deﬁne CL(t, mn)
as CL(t, mn) = arg max
n {V Q(t + 1, n, mn) −V Q(t + 1, n −1, mn) ≥0}. If such an
n(t) does not exist, CL(t, mn) = max{mn(t), 0}. Following the AMM, we know that
CL(t, mn) is non-decreasing in mn(t) and CL(t, mn + 1) −CL(t, mn) ≤1. On the
right side of CL(t, mn) (i.e., n(t) > CL(t, mn)), it is optimal for the seller to upgrade
down to CL(t, mn). On the left side of CL(t, mn) (i.e., n(t) < CL(t, mn)), the seller
makes no upgrade.
Asimilarlogicappliestothehandlingofanincomingshortorlonglead-timeorder.
For a short lead-time order, the seller’s action depends on the value of V Q(t, n, mn) −
V Q(t, n −1, mn −1) −ps. The seller should fulﬁll the order as long as this value is
negative and reject it otherwise. On the left side of CL(t, mn), we deﬁne CS(t, mn)
asCS(t, mn) = arg max
n {V Q(t, n, mn) −V Q(t, n −1, mn −1) ≥ps}. According to
the AMM, CS(t, mn) is non-increasing in mn(t). On the right side of CL(t, mn),
because of the subsequent upgrade decision, CS(t, mn) becomes a line parallel to the
n-axis, which implies that it does not change with n(t). Its value is deﬁned as CS(t) =
arg max
mn {V Q(t, CL, mn) −V Q(t, CL, mn −1) ≥ps}, where CL(t, mn) is as deﬁned
previously. The handling of an incoming long lead-time order depends on the value
of V Q(t, n, mn) −V Q(t, n, mn −1) −p f . If this value is negative, the seller should

as CR(t, mn) = arg max

50

Inventory Models with Delivery-Time Upgrade
AMM, CR(t, mn) is non-decreasing in mn(t). On the right side of CL(t, mn),
because of the subsequent upgrade decision, CR(t, mn) becomes a line parallel to
the n-axis, with a value deﬁned as CR(t) = arg max
mn {V Q(t, CL, mn) −V Q(t, CL,
mn −1) ≥p f }.
The three switching curves, CL(t, mn), CS(t), and CR(t) as deﬁned previously,
jointly determine the seller’s optimal inventory control policies for short and long
lead-time orders, as illustrated in Fig.4.1(a) and (b), respectively.
Theorem 4.5 In period t, the seller’s optimal inventory control policy depends on
the customer arrival.
(i) No customer:
If n(t) > CL(t, mn), the seller should upgrade outstanding long
lead-time orders until the on-hand inventory level reaches CL(t, mn).
(ii) A short customer:
The optimal policy is characterized by two switching curves,
CL(t, mn) and CS(t), as depicted in Fig.4.1(a). In Region AU (RU), the seller
accepts (rejects) the short lead-time order and then upgrades the outstanding
long lead-time orders until the switching curve CL(t, mn) is reached. In Region
A (R), the seller simply accepts (rejects) the short lead-time order, without any
subsequent upgrade. Regions AU (A) and RU (R) are separated by the switching
curve CS(t).
(iii) A long customer:
The optimal policy is characterized by two switching curves,
CL(t, mn) and CR(t), as depicted in Fig.4.1(b). In Region AU (RU), the seller
accepts (rejects) the long lead-time order and then upgrades the outstanding long
lead-time orders until the switching curve CL(t, mn) is reached. In Region A (R),
the seller simply accepts (rejects) the long lead-time order, without any subsequent
upgrade. Regions AU (A) and RU (R) are separated by the switching curve CR(t).
Previous work has shown that the optimal inventory replenishment policy for
inventory systems with a capacity constraint mostly follows a modiﬁed base-stock
type (Evans 1967; Federgruen and Zipkin 1986; Decroix and Arreola-Risa 1998).
That is, the inventory manager tries to restore its inventory to the base-stock level,
only now the order quantity is constrained by the capacity. In the following analysis,
we show that the optimal replenishment policy in our model is of a similar type.
Consider the replenishment decision at the beginning of the cycle discussed above.
At the beginning of the cycle, we assume that the seller starts with an initial inventory
n(0). The seller then replenishes the inventory, if necessary, up to a desired level n(1),
subject to n(1) ≥n(0). (Note that the capacity constraint in our model is imposed
as a soft constraint.)

where c[n(1) −n(0)] represents the total procurement cost and cp[n(1) −n(0) −
Q]+ represents the extra penalty cost if the capacity is exceeded. According to the
preceding analysis, we know that V Q(1, n(1), n(1)) satisﬁes the AMM.

Inventory Models with Delivery-Time Upgrade
The seller’s optimal inventory replenishment policy is:
(i) if n(0) ≥n∗(1), do not order;
(ii) if n∗(1) −Q ≤n(0) < n∗(1), order up to n∗(1); and
(iii) if n(0) < n∗(1) −Q, order up to n∗∗(1) ∨(n(0) + Q).
To extend the foregoing results to the general multi-cycle case, it sufﬁces to
prove that the AMM is preserved by inventory replenishments between cycles. The
sequence of events between cycles is as follows. The seller ﬁrst clears all of the out-
standing long lead-time orders and procures to cover the shortage, if any. The seller
then replenishes its inventory, if necessary, to the optimal level. Suppose the inven-
tory is replenished in period t, and denote the time immediately before and after the
replenishment as t−and t+. We have
V Q(t−, n, mn) = max
n∗∈Z+{V Q(t+, n∗∨mn, n∗∨mn) −c(n∗∨mn −mn) −cp(n∗∨mn −mn −Q)+}.
We prove the following result.
Lemma 4.5 The optimal inventory replenishment between cycles preserves the
AMM.
Given that the AMM holds for all V Q(t, n, mn), we can generalize the preceding
results derived for the single-cycle problem to the multi-cycle case.
Theorem 4.7 For the multi-cycle problem, the optimal inventory control policy is
the same as described in Theorem 4.5, and the optimal inventory replenishment policy
at the beginning of each cycle is of a base-stock type, as described in Theorem 4.6.

Demand and Inventory Management at Toyota China
Dealerships
According to the results of our ﬁeld study, Toyota China dealerships adopt a strategy
resembling the short/long lead-time customer segmentation strategy. In this section,
we carry out numerical studies using parameters calibrated from the empirical data
obtained from Toyota dealerships. The results show that the inventory upgrade mech-
anism can effectively reduce inventory risk and achieve better inventory usage.
We adopt the non-capacitated model in the numerical studies. Recall that in the
non-capacitated setting, the optimal inventory upgrade policy in a period is character-
ized by a threshold level that is independent of the net inventory. The seller upgrades
down to the threshold level if the on-hand inventory level is above the threshold and
makes no upgrade otherwise. The length of a cycle is set to one month (thirty days),
and we assume that there are forty-eight periods per day.
The model parameters can be put into two categories: revenue-structure parame-
ters, including ps, p f , c, h, and s (we assume there is no backorder cost), and arrival
rates, including πs and π f . The revenue-structure parameters are retrieved directly

parameter values are summarized in Table4.1. Their derivation is detailed in the
appendix.
For convenience, we assume that upgrades are made daily, i.e., every 48 periods,
rather than in each period. Note that this is equivalent to considering the case of batch-
demand arrival in a period. The optimal upgrade policy for the non-capacitated model
remains of a threshold type. The optimal upgrade threshold and expected proﬁt for
given initial inventory levels are presented in Fig.4.2. The theoretical optimal initial
inventory is 194 for the upgrade model. However, the average monthly inventory level
from Toyota’s empirical data is roughly 360. This results in a 20% proﬁt difference.

simulation.) The overstock may be attributed to factors that are not considered in
the theoretical model. For example, there are multiple conﬁgurations for the same
model. Also, Toyota dealerships may be more conservative toward demand loss than
we assume (e.g., due to the long-term revenue from automobile maintenance).
We also examine the inventory usage under the two initial inventory levels by cal-
culating the ending inventory, which partially captures how the inventory matches the
demand. The ending inventory is further characterized by the ending on-hand and net
inventories. The results for the ending inventory are illustrated in Fig.4.3, and some
basic statistics are provided in Table4.2. In Fig.4.3(a) and (b), the horizontal axis
represents the inventory levels and the vertical axis represents their corresponding
probability masses.
As previously mentioned, the empirical data imply that the dealership keeps an
inventory level that is substantially higher than the optimal level projected by our
theoretical model. The ending inventory statistics show that even if the high real-life
inventory level does lead to an overstock, the upgrade mechanism can effectively
ameliorate the negative effect. First, the theoretical optimal initial inventory of 194
is more likely to lead to a near-zero ending on-hand inventory (the probability mass

is 0.9227), and the real-life level of 360 leads to a slightly higher ending level on
average. However, the gap between the ending inventories is much smaller than the
initial gap at the beginning. Without upgrades, the expected ending on-hand inventory
should be roughly 360 −0.1469 ∗1.440 = 148. The actual ending level of 2.47 is
dramatically lower, which indicates that the upgrade mechanism plays an important
role in the process. The same logic can be applied to the case in which the initial
inventory is 194. The expected ending on-hand inventory considering only the short
orders should be 194 −148 = 46, and the actual level is 0.3024. This also indicates
that the upgrade has been used in the process. Second, although the ending on-hand
inventories exhibit different patterns, the ending net inventories in the two cases are
similar because, as we show in our preceding analysis, the upgrade mechanism has
no effect on the evolution of the net inventory and both levels of 194 and 360 are
large enough to prevent severe demand loss. These results show that the upgrade
mechanism could help dealerships to effectively reduce inventory risk and achieve
better inventory usage.
4.5
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we extend the unitary inventory control policy discussed in Chap.3
to the general upgrade policy. The seller can choose the time to deliver the back-
logged long lead-time orders. To facilitate analysis, we adopt a variable substitution
to replace the outstanding long orders by the net inventory, which equals the on-hand
inventory level minus the number of promised-for-delivery orders. In our analysis,
we resort to the technique of anti-multimodularity to derive the structural properties
of the value function. At last, we calibrate the model parameters using the empirical
data collected from Toyota China dealerships and calculate the optimal policies and
several performance metrics accordingly. The results show that the upgrade mecha-
nism can improve both proﬁt and inventory usage.

Inventory Models with Delivery-Time Upgrade
Appendix 1
This appendix contains some of the proofs. The proofs for the results in the non-
capacitated case are omitted to save space because they are similar to those in Chap.3.
Proof of Lemma 4.4
Proof We ﬁrst introduce the connection between multimodularity and convexity. A
function f deﬁned on Zm can be extended to a corresponding f deﬁned on Rm by
conducting linear interpolation on atoms. In our model, the atoms are in the form
of {(n, mn), (n −1, mn), (n −1, mn −1)} and {(n, mn), (n, mn −1), (n −1, mn −
1)}. The function f is uniquely deﬁned.
Theorem 4.8 (Altman et al. 2003) f is multimodular if and only if f is convex.
The following corollary is then straightforward.
Corollary 4.1
f is anti-multimodular if and only if f is concave.
We use induction to prove the lemma. First, at the end of the cycle, it is clear that the
terminal value function, V Q(T, n, mn), satisﬁes all three properties. Assume that the
properties hold for V Q(t + 1, n, mn). We prove that they still hold for V Q(t, n, mn).
It is obvious that the AMM is preserved under linear summation. Hence, to prove
V Q(t, n, mn) is AMM in (−n, mn), we prove that in the dynamic programming recur-
sion all of the terms preserve the AMM, in particular the ﬁrst three terms associated
with the seller’s inventory-control decisions. Without loss of generality, our follow-
ing analysis focuses on the term max{V Q(t + 1, n −1 −us, mn −1) + p f , V Q(t +
1, n, mn −1) + p f , V Q(t + 1, n −u0, mn)}.
Deﬁne an operator A as follows.
A (V Q(t + 1, n, mn)) = max{V Q(t + 1, n −1 −us, mn −1) + p f ,
V Q(t + 1, n, mn −1) + p f , V Q(t + 1, n −u0, mn)}.
To avoid the trouble of checking all of the conditions separately, we make use of the
equivalence between the AMM and continuous joint concavity. We ﬁrst introduce
the following notations:
V Q:
the linear interpolation of V Q;
A (V Q):
the optimization on V Q;
A (V Q):
the optimization on V Q; and

A (V Q):
the linear interpolation of the optimized function A (V Q).
Based on Corollary 4.1, if V Q(t + 1, n, mn) is AMM in (−n, mn), its linear inter-
polation V Q(t + 1, x, y) is jointly concave in (−x, y). Then, we prove that after
the optimization, A (V Q(t + 1, x, y)) is also jointly concave. The second step is to

Appendix 1
57
prove that A (V Q(t + 1, x, y)) is equivalent to 
A (V Q). This actually indicates that
the order of linear interpolation and optimization can be switched without affecting
the ﬁnal result. In summary, the two steps are as follows:
1. A (V Q(t + 1, x, y)) is jointly concave in (−x, y); and
2. A (V Q(t + 1, x, y)) ≡

A (V Q(t + 1, n, mn)).
After we prove that 
A (V Q) is jointly concave, according to Corollary 4.1, A (V Q)
is AMM.
The operator, A , is deﬁned on a discrete-state space. We now extend its deﬁnition
to a continuous-state space. Note that the feasible area for our problem is
n ≥mn, mn ≥0;
n ≥0,
mn < 0 .
We divide the feasible area into atoms, and obtain A (V Q(t + 1, x, y)) by conducting
linear interpolation on those atoms.
Similar to the discrete optimization, we now deﬁne A (V Q) as follows:
A (V Q(t + 1, x, y)) =
max
uy∈U (x,y−α),0≤α≤1{V Q(t + 1, x −uy, y −α) + αpl},
where
U (x, y −α) = {u : 0 ≤u ≤x ∧(x −y + α), u ∈R}.
Given
that
V Q
(t, x, y) is the piecewise linear interpolation of V Q(t, n, mn), the continuous form
of A subsumes the original discrete form, which is stated below.
Lemma 4.6 At points where x = n, y = mn are integers,
A (V Q(t + 1, x, y)) =
max
u0∈U (n,mn),
us∈U (n−1,mn−1)
{V Q(t + 1, n −1 −us, mn −1) + p f ,
V Q(t + 1, n, mn −1) + p f , V Q(t + 1, n −u0, mn)}.
Step 1:
In this part, we prove that A (V Q(t + 1, x, y)) preserves the concavity. For the
continuous function, the joint concavity in (x, y) is equivalent to the joint concavity
in (−x, y); thus, we simply use (x, y) without loss of generality.
We ﬁrst prove that V Q(t + 1, x −uy, y −α) + αp f
is jointly concave in
(x, y, uy, α) based on the deﬁnition of joint concavity. For any two points (x1, y1,
uy,1, α1) and (x2, y2, uy,2, α2), let x3 = ρx1 + (1 −ρ)x2, y3 = ρy1 + (1 −ρ)y2,
u3 = ρuy,1 + (1 −ρ)uy,2, α3 = ρα1 + (1 −ρ)α2, where 0 < ρ < 1. Given that
V Q(t + 1, x, y) is jointly concave in (x, y), we can prove that
V Q(t + 1, x3 −uy,3, y3 −α3) + α3 p f
≥ρ[V Q(t + 1, x1 −uy,1, y1 −α1) + α3 p f ] + (1 −ρ)(V Q(t + 1, x2 −uy,2, y2 −α2) + α3 p f ).

58

Inventory Models with Delivery-Time Upgrade
Also noting that {(x, y, uy, α) : x ≥y+, 0 ≤uy ≤x ∧(x −y + α), 0 ≤α ≤1} is
a convex set, we ﬁnd that A (V Q(t + 1, x, y)) is jointly concave in (x, y).
Step 2:
We next show that A (V Q) is equivalent to 
A (V Q). That is, at any feasible point
(x, y), the value of A (V Q) equals that of

A (V Q). To prove this equivalence, we
prove that the value under the operator A (V Q) at (x, y) within the feasible region
is reachable by the operator

A (V Q) and vice versa, i.e., A (V Q) ≤

A (V Q) and
A (V Q) ≥

A (V Q). Hence, the equivalence can be established.
We ﬁrst introduce the following preliminary result to facilitate the proof.
Lemma 4.7 For the three vertices of an atom, under A (V Q), the points at which
they take values are still vertices of a speciﬁc atom.
We provide a sketch of the proof as follows. Denote the three vertices of an atom by
(n1, mn1),(n2, mn2),and(n3, mn3).SupposethatA (V Q(t + 1, n1, mn1)) = V Q(t +
1, n∗
1, m∗
n1) + (mn1 −m∗
n1)p f . (n∗
1, m∗
n1) is the point at which (n1, mn1) takes a value
under A (V Q). Denote those for (n2, mn2) and (n3, mn3) by (n∗
2, m∗
n2) and (n∗
3, m∗
n3),
respectively. Given that V Q is the linear interpolation of V Q, (n∗
1, m∗
n1), (n∗
2, m∗
n2),
and (n∗
3, m∗
n3) are all integer points. Moreover, because V Q is AMM, (n∗
1, m∗
n1),
(n∗
2, m∗
n2), and (n∗
3, m∗
n3) are still vertices of the same atom.
With the aid of Lemma 4.7, we now prove the equivalence of A (V Q) and 
A (V Q).
First, we prove that the optimal values for

A (V Q) can be achieved by A (V Q). If
V Q(t + 1, n, m) is optimized ﬁrst, for a given point (x, y) located within a speciﬁc
atom, its value after the linear interpolation equals the weighted sum of the optimal
values of the three vertices of that atom. According to Lemma 4.7, the optimal values
of the three vertices are the values of the vertices of a speciﬁc atom. Hence, the value
at (x, y) can be reproduced in that speciﬁc atom.
Next, we prove that the reverse also holds. Consider A (V Q). For a point (x, y)
within an atom, referred to as Φ, every point within its optimization domain can
be expressed as the weighted sum of the values of the vertices of some atom (the
shift parameter, αp f , does not affect this result). Also note that those vertices fall
within the respective optimization domain of the three vertices of Φ. This implies
that A (V Q) ≤

A (V Q).
Given the results from Steps 1 and 2, we know that A (V Q(t + 1, n, mn)) is AMM
in (−n, mn).
We now look at the ﬁrst two terms in the dynamic programming recursion. The
proof of the AMM of max V Q(t + 1, n −u0, mn) is straightforward because the opti-
mization only involves n. Regarding max{V Q(t + 1, n −1 −us, mn −1) + ps,
V Q(t + 1, n −u0, mn)}, using a logic similar to that in the proof of the ﬁrst term,
we deﬁne an operator B as
B(V Q(t + 1, x, y)) =
max
uy∈U (x,y−α),0≤α≤1{V Q(t + 1, x −uy, y −α) + αps}.
The rest of the proof then follows that of the AMM of max{V Q(t + 1, n −1 −
us, mn −1) + p f , V Q(t + 1, n, mn −1) + p f , V Q(t + 1, n −u0, mn)}.

Appendix 1

Proof of Theorem 4.6
Proof First, let △V Q(1, n, n) = V Q(1, n + 1, n + 1) −V Q(1, n, n). Deﬁne n∗(1)
as the smallest n that satisﬁes △V Q(1, n, n) < c and n∗∗(1) as the smallest n that
satisﬁes △V Q(1, n, n) < c + cp. From the AMM property of V Q(1, n, n), we have
n∗(1) ≥n∗∗(1) and V Q(0, n∗, n∗) ≥V Q(0, n∗∗, n∗∗).
n∗(1) can be considered as the base-stock level without capacity constraint. It is
optimal for the seller to order up to n∗(1) if it is within the capacity limit, and not
to order if n(0) ≥n∗(1). The question is how to replenish when n∗(1) exceeds the
capacity limit. We list all of the possibilities as follows:
1. if n(0) ≥n∗(1), it is optimal not to order;
2. if n∗(1) −Q ≤n(0) < n∗(1), it is optimal to order up to n∗(1); and
3. if n(0) < n∗(1) −Q, it is optimal to order up to n∗∗(1) ∨(n(0) + Q).
Appendix 2: The Derivation of Parameter Values
This appendix contains the derivation of the parameter values used in the numerical
studies in Sect.4.4. As mentioned in Sect.4.4, the model parameters can be put
into two categories: those related to the revenue structure, including ps, p f , c, h,
and s, and the customer arrival rates, including πs and π f . The revenue-structure
parameters are retrieved directly from public sources. The two prices, p f and ps,
are simply considered as the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) and the
marked-up price for spot sales, respectively. The mark-up degree is about 10 % of
the MSRP. We use the common operating margin and p f to derive c. The common
operating margin is 10% so c is set to 91. For s, rather than the true salvage value,
we refer to the depreciated value of the car. As the duration of a cycle is set as one
month (which will be explained later), s is set to 98% of c. We assume that there is
no backorder cost. The inventory holding cost h is considered to be the ﬁnancing cost
rather than the literal “holding cost.” Automakers usually require instant payment
from dealerships upon placing orders, but dealerships do not receive full payment
from customers until delivery. Although we are aware of other operating expenses,
we consider this ﬁnancial cost as the main source of h. We use the benchmark one-
year lending rate issued by the People’s Bank of China, which was 5.31 % at the
time of writing, as the loan interest rate. Hence, h is calculated as the daily interest.
The parameters related to the revenue structure are summarized in Table4.3. All of
the values are denominated in Chinese yuan (CNY).

Inventory Models with Delivery-Time Upgrade
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Arrival Rates from the Empirical
Data
Customer arrival rates are not directly retrievable and must be estimated from the
empirical data. As detailed in Chap.2, over the years, the dealerships have developed
a comprehensive customer relationship management tool known as e-CRB. i-CROP,
a component of e-CRB, classiﬁes potential customers into four classes (A, B, C, and
D) based on their desired delivery times. The delivery times are one week, one month,
three months, and more than three months after the purchasing time, respectively.
We consider this classiﬁcation as a good ﬁt for our lead-time differentiated model.
We collected the daily classiﬁcation data in June and July 2009 by recording the
daily arrivals of class A, B, C, and D customers at a dealership requesting a speciﬁc
automobile model. Toyota operates a moving-window type of order planning prac-
tice with its dealerships. Dealerships are required to provide order numbers three
months before the delivery date. Two months before the delivery, dealerships have
the opportunity to adjust the order quantities previously placed within a certain range.
One month before the delivery, Toyota ﬁxes the order quantity but allows dealerships
to make changes to the color. In this setting, we consider class A and B customers as
short lead-time customers, and class C and D customers as long lead-time customers.
This data categorization also comes from the observation that dealerships demand a
premium for delivery within one or two months. The length of a cycle is set to one
month (thirty days).
Sixty samples were collected. After analyzing the data and considering the unitary
demand assumption in our model, we assume that there are 48 periods per day. We
use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to derive πs and π f . Given
that there are k days,
πs =
k	
i=1
ysi
48k , πl =
k	
i=1
y f i
48k ,
where ysi and y f i represent the daily numbers of short and long lead-time customers
in day i. From the data, we can obtain the values of πs and π f : πs = 0.1469, and
π f = 0.1833.

Chapter 5
Inventory Control and Pricing
with Alternative Delivery Times
Abstract In this chapter, we consider joint inventory and pricing decisions. The
seller can adjust the price to control the arrival rates directly. We derive the optimal
joint policies and then compare the two mechanisms using a hybrid model in which
the seller must choose between the two control means in each period. Our results
indicate that the inventory decision is meaningful in the high-inventory case, and
the pricing decision is advantageous when the inventory level is low. We further
demonstrate the equivalence of the two models and show that the optimal policy in
the hybrid model is a switching policy characterized by a switching threshold.
5.1
Introduction
In the previous two chapters, we discuss the inventory control policies for inventory
models with two alternative delivery lead times. In those models, the seller maximizes
its proﬁt through inventory decisions, such as whether to upgrade outstanding long
lead-time orders and reject incoming orders. The prices for the delivery options are
assumed given. In this chapter, we consider the possibility of price adjustment and
study the optimal joint pricing and inventory control policies.
The incorporation of the pricing decision is of interest and value for several rea-
sons. First, the ﬁxed-price assumption is appropriate when prices are determined by
the market and relatively rigid. However, there are also cases in which ﬁrms are able
to adjust the prices to reﬂect the real-time demand-supply situation. Note that the
price adjustment can be realized in a variety of forms such as through personalized
coupons or bundling. For example, in the Toyota dealership example introduced in
Chap.2, dealerships may ask those customers who choose spot delivery to buy a
bundled insurance product or upgrade the conﬁguration of the car. The study of the
optimal joint policies thus can help with ﬁrms’ decision making. Second, as we show
in later analysis, in the presence of the delivery-lead-time-based customer segmen-
tation, inventory and pricing decisions have similarities and differences. Both means
aim to maximize ﬁrms’ proﬁt, but each has its own merit. The inventory decision
can mimic the pricing decision through a probabilistic upgrade policy in certain cir-
cumstances, and the pricing decision affects the customer arrival rates and revenue

directly. To better illustrate these points, we consider the two mechanisms in two
different scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario, the seller makes inventory and pricing deci-
sions jointly, and in the second scenario, the seller uses only one of the two means in
each period. An interesting ﬁnding is that the two scenarios are actually equivalent
in certain model settings.
In the remainder of this chapter, Sect.5.2 presents the formulation of the joint-
decision problem. In Sect.5.3, we obtain the optimal joint inventory and pricing deci-
sions. In Sect.5.4, we consider another scenario in which the seller can choose only
one control means and show its equivalence to the joint-decision model. Section5.5
concludes the chapter.
5.2
Model Formulation
The model setup still follows that of the non-capacitated upgrade model in Chap.4,
only now we incorporate the pricing decision into the model. We assume the seller can
adjust the price of the short delivery lead-time option, i.e., ps. The price is announced
at the beginning of each period and determines the demand rates, πs and πf , in that
period. We assume that customers are myopic, i.e., they are neither backward- nor
forward-looking.
To facilitate analysis, we make several simplifying assumptions. We assume that
the adjustment of ps only induces demand cannibalization. That is,
∂πs
∂ps
≤0, ∂πf
∂ps
≥0, and ∂π0
∂ps
= 0.
(5.1)
The ﬁrst two inequalities are intuitive. The last equation indicates that the price
adjustment does not incur any demand gain/loss. For example, in the Toyota dealer-
ship example in Chap.2, dealerships can adjust the price premium they charge for
the spot-delivery option. As the premium increases, more customers are likely to
switch from the spot option to the consignment option, but they buy anyway.
Note that there is a monotonic mapping between ps and πs. We thus can use πs
to replace ps for analytical convenience. The inequalities in (5.1) can be rewritten as
follows:
∂ps
∂πs
≤0, ∂πf
∂πs
≤0, and ∂π0
∂πs
= 0.
(5.2)
Also, given that πs + πf + π0 = 1, we know that
1 + ∂πf
∂πs
= 0, and ∂2πf
∂π2s
= 0.

5.2 Model Formulation
65
Another assumption is made for the one-period revenue function πsps + πf pf . We
assume that it is twice differentiable and concave in πs. That is,
∂2(πf pf + πsps)
∂π2s
≤0.
This assumption is consistent with the dynamic pricing literature. It is easy to verify
that the concavity holds for common demand forms such as linear, multinomial logit
(MNL), and Cobb-Douglas models.
Denote the feasible range of πs as [πs, πs]. Correspondingly, the range of πf is
[πf , πf ]. The dynamic programming equations can be written as follows:
V (t, n, mn) =
max
πs∈[πs,πs]{πsps + πs
max
us∈U (n−1,mn−1) V (t + 1, n −1 −us, mn −1)
+ πf pf + πf
max
uf ∈U (n,mn−1) V (t + 1, n −uf , mn −1)}
+ π0
max
u0∈U (n,mn) V (t + 1, n −u0, mn) −hn,
V (t, 0, mn) = (π0 + πs)V (t + 1, 0, mn) + πf [pf + V (t + 1, 0, mn −1)],
V (T, n, mn) = −cm−
n + sm+
n .
(5.3)
Note that ps and πf are both functions of πs. It is obvious that when n(t) = 0, the
optimal policy is to set πs to πs to induce as many customers as possible to choose
the long lead-time option.
5.3
Optimal Inventory Control and Pricing Policy
We start with a single-cycle problem and deduce the following structural properties
of the value function.
Lemma 5.1
1. V (t, n, mn) is integer concave in n;
2. V (t, n, mn) is modular in n and mn.
Lemma 5.1 shows that the value function still exhibits the same properties as in an
inventory-control-only model. Based on the structural properties, the optimal joint
pricing and upgrade policies can be obtained as follows.
Theorem 5.1 In each period t, there exist an optimal price p∗
s and a threshold level
CL(t). It is optimal for the seller to upgrade the inventory level down to CL(t) if
n(t) > CL(t) and set ps to p∗
s, which is a function of n(t) ∨CL(t).
Theorem 5.1 indicates that the optimal price is not ﬁxed but rather contingent on
the inventory level. Furthermore, we can prove the following monotonic relationship
between p∗
s and n(t).

Inventory Control and Pricing with Alternative Delivery Times
Corollary 5.1 In period t, the optimal price p∗
s is non-increasing in n(t).
The derivation of the optimal inventory replenishment policy is the same as that in
Chap.4 because no pricing decision is involved. An additional property is necessary.
Lemma 5.2 V (t, n, mn) is integer concave in mn(t).
Atthebeginningofthecycle,weassumethesellerstartswithaninitialinventoryn(0).
The inventory replenishment decision can be expressed by the following equation:
max
n(1)≥n(0){V (1, n(1), n(1)) −c[n(1) −n(0)]}
= cn(0) +
max
n(1)≥n(0){V (1, n(1), n(1)) −cn(1)}.
Given the structural properties in Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, we can derive the optimal
inventory replenishment policy.
Theorem 5.2 The optimal inventory replenishment at the beginning of the cycle
follows a base-stock type.
The extension to the multi-cycle problem is straightforward.
Lemma 5.3 In period t, V (t, n, mn) satisﬁes the following properties.
Integer concavity in n:
V (t, n + 1, mn) −V (t, n, mn) ≤
V (t, n, mn) −V (t,
n −1, mn);
Integer concavity in mn:
V (t, n, mn + 1) −V (t, n, mn) ≤V (t, n, mn) −V (t, n,
mn −1);
Modularity in n and mn:
V (t, n + 1, mn) −V (t, n, mn) = V (t, n + 1, mn + 1) −
V (t, n, mn + 1).
Theorem 5.3 For the multi-cycle problem, the optimal upgrade policy in a period is
the same as that described in Theorem 5.1, and the optimal inventory replenishment
at the beginning of each cycle follows a base-stock type.
5.4
Comparison of Inventory Control and Dynamic Pricing
In the previous section, we derive the optimal joint inventory control and pricing
policies. The inventory decision in our model is realized through a delivery upgrade,
and the pricing decision can be used to directly affect the arrival rates. It is also inter-
esting to compare the two mechanisms and study their similarities and differences.
For example, in Maglaras and Meissner (2006), they try to ﬁnd a uniﬁed framework
to study these two types of problems. In their setting, the inventory control involves
choosing a mixed strategy for menu selection. They derive a common structure for the
two problems and compare their performances numerically. In Lin et al. (2008), they
study both capacity allocation and dynamic pricing using the framework of stochastic

67
knapsack problems. The optimal policy is a switch-over policy. For capacity alloca-
tion, the prices are assumed to be given exogenously and the decision is to choose the
timing when low-price orders are supplied. Using the same approach, they discuss
the pricing model, which can be viewed as an optimal markdown process.
To compare the two mechanisms, we consider a model in which the seller must
choose between inventory control and dynamic pricing in each period. We call this
model the hybrid model, as opposed to the joint model discussed in preceding analy-
sis. The hybrid model can shed light on the conditions under which one mechanism
is preferred. For analytical convenience, we make one change to the upgrade policy
in the hybrid model: we assume that the upgrade is probabilistic. That is, there is
a probability associated with each feasible upgrade quantity. Note that the change
to the probabilistic upgrade does not affect our previous results, but make inventory
control and dynamic pricing comparable.
5.4.1
The Hybrid Model
In the hybrid model, the seller chooses either dynamic pricing or inventory control in
each period. In the case of inventory control, we assume that the seller chooses to set
πs (ps) to π∗
s (p∗
s), the value that maximizes the one-period revenue. Correspondingly,
the other two arrival rates are denoted as π∗
f and π∗
0 , respectively. The dynamic
programming recursion for the hybrid model can be written as follows:
V (t, n, mn) = max{V DP(t, n, mn), V UP(t, n, mn)},
V DP(t, n, mn) =
max
πs∈[πs,πs]{πsps + πsV (t + 1, n −1, mn −1)

Inventory Control and Pricing with Alternative Delivery Times
In the preceding equations, Λ0, Λf , and Λs are the probabilistic-upgrade vectors
deﬁned as following:
Λ0 = {λ0(i) : i ∈U (n, mn)},
Λf = {λf (i) : i ∈U (n, mn −1)},
Λs = {λs(i) : i ∈U (n −1, mn −1)}.
We compare inventory control and dynamic pricing by comparing V DP(t, n, mn) and
V UP(t, n, mn). We look at all possible cases.
(a) n(t) > 0.
(i) V (t + 1, n, mn −1) ≤V (t + 1, n −1, mn −1): for dynamic pricing, the seller
should choose a πs ≤π∗
s . This dynamic pricing policy can be easily replicated by the
probabilistic upgrade policy. Furthermore, given that the one-period revenue stays
at the optimum under upgrade, the upgrade policy outperforms the dynamic pricing.
Hence, we have V UP(t, n, mn) ≥V DP(t, n, mn).
(ii) V (t + 1, n, m −1) > V (t + 1, n −1, m −1): for dynamic pricing, the seller
should choose a πs > π∗
s . The probabilistic upgrade policy cannot replicate the
dynamic pricing policy. However, we can derive an upper bound on the performance
gap. Let ps be the price that corresponds to πs.
V UP(t, n, mn) −V DP(t, n, mn)
≥−(π∗
s −πs)[V (t + 1, n, mn −1) −V (t + 1, n −1, mn −1)]
≥−(π∗
s −πs)(ps −h).
The ﬁrst inequality comes directly from the dynamic programming equations, and
the second inequality is based on sample path analysis.
(b) nt = 0.
There is no decision left for inventory control right now. For dynamic pricing, the
seller should choose πs to make πf as high as possible. Hence,
−(πf −π∗
f )(pf −s) ≤V UP(t, 0, mn) −V DP(t, 0, mn)
≤−(πf −π∗
f )(pf −c).
Preceding analysis sheds some light on the advantage of each mechanism. When
the inventory level is high, the upgrade mechanism can be more effective because it
can reduce the inventory without affecting the one-period revenue. However, when
the inventory level becomes low, the upgrade mechanism gradually falls out of favor.
The dynamic pricing mechanism can be used to induce customers to choose the long
lead-time delivery option and thus reduce the demand loss.

5.4.2
The Equivalence of the Hybrid and Joint Models
We devise the hybrid model to compare the pricing and inventory controls. It is
interesting to note that in the current model setting, the hybrid model is actually
equivalent to the joint model.
Theorem 5.4 The joint and hybrid models are equivalent.
The equivalence of the two models depends on our speciﬁc model setting and does
not hold generally. In general, it is obvious that the joint model should outperform
the hybrid model. The following result is straightforward given the equivalence of
the two models.
Corollary 5.2 For the hybrid model, in each period t, there exists a threshold CL(t).
The seller’s optimal policy is to use dynamic pricing when n(t) ≤CL(t) and to use
inventory control otherwise.
The optimal policy for the hybrid model in Corollary 5.2 demonstrates the comple-
mentarity between inventory control and dynamic pricing.
5.5
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we incorporate the pricing decision into the model and consider
the optimal joint pricing and inventory control policies. We also compare the two
mechanisms through an intermediate hybrid model and discuss the circumstances
under which each mechanism outperforms. We also demonstrate that the hybrid
model is equivalent to the joint model. This equivalence can be used to derive the
optimal policy for the hybrid model. The optimal switching policy is of a threshold
type and well justiﬁes the complementarity of the two mechanisms.
Our theoretical analysis and results can be of practical value to real-world busi-
nesses. As indicated by the results, the lead-time-based market segmentation can
complement rather than be dominated by the dynamic pricing. Backlogged long
lead-time orders give ﬁrms extra ﬂexibility when they need to reduce their invento-
ries, and this is achieved without altering the prices.
Appendix
Proof of Lemma 5.1
Proof We prove this result by induction. It is obvious that the terminal function
V (T, n, m) satisﬁes both properties. Assuming that the two properties hold for V (t+
1, n, m), we prove that they also hold for V (t, n, m).

concavity of V (t + 1, n, mn) in n, if πsps + πf pf is strictly concave in πs, then for
given values of n(t) and mn(t), the optimal πs is uniquely determined. Based on the
integer concavity of V (t + 1, n, mn) in n, we have the following result.
Lemma 5.4 For a given mn, maxus∈U (n−1,mn−1) V (t + 1, n −1 −us, mn −1) −
maxuf ∈U (n,mn−1) V (t + 1, n −uf , mn −1) is non-decreasing in n.
We discuss two possible subcases as follows.
Subcase 1: given the concavity of V (t + 1, n, mn), when n(t) is larger than the
optimal on-hand inventory level for mn(t)−1, πs is set to the value of arg max
πs (πsps+
πf pf ) to maximize the one-period revenue.
Subcase 2: if n(t) equals or is smaller than the optimal on-hand inventory level
for m(t) −1, we know the following:
max
us∈U (n−1,mn−1) V (t + 1, n −1 −us, mn −1) = V (t + 1, n −1, mn −1),
max
uf ∈U (n,mn−1) V (t + 1, n −uf , mn −1) = V (t + 1, n, mn −1).

Appendix
71
Let V (t +1, x, mn) represent the continuous counterpart of V (t +1, n, mn) by linear
interpolation. For ∀x ∈R+,
V (t + 1, x, mn) = (⌈x⌉−x)V (t, ⌊x⌋, mn) + (x −⌊x⌋)V (t, ⌈x⌉, mn),
where ⌈x⌉is the smallest integer that is larger than x and ⌊x⌋is the largest integer
that is smaller than x. ⌈x⌉= ⌊x⌋+ 1. Given the integer concavity of V (t + 1, n, mn)
in n, we can obtain the following two results.
Lemma 5.5 V (t + 1, x, mn) is concave in x.
Lemma 5.6 There exists a value of x ∈[0, 1], such that (1 −π0)V (t + 1, n −1 +
x, mn) = πsV (t +1, n−1, mn −1)+(1−π0 −πs)V (t +1, n, mn −1). Furthermore,
x = 1 −πs.
Let
φ(πs) =
πsps + πf pf , if πs ∈[πs, πs];
0,
otherwise.
We can rewrite the value function as follows:
V (t, n, mn) =
max
x∈[πs,πs][φ(x) + (1 −π0)V (t + 1, n −x, mn)]
+π0
max
u0∈U (n,mn) V (t + 1, n −u0, mn) −hn.
We now prove that max
x∈[πs,πs][φ(x)+(1−π0)V (t +1, n−x, mn)] preserves the integer
concavity in n. Denote the optimal x for V (t, n −1, mn), V (t, n, mn), and V (t, n +
1, mn) as x∗, x∗′, and x∗′′, respectively.
{[φ(x∗) + (1 −π0)V (t + 1, n −1 −x∗, mn)] + [φ(x∗′′)
+(1 −π0)V (t + 1, n + 1 −x∗′′, mn)]}/2

2
, mn)]
≤φ(x∗′) + (1 −π0)V (t + 1, n −x∗′, mn).
It is easy to see that the boundary condition at n(t) = 0 and the conjunction at the
optimum also satisfy the integer concavity. Hence, the integer concavity in n(t) holds
for V (t, n, mn).
We skip the proof of modularity as it is similar to the proof of modularity in the
non-capacitated upgrade model.

Proof We use induction to prove this result. First, it is easy to see that the terminal
function satisﬁes the integer concavity. Assume that the concavity holds for V (t +
1, n, mn). We prove that it holds for V (t, n, mn) too.
From previous analysis, we already see that the pricing and upgrade controls
depend on n(t), regardless of mn(t). The integer concavity thus can be carried over.
Proof of Theorem 5.4
Proof First, it is obvious that the joint model dominates the hybrid model, as every
strategy in the hybrid model can be replicated by the joint model. We now show that
the optimal policy in the joint model can be achieved by the hybrid model. According
to Theorem 5.1, when the inventory control, i.e., upgrade, is used, the short lead-time
customer arrival rate is set as π∗
s . When there is no upgrade, the optimal rate is set
according to the inventory level. The former case can be considered as pure inventory
control, and the latter case corresponds to pure dynamic pricing. Hence, the optimal
policy of the joint model is achievable by the hybrid model.

Inventory Commitment and Prioritized
Backlogging Clearance with Alternative
Delivery Times
Abstract In this chapter, we consider prioritized backlogging clearance. Upon the
arrivalofareplenishment,thesellerclearsbackloggedshortandlonglead-timeorders
according to a certain priority rule. Three priority rules are discussed: ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-
served, myopic short ﬁrst-served, and strategic short ﬁrst-served. We characterize
the optimal inventory commitment policies under all three priority rules and then
compare their performances to shed light on the suitable conditions to apply these
rules.
6.1
Introduction
Our analysis of inventory models with alternative delivery lead times so far has
assumed that all of the backlogged long lead-time orders can be cleared at the begin-
ning of the next cycle by either using replenished inventory or incurring a penalty
cost if a supply capacity is exceeded. It is clear that there are exceptions to this
assumption, and these exceptions give rise to new questions that must be answered.
For example, in the Toyota dealership example discussed in Chap.2, Toyota China
usually rolls out a tentative production plan for the coming year at the end of the
previous year, and dealerships need to submit their orders months before the deliv-
ery. All of these factors may make the inventory replenishments rigid rather than
ﬂexible as we assume in preceding analysis. Dealerships thus must deal with the
problem of how to make use of these predetermined inventory replenishments to
clear backlogged orders. The straightforward and intuitive way is to follow the ﬁrst-
come ﬁrst-served (FCFS) rule; however, a priority allocation rule that shifts toward
high-margin but less patient customers may be more appropriate. Through our pri-
vate communications with 4S store managers, we found that dealerships usually
keep a certain level of inventory for impatient customers who are willing to pay a
premium for spot pickup. At the same time, to retain delayed orders, incentives such
as service plans and insurance coverages are frequently offered. The same kind of
prioritized backlogging clearance is also prominent in online retailing. Orders with
different delivery times overlap with each other temporally. Delivering the orders
simply based on their placement time may not be the best strategy.

Inventory Commitment and Prioritized Backlogging Clearance …
In this chapter, we focus on the problem of prioritized backlogging clearance and
evaluate several priority rules. The seller still serves two classes of customers with
different delivery lead-time requirements: short and long lead-time customers. The
orders from both classes of customer can be backlogged at certain costs. The replen-
ishments are ﬁxed and arrive one cycle late. Upon the arrival of each replenishment,
the seller must determine the fulﬁllment of backlogged orders. Three priority rules are
considered: (1) FCFS, (2) myopic short ﬁrst-served (MSFS), and (3) strategic short
ﬁrst-served (SSFS). FCFS does not discriminate between orders from two classes
of customers and clears outstanding orders purely based on their arrival times. In
contrast, MSFS clears orders from short lead-time customers ﬁrst, and SSFS goes
one step further to reserve inventory for future short lead-time customers. We char-
acterize the optimal inventory commitment policies under the three priority rules and
further evaluate their performances with different initial-inventory and replenishment
settings.
In the remainder of this chapter, Sect.6.2 presents the formulation of the prob-
lem and three backlog-clearing priority rules. In Sect.6.3, we derive the optimal
inventory commitment policies for the three priority rules. Section6.4 compares the
performances of the three rules through numerical studies. Section6.5 concludes the
chapter.
6.2
Problem Formulation and Three Backlog-Clearing
Priority Rules
The model setting mostly follows that seen in Chap.3 with several notable changes.
First, we assume that there exists a one-cycle replenishment lead time and that the
replenishment decisions are given. That is, at the beginning of cycle i, the seller
makes a replenishment of Qi, which arrives at the beginning of cycle i + 1. Fixed
replenishment decisions allow us to focus on comparing the three backlog-clearing
priority rules. Second, in addition to long lead-time orders, we assume that short
lead-time orders can be backlogged if the seller runs out of on-hand inventory and
cannot satisfy them immediately. However, the seller incurs a penalty cost cs (loss of
goodwill) when backlogging a short lead-time order. Furthermore, at the beginning
of the next cycle, the seller incurs a penalty cost cpl for each backlogged long lead-
time order if it cannot be ﬁlled and a possibly different penalty cost cps (explained in
more detail later) for each unsatisﬁed short lead-time order. The third change is that
the holding cost is now calculated in each period rather than at the end of a cycle.
This means that the seller can save on the holding cost if it chooses to deliver a long
lead-time order immediately.
At the beginning of a cycle, when the inventory is replenished, the seller chooses
how to clear outstanding backlogged orders. Three backlog-clearing priority rules
are considered: FCFS clears backlogged orders in the sequence of their arrival times;
MSFS clears short ahead of long lead-time orders; and under SSFS, outstanding and

future short lead-time orders have higher priority over outstanding long lead-time
orders. In the remainder of this section, we detail the three priority rules. Throughout
our analysis, we consider the cost-minimization problem.
6.2.1
The FCFS Model
We ﬁrst write out the dynamic programming equations for the seller within a cycle.
Let V F
i (t, n, m) be the cost-to-go function in period t for cycle i. Suppose that there
are I cycles. For 1 ≤i ≤I −1, we have
V F
i (t, n, m) = π0[V F
i (t + 1, n, m) + hn] + πs[V F
i (t + 1, n −1, m) + h(n −1)]
+ π f min
u∈{0,1}{V F
i (t + 1, n −u, m + 1 −u) + h(n −u)}, if n ≥1,
(6.1)
V F
i (t, n, m) = π0V F
i (t + 1, n, m) + πs[V F
i (t + 1, n −1, m) + cs]
+π f V F
i (t + 1, n, m + 1), if n ≤0,
(6.2)
where ui(t) still represents the commitment control imposed on the incoming long
lead-time order. When the seller runs out of on-hand inventory, short lead-time orders
are backlogged rather than lost; thus, n can take negative values, as shown in Eq.6.2.
The absolute value of a negative n represents the number of backlogged short lead-
time orders.
We now look at the inventory dynamics between cycles. At the beginning of
cycle i + 1, the replenishment order placed in cycle i, denoted by Qi, arrives. Under
FCFS, outstanding backlogged orders are ﬁlled as much as possible from the leftover
inventory from cycle i and the newly replenished inventory Qi. If there is any short-
age, i.e., when ni(T ) + Qi < mi(T ), the seller further backlogs these unﬁlled orders
regardless of their lead-time preferences and incurs the same penalty cp = cps = cpl.
The initial inventory position at the beginning of cycle i + 1 is thus updated as
ni(T ) + Qi −mi(T ).
V F
i (T, n, m) = cp(m −n −Qi)+ + V F
i+1(1, n + Qi −m, 0),
(6.3)
where cp(m −n −Qi)+ represents the penalty for further backlogging unﬁlled short
and long lead-time orders when the seller does not have sufﬁcient inventory. All
unﬁlled orders are merged together and reﬂected in a negative inventory position.
The amount of outstanding backlogged long lead-time orders is reset to zero.
For the last cycle I, because there is no future inventory replenishment, long lead-
time orders are either ﬁlled or rejected, and short lead-time orders are ﬁlled to the
extent possible. That is, the seller no longer commits to fulﬁlling orders in the “next”
cycle, and m = 0 throughout cycle I. For 1 ≤t ≤T −1,

(6.5)
And,
V F
I (T, n, 0) = S(n, 0),
(6.6)
where S(n, 0) is the penalty/salvage function. We assume that the function satisﬁes
the following properties.
Assumption 6.1 S(n −1, m) −S(n, m + 1) is non-increasing in n and indepen-
dent of m; S(n −1, m) −S(n, m) is non-increasing in n and non-decreasing in m;
and S(n, m) −S(n, m + 1) is non-increasing in m.
Consider a linear example that S(n, m) = ss(−n)+ + s f m, where ss and s f are
penalty costs for not being able to meet customer orders. It is straightforward to
check that S(n, m) satisﬁes Assumption6.1.
6.2.2
The MSFS Model
In the FCFS model, upon the arrival of an inventory replenishment, the seller ﬁlls the
outstanding backlogged orders to the extent possible. Unﬁlled short and long lead-
time orders are backlogged further and incur the same penalty cost cp. In the next
two models, MSFS and SSFS, we consider priority rules that give higher priority to
outstanding short lead-time orders in the sense that unﬁlled short lead-time orders
incur a higher penalty cost than their long lead-time counterparts, i.e., cps > cpl. We
ﬁrst introduce the MSFS model. In the MSFS model, the seller clears backlogged
long lead-time orders only after clearing all of the outstanding short lead-time orders.
(Note that when cps = cpl, the MSFS model is equivalent to the FCFS model regard-
less of the higher priority given to backlogged short lead-time orders.)
Let V M
i (t, n, m) be the cost-to-go function in period t for cycle i. Within a cycle,
the dynamic programming recursion is the same as that in the FCFS model.
V M
i (t, n, m) = π0[V M

(6.8)
In cycle i, the ending inventory to be carried over to the next cycle is determined
by ni(T ), which can be either positive or negative, mi(T ), and Qi. There are
three possible scenarios: (i) ni(T ) + Qi ≤0; (ii) 0 ≤ni(T ) + Qi ≤mi(T ); and (iii)
ni(T ) + Qi ≥mi(T ). In scenario (i), the seller cannot satisfy all of the backlogged
short lead-time orders; the ending inventory position is thus ni(T ) + Qi, and the
outstanding long lead-time orders remain unchanged. The remaining short and long
lead-time orders incur unit penalty costs cps and cpl, respectively. In scenario (ii), the
seller can satisfy all of the backlogged short lead-time orders, but only part of the out-
standing long lead-time orders. The ending inventory position is 0, and the remaining
long lead-time orders equal mi(T ) −ni(T ) −Qi. In scenario (iii), the seller can ﬁll
all of the backlogged short and long lead-time orders. For 1 ≤i ≤I −1,
V M
i (T, n, m) =

V M
i+1(1, n + Qi −m, 0),
otherwise, m ≤n + Qi.
(6.9)
In the last cycle, long lead-time orders are either ﬁlled or rejected, and short lead-time
orders are ﬁlled to the extent possible.

(6.11)
The terminal condition for the last cycle I is the same as (6.6) with the superscript
F replaced by M. That is,
V M
I (T, n, m) = S(n, m),
(6.12)
where S(n, m) satisﬁes Assumption6.1.
6.2.3
The SSFS Model
In the MSFS model, after all of the outstanding short lead-time orders are satisﬁed,
the remaining inventory is used to ﬁll as many outstanding long lead-time orders as
possible. The leftover inventory is then carried over to the next cycle. If the inventory
is not enough to clear all of the backlogged orders, the seller starts with a negative

inventory position in the next cycle. As a result, all of the short and long lead-time
orders in the next cycle have to be backlogged. We thus consider a priority rule
under which the seller may choose not to clear all of the outstanding long lead-time
orders, but to backlog some of them further. The seller thus can keep some strategic
inventory for the next cycle at the expense of delaying long lead-time orders. We call
this model the strategic short ﬁrst-served (SSFS) model.
Let V S
i (t, n, m) be the cost-to-go function in period t for cycle i. Within a cycle,
the dynamic programming recursion is the same as those in the FCFS and the MSFS
models.
V S
i (t, n, m) = π0[V S

(6.14)
At the beginning of cycle i + 1, i = 1, · · · , I −1, upon the arrival of the replen-
ishment of Qi, the seller allocates only a part of the available on-hand inventory,
denoted by y, to ﬁll the outstanding long lead-time orders. Note that y is constrained
by the on-hand inventory level and the number of outstanding long lead-time orders,
i.e., 0 ≤y ≤min{mi(T ), (ni(T ) + Qi)+}. The value of y can be obtained by solving
the following optimization problem. For 1 ≤i ≤I −1,
V S
i (T, n, m)

Optimal Inventory Commitment Policies
In all three of the models introduced previously, the seller imposes commitment
control over incoming long lead-time orders. One major difference between these
models and those discussed in the previous chapters is that short lead-time orders can
also be backlogged now. This, from a cost-minimization perspective, should induce
the seller to be less willing to choose to deliver a long lead-time order immediately
because backlogging a short lead-time order is more costly. Nevertheless, in our
analysis in this section, we show that the structural properties and optimal policies
still remain very much the same as those we derive for the basic model in Chap.3.
6.3.1
The FCFS Model
From (6.1), we know that the commitment-control policy depends on the values of
V F
i (t + 1, n −1, m) and V F
i (t + 1, n, m + 1). The former corresponds to the action
that commits a unit of on-hand inventory to the long lead-time order, and the latter
corresponds to the action that backlogs the order to the next cycle. We ﬁrst introduce
the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6.1 The marginal cost of inventory commitment is deﬁned as the cost
difference between committing a unit of on-hand inventory and backlogging the
order to the next cycle, i.e., V F
i (t, n −1, m) −V F
i (t, n, m + 1).
We can obtain the following lemma. All proofs are relegated to the appendix.
Lemma 6.1 In period t of cycle i (1 ≤i ≤I −1), the marginal cost of inventory
commitment is (a) non-increasing in n when n ≥1 and 0 when n ≤0, (b) indepen-
dent of m, and (c) independent of Qi.
Part (a) of the lemma indicates that when the seller still has some on-hand inventory,
the higher the on-hand inventory level is, the better it is to commit a unit of on-hand
inventory to a long lead-time order. Furthermore, part (b) reveals that this decision is
independent of the outstanding long lead-time orders. When making the commitment
decision, the seller takes into account the trade-off between the holding cost and the
possible penalty for failing to ﬁll a short lead-time order. As there is no penalty cost
for backlogging long lead-time orders, m does not play any role in the trade-off.
Furthermore, regardless of whether the seller ﬁlls the order immediately or in the

80
6
Inventory Commitment and Prioritized Backlogging Clearance …
next cycle, the difference between the inventory position and outstanding orders,
i.e., n −m, does not change, which means that the penalty cost for running out of
replenished inventory (the ﬁrst term in (6.3)) does not change. Hence, Qi also does
not come into play in the trade-off, and part (c) holds. To characterize the optimal
commitment policy, we deﬁne the commitment level as follows.
Deﬁnition 6.2 For eachm + 1, thecommitment level, denotedbyCL(i, t, m + 1), is
0 if V F
i (t + 1, 0, m) −V F
i (t + 1, 1, m + 1) ≤h; otherwise, the commitment level
is obtained as the maximum value of n for which V F
i (t + 1, n −1, m) −V F
i (t +
1, n, m + 1) ≥h.
Based on this deﬁnition and Lemma6.1, we can characterize the optimal com-
mitment policy for long lead-time orders.
Theorem 6.1 Under FCFS, in period t of cycle i, the following holds.
(a) The optimal commitment policy is characterized by a commitment level
CL(i, t, m).
(b) The commitment level CL(i, t, m) is independent of m and Qi.
(c) The optimal commitment policy is to commit one unit of on-hand inventory
to a long lead-time order if n(t) > CL(i, t, m) and to backlog the order to the next
cycle otherwise.
The following theorem provides some further characterization of the optimal com-
mitment level.
Theorem 6.2 CL(i, t, m) + 1 ≥CL(i, t −1, m) ≥CL(i, t, m).
Theorem6.2 shows how the optimal commitment policy changes with time. It also
facilitates the calculation of the commitment level. The intuition for the results can
be explained as follows. As t increases, there is less time remaining and fewer
potential short lead-time orders. The seller is thus more willing to commit one unit of
on-hand inventory to a long lead-time order. As for the upper bound given by the
ﬁrst inequality, it can be considered as a direct result of the unitary demand arrival
setting.
In addition to Lemma6.1, we can derive the following properties of the cost-to-go
function.
Lemma 6.2 In period t of cycle i, V F
i (t, n, m) is (a) convex in n, (b) convex in m,
and (c) submodular in n and m.
The convexity property in (a) implies that the greater the inventory position, the
smaller the marginal cost reduction. The convexity property in (b) implies that the
more outstanding long lead-time orders there are, the smaller the marginal cost
reduction. The submodularity property in (c) implies that the inventory position and
outstanding orders are economic complements. Based on Lemmas6.1 and 6.2, it is
straightforward to extend preceding analysis to cycle i −1.

6.3 Optimal Inventory Commitment Policies

6.3.2
The MSFS Model
In the MSFS model, the seller clears short lead-time orders ahead of long lead-time
orders upon the arrival of an inventory replenishment. Still using the deﬁnitions
introduced in the discussion of the FCFS model, we can prove the following result.
Lemma 6.3 In each cycle i, the following holds.
(a) The marginal cost of inventory commitment, i.e., V M
i (T, n −1, m) −V M
i
(T, n, m + 1), is non-increasing in n when n + Qi ≤0, independent of n when n +
Qi ≥0, and independent of m.
(b) V M
i (T, n −1, m) −V M
i (T, n, m) is non-increasing in n and non-decreasing
in m.
(c) V M
i (T, n, m) −V M
i (T, n, m + 1) is non-increasing in m.
(d) V M
i (T, n −1, m) −V M
i (T, n, m + 1) is non-increasing in Qi.
Recall that within a cycle, the inventory dynamics in the MSFS model remain the
same as those in the FCFS model. We can thus follow the same approaches used in
the proofs of Lemmas6.1 and 6.2 to derive the structural properties of V M
i (t, n, m).
However, note that the marginal cost of inventory commitment now depends on Qi
and is not independent of Qi as in the FCFS model. MSFS clears short lead-time
orders ﬁrst and changing Qi can lead to different penalty costs in (6.9) at the end of
each cycle.
With the properties described in Lemma6.3, we can characterize the optimal
commitment policy as follows.
Theorem 6.3 Under MSFS, (a) the optimal commitment policy is characterized by
a commitment level CL(i, t, m); (b) the commitment level CL(i, t, m) is independent
of m and non-decreasing in Qi; and (c) the optimal commitment policy is to commit
one unit of on-hand inventory to the long lead-time order immediately if n(t) >
CL(i, t, m) and to backlog it to the next cycle otherwise.
Theorem6.3 reveals that the optimal commitment policy under MSFS is of a thresh-
old type. The commitment level is non-decreasing in Qi. Under MSFS, a larger
replenishment order reduces the possibility of running out of on-hand inventory and
thereby reduces potential penalty costs for further backlogging of unﬁlled orders.
6.3.3
The SSFS Model
The dynamic programming recursion within a cycle in the SSFS model is the same
as that in the FCFS model. We thus focus on the dynamic programming equations
between cycles. We prove the following properties by backward induction: (a) the
marginal cost of inventory commitment, V S
i+1(t, n −1, m) −V S
i+1(t, n, m + 1), is
non-increasing in n, independent of m, and non-increasing in Qi; (b) V S
i+1(t, n −
1, m) −V S
i+1(t, n, m) is non-increasing in n and non-decreasing in m; and (c)

82

Inventory Commitment and Prioritized Backlogging Clearance …
V S
i+1(t, n, m) −V S
i+1(t, n, m + 1) is non-increasing in m. For the last cycle, it is
obvious that the terminal function (6.18) satisﬁes the preceding properties. We now
assume that the foregoing properties hold for V S
i+1(T, n, m). Following a similar
approach to that in the proofs of Lemmas6.1 and 6.2, we can prove that V S
i+1(t, n, m)
(1 ≤t ≤T −1) preserves these properties. To conclude the backward induction, in
what follows, we prove that these properties can also be carried over to V S
i (T, n, m).
We ﬁrst derive the seller’s optimal backlog-clearing policy upon the arrival of Qi.
Let
F(y, m) = cpl(m −y) + V S
i+1(1, n + Qi −y, m −y),
(6.19)
where y represents the inventory that is used to clear backlogged long lead-
time orders and 0 ≤y ≤min{m, (n + Qi)+}. Let ni+1(1) = n + Qi −y, so y =
n + Qi −ni+1(1). Denote n∗
i+1(1) as the minimizer of (6.19). That is,
n∗
i+1(1) = arg min
ni+1(1){cpl[m −n −Qi + ni+1(1)] + V S
i+1(1, ni+1(1), m + ni+1(1) −Qi −n)}.
(6.20)
The following lemma deﬁnes the optimal y, denoted as y∗.
Lemma 6.4 F(y, m) is convex in y and n∗
i+1(1) is independent of n and m. When
n∗
i+1(1) ≥0,
y∗=
⎧
⎨
⎩
0,
if n + Qi ≤0 or 0 ≤n + Qi ≤n∗
i+1(1);
n + Qi −n∗
i+1(1), if n + Qi ≥0 and n + Qi −min{m, n + Qi} ≤n∗
i+1(1) ≤n + Qi;
m,
if n + Qi ≥0 and n∗
i+1(1) ≤n + Qi −min{m, n + Qi}.
Otherwise, y∗= min{m, (n + Qi)+}.
Note that n∗
i+1(1) represents the optimal inventory reserved for future short lead-time
orders and is independent of n and m. If n∗
i+1(1) < 0, it means that the seller should
not reserve any inventory. This could happen, e.g., if Qi is large or the inventory
holding cost is high. In this case, the SSFS model is equivalent to the MSFS model.
After we characterize the optimal inventory policy between cycles, we can prove
that the structural properties we derive for the cost-to-go function in cycle i + 1 can
be carried over to cycle i.
Lemma 6.5 In cycle i, the following holds.
(a) V S
i (T, n −1, m) −V S
i (T, n, m + 1) is non-increasing in n, independent of
m, and non-increasing in Qi.
(b) V S
i (T, n −1, m) −V S
i (T, n, m) is non-increasing in n and non-decreasing
in m.
(c) V S
i (T, n, m) −V S
i (T, n, m + 1) is non-increasing in m.
Note that the marginal cost of inventory commitment, V S
i (T, n −1, m) −V S
i
(T, n, m + 1), is independent of n when n + Qi ≥0 in the MSFS model as stated in
Lemma6.3. In contrast, in the SSFS model, when n + Qi ≥0, V S
i (T, n −1, m) −

6.3 Optimal Inventory Commitment Policies
83
V S
i (T, n, m + 1) is non-increasing in n. The seller may further backlog some out-
standing orders to reserve on-hand inventory for future demands. Hence, a greater
on-hand inventory level can reduce unﬁlled outstanding orders carried over to the
next cycle, and the difference V S
i (T, n −1, m) −V S
i (T, n, m + 1) is smaller.
We are now ready to characterize the inventory commitment policy.
Theorem 6.4 Under SSFS, the optimal commitment policy is characterized by a
commitment level CL(i, t, m), which is independent of m and non-decreasing in Qi.
The optimal commitment policy is to allocate on-hand inventory to a long lead-time
order if n(t) > CL(i, t, m) and to backlog it to the next cycle otherwise.
6.4
Comparative Studies
In this section, we compare the optimal commitment policies under MSFS and SSFS
and identify the conditions that affect their performances. The results elucidate the
conditions under which a priority rule makes more sense. We ﬁrst study the opti-
mal commitment policies under MSFS and SSFS, and then further compare their
performances.
To compare the commitment policies under MSFS and SSFS, we look at the
marginal cost of inventory commitment as deﬁned in Deﬁnition6.1. Noting that the
marginal cost of inventory commitment is independent of m in both the MSFS and
SSFS models, the following result holds.
Lemma 6.6 For given n, V S
i (t, n −1, m) −V S
i (t, n, m + 1) ≥V M
i (t, n −1, m) −
V M
i (t, n, m + 1).
Given that the marginal cost of inventory commitment determines the commitment
level, the following theorem is straightforward.
Theorem 6.5 In each period, the commitment level under SSFS is no less than that
under MSFS.
Theorem6.5 indicates that given the same level of on-hand inventory, the seller is
more likely to backlog long lead-time orders to the next cycle under SSFS.
We now study the system performance with varying initial inventory and replen-
ishment quantities under the two priority rules using a two-cycle model. In the SSFS
model, at the beginning of the second cycle, the seller reserves inventory for the
demands in this cycle, so there is an inventory rationing decision. The commitment
policies and the cost-to-go functions in the two models can be calculated using back-
ward induction. In both models, we assume that S(n, m) = ss(−n)+ + s f m, where
s f = cpl + c and ss = β ∗s f . We list the parameter values in Table6.1.
We draw the contour curves of the cost-to-go functions, i.e., V M
1 (1, n, 0) and
V S
1 (1, n, 0), in relation to the initial inventory and the replenishment in Figs.6.1 and
6.2, respectively. Figure6.3 further quantiﬁes the difference between V M
1 (1, n, 0)

ment is signiﬁcant when the initial inventory is low and the replenishment is large.
This observation agrees with intuition because the strategic inventory reservation by
SSFS makes more of a difference in this case.

Fig. 6.3 Contour curves of the cost difference under MSFS and SSFS
To investigate whether the order retention is worthwhile, we include the lost-sales
model as studied in Chap.3 in the comparison. The setting is as follows. Within a
cycle, the dynamic programming recursion for the lost-sales model is the same as that
fortheSSFSmodel.However,betweenthecycles,inthelost-salesmodel,backlogged
short lead-time orders (i.e., those short lead-time orders that arrive during stock-out)
are lost, incurring a penalty cost that equals −ssn. Outstanding long lead-time orders
are ﬁlled by the on-hand inventory and replenishment. Unﬁlled long lead-time orders
incur a penalty cost that equals s f (m −Q)+ when n ≤0 and s f (m −Q −n)+ when
n is positive. Hence, the seller carries over only on-hand inventory between cycles
in the lost-sales model. Let V F
i (t, n, m) be the cost-to-go function of the lost-sales
model. Thus, for 1 ≤i ≤I −1,
V L
i (T, n, m)
=
−ssn + s f (m −Q)+ + V L
i+1(1, (Q −m)+, (m −Q)+),
if n ≤0;
s f (m −Q −n)+ + V L
i+1(1, (n + Q −m)+, (m −Q −n)+), otherwise.
Figure6.4 shows the comparison between the lost-sales model and the SSFS model
using the value of (V F
1 (1, n, 0) −V S
1 (1, n, 0))/V S
1 (1, n, 0). Under SSFS, the seller
pays cps (cpl) to retain unﬁlled short (long) lead-time orders. The ﬁrst observation is
that the lost-sales model does not necessarily underperform. This is most likely to be
true when the replenishment quantity is low. In this case, simply backlogging unﬁlled
orders further does not improve the overall performance. The second observation is
that SSFS outperforms the lost-sales model when the initial inventory is low and
the replenishment quantity is high. In this case, further backlogging in the SSFS
model helps to reduce the penalty cost, which is inevitable in the lost-sales case.
This observation is also consistent with the real-world practices adopted by car

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we focus on the priority rules in clearing backlogged orders. Three
rules are considered: FCFS treats all backlogged orders uniformly; MSFS clears
short ahead of long lead-time orders; and SSFS allows the seller to reserve inventory
for future short lead-time orders. We characterize the optimal inventory commitment
policies under all three priority rules. We also compare the performances under
MSFS, SSFS, and the lost-sales model. We ﬁnd that the relative performance of
SSFS improves when the initial inventory is low and the replenishment quantity is
large.
Appendix
The proofs of the results in the FCFS and MSFS models are similar to those in Chap.3
and are therefore omitted.

i+1(T, n −1, m) −V S
i+1(T, n,
m + 1) is non-increasing in n and independent of m. We can prove that F(y, m) is
convex in y based on (6.19):
F(y, m) −F(y −1, m)
= −cpl + V S

where the inequality results because V S
i+1(T, n −1, m) −V S
i+1(T, n, m + 1) is non-
increasinginn andthesecondequalityholdsbecause V S
i+1(T, n −1, m) −V S
i+1(T, n,
m + 1) is independent of m. It is clear that there exists an optimal y, denoted as y∗.
Furthermore, as obtained at the beginning of this subsection, because V S
i+1(t, n −
1, m) −V S
i+1(t, n, m + 1) is independent of m, we know that V S
i+1(1, ni+1(1), m +
ni+1(1) −Qi −n) −V S
i+1(1, ni+1(1) −1, m + ni+1(1) −1 −Qi −n) is indepen-
dent of m and n. Hence, n∗
i+1(1) as deﬁned in (6.20) is independent of n and m.
Proof of Lemma6.5
Proof When n + Qi ≤0, (6.15) is reduced to
V S
i (T, n, m) = cps(−n −Qi) + cplm + V S

In this case, n −1 + Qi ≤0. It is easy to show that V S

When α ≤−1,

≥F(0, m) −F(−1, m)
= V S
i (T, n, m) −V S
i (T, n + 1, m + 1),
(6.33)
where the inequality is due to the convexity of F(y, m) in y and the fact that
F(y, m) −F(y −1, m) is independent of m. Hence, based on (6.31)–(6.33), we
know that V S
i (T, n −1, m) −V S
i (T, n, m + 1) is non-increasing in n.
Using the same approach, i.e., by checking different cases according to the value
of α∗, we can prove the properties in (b) and (c). This completes the proof.

Inventory Management with Alternative
Delivery Times: The Case of Group Buying
Abstract In this chapter, we apply the method of modeling and analysis used in
previous chapters to a discussion of the inventory control problem of group buying.
The seller offers two purchasing options to its customers: a regular option and a
group-buying option. The outcome of the group buying is uncertain and affects the
inventory allocation at the end of the selling season. The seller thus can choose to
ration the demand from regular customers to reduce possible penalty. We derive the
optimal inventory rationing policy and demonstrate that it remains robust in several
extensions.
7.1
Introduction
In previous chapters, we discuss inventory models with alternative delivery lead
times. In those models, the seller makes use of customers’ heterogeneous delivery-
time requirements to segment the market by offering two alternative delivery-time
options. Replenishment decisions are made in cycles, and within a replenishment
cycle, the seller resorts to the inventory commitment/upgrade decision that deter-
mines the fulﬁllment of incoming orders to ration its limited inventory. In this chapter,
we deviate slightly from this line of research and show that the same modeling and
analysis approach can be applied to other problems of a similar nature. That is, when
a seller must deal with multiple demand streams using a common inventory pool, it
faces the same trade-off and decision-making problem as in the case of alternative
delivery lead times. The group-buying mechanism shows such an example.
Group buying has emerged as a popular sales strategy in the new millennium. Also
known as collective buying, it offers products and services at signiﬁcantly reduced
prices on the condition that a minimum number of buyers make the purchase. A
common practice of ﬁrms that offer the group-buying option is to set a discounted
price, a starting and a cutoff time, and a minimum number of customers required
for the group formation. Participating customers get the product at the discounted
price only if the ﬁnal number of participants exceeds the predetermined minimum at
the cutoff time. Group buying is similar to a quantity discount in the sense that the
discount is contingent on a participation threshold; however, unlike the traditional

quantity discount, group buying offers a social buying experience because the ﬁnal
outcome relies on the collective action of the buying group.
Given its popularity, group buying is now offered by many sellers as a comple-
ment to the traditional spot-selling option (i.e., the mixed group-buying strategy as
deﬁned in Jing and Xie (2011)). Although sellers can beneﬁt from reﬁned market
segmentation and inventory pooling, the mixed group-buying strategy also adds extra
complexity because sellers must now deal with multiple demand streams. Finding the
optimal inventory management policy thus becomes a critical decision. Motivated by
this real-world problem, we develop analytical models and analyze the correspond-
ing optimal policies. The general setting of these models is as follows. The seller
offers two purchasing options: a group-buying option and a regular (spot-selling)
option. We call customers who choose these two options group-buying customers
and regular customers, respectively. At the beginning of the selling season, the seller
replenishes its inventory and announces the prices of the two options and the partic-
ipation threshold for the group-buying option. Customers arrive sequentially. Given
the uncertainties of the two demand streams and of the ﬁnal outcome of the group-
buying option, the seller can choose to reject the incoming orders from regular cus-
tomers to reserve inventory for the group-buying demand. Based on the preceding
setting, we investigate the optimal inventory management policy for the seller and
generalize our results to a variety of extensions.
Our work ﬁts into the growing line of research related to the group-buying mech-
anism. Previous work has explored the rationale behind the group-buying business
model (Dholakia 2010; Edelman et al. 2011; Jing and Xie 2011; Hu et al. 2013;
Liang et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2014) and analyzed customer behavior using empirical
evidence (Kauffman and Wang 2001, 2002; Kauffman et al. 2010a,b; Zhou et al.
2013). However, less attention has been paid to the operational side of the problem.
We characterize the real-time inventory control policy for a seller simultaneously
dealing with two demand streams and show that this optimal policy is robust to a
variety of generalizations. These results are of practical value for an effective imple-
mentation of the group-buying mechanism.
In the remainder of this chapter, Sect.7.2 presents the formulation of the problem,
and Sect.7.3 gives the optimal inventory control policy. In Sect.7.4, we examine
several extensions of the basic model. Section7.5 concludes the chapter.
7.2
Model Formulation
Consider a seller that offers two purchasing options to its customers over a ﬁnite
time horizon: a regular option and a group-buying option. Customers choosing the
regular and group-buying options are called regular and group-buying customers,
respectively. The regular option, priced at ps, delivers the product to customers
immediately. The group-buying option, priced at pg < ps, backlogs participating
customers and compares the number of total participating customers with a pre-
announced threshold G at the cutoff time to determine whether the group buying is

7.2 Model Formulation
97
successful. If the ﬁnal number of participants is equal to or greater than G, the group
buying is successful and all participating customers get the product at pg; otherwise,
the group buying fails and all participating customers get nothing. We assume the
cutoff time coincides with the end of the selling horizon.
We also divide the selling horizon into T small periods, indexed from 1 to T .
In period t, the on-hand inventory level and number of backlogged participating
customers are denoted as n(t) and g(t), respectively. Within each period before the
last period, we assume that at most one customer arrives. There are three possibilities
in terms of customer arrival: a regular customer, a group-buying customer, and no
customer. The corresponding probabilities are denoted as πr, πg, and π0, respectively.
(Note that the rates can be functions of G and pg and, in the process, be dependent
on t and g to reﬂect customers’ real-time evaluation of the group-buying option.
However, these considerations do not affect our analysis approach and the results.
We thus simply use πr, πg, and π0 throughout the paper.) When a stock-out happens,
the regular demand is lost, incurring a penalty cp. The seller can also choose to
actively reject a regular customer at a cost cp. This demand rejection is to reserve
inventory for the possible group-buying demand. At the end of the selling season,
if the group buying is successful, the seller must satisfy all of the group-buying
customers, and a shortfall incurs a unit penalty cost cg, which incorporates the cost
of delayed fulﬁllment and the marginal cost to satisfy the excess demand (e.g., the
seller may have to source from other sellers to cover the shortage). The inventory
holding cost is calculated in each period before the last period. Let h be the per-unit
holding cost. In period T , any leftover inventory is salvaged at s. To avoid trivial
cases, we assume that the following relations hold: s < pg < ps and pg < cg.
Given the preceding model setting, we now write out the dynamic programming
equations. When 1 < t ≤T ,
V (t −1, n, g) =πr max{V (t, n −1, g) + ps −h(n −1), V (t, n, g) −cp −hn}
+ πg[V (t, n, g + 1) −hn] + π0[V (t, n, g) −hn], for n > 0,
(7.1)
V (t −1, 0, g) = πr[V (t, 0, g) −cp] + πgV (t, 0, g + 1) + π0V (t, 0, g),
(7.2)
V (T, n, g) =

sn,
if g < G;
s(n −g)+ + pgg −cg(g −n)+, if g ≥G.
The seller achieves a higher margin on regular customers and at the same time
ameliorates the inventory risk by introducing the group-buying option. Through the
inventory control, the seller can further reduce the risk of overselling.

7.3
Optimal Inventory Control Policy
Given that customers arrive sequentially and that the outcome of the group buying is
uncertain, the critical problem for the seller is to ﬁnd the optimal inventory control
policy. That is, the seller must determine how to allocate the inventory between the
two classes of customers in real time. We ﬁrst prove the following structural property.
Lemma 7.1 V (t, n, g) is concave in n for given g.
The concavity in Lemma 7.1 implies that the optimal inventory control policy is of
a threshold type.
Theorem 7.1 In each period t, for given g(t), there exists a threshold n∗(t), deﬁned
as the minimum n(t) that satisﬁes V (t, n −1, g) −V (t, n, g) ≥−h −ps −cp,
wheretheoptimalpolicyistorejecttheincomingregularcustomerwhenn(t) ≤n∗(t)
and to accept it otherwise.
In some extreme cases, the derivation of the threshold can be greatly simpliﬁed.
Corollary 7.1 If ps + cp + hT ≥cg, n∗(t) = 0 for all t.
The interpretation of Corollary 7.1 is clear: when the cost of delaying a group-buying
customerormeetingtheexcessdemandislowerthanthatoflosingaregularcustomer,
the seller tends to prefer regular customers over group-buying customers.
With the property of the threshold, we have the following result.
Theorem 7.2 V (t, n, g) is supermodular in n and g.
Theorem 7.2 implies that in period t, n∗(t) is non-decreasing in g(t). That is, group-
buying customers erode the quota for regular customers.
7.4
Elaborations of the Basic Model
The basic model we discuss in preceding analysis can be extended in a number of
directions. In this section, we consider three such directions: batch demand, quantity
ceiling, and multiple group-buying thresholds. Using an analysis approach similar
to that used for the basic model, we show that most of the results we obtain for the
basic model still hold without signiﬁcant changes.
7.4.1
Batch Demand
We consider the case of batch demand, in which customers, both regular and group-
buying, are allowed to purchase multiple units. Correspondingly, the seller now can
choose to partially fulﬁll a batch order placed by regular customers.

7.4 Elaborations of the Basic Model
99
Assume the purchasing amount of a regular customer is i ∈{1, · · · , I} units with
a probability πr,i, and that of a group-buying customer is j ∈{1, · · · , J} units with a
probability πg, j. The dynamic programming equation can be written as follows (for
simple exposition, we write out only the equation when n ≥I).
V (t, n, g) =

J

j=1
πg, j[V (t + 1, n, g + j) −hn] + π0[V (t + 1, n, g) −hn].
(7.3)
We can verify that all of our preceding results remain valid in the batch-demand case.
Theorem 7.3 V (t, n, g) is concave in n for given g and supermodular in n and g.
7.4.2
Group Buying with a Quantity Ceiling
In real-world group-buying practices, in addition to the activation threshold, a quan-
tity ceiling (denoted by G) is often imposed at the same time, which designates the
maximum quantity available for the group buying. That is, the seller ceases to take
in new group-buying customers if the number of participating customers reaches G.
There are two different but equivalent ways to incorporate this constraint into the
base model. The ﬁrst way is to incorporate the effect of G during the selling horizon.
When g < G, the dynamic programming equations remain the same as in Eqs. (7.1)
and (7.2). When g = G, we have
V (t −1, n, G) =πr max{V (t, n −1, G) + ps −h(n −1), V (t, n, G) −cp −hn}
+ (πg + π0)[V (t, n, G) −hn] for n > 0,
V (t −1, 0, G) =πr[V (t, 0, G) −cp] + (πg + π0)V (t, 0, G).
The other way is to reﬂect the quantity ceiling in the terminal function while leaving
the inventory dynamics unchanged. In this case, the terminal function can be written
as
V (T, n, g) =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
sn,

s(n −g)+ + pgg −cg(g −n)+,
if G ≤g < G;
s(n −G)+ + pgg −cg(G −n)+
if g ≥G.
−pg(g −G),

100
7
Inventory Management with Alternative Delivery Times …
The term −pg(g −G) can be considered as the refund to those extra group-buying
customers when g exceeds G. We can see that the dynamic programming equations
remain the same as in the basic model, and the new terminal function also satisﬁes
the concavity. All of the preceding results thus still hold and the optimal inventory
control policy is a threshold-type rationing policy.
7.4.3
Multiple Group-Buying Thresholds
A more general yet more complex form of group buying allows multiple group-
buying thresholds with progressive discounting. Assume that there are M thresh-
olds, denoted by G1 < · · · < G M. These M thresholds are linked to M oppositely
ordered discounted prices, denoted by pg1 > · · · > pgM. The terminal function can
be rewritten as follows:
V (T, n, g) =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
sn,
if g < G1;
s(n −g)+ + pg1g −cg(g −n)+,
if G1 ≤g < G2;
· · ·
s(n −g)+ + pgMg −cg(g −n)+,
g ≥G M.
The change at the terminal function does not affect the concavity, and the optimal
inventory control policy remains of a threshold rationing type. However, the super-
modularity no longer holds now. An intuitive explanation is that as g(t) increases, the
probability of reaching a higher group-buying threshold also increases. This reduces
the margin the seller can get from group-buying customers, which in turn counter-
acts the natural tendency of increasing n∗(t) as g(t) increases. Hence, n∗(t) is not
necessarily increasing in g(t).
7.5
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, using techniques similar to those used in inventory models with
alternative lead times, we discuss the inventory control problem under the mixed
group-buying strategy. We show that the optimal inventory rationing policy is of a
threshold type and that the rationing threshold is contingent on the prevailing number
of customers who participate in the group buying. We also demonstrate that the results
remain robust in several extensions.

Proof of Lemma 7.1
Proof We use backward induction to prove the result. It is easy to verify that the
property is satisﬁed at the terminal. Given that V (t, n, g) is concave in n(t), we now
prove that V (t −1, n, g) is also concave. That is,
V (t −1, n + 1, g) −V (t −1, n, g) ≤V (t −1, n, g) −V (t −1, n −1, g).
From Eq. (7.1), when n(t) > 0, it is proved that the maximization operator pre-
serves the concavity. Both V (t, n −1, g) + ps −h(n −1) and V (t, n, g) −cp −hn
are concave in n(t). It is clear that V (t, n −1, g) −h(n −1) is merely a shift of
V (t, n, g) −hn and that there is at most one junction point within the feasible sup-
port that n(t) ∈[0, ∞). (We omit ps and cp as they do not affect the analysis). We
must thus prove that the concavity holds at the junction point. Assuming the junction
point is n′ > 0 (the proof is straightforward when n′ = 0), we know that the two
forward differences at n′ and n′ −1 are equal. The concavity is thus preserved by
the maximization operator and V (t, n, g) is concave in n(t). The concavity at the
boundary when n(t) = 0 can be proved in the same manner.
Proof of Corollary 7.1
Proof Given that V (t, n, g) is concave in n, to ensure n∗(t) = 0, we must prove
only that V (t, 1, g) −V (t, 0, g) ≤ps + cp + h for ∀t. At the terminal, we know that
V (T, 1, g) −V (T, 0, g) ≤cg. Hence, if cg ≤ps + cp + h, the condition is satisﬁed.
In period T −1,
V (T −1, 1, g) −V (T −1, 0, g)
= πr[V (T, 0, g) + ps] + πg[V (T, 1, g + 1) −h] + π0[V (T, 1, g) −h]

≤max(ps + cp, cg −(T −t)h).
We know that
max(ps + cp, cg −(T −t)h) ≤ps + cp + h
⇐⇒cg ≤ps + cp + (T −t + 1)h.
We need the inequality to hold in period 1, which means cg ≤ps + cp + hT . This
completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 7.2
Proof We use backward induction to prove the result. It is obvious that the terminal
function satisﬁes the supermodularity. Assuming that V (t, n, g) is supermodular in
n(t) and g(t), we now prove that V (t −1, n, g) is also supermodular. That is,
V (t −1, n, g + 1) −V (t −1, n −1, g + 1) ≥V (t −1, n, g) −V (t −1, n −1, g).
We ﬁrst consider the case when n(t −1) > 1. Similar to the proof of the concavity
of V (t, n, g) in n(t), because supermodularity is preserved under addition, we must
prove only that it is also preserved by the maximization operator. To be speciﬁc, we
prove that
max{V (t, n −1, g + 1) + ps −h(n −1), V (t, n, g + 1) −cp −hn}
−max{V (t, n −2, g + 1) + ps −h(n −1), V (t, n −1, g + 1) −cp −hn}
≥max{V (t, n −1, g) + ps −h(n −1), V (t, n, g) −cp −hn}
−max{V (t, n −2, g) + ps −h(n −1), V (t, n −1, g) −cp −hn}.
According to the concavity and supermodularity of V (t −1, n, g), the proof of the
preceding inequality can be reduced to the proof of two speciﬁc cases:
V (t, n −1, g + 1) + ps −h(n −1) −[V (t, n −1, g + 1) −cp −hn]
≥V (t, n −1, g) + ps −h(n −1) −[V (t, n −2, g) + ps −h(n −1)]
⇐⇒ps + cp + h ≥V (t, n −1, g) −V (t, n −2, g).

V (t, n, g + 1) −cp −hn −[V (t, n −1, g + 1) −cp −hn]
≥V (t, n −1, g) + ps −h(n −1) −[V (t, n −1, g) −cp −hn]
⇐⇒V (t, n, g + 1) −V (t, n −1, g + 1) ≥ps + cp + h.
It is clear that both inequalities hold. The supermodularity thus also holds for
V (t, n, g). The case where n(t −1) = 1 can be proved in the same manner.
Proof of Theorem 7.3
Proof We ﬁrst prove the concavity by induction. It is clear that the terminal function
satisﬁes the concavity. From Eq. (7.3), we can prove the concavity by proving that for
each individual maximization operator, the concavity is preserved. The detailed proof
follows the procedure as in the proof of Lemma 7.1 without signiﬁcant modiﬁcations.
We skip the details here.
Based on the same logic, we prove the supermodularity by proving that it is
preserved by each individual maximization operator. The proof of supermodularity
is thus similar to that of Theorem 7.2. We skip the details here.
