Calculus for Business, Economics, and the Social and Life Sciences, Brief Edition,
provides a sound, intuitive understanding of the basic concepts students need as they
pursue careers in business, economics, and the life and social sciences. Students
achieve success using this text as a result of the author’s applied and real-world ori-
entation to concepts, problem-solving approach, straightforward and concise writing
style, and comprehensive exercise sets. More than 100,000 students worldwide have
studied from this text!
Enhanced Topic Coverage
Every section in the text underwent careful analysis and extensive review to ensure
the most beneﬁcial and clear presentation. Additional steps and deﬁnition boxes were
added when necessary for greater clarity and precision, and discussions and intro-
ductions were added or rewritten as needed to improve presentation.
Improved Exercise Sets
Almost 300 new routine and application exercises have been added to the already exten-
sive problem sets. A wealth of new applied problems has been added to help demon-
strate the practicality of the material. These new problems come from many ﬁelds of
study, but in particular more applications focused on economics have been added. Exer-
cise sets have been rearranged so that odd and even routine exercises are paired and the
applied portion of each set begins with business and economics questions.
Just-in-Time Reviews
More Just-in-Time Reviews have been added in the margins to provide students with
brief reminders of important concepts and procedures from college algebra and pre-
calculus without distracting from the material under discussion.
Graphing Calculator Introduction
The Graphing Calculator Introduction can now be found on the book’s website at
www.mhhe.com/hoffmann. This introduction includes instructions regarding common
calculator keystrokes, terminology, and introductions to more advanced calculator
applications that are developed in more detail at appropriate locations in the text.
Appendix A: Algebra Review
The Algebra Review has been heavily revised to include many new examples and ﬁg-
ures, as well as over 75 new exercises. The discussions of inequalities and absolute
value now include property lists, and there is new material on factoring and rational-
izing expressions, completing the square, and solving systems of equations.
New Design
The Tenth Edition design has been improved with a rich, new color palette; updated
writing and calculator exercises; and Explore! box icons, and all ﬁgures have been
revised for a more contemporary and visual aesthetic. The goal of this new design is
to provide a more approachable and student-friendly text.

KEY FEATURES OF THIS TEXT
Applications
Throughout the text great effort is made to
ensure that topics are applied to practical
problems soon after their introduction, providing
methods for dealing with both routine
computations and applied problems. These
problem-solving methods and strategies are
introduced in applied examples and practiced
throughout in the exercise sets.

EXAMPLE 5.1.3
Find the following integrals:
a.
(2x5  8x3  3x2  5) dx
b.
c.
Solution
a. By using the power rule in conjunction with the sum and difference rules and the
multiple rule, you get
b. There is no “quotient rule” for integration, but at least in this case, you can still divide
the denominator into the numerator and then integrate using the method in part (a):

Just-In-Time REVIEW
Since there are 60 minutes in
an hour, 0.61 hour is the same
as 0.61(60) 
minutes.
Thus, 7.61 hours after 6 A.M.
is 37 minutes past 1 P.M. or
1.37 P.M.

5.1.5 through 5.1.8). However, since Q(x) is an antiderivative of Q(x), the funda-
mental theorem of calculus allows us to compute net change by the following deﬁ-
nite integration formula.
Net Change

where t is the number of years after a ﬁxed base
year and D0 is the mortality rate when t  0.
a. Suppose the initial mortality rate of a particular
group is 0.008 (8 deaths per 1,000 women).
What is the mortality rate of this group 10 years
later? What is the rate 25 years later?
b. Sketch the graph of the mortality function D(t)
for the group in part (a) for 0  t  25.
82. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
The gross
domestic product (GDP) of a certain country was
100 billion dollars in 1990 and 165 billion dollars
in 2000. Assuming that the GDP is growing
exponentially, what will it be in the year 2010?
83. ARCHAEOLOGY
“Lucy,” the famous prehuman
whose skeleton was discovered in Africa, has been
found to be approximately 3.8 million years old.
a. Approximately what percentage of original 14C
would you expect to ﬁnd if you tried to apply car-
bon dating to Lucy? Why would this be a prob-
lem if you were actually trying to “date” Lucy?
b. In practice, carbon dating works well only for
relatively “recent” samples—those that are no
more than approximately 50,000 years old. For
older samples, such as Lucy, variations on
carbon dating have been developed, such as
potassium-argon and rubidium-strontium dating.
Read an article on alternative dating methods
and write a paragraph on how they are used.*
84. RADIOLOGY
The radioactive isotope 
gallium-67 (67Ga), used in the diagnosis of
malignant tumors, has a half-life of 46.5 hours. If
we start with 100 milligrams of the isotope, how
many milligrams will be left after 24 hours? When
will there be only 25 milligrams left? Answer
these questions by ﬁrst using a graphing utility to
graph an appropriate exponential function and then
using the TRACE and ZOOM features.
85. A population model developed by the U.S. Census 
Bureau uses the formula
to estimate the population of the United States (in
millions) for every tenth year from the base year

1790. Thus, for instance, t  0 corresponds to
1790, t  1 to 1800, t  10 to 1890, and so on.
The model excludes Alaska and Hawaii.
a. Use this formula to compute the population of
the United States for the years 1790, 1800,
1830, 1860, 1880, 1900, 1920, 1940, 1960,
1980, 1990, and 2000.
b. Sketch the graph of P(t). When does this model
predict that the population of the United States
will be increasing most rapidly?
c.
Use an almanac or some other source to ﬁnd the
actual population ﬁgures for the years listed in
part (a). Does the given population model seem
to be accurate? Write a paragraph describing
some possible reasons for any major differences
between the predicted population ﬁgures and the
actual census ﬁgures.
86. Use a graphing utility to graph y  2x, y  3x,
y  5x, and y  (0.5)x on the same set of axes.
How does a change in base affect the graph of the
exponential function? (Suggestion: Use the
graphing window [3, 3]1 by [3, 3]1.)
87.
Use a graphing utility to draw the graphs of 
y 
, y 
, and y  3x on the same set 
of axes. How do these graphs differ? (Suggestion:
Use the graphing window [3, 3]1 by [3, 3]1.)
88.
Use a graphing utility to draw the graphs of y  3x
and y  4  ln 
on the same axes. Then use
TRACE and ZOOM to ﬁnd all points of
intersection of the two graphs.
89.
Solve this equation with three decimal place
accuracy:
log5 (x  5)  log2 x  2 log10 (x2  2x)
90. Use a graphing utility to draw the graphs of 
y  ln (1  x2)
and
y 
on the same axes. Do these graphs intersect?
91. Make a table for the quantities 
and
, with n  8, 9, 12, 20, 25, 31, 37,
38, 43, 50, 100, and 1,000. Which of the two
quantities seems to be larger? Do you think this
inequality holds for all n  8?

JUST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES
IN PERCEPTION
Calculus can help us answer questions about human perception, including questions
relating to the number of different frequencies of sound or the number of different
hues of light people can distinguish (see the accompanying ﬁgure). Our present goal
is to show how integral calculus can be used to estimate the number of steps a per-
son can distinguish as the frequency of sound increases from the lowest audible fre-
quency of 15 hertz (Hz) to the highest audible frequency of 18,000 Hz. (Here hertz,
abbreviated Hz, equals cycles per second.)
A mathematical model* for human auditory perception uses the formula
y  0.767x0.439, where y Hz is the smallest change in frequency that is detectable at
frequency x Hz. Thus, at the low end of the range of human hearing, 15 Hz, the small-
est change of frequency a person can detect is y  0.767  150.439  2.5 Hz, while
at the upper end of human hearing, near 18,000 Hz, the least noticeable difference is
approximately y  0.767  18,0000.439  57 Hz. If the smallest noticeable change of
frequency were the same for all frequencies that people can hear, we could ﬁnd the
number of noticeable steps in human hearing by simply dividing the total frequency
range by the size of this smallest noticeable change. Unfortunately, we have just seen
that the smallest noticeable change of frequency increases as frequency increases, so
the simple approach will not work. However, we can estimate the number of distin-
guishable steps using integration.
Toward this end, let y  f(x) represent the just noticeable difference of frequency
people can distinguish at frequency x. Next, choose numbers x0, x1, . . . , xn beginning
at x0  15 Hz and working up through higher frequencies to xn  18,000 Hz in such
a way that for j  0, 2, . . . , n  1,
xj  f(xj)  xj1

Think About It

SECTION 1.1
Functions
In many practical situations, the value of one quantity may depend on the value of a
second. For example, the consumer demand for beef may depend on the current mar-
ket price; the amount of air pollution in a metropolitan area may depend on the
number of cars on the road; or the value of a rare coin may depend on its age. Such
relationships can often be represented mathematically as functions.
Loosely speaking, a function consists of two sets and a rule that associates ele-
ments in one set with elements in the other. For instance, suppose you want to deter-
mine the effect of price on the number of units of a particular commodity that will
be sold at that price. To study this relationship, you need to know the set of admis-
sible prices, the set of possible sales levels, and a rule for associating each price with
a particular sales level. Here is the deﬁnition of function we shall use.
For most functions in this book, the domain and range will be collections of real
numbers and the function itself will be denoted by a letter such as f. The value that
the function f assigns to the number x in the domain is then denoted by f(x) (read as
“f of x”), which is often given by a formula, such as f(x)  x2  4.
Function
■
A function is a rule that assigns to each object in a set A exactly
one object in a set B. The set A is called the domain of the function, and the set
of assigned objects in B is called the range.

FIGURE 1.1
Interpretations of the function f(x).
It may help to think of such a function as a “mapping” from numbers in A to num-
bers in B (Figure 1.1a), or as a “machine” that takes a given number from A and con-
verts it into a number in B through a process indicated by the functional rule (Figure 1.1b).
For instance, the function f(x)  x2  4 can be thought of as an “f machine” that accepts
an input x, then squares it and adds 4 to produce an output y  x2  4. 
No matter how you choose to think of a functional relationship, it is important
to remember that a function assigns one and only one number in the range (output)
to each number in the domain (input). Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 1.1.1
Find f(3) if f(x)  x2  4.
Solution
f(3)  32  4  13
EXPLORE!
Store f(x)  x2  4 into your
graphing utility. Evaluate at
x  3, 1, 0, 1, and 3. Make
a table of values. Repeat
using g(x)  x2  1. Explain
how the values of f(x) and g(x)
differ for each x value.

Observe the convenience and simplicity of the functional notation. In Example 1.1.1,
the compact formula f(x)  x2  4 completely deﬁnes the function, and you can indicate
that 13 is the number the function assigns to 3 by simply writing f(3)  13.
It is often convenient to represent a functional relationship by an equation y 
f(x), and in this context, x and y are called variables. In particular, since the numer-
ical value of y is determined by that of x, we refer to y as the dependent variable
and to x as the independent variable. Note that there is nothing sacred about the
symbols x and y. For example, the function y  x2  4 can just as easily be repre-
sented by s  t2  4 or by w  u2  4.
Functional notation can also be used to describe tabular data. For instance,
Table 1.1 lists the average tuition and fees for private 4-year colleges at 5-year inter-
vals from 1973 to 2003.

We can describe this data as a function f deﬁned by the rule
Thus, f(1)  1,898, f(2)  2,700, . . . , f(7)  18,273. Note that the domain of f is the
set of integers A  {1, 2, . . . , 7}.
The use of functional notation is illustrated further in Examples 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.
In Example 1.1.2, notice that letters other than f and x are used to denote the func-
tion and its independent variable.

However, g(1) is undeﬁned since
and negative numbers do not have real square roots.
Functions are often deﬁned using more than one formula, where each individual for-
mula describes the function on a subset of the domain. A function deﬁned in this way is
sometimes called a piecewise-deﬁned function. Here is an example of such a function.

However, x  1 and x  2 satisfy x  1, so f(1) and f(2) are both found by using the
bottom part of the formula:
Determining the natural domain of a function often amounts to excluding all num-
bers x that result in dividing by 0 or in taking the square root of a negative number.
This procedure is illustrated in Example 1.1.4.
EXAMPLE 1.1.4
Find the domain and range of each of these functions.

Solution
a. Since division by any number other than 0 is possible, the domain of f is the set
of all numbers x such that x  3  0; that is, x  3. The range of f is the set of 
all numbers y except 0, since for any y  0, there is an x such that 
in particular, x  3  1

Unless otherwise speciﬁed, if a formula (or several

domain of f to be the set of all numbers for which f(x) is deﬁned (as a real num-
ber). We refer to this as the natural domain of f.

There are several functions associated with the marketing of a particular commodity: 
The demand function D(x) for the commodity is the price p  D(x) that must be
charged for each unit of the commodity if x units are to be sold (demanded).
The supply function S(x) for the commodity is the unit price p  S(x) at which pro-
ducers are willing to supply x units to the market.
The revenue R(x) obtained from selling x units of the commodity is given by the
product
R(x)  (number of items sold)(price per item)
 xp(x)
The cost function C(x) is the cost of producing x units of the commodity.
The proﬁt function P(x) is the proﬁt obtained from selling x units of the commodity
and is given by the difference
P(x)  revenue  cost
 R(x)  C(x)  xp(x)  C(x)
Generally speaking, the higher the unit price, the fewer the number of units
demanded, and vice versa. Conversely, an increase in unit price leads to an increase in
the number of units supplied. Thus, demand functions are typically decreasing (“falling”
from left to right), while supply functions are increasing (“rising”), as illustrated in the
margin. Here is an example that uses several of these special economic functions.
EXAMPLE 1.1.5
Market research indicates that consumers will buy x thousand units of a particular
kind of coffee maker when the unit price is
p(x)  0.27x  51
dollars. The cost of producing the x thousand units is

Example 1.1.6 illustrates how functional notation is used in a practical situation.
Notice that to make the algebraic formula easier to interpret, letters suggesting the
relevant practical quantities are used for the function and its independent variable. (In
this example, the letter C stands for “cost” and q stands for “quantity” manufactured.)
EXAMPLE 1.1.6
Suppose the total cost in dollars of manufacturing q units of a certain commodity is
given by the function C(q)  q3  30q2  500q  200.
a. Compute the cost of manufacturing 10 units of the commodity. 
b. Compute the cost of manufacturing the 10th unit of the commodity.
Solution
a. The cost of manufacturing 10 units is the value of the total cost function when
q  10. That is,
b. The cost of manufacturing the 10th unit is the difference between the cost of
manufacturing 10 units and the cost of manufacturing 9 units. That is,
Cost of 10th unit  C(10)  C(9)  3,200  2,999  $201
There are many situations in which a quantity is given as a function of one variable
that, in turn, can be written as a function of a second variable. By combining the
functions in an appropriate way, you can express the original quantity as a function
of the second variable. This process is called composition of functions or functional
composition.
For instance, suppose environmentalists estimate that when p thousand people
live in a certain city, the average daily level of carbon monoxide in the air will be
c(p) parts per million, and that separate demographic studies indicate the population
in t years will be p(t) thousand. What level of pollution should be expected in t years?
You would answer this question by substituting p(t) into the pollution formula c(p)
to express c as a composite function of t.
We shall return to the pollution problem in Example 1.1.11 with speciﬁc formulas
for c(p) and p(t), but ﬁrst you need to see a few examples of how composite func-
tions are formed and evaluated. Here is a deﬁnition of functional composition.

Note that the composite function f(g(x)) “makes sense” only if the domain of f
contains the range of g. In Figure 1.2, the deﬁnition of composite function is illus-
trated as an “assembly line” in which “raw” input x is ﬁrst converted into a transi-
tional product g(x) that acts as input the f machine uses to produce f(g(x)).
Composition of Functions

Given functions f(u) and g(x), the composi-
tion f(g(x)) is the function of x formed by substituting u  g(x) for u in the for-
mula for f(u).

EXAMPLE 1.1.7
Find the composite function f(g(x)), where f(u)  u2  3u  1 and g(x)  x  1.
Solution
Replace u by x  1 in the formula for f(u) to get
f(g(x))  (x  1)2  3(x  1)  1
 (x2  2x  1)  (3x  3)  1
 x2  5x  5
NOTE
By reversing the roles of f and g in the deﬁnition of composite func-
tion, you can deﬁne the composition g( f(x)). In general, f(g(x)) and g( f(x)) will
not be the same. For instance, with the functions in Example 1.1.7, you ﬁrst
write
g(w)  w  1
and
f(x)  x2  3x  1
and then replace w by x2  3x  1 to get
g( f(x))  (x2  3x  1)  1
 x2  3x  2
which is equal to f(g(x))  x2  5x  5 only when 
(you should verify 
this).
■
Example 1.1.7 could have been worded more compactly as follows: Find the com-
posite function f(x  1) where f(x)  x2  3x  1. The use of this compact notation
is illustrated further in Example 1.1.8.

EXAMPLE 1.1.8
Find f(x  1) if 
Solution
At ﬁrst glance, this problem may look confusing because the letter x appears both
as the independent variable in the formula deﬁning f and as part of the expression
x  1. Because of this, you may ﬁnd it helpful to begin by writing the formula for
f in more neutral terms, say as
To ﬁnd f(x  1), you simply insert the expression x  1 inside each box, getting
Occasionally, you will have to “take apart” a given composite function g(h(x))
and identify the “outer function” g(u) and “inner function” h(x) from which it was
formed. The procedure is demonstrated in Example 1.1.9.
EXAMPLE 1.1.9
If 
ﬁnd functions g(u) and h(x) such that f(x)  g(h(x)).
Solution
The form of the given function is
where each box contains the expression x  2. Thus, f(x)  g(h(x)), where
Actually, in Example 1.1.9, there are inﬁnitely many pairs of functions g(u)
and h(x) that combine to give g(h(x))  f(x). [For example, 
and h(x)  x  3.] The particular pair selected in the solution to this example is the
most natural one and reﬂects most clearly the structure of the original function f(x).

problem.
EXAMPLE 1.1.11
An environmental study of a certain community suggests that the average daily level
of carbon monoxide in the air will be c( p)  0.5p  1 parts per million when the
population is p thousand. It is estimated that t years from now the population of the
community will be p(t)  10  0.1t2 thousand.
a. Express the level of carbon monoxide in the air as a function of time.
b. When will the carbon monoxide level reach 6.8 parts per million?
Solution
a. Since the level of carbon monoxide is related to the variable p by the equation
c(p)  0.5p  1
and the variable p is related to the variable t by the equation
p(t)  10  0.1t2
it follows that the composite function
c(p(t))  c(10  0.1t2)  0.5(10  0.1t2)  1  6  0.05t2
expresses the level of carbon monoxide in the air as a function of the variable t.

SECTION 1.2
The Graph of a Function
Graphs have visual impact. They also reveal information that may not be evident from
verbal or algebraic descriptions. Two graphs depicting practical relationships are
shown in Figure 1.3.
The graph in Figure 1.3a describes the variation in total industrial production in
a certain country over a 4-year period of time. Notice that the highest point on the
graph occurs near the end of the third year, indicating that production was greatest at
that time.
The graph in Figure 1.3b represents population growth when environmental fac-
tors impose an upper bound on the possible size of the population. It indicates that
the rate of population growth increases at ﬁrst and then decreases as the size of the
population gets closer and closer to the upper bound.
To represent graphs in the plane, we shall use a rectangular (Cartesian) coordinate
system, which is an extension of the representation introduced for number lines in
Section 1.1. To construct such a system, we begin by choosing two perpendicular
number lines that intersect at the origin of each line. For convenience, one line is
taken to be horizontal and is called the x axis, with positive direction to the right.
The other line, called the y axis, is vertical with positive direction upward. Scaling
on the two coordinate axes is often the same, but this is not necessary. The coordi-
nate axes separate the plane into four parts called quadrants, which are numbered
counterclockwise I through IV, as shown in Figure 1.4.

The Distance Formula
■
The distance between the points P(x1, y1) and
Q(x2, y2) is given by
D  (x2  x1)2  (y2  y1)2

The distance formula is valid for all points in the plane even though we
have considered only the case in which Q is above and to the right of P.

FIGURE 1.4
A rectangular coordinate system.
Any point P in the plane can be associated with a unique ordered pair of numbers
(a, b) called the coordinates of P. Speciﬁcally, a is called the x coordinate (or abscissa)
and b is called the y coordinate (or ordinate). To ﬁnd a and b, draw the vertical and
horizontal lines through P. The vertical line intersects the x axis at a, and the horizontal
line intersects the y axis at b. Conversely, if c and d are given, the vertical line through
c and horizontal line through d intersect at the unique point Q with coordinates (c, d).
Several points are plotted in Figure 1.4. In particular, note that the point (2, 8)
is 2 units to the right of the vertical axis and 8 units above the horizontal axis, while
(3, 5) is 3 units to the left of the vertical axis and 5 units above the horizontal axis.
Each point P has unique coordinates (a, b), and conversely each ordered pair of num-
bers (c, d) uniquely determines a point in the plane.
There is a simple formula for ﬁnding the distance D between two points in a coordi-
nate plane. Figure 1.5 shows the points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2). Note that the difference
x2  x1 of the x coordinates and the difference y2  y1 of the y coordinates represent
the lengths of the sides of a right triangle, and the length of the hypotenuse is the
required distance D between P and Q. Thus, the Pythagorean theorem gives us the
distance formula
To summarize:
D  (x2  x1)2  (y2  y1)2.
The Distance 
Formula

EXAMPLE 1.2.1
Find the distance between the points 
and 
Solution
In the distance formula, we have 
and 
so the dis-
tance between P and Q may be found as follows:
To represent a function 
geometrically as a graph, we plot values of the inde-
pendent variable x on the (horizontal) x axis and values of the dependent variable y
on the (vertical) y axis. The graph of the function is deﬁned as follows.
In Chapter 3, you will study efﬁcient techniques involving calculus that can be
used to draw accurate graphs of functions. For many functions, however, you can
make a fairly good sketch by plotting a few points, as illustrated in Example 1.2.2.

Then plot the points (x, y) and connect them with the smooth curve shown in
Figure 1.6.
NOTE
Many different curves pass through the points in Example 1.2.2. Sev-
eral of these curves are shown in Figure 1.7. There is no way to guarantee that
the curve we pass through the plotted points is the actual graph of f. However,
in general, the more points that are plotted, the more likely the graph is to be
reasonably accurate.

The graph of 
The points (if any) where a graph crosses the x axis are called x intercepts, and similarly,
a y intercept is a point where the graph crosses the y axis. Intercepts are key features
of a graph and can be determined using algebra or technology in conjunction with
these criteria.
EXAMPLE 1.2.4
Graph the function f(x)  x2  x  2. Include all x and y intercepts.
Solution
The y intercept is f(0)  2. To ﬁnd the x intercepts, solve the equation f(x)  0. Fac-
toring, we ﬁnd that
x2  x  2  0
(x  1)(x  2)  0
x  1, x  2

and the parabola y  Ax2  Bx  C opens up if A  0 and down if A  0. The “peak” 
or “valley” of the parabola is called its vertex and occurs where 
(Figure 1.10; also see Exercise 72). These features of the parabola are easily
obtained by the methods of calculus developed in Chapter 3. Note that to get a rea-
sonable sketch of the parabola y  Ax2  Bx  C, you need only determine three
key features:
1. The location of the vertex 
2. Whether the parabola opens up (A  0) or down (A  0)
3. Any intercepts
For instance, in Figure 1.9, the parabola y  x2  x  2 opens downward (since
A  1 is negative) and has its vertex (high point) where

In Chapter 3, we will develop a procedure in which the graph of a function of
practical interest is ﬁrst obtained by calculus and then interpreted to obtain useful
information about the function, such as its largest and smallest values. In Example 1.2.5
we preview this procedure by using what we know about the graph of a parabola to
determine the maximum revenue obtained in a production process.
EXAMPLE 1.2.5
A manufacturer determines that when x hundred units of a particular commodity are
produced, they can all be sold for a unit price given by the demand function
p  60  x dollars. At what level of production is revenue maximized? What is the
maximum revenue?

Solution
The revenue derived from producing x hundred units and selling them all at 60  x
dollars is R(x)  x(60  x) hundred dollars. Note that R(x)  0 only for 0  x  60.
The graph of the revenue function 
R(x)  x(60  x)  x2  60x
is a parabola that opens downward (since A  1  0) and has its high point 
(vertex) where
as shown in Figure 1.11. Thus, revenue is maximized when x  30 hundred units
are produced, and the corresponding maximum revenue is
R(30)  30(60  30)  900
hundred dollars. The manufacturer should produce 3,000 units and at that level of
production should expect maximum revenue of $90,000.

Note that we can also ﬁnd the largest value of R(x)  x2  60x by complet-
ing the square:
R(x)  x2  60x  (x2  60x)
 (x2  60x  900)  900
900  900
 (x  30)2  900
Thus, R(30)  0  900  900 and if c is any number other than 30, then
R(c)  (c  30)2  900  900
so the maximum revenue is $90,000 when x  30 (3,000 units).
Sometimes it is necessary to determine when two functions are equal. For instance,
an economist may wish to compute the market price at which the consumer demand
for a commodity will be equal to supply. Or a political analyst may wish to predict
how long it will take for the popularity of a certain challenger to reach that of the
incumbent. We shall examine some of these applications in Section 1.4.

In geometric terms, the values of x for which two functions f(x) and g(x) are
equal are the x coordinates of the points where their graphs intersect. In Figure 1.12,
the graph of y  f(x) intersects that of y  g(x) at two points, labeled P and Q. To
ﬁnd the points of intersection algebraically, set f(x) equal to g(x) and solve for x. This
procedure is illustrated in Example 1.2.6.

EXAMPLE 1.2.6
Find all points of intersection of the graphs of f(x)  3x  2 and g(x)  x2.
Solution
You must solve the equation x2  3x  2. Rewrite the equation as x2  3x  2  0
and apply the quadratic formula to obtain
The solutions are

(The computations were done on a calculator, with results rounded off to two deci-
mal places.)
Computing the corresponding y coordinates from the equation y  x2, you ﬁnd
that the points of intersection are approximately (3.56, 12.67) and (0.56, 0.31). [As
a result of round-off errors, you will get slightly different values for the y coordinates
if you substitute into the equation y  3x  2.] The graphs and the intersection points
are shown in Figure 1.13.

THE GRAPH OF A FUNCTION
23
A power function is a function of the form f(x)  xn, where n is a real number. For
example, f(x)  x2, f(x)  x3, and f(x)  x1/2 are all power functions. So are 
f(x) 
and f(x) 
since they can be rewritten as f(x)  x2 and f(x)  x1/3, 
respectively.
A polynomial is a function of the form
p(x)  anxn  an1xn1  . . .  a1x  a0
where n is a nonnegative integer and a0, a1, . . . , an are constants. If an  0, the
integer n is called the degree of the polynomial. For example, f(x)  3x5  6x2  7
is a polynomial of degree 5. It can be shown that the graph of a polynomial of
degree n is an unbroken curve that crosses the x axis no more than n times. To illus-
trate some of the possibilities, the graphs of three polynomials of degree 3 are
shown in Figure 1.14.

A quotient

It is important to realize that not every curve is the graph of a function (Figure 1.16).
For instance, suppose the circle x2  y2  5 were the graph of some function y  f(x).
Then, since the points (1, 2) and (1, 2) both lie on the circle, we would have
f(1)  2 and f(1)  2, contrary to the requirement that a function assigns one and
only one value to each number in its domain. The vertical line test is a geometric
rule for determining whether a curve is the graph of a function.

In many practical situations, the rate at which one quantity changes with respect to
another is constant. Here is a simple example from economics.
EXAMPLE 1.3.1
A manufacturer’s total cost consists of a ﬁxed overhead of $200 plus production costs
of $50 per unit. Express the total cost as a function of the number of units produced
and draw the graph.
Solution
Let x denote the number of units produced and C(x) the corresponding total cost. Then,
Total cost  (cost per unit)(number of units)  overhead
where
Cost per unit  50
Number of units  x
Overhead  200
Hence,
C(x)  50x  200
The graph of this cost function is sketched in Figure 1.17.

The total cost in Example 1.3.1 increases at a constant rate of $50 per unit. As
a result, its graph in Figure 1.17 is a straight line that increases in height by 50 units
for each 1-unit increase in x.
In general, a function whose value changes at a constant rate with respect to its
independent variable is said to be a linear function. Such a function has the form
f(x)  mx  b
where m and b are constants, and its graph is a straight line. For example, 
and f(x)  12 are all linear functions. To summarize:

The steepness of a line can be measured by slope in much the same way. In particu-
lar, suppose (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) lie on a line as indicated in Figure 1.18. Between
these points, x changes by the amount x2  x1 and y by the amount y2  y1. The slope
is the ratio
It is sometimes convenient to use the symbol y instead of y2  y1 to denote the
change in y. The symbol y is read “delta y.” Similarly, the symbol Δx is used to
denote the change x2  x1.

The sign and magnitude of the slope of a line indicate the line’s direction and
steepness, respectively. The slope is positive if the height of the line increases as x
increases and is negative if the height decreases as x increases. The absolute value of
the slope is large if the slant of the line is severe and small if the slant of the line is
gradual. The situation is illustrated in Figure 1.20.

Horizontal and vertical lines (Figures 1.21a and 1.21b) have particularly simple
equations. The y coordinates of all points on a horizontal line are the same. Hence,
a horizontal line is the graph of a linear function of the form y  b, where b is a
constant. The slope of a horizontal line is zero, since changes in x produce no
changes in y.
The x coordinates of all points on a vertical line are equal. Hence, vertical lines are
characterized by equations of the form x  c, where c is a constant. The slope of a

The constants m and b in the equation y  mx  b of a nonvertical line have geo-
metric interpretations. The coefﬁcient m is the slope of the line. To see this, suppose
that (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line y  mx  b. Then, y1  mx1  b
and y2  mx2  b, and so
The constant b in the equation y  mx  b is the value of y corresponding to 
x  0. Hence, b is the height at which the line y  mx  b crosses the y axis, and the
corresponding point (0, b) is the y intercept of the line. The situation is illustrated in
Figure 1.22.
Because the constants m and b in the equation y  mx  b correspond to the slope
and y intercept, respectively, this form of the equation of a line is known as the slope-
intercept form.
The slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is particularly useful when geo-
metric information about a line (such as its slope or y intercept) is to be determined
from the line’s algebraic representation. Here is a typical example.

EXAMPLE 1.3.3
Find the slope and y intercept of the line 3y  2x  6 and draw the graph.
Solution
First put the equation 3y  2x  6 in slope-intercept form y  mx  b. To do this,
solve for y to get
It follows that the slope is 
and the y intercept is (0, 2).
To graph a linear function, plot two of its points and draw a straight line through
them. In this case, you already know one point, the y intercept (0, 2). A convenient
choice for the x coordinate of the second point is x  3, since the corresponding y
coordinate is 
Draw a line through the points (0, 2) and (3, 0)
to obtain the graph shown in Figure 1.23.
Geometric information about a line can be obtained readily from the slope-intercept
formula y  mx  b. There is another form of the equation of a line, however, that
is usually more efﬁcient for problems in which the geometric properties of a line are
known and the goal is to ﬁnd the equation of the line.
The point-slope form of the equation of a line is simply the formula for slope in
disguise. To see this, suppose the point (x, y) lies on the line that passes through a
given point (x0, y0) and has slope m. Using the points (x, y) and (x0, y0) to compute
the slope, you get
which you can put in point-slope form
by simply multiplying both sides by x  x0.

which you can rewrite as
The graph is shown in Figure 1.24.
For practice, solve the problem in Example 1.3.4 using the slope-intercept for-
mula. Notice that the solution based on the point-slope formula is more efﬁcient.
In Chapter 2, the point-slope formula will be used extensively for ﬁnding the
equation of the tangent line to the graph of a function at a given point. Example 1.3.5
illustrates how the point-slope formula can be used to ﬁnd the equation of a line
through two given points.
EXAMPLE 1.3.5
Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (3, 2) and (1, 6).
Solution
First compute the slope
Then use the point-slope formula with (1, 6) as the given point (x0, y0) to get
y  6  4(x  1)
or
y  4x  10
Convince yourself that the resulting equation would have been the same if
you had chosen (3, 2) to be the given point (x0, y0). The graph is shown in 
Figure 1.25.
NOTE
The general form for the equation of a line is Ax  By  C  0, where
A, B, C are constants, with A and B not both equal to 0. If B  0, the line is ver-
tical, and when B  0, the equation Ax  By  C  0 can be rewritten as
Comparing this equation with the slope-intercept form y  mx  b, we see that
the slope of the line is given by m  A/B and the y intercept by b  C/B.
The line is horizontal (slope 0) when A  0.

If the rate of change of one quantity with respect to a second quantity is constant, the
function relating the quantities must be linear. The constant rate of change is the slope
of the corresponding line. Examples 1.3.6 and 1.3.7 illustrate techniques you can use
to ﬁnd the appropriate linear functions in such situations.
EXAMPLE 1.3.6
Since the beginning of the year, the price of a bottle of soda at a local discount super-
market has been rising at a constant rate of 2 cents per month. By November ﬁrst,
the price had reached $1.56 per bottle. Express the price of the soda as a function of
time and determine the price at the beginning of the year.
Solution
Let x denote the number of months that have elapsed since the ﬁrst of the year and
y the price of a bottle of soda (in cents). Since y changes at a constant rate with respect
to x, the function relating y to x must be linear, and its graph is a straight line. Since
the price y increases by 2 each time x increases by 1, the slope of the line must be
2. The fact that the price was 156 cents ($1.56) on November ﬁrst, 10 months after
the ﬁrst of the year, implies that the line passes through the point (10, 156). To write
an equation deﬁning y as a function of x, use the point-slope formula
y  y0  m(x  x0)
with
m  2, x0  10, y0  156
to get
y  156  2(x  10)
or
y  2x  136
The corresponding line is shown in Figure 1.26. Notice that the y intercept is
(0, 136), which implies that the price of soda at the beginning of the year was $1.36
per bottle.

Sometimes it is hard to tell how two quantities, x and y, in a data set are related
by simply examining the data. In such cases, it may be useful to graph the data to
see if the points (x, y) follow a clear pattern (say, lie along a line). Here is an exam-
ple of this procedure.

1-37
SECTION 1.3
LINEAR FUNCTIONS

EXAMPLE 1.3.7
Table 1.4 lists the percentage of the labor force that was unemployed during the
decade 1991–2000. Plot a graph with time (years after 1991) on the x axis and per-
centage of unemployment on the y axis. Do the points follow a clear pattern? Based
on these data, what would you expect the percentage of unemployment to be in the
year 2005?
Solution
The graph is shown in Figure 1.27. Note that except for the initial point (0, 6.8), the
pattern is roughly linear. There is not enough evidence to infer that unemployment
is linearly related to time, but the pattern does suggest that we may be able to get
useful information by ﬁnding a line that “best ﬁts” the data in some meaningful way.
One such procedure, called “least-squares approximation,” requires the approximat-
ing line to be positioned so that the sum of squares of vertical distances from the
data points to the line is minimized. The least-squares procedure, which will be
developed in Section 7.4 of Chapter 7, can be carried out on your calculator. When
this procedure is applied to the unemployment data in this example, it produces the
“best-ﬁtting line” y  0.389x  7.338, as displayed in Figure 1.27. We can then
use this formula to attempt a prediction of the unemployment rate in the year 2005
(when x  14):
y(14)  0.389(14)  7.338  1.892
Thus, least-squares extrapolation from the given data predicts roughly a 1.9% unem-
ployment rate in 2005.

NOTE
Care must be taken when making predictions by extrapolating from
known data, especially when the data set is as small as the one in Example 1.3.7.
In particular, the economy began to weaken after the year 2000, but the least-
squares line in Figure 1.27 predicts a steadily decreasing unemployment rate.
Is this reasonable? In Exercise 63, you are asked to explore this question by
ﬁrst using the Internet to obtain unemployment data for years subsequent to
2000 and then comparing this new data with the values predicted by the least-
squares line.

In applications, it is sometimes necessary or useful to know whether two given lines
are parallel or perpendicular. A vertical line is parallel only to other vertical lines and
is perpendicular to any horizontal line. Cases involving nonvertical lines can be han-
dled by the following slope criteria.

tortoise and the hare from the starting line
regarded as functions of time.

FUNCTIONAL MODELS
45
SECTION 1.4
Functional Models
Practical problems in business, economics, and the physical and life sciences are often
too complicated to be precisely described by simple formulas, and one of our basic
goals is to develop mathematical methods for dealing with such problems. Toward this
end, we shall use a procedure called mathematical modeling, which may be described
in terms of four stages:
Stage 1 (Formulation): Given a real-world situation (for example, the U.S. trade
deﬁcit, the AIDS epidemic, global weather patterns), we make enough simplify-
ing assumptions to allow a mathematical formulation. This may require gather-
ing and analyzing data and using knowledge from a variety of different areas to
identify key variables and establish equations relating those variables. This for-
mulation is called a mathematical model.
Stage 2 (Analysis of the Model): We use mathematical methods to analyze or “solve”
the mathematical model. Calculus will be the primary tool of analysis in this text,
but in practice, a variety of tools, such as statistics, numerical analysis, and com-
puter science, may be brought to bear on a particular model.
Stage 3 (Interpretation): After the mathematical model has been analyzed, any con-
clusions that may be drawn from the analysis are applied to the original real-
world problem, both to gauge the accuracy of the model and to make predictions.
For instance, analysis of a model of a particular business may predict that proﬁt
will be maximized by producing 200 units of a certain commodity.
Stage 4 (Testing and Adjustment): In this ﬁnal stage, the model is tested by gath-
ering new data to check the accuracy of any predictions inferred from the analy-
sis. If the predictions are not conﬁrmed by the new evidence, the assumptions of
the model are adjusted and the modeling process is repeated. Referring to the
business example described in stage 3, it may be found that proﬁt begins to wane
at a production level signiﬁcantly less than 200 units, which would indicate that
the model requires modiﬁcation.
The four stages of mathematical modeling are displayed in Figure 1.30. In a good
model, the real-world problem is idealized just enough to allow mathematical analysis

but not so much that the essence of the underlying situation has been compromised.
For instance, if we assume that weather is strictly periodic, with rain occurring every
10 days, the resulting model would be relatively easy to analyze but would clearly
be a poor representation of reality.
In preceding sections, you have seen models representing quantities such as man-
ufacturing cost, price and demand, air pollution levels, and population size, and you
will encounter many more in subsequent chapters. Some of these models, especially
those analyzed in the Think About It essays at the end of each chapter, are more
detailed and illustrate how decisions are made about assumptions and predictions.
Constructing and analyzing mathematical models is one of the most important skills
you will learn in calculus, and the process begins with learning how to set up and
solve word problems. Examples 1.4.1 through 1.4.8 illustrate a variety of techniques
for addressing such problems.
In Examples 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 the quantity you are seeking is expressed most naturally
in terms of two variables. You will have to eliminate one of these variables before
you can write the quantity as a function of a single variable.
EXAMPLE 1.4.1
The highway department is planning to build a picnic area for motorists along a major
highway. It is to be rectangular with an area of 5,000 square yards and is to be fenced
off on the three sides not adjacent to the highway. Express the number of yards of
fencing required as a function of the length of the unfenced side.
Solution
It is natural to start by introducing two variables, say x and y, to denote the lengths
of the sides of the picnic area (Figure 1.31). Expressing the number of yards F of
required fencing in terms of these two variables, we get
Since the goal is to express the number of yards of fencing as a function of x
alone, you must ﬁnd a way to express y in terms of x. To do this, use the fact that
the area is to be 5,000 square yards and write
xy  5,000
area
Solve this equation for y
and substitute the resulting expression for y into the formula for F to get
A graph of the relevant portion of this rational function is sketched in Figure 1.32.
Notice that there is some length x for which the amount of required fencing is min-
imal. In Chapter 3, you will compute this optimal value of x using calculus.

EXAMPLE 1.4.2
A cylindrical can is to have a capacity (volume) of 24 cubic inches. The cost of the
material used for the top and bottom of the can is 3 cents per square inch, and the cost
of the material used for the curved side is 2 cents per square inch. Express the cost
of constructing the can as a function of its radius.
Solution
Let r denote the radius of the circular top and bottom, h the height of the can, and C
the cost (in cents) of constructing the can. Then,
where, for each component of cost,
The area of the circular top (or bottom) is r2, and the cost per square inch of
the top (or bottom) is 3 cents. Hence,
To ﬁnd the area of the curved side, imagine the top and bottom of the can
removed and the side cut and spread out to form a rectangle, as shown in Figure 1.33.
The height of the rectangle is the height h of the can. The length of the rectangle is
the circumference 2r of the circular top (or bottom) of the can. Hence, the area of
the rectangle (or curved side) is 2rh square inches. Since the cost of the side is
2 cents per square inch, it follows that

Since the goal is to express the cost as a function of the radius alone, you must

Let x denote the number of hundred-cubic-feet units of water used by the family dur-
ing the month and C(x) the corresponding cost in dollars. If 0  x  12, the cost is
simply the cost per unit times the number of units used:
If 12  x  24, each of the ﬁrst 12 units costs $1.22, and so the total cost of these
12 units is 1.22(12)  14.64 dollars. Each of the remaining x  12 units costs $10, and
hence the total cost of these units is 10(x  12) dollars. The cost of all x units is the sum
If x  24, the cost of the ﬁrst 12 units is 1.22(12)  14.64 dollars, the cost of
the next 12 units is 10(12)  120 dollars, and that of the remaining x  24 units is
50(x  24) dollars. The cost of all x units is the sum
Combining these three formulas, we can express the total cost as the piecewise-
deﬁned function

Here is an example from biology.
EXAMPLE 1.4.4
When environmental factors impose an upper bound on its size, population grows at
a rate that is jointly proportional to its current size and the difference between its cur-
rent size and the upper bound. Express the rate of population growth as a function of
the size of the population.
Solution
Let p denote the size of the population, R(p) the corresponding rate of population
growth, and b the upper bound placed on the population by the environment. Then
Difference between population and bound  b  p
and so
R(p)  kp(b  p)
where k is the constant of proportionality.
A graph of this factored polynomial is sketched in Figure 1.36. In Chapter 3, you
will use calculus to compute the population size for which the rate of population
growth is greatest.
Business and economic models often involve issues such as pricing, cost control, and
optimization of proﬁt. In Chapter 3, we shall examine a variety of such models. Here
is an example in which proﬁt is expressed as a function of the selling price of a par-
ticular product.
EXAMPLE 1.4.5
A manufacturer can produce printer paper at a cost of $2 per ream. The paper has
been selling for $5 per ream, and at that price, consumers have been buying 4,000
reams a month. The manufacturer is planning to raise the price of the paper and
estimates that for each $1 increase in the price, 400 fewer reams will be sold each
month.
a. Express the manufacturer’s monthly proﬁt as a function of the price at which the
reams are sold.
b. Sketch the graph of the proﬁt function. What price corresponds to maximum
proﬁt? What is the maximum proﬁt?
Solution
a. Begin by stating the desired relationship in words:
Proﬁt  (number of reams sold)(proﬁt per ream)
Since the goal is to express proﬁt as a function of price, the independent vari-
able is price and the dependent variable is proﬁt. Let p denote the price at which
each ream will be sold and let P(p) be the corresponding monthly proﬁt.

Next, express the number of reams sold in terms of the variable p. You
know that 4,000 reams are sold each month when the price is $5 and that 400
fewer will be sold each month for each $1 increase in price. Since the num-
ber of $1 increases is the difference p  5 between the new and old selling
prices, you must have
Number of reams sold  4,000  400(number of $1 increases)
 4,000  400(p  5)
 6,000  400p
The proﬁt per ream is simply the difference between the selling price p and
the cost $2. Thus,
Proﬁt per ream  p  2
and the total proﬁt is
P(p)  (number of reams sold)(proﬁt per ream)
 (6,000  400p)(p  2)
 400p2  6,800p  12,000
b. The graph of P(p) is the downward opening parabola shown in Figure 1.37. Max-
imum proﬁt will occur at the value of p that corresponds to the highest point on
the proﬁt graph. This is the vertex of the parabola, which we know occurs where
Thus, proﬁt is maximized when the manufacturer charges $8.50 for each ream,
and the maximum monthly proﬁt is
Notice that if the manufacturer tries to charge too little or too much, the pro-
duction and sale of printer paper becomes unproﬁtable. In fact, if the price is less
than $2 or greater than $15 per ream, the proﬁt function P(p) becomes negative
and the manufacturer experiences a loss. This fact is represented by the portion
of the proﬁt curve in Figure 1.37 that lies below the p axis.

Market equilibrium occurs when supply equals demand.
Recall from Section 1.1 that the demand function D(x) for a commodity relates the
number of units x that are produced to the unit price p  D(x) at which all x units
are demanded (sold) in the marketplace. Similarly, the supply function S(x) gives the
corresponding price p  S(x) at which producers are willing to supply x units to the
marketplace. Usually, as the price of a commodity increases, more units of the com-
modity will be supplied and fewer will be demanded. Likewise, as the production
level x increases, the supply price p  S(x) also increases but the demand price
p  D(x) decreases. This means that a typical supply curve is rising, while a typical
demand curve is falling, as indicated in Figure 1.38.
Market Equilibrium
The law of supply and demand says that in a competitive market environment,
supply tends to equal demand, and when this occurs, the market is said to be in
equilibrium. Thus, market equilibrium occurs precisely at the production level xe, where
S(xe)  D(xe). The corresponding unit price pe is called the equilibrium price; that is,
pe  D(xe)  S(xe)
When the market is not in equilibrium, it has a shortage when demand exceeds sup-
ply [D(x)  S(x)] and a surplus when supply exceeds demand [S(x)  D(x)]. This
terminology is illustrated in Figure 1.38 and in Example 1.4.6.
EXAMPLE 1.4.6
Market research indicates that manufacturers will supply x units of a particular com-
modity to the marketplace when the price is p  S(x) dollars per unit and that the
same number of units will be demanded (bought) by consumers when the price is

Since only positive values of the production level x are meaningful, we reject

function or the demand function. Thus,

b. The supply curve is a parabola and the demand curve is a line, as shown in
Figure 1.39. Notice that no units are supplied to the market until the price reaches
$14 per unit and that 29 units are demanded when the price is 0. For 0  x  10,
there is a market shortage since the supply curve is below the demand curve. The

Intersections of graphs arise in business in the context of break-even analysis. In a
typical situation, a manufacturer wishes to determine how many units of a certain
commodity have to be sold for total revenue to equal total cost. Suppose x denotes
the number of units manufactured and sold, and let C(x) and R(x) be the correspond-
ing total cost and total revenue, respectively. A pair of cost and revenue curves is
sketched in Figure 1.40.
Because of ﬁxed overhead costs, the total cost curve is initially higher than
the total revenue curve. Hence, at low levels of production, the manufacturer

suffers a loss. At higher levels of production, however, the total revenue curve is
the higher one and the manufacturer realizes a proﬁt. The point at which the two
curves cross is called the break-even point, because when total revenue equals
total cost, the manufacturer breaks even, experiencing neither a proﬁt nor a loss.
Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 1.4.7
A manufacturer can sell a certain product for $110 per unit. Total cost consists of a
ﬁxed overhead of $7,500 plus production costs of $60 per unit.
a. How many units must the manufacturer sell to break even?
b. What is the manufacturer’s proﬁt or loss if 100 units are sold?
c. How many units must be sold for the manufacturer to realize a profit of
$1,250?
Solution
If x is the number of units manufactured and sold, the total revenue is given by
R(x)  110x and the total cost by C(x)  7,500  60x.
a. To ﬁnd the break-even point, set R(x) equal to C(x) and solve:
110x  7,500  60x
50x  7,500
so that
x  150
It follows that the manufacturer will have to sell 150 units to break even (see
Figure 1.41).
b. The proﬁt P(x) is revenue minus cost. Hence,
P(x)  R(x)  C(x)  110x  (7,500  60x)  50x  7,500

The proﬁt from the sale of 100 units is
P(100)  50(100)  7,500
 2,500
The minus sign indicates a negative proﬁt (that is, a loss), which was expected
since 100 units is less than the break-even level of 150 units. It follows that the
manufacturer will lose $2,500 if 100 units are sold.
c. To determine the number of units that must be sold to generate a proﬁt of $1,250,
set the formula for proﬁt P(x) equal to 1,250 and solve for x. You get
P(x)  1,250
50x  7,500  1,250
50x  8,750
from which you can conclude that 175 units must be sold to generate the desired proﬁt.
Example 1.4.8 illustrates how break-even analysis can be used as a tool for deci-
sion making.
EXAMPLE 1.4.8
A certain car rental agency charges $25 plus 60 cents per mile. A second agency
charges $30 plus 50 cents per mile. Which agency offers the better deal?
Solution
The answer depends on the number of miles the car is driven. For short trips, the ﬁrst
agency charges less than the second, but for long trips, the second agency charges
less. Break-even analysis can be used to ﬁnd the number of miles for which the two
agencies charge the same.

This implies that the two agencies charge the same amount if the car is driven

to a local glass company for recycling. Since the
project began 80 days ago, the club has collected
24,000 pounds of glass for which the glass
company currently offers 1 cent per pound.
However, since bottles are accumulating faster
than they can be recycled, the company plans to
reduce by 1 cent each day the price it will pay for
100 pounds of used glass. Assuming that the club
can continue to collect bottles at the same rate
and that transportation costs make more than one
trip to the glass company infeasible, express the

Limits
As you will see in subsequent chapters, calculus is an enormously powerful branch
of mathematics with a wide range of applications, including curve sketching, opti-
mization of functions, analysis of rates of change, and computation of area and prob-
ability. What gives calculus its power and distinguishes it from algebra is the concept
of limit, and the purpose of this section is to provide an introduction to this impor-
tant concept. Our approach will be intuitive rather than formal. The ideas outlined
here form the basis for a more rigorous development of the laws and procedures of
calculus and lie at the heart of much of modern mathematics.
Roughly speaking, the limit process involves examining the behavior of a function
f(x) as x approaches a number c that may or may not be in the domain of f. Limit-
ing behavior occurs in a variety of practical situations. For instance, absolute zero,
the temperature Tc at which all molecular activity ceases, can be approached but never
actually attained in practice. Similarly, economists who speak of proﬁt under ideal
conditions or engineers proﬁling the ideal speciﬁcations of a new engine are really
dealing with limiting behavior.
To illustrate the limit process, consider a manager who determines that when x%
of her company’s plant capacity is being used, the total cost of operation is C hun-
dred thousand dollars, where
The company has a policy of rotating maintenance in an attempt to ensure that
approximately 80% of capacity is always in use. What cost should the manager
expect when the plant is operating at this ideal capacity?
It may seem that we can answer this question by simply evaluating C(80), but
attempting this evaluation results in the meaningless fraction 
However, it is still
possible to evaluate C(x) for values of x that approach 80 from the right (x  80,
when capacity is temporarily overutilized) and from the left (x  80, when capacity
is underutilized). A few such calculations are summarized in the following table.
x approaches 80 from the left →

The values of C(x) displayed on the lower line of this table suggest that C(x)
approaches the number 7 as x gets closer and closer to 80. Thus, it is reasonable
for the manager to expect a cost of $700,000 when 80% of plant capacity is
utilized.
The functional behavior in this example can be described by saying “C(x) has the
limiting value 7 as x approaches 80” or, equivalently, by writing
More generally, the limit of f(x) as x approaches the number c can be deﬁned infor-
mally as follows.

The graph of f(x) is shown in Figure 1.44. The limit computation says that the height
of the graph of y  f(x) approaches L  0.5 as x approaches 1. This corresponds to
the “hole” in the graph of f(x) at (1, 0.5). We will compute this same limit using an
algebraic procedure in Example 1.5.6.

It is important to remember that limits describe the behavior of a function near
a particular point, not necessarily at the point itself. This is illustrated in Figure 1.45.
For all three functions graphed, the limit of f(x) as x approaches 3 is equal to 4. Yet
the functions behave quite differently at x  3 itself. In Figure 1.45a, f(3) is equal to
the limit 4; in Figure 1.45b, f(3) is different from 4; and in Figure 1.45c, f(3) is not

In geometric terms, the limit statement 
says that the height of the graph 
of the constant function f(x)  k approaches k as x approaches c. Similarly, 
says that the height of the linear function f(x)  x approaches c as x approaches c.
These statements are illustrated in Figure 1.47.

In Example 1.5.4, the denominator of the given rational function approaches zero,
while the numerator does not. When this happens, you can conclude that the limit
does not exist. The absolute value of such a quotient increases without bound and
hence does not approach any ﬁnite number.
EXAMPLE 1.5.4
Find 
Solution
The quotient rule for limits does not apply in this case since the limit of the denom-
inator is
Since the limit of the numerator is 
which is not equal to zero, you 
can conclude that the limit of the quotient does not exist.
The graph of the function 
in Figure 1.48 gives you a better idea of 
what is actually happening in this example. Note that f(x) increases without bound as
x approaches 2 from the right and decreases without bound as x approaches 2 from
the left.

In Example 1.5.5, the numerator and the denominator of the given rational func-
tion both approach zero. When this happens, you should try to simplify the function
algebraically to ﬁnd the desired limit.
EXAMPLE 1.5.5
Find 
Solution
As x approaches 1, both the numerator and the denominator approach zero, and you
can draw no conclusion about the size of the quotient. To proceed, observe that the
given function is not deﬁned when x  1 but that for all other values of x, you can
cancel the common factor x  1 to obtain
(Since x  1, you are not dividing by zero.) Now take the limit as x approaches (but
is not equal to) 1 to get
The graph of the function 
is shown in Figure 1.49. Note that it 
is like the graph in Figure 1.48 with a hole at the point (1, 2).
In general, when both the numerator and denominator of a quotient approach
zero as x approaches c, your strategy will be to simplify the quotient algebraically
(as in Example 1.5.5 by canceling x  1). In most cases, the simpliﬁed form of the
quotient will be valid for all values of x except x  c. Since you are interested in
the behavior of the quotient near x  c and not at x  c, you may use the simpli-
ﬁed form of the quotient to calculate the limit. In Example 1.5.6, we use this tech-
nique to obtain the limit we estimated using a table in Example 1.5.1.
EXAMPLE 1.5.6

Solution
Both the numerator and denominator approach 0 as x approaches 1. To simplify the

Functions, Graphs, and Limits

“Long-term” behavior is often a matter of interest in business and economics or the
physical and life sciences. For example, a biologist may wish to know the population
of a bacterial colony or a population of fruit ﬂies after an indeﬁnite period of time,
or a business manager may wish to know how the average cost of producing a
particular commodity is affected as the level of production increases indeﬁnitely.
In mathematics, the inﬁnity symbol  is used to represent either unbounded
growth or the result of such growth. Here are deﬁnitions of limits involving inﬁnity
we will use to study long-term behavior.
Limits Involving
Inﬁnity
Geometrically, the limit statement 
means that as x increases 
without bound, the graph of f(x) approaches the horizontal line y  L, while
means that the graph of f(x) approaches the line y  M as x decreases
without bound. The lines y  L and y  M that appear in this context are called horizontal
asymptotes of the graph of f(x). There are many different ways for a graph to have hor-
izontal asymptotes, one of which is shown in Figure 1.50. We will have more to say about
asymptotes in Chapter 3 as part of a general discussion of graphing with calculus.

L as x increases without bound, we write

A graph illustrating limits at inﬁnity and horizontal asymptotes.
The algebraic properties of limits listed earlier in this section also apply to lim-
its at inﬁnity. In addition, since any reciprocal power 1/xk for k  0 becomes smaller
and smaller in absolute value as x either increases or decreases without bound, we
have these useful rules:
Reciprocal Power Rules

If A and k are constants with k  0 and xk is
defered for all x, then

The functional values on the bottom line in the table suggest that f(x) tends toward
0.5 as x grows larger and larger. To conﬁrm this observation analytically, we divide each
term in f(x) by the highest power that appears in the denominator 1  x  2x2; namely,
by x2. This enables us to ﬁnd 
by applying reciprocal power rules as follows:
The graph of f(x) is shown in Figure 1.51. For practice, verify that 
also.

If a crop is planted in soil where the nitrogen level is N, then the crop yield Y can
be modeled by the Michaelis-Menten function
where A and B are positive constants. What happens to crop yield as the nitrogen
level is increased indeﬁnitely?
Solution
We wish to compute
Thus, the crop yield tends toward the constant value A as the nitrogen level N
increases indeﬁnitely. For this reason, A is called the maximum attainable yield.
If the functional values f(x) increase or decrease without bound as x approaches c,
then technically 
does not exist. However, the behavior of the function in such

In essence, it is hard to eat heartily while watch-

of size S, the intake rate of food, I(S), is given by
a function of the form

SECTION 1.6
One-Sided Limits and Continuity
The dictionary deﬁnes continuity as an “unbroken or uninterrupted succession.” Con-
tinuous behavior is certainly an important part of our lives. For instance, the growth
of a tree is continuous, as are the motion of a rocket and the volume of water ﬂow-
ing into a bathtub. In this section, we shall discuss what it means for a function to
be continuous and shall examine a few important properties of such functions.
Informally, a continuous function is one whose graph can be drawn without the “pen”
leaving the paper (Figure 1.52a). Not all functions have this property, but those that
do play a special role in calculus. A function is not continuous where its graph has a
“hole or gap” (Figure 1.52b), but what do we really mean by “holes and gaps” in a
graph? To describe such features mathematically, we require the concept of a one-
sided limit of a function; that is, a limit in which the approach is either from the right
or from the left, rather than from both sides as required for the “two-sided” limit intro-
duced in Section 1.5.

For instance, Figure 1.53 shows the graph of inventory I as a function of time
t for a company that immediately restocks to level L1 whenever the inventory falls
to a certain minimum level L2 (this is called just-in-time inventory). Suppose the
ﬁrst restocking time occurs at t  t1. Then as t tends toward t1 from the left, the
limiting value of I(t) is L2, while if the approach is from the right, the limiting
value is L1.

So what properties will guarantee that f(x) does not have a “hole or gap” at 
x  c? The answer is surprisingly simple. The function must be deﬁned at x  c, it must
have a ﬁnite, two-sided limit at x  c; and 
must equal f(c). To summarize:
lim
x→c f(x)
Recall that if p(x) and q(x) are polynomials, then
and
These limit formulas can be interpreted as saying that a polynomial or a rational
function is continuous wherever it is deﬁned. This is illustrated in Examples 1.6.4
through 1.6.7.

For what value of the constant A is the following function continuous for all real x?

Since Ax  5 and x2  3x  4 are both polynomials, it follows that f(x) will be con-
tinuous everywhere except possibly at x  1. Moreover, f(x) approaches A  5 as
x approaches 1 from the left and approaches 2 as x approaches 1 from the right. Thus,
for 
to exist, we must have A  5  2 or A  3, in which case
This means that f is continuous for all x only when A  3.

Continuity on an Interval
■
A function f(x) is said to be continuous on
an open interval a  x  b if it is continuous at each point x  c in that interval.
Moreover, f is continuous on the closed interval a  x  b if it is continuous
on the open interval a  x  b and
lim
x→a f(x)  f(a)    and    lim
x→b f(x)  f(b)
In other words, continuity on an interval means that the graph of f is “one piece”
throughout the interval.

EXAMPLE 1.6.8
Discuss the continuity of the function
on the open interval 2  x  3 and on the closed interval 2  x  3.
Solution
The rational function f(x) is continuous for all x except x  3. Therefore, it is con-
tinuous on the open interval 2  x  3 but not on the closed interval 2  x  3,
since it is discontinuous at the endpoint 3 (where its denominator is zero). The graph
of f is shown in Figure 1.60.
An important feature of continuous functions is the intermediate value property, which
says that if f(x) is continuous on the interval a  x  b and L is a number between f(a)
and f(b), then f(c)  L for some number c between a and b (see Figure 1.61). In other
words, a continuous function attains all values between any two of its values. For instance,
a girl who weighs 5 pounds at birth and 100 pounds at age 12 must have weighed exactly
50 pounds at some time during her 12 years of life, since her weight is a continuous
function of time.

Solution
Let 
. Then 
Since f(x) is con-
tinuous for 1  x  2 and the graph of f is below the x axis at x  1 and above the
x axis at x  2, it follows from the intermediate value property that the graph must
cross the x axis somewhere between x  1 and x  2 (see Figure 1.62). In other
words, there is a number c such that 1  c  2 and f (c)  0, so
NOTE
The root-location procedure described in Example 1.6.9 can be applied
repeatedly to estimate the root c to any desired degree of accuracy. For instance,
the midpoint of the interval 1  x  2 is d  1.5 and f(1.5)  0.65, so the root
c must lie in the interval 1.5  x  2 (since f(2)  0), and so on.
“That’s nice,” you say, “but I can use the solve utility on my calculator to ﬁnd a
much more accurate estimate for c with much less effort.” You are right, of course,
but how do you think your calculator makes its estimation? Perhaps not by the method
just described, but certainly by some similar algorithmic procedure. It is important to
understand such procedures as you use the technology that utilizes them.

ALLOMETRIC MODELS
When developing a mathematical model, the ﬁrst task is to identify quantities of
interest, and the next is to ﬁnd equations that express relationships between these
quantities. Such equations can be quite complicated, but there are many important
relationships that can be expressed in the relatively simple form y  Cxk, in which
one quantity y is expressed as a constant multiple of a power function of another
quantity x.
In biology, the study of the relative growth rates of various parts of an organism
is called allometry, from the Greek words allo (other or different) and metry (mea-
sure). In allometric models, equations of the form y  Cxk are often used to describe
the relationship between two biological measurements. For example, the size a of the
antlers of an elk from tip to tip has been shown to be related to h, the shoulder height
of the elk, by the allometric equation
a  0.026h1.7
where a and h are both measured in centimeters (cm).* This relationship is shown in
the accompanying ﬁgure.
Whenever possible, allometric models are developed using basic assumptions
from biological (or other) principles. For example, it is reasonable to assume that the
body volume and hence the weight of most animals is proportional to the cube of the
linear dimension of the body, such as height for animals that stand up or length for
four-legged animals. Thus, it is reasonable to expect the weight of a snake to be pro-
portional to the cube of its length, and indeed, observations of the hognose snake of

Kansas indicate that the weight w (grams) and length L (meters) of a typical such
snake are related by the equation*
w  440L3
At times, observed data may be quite different from the results predicted by the
model. In such a case, we seek a better model. For the western hognose snake, it turns
out that the equations w  446L2.99 and w  429L2.90 provide better approximations
to the weight of male and female western hognose snakes, respectively. However,
there is no underlying biological reason why we should use exponents less than 3. It
just turns out these equations are slightly better ﬁts.
The basal metabolic rate M of an animal is the rate of heat produced by its body
when it is resting and fasting. Basal metabolic rates have been studied since the 1830s.
Allometric equations of the form M  cwr, for constants c and r, have long been used
to build models relating the basal metabolic rate to the body weight w of an animal.
The development of such a model is based on the assumption that basal metabolic
rate M is proportional to S, the surface area of the body, so that M  aS where a is
a constant. To set up an equation relating M and w, we need to relate the weight w
of an animal to its surface area S. Assuming that all animals are shaped like spheres
or cubes, and that the weight of an animal is proportional to its volume, we can show
(see Exercises 1 and 2) that the surface area is proportional to w2/3, so that S  bw2/3
where b is a constant. Putting the equations M  aS and S  bw2/3 together, we obtain
the allometric equation
M  abw2/3  kw2/3
where k  ab.
However, this is not the end of the story. When more reﬁned modeling assump-
tions are used, it is found that the basal metabolic rate M is better approximated if
the exponent 3/4 is used in the allometric equation rather than the exponent 2/3.
Observations further suggest that the constant 70 be used in this equation (see
M. Kleiber, The Fire of Life, An Introduction to Animal Energetics, Wiley, 1961). This
gives us the equation
M  70w3/4
where M is measured in kilocalories per day and w is measured in kilograms. Addi-
tional information about allometric models may be found in our Web Resources Guide
at www.mhhe.com/hoffmann.

SECTION 2.1
The Derivative
Calculus is the mathematics of change, and the primary tool for studying change is a
procedure called differentiation. In this section, we shall introduce this procedure and
examine some of its uses, especially in computing rates of change. Here, and later in
this chapter, we shall encounter rates such as velocity, acceleration, production rates
with respect to labor level or capital expenditure, the rate of growth of a population,
the infection rate of a susceptible population during an epidemic, and many others.
Calculus was developed in the seventeenth century by Isaac Newton (1642–1727)
and G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716) and others at least in part in an attempt to deal with
two geometric problems:
Tangent problem: Find a tangent line at a particular point on a given curve.
Area problem: Find the area of the region under a given curve.
The area problem involves a procedure called integration in which quantities such as
area, average value, present value of an income stream, and blood ﬂow rate are
computed as a special kind of limit of a sum. We shall study this procedure in Chapters
5 and 6. The tangent problem is closely related to the study of rates of change, and
we will begin our study of calculus by examining this connection.
Recall from Section 1.3 that a linear function L(x)  mx  b changes at the constant rate
m with respect to the independent variable x. That is, the rate of change of L(x) is given
by the slope or steepness of its graph, the line y  mx  b (Figure 2.1a). For a function
f(x) that is not linear, the rate of change is not constant but varies with x. In particular,
when x  c, the rate is given by the steepness of the graph of f(x) at the point P(c, f(c)),
which can be measured by the slope of the tangent line to the graph at P (Figure 2.1b).
The relationship between rate of change and slope is illustrated in Example 2.1.1.

EXAMPLE 2.1.1
The graph shown in Figure 2.2 gives the relationship between the percentage of
unemployment U and the corresponding percentage of inﬂation I. Use the graph to
estimate the rate at which I changes with respect to U when the level of unemploy-
ment is 3% and again when it is 10%.

Solution
From the ﬁgure, we estimate the slope of the tangent line at the point (3, 14), corre-
sponding to U  3, to be approximately 14. That is, when unemployment is 3%,
inﬂation I is decreasing at the rate of 14 percentage points for each percentage point
increase in unemployment U.
At the point (10, 5), the slope of the tangent line is approximately 0.4, which
means that when there is 10% unemployment, inﬂation is decreasing at the rate of
only 0.4 percentage point for each percentage point increase in unemployment.
In Example 2.1.2, we show how slope and a rate of change can be computed ana-
lytically using a limit.

EXAMPLE 2.1.2
If air resistance is neglected, an object dropped from a great height will fall
s(t)  16t2 feet in t seconds.
a. What is the object’s velocity after t  2 seconds?
b. How is the velocity found in part (a) related to the graph of s(t)?
Solution
a. The velocity after 2 seconds is the instantaneous rate of change of s(t) at t  2.
Unless the falling object has a speedometer, it is hard to simply “read” its
velocity. However, we can measure the distance it falls as time t changes by a
small amount h from t  2 to t  2  h and then compute the average rate of

Figure 2.3a shows the graph of s(t)  16t2, along with the points P(2, 64) and

graph of s(t) and has slope
As indicated in Figure 2.3b, when we take smaller and smaller values of h,
the corresponding secant lines PQ tend toward the position of what we intuitively
think of as the tangent line to the graph of s(t) at P. This suggests that we can
compute the slope mtan of the tangent line by ﬁnding the limiting value of msec
as h tends toward 0; that is,
Thus, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of s(t)  16t2 at the point where

The Derivative of a Function
■
The derivative of the function f(x) with
respect to x is the function f(x) given by
[read f(x) as “f prime of x”]. The process of computing the derivative is called
differentiation, and we say that f(x) is differentiable at x  c if f(c) exists; that
is, if the limit that deﬁnes f(x) exists when x  c.

We then compute the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at x  c by ﬁnding the
limiting value of the average rate as h tends to 0; that is,
This limit also gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve y  f(x) at the point
P(c, f(c)), as indicated in Figure 2.4b.
The expression
is called a difference quotient for the function f(x), and we have just seen that rates of
change and slope can both be computed by ﬁnding the limit of an appropriate difference
quotient as h tends to 0. To unify the study of these and other applications that involve
taking the limit of a difference quotient, we introduce this terminology and notation.

NOTE
We use “h” to increment the independent variable in difference quotients
to simplify algebraic computations. However, when it is important to emphasize
that, say, the variable x is being incremented, we will denote the increment by x
(read as “delta x”). Similarly, t and s denote small (incremental) changes in the
variables t and s, respectively. This notation is used extensively in Section 2.5.

EXAMPLE 2.1.3
Find the derivative of the function f(x)  16x2.
Solution
The difference quotient for f(x) is
Thus, the derivative of f(x)  16x2 is the function
 32x
Once we have computed the derivative of a function f(x), it can be used to
streamline any computation involving the limit of the difference quotient of f(x) as h
tends to 0. For instance, notice that the function in Example 2.1.3 is essentially the same
as the distance function s  16t2 that appears in the falling body problem in Example
2.1.1. Using the result of Example 2.1.3, the velocity of the falling body at time t  2
can now be found by simply substituting t  2 into the formula for the derivative s(t):
Velocity  s(2)  32(2)  64
Likewise, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of s(t) at the point P(2, 64) is
given by
Slope  s(2)  64

gent line to the curve y  x3 at the point where x  1. What is the equation of the

Solution
According to the deﬁnition of the derivative
Thus, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y  x3 at the point where x  1
is f(1)  3(1)2  3 (Figure 2.5). To ﬁnd an equation for the tangent line, we also
need the y coordinate of the point of tangency; namely, y  (1)3  1. Therefore,
the tangent line passes through the point (1, 1) with slope 3. By applying the
point-slope formula, we obtain the equation

to the proﬁt curve y  P(x) is sloped downward at the point Q where x  9, as shown
in Figure 2.6. Since the tangent line at Q is sloped downward, the proﬁt curve must
be falling at Q, so proﬁt must be decreasing when 9,000 units are being produced.
The signiﬁcance of the sign of the derivative is summarized in the following box
and in Figure 2.7. We will have much more to say about the relationship between the
shape of a curve and the sign of derivatives in Chapter 3, where we develop a gen-
eral procedure for curve sketching.
Signiﬁcance of the Sign of the Derivative f(x).
■
If the function f
is differentiable at x  c, then
f is increasing at x  c if f(c)  0
and
f is decreasing at x  c if f(c)  0
Thus, when the level of production is x  9 (9,000 units), the proﬁt is changing at
the rate of
P(9)  800(9)  6,800  400
dollars per thousand units.

The derivative f(x) of y  f(x) is sometimes written as 
or 
(read as “dee y, dee
x” or “dee f, dee x”). In this notation, the value of the derivative at x  c [that is,
f(c)] is written as
For example, if y  x2, then
and the value of this derivative at x  3 is
The 
notation for derivative suggests slope, 
and can also be thought of as
“the rate of change of y with respect to x.” Sometimes it is convenient to condense
a statement such as
“when y  x2, then 
”
by writing simply
which reads, “the derivative of x2 with respect to x is 2x.”
Example 2.1.6 illustrates how the different notational forms for the derivative can
be used.

Notice that the function

its derivative do not always have the same domain.
■
If a function f(x) is differentiable where x  c, then the graph of y  f(x) has a non-
vertical tangent line at the point P(c, f(c)) and at all points on the graph that are
“near” P. We would expect such a function to be continuous at x  c since a graph
with a tangent line at the point P certainly cannot have a “hole” or “gap” at P. To
summarize:
Veriﬁcation of this observation is outlined in Exercise 62. Notice that we are
not claiming that a continuous function must be differentiable. Indeed it can be
shown that a continuous function f(x) will not be differentiable at x  c if f (x)
becomes inﬁnite at x  c or if the graph of f(x) has a “sharp” point at P(c, f(c));
that is, a point where the curve makes an abrupt change in direction. If f(x) is con-
tinuous at x  c but f (c) is inﬁnite, the graph of f may have a “vertical tangent”
at the point P(c, f(c)) (Figure 2.8a) or a “cusp” at P (Figure 2.8b). The absolute
value function f(x)  x is continuous for all x but has a “sharp point” at the ori-
gin (0, 0) (see Figure 2.8c and Exercise 61). Another graph with a “sharp point” is
shown in Figure 2.8d.

In general, the functions you encounter in this text will be differentiable at almost
all points. In particular, polynomials are everywhere differentiable and rational func-
tions are differentiable wherever they are deﬁned.
An example of a practical situation involving a continuous function that is not
always differentiable is provided by the circulation of blood in the human body.* It
is tempting to think of blood coursing smoothly through the veins and arteries in a
constant ﬂow, but in actuality, blood is ejected by the heart into the arteries in dis-
crete bursts. This results in an arterial pulse, which can be used to measure the heart
rate by applying pressure to an accessible artery, as at the wrist. A blood pressure
curve showing a pulse is sketched in Figure 2.9. Notice how the curve quickly changes
direction at the minimum (diastolic) pressure, as a burst of blood is injected by the
heart into the arteries, causing the blood pressure to rise rapidly until the maximum
(systolic) pressure is reached, after which the pressure gradually declines as blood is
distributed to tissue by the arteries. The blood pressure function is continuous but is
not differentiable at t  0.75 seconds where the infusion of blood occurs.

SECTION 2.2
Techniques of Differentiation
If we had to use the limit deﬁnition every time we wanted to compute a derivative, it
would be both tedious and difﬁcult to use calculus in applications. Fortunately, this is not
necessary, and in this section and Section 2.3, we develop techniques that greatly sim-
plify the process of differentiation. We begin with a rule for the derivative of a constant.
You can see this by considering the graph of a constant function f(x)  c, which
is a horizontal line (see Figure 2.10). Since the slope of such a line is 0 at all its
points, it follows that f(x)  0. Here is a proof using the limit deﬁnition:
EXAMPLE 2.2.1
The next rule is one of the most useful because it tells you how to take the deriv-
ative of any power function f(x)  xn. Note that the rule applies not only to functions
like f(x)  x5 but also to those such as 
and 
Functions such as 
can also be differentiated using the power rule, but we do not
deﬁne what is meant by such functions until Chapter 4.

A general proof for the power rule in the case where n is a positive integer is out-
lined in Exercise 78. The case where n is a negative integer and the case where n is
a rational number (n = r/s for integers r and s with s  0) are outlined in exercises
in Section 2.3 and Section 2.6, respectively.
The constant rule and power rule provide simple formulas for ﬁnding derivatives
of a class of important functions, but to differentiate more complicated expressions,
we need to know how to manipulate derivatives algebraically. The next two rules tell
us that derivatives of multiples and sums of functions are multiples and sums of the
corresponding derivatives.

a. At what rate will the population be changing with respect to time 15 months from
now?
b. By how much will the population actually change during the 16th month?
Solution
a. The rate of change of the population with respect to time is the derivative of the
population function. That is,
Rate of change  P(x)  2x  20
The rate of change of the population 15 months from now will be
P(15)  2(15)  20  50 people per month
b. The actual change in the population during the 16th month is the difference
between the population at the end of 16 months and the population at the end of
15 months. That is,
Change in population  P(16)  P(15)  8,576  8,525
 51 people
NOTE
In Example 2.2.6, the actual change in population during the 16th month
in part (b) differs from the monthly rate of change at the beginning of the month
in part (a) because the rate varies during the month. The instantaneous rate in
part (a) can be thought of as the change in population that would occur during
the 16th month if the rate of change of population were to remain constant.
■
In many practical situations, the rate of change of a quantity Q is not as signiﬁcant
as its relative rate of change, which is deﬁned as the ratio

lation is 5 million yields a negligible relative (per capita) rate of change of

rate of change of

Since the rate of change of a quantity Q(x) is measured by the derivative Q(x),
we can express the relative rate of change and the associated percentage rate of change

Solution
The percentage rate of change of Q(t) is
Notice that the percentage rate decreases as Q increases and becomes zero when
Q  a. If Q  a, the percentage rate is negative, which means the biomass is actu-
ally decreasing.
Motion of an object along a line is called rectilinear motion. For example, the motion
of a rocket early in its ﬂight can be regarded as rectilinear. When studying rectilinear
motion, we will assume that the object involved is moving along a coordinate axis.
If the function s(t) gives the position of the object at time t, then the rate of change
of s(t) with respect to t is its velocity v(t) and the time derivative of velocity is its
acceleration a(t). That is, v(t)  s(t) and a(t)  v(t).

The object is said to be advancing (moving forward) when v(t)  0, and retreat-
ing (moving backward) when v(t)  0. When v(t)  0, the object is neither advanc-
ing nor retreating and is said to be stationary. See Figure 2.11. Finally, the object is
accelerating when a(t)  0 and decelerating when a(t)  0. To summarize:
Rectilinear Motion
■
If the position at time t of an object moving along a
straight line is given by s(t), then the object has
velocity
and
acceleration
The object is advancing when v(t)  0, retreating when v(t)  0, and station-
ary when v(t)  0. It is accelerating when a(t)  0 and decelerating when
a(t)  0.

If position is measured in meters and time in seconds, velocity is measured in
meters per second (m/sec) and acceleration in meters per second per second (written
as m/sec2). Similarly, if position is measured in feet, velocity is measured in feet per
second (ft/sec) and acceleration in feet per second per second (ft/sec2).

The object will be accelerating [a(t)  0] when 2  t  4 and decelerating

NOTE
An accelerating object is not necessarily “speeding up,” nor is a decel-
erating object always “slowing down.” For instance, the object in Example 2.2.9
has negative velocity and is accelerating for 2  t  3. This means that the veloc-
ity is increasing over this time period; that is, becoming less negative. In other
words, the object is actually slowing down.
■
An important example of rectilinear motion is the motion of a projectile. Suppose an
object is projected (e.g., thrown, ﬁred, or dropped) vertically in such a way that the
only acceleration acting on the object is the constant downward acceleration g due to
gravity. Near sea level, g is approximately 32 ft/sec2 (or 9.8 m/sec2). It can be shown
that at time t, the height of the object is given by the formula

The motion of a ball thrown upward from the top of a building.
where H0 and V0 are the initial height and velocity of the object, respectively. Here
is an example using this formula.
EXAMPLE 2.2.10
Suppose a person standing at the top of a building 112 feet high throws a ball verti-
cally upward with an initial velocity of 96 ft/sec (see Figure 2.13).
a. Find the ball’s height and velocity at time t.
b. When does the ball hit the ground and what is its impact velocity?
c. When is the velocity 0? What is the signiﬁcance of this time?
d. How far does the ball travel during its ﬂight?
Solution
a. Since g  32, V0  96, and H0  112, the height of the ball above the ground at
time t is
H(t)  16t2  96t  112 feet
The velocity at time t is
b. The ball hits the ground when H  0. Solve the equation 16t2  96t  112  0
to ﬁnd that this occurs when t  7 and t  1 (verify). Disregarding the nega-
tive time t  1, which is not meaningful in this context, conclude that impact
occurs when t  7 seconds and that the impact velocity is
v(7)  32(7)  96  128 ft/sec
(The negative sign means the ball is coming down at the moment of impact.)
c. The velocity is zero when v(t)  32t  96  0, which occurs when t  3 seconds.
For t  3, the velocity is positive and the ball is rising, and for t  3, the ball is
falling (see Figure 2.13). Thus, the ball is at its highest point when t  3 seconds.
d. The ball starts at H(0)  112 feet and rises to a maximum height of H(3)  256
feet before falling to the ground. Thus,

79. POLLUTION CONTROL
It has been suggested
that one way to reduce worldwide carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions is to impose a single tax that
would apply to all nations. The accompanying
graph shows the relationship between different
levels of the carbon tax and the percentage of
reduction in CO2 emissions.
a. What tax rate would have to be imposed to
achieve a worldwide reduction of 50% in CO2
emissions?
b. Use the graph to estimate the rate of change of
the percentage reduction in CO2 emissions when
the tax rate is $200 per ton.
c.

paragraph on how public policy can be used to
control air pollution.*

The Product Rule
■
If f(x) and g(x) are differentiable at x, then so is their
product P(x)  f(x)g(x) and
or equivalently,
( fg)  fg  g f 
In words, the derivative of the product fg is f times the derivative of g plus g times
the derivative of f.

SECTION 2.3
Product and Quotient Rules; 
Higher-Order Derivatives
Based on your experience with the multiple and sum rules in Section 2.2, you may
think that the derivative of a product of functions is the product of separate deriva-
tives, but it is easy to see that this conjecture is false. For instance, if f(x)  x2 and
g(x)  x3, then f (x)  2x and g(x)  3x2, so
f (x)g(x)  (2x)(3x2)  6x3
while f(x)g(x)  x2x3  x5 and
[ f(x)g(x)]  (x5)  5x4
The correct formula for differentiating a product can be stated as follows.
*You may wish to begin your research by reading Chapter 12,
“Incentive-Based Strategies: Emission Taxes and Subsidies,” and

1994.

Applying the product rule to our introductory example, we ﬁnd that
(x2x3)  x2(x3)  (x3)(x2)
 (x2)(3x2)  (x3)(2x)  3x4  2x4  5x4

b. When x  1, the corresponding y value is
y(1)  [2(1)  1][2(1)2  1  1]  0
so the point of tangency is (1, 0). The slope at

EXAMPLE 2.3.3
A manufacturer determines that t months after a new product is introduced to the
market, x(t)  t2  3t hundred units can be produced and then sold at a price of
p(t)  2t3/2  30 dollars per unit.
a. Express the revenue R(t) for this product as a function of time.
b. At what rate is revenue changing with respect to time after 4 months? Is revenue
increasing or decreasing at this time?
Solution
a. The revenue is given by
R(t)  x(t)p(t)  (t2  3t)(2t3/2  30)
hundred dollars.
b. The rate of change of revenue R(t) with respect to time is given by the deriva-
tive R(t), which we ﬁnd using the product rule:
At time t  4, the revenue is changing at the rate
R(4)  [(4)2  3(4)][3(4)1/2]  [2(4)3/2  30][2(4)  3]
 14
Thus, after 4 months, the revenue is changing at the rate of 14 hundred dollars
($1,400) per month. It is decreasing at that time since R(4) is negative.
A proof of the product rule is given at the end of this section. It is also impor-
tant to be able to differentiate quotients of functions, and for this purpose, we have

NOTE
The quotient rule is probably the most complicated formula you have
had to learn so far in this book. It may help to note that the quotient rule resem-
bles the product rule except it contains a minus sign, which makes the order of
terms in the numerator very important. Begin by squaring the denominator g, and
then, while still thinking of g, copy it into the numerator. This gets you started
with the proper order in the numerator, and you can easily write down the rest
while thinking of the product rule. Don’t forget to insert the minus sign, without
which the quotient rule would not have been so hard to remember in the ﬁrst place.
This whimsical version of the quotient rule may help you remember its form:

EXAMPLE 2.3.5
A biologist models the effect of introducing a toxin to a bacterial colony by the
function
where P is the population of the colony (in millions) t hours after the toxin is introduced.
a. At what rate is the population changing when the toxin is introduced? Is the pop-
ulation increasing or decreasing at this time?
b. At what time does the population begin to decrease? By how much does the pop-
ulation increase before it begins to decline?
Solution
a. The rate of change of the population with respect to time is given by the deriv-
ative P(t), which we compute using the quotient rule:
The toxin is introduced when t  0, and at that time the population is changing
at the rate
That is, the population is initially changing at the rate of 0.1875 million (187,500)
bacteria per hour, and it is increasing since P(0)  0.
b. The population is decreasing when P(t)  0. Since the numerator of P(t) can
be factored as
t2  2t  3  (t2  2t  3)  (t  1)(t  3)
we can write
The denominator (t2  t  4)2 and the factor t  3 are both positive for all t 
 0,
which means that
for 0 	 t  1
P(t)  0 and P(t) is increasing
for t  1
P(t)  0 and P(t) is decreasing
Thus, the population begins to decline after 1 hour.

million, and after 1 hour, the population is

The quotient rule is somewhat cumbersome, so don’t use it unnecessarily. Con-
sider Example 2.3.6.
EXAMPLE 2.3.6
Differentiate the function 
Solution
Don’t use the quotient rule! Instead, rewrite the function as
and then apply the power rule term by term to get
In applications, it may be necessary to compute the rate of change of a function that
is itself a rate of change. For example, the acceleration of a car is the rate of change
with respect to time of its velocity, which in turn is the rate of change with respect
to time of its position. If the position is measured in miles and time in hours, the
velocity (rate of change of position) is measured in miles per hour, and the acceler-
ation (rate of change of velocity) is measured in miles per hour, per hour.
Statements about the rate of change of a rate of change are used frequently in eco-
nomics. In inﬂationary times, for example, you may hear a government economist assure
the nation that although inﬂation is increasing, it is doing so at a decreasing rate. That
is, prices are still going up, but not as quickly as they were before.
The rate of change of the function f(x) with respect to x is the derivative f(x),
and likewise, the rate of change of the function f(x) with respect to x is its derivative
( f (x)). This notation is awkward, so we write the derivative of the derivative of f(x)
as ( f (x))  f (x) and refer to it as the second derivative of f(x) (read f (x) as “f dou-
ble prime of x”). If y  f(x), then the second derivative of y with respect to x is written 
as y or as

NOTE
Before computing the second derivative of a function, always take time
to simplify the ﬁrst derivative as much as possible. The more complicated the form
of the ﬁrst derivative, the more tedious the computation of the second derivative.
The second derivative will be used in Section 3.2 to obtain information about the
shape of a graph, and in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 in optimization problems. Here is a

Recall from Section 2.2 that the acceleration a(t) of an object moving along a
straight line is the derivative of the velocity v(t), which in turn is the derivative of
the position function s(t). Thus, the acceleration may be thought of as the second

SECTION 2.4
The Chain Rule
In many practical situations, the rate at which one quantity is changing can
be expressed as the product of other rates. For example, suppose a car is traveling at
50 miles/hour at a particular time when gasoline is being consumed at the rate of
0.1 gal/mile. Then, to ﬁnd out how much gasoline is being used each hour, you would
multiply the rates:
(0.1 gal/mile)(50 miles/hour)  5 gal/hour
Or, suppose the total manufacturing cost at a certain factory is a function of the
number of units produced, which in turn is a function of the number of hours the

factory has been operating. If C, q, and t denote the cost, units produced, and time,
respectively, then
and
The product of these two rates is the rate of change of cost with respect to time; that is,

The Chain Rule
■
If y  f(u) is a differentiable function of u and u  g(x)
is in turn a differentiable function of x, then the composite function y  f(g(x))
is a differentiable function of x whose derivative is given by the product 
or, equivalently, by

One way to remember the chain rule is to pretend the derivatives

To illustrate the use of the chain rule, suppose you wish to differentiate the func-
tion y  (3x  1)2. Your ﬁrst instinct may be to “guess” that the derivative is
But this guess cannot be correct since expanding (3x  1)2 and differentiating each
term yields
which is 3 times our “guess” of 6x  2. However, if you write y  (3x  1)2 as

and the chain rule tells you that
which coincides with the correct answer found earlier by expanding (3x  1)2. Exam-
ples 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 illustrate various ways of using the chain rule.
EXAMPLE 2.4.1
Find 
if y  (x2  2)3  3(x2  2)2  1.
Solution
Note that y  u3  3u2  1, where u  x2  2. Thus,
and according to the chain rule,
In Sections 2.1 through 2.3, you have seen several applications (e.g., slope, rates
of change) that require the evaluation of a derivative at a particular value of the inde-
pendent variable. There are two basic ways of doing this when the derivative is com-
puted using the chain rule.
For instance, suppose in Example 2.4.1 we wish to evaluate 
when x  1.
One way to proceed would be to ﬁrst express the derivative in terms of x alone by
substituting x2  2 for u as follows:
replace u with x2  2
 6x(x2  2)[(x2  2)  2]
factor out 6x(x2  2)
 6x(x2  2)(x2)
combine terms in the brackets
 6x3(x2  2)
Then, substituting x  1 into this expression, we would get
Alternatively, we could compute u(1)  (1)2  2  3 and then substitute directly 
into the formula 
 (3u2  6u)(2x) to obtain
 [3(3)2  6(3)][2(1)]  (9)(2)  18
Both methods yield the correct result, but since it is easier to substitute numbers
than algebraic expressions, the second (numerical) method is often preferable, unless

SECTION 2.4 THE CHAIN RULE

for some reason you need to have the derivative function 
expressed in terms of x
alone. In Example 2.4.2, the numerical method for evaluating a derivative computed
with the chain rule is used to ﬁnd the slope of a tangent line.
EXAMPLE 2.4.2
Consider the function 
where u  3x2  1.
a. Use the chain rule to ﬁnd 
b. Find an equation for the tangent line to the graph of y(x) at the point where x  1.
Solution
a. We ﬁnd that
quotient rule
and
According to the chain rule, it follows that
b. To ﬁnd an equation for the tangent line to the graph of y(x) at x  1, we need to
know the value of y and the slope at the point of tangency. Since
u(1)  3(1)2  1  2
the value of y when x  1 is
substitute u(1)  2 for u
and the slope is
Therefore, by applying the point-slope formula for the equation of a line, we ﬁnd
that the tangent line to the graph of y(x) at the point where x  1 has the equation
or, equivalently, 
In many practical problems, a quantity is given as a function of one variable,
which, in turn, can be written as a function of a second variable, and the goal is to
ﬁnd the rate of change of the original quantity with respect to the second variable.
Such problems can be solved by means of the chain rule. Here is an example.

EXAMPLE 2.4.3
The cost of producing x units of a particular commodity is 
dollars, and the production level t hours into a particular production run is
x(t)  0.2t2  0.03t units. At what rate is cost changing with respect to time after
4 hours?
Solution
We ﬁnd that
so according to the chain rule,
When t  4, the level of production is
x(4)  0.2(4)2  0.03(4)  3.32 units
and by substituting 
and 
into the formula for 
, we get
Thus, after 4 hours, cost is increasing at the rate of approximately $10.13 per hour.
Sometimes when dealing with a composite function y  f(g(x)) it may help to
think of f as the “outer” function and g as the “inner” function, as indicated here:
“outer” function
y  f (g(x))
“inner” function
Then the chain rule
says that the derivative of y  f(g(x)) with respect to x is given by the derivative of the
outer function evaluated at the inner function times the derivative of the inner function.
In Example 2.4.4, we emphasize this interpretation by using a “box” (□) to indicate
the location and role of the inner function in computing a derivative with the chain rule.

Marginal Analysis and Approximations 
Using Increments
Calculus is an important tool in economics. We brieﬂy discussed sales and produc-
tion in Chapter 1, where we introduced economic concepts such as cost, revenue,
proﬁt and supply, demand, and market equilibrium. In this section, we will use the
derivative to explore rates of change involving economic quantities.
In economics,* the use of the derivative to approximate the change in a quantity that
results from a 1-unit increase in production is called marginal analysis. For instance,
suppose C(x) is the total cost of producing x units of a particular commodity. If x0
units are currently being produced, then the derivative
is called the marginal cost of producing x0 units. The limiting value that deﬁnes this
derivative is approximately equal to the difference quotient of C(x) when h  1; that is,
where the symbol  is used to indicate that this is an approximation, not an equality.
But C(x0  1)  C(x0) is just the cost of increasing the level of production by one
unit, from x0 to x0  1. To summarize:
Marginal Cost
■
If C(x) is the total cost of producing x units of a com-
modity, then the marginal cost of producing x0 units is the derivative C(x0),
which approximates the additional cost C(x0  1)  C(x0) incurred when the level
of production is increased by 1 unit, from x0 to x0  1.

Marginal Analysis
*Economists and business managers view the topics we are about to discuss from a slightly different
perspective. A good source for the economist’s view is the text by J. M. Henderson and R. E. Quandt,
Microeconomic Theory, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1986. The viewpoint of business management may be
found in D. Salvatore, Management Economics, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1989, which is an excellent
source of practical applications and case studies.

Marginal Revenue and Marginal Proﬁt
■
Suppose R(x) is the revenue
generated when x units of a particular commodity are produced, and P(x) is the
corresponding proﬁt. When x  x0 units are being produced, then:
The marginal revenue is R(x0). It approximates R(x0  1)  R(x0), the
additional revenue generated by producing one more unit.
The marginal proﬁt is P(x0). It approximates P(x0  1)  P(x0), the
additional proﬁt obtained by producing one more unit.
The preceding discussion applies not only to cost, but also to other economic
quantities. Here is a summary of what is meant by marginal revenue and marginal
proﬁt and how these marginal quantities can be used to estimate 1-unit changes in
revenue and proﬁt.
Marginal analysis is illustrated in Example 2.5.1.
EXAMPLE 2.5.1
A manufacturer estimates that when x units of a particular commodity are produced, 
the total cost will be C(x) 
 3x  98 dollars, and furthermore, that all x units
will be sold when the price is p(x)  (75  x) dollars per unit.
a. Find the marginal cost and the marginal revenue.
b. Use marginal cost to estimate the cost of producing the ninth unit.
c. What is the actual cost of producing the ninth unit?

unit.

Solution
a. The marginal cost is C(x) 

sold at a price of p(x) 

R(x)  (number of units sold)(price per unit) 
The marginal revenue is
b. The cost of producing the ninth unit is the change in cost as x increases from
8 to 9 and can be estimated by the marginal cost
c. The actual cost of producing the ninth unit is
C(9)  C(8)  $5.13
which is reasonably well approximated by the marginal cost C(8)  $5.
d. The revenue obtained from the sale of the ninth unit is approximated by the mar-
ginal revenue
e. The actual revenue obtained from the sale of the ninth unit is 
R(9)  R(8)  $19.33

Solution
a. The marginal proﬁt is given by the derivative
P(x)  0.0035(3x2)  0.07(2x)  25
 0.0105x2  0.14x  25
b. The marginal proﬁt at x  10, 50, and 80 is
P(10)  0.0105(10)2  0.14(10)  25  25.35
P(50)  0.0105(50)2  0.14(50)  25  5.75
P(80)  0.0105(80)2  0.14(80)  25  31
c. The fact that P(10)  25.35 means that a 1-unit increase in production from 10
to 11 hundred cameras increases proﬁt by approximately 25.35 thousand dollars
($25,350), so the manager may be inclined to increase production at this level.
However, since P(50)  5.75, increasing the level of production from 50 units
to 51 increases the proﬁt by only about $5,750, thus providing relatively little
incentive for the manager to make a change. Finally, since P(80)  31 is
negative, the proﬁt will actually decrease by approximately $31,000 if the pro-
duction level is raised from 80 to 81 units. The manager may wish to consider
decreasing the level of production in this case.
Marginal analysis is an important example of a general approximation procedure
based on the fact that since
then for small h, the derivative f(x0) is approximately equal to the difference quotient
We indicate this approximation by writing
or, equivalently,
To emphasize that the incremental change is in the variable x, we write h  x (read
x as “delta x”) and summarize the incremental approximation formula as follows.
Here is an example of how this approximation formula can be used in economics.

is a small change in x, then

EXAMPLE 2.5.3
Suppose the total cost in dollars of manufacturing q units of a certain commodity is
C(q)  3q2  5q  10. If the current level of production is 40 units, estimate how the
total cost will change if 40.5 units are produced.
Solution
In this problem, the current value of production is q  40 and the change in pro-
duction is q  0.5. By the approximation formula, the corresponding change in
cost is
C  C(40.5)  C(40)  C(40)q  C(40)(0.5)
Since
C(q)  6q  5
and
C(40)  6(40)  5  245
it follows that
C  [C(40)](0.5)  245(0.5)  $122.50
For practice, compute the actual change in cost caused by the increase in the level
of production from 40 to 40.5 and compare your answer with the approximation. Is
the approximation a good one?
Suppose you wish to compute a quantity Q using a formula Q(x). If the value of
x used in the computation is not precise, then its inaccuracy is passed on or propa-
gated to the computed value of Q. Example 2.5.4 shows how such propagated error
can be estimated.
EXAMPLE 2.5.4
During a medical procedure, the size of a roughly spherical tumor is estimated by 
measuring its diameter and using the formula 
to compute its volume. If 
the diameter is measured as 2.5 cm with a maximum error of 2%, how accurate is
the volume measurement?
Solution
A sphere of radius R and diameter x  2R has volume
so, the volume using the estimated diameter x  2.5 cm is

Observe the results for X  2.5.
Now perform similar

The measurement of the diameter can be off by as much as 2%; that is, by as much
as 0.02(2.5)  0.05 cm in either direction. Hence, the maximum error in the mea-
surement of the diameter is x  0.05, and the corresponding maximum error in
the calculation of volume is
Maximum error in volume  V  [V(2.5)](0.05)
Since
it follows that
Maximum error in volume  (9.817)(0.05)  0.491 
Thus, at worst, the calculation of the volume as 8.181 cm3 is off by 0.491 cm3, so
the actual volume V must satisfy

In Example 2.5.5, the desired change in the function is given, and the goal is to
estimate the necessary corresponding change in the variable.

The daily output at a certain factory is Q(L)  900L1/3 units, where L denotes the size
of the labor force measured in worker-hours. Currently, 1,000 worker-hours of labor
are used each day. Use calculus to estimate the number of additional worker-hours of

A geometric interpretation of the approximation of y by the differential dy is
shown in Figure 2.15. Note that since the slope of the tangent line at P(x, f(x)) is
f (x), the differential dy  f (x) dx is the change in the height of the tangent that cor-
responds to a change from x to x  x. On the other hand, y is the change in the
height of the curve corresponding to this change in x. Hence, approximating y by
the differential dy is the same as approximating the change in the height of a curve
by the change in height of the tangent line. If x is small, it is reasonable to expect
this to be a good approximation.

Newton’s Method
■
Tangent line approxima-
tions can be used in a variety of ways. Newton’s method
for approximating the roots of an equation f(x)  0 is
based on the idea that if we start with a “guess” x0 that
is close to an actual root c, we can often obtain an
improved estimate by ﬁnding the x intercept x1 of the
tangent line to the curve y  f(x) at x  x0 (see the
ﬁgure). The process can then be repeated until a desired
degree of accuracy is attained. In practice, it is usually
easier and faster to use the graphing utility, ZOOM and
TRACE features of your graphing utility to ﬁnd roots,
but the ideas behind Newton’s method are still impor-
tant. Exercises 33 through 37 involve Newton’s method.

Implicit Differentiation and Related Rates
The functions you have worked with so far have all been given by equations of the
form y  f(x) in which the dependent variable y on the left is given explicitly by an
expression on the right involving the independent variable x. A function in this form
is said to be in explicit form. For example, the functions
are all functions in explicit form.
Sometimes practical problems will lead to equations in which the function y is not
written explicitly in terms of the independent variable x; for example, equations such as
Since it has not been solved for y, such an equation is said to deﬁne y implicitly as
a function of x and the function y is said to be in implicit form.
Suppose you have an equation that deﬁnes y implicitly as a function of x and you
want to ﬁnd the derivative 
. For instance, you may be interested in the slope of a
line that is tangent to the graph of the equation at a particular point. One approach might
be to solve the equation for y explicitly and then differentiate using the techniques you
already know. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to ﬁnd y explicitly. For example,
there is no obvious way to solve for y in the equation x2y  2y3  3x  2y.

Moreover, even when you can solve for y explicitly, the resulting formula is often
complicated and unpleasant to differentiate. For example, the equation x2y3  6 
5y3  x can be solved for y to give
The computation of 
for this function in explicit form would be tedious, involving
both the chain rule and the quotient rule. Fortunately, there is a simple technique based
on the chain rule that you can use to ﬁnd 
without ﬁrst solving for y explicitly. This
technique, known as implicit differentiation, consists of differentiating both sides of
the given (deﬁning) equation with respect to x and then solving algebraically for 
Here is an example illustrating the technique.
EXAMPLE 2.6.1
Find 
if x2y  y2  x3.
Solution
You are going to differentiate both sides of the given equation with respect to x. So
that you won’t forget that y is actually a function of x, temporarily replace y by f(x)
and begin by rewriting the equation as
x2f(x)  ( f(x))2  x3
Now differentiate both sides of this equation term by term with respect to x:

EXAMPLE 2.6.3
Find all points on the graph of the equation x 2  y2  2x  4y where the tangent line
is horizontal. Does the graph have any vertical tangents?
Solution
Differentiate both sides of the given equation with respect to x to get
There will be a horizontal tangent at each point on the graph where the slope is zero;
that is, where the numerator 2x  2 of 
is zero:
To ﬁnd the corresponding value of y, substitute x  1 into the given equation and
solve using the quadratic formula (or your calculator):
Thus, the given graph has horizontal tangents at the points (1, 0.27) and (1, 3.73).
Since the slope of a vertical line is undeﬁned, the given graph can have a ver-
tical tangent only where the denominator 4  2y of 
is zero:
To ﬁnd the corresponding value of x, substitute y  2 into the given equation:
But this quadratic equation has no real solutions, which, in turn, implies that the given
graph has no vertical tangents. The graph is shown in Figure 2.17.
Implicit differentiation is used in economics in both practical and theoretical work. In
Section 4.3, it will be used to derive certain theoretical relationships. A more practical
application of implicit differentiation is given in Example 2.6.4, which is a preview of
the discussion of level curves of a function of two variables given in Section 7.1.

SECTION 2.6 IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION AND RELATED RATES
171
Use calculus to estimate the change in unskilled labor y that should be made to offset a
1-hour increase in skilled labor x so that output will be maintained at its current level.
Solution
The current level of output is the value of Q when x  30 and y  20. That is,
Q  2(30)3  (30)2(20)  (20)3  80,000 units
If output is to be maintained at this level, the relationship between skilled labor x and
unskilled labor y is given by the equation
80,000  2x 3  x2y  y3
which deﬁnes y implicitly as a function of x.
The goal is to estimate the change in y that corresponds to a 1-unit increase in x
when x and y are related by this equation. As you saw in Section 2.5, the change in
y caused by a 1-unit increase in x can be approximated by the derivative 
. To ﬁnd
this derivative, use implicit differentiation. (Remember that the derivative of the con-
stant 80,000 on the left-hand side is zero.)
Now evaluate this derivative when x  30 and y  20 to conclude that
That is, to maintain the current level of output, unskilled labor should be decreased
by approximately 3.14 hours to offset a 1-hour increase in skilled labor.
NOTE
In general, if Q(x, y) gives the production corresponding to x units of
one input and y units of another, then an equation of the form Q(x, y)  C for
constant C is called an isoquant. Such equations are used by economists to
explore the different combinations of inputs x and y that result in the same level 
of production. In this context, the rate 
often found by implicit differentiation 
as in Example 2.6.4, is called the marginal rate of technical substitution
(MRTS).
■
In certain practical problems, x and y are related by an equation and can be regarded
as functions of a third variable t, which often represents time. Then implicit differ-
entiation can be used to relate 
to 
. This kind of problem is said to involve related
rates. Here is a general procedure for analyzing related rates problems.

Here are four applied problems involving related rates.
EXAMPLE 2.6.5
The manager of a company determines that when q hundred units of a particular com-
modity are produced, the total cost of production is C thousand dollars, where
C2  3q3  4,275. When 1,500 units are being produced, the level of production is
increasing at the rate of 20 units per week. What is the total cost at this time and at
what rate is it changing?
Solution
We want to ﬁnd 
when q  15 (1,500 units) and 
 0.2 (20 units per week with q
measured in hundreds of units). Differentiating the equation C 2  3q 3  4,275

so that

When q  15, the cost C satisﬁes

and by substituting q  15, C  120, and 
 0.2 into the formula for 
, we obtain
thousand dollars ($1,687.50) per week. To summarize, the cost of producing 1,500
units is $120,000 (C  120) and at this level of production, total cost is increasing at
the rate of $1,687.50 per week.

EXAMPLE 2.6.6
A storm at sea has damaged an oil rig. Oil spills from the rupture at the constant
rate of 60 ft3/min, forming a slick that is roughly circular in shape and 3 inches thick.
a. How fast is the radius of the slick increasing when the radius is 70 feet?
b. Suppose the rupture is repaired in such a way that the ﬂow is shut off instanta-
neously. If the radius of the slick is increasing at the rate of 0.2 ft/min when the
ﬂow stops, what is the total volume of oil that spilled onto the sea?
Solution
We can think of the slick as a cylinder of oil of radius r feet and thickness h 
 0.25
feet. Such a cylinder will have volume
V  r2h  0.25r2 ft3
Differentiating implicitly in this equation with respect to time t, we get
and since 
at all times, we obtain the rate relationship
a. We want to ﬁnd 
when r  70. Substituting into the rate relationship we have
just obtained, we ﬁnd that
so that
Thus, when the radius is 70 feet, it is increasing at about 0.55 ft/min.
b. We can compute the total volume of oil in the spill if we know the radius of the
slick at the instant the ﬂow stops. Since 
at that instant, we have
60  0.5r(0.2)
and the radius is
Therefore, the total amount of oil spilled is

EXAMPLE 2.6.7
A lake is polluted by waste from a plant located on its shore. Ecologists determine
that when the level of pollutant is x parts per million (ppm), there will be F ﬁsh of
a certain species in the lake, where
When there are 4,000 ﬁsh left in the lake, the pollution is increasing at the rate of
1.4 ppm/year. At what rate is the ﬁsh population changing at this time?
Solution
We want to ﬁnd 
when F  4,000 and 
When there are 4,000 ﬁsh in the
lake, the level of pollution x satisﬁes
We ﬁnd that
and according to the chain rule
Substituting F  4,000, x  25, and 
we ﬁnd that
so the ﬁsh population is decreasing by 70 ﬁsh per year.

Solution
We know that when

note that when p  9, we have
Next, we differentiate both sides of the supply equation implicitly with respect
to time to obtain
Finally, by substituting x  14, p  9, and 
into this rate equation and then
solving for the required rate 
we get
Since the supply is given in terms of thousands of units, it follows that the supply is

Check that your calculator is in function mode (Func) by accessing the MODE menu.
Store f(x)  x2  2x  10 into Y1 of the equation editor (Y ). Graph using a stan-
dard ZOOM window. Find x intercepts by tracing the graph or using the Zoom In
option of ZOOM. Or press CALC (2nd TRACE) and select 2:zero. You will need
to specify a left bound, right bound, and an estimate in the process. Verify algebraically
that the negative root of this function is x  1 
Another method for ﬁnding roots is to use the equation solver feature of your graph-
ing calculator. Access the last item of your MATH key (0:Solver). Write the equa-
tion to be solved, in this case, Y1, into the equation solver, eqn: 0  Y1, and then
press ENTER. Suppose we are trying to locate the positive root for f(x) shown in the
previous graph. That root looks close to x  4, so we use this value as a starting point.
Next press the green ALPHA key and then the ENTER key (SOLVE). The result-
ing value x  4.317 can be veriﬁed to be x  1 
2.
Another way to locate a root is Newton’s method, an iterative root-ﬁnding algo-
rithm that uses tangent line approximations to zero in on a root. See page 166.
Let us apply this method to f(x)  x 2  2x  10. Place f(x) into Y1 and write
Y2  nDeriv(Y1, X, X), which is the numerical derivative of Y1, obtained from
item 8 of the MATH key. Newton’s method requires a starting value. From the
graph of f(x) it appears that the positive root is smaller than x  5. On a cleared
homescreen (QUIT  2nd MODE), store the value 5 into X by writing 5 →X,
and then write Newton’s algorithm, X  Y1(X)/Y2(X) →X. Now press ENTER
successively and observe the sequence of resulting values. Note how many itera-
tions were needed so that two consecutive approximations agree to four (or more)

decimal places. Try a starting value of x  4. Do you construct a sequence of
approximations to the same root? How about if you started at x  2?

We can also use this equation solver feature to locate the roots of the derivative
of a function. As an example, store f(x)  x 2(3x  1) into Y1 of the equation
editor and write Y2  nDeriv(Y1, X, X). Use a bold graphing style for Y2 and
a small size WINDOW, [1, 1]0.2 by [1, 1]0.2. From the following graph, it
is evident that one of the roots of the derivative is x  0. The other root appears
to be close to x  0.2.
To ﬁnd this other root, place Y2 into the equation solver position, eqn: 0 (use the
up arrow to return to the equation solver screen). Use x  0.2 as a starting point, and
then press ALPHA ENTER (SOLVE) to obtain the second root of the derivative.
What happens if you set the starting x value as 0.2?

The codling moth is an insect that causes serious damage to apples. Adult codling
moths emerge from their cocoons in the spring. They soon mate, and the female lays
as many as 130 tiny eggs on the leaves of apple trees. After the codling moth larva,
also known as the common apple worm, hatches from its egg, it goes looking for an
apple. The time between hatching and ﬁnding an apple is called the searching period.
Once a codling moth ﬁnds an apple, it squirms into the apple and eats the fruit and
seeds of the apple, thereby ruining it. After about 4 weeks, the codling moth backs
out of the apple and crawls under the bark of the tree or into the soil where it forms
a cocoon.
Observations regarding the behavior of codling moths indicate that the length of
the searching period, S(T), and the percentage of larvae that survive the searching
period, N(T), depend on the air temperature, T. Methods of data analysis (polynomial
regression) applied to data recorded from observations suggest that if T is measured
in degrees Celsius with 20 	 T 	 30, then S(T) and N(T) may be modeled* by

and
N(T )  0.85T2  45.4T  547
Use these formulas to answer the following questions.

Intuitively, we regard a function f(x) as increasing where the graph of f is rising, and
decreasing where the graph is falling. For instance, the graph in Figure 3.1 shows the
military spending by the former Soviet bloc countries during the crucial period
1990–1995 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a percentage of GDP
(gross domestic product). The shape of the graph suggests that the spending decreased
dramatically from 1990 until 1992, before increasing slightly from 1992 to 1994, after
which it decreased still more.

Here is a more formal deﬁnition of increasing and decreasing functions, which
is illustrated graphically in Figure 3.2.
FIGURE 3.1
Military expenditure of former Soviet bloc countries as a percentage
of GDP.

As demonstrated in Figure 3.3a, if the graph of a function f(x) has tangent lines
with only positive slopes on the interval a  x  b, then the graph will be rising and
f(x) will be increasing on the interval. Since the slope of each such tangent line is
given by the derivative f (x), it follows that f(x) is increasing (graph rising) on inter-
vals where f (x)  0. Similarly, f(x) is decreasing (graph falling) on intervals where
f (x)  0 (Figure 3.3b).
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
■
Let f(x) be a function deﬁned
on the interval a  x  b, and let x1 and x2 be two numbers in the interval. Then
f(x) is increasing on the interval if f(x2)  f(x1) whenever x2  x1.
f(x) is decreasing on the interval if f(x2)  f(x1) whenever x2  x1.

FIGURE 3.3
Derivative criteria for increasing and decreasing functions.
Thanks to the intermediate value property (Section 1.6), we know that a contin-
uous function cannot change sign without ﬁrst becoming 0. This means that if we
mark on a number line all numbers x where f (x) is discontinuous or f (x)  0, the line
will be divided into intervals where f (x) does not change sign. Therefore, if we pick a
test number c from each such interval and ﬁnd that f (c)  0, we know that f (x)  0
for all numbers x in the interval and f(x) must be increasing (graph rising) through-
out the interval. Similarly, if f (c)  0, it follows that f(x) is decreasing (graph falling)
throughout the interval. These observations may be summarized as follows.
This procedure is illustrated in Examples 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.
Procedure for Using the Derivative to Determine Intervals 
of Increase and Decrease for a Function f.
Step 1. Find all values of x for which f (x)  0 or f (x) is not continuous, and
mark these numbers on a number line. This divides the line into a num-
ber of open intervals.
Step 2. Choose a test number c from each interval a  x  b determined in
step 1 and evaluate f (c). Then,
If f (c)  0, the function f(x) is increasing (graph rising) on a  x  b.
If f (c)  0, the function f(x) is decreasing (graph falling) on a  x  b.

EXAMPLE 3.1.1
Find the intervals of increase and decrease for the function

Solution
The derivative of f(x) is
f (x)  6x2  6x  12  6(x  2)(x  1)
which is continuous everywhere, with f (x)  0 where x  1 and x  2. The
numbers 2 and 1 divide the x axis into three open intervals; namely, x  2, 
2  x  1, and x  1. Choose a test number c from each of these intervals; say, 
c  3 from x  2, c  0 from 2  x  1, and c  2 from x  1. Then evaluate
f (c) for each test number:
f (3)  24  0
f (0)  12  0
f (2)  24  0
We conclude that f (x)  0 for x  2 and for x  1, so f(x) is increasing (graph ris-
ing) on these intervals. Similarly, f (x)  0 on 2  x  1, so f(x) is decreasing
(graph falling) on this interval. These results are summarized in Table 3.1. The graph
of f(x) is shown in Figure 3.4.

Can you identify the intervals

Solution
The function is deﬁned for x  2, and its derivative is
which is discontinuous at x  2 and has f (x)  0 at x  0 and x  4. Thus, there are
four intervals on which the sign of f (x) does not change: namely, x  0, 0  x  2,
2  x  4, and x  4. Choosing test numbers in these intervals (say, 2, 1, 3, and 5,

 0
f (1)  3  0

can be drawn at the “sharp” point E. Moreover, there is a horizontal tangent at F that
is neither a peak nor a valley. In this section and the next, you will see how the
methods of calculus can be used to locate and identify the “peaks” and “valleys” of
a graph. This, in turn, provides the basis for a curve sketching procedure and for
methods of optimization.
Less informally, a “peak” on the graph of a function f is known as a relative max-
imum of f, and a “valley” is a relative minimum. Thus, a relative maximum is a point
on the graph of f that is at least as high as any nearby point on the graph, while a rela-
tive minimum is at least as low as any nearby point. Collectively, relative maxima and
minima are called relative extrema. In Figure 3.6, the relative maxima are located at
C and E, and the relative minima are at B, D, and G. Note that a relative extremum
does not have to be the highest or lowest point on the entire graph. For instance, in
Figure 3.6, the lowest point on the graph is at the relative minimum G, but the high-
est point occurs at the right endpoint H. Here is a summary of this terminology.
Since a function f(x) is increasing when f (x)  0 and decreasing when f (x)  0,
the only points where f(x) can have a relative extremum are where f (x)  0 or f (x)
does not exist. Such points are so important that we give them a special name.
It is important to note that while relative extrema occur at critical points, not all
critical points correspond to relative extrema. For example, Figure 3.7 shows three
different situations where f (c)  0, so a horizontal tangent line occurs at the critical
point (c, f (c)). The critical point corresponds to a relative maximum in Figure 3.7a
and to a relative minimum in Figure 3.7b, but neither kind of relative extremum occurs
at the critical point in Figure 3.7c.
Critical Numbers and Critical Points
■
A number c in the domain of
f(x) is called a critical number if either f (c)  0 or f (c) does not exist. The cor-
responding point (c, f(c)) on the graph of f(x) is called a critical point for f(x).
Relative extrema can only occur at critical points.
Relative Extrema
■
The graph of the function f(x) is said to have a relative
maximum at x  c if f(c)  f(x) for all x in an interval a  x  b containing c. Sim-
ilarly, the graph has a relative minimum at x  c if f(c) 	 f(x) on such an interval.
Collectively, the relative maxima and minima of f are called its relative extrema.

Three functions with critical points at which the derivative is undeﬁned are shown
in Figure 3.8. In Figure 3.8c, the tangent line is vertical at (c, f(c)), so the slope f (c)
is undeﬁned. In Figures 3.8a and 3.8b, no (unique) tangent line can be drawn at the
“sharp” point (c, f(c)).
FIGURE 3.8
Three critical points (c, f (c)) where f (c) is undeﬁned.
Figures 3.7 and 3.8 also suggest a method for using the sign of the derivative to clas-
sify critical points as relative maxima, relative minima, or neither. Suppose c is a critical
number of f and that f (x)  0 to the left of c, while f (x)  0 to the right. Geometri-
cally, this means the graph of f goes up before the critical point P(c, f(c)) and then comes
down, which implies that P is a relative maximum. Similarly, if f (x)  0 to the left of
c and f (x)  0 to the right, the graph goes down before P(c, f(c)) and up afterward, so
there must be a relative minimum at P. On the other hand, if the derivative has the same
sign on both sides of c, then the graph either rises through P or falls through P, and no
relative extremum occurs there. These observations can be summarized as follows.

Solution
The polynomial f(x) is deﬁned for all x, and its derivative is
f (x)  8x3  8x  8x(x2  1)  8x(x  1)(x  1)
Since the derivative exists for all x, the only critical numbers are where f (x)  0;
that is, x  0, x  1, and x  1. These numbers divide the x axis into four inter-
vals, on each of which the sign of the derivative does not change; namely, x  1,
1  x  0, 0  x  1, and x  1. Choose a test number c in each of these intervals  
(say, 5, 
, , and 2, respectively) and evaluate f (c) in each case:
Thus, the graph of f falls for x  1 and for 0  x  1, and rises for 1  x  0
and for x  1, so there must be a relative maximum at x  0 and relative minima at
x  1 and x  1, as indicated in this arrow diagram.
Once you determine the intervals of increase and decrease of a function f and ﬁnd its
relative extrema, you can obtain a rough sketch of the graph of the function. Here is
a step-by-step description of the procedure for sketching the graph of a continuous
function f(x) using the derivative f (x). In Section 3.3, we will extend this procedure
to cover the situation where f(x) is discontinuous.
A Procedure for Sketching the Graph of a Continuous 
Function f(x) Using the Derivative f(x)
Step 1. Determine the domain of f(x). Set up a number line restricted to include
only those numbers in the domain of f(x).
Step 2. Find f (x) and mark each critical number on the restricted number
line obtained in step 1. Then analyze the sign of the derivative to
determine intervals of increase and decrease for f(x) on the restricted
number line.
Step 3. For each critical number c, ﬁnd f(c) and plot the critical point P(c, f(c))
on a coordinate plane, with a “cap”        at P if it is a relative maxi-
mum (             ), or a “cup”
if P is a relative minimum (
).
Plot intercepts and other key points that can be easily found.
Step 4. Sketch the graph of f as a smooth curve joining the critical points in
such a way that it rises where f (x)  0, falls where f (x)  0, and has
a horizontal tangent where f (x)  0.

EXAMPLE 3.1.4
Sketch the graph of the function f(x)  x4  8x3  18x2  8.
Solution
Since f(x) is a polynomial, it is deﬁned for all x. Its derivative is
f (x)  4x3  24x2  36x  4x(x2  6x  9)  4x(x  3)2
Since the derivative exists for all x, the only critical numbers are where f (x)  0;
namely, at x  0 and x  3. These numbers divide the x axis into three intervals,
on each of which the sign of the derivative f (x) does not change; namely, x  3,
3  x  0, and x  0. Choose a test number c in each interval (say, 5, 1, and
1, respectively), and determine the sign of f (c):
f (5)  80  0
f (1)  16  0
f (1)  64  0
Thus, the graph of f has horizontal tangents where x is 3 and 0, and the graph is
falling ( f decreasing) in the intervals x  3 and 3  x  0 and is rising ( f increas-
ing) for x  0, as indicated in this arrow diagram:
Interpreting the diagram, we see that the graph falls to a horizontal tangent at
x  3, then continues falling to the relative minimum at x  0, after which it rises
indeﬁnitely. We ﬁnd that f(3)  19 and f(0)  8. To begin your sketch, plot a
“cup” 
at the critical point (0, 8) to indicate that a relative minimum occurs
there (if it had been a relative maximum, you would have used a “cap”

Sketch the graph.
Solution
Since 
is deﬁned only for u  0, the domain of g will be the set of all t such that
3  2t  t2  0. Factoring the expression 3  2t  t2, we get
3  2t  t2  (3  t)(1  t)
Note that 3  t  0 when t  3 and that 1  t  0 when t 	 1. We have
(3  t)(1  t)  0 when both terms are nonnegative; that is, when t  3 and
t 	 1, or equivalently, when 3 	 t 	 1. We would also have (3  t)(1  t)  0 if
3  t 	 0 and 1  t 	 0, but this is not possible (do you see why?). Thus, g(t) is
deﬁned only for 3 	 t 	 1.
Next, using the chain rule, we compute the derivative of g(t):
Note that g(t) does not exist at the endpoints t  3 and t  1 of the domain of
g(t), and that g(t)  0 only when t  1. Next, mark these three critical numbers
on a number line restricted to the domain of g (namely, 3 	 t 	 1) 
and determine the sign of the derivative g(t) on the subintervals 3  t  1 and
1  t  1 to obtain the arrow diagram shown in Figure 3.10a. Finally, compute
g(3)  g(1)  0 and g(1)  2 and observe that the arrow diagram suggests there
is a relative maximum at (1, 2). The completed graph is shown in Figure 3.10b.

Just-In-Time REVIEW
The product ab satisﬁes
ab  0 only when both a  0
and b  0 or when a 	 0 and
b 	 0. If a and b have
opposite signs, then ab 	 0.

Solution
Since the graph of f(x) is falling for 0  x  2, we have f (x)  0 and the graph of
f (x) is below the x axis on this interval. Similarly, for x  0 and for x  2, the graph
of f(x) is rising, so f (x)  0 and the graph of f (x) is above the x axis on both these
intervals. The graph of f(x) is “ﬂat” (horizontal tangent line) at x  0 and x  2, so
f (0)  f (2)  0, and x  0 and x  2 are the x intercepts of the graph of f (x). Here
is one possible graph that satisﬁes these conditions:
Curve sketching using the derivative f (x) will be reﬁned by adding features using
the second derivative f 
(x) in Section 3.2, and a general curve sketching procedure involv-
ing derivatives and limits will be presented in Section 3.3. The same reasoning used to
analyze graphs can be applied to determining optimal values, such as minimum cost of
a production process or maximal sustainable yield for a salmon ﬁshery. Optimization is
illustrated in Example 3.1.7 and is discussed in more detail in Sections 3.4 and 3.5.

Solution
Differentiating R(t) by the quotient rule, we get
By setting the numerator in this expression for R(t) equal to 0, we ﬁnd that t  7 is
the only solution of R(t)  0 in the interval 0 	 t 	 63, and hence is the only criti-
cal number of R(t) in its domain. The critical number divides the domain 0 	 t 	 63
into two intervals, 0 	 t  7 and 7  t 	 63. Evaluating R(t) at test numbers in each
interval (say, at t  1 and t  9), we obtain the arrow diagram shown here.
The arrow pattern indicates that the revenue increases to a maximum t at t  7,
after which it decreases. At the optimal time t  7, the revenue produced is
The graph of the revenue function R(t) is shown in Figure 3.11. It suggests that
immediately after its introduction, the motorized skateboard is a very popular prod-
uct, producing peak revenue of 3.5 million dollars after only 7 weeks. However, its
popularity, as measured by revenue, then begins to wane. After 63 weeks, revenue
ceases altogether as presumably the skateboards are taken off the shelves and replaced
by something new. A product that exhibits this kind of revenue pattern, steep increase
followed by a steady decline toward 0, is sometimes referred to as a “fad.”

SECTION 3.2
Concavity and Points of Inﬂection
In Section 3.1, you saw how to use the sign of the derivative f (x) to determine where
f(x) is increasing and decreasing and where its graph has relative extrema. In this sec-
tion, you will see that the second derivative f 
(x) also provides useful information
about the graph of f(x). By way of introduction, here is a brief description of a situ-
ation from industry that can be analyzed using the second derivative.
The number of units that a factory worker can produce in t hours after arriving at
work is often given by a function Q(t) like the one whose graph is shown in Figure 3.12.
Notice that at ﬁrst the graph is not very steep. The steepness increases, however, until
the graph reaches a point of maximum steepness, after which the steepness begins to
decrease. This reﬂects the fact that at ﬁrst the worker’s rate of production is low. The
rate of production increases, however, as the worker settles into a routine and continues
to increase until the worker is performing at maximum efﬁciency. Then fatigue sets in
and the rate of production begins to decrease. The point P on the output curve where
maximum efﬁciency occurs is known in economics as the point of diminishing returns.

The output Q(t) of a factory worker t hours after coming to work.
The behavior of the graph of this production function on either side of the point of
diminishing returns can be described in terms of its tangent lines. To the left of this point,
the slope of the tangent increases as t increases. To the right of this point, the slope of
the tangent decreases as t increases. It is this increase and decrease of slopes that we shall
examine in this section with the aid of the second derivative. (We shall return to the ques-
tions of worker efﬁciency and diminishing returns in Example 3.2.6, later in this section.)
The increase and decrease of tangential slope will be described in terms of a graph-
ical feature called concavity. Here is the deﬁnition we will use.
Concavity
■
If the function f(x) is differentiable on the interval a  x  b,
then the graph of f is
concave upward on a  x  b if f  is increasing on the interval
concave downward on a  x  b if f  is decreasing on the interval

graph is below each tangent line.

(a) Concave upward graph: The
 
graph is above each tangent line.

FIGURE 3.13
Concavity.
Equivalently, a graph is concave upward on an interval if it lies above all its tan-
gent lines on the interval (Figure 3.13a), and concave downward on an interval where
it lies below all its tangent lines (Figure 3.13b). Informally, a concave upward por-
tion of graph “holds water,” while a concave downward portion “spills water,” as
illustrated in Figure 3.14.
FIGURE 3.14
Concavity and the slope of the tangent.
There is a simple characterization of the concavity of the graph of a function f(x) in
terms of the second derivative f 
(x). In particular, in Section 3.1, we observed that a
function f(x) is increasing where its derivative is positive. Thus, the derivative func-
tion f (x) must be increasing where its derivative f 
(x) is positive. Suppose f 
(x)  0
on an interval a  x  b. Then f (x) is increasing, which in turn means that the graph
of f(x) is concave upward on this interval. Similarly, on an interval a  x  b, where
f 
(x)  0, the derivative f (x) will be decreasing and the graph of f(x) will be con-
cave downward. Using these observations, we can modify the procedure for deter-
mining intervals of increase and decrease developed in Section 3.1 to obtain this
procedure for determining intervals of concavity.

EXAMPLE 3.2.1
Determine intervals of concavity for the function
f(x)  2x6  5x4  7x  3
Solution
We ﬁnd that
f (x)  12x5  20x3  7
and
f 
(x)  60x4  60x2  60x2(x2  1)  60x2(x  1)(x  1)
The second derivative f 
(x) is continuous for all x and f 
(x)  0 for x  0, x  1, and
x  1. These numbers divide the x axis into four intervals on which f 
(x) does not
change sign; namely, x  1, 1  x  0, 0  x  1, and x  1. Evaluating f 
(x)
at test numbers in each of these intervals (say, at x  2, x 
, x 
, and
x  5, respectively), we ﬁnd that
f

f 

 0
f 

 0
f 
(5)  36,000  0
Thus, the graph of f(x) is concave up for x  1 and for x  1 and concave down
for 1  x  0 and for 0  x  1, as indicated in this concavity diagram.

Second Derivative Procedure for Determining Intervals
of Concavity for a Function f
Step 1. Find all values of x for which f 
(x)  0 or f 
(x) does not exist, and
mark these numbers on a number line. This divides the line into a num-
ber of open intervals.
Step 2. Choose a test number c from each interval a  x  b determined in
step 1 and evaluate f 
(c). Then,
If f 
(c)  0, the graph of f(x) is concave upward on a  x  b.
If f 
(c)  0, the graph of f(x) is concave downward on a  x  b.
EXPLORE!
Following Example 3.2.1, store
f(x)  2x6  5x4  7x  3 into
Y1 using a bold graphing
style. Write 
Y2  nDeriv(Y1, X, X) 
but deselect it by moving the
cursor to the equal sign and
pressing ENTER, which will
deﬁne but not graph Y2. Write
Y3  nDeriv(Y2, X, X). Graph
Y1 and Y3 using the window
[2.35, 2.35]1 by [18, 8]2.
How does the behavior of Y3,
representing f
(x), relate to the
concavity of f(x), speciﬁcally at
X  1, 0, and 1?

NOTE
Do not confuse the concavity of a graph with its “direction” (rising or
falling). A function f may be increasing or decreasing on an interval regardless
of whether its graph is concave upward or concave downward on that interval.
The four possibilities are illustrated in Figure 3.16.

FIGURE 3.16
Possible combinations of increase, decrease, and concavity.
A point P(c, f(c)) on the graph of a function f is called an inﬂection point of f if
the concavity of the graph changes at P; that is, the graph of f is concave upward on
one side of P and concave downward on the other side. Such transition points pro-
vide useful information about the graph of f . For instance, the concavity diagram for
the function f(x)  2x6  5x4  7x  3 analyzed in Example 3.2.1 shows that the
concavity of the graph of f changes from upward to downward at x  1 and from
downward to upward at x  1, so the corresponding points (1, 13) and (1, 1) on
the graph are inﬂection points of f. Inﬂection points may also be of practical interest
when interpreting a mathematical model based on f. For example, the point of dimin-
ishing returns on the production curve shown in Figure 3.12 is an inﬂection point.
At an inﬂection point P(c, f(c)), the graph of f can be neither concave upward
( f 
(c)  0) nor concave downward ( f 
(c)  0). Therefore, if f 
(c) exists, we must
have f 
(c)  0. To summarize:
Inﬂection Points
■
An inﬂection point (or point of inﬂection) is a point
(c, f(c)) on the graph of a function f where the concavity changes. At such a point,
either f 
(c)  0 or f 
(c) does not exist.

In each case, ﬁnd all inﬂection points of the given function.

f (x)  15x4  20x3
f

Thus, f 
(x) is continuous for all x and f 
(x)  0 when x  0 and x  1. Testing
the sign of f 
(x) on each side of x  0 and x  1 (say, at x  1, , and 2), we get
f 
(1)  120  0
f 
 0
f 
(2)  240  0
which leads to the concavity pattern shown in this diagram:
We see that the concavity does not change at x  0 but changes from downward
to upward at x  1. Since f(1)  3, it follows that (1, 3) is an inﬂection point
of f. The graph of f is shown in Figure 3.17a.

Procedure for Finding the Inﬂection Points for a Function f
Step 1. Compute f 
(x) and determine all points in the domain of f where either
f 
(c)  0 or f 
(c) does not exist.
Step 2. For each number c found in step 1, determine the sign of f 
(x) to the left
and to the right of x  c; that is, for x  c and for x  c. If f 
(x)  0
on one side of x  c and f 
(x)  0 on the other side, then (c, f(c)) is
an inﬂection point for f .

b. The function g(x) is continuous for all x and since
it follows that g
(x) is never 0 but does not exist when x  0. Testing the sign of
g
(x) on each side of x  0, we obtain the results displayed in this concavity diagram:
Since the concavity of the graph changes at x  0 and g(0)  0, there is an inﬂec-
tion point at the origin, (0, 0). The graph of g is shown in Figure 3.17b.
NOTE
A function can have an inﬂection point only where it is continuous. In
particular, if f(c) is not deﬁned, there cannot be an inﬂection point corresponding 
to x  c even if f 
(x) changes sign at x  c. For example, if 
then 
so f 
(x)  0 if x  0 and f 
(x)  0 if x  0. The concavity changes 
from downward to upward at x  0 (see Figure 3.18a) but there is no inﬂection
point at x  0 since f(0) is not deﬁned.
Moreover, just knowing that f(c) is deﬁned and that f 
(c)  0 does not guar-
antee that (c, f(c)) is an inﬂection point. For instance, if f(x)  x 4, then f(0)  0
and f 
(x)  12x2, so f 
(0)  0. However, f 
(x)  0 for any number x  0, so the
graph of f is always concave upward, and there is no inﬂection point at (0, 0)
(see Figure 3.18b).
Do you think that if f(c) is deﬁned and f 
(c)  0, then you can at least con-
clude that either an inﬂection point or a relative extremum occurs at x  c? For
the answer, see Exercise 69.

Figure 3.19 shows several ways that inﬂection points can occur on a graph.
FIGURE 3.19
A graph showing concavity and inﬂection points.
By adding the criteria for concavity and inﬂection points to the ﬁrst derivative
methods discussed in Section 3.1, you can sketch a variety of graphs with consider-
able detail. Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 3.2.3
Determine where the function
f(x)  3x4  2x3  12x2  18x  15
is increasing and decreasing, and where its graph is concave up and concave down.
Find all relative extrema and points of inﬂection and sketch the graph.
Solution
First, note that since f(x) is a polynomial, it is continuous for all x, as are the deriv-
atives f (x) and f 
(x). The ﬁrst derivative of f(x) is
f (x)  12x3  6x2  24x  18  6(x  1)2(2x  3)
and f (x)  0 only when x  1 and x  1.5. The sign of f (x) does not change for
x  1.5, nor in the interval 1.5  x  1, nor for x  1. Evaluating f (x) at test

numbers in each interval (say, at 2, 0, and 3), you obtain the arrow diagram shown.
Note that there is a relative minimum at x  1.5 but no extremum at x  1.
The second derivative is
f 
(x)  36x2  12x  24  12(x  1)(3x  2)
and f 
(x)  0 only when x  1 and x 
. The sign of f 
(x) does not change on
each of the intervals x 
 x  1, and x  1. Evaluating f 
(x) at test 
numbers in each interval, you obtain the concavity diagram shown.
The patterns in these two diagrams suggest that there is a relative minimum at 
x  1.5 and inﬂection points at x 
and x  1 (since the concavity changes at
both points).

CONCAVITY AND POINTS OF INFLECTION

To sketch the graph, you ﬁnd that
and plot a “cup” 
at (1.5, 17.06) to mark the relative minimum located there. 
Likewise, plot twists 
at 
and 
at (1, 22) to mark the shape of the
graph near the inﬂection points. Using the arrow and concavity diagrams, you get the
preliminary diagram shown in Figure 3.20a. Finally, complete the sketch as shown in
Figure 3.20b by passing a smooth curve through the minimum point, the inﬂection
points, and the y intercept (0, 15).
Sometimes you are given the graph of a derivative function f (x) and asked to
analyze the graph of f(x) itself. For instance, it would be quite reasonable for a man-
ufacturer who knows the marginal cost C(x) associated with producing x units of a
particular commodity to want to know as much as possible about the total cost C(x).
The following example illustrates a procedure for carrying out this kind of analysis.
EXAMPLE 3.2.4
The graph of the derivative f (x) of a function f(x) is shown in the ﬁgure. Find inter-
vals of increase and decrease and concavity for f(x) and locate all relative extrema
and inﬂection points. Then sketch a curve that has all these features.
Solution
First, note that for x  1, the graph of f (x) is above the x axis, so f (x)  0 and
the graph of f(x) is rising. The graph of f (x) is also falling for x  1, which means
that f 
(x)  0 and the graph of f(x) is concave down. Other intervals can be analyzed
in a similar fashion, and the results are summarized in the table.

Since the concavity changes at x  1 (down to up), an inﬂection point occurs there,
along with a horizontal tangent. At x  2, there is also an inﬂection point (concavity
changes from up to down), but no horizontal tangent. The graph of f(x) is rising to the
left of x  5 and falling to the right, so there must be a relative maximum at x  5.
One possible graph that has all the features required for y  f(x) is shown in
Figure 3.21. Note, however, that since you are not given the values of f(1), f(2),
and f(5), many other graphs will also satisfy the requirements.

The second derivative can also be used to classify a critical point of a function as a
relative maximum or minimum. Here is a statement of the procedure, which is known
as the second derivative test.
FIGURE 3.22
The second derivative test.
To see why the second derivative test works, look at Figure 3.22, which shows four
possibilities that can occur when f (c)  0. Figure 3.22a suggests that at a relative max-
imum, the graph of f must be concave downward, so f 
(c)  0. Likewise, at a relative
minimum (Figure 3.22b), the graph of f must be concave upward, so f 
(c)  0. On the
other hand, if f (c)  0 and f 
(c) is neither positive nor negative, the test is inconclusive.

Suppose f

If f

If f 
(c)  0, then f has a relative maximum at x  c.
However, if f 
(c)  0 or if f 
(c) does not exist, the test is inconclusive and f may
have a relative maximum, a relative minimum, or no relative extremum at all at
x  c.

SECTION 3.2
CONCAVITY AND POINTS OF INFLECTION

Figure 3.22c suggests that if f (c)  0 and f 
(c)  0, there may be an inﬂection point
at x  c. There may also be a relative extremum. For example, f (x)  x4 has a relative
minimum at x  0 and g(x)  x4 has a relative maximum (see Figure 3.24.)
The second derivative test is illustrated in Example 3.2.5.
EXAMPLE 3.2.5
Find the critical points of f(x)  2x3  3x2  12x  7 and use the second derivative
test to classify each critical point as a relative maximum or minimum.
Solution
Since the ﬁrst derivative
f (x)  6x2  6x  12  6(x  2)(x  1)
is zero when x  2 and x  1, the corresponding points (2, 13) and (1, 14) are
the critical points of f. To test these points, compute the second derivative
f 
(x)  12x  6
and evaluate it at x  2 and x  1. Since
f 
(2)  18  0
it follows that the critical point (2, 13) is a relative maximum, and since
f 
(1)  18  0
it follows that the critical point (1, 14) is a relative minimum. For reference, the
graph of f is sketched in Figure 3.23.
NOTE
Although it was easy to use the second derivative test to classify critical
points in Example 3.2.5, the test does have some limitations. For some functions,
the work involved in computing the second derivative is time-consuming, which
may diminish the appeal of the test. Moreover, the test applies only to critical
points at which the derivative is zero and not to those where the derivative is unde-
ﬁned. Finally, if both f (c) and f 
(c) are zero, the second derivative test tells you
nothing about the nature of the critical point. This is illustrated in Figure 3.24,
which shows the graphs of three functions whose ﬁrst and second derivatives are
both zero when x  0. When it is inconvenient or impossible to apply the second
derivative test, you may still be able to use the ﬁrst derivative test described in
Section 3.1 to classify critical points.

In Example 3.2.6, we return to the questions of worker efﬁciency and diminishing
returns examined in the illustration at the beginning of this section. Our goal is to max-
imize a worker’s rate of production; that is, the derivative of the worker’s output. Hence,
we will set to zero the second derivative of output and ﬁnd an inﬂection point of the
output function, which we interpret as the point of diminishing returns for production.
EXAMPLE 3.2.6
An efﬁciency study of the morning shift at a factory indicates that an average worker
who starts at 8:00 A.M. will have produced Q(t)  t3  9t2  12t units t hours later.
At what time during the morning is the worker performing most efﬁciently?
Solution
The worker’s rate of production is the derivative of the output Q(t); that is,
R(t)  Q(t)  3t2  18t  12
Assuming that the morning shift runs from 8:00 A.M. until noon, the goal is to ﬁnd
the largest rate R(t) for 0 	 t 	 4. The derivative of the rate function is
R(t)  Q
(t)  6t  18
which is zero when t  3, positive for 0  t  3, and negative for 3  t  4, as indi-
cated in the arrow diagram shown.
Thus, the rate of production R(t) increases for 0  t  3, decreases for 3  t  4,
and has its maximum value when t  3 (11:00 A.M.) This means that the output func-
tion Q(t) has an inﬂection point at t  3, since Q
(t)  R(t) changes sign at that time.
The graph of the production function Q(t) is shown in Figure 3.25a, while that of the
production rate function R(t) is shown in Figure 3.25b.

SECTION 3.3
Curve Sketching
So far in this chapter, you have seen how to use the derivative f (x) to determine
where the graph of f(x) is rising and falling and to use the second derivative f 
(x) to
determine the concavity of the graph. While these tools are adequate for locating the
high and low points of a graph and for sculpting its twists and turns, there are other
graphical features that are best described using limits.
Recall from Section 1.5 that a limit of the form 
or 
, in
which the independent variable x either increases or decreases without bound, is called
a limit at inﬁnity. On the other hand, if the functional values f(x) themselves grow
without bound as x approaches a number c, we say that f(x) has an inﬁnite limit at
x  c and write 
if f(x) increases indeﬁnitely as x approaches c or 
if f(x) decreases indeﬁnitely. Collectively, limits at inﬁnity and
inﬁnite limits are referred to as limits involving inﬁnity. Our ﬁrst goal in this sec-
tion is to see how limits involving inﬁnity may be interpreted as graphical features.
This information will then be combined with the derivative methods of Sections 3.1
and 3.2 to form a general procedure for sketching graphs.
Limits involving inﬁnity can be used to describe graphical features called asymptotes.
In particular, the graph of a function f(x) is said to have a vertical asymptote at
x  c if f(x) increases or decreases without bound as x tends toward c, from either
the right or the left.
For instance, consider the rational function
As x approaches 2 from the left (x  2), the functional values decrease without bound,
but they increase without bound if the approach is from the right (x  2). This behav-
ior is illustrated in the table and demonstrated graphically in Figure 3.26.

CURVE SKETCHING

In general, a rational function 
has a vertical asymptote x  c whenever
q(c)  0 but p(c)  0. Here is an example of a function with a vertical asymptote.
EXAMPLE 3.3.1
Determine all vertical asymptotes of the graph of
Solution
Let p(x)  x2  9 and q(x)  x2  3x be the numerator and denominator of f(x),
respectively. Then q(x)  0 when x  3 and when x  0. However, for x  3, we
also have p(3)  0 and
This means that the graph of f(x) has a “hole” at the point (3, 2) and x  3 is not
a vertical asymptote of the graph.
On the other hand, for 
we have q(0)  0 but 
which suggests
that the y axis (the vertical line x  0) is a vertical asymptote for the graph of f(x).
This asymptotic behavior is veriﬁed by noting that
The graph of f(x) is shown in Figure 3.27.

In general, when a function f(x) tends toward a ﬁnite value b as x either increases or
decreases without bound (or both as in our example), then the horizontal line y  b
is called a horizontal asymptote of the graph of f(x). Here is a deﬁnition.

A General Procedure for Sketching the Graph of f(x)
Step 1. Find the domain of f(x) (that is, where f(x) is deﬁned).
Step 2. Find and plot all intercepts. The y intercept (where x  0) is usually easy
to ﬁnd, but the x intercepts (where f(x)  0) may require a calculator.
Step 3. Determine all vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the graph. Draw the
asymptotes in a coordinate plane.
Step 4. Find f (x) and use it to determine the critical numbers of f(x) and inter-
vals of increase and decrease.
Step 5. Determine all relative extrema (both coordinates). Plot each relative max-
imum with a “cap” (    ) and each relative minimum with a “cup” (     ).
Step 6. Find f 
(x) and use it to determine intervals of concavity and points of
inﬂection. Plot each inﬂection point with a “twist” to suggest the shape
of the graph near the point.
Step 7. You now have a preliminary graph, with asymptotes in place, intercepts
plotted, arrows indicating the direction of the graph, and “caps,” “cups,”
and “twists” suggesting the shape at key points. Plot additional points
if needed, and complete the sketch by joining the plotted points in the
directions indicated. Be sure to remember that the graph cannot cross a
vertical asymptote.
NOTE
The graph of a function f(x) can never cross a vertical asymptote x  c
because at least one of the one-sided limits 
f(x) and 
f(x) must be inﬁ-
nite. However, it is quite possible for a graph to cross its horizontal asymptotes.
For instance, in Example 3.3.2, the graph of 
crosses the hori-
zontal asymptote y  1 at the point where
that is, at the point (1, 1).

of graphs.

cept is the origin (0, 0).

Step 3. The line x  1 is a vertical asymptote of the graph of f(x) since f(x)
decreases indeﬁnitely as x approaches 1 from either side; that is,
Moreover, since 
the line y  0 (the x axis) is a horizontal asymptote. Draw dashed lines x  1 and
y  0 on a coordinate plane.
Step 4. Applying the quotient rule, compute the derivative of f(x):
Since f (1)  0, it follows that x  1 is a critical number. Note that even though
f (1) does not exist, x  1 is not a critical number since it is not in the domain
of f(x). Place x  1 and x  1 on a number line with a dashed vertical line at
x  1 to indicate the vertical asymptote there. Then evaluate f (x) at appropriate
test numbers (say, at 2, 0, and 3) to obtain the arrow diagram shown.
Step 5. The arrow pattern in the diagram obtained in step 4 indicates there is a rel-
ative maximum at x  1. Since f(1) 
, we plot a “cap” at 
Step 6. Apply the quotient rule again to get
Since f 
(x)  0 at x  2 and f 
(x) does not exist at x  1, plot 1 and 2 on a num-
ber line and check the sign of f 
(x) on the intervals x  1, 1  x  2, and x  2

Step 7. The preliminary graph is shown in Figure 3.29a. Note that the vertical

arate part by a smooth curve to obtain the completed graph shown in Figure 3.29b.

Solution
Since x2  2x  15  (x  5)(x  3), the function f(x) is deﬁned for all x except
x  5 and x  3. The only intercept is the origin (0, 0).
We see that x  3 and x  5 are vertical asymptotes because if we write f(x) 
p(x)/q(x), where p(x)  3x2 and q(x)  x2  2x  15, then q(3)  0 and q(5)  0,
while p(3)  0 and p(5)  0. Moreover, y  3 is a horizontal asymptote since

Store the function f(x) in

graph of f(x) behave as you
trace out points with large x
values?

We see that f (x)  0 when x  0 and x  15 and that f (x) does not exist when x  5
and x  3. Put x  5, 0, 3, and 15 on a number line and obtain the arrow diagram
shown in Figure 3.30a by determining the sign of f (x) at appropriate test numbers (say,
at 7, 1, 2, 5, and 20). Interpreting the arrow diagram, we see that there is a relative
maximum at x  0 and a relative minimum at x  15. Since f(0)  0 and f(15)  2.81,
we plot a “cap” at (0, 0) on our preliminary graph and a “cup” at (15, 2.81).

x  22.7 corresponds to an inﬂection point since x  5 and x  3 are not in the

When f (c) does not exist at a number x  c in the domain of f(x), there are sev-
eral possibilities for the graph of f(x) at the point (c, f(c)). Two such cases are exam-
ined in Example 3.3.5.
EXAMPLE 3.3.5
Sketch the graphs of f(x)  x2/3 and g(x)  (x  1)1/3.
Solution
Both functions are deﬁned for all x. For f(x)  x2/3, we have
The only critical point is (0, 0) and the intervals of increase and decrease and con-
cavity are as shown:
Interpreting these diagrams, we conclude that the graph of f(x) is concave downward
for all x  0 but is falling for x  0 while rising for x  0. Thus, the graph of f(x)
has a relative minimum at the origin (0, 0) and its shape there is 
, called a “cusp.”
The graph of f(x) is shown in Figure 3.32a.

The only critical point is (1, 0), and we obtain the intervals of increase and decrease
and concavity shown:
Thus, the graph of g(x) is rising for all x  1 but is concave upward for x  1 and
concave downward for x  1. This means that (1, 0) is an inﬂection point, but in addi-
tion, note that
Geometrically, this means that as x approaches 0 from either side, the tangent 
line at (x, g(x)) becomes steeper and steeper (with positive slope). This can be inter-
preted as saying that the graph of g(x) has a tangent line at (1, 0) with “inﬁnite” slope,
that is, a vertical tangent line. The graph of g(x) is shown in Figure 3.32b.
Sometimes, it is useful to represent observations about a quantity in graphical
form. This procedure is illustrated in Example 3.3.6.
EXAMPLE 3.3.6
The population of a community is 230,000 in 1990 and increases at an increasing rate
for 5 years, reaching the 300,000 level in 1995. It then continues to rise, 
but at a decreasing rate until it peaks out at 350,000 in 2002. After that, the population
decreases, at a decreasing rate for 3 years to 320,000 and then at an increasing
rate, approaching 280,000 in the long run. Represent this information in graphical form.
Solution
Let P(t) denote the population of the community t years after the base year 1990,
where P is measured in units of 10,000 people. Since the population increases at an
increasing rate for 5 years from 230,000 to 300,000, the graph of P(t) rises from
(0, 23) to (5, 30) and is concave upward for 0  t  5. The population then contin-
ues to increase until 2002, but at a decreasing rate, until it reaches a maximum value
of 350,000. That is, the graph continues to rise from (5, 30) to a high point at (12, 35)
but is now concave downward. Since the graph changes concavity at x  5 (from up
to down), it has an inﬂection point at (5, 30).
For the next 3 years, the population decreases at a decreasing rate, so the graph of
P(t) is falling and concave downward for 12  t  15. Since the population continues
to decrease from the 320,000 level reached in 2005 but at an increasing rate, the graph
falls from the point (15, 32) for t  15 but is concave upward. The change in concav-
ity at x  15 (from down to up) means that (15, 32) is another inﬂection point.
The statement that “the population decreases at an increasing rate” for t  15
means that the population is changing at a negative rate, which is becoming less neg-
ative with increasing time. In other words, the decline in population “slows down”
after 2005. This, coupled with the statement that the population “approaches 280,000

Optimization; Elasticity of Demand
You have already seen several situations where the methods of calculus were used to
determine the largest or smallest value of a function of interest (for example, maxi-
mum proﬁt or minimum cost). In most such optimization problems, the goal is to ﬁnd
the absolute maximum or absolute minimum of a particular function on some rele-
vant interval. The absolute maximum of a function on an interval is the largest value
of the function on that interval, and the absolute minimum is the smallest value. Here
is a deﬁnition of absolute extrema.
Absolute extrema often coincide with relative extrema but not always. For
example, in Figure 3.34 the absolute maximum and relative maximum on the
interval a  x  b are the same, but the absolute minimum occurs at the left end-
point, x  a.
FIGURE 3.34
Absolute extrema.
In this section, you will learn how to ﬁnd absolute extrema of functions on
intervals. We begin by considering intervals a  x  b that are “closed” in the sense
they include both endpoints, a and b. It can be shown that a function continuous
on such an interval has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on
the interval. Moreover, each absolute extremum must occur either at an endpoint of
the interval (at a or b) or at a critical number c between a and b (Figure 3.35). To

Absolute Maxima and Minima of a Function
■
Let f be a function
deﬁned on an interval I that contains the number c. Then 
f(c) is the absolute maximum of f on I if f(c)  f(x) for all x in I
f(c) is the absolute minimum of f on I if f(c)  f(x) for all x in I
Collectively, absolute maxima and minima are called absolute extrema.

Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of the function
f(x)  2x3  3x2  12x  7
on the interval 3 	 x 	 0.
Solution
From the derivative
f (x)  6x2  6x  12  6(x  2)(x  1)
we see that the critical numbers are x  2 and x  1. Of these, only x  2 lies in the
interval 3 	 x 	 0. Compute f(x) at x  2 and at the endpoints x  3 and x  0.
f(2)  13
f(3)  2
f(0)  7
Compare these values to conclude that the absolute maximum of f on the interval
3 	 x 	 0 is f(2)  13 and the absolute minimum is f(0)  7.
Notice that we did not have to classify the critical points or draw the graph to
locate the absolute extrema. The sketch in Figure 3.36 is presented only for the sake
of illustration.
EXAMPLE 3.4.2
For several weeks, the highway department has been recording the speed of freeway
trafﬁc ﬂowing past a certain downtown exit. The data suggest that between 1:00 and
6:00 P.M. on a normal weekday, the speed of the trafﬁc at the exit is approximately
S(t)  t3  10.5t2  30t  20 miles per hour, where t is the number of hours past
noon. At what time between 1:00 and 6:00 P.M. is the trafﬁc moving the fastest, and
at what time is it moving the slowest?
Solution
The goal is to ﬁnd the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of the function S(t)
on the interval 1 	 t 	 6. From the derivative
S(t)  3t2  21t  30  3(t2  7t  10)  3(t  2)(t  5)
we get the critical numbers t  2 and t  5, both of which lie in the interval 1 	 t 	 6.
Compute S(t) for these values of t and at the endpoints t  1 and t  6 to get
S(1)  40.5
S(2)  46
S(5)  32.5
S(6)  38
Since the largest of these values is S(2)  46 and the smallest is S(5)  32.5, we can
conclude that the trafﬁc is moving fastest at 2:00 P.M., when its speed is 46 miles per
hour, and slowest at 5:00 P.M., when its speed is 32.5 miles per hour. For reference,
the graph of S is sketched in Figure 3.37.

EXAMPLE 3.4.3
When you cough, the radius of your trachea (windpipe) decreases, affecting the speed
of the air in the trachea. If r0 is the normal radius of the trachea, the relationship
between the speed S of the air and the radius r of the trachea during a cough is given
by a function of the form S(r)  ar2(r0  r), where a is a positive constant.* Find the
radius r for which the speed of the air is greatest.
Solution
The radius r of the contracted trachea cannot be greater than the normal radius r0 or
less than zero. Hence, the goal is to ﬁnd the absolute maximum of S(r) on the inter-
val 0 	 r 	 r0.
First differentiate S(r) with respect to r using the product rule and factor the deriv-
ative as follows (note that a and r0 are constants):
S(r)  ar2  (r0  r)(2ar)  ar[r  2(r0  r)]  ar(2r0  3r)
Then set the factored derivative equal to zero and solve to get the critical numbers:
ar(2r0  3r)  0
Both of these values of r lie in the interval 0 	 r 	 r0, and one is actually an end-
point of the interval. Compute S(r) for these two values of r and for the other endpoint

Compare these values and conclude that the speed of the air is greatest when the
radius of the contracted trachea is 
that is, when it is two-thirds the radius of the
uncontracted trachea.
A graph of the function S(r) is given in Figure 3.38. Note that the r intercepts of
the graph are obvious from the factored function S(r)  ar2(r0  r). Notice also that
the graph has a horizontal tangent when r  0, reﬂecting the fact that S(0)  0.
When the interval on which you wish to maximize or minimize a continuous func-
tion is not of the form a 	 x 	 b, the procedure illustrated in Examples 3.4.1 through
3.4.3 no longer applies. This is because there is no longer any guarantee that the func-
tion actually has an absolute maximum or minimum on the interval in question. On
the other hand, if an absolute extremum does exist and the function is continuous on
the interval, the absolute extremum will still occur at a relative extremum or endpoint
contained in the interval. Several possibilities for functions on unbounded intervals
are illustrated in Figure 3.39.
FIGURE 3.39
Extrema for functions deﬁned on unbounded intervals.
To ﬁnd the absolute extrema of a continuous function on an interval that is not
of the form a 	 x 	 b, you still evaluate the function at all the critical points and
endpoints that are contained in the interval. However, before you can draw any ﬁnal
conclusions, you must ﬁnd out if the function actually has relative extrema on the
interval. One way to do this is to use the ﬁrst derivative to determine where the func-
tion is increasing and where it is decreasing and then to sketch the graph. The technique
is illustrated in Example 3.4.4.
EXAMPLE 3.4.4
If they exist, ﬁnd the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of the function

Since f (x)  0 for 0  x  2 and f (x)  0 for x  2, the graph of f is decreas-
ing for 0  x  2 and increasing for x  2, as shown in Figure 3.40. It follows that
is the absolute minimum of f on the interval x  0 and that there is no absolute
maximum.
The procedure illustrated in Example 3.4.4 can be used whenever we wish to ﬁnd
the largest or smallest value of a function f that is continuous on an interval I on
which it has exactly one critical number c. In particular, if this condition is satisﬁed
and f(x) has a relative maximum (minimum) at x  c, it also has an absolute
maximum (minimum) there. To see why, suppose the graph has a relative minimum
at x  c. Then the graph is always falling before c and always rising after c, since to
change direction would require the presence of a second critical point (Figure 3.41).
Thus, the relative minimum is also the absolute minimum. These observations suggest
that any test for relative extrema becomes a test for absolute extrema in this special
case. Here is a statement of the second derivative test for absolute extrema.
Example 3.4.5 illustrates how the second derivative test for absolute extrema can
be used in practice.
EXAMPLE 3.4.5
A manufacturer estimates that when q thousand units of a particular commodity

it follows that P(q)  0 when R(q)  C(q). If it is also true that P

is C(q)  0.4q2  3q  40, so the marginal revenue is R(q)  2.4q  22.2 and the

In part (c) of Example 3.4.5, you found that marginal cost equals average cost at
the level of production where average cost is minimized. This, too, is no accident. To
see why, let C(q) be the cost of producing q units of a commodity. Then the average
cost per unit is 
, and by applying the quotient rule, you get
Thus, A(q)  0 when the numerator on the right is zero. That is, when
qC(q)  C(q)
or equivalently, when
To show that average cost is actually minimized where average cost equals mar-
ginal cost, it is necessary to make a few reasonable assumptions about total cost
(see Exercise 56).
Here is an informal explanation of the relationship between average and mar-
ginal cost that is often given in economics texts. The marginal cost (MC) is approx-
imately the same as the cost of producing one additional unit. If the additional unit
costs less to produce than the average cost (AC) of the existing units (if MC  AC),
then this less-expensive unit will cause the average cost per unit to decrease. On the
other hand, if the additional unit costs more than the average cost of the existing
units (if MC  AC), then this more-expensive unit will cause the average cost per
unit to increase. However, if the cost of the additional unit is equal to the average
cost of the existing units (if MC  AC), then the average cost will neither increase
nor decrease, which means (AC)  0.
The relation between average cost and marginal cost can be generalized
to apply to any pair of average and marginal quantities. The only possible modi-
ﬁcation involves the nature of the critical point that occurs when the average quan-
tity equals the marginal quantity. For example, average revenue usually has a
relative maximum (instead of a minimum) when average revenue equals marginal
revenue.
In Section 1.1, we introduced the economic concept of demand as a means for
expressing the relationship between the unit price p of a commodity and the number
of units q that will be demanded (that is, produced and purchased) by consumers at

Price Elasticity of Demand
■
If q  D( p) units of a commodity are
demanded by the market at a unit price p, where D is a differentiable function,
then the price elasticity of demand for the commodity is given by
and has the interpretation
E( p) 
percentage rate of change in demand q
produced by a 1% rate of change in price p
E( p)  p
q dq

that price. Previously, we have expressed unit price p as a function of production level
q, but for the present discussion, it is more convenient to turn things around and write
the demand relationship as q  D( p).
In general, an increase in the unit price of a commodity will result in decreased
demand, but the sensitivity or responsiveness of demand to a change in price varies
from one product to another. For instance, the demand for products such as soap,
ﬂashlight batteries, or salt will not be much affected by a small percentage change in
unit price, while a comparable percentage change in the price of airline tickets or
home loans can affect demand dramatically.
Sensitivity of demand is commonly measured by the ratio of the percentage rate of
change in quantity demanded to the percentage rate of change in price. This is approx-
imately the same as the change in demand produced by a 1% change in unit price.
Recall from Section 2.2 that the percentage rate of change of a quantity Q(x) is given 
by 
. In particular, if the demand function q  D(p) is differentiable, then
and
Thus, sensitivity to change in price is measured by the ratio
which, in economics, is called the price elasticity of demand. To summarize:

Therefore, since q  0 and p  0, it follows that the price elasticity of demand
will be negative: that is,
For instance, to say that a particular commodity has a price elasticity of demand
of 0.5 at a certain unit price p means that a 10% rise in price for the com-
modity will result in a decline of approximately 5% in the number of units
demanded (sold). These ideas are illustrated further in Example 3.4.6.

in demand of approximately 0.71%.

At this price, a 1% increase in price will result in a decrease in demand of approx-
imately the same percentage.

There are three levels of elasticity, depending on whether 	E(p)	 is greater than,
less than, or equal to 1. Here is a description and economic interpretation of each level.
For instance, in Example 3.4.6b, we found that E(100)  5. Thus, the demand
is elastic with respect to price when p  100 since 	E(100)	  5  1. In part (c) of
the same example, we found that 	E(50)	  	0.71	  1, so the demand is inelastic
when p  50. Finally, in part (d), we found 	E(60)	  	1	  1, which means that the
demand is of unit elasticity when p  60.
The level of elasticity of demand for a commodity gives useful information about
the total revenue R obtained from the sale of q units of the commodity at p dollars per
unit. Assuming that the demand q is a differentiable function of unit price p, the rev-
enue is R(p)  pq(p) and by differentiating implicitly with respect to p, we ﬁnd that
To get the elasticity 
into the picture, simply multiply the expression on
the right-hand side by 
as follows:
Suppose demand is elastic so that 	E(p)	  1. It follows that E(p)  1 [since
E(p)  0] so that [E( p)  1]  0 and
which means that the result of a small increase in price will be to decrease revenue. 
Similarly, when demand is inelastic, we have 1  E( p)  0 so that [E( p)  1]  0
and 
. In this case, a small increase in price results in increased revenue. If the 
demand is of unit elasticity, then E( p)  1 so 
and a small increase in price 
leaves revenue approximately unchanged (neither increased nor decreased). These 
observations are summarized as follows.

Levels of Elasticity and the Effect on Revenue

If demand is inelastic (	E(p)	  1), revenue R increases as price p increases.
If demand is of unit elasticity (	E(p)	  1), revenue is unaffected by a small
change in price.

. If 0 	 p  10, then
so the demand is inelastic. Likewise, if 10  p 
, then
and the demand is elastic.
b. The total revenue, R  pq, increases when demand is inelastic; that is, when
0 	 p  10. For this range of prices, a speciﬁed percentage increase in price
results in a smaller percentage decrease in demand, so the bookstore will take in
more money for each increase in price up to $10 per copy.
However, for the price range 10  p 	 
the demand is elastic, so the
revenue is decreasing. If the book is priced in this range, a speciﬁed percentage
increase in price results in a larger percentage decrease in demand. Thus, if the
bookstore increases the price beyond $10 per copy, it will lose revenue.
This means that the optimal price is $10 per copy, which corresponds to
unit elasticity. The graphs of the demand and revenue functions are shown in
Figure 3.44.

twice as much for selling a Moppsy doll as for
selling a Floppsy doll. Find the level of
production (both x and y) for which the total
revenue derived from selling these dolls is

47. WORKER EFFICIENCY
An efﬁciency study of
the morning shift at a certain factory indicates that
an average worker who is on the job at 8.00 A.M.
will have assembled 
units x hours later. The study indicates further that
after a 15-minute coffee break the worker can 
assemble 
units in x hours.
Determine the time between 8.00 A.M. and noon
at which a 15-minute coffee break should be
scheduled so that the worker will assemble the

after the break.]
48. NATIONAL CONSUMPTION
Assume that
total national consumption is given by a function
C(x), where x is the total national income. The

propensity to save. Suppose the consumption
function is

marginal propensity to consume, and determine
the value of x that results in the smallest total
savings.

Assuming r is constant, what choice of R results
in maximum power?

It is known
that a quantity of water that occupies 1 liter at
0°C will occupy
liters when the temperature is T°C, for 0 	 T 	 30.

0 	 T 	 10. The density of water is maximized
when V(T) is minimized. At what temperature
does this occur?
b. Does the answer to part (a) surprise you? It
should. Water is the only common liquid whose
maximum density occurs above its freezing
point (0°C for water). Read an article on the sur-
vival of aquatic life during the winter and then

examined in this problem is related to such
survival.

54. AMPLITUDE OF OSCILLATION
In physics, it
can be shown that a particle forced to oscillate in
a resisting medium has amplitude A(r) given by
where r is the ratio of the forcing frequency to the
natural frequency of oscillation and k is a positive
constant that measures the damping effect of the
resisting medium. Show that A(r) has exactly one
positive critical number. Does it correspond to a
relative maximum or a relative minimum? Can
anything be said about the absolute extrema of A(r)?

with radius r. Use the formula for the speed of
air in the trachea during a cough given in Exam-
ple 3.4.3 to express air ﬂow F in terms of r.

a commodity are produced at a total cost of C(q) 
dollars and an average cost of

section, we showed that q  qc satisﬁes A(qc)  0 
if and only if C(qc)  A(qc); that is, when
marginal cost equals average cost. The purpose of
this problem is to show that A(q) is minimized
when q  qc.
a. Generally speaking, the cost of producing a
commodity increases at an increasing rate as
more and more goods are produced. Using this
economic principle, what can be said about the
sign of C

SECTION 3.5
Additional Applied Optimization
In Section 3.4, you saw a number of applications in which a formula was given and
it was required to determine either a maximum or a minimum value. In practice, things
are often not that simple, and it is necessary to ﬁrst gather information about a quan-
tity of interest and then formulate and analyze an appropriate mathematical model.
In this section, you will learn how to combine the techniques of model-building
from Section 1.4 with the optimization techniques of Section 3.4. Here is a procedure
for dealing with such problems.
This procedure is illustrated in Examples 3.5.1 through 3.5.3.
EXAMPLE 3.5.1
The highway department is planning to build a picnic park for motorists along a major
highway. The park is to be rectangular with an area of 5,000 square yards and is to
be fenced off on the three sides not adjacent to the highway. What is the least amount
of fencing required for this job? How long and wide should the park be for the fenc-
ing to be minimized?
Solution
Step 1. Draw the picnic area, as in Figure 3.45. Let x (yards) be the length of the
park (the side parallel to the highway) and let y (yards) be the width.
Step 2. Since the park is to have area 5,000 square yards, we must have xy  5,000.
Step 3. The length of the fencing is F  x  2y, where x and y are both positive,
since otherwise there would be no park. Since
xy  5,000    or    y  5,000
x
Guidelines for Solving Optimization Problems
Step 1. Begin by deciding precisely what you want to maximize or minimize.
Once this has been done, assign names to all variables of interest. It
may help to pick letters that suggest the nature or role of the variable,
such as “R” for “revenue.”
Step 2. After assigning variables, express the relationships between the vari-
ables in terms of equations or inequalities. A ﬁgure may help.
Step 3. Express the quantity to be optimized (maximized or minimized) in
terms of just one variable (the independent variable). To do this, you
may need to use one or more of the available equations from step 2
to eliminate other variables. Also determine any necessary restrictions
on the independent variable.
Step 4. If f(x) is the quantity to be optimized, ﬁnd f (x) and determine all crit-
ical numbers of f. Then ﬁnd the required maximum or minimum value
using the methods of Section 3.4 (the extreme value theorem or the sec-
ond derivative test for absolute extrema). Remember, you may have to
check the value of f(x) at endpoints of an interval.
Step 5. Interpret your results in terms of appropriate physical, geometric, or
economic quantities.

we can eliminate y from the formula for F to obtain a formula in terms of x alone:
Step 4. The derivative of F(x) is
and we get the critical numbers for F(x) by setting F(x)  0 and solving for x:
equate the numerator to 0
reject 100 since x  0
Since x  100 is the only critical number in the interval x  0, we can apply the sec-
ond derivative test for absolute extrema. The second derivative of F(x) is
so F
(100)  0 and an absolute minimum of F(x) occurs where x  100. For refer-
ence, the graph of the fencing function F(x) is shown in Figure 3.46.
Step 5. We have shown the minimal amount of fencing is
which is achieved when the park is x  100 yards long and
wide.
EXAMPLE 3.5.2
A cylindrical can is to be constructed to hold a ﬁxed volume of liquid. The cost of
the material used for the top and bottom of the can is 3 cents per square inch, and
the cost of the material used for the curved side is 2 cents per square inch. Use cal-
culus to derive a simple relationship between the radius and height of the can that is
the least costly to construct.
Solution
Let r denote the radius, h the height, C the cost (in cents), and V the (ﬁxed) volume.
The goal is to minimize total cost, which comes from three sources:
Cost  cost of top  cost of bottom  cost of side

Before you can apply calculus, you must write the cost in terms of just one variable.
To do this, use the fact that the can is to have a ﬁxed volume V0 and solve the equation
V0 = r2h for h to get
Then substitute this expression for h into the formula for C to express the cost in
terms of r alone:
The radius r can be any positive number, so the goal is to ﬁnd the absolute min-
imum of C(r) for r  0. Differentiating C(r), you get
remember V0 is a constant
Since C(r) exists for all r  0, any critical number r  R must satisfy C(R) 0; that is,
If H is the height of the can that corresponds to the radius R, then V0 = r2H. Since

Finally, note that the second derivative of C(r) satisﬁes
Therefore, since r  R is the only critical number for C(r) and since C 
(R)  0, the
second derivative test for absolute extrema assures you that when the total cost of
constructing the can is minimized, the height of the can is three times its radius. The
graph of the cost function C(r) is shown in Figure 3.47.
EXAMPLE 3.5.3
A manufacturer can produce souvenir T-shirts at a cost of $2 apiece. The shirts have
been selling for $5 apiece, and at this price, tourists have been buying 4,000 shirts a
month. The manufacturer is planning to raise the price of the shirts and estimates that
for each $1 increase in the price, 400 fewer shirts will be sold each month. At what
price should the manufacturer sell the shirts to maximize proﬁt?
Solution
Let x denote the new price at which the shirts will be sold and P(x), the corre-
sponding proﬁt. The goal is to maximize the proﬁt. Begin by stating the formula for
proﬁt in words.
Proﬁt  (number of shirts sold)(proﬁt per shirt)
Since 4,000 shirts are sold each month when the price is $5 and 400 fewer will
be sold each month for each $1 increase in the price, it follows that
Number of shirts sold  4,000  400(number of $1 increases)
The number of $1 increases in the price is the difference x  5 between the new and
old selling prices. Hence,
Number of shirts sold  4,000  400(x  5)
 400[10  (x  5)]
 400(15  x)
The proﬁt per shirt is simply the difference between the selling price x and the cost
$2. That is,
Proﬁt per shirt  x  2
Putting it all together,
P(x)  400(15  x)(x  2)
The goal is to ﬁnd the absolute maximum of the proﬁt function P(x). To deter-
mine the relevant interval for this problem, note that since the new price x is to
be at least as high as the old price $5, we must have x  5. On the other hand,
the number of shirts sold is 400(15  x), which will be negative if x  15. If you
assume that the manufacturer will not price the shirts so high that no one buys
them, you can restrict the optimization problem to the closed interval 5 	 x 	 15.
To ﬁnd the critical numbers, compute the derivative using the product and con-
stant multiple rules to get
P(x)  400[(15  x)(1)  (x  2)(1)]
 400(15  x  x  2)  400(17  2x)

at the critical number and at the endpoints of the interval, you can conclude that the
maximum possible proﬁt is $16,900, which will be generated if the shirts are sold for
$8.50 apiece. For reference, the graph of the proﬁt function is shown in Figure 3.48.
FIGURE 3.48
The proﬁt function P(x)  400(15  x)(x  2).
NOTE
An Alternative Solution to the Proﬁt Maximization Problem in
Example 3.5.3
Since the number of shirts sold in Example 3.5.3 is described in terms of the
number N of $1 increases in price, you may wish to use N as the independent
variable in your solution rather than the new price itself. With this choice, you
ﬁnd that
Thus, the total proﬁt is
P(N)  (4,000  400N)(N  3)  400(10  N)(N  3)
and the relevant interval is 0 	 N 	 10. (Do you see why?) The absolute maxi-
mum in this case will occur when N  3.5 (provide the details); that is, when the
old price is increased from 5 to 5  3.5  8.5 dollars ($8.50). As you would
expect, this is the same as the result obtained using price as the independent vari-
able in Example 3.5.3.
■
In modern cities, where residential areas are often developed in the vicinity of
industrial plants, it is important to carefully monitor and control the emission of pol-
lutants. In Example 3.5.4, we examine a modeling problem in which calculus is used
to determine the location in a community where pollution is minimized.

EXAMPLE 3.5.4
Two industrial plants, A and B, are located 15 miles apart and emit 75 ppm (parts per
million) and 300 ppm of particulate matter, respectively. Each plant is surrounded by
a restricted area of radius 1 mile in which no housing is allowed, and the concentra-
tion of pollutant arriving at any other point Q from each plant decreases with the
reciprocal of the distance between that plant and Q. Where should a house be located
on a road joining the two plants to minimize the total pollution arriving from both
plants?
Solution
Suppose a house H is located x miles from plant A and hence, 15  x miles from
plant B, where x satisﬁes 1 	 x 	 14 since there is a 1-mile restricted area around each
plant (Figure 3.49). Since the concentration of particulate matter arriving at H from
each plant decreases with the reciprocal of the distance from the plant to H, the con-
centration of pollutant from plant A is 75x and from plant B is 300(15  x). Thus,
the total concentration of particulate matter arriving at H is given by the function

EXAMPLE 3.5.5
A cable is to be run from a power plant on one side of a river 900 meters wide to a
factory on the other side, 3,000 meters downstream. The cost of running the cable
under the water is $5 per meter, while the cost over land is $4 per meter. What is the
most economical route over which to run the cable?
Solution
To help you visualize the situation, begin by drawing a diagram as shown in Figure 3.50.
(Notice that in drawing the diagram in Figure 3.50, we have already assumed that the
cable should be run in a straight line from the power plant to some point P on the oppo-
site bank. Do you see why this assumption is justiﬁed?)
The goal is to minimize the cost of installing the cable. Let C denote this cost
and represent C as follows:
C  5(number of meters of cable under water) 
 4(number of meters of cable over land)
Since you wish to describe the optimal route over which to run the cable, it will
be convenient to choose a variable in terms of which you can easily locate the point
P. Two reasonable choices for the variable x are illustrated in Figure 3.51.
FIGURE 3.51
Two choices for the variable x.
Before plunging into the calculations, take a minute to decide which choice of vari-
ables is more advantageous. In Figure 3.51a, the distance across the water from the
power plant to the point P is (by the Pythagorean theorem) 
and the corresponding total cost function is

In Figure 3.51b, the distance across the water is 
and the total cost
function is
The second function is the more attractive since the term 3,000  x is merely
multiplied by 4, while in the ﬁrst function it is squared and appears under the radi-
cal. Hence, you should choose x as in Figure 3.51b and work with the total cost
function
Since the distances x and 3,000  x cannot be negative, the relevant interval is
0 	 x 	 3,000, and your goal is to ﬁnd the absolute minimum of the function C(x)
on this closed interval. To ﬁnd the critical values, compute the derivative
and set it equal to zero to get
Square both sides of the equation and solve for x to get
Since only the positive value x  1,200 is in the interval 0 	 x 	 3,000, com-
pute C(x) at this critical value and at the endpoints x  0 and x  3,000. Since
it follows that the minimal installation cost is $14,700, which will occur if the cable
reaches the opposite bank 1,200 meters downstream from the power plant.
In Example 3.5.6, the function to be maximized has practical meaning only when
its independent variable is a whole number. However, the optimization procedure
leads to a fractional value of this variable, and additional analysis is needed to obtain
a meaningful solution.

EXAMPLE 3.5.6
A bus company will charter a bus that holds 50 people to groups of 35 or more. If a
group contains exactly 35 people, each person pays $60. In large groups, everybody’s
fare is reduced by $1 for each person in excess of 35. Determine the size of the group
for which the bus company’s revenue will be greatest.
Solution
Let R denote the bus company’s revenue. Then,
R  (number of people in the group)(fare per person)
You could let x denote the total number of people in the group, but it is slightly more
convenient to let x denote the number of people in excess of 35. Then,
Number of people in the group  35  x
and
Fare per person  60  x
so the revenue function is
R(x)  (35  x)(60  x)
Since x represents the number of people in excess of 35 but less than 50, you
want to maximize R(x) for a positive integer x in the interval 0 	 x 	 15 (Fig-
ure 3.52a). However, to use the methods of calculus, consider the continuous function
R(x)  (35  x)(60  x) deﬁned on the entire interval 0 	 x 	 15 (Figure 3.52b).
FIGURE 3.52
The revenue function R(x)  (35  x)(60  x).
The derivative is
R(x)  (35  x)(1)  (60  x)(1)  25  2x
which is zero when x  12.5. Since
R(0)  2,100
R(12.5)  2,256.25
R(15)  2,250
it follows that the absolute maximum of R(x) on the interval 0 	 x 	 15 occurs when
x  12.5.

But x represents a certain number of people and must be a whole number. Hence,
x  12.5 cannot be the solution to this practical optimization problem. To ﬁnd the
optimal integer value of x, observe that R is increasing for 0  x  12.5 and decreas-
ing for x  12.5, as shown in this diagram (see also Figure 3.52b).
It follows that the optimal integer value of x is either x  12 or x  13. Since
R(12)  2,256
and
R(13)  2,256
you can conclude that the bus company’s revenue will be greatest when the group
contains either 12 or 13 people in excess of 35; that is, for groups of 47 or 48. The
revenue in either case will be $2,256.
Inventory control is an important consideration in business. In particular, for each ship-
ment of raw materials, a manufacturer must pay an ordering fee to cover handling and
transportation. When the raw materials arrive, they must be stored until needed, and
storage costs result. If each shipment of raw materials is large, few shipments will be
needed, so ordering costs will be low, while storage costs will be high. On the other
hand, if each shipment is small, ordering costs will be high because many shipments
will be needed, but storage costs will be low. Example 3.5.7 shows how the methods
of calculus can be used to determine the shipment size that minimizes total cost.
EXAMPLE 3.5.7
A bicycle manufacturer buys 6,000 tires a year from a distributor. The ordering fee
is $20 per shipment, the storage cost is 96 cents per tire per year, and each tire costs
$21. Suppose that the tires are used at a constant rate throughout the year and that
each shipment arrives just as the preceding shipment is being used up. How many
tires should the manufacturer order each time to minimize cost?
Solution
The goal is to minimize the total cost, which can be written as
Total cost  storage cost  ordering cost  purchase cost
Let x denote the number of tires in each shipment and C(x) the corresponding total
cost in dollars. Then,
Ordering cost  (ordering cost per shipment)(number of shipments)
Since 6,000 tires are ordered during the year and each shipment contains x tires, the
number of shipments is 
and so
Ordering cost  20

Moreover,
Purchase cost  (total number of tires ordered)(cost per tire)
 6,000(21)  126,000
The storage cost is slightly more complicated. When a shipment arrives, all x tires
are placed in storage and then withdrawn for use at a constant rate. The inventory
decreases linearly until there are no tires left, at which time the next shipment arrives.
The situation is illustrated in Figure 3.53a. This is sometimes called just-in-time
inventory management.
FIGURE 3.53
Inventory graphs.
The average number of tires in storage during the year is , and the total yearly 
storage cost is the same as if 
tires were kept in storage for the entire year (Figure 3.53b). 
This assertion, although reasonable, is not really obvious, and you have every right
to be unconvinced. In Chapter 5, you will learn how to prove this fact mathemati-
cally using integral calculus. It follows that
Storage cost  (average number of tires stored)(storage cost per tire)
Putting it all together, the total cost is

which is zero when
Since x  500 is the only critical number in the relevant interval 0  x 	 6,000,
you can apply the second derivative test for absolute extrema. You ﬁnd that the
second derivative of the cost function is
which is positive when x  0. Hence, the absolute minimum of the total cost C(x) on
the interval 0  x 	 6,000 occurs when x  500; that is, when the manufacturer
orders the tires in lots of 500. For reference, the graph of the total cost function is
sketched in Figure 3.54.
NOTE
Since the derivative of the (constant) purchase price $126,000 in Exam-
ple 3.5.7 was zero, this component of the total cost had no bearing on the opti-
mization problem. In general, economists distinguish between ﬁxed costs (such
as the total purchase price) and variable costs (such as the storage and ordering
costs). To minimize total cost, it is sufﬁcient to minimize the sum of all the vari-
able components of cost.

40. TRANSPORTATION COST
For speeds 
between 40 and 65 miles per hour, a truck gets 
miles per gallon when driven at a constant 
speed of x miles per hour. Diesel gasoline costs
$3.90 per gallon, and the driver is paid $19.50 per
hour. What is the most economical constant speed
between 40 and 65 miles per hour at which to
drive the truck?
41. AVIAN BEHAVIOR
Homing pigeons will rarely
ﬂy over large bodies of water unless forced to do
so, presumably because it requires more energy to
maintain altitude in ﬂight in the heavy air over
cool water.* Suppose a pigeon is released from a
boat B ﬂoating on a lake 5 miles from a point A
on the shore and 13 miles from the pigeon’s loft
L, as shown in the accompanying ﬁgure.
Assuming the pigeon requires twice as much
energy to ﬂy over water as over land, what path
should it follow to minimize the total energy
expended in ﬂying from the boat to its loft?
Assume the shoreline is straight and describe your
path as a line from B to a point P on the shore
followed by a line from P to L.

43. CONSTRUCTION
The stiffness of a rectangular
beam is proportional to the product of its width w
and the cube of its depth h. Find the dimensions of
the stiffest beam that can be cut from a wooden
log of diameter 15 inches. (Note the accompanying
ﬁgure.)
EXERCISE 43
44. TRANSPORTATION COST
A truck is hired
to transport goods from a factory to a warehouse.
The driver’s wages are ﬁgured by the hour and
so are inversely proportional to the speed at
which the truck is driven. The amount of
gasoline used is directly proportional to the
speed at which the truck is driven, and the price
of gasoline remains constant during the trip.
Show that the total cost is smallest at the speed
for which the driver’s wages are equal to the
cost of the gasoline used.
45. URBAN PLANNING
Two industrial plants, A
and B, are located 18 miles apart, and each day,
respectively emit 80 ppm (parts per million) and
720 ppm of particulate matter. Plant A is
surrounded by a restricted area of radius 1 mile,
while the restricted area around plant B has a
radius of 2 miles. The concentration of particulate
matter arriving at any other point Q from each
plant decreases with the reciprocal of the distance
between that plant and Q. Where should a house
be located on a road joining the two plants to
minimize the total concentration of particulate
matter arriving from both plants?

URBAN PLANNING
In Exercise 45, suppose
the concentration of particulate matter arriving
at a point Q from each plant decreases with the
reciprocal of the square of the distance between
that plant and Q. With this alteration, now
where should a house be located to minimize the
total concentration of particulate matter arriving
from both plants?

OPTIMAL SETUP COST
Suppose that at a
certain factory, setup cost is directly proportional
to the number N of machines used and operating
cost is inversely proportional to N. Show that
when the total cost is minimal, the setup cost is
equal to the operating cost.
48. AVERAGE PRODUCTIVITY
The output Q at
a certain factory is a function of the number L of
worker-hours of labor that are used. Use calculus
to prove that when the average output per worker-
hour is greatest, the average output is equal to
the marginal output per worker-hour. You may
assume without proof that the critical point of
the average output function is actually the
desired absolute maximum. [Hint: The marginal
output per worker-hour is the derivative of
output Q with respect to labor L.] 
49. INSTALLATION COST
For the summer, the
company installing the cable in Example 3.5.5
has hired Frank Kornercutter as a consultant.
Frank, recalling a problem from ﬁrst-year calculus,
asserts that no matter how far downstream the
factory is located (beyond 1,200 meters), it
would be most economical to have the cable
reach the opposite bank 1,200 meters downstream
from the power plant. The supervisor, amused by
Frank’s naivete, replies, “Any fool can see that if
the factory is farther away, the cable should
reach the opposite bank farther downstream. It’s
just common sense!” Of course, Frank is no
common fool, but is he right? Why?

51. PRODUCTION COST
A manufacturing ﬁrm
receives an order for q units of a certain
commodity. Each of the ﬁrm’s machines can
produce n units per hour. The setup cost is s
dollars per machine, and the operating cost is p
dollars per hour.
a. Derive a formula for the number of machines
that should be used to keep total cost as low as
possible.
b. Prove that when the total cost is minimal, the
cost of setting up the machines is equal to the
cost of operating the machines.

INVENTORY
The inventory model analyzed in
Example 3.5.7 is not the only such model possible.
Suppose a company must supply N units per time
period at a uniform rate. Assume that the storage
cost per unit is D1 dollars per time period and that
the setup (ordering) cost is D2 dollars. If production
is at a uniform rate of m units per time period 
(with no items in inventory at the end of each
period), it can be shown that the total storage cost is 
where x is the number of items produced in each run.
a. Show that the total average cost per period is
b. Find an expression for the number of items
that should be produced in each run in order 
to minimize the total average cost per time
period.

c. The optimum quantity found in the inventory
problem in Example 3.5.7 is sometimes called
the economic order quantity (EOQ), while
the optimum found in part (b) of this exercise
is called the economic production quantity
(EPQ). Modern inventory management goes
far beyond the simple conditions in the EOQ
and EPQ models, but elements of these
models are still very important. For instance,
the just-in-time inventory management
described in Example 3.5.7 ﬁts well with the
production philosophy of the Japanese. Read
an article on Japanese production methods and
write a paragraph on why the Japanese regard
using space for the storage of materials as
undesirable.*
53. EFFECT OF TAXATION ON A MONOPOLY
A monopolist is a manufacturer who can
manipulate the price of a commodity and usually
does so with an eye toward maximizing proﬁt.
When the government taxes output, the tax
effectively becomes an additional cost item, and
the monopolist is forced to decide how much of
the tax to absorb and how much to pass on to the
consumer.
Suppose a particular monopolist estimates that
when x units are produced, the total cost will be 
dollars and the market 
price of the commodity will be 
dollars per unit. Further assume that the
government imposes a tax of t dollars on each
unit produced.

consumer?

paragraph on how it affects consumer

54. ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
Tom requires
$10,000 spending money each year, which he
takes from his savings account by making 
N equal withdrawals. Each withdrawal incurs a
transaction fee of $8, and money in his account
earns interest at the simple interest rate of 4%.
a. The total cost C of managing the account 
is the transaction cost plus the loss of interest
due to withdrawn funds. Express C as a 
function of N. [Hint: You may need the fact 
that 1  2  . . .  N  N(N  1)/2.]

cost C(N)?

Oil from an offshore
rig located 3 miles from the shore is to be pumped
to a location on the edge of the shore that is 8 miles
east of the rig. The cost of constructing a pipe in the
ocean from the rig to the shore is 1.5 times more
expensive than the cost of construction on land.
How should the pipe be laid to minimize cost?
47. INVENTORY
Through its franchised stations, an
oil company gives out 16,000 road maps per year.
The cost of setting up a press to print the maps is
$100 for each production run. In addition,
production costs are 6 cents per map and storage
costs are 20 cents per map per year. The maps are
distributed at a uniform rate throughout the year and
are printed in equal batches timed so that each
arrives just as the preceding batch has been used up.
How many maps should the oil company print in
each batch to minimize cost?

A fundamental problem
in crystallography is the determination of the
packing fraction of a crystal lattice, which is the
fraction of space occupied by the atoms in the
lattice, assuming that the atoms are hard spheres.
When the lattice contains exactly two different
kinds of atoms, it can be shown that the packing
fraction is given by the formula*
where 
is the ratio of the radii, r and R, of 
the two kinds of atoms in the lattice, and c and K
are positive constants.

An experimental garden plot contains
N annual plants, each of which produces S seeds
that are dropped within the same plot. A botanical
model measures the number of offspring plants
A(N) that survive until the next year by the
function
where c and p are positive constants.

Certain hazardous waste products have the
property that as the concentration of substrate (the
substance undergoing change by enzymatic action)
increases, there is a toxic inhibition effect. A
mathematical model for this behavior is the
Haldane equation*
where R is the speciﬁc growth rate of the
substance (the rate at which cells divide); S is the
substrate concentration; and a, b, and c are
positive constants.
a. Sketch the graph of R(S). Does the graph appear
to have a highest point? A lowest point? A point
of inﬂection? What happens to the growth rate
as S grows larger and larger? Interpret your
observations.

55. URBAN CRIME
A study† of urban crime in
Detroit published in 1977 indicated that the
average number of monthly property crimes N1
and personal crimes (such as rape or murder) N2
were related to the retail price of heroin p (dollars
per gram) by the equations
N1  3,351p0.287
and
N2  207.8p0.349
For simplicity, we assume that there is no overlap
between the two kinds of crime.
a. Find the elasticity of N1 with respect to p. By
what approximate percentage do property
crimes N1 increase if the price of heroin rises by

b. Answer the questions in part (a) for personal
crimes N2.

the elasticity of N with respect to p and use it
to estimate the percentage of increase in total
crime to be expected if the price of heroin in-

The total number of deaths from AIDS in the United States each year from 1989 to 2001 is shown in the table.

Year
United States AIDS Deaths
The goal in modeling the number of AIDS deaths in the United States per year
is to ﬁnd a relatively simple function f(t) that provides a close approximation to the
number of AIDS deaths in the United States, in the year t after the year 1989. One
MODELING AN EPIDEMIC: DEATHS DUE 
TO AIDS IN THE UNITED STATES
Mathematical models are used extensively to study infectious disease. In particular,
during the past 20 years, many different mathematical models for the number of
deaths from AIDS per year have been developed. In this essay, we will describe some
of the simplest such models and discuss their accuracy. Before doing so, however, we
will provide some background.
From 1980 until 1995, the number of people dying from AIDS in the United
States increased rapidly from close to zero to more than 51,000. In the mid-1990s it
appeared that the number of these deaths would continue to increase each year. How-
ever, with the advent of new treatments and drugs, the number of annual deaths from
AIDS in the United States has steadily decreased, with less than 16,000 such deaths
reported in 2001. That said, the future trend for the total number of annual AIDS
deaths in the United States is not clear. The virus that causes AIDS has developed
resistance to some of the drugs that have been effective in treating it, and in addition,
there are indications that many susceptible people are not taking adequate precautions
to prevent the spread of the disease. Will these factors result in an increase in AIDS-
related deaths, or will the many new drugs currently being developed result in a con-
tinuation of the current downward trend?

of the simplest approaches to construct such functions is to use polynomial regres-
sion, a technique that produces best-ﬁt polynomials of speciﬁed degree that are good
approximations to observed data. When using polynomial regression, we ﬁrst need to
specify the degree of the polynomial we want to use to approximate the number of
AIDS deaths per year in the United States. The higher the degree, the better the
approximation, but the more complicated the function. Suppose we decide to use a
polynomial of degree 3, so that f(t) has the general form f(t)  at3  bt2  ct  d.
The coefﬁcients a, b, c, and d of the best-ﬁtting cubic curve we seek are then deter-
mined by requiring the sum of squares of the vertical distances between data points
in the table and corresponding points on the cubic polynomial y  f(t) to be as small
as possible. Calculus methods for carrying out this optimization procedure are devel-
oped in Section 7.4. In practice, however, regression polynomials are almost always
found using a computer or graphing calculator. There is a detailed description of how
to use your calculator for ﬁnding regression polynomials in the Calculator Introduc-
tion on the textbook’s website, www.mhhe.com/hoffmann.
It is important to realize that there are no underlying biological reasons why a
polynomial should provide a good approximation to the number of AIDS deaths in
the United States during a year. Nevertheless, we begin with such models because
they are easy to construct. More sophisticated models, including some that are based
on biological reasoning, can be constructed using exponential functions studied in
Chapter 4.

Exponential Functions; Continuous Compounding
A population Q(t) is said to grow exponentially if whenever it is measured at equally
spaced time intervals, the population at the end of any particular interval is a ﬁxed
multiple (greater than 1) of the population at the end of the previous interval. For
instance, according to the United Nations, in the year 2000, the population of the
world was 6.1 billion people and was growing at an annual rate of about 1.4%. If this
pattern were to continue, then every year, the population would be 1.014 times the
population of the previous year. Thus, if P(t) is the world population (in billions) t
years after the base year 2000, the population would grow as follows:
2000
P(0)  6.1
2001
P(1)  6.1(1.014)  6.185
2002
P(2)  6.185(1.014)  [6.1(1.014)](1.014)  6.1(1.014)2  6.272
2003
P(3)  6.272(1.014)  [6.1(1.014)2](1.014)  6.1(1.014)3  6.360
2000  t
P(t)  6.1(1.014)t
The graph of P(t) is shown in Figure 4.1a. Notice that according to this model,
the world population grows gradually at ﬁrst but doubles after about 50 years (to
12.22 billion in 2050).
FIGURE 4.1
Two models for population growth.
Exponential population models are sometimes referred to as Malthusian, after
Thomas Malthus (1766–1834), a British economist who predicted mass starvation
would result if a population grows exponentially while the food supply grows at a con-
stant rate (linearly). Fortunately, world population does not continue to grow expo-
nentially as predicted by Malthus’s model, and models that take into account various
restrictions on the growth rate actually provide more accurate predictions. The popula-
tion curve that results from one such model, the so-called logistic model, is shown in
Figure 4.1b. Note how the logistic growth curve rises steeply at ﬁrst, like an exponen-
tial curve, but then eventually turns over and ﬂattens out as environmental factors act
to brake the growth rate. We will examine logistic curves in Section 4.4 (Example 4.4.6)
and again in Chapter 6 as part of a more detailed study of population models.

logistic growth and a variety of other important quantities. For instance, exponential
functions are used in demography to forecast population size, in ﬁnance to calculate
the value of investments, in archaeology to date ancient artifacts, in psychology to
study learning patterns, and in industry to estimate the reliability of products.
In this section, we will explore the properties of exponential functions and intro-
duce a few basic models in which such functions play a prominent role. Additional
applications such as the logistic model are examined in subsequent sections.
Working with exponential functions requires the use of exponential notation
and the algebraic laws of exponents. Solved examples and practice problems
involving this notation can be found in Appendix A1. Here is a brief summary of

as

that irrational numbers can be approximated by rational numbers, which in turn implies
there is only one unbroken curve passing through all points (r, br) for r rational. In other
words, there exists a unique continuous function f(x) that is deﬁned for all real numbers

Students often confuse the power function p(x)  xb with the exponen-

exponent b is constant, while in bx, the base b is constant and the variable x is
the exponent. The graphs of y  x2 and y  2x are shown in Figure 4.4. Notice
that after the crossover point (4, 16), the exponential curve y  2x rises much
more steeply than the power curve y  x2. For instance, when x  10, the y value
on the power curve is y  102  100, while the corresponding y value on the

where t is the number of minutes after observation begins. What is the average rate
of change of the bacterial population during the second hour?
Solution
During the second hour (from time t  60 to t  120), the population changes by
P(120)  P(60), so the average rate of change during this time period is given by
Thus, the population increases at the average rate of roughly 299 bacteria per minute
during the second hour.
The number e is called the “natural exponential base,” but it may seem anything but
“natural” to you. As an illustration of how this number appears in practical situations,
we use it to describe the accounting practice known as continuous compounding of
interest.
First, let us review the basic ideas behind compound interest. Suppose a sum of
money is invested and the interest is compounded only once. If P is the initial invest-
ment (the principal) and r is the interest rate (expressed as a decimal), the balance B
after the interest is added will be
B  P  Pr  P(1  r)
dollars
That is, to compute the balance at the end of an interest period, you multiply the bal-
ance at the beginning of the period by the expression 1  r.
At most banks, interest is compounded more than once a year. The interest that
is added to the account during one period will itself earn interest during the subse-
quent periods. If the annual interest rate is r and interest is compounded k times per
year, then the year is divided into k equal compounding periods and the interest rate 
in each period is . Hence, the balance at the end of the ﬁrst period is

and, in general, the balance at the end of the mth period is
Since there are k periods in a year, the balance after 1 year is
At the end of t years, interest has been compounded kt times and the balance is given
by the function
As the frequency with which interest is compounded increases, the corre-
sponding balance B(t) also increases. Hence, a bank that compounds interest fre-
quently may attract more customers than one that offers the same interest rate but
compounds interest less often. But what happens to the balance at the end of t
years as the compounding frequency increases without bound? More specifically,
what will the balance be at the end of t years if interest is compounded not quar-
terly, not monthly, not daily, but continuously? In mathematical terms, this 
question is equivalent to asking what happens to the expression 
as k
increases without bound. The answer turns out to involve the number e. Here is the 
argument.
To simplify the calculation, let 
. Then, k  nr and so
Since n increases without bound as k does, and since 
approaches e as n
increases without bound, it follows that the balance after t years is

Suppose $1,000 is invested at an annual interest rate of 6%. Compute the balance
after 10 years if the interest is compounded
a. Quarterly
b. Monthly
c. Daily
d. Continuously
Solution
a. To compute the balance after 10 years if the interest is compounded quarterly, 
use the formula 
, with t  10, P  1,000, r  0.06, and k  4:
b. This time, take t  10, P  1,000, r  0.06, and k  12 to get
c. Take t  10, P  1,000, r  0.06, and k  365 to obtain
d. For continuously compounded interest use the formula B(t)  Pert, with t  10,
P  1,000, and r  0.06:
B(10)  1,000e0.6  $1,822.12
This value, $1,822.12, is an upper bound for the possible balance. No matter how
often interest is compounded, $1,000 invested at an annual interest rate of 6% can-
not grow to more than $1,822.12 in 10 years.
In many situations, it is useful to know how much money P must be invested at a
ﬁxed compound interest rate in order to obtain a desired accumulated (future) value
B over a given period of time T. This investment P is called the present value of the
amount B to be received in T years. Present value may be regarded as a measure
of the current worth of an investment and is used by economists to compare differ-
ent investment possibilities.
To derive a formula for present value, we need only solve an appropriate future
value formula for P. In particular, if the investment is compounded k times per year
at an annual rate r for the term of T years, then
and the present value of B dollars in T years is obtained by multiplying both sides of 
the equation by

Sue is about to enter college. When she graduates 4 years from now, she wants to
take a trip to Europe that she estimates will cost $5,000. How much should she invest
now at 7% to have enough for the trip if interest is compounded:
a. Quarterly
b. Continuously
Solution
The required future value is B  $5,000 in T  4 years with r  0.07.
a. If the compounding is quarterly, then k  4 and the present value is
b. For continuous compounding, the present value is
P  5,000e0.07(4)  $3,778.92
Thus, Sue would have to invest about $9 more if interest is compounded quarterly
than if the compounding is continuous.
Which is better, an investment that earns 10% compounded quarterly, one that earns
9.95% compounded monthly, or one that earns 9.9% compounded continuously? One
way to answer this question is to determine the simple annual interest rate that is
equivalent to each investment. This is known as the effective interest rate, and it can
be easily obtained from the compound interest formulas.
Suppose interest is compounded k times per year at the annual rate r. This is
called the nominal rate of interest. Then the balance at the end of 1 year is

intensity I0 will have intensity I at a depth of x
meters, where I  I0ekx with k  0. The constant
k, called the absorption coefﬁcient, depends on
the wavelength of the light and the density of the
water. Suppose a beam of sunlight is only 10% as
intense at a depth of 3 meters as at the surface.
How intense is the beam at a depth of 1 meter?

TRUTH IN LENDING
You are selling your car
for $6,000. A potential buyer says, “I will pay you
$1,000 now for the car and pay off the rest at
12% interest with monthly payments for 3 years.
Let’s see . . . 12% of the $5,000 is $600 and
$5,600 divided by 36 months is $155.56, but I’ll
pay you $160 per month for the trouble of
carrying the loan. Is it a deal?”
a. If this deal sounds fair to you, I have a perfectly
lovely bridge I think you should consider as
your next purchase. If not, explain why the deal
is ﬁshy and compute a fair monthly payment
(assuming you still plan to amortize the debt of
$5,000 over 3 years at 12%).
b. Read an article on truth in lending and think up
some examples of plausible yet shady deals,
such as the proposed used-car transaction in this

Logarithmic Functions
Suppose you invest $1,000 at 8% compounded continuously and wish to know how
much time must pass for your investment to double in value to $2,000. According to
the formula derived in Section 4.1, the value of your account after t years will be
1,000e0.08t, so to ﬁnd the doubling time for your account, you must solve for t in the
equation
1,000e0.08t  2,000
or, by dividing both sides by 1,000,
e0.08t  2
We will answer the question about doubling time in Example 4.2.10. Solving
an exponential equation such as this involves using logarithms, which reverse the
process of exponentiation. Logarithms play an important role in a variety of appli-
cations, such as measuring the capacity of a transmission channel and in the famous
Richter scale for measuring earthquake intensity. In this section, we examine the
basic properties of logarithmic functions and a few applications. We begin with a
deﬁnition.

■
Let b be any logarithmic base (b  0, b  1). Then
logb 1  0
and
logb b  1
and if u and v are any positive numbers, we have
The equality rule
logb u  logb v
if and only if u  v
The product rule
logb (uv)  logb u  logb v
The power rule
logb ur  r logb u
for any real number r
The quotient rule
The inversion rule
logb bu  u
logb 

All these logarithmic rules follow from corresponding exponential rules. For
example,
logb 1  0
since
b0  1
logb b  1
since
b1  b
To prove the equality rule, let
m  logb u
and
n  logb v
so that by deﬁnition,
bm  u
and
bn  v
Therefore, if
logb u  logb v
then m  n, so
bm  bn
or, equivalently,
u  v
as stated in the equality rule for logarithms. Similarly, to prove the product rule for
logarithms, note that
Proofs of the power rule and the quotient rule are left as exercises (see Exercise 78).

There is an easy way to obtain the graph of the logarithmic function y  logb x from
the graph of the exponential function y  bx. The idea is that since y  logb x is equiv-
alent to x  b y, the graph of y  logb x is the same as the graph of y  bx with the
roles of x and y reversed. That is, if (u, v) is a point on the curve y  logb x, then
v  logbu, or equivalently, u  bv, which means that (v, u) is on the graph of y  bx.
As illustrated in Figure 4.5a, the points (u, v) and (v, u) are mirror images of one
another in the line y  x (see Exercise 79). Thus, the graph of y  logb x can be

The logarithmic function
has these properties:
1. It is deﬁned and continuous for all x  0.
2. The y axis is a vertical asymptote.
3. The x intercept is (1, 0); there is no y intercept.
4. If b  1, then

To evaluate ln a for a particular number a  0, use the LN key on your calcu-

Solution
a. According to the deﬁnition, ln e is the unique number c such that e  ec. Clearly
this number is c  1. Hence, ln e  1.
b. ln 1 is the unique number c such that 1  ec. Since e0  1, it follows that 
ln 1  0.

Two functions f and g with the property that f(g(x))  x and g( f(x))  x, when-

EXAMPLE 4.2.8
The population density x miles from the center of a city is given by a function of
the form Q(x)  Aekx. Find this function if it is known that the population density
at the center of the city is 15,000 people per square mile and the density 10 miles
from the center is 9,000 people per square mile.
Solution
For simplicity, express the density in units of 1,000 people per square mile. The fact
that Q(0)  15 tells you that A  15. The fact that Q(10)  9 means that
Taking the logarithm of each side of this equation, you get
Hence the exponential function for the population density is Q(x)  15e0.051x.

In the introductory paragraph at the beginning of this section, you were asked how
long it would take for a particular investment to double in value. This question is
answered in Example 4.2.10.
EXAMPLE 4.2.10
If $1,000 is invested at 8% annual interest, compounded continuously, how long will
it take for the investment to double? Would the doubling time change if the principal
were something other than $1,000?
Solution
With a principal of $1,000, the balance after t years is B(t)  1,000e0.08t, so the invest-
ment doubles when B(t)  $2,000; that is, when
2,000  1,000e0.08t
Dividing by 1,000 and taking the natural logarithm on each side of the equation, we get
If the principal had been P0 dollars instead of $1,000, the doubling time would
satisfy
which is exactly the same equation we had with P0  $1,000, so once again, the dou-
bling time is 8.66 years.
The situation illustrated in Example 4.2.10 applies to any quantity Q(t)  Q0ekt

Determining the time it takes for an investment to double is just one of several
issues an investor may address when comparing various investment opportunities.
Two additional issues are illustrated in Examples 4.2.11 and 4.2.12.

EXAMPLE 4.2.12
An investor has $1,500 and wishes it to grow to $2,000 in 5 years. At what annual
rate r compounded continuously must he invest to achieve this goal?
Solution
If the interest rate is r, the future value of $1,500 in 5 years is given by 1,500 er(5).
In order for this to equal $2,000, we must have
Taking natural logarithms on both sides of this equation, we get
so
The annual interest rate is approximately 5.75%.
It has been experimentally determined that a radioactive sample of initial size Q0
grams will decay to Q(t)  Q0ekt grams in t years. The positive constant k in this
formula measures the rate of decay, but this rate is usually given by specifying the
amount of time t  h required for half a given sample to decay. This time h is
called the half-life of the radioactive substance. Example 4.2.13 shows how half-
life is related to k.

Thus, the half-life is
as required.
In 1960, W. F. Libby won a Nobel prize for his discovery of carbon dating, a
technique for determining the age of certain fossils and artifacts. Here is an outline
of the technique.*
The carbon dioxide in the air contains the radioactive isotope 14C (carbon-14) as
well as the stable isotope 12C (carbon-12). Living plants absorb carbon dioxide from
the air, which means that the ratio of 14C to 12C in a living plant (or in an animal that
eats plants) is the same as that in the air itself. When a plant or an animal dies, the
absorption of carbon dioxide ceases. The 12C already in the plant or animal remains
the same as at the time of death while the 14C decays, and the ratio of 14C to 12C
decreases exponentially. It is reasonable to assume that the ratio R0 of 14C to 12C in
the atmosphere is the same today as it was in the past, so that the ratio of 14C to 12C
in a sample (e.g., a fossil or an artifact) is given by a function of the form R(t)  R0ekt.
The half-life of 14C is 5,730 years. By comparing R(t) to R0, archaeologists can esti-
mate the age of the sample. Example 4.2.14 illustrates the dating procedure.
EXAMPLE 4.2.14
An archaeologist has found a fossil in which the ratio of 14C to 12C is 
the ratio
found in the atmosphere. Approximately how old is the fossil?
Solution
The age of the fossil is the value of t for which

ART FORGERY
A forged painting allegedly
painted by Rembrandt in 1640 is found to have
99.7% of its original 14C. When was it actually
painted? What percentage of the original 14C
should remain if it were legitimate?
62.
ARCHAEOLOGY
In 1389, Pierre d’Arcis, 
the bishop of Troyes, wrote a memo to the pope,
accusing a colleague of passing off “a certain
cloth, cunningly painted,” as the burial shroud
of Jesus Christ. Despite this early testimony of
forgery, the image on the cloth is so compelling
that many people regard it as a sacred relic.
Known as the Shroud of Turin, the cloth was
subjected to carbon dating in 1988. If authentic,
the cloth would have been approximately 1,960
years old at that time.
a. If the Shroud were actually 1,960 years old,
what percentage of the 14C would have 
remained?
b. Scientists determined that 92.3% of the
Shroud’s original 14C remained. Based on this
information alone, what was the likely age of
the Shroud in 1988?

COOLING
Instant coffee is made by adding
boiling water (212°F) to coffee mix. If the air
temperature is 70°F, Newton’s law of cooling
says that after t minutes, the temperature of the
coffee will be given by a function of the form
f(t)  70  Aekt. After cooling for 2 minutes,
the coffee is still 15°F too hot to drink, but 2
minutes later it is just right. What is this “ideal”
temperature for drinking?

DEMOGRAPHICS
The world’s population
grows at the rate of approximately 2% per year.
If it is assumed that the population growth is
exponential, then the population t years from
now will be given by a function of the form 
P(t)  P0e0.02t, where P0 is the current
population. (This formula is derived in Chapter
6.) Assuming that this model of population
growth is correct, how long will it take for the
world’s population to double?

SPY STORY
Having ransomed his superior in 
Exercise 19 of Section 3.5, the spy returns home,
only to learn that his best friend, Sigmund
(“Siggy”) Leiter, has been murdered. The police
say that Siggy’s body was discovered at 1 P.M. on
Thursday, stuffed in a freezer where the
temperature was 10°F. He is also told that the
temperature of the corpse at the time of discovery
was 40°F, and he remembers that t hours after
death a body has temperature
T  Ta  (98.6  Ta)(0.97)t
where Ta is the air temperature adjacent to the
body. The spy knows the dark deed was done by
either Ernst Stavro Blohardt or André Scélérat. If
Blohardt was in jail until noon on Wednesday 
and Scélérat was seen in Las Vegas from noon
Wednesday until Friday, who “iced” Siggy, 
and when?

the difference in loudness is D decibels, where
When sound is rated in relation to the threshold of
human hearing (I0  1012), the level of normal
conversation is about 60 decibels, while a rock
concert may be 50 times as loud (110 decibels).

Differentiation of Exponential

In the examples and exercises examined so far in this chapter we have seen how expo-
nential functions can be used to model a variety of situations, ranging from compound
interest to population growth and radioactive decay. In order to discuss rates of change
and to determine extreme values in such situations, we need derivative formulas for
exponential functions and their logarithmic counterparts. We obtain the formulas in this
section and examine a few basic applications. Additional exponential and logarithmic
models will be explored in Section 4.4. We begin by showing that the natural expo-
nential function f(x)  ex has the remarkable property of being its own derivative.

a. Find the revenue and marginal revenue functions.
b. Use marginal analysis to estimate the revenue obtained from producing the ﬁfth
unit. What is the actual revenue obtained from producing the ﬁfth unit?
Solution
a. The revenue is
R(x)  xp(x)  x(112  x ln x3)  112x  x2(3 ln x)
hundred dollars, and the marginal revenue is
b. The revenue obtained from producing the ﬁfth unit is estimated by the marginal
revenue evaluated at x  4; that is, by
R(4)  112  3(4)  6(4) ln(4)  66.73
Thus, marginal analysis suggests that the manufacturer will receive approximately
66.73 hundred dollars ($6,673) in revenue by producing the additional unit. The
actual revenue obtained by producing the ﬁfth unit is
R(5)  R(4)  [112(5)  3(5)2 ln 5]  [112(4)  3(4)2 ln 4]
 439.29  381.46  57.83
hundred dollars ($5,783).
In Example 4.3.12, we examine exponential demand and use marginal analysis
to determine the price at which the revenue associated with such demand is maxi-
mized. Part of the example deals with the concept of elasticity of demand, which was
introduced in Section 3.4.
EXAMPLE 4.3.12
A manufacturer determines that D( p)  5,000e0.02p units of a particular commodity
will be demanded (sold) when the price is p dollars per unit.
a. Find the elasticity of demand for this commodity. For what values of p is the
demand elastic, inelastic, and of unit elasticity?
b. If the price is increased by 3% from $40, what is the expected effect on demand?
c. Find the revenue R(p) obtained by selling q  D( p) units at p dollars per unit.
For what value of p is the revenue maximized?
Solution
a. According to the formula derived in Section 3.4, the elasticity of demand is given by

You ﬁnd that
so
demand is of unit elasticity when E(p)  0.02p  1; that is, when p  50
demand is elastic when E(p)  0.02p  1; or p  50
demand is inelastic when E(p)  0.02p  1; or p  50
The graph of the demand function, showing levels of elasticity, is displayed in Figure 4.8a.
FIGURE 4.8
Demand and revenue curves for the commodity in Example 4.3.12.
b. When p  40, the demand is
q(40)  5,000e0.02(40)  2,247 units
and the elasticity of demand is
E( p)  0.02(40)  0.8
Thus, an increase of 1% in price from p  $40 will result in a decrease in the quantity
demanded by approximately 0.8%. Consequently, an increase of 3% in price, from
$40 to $41.20, results in a decrease in demand of approximately 2,247[3(0.008)] 
54 units, from 2,247 to 2,193 units.
c. The revenue function is
R(p)  pq  5,000pe0.02p
for p  0 (only nonnegative prices have economic meaning), with derivative
R( p)  5,000(0.02pe0.02p  e0.02p)
 5,000(1  0.02p)e0.02p
Since e0.02p is always positive, R(p)  0 if and only if
1  0.02p  0
or
p 

To verify that p  50 actually gives the absolute maximum, note that

EXPLORE!
Based on Example 4.3.12,
store the function y  AxeBx
in Y1 of the equation editor.
For different values of A and B
ﬁnd the location of the
maximum of y in terms of
A and B. For example, set
A  1 and then vary the value
of B (say, 1, 0.5, and 0.1) to
see where the maximal
functional value occurs. Then
ﬁx B at 0.1 and let A vary
(say, 1, 10, 100). Make a
conjecture about the location
of the maximal y value in
this case.

so
R(50)  5,000[0.0004(50)  0.04]e0.02(50)  37  0
Thus, the second derivative test tells you that the absolute maximum of R(p) does
indeed occur when p  50 (Figure 4.8b).
Differentiating a function that involves products, quotients, or powers can often be
simpliﬁed by ﬁrst taking the logarithm of the function. This technique, called
logarithmic differentiation, is illustrated in Example 4.3.13.
EXAMPLE 4.3.13
Differentiate the function 
.
Solution
You could ﬁnd the derivative using the quotient rule and the chain rule, but the result-
ing computation would be somewhat tedious. (Try it!)
A more efﬁcient approach is to take logarithms of both sides of the expression
for f:
Notice that by introducing the logarithm, you eliminate the quotient, the cube root,
and the fourth power.
Now use the chain rule for logarithms to differentiate both sides of this equation
to get
so that
If Q(x) is a differentiable function of x, note that
where the ratio on the right is the relative rate of change of Q(x). That is, the rela-
tive rate of change of a quantity Q(x) can be computed by ﬁnding the derivative of
ln Q. This special kind of logarithmic differentiation can be used to simplify the com-
putation of various growth rates, as illustrated in Example 4.3.14.

EXAMPLE 4.3.14
A country exports three goods, wheat W, steel S, and oil O. Suppose at a particu-
lar time t  t0, the revenue (in billions of dollars) derived from each of these 
goods is
W(t0)  4
S(t0)  7
O(t0)  10
and that S is growing at 8%, O is growing at 15%, while W is declining at 3%. At
what relative rate is total export revenue growing at this time?
Solution
Let R  W  S  O. At time t  t0, we know that
R(t0)  W(t0)  S(t0)  O(t0)  4  7  10  21
The percentage growth rates can be expressed as
so that
W(t0)  0.03W(t0)
S(t0)  0.08S(t0)
O(t0)  0.15O(t0)
Thus, at t  t0, the relative rate of growth of R is

That is, at time t  t0, the total revenue obtained from the three exported goods is

Applications; Exponential Models
Earlier in this chapter we saw how continuous compounding and radioactive decay can
be modeled using exponential functions. ln this section, we introduce several additional
exponential models from a variety of areas such as business and economics, biology,
psychology, demography, and sociology. We begin with two examples illustrating the
particular issues that arise when sketching exponential and logarithmic graphs.
As when graphing polynomials or rational functions, the key to graphing a function
f(x) involving ex or lnx is to use the derivative f (x) to ﬁnd intervals of increase and
decrease and then use the second derivative f (x) to determine concavity.
EXAMPLE 4.4.1
Sketch the graph of f(x)  x2  8 ln x.
Solution
The function f(x) is deﬁned only for x  0. Its derivative is
and f (x)  0 if and only if 2x2  8 or x  2 (since x  0). Testing the sign of f (x)
for 0  x  2 and for x  2, you obtain the intervals of increase and decrease shown
in the ﬁgure.
Notice that the arrow pattern indicates there is a relative minimum at x  2, and since
f(2)  22  8 ln 2  1.5, the minimum point is (2, 1.5).
The second derivative
satisﬁes f (x)  0 for all x  0, so the graph of f(x) is always concave up and there
are no inﬂection points.
Checking for asymptotes, you ﬁnd
and
so the y axis (x  0) is a vertical asymptote, but there is no horizontal asymptote. The
x intercepts are found by using your calculator to solve the equation

To summarize, the graph falls (down from the vertical asymptote) to the minimum
at (2, 1.5), after which it rises indeﬁnitely, while maintaining a concave up shape.
It passes through the x intercept (1.2, 0) on the way down and through (2.9, 0) as it
rises. The graph is shown in Figure 4.9.
EXAMPLE 4.4.2
Determine where the function
is increasing and decreasing, and where its graph is concave up and concave down.
Find the relative extrema and inﬂection points and draw the graph.
Solution
The ﬁrst derivative is
Since 
is always positive, f (x) is zero if and only if x  0. Since
, the only critical point is (0, 0.4). By the product rule, the
second derivative is
which is zero if x  1. Since
and
the potential inﬂection points are (1, 0.24) and (1, 0.24).
Plot the critical points and then check the signs of the ﬁrst and second deriva-
tives on each of the intervals deﬁned by the x coordinates of these points:
The arrow pattern indicates there is a relative maximum at (0, 0.4), and since the con-
cavity changes at x  1 (from up to down) and at x  1 (from down to up), both
(1, 0.24) and (1, 0.24) are inﬂection points.
Complete the graph, as shown in Figure 4.10, by connecting the key points with
a curve of appropriate shape on each interval. Notice that the graph has no x intercepts

IQ scores, measurements on large populations of living organisms, the velocity
of a molecule in a gas, and numerous other important phenomena.

Suppose you own an asset whose value increases with time. The longer you hold the
asset, the more it will be worth, but there may come a time when you could do bet-
ter by selling the asset and reinvesting the proceeds. Economists determine the opti-
mal time for selling by maximizing the present value of the asset in relation to the
prevailing rate of interest, compounded continuously. The application of this criterion
is illustrated in Example 4.4.3.
EXAMPLE 4.4.3
Suppose you own a parcel of land whose market price t years from now will be
V(t)  20,000
dollars. If the prevailing interest rate remains constant at 7% com-
pounded continuously, when will the present value of the market price of the land
be greatest?
Solution
In t years, the market price of the land will be V(t)  20,000
. The present value
of this price is
P(t)  V(t)e0.07t  20,000
e0.07t  20,000
The goal is to maximize P(t) for t  0. The derivative of P is

Thus, P(t) is undeﬁned when t  0 and P(t)  0 when
or
Since P(t) is positive if 0  t  51.02 and negative if t  51.02, it follows
that the graph of P is increasing for 0  t  51.02 and decreasing for t  51.02,
as shown in Figure 4.11. Thus, the present value is maximized in approximately
51 years.
NOTE
The optimization criterion used in Example 4.4.3 is not the only way
to determine the optimal holding time. For instance, you may decide to sell the
asset when the percentage rate of growth of the asset’s value just equals the pre-
vailing rate of interest (7% in the example). Which criterion seems more rea-
sonable to you? Actually, it does not matter, for the two criteria yield exactly the
same result! A proof of this equivalence is outlined in Exercise 58.
■
A quantity Q(t) is said to experience exponential growth if 
for k  0
and exponential decay if 
. Many important quantities in business and
economics, and the physical, social, and biological sciences can be modeled in terms
of exponential growth and decay. The future value of a continuously compounded
investment grows exponentially, as does population in the absence of restrictions. We
discussed the decay of radioactive substances in Section 4.2. Other examples of expo-
nential decay include present value of a continuously compounded investment, sales
of certain commodities once advertising is discontinued, and the concentration of drug
in a patient’s bloodstream.

Typical exponential growth and decay graphs are shown in Figure 4.12. It is cus-
tomary to display such graphs only for t  0. Note that the graph of Q(t)  Q0ekt
“begins” at Q0 on the vertical axis since
Q(0)  Q0ek(0)  Q0

Note also that the graph of Q(t)  Q0ekt rises sharply since
which means that Q(t) always increases at a rate proportional to its current value, so
the larger the value of Q, the larger the slope. The graph of 
also begins
at Q0, but falls sharply, approaching the t axis asymptotically. Here is an example of
a business model involving exponential decay.
EXAMPLE 4.4.4
A marketing manager determines that sales of a certain commodity will decline expo-
nentially once the advertising campaign for the commodity is terminated. It is found
that 21,000 units are being sold at the time of termination and 5 weeks later the sales
level is 19,000 units.
a. Find S0 and k so that S(t)  S0ekt gives the sales level t weeks after termination
of advertising. What sales should be expeced 8 weeks after the advertising ends?
b. At what rate are sales changing t weeks after termination of the campaign? What
is the percentage rate of change?
Solution
For simplicity, express sales S in terms of thousands of units.
a. We know that S  21 when t  0 and S  19 when t  5. Substituting t  0
into the formula S(t)  S0ekt, we get
S(0)  21  S0ek(0)  S0(1)  S0
so S0  21 and S(t)  21ekt for all t. Substituting S  19 and t  5, we ﬁnd
that 19  21ek(5) or
Taking the natural logarithm on each side of this equation, we ﬁnd that
Thus, for all t  0, we have
S(t)  21e0.02t
For t  8,
S(8)  21e0.02(8)  17.9
so the model predicts sales of about 17,900 units 8 weeks after the advertising
campaign ends.

b. The rate of change of sales is given by the derivative
S(t)  21[e0.02t (0.02)]  0.02(21)e0.02t
and the percentage rate of change PR is
That is, sales are declining at the rate of 2% per week.
Notice that the percentage rate of change obtained in Example 4.4.4b is the same
as k, expressed as the percentage. This is no accident, since for any function of the
form Q(t)  Q0ert, the percentage rate of change is
For instance, an investment in an account that earns interest at an annual rate of
5% compounded continuously has a future value B  Pe0.05t. Thus, the percentage
rate of change of the future value is 100(0.05)  5%. which is exactly what we
would expect.
The graph of a function of the form Q(t)  B  Aekt, where A, B, and k are posi-
tive constants, is sometimes called a learning curve. The name arose when psychol-
ogists discovered that for t  0, functions of this form often realistically model the
relationship between the efﬁciency with which an individual performs a task and the
amount of training time or experience the “learner” has had.
To sketch the graph of Q(t)  B  Aekt for t  0, note that
Q(t)  Aekt(k)  Akekt
and
Q(t)  Akekt(k)  Ak 2ekt
Since A and k are positive, it follows that Q(t)  0 and Q(t)  0 for all t, so the
graph of Q(t) is always rising and is always concave down. Furthermore, the vertical
(Q axis) intercept is Q(0)  B  A, and Q  B is a horizontal asymptote since
A graph with these features is sketched in Figure 4.13. The behavior of the learn-
ing curve as 
reﬂects the fact that “in the long run,” an individual approaches
his or her learning “capacity,” and additional training time will result in only mar-
ginal improvement in performance efﬁciency.

Solution
a. The number of letters a new employee can sort per hour is

b. After 6 months, the average clerk can sort
Q(6)  700  400e0.5(6)  700  400e3  680

c. As t increases without bound, Q(t) approaches 700. Hence, the average clerk will
ultimately be able to sort approximately 700 letters per hour. The graph of the
function Q(t) is sketched in Figure 4.14.
The graph of a function of the form 
, where A, B, and k are positive
constants, is called a logistic curve. A typical logistic curve is shown in Figure 4.15.
Notice that it rises steeply like an exponential curve at ﬁrst, and then turns over and
ﬂattens out, approaching a horizontal asymptote in much the same way as a learn-
ing curve. The asymptotic line represents a “saturation level” for the quantity rep-
resented by the logistic curve and is called the carrying capacity of the quantity.
For instance, in population models, the carrying capacity represents the maximum
number of individuals the environment can support, while in a logistic model for
the spread of an epidemic, the carrying capacity is the total number of individuals
susceptible to the disease, say, those who are unvaccinated or, at worst, the entire
community.
To sketch the graph of Q(t) 
for t  0, note that

As shown in this diagram, there is an inﬂection point at 
since the concavity
changes there (from up to down).
The vertical intercept of the logistic curve is
Since Q(t) is deﬁned for all t  0, the logistic curve has no vertical asymptotes, but
y  B is a horizontal asymptote since
To summarize, as shown in Figure 4.15, the logistic curve begins at
rises sharply (concave up) until it reaches the inﬂection point at 
and then ﬂattens out as it continues to rise (concave down) toward the hor-
izontal asymptote y  B. Thus, B is the carrying capacity of the quantity Q(t) repre-
sented by the logistic curve, and the inﬂection point at 
can be interpreted as 
a point of diminishing growth.
Logistic curves often provide accurate models of population growth when envi-
ronmental factors such as restricted living space, inadequate food supply, or urban
pollution impose an upper bound on the possible size of the population. Logistic
curves are also often used to describe the dissemination of privileged information or
rumors in a community, where the restriction is the number of individuals suscepti-
ble to receiving such information. Here is an example in which a logistic curve is
used to describe the spread of an infectious disease.
EXAMPLE 4.4.6

inﬂuenza, approximately 
thousand people had caught the disease.

b. The rate of infection begins to decline at the inﬂection point on the graph of Q(t).
By comparing the given formula with the logistic formula 
you ﬁnd that B  20, A  19, and Bk  1.2. Thus, the inﬂection point occurs when
so the epidemic begins to fade about 2.5 weeks after it starts.

An organism such as Paciﬁc salmon or bamboo that breeds only once during its life-
time is said to be semelparous. Biologists measure the per capita rate of reproduction
of such an organism by the function*
where p(x) is the likelihood of an individual organism surviving to age x and f(x) is
the number of female births to an individual reproducing at age x. The larger the value
of R(x), the more offspring will be produced. Hence, the age at which R(x) is maxi-
mized is regarded as the optimal age for reproduction.
EXAMPLE 4.4.7

SPREAD OF DISEASE
In the Think About It
essay at the end of Chapter 3, we examined
several models associated with the AIDS
epidemic. Using a data analysis program, we
obtain the function
C(t)  456  1,234te0.137t
as a model for the number of cases of AIDS
reported t years after the base year of 1990.
a. According to this model, in what year will the

68. RULE OF 70
Investors are often interested in 
knowing how long it takes for a particular
investment to double. A simple means for making
this determination is the “rule of 70,” which says:
The doubling time of an investment with an
annual interest rate r (expressed as a decimal) 
compounded continuously is given by 
.
a. For interest rate r, use the formula B  Pert to
ﬁnd the doubling time for r  4, 6, 9, 10, and
12. In each case, compare the value with the
value obtained from the rule of 70.

in part (a) and write a paragraph on which rule
you would prefer to use.

measured in micrograms per milliliter of blood.
Blood samples are taken periodically, and it is
determined that the maximum concentration of
drug occurs 2 hours after it is administered and is
10 micrograms per milliliter.
a. Use this information to determine A and k.
b. A new dose will be administered when the con-
centration falls to 1 microgram per milliliter.
When does this occur?
76. CHEMICAL REACTION RATE
The effect of
temperature on the reaction rate of a chemical
reaction is given by the Arrhenius equation
where k is the rate constant, T (in kelvin) is the
temperature, and R is the gas constant. The
k  AeE0/RT
quantities A and E0 are ﬁxed once the reaction is
speciﬁed. Let k1 and k2 be the reaction rate
constants associated with temperatures T1 and T2.
Find an expression for ln
in terms of E0, R, 
T1, and T2.

POPULATION GROWTH
According to a logis-
tic model based on the assumption that the earth can
support no more than 40 billion people, the world’s
population (in billions) t years after 1960 is 
given by a function of the form 
where C and k are positive constants. Find the func-
tion of this form that is consistent with the fact that
the world’s population was approximately 3 billion in
1960 and 4 billion in 1975. What does your model
predict for the population in the year 2000? Check
the accuracy of the model by consulting an almanac.
78. THE SPREAD OF AN EPIDEMIC
Public
health records indicate that t weeks after the
outbreak of a certain form of inﬂuenza,
approximately
thousand people had caught the disease. At what
rate was the disease spreading at the end of the
second week? At what time is the disease
spreading most rapidly?
79. ACIDITY (pH) OF A SOLUTION
The acidity
of a solution is measured by its pH value, which
is deﬁned by pH  log10 [H3O], where [H3O]
is the hydronium ion concentration (moles/liter) 
of the solution. On average, milk has a pH value
that is three times the pH value of a lime, which
in turn has half the pH value of an orange. If the
average pH of an orange is 3.2, what is the
average hydronium ion concentration of a lime?
80. CARBON DATING
A Cro-Magnon cave
painting at Lascaux, France, is approximately
15,000 years old. Approximately what ratio of 14C
to 12C would you expect to ﬁnd in a fossil found
in the same cave as the painting?
81. MORTALITY RATES
It is sometimes useful for
actuaries to be able to project mortality rates
within a given population. A formula sometimes
used for computing the mortality rate D(t) for
women in the age group 25–29 is

82. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
The gross
domestic product (GDP) of a certain country was
100 billion dollars in 1990 and 165 billion dollars
in 2000. Assuming that the GDP is growing
exponentially, what will it be in the year 2010?
83. ARCHAEOLOGY
“Lucy,” the famous prehuman
whose skeleton was discovered in Africa, has been
found to be approximately 3.8 million years old.
a. Approximately what percentage of original 14C
would you expect to ﬁnd if you tried to apply car-
bon dating to Lucy? Why would this be a prob-
lem if you were actually trying to “date” Lucy?
b. In practice, carbon dating works well only for
relatively “recent” samples—those that are no
more than approximately 50,000 years old. For
older samples, such as Lucy, variations on
carbon dating have been developed, such as
potassium-argon and rubidium-strontium dating.
Read an article on alternative dating methods
and write a paragraph on how they are used.*
84. RADIOLOGY
The radioactive isotope 
gallium-67 (67Ga), used in the diagnosis of
malignant tumors, has a half-life of 46.5 hours. If
we start with 100 milligrams of the isotope, how
many milligrams will be left after 24 hours? When
will there be only 25 milligrams left? Answer
these questions by ﬁrst using a graphing utility to
graph an appropriate exponential function and then
using the TRACE and ZOOM features.

When A  10 and B  0.1, this maximum remains at x  10 (ﬁgure on the right). In
this case, the y coordinate of the maximum increases by the A factor. In general, it 
can be shown that the x value of the maximal point is just . The A factor does not 
change the location of the x value of the maximum, but it does affect the y value as
a multiplier. To conﬁrm this analytically, set the derivative of y  AxeBx equal to
zero and solve for the location of the maximal point.
Following Example 4.4.2, store f(x) into Y1 and f (x) into Y2 (but deselected), and

x intercepts of f (x) are located at x  1 and x  1. Since the second derivative
f (x) represents the concavity function of f(x), we know that at these values f(x)
changes concavity. At the inﬂection point (1, 0.242), f(x) changes concavity from

FORENSIC ACCOUNTING: BENFORD’S LAW
You might guess that the ﬁrst digit of each number in a collection of numbers has an
equal chance of  being any of the digits 1 through 9, but it was discovered in 1938
by physicist Frank Benford that the chance that the digit is a 1 is more than 30%!
Naturally occurring numbers exhibit a curious pattern in the proportions of the ﬁrst
digit: smaller digits such as 1, 2, and 3 occur much more often than larger digits, as
seen in the following table:

Benford distribution
Naturally occurring, in the case, means that the numbers arise without explicit
bound and describe similar quantities, such as the populations of cities or the amounts
paid out on checks. This pattern also holds for exponentially growing numbers and
some types of randomly sampled (but not randomly generated) numbers, and for this
reason it is a powerful tool for determining if these types of data are genuine. The
distribution of digits generally conforms closely to the following rule: the proportion
of numbers such that the ﬁrst digit is n is given by
This rule, known as Benford’s law, is used to detect fraud in accounting and is
one of several techniques in a ﬁeld called forensic accounting. Often people who write
fraudulent checks, such as an embezzler at a corporation try to make the ﬁrst digits
(or even all the digits) occur equally often so as to appear to be random. Benford’s
law predicts that the ﬁrst digits of such a set of accounting data should not be evenly
proportioned, but rather show a higher occurrence of smaller digits. If an employee
is writing a large number of checks or committing many monetary transfers to a sus-
picious target, the check values can be analyzed to see if they follow Benford’s law,
indicating possible fraud if they do not.

This technique can be applied to various types of accounting data (such as for

gross domestic products of many countries. Benford’s law is also used by the Inter-
nal Revenue Sevice to detect fraud and has been applied to locate errors in data entry
and analysis.
Questions
1.
Verify that the formula given for the proportions of digits,
produces the values in the given table. Use calculus to show that the proportion
is a decreasing function of n.
2. The proportions of ﬁrst digits depend on the base of the number system used.
Computers generally use number systems that are powers of 2. Benford’s law
for base b is
where n ranges from 1 to b. Compute a table like the one given for base b  10
for the bases 4 and 8. Using these computed tables and the given table, do the
proportions seem to be evening out or becoming more uneven as the size of the
base increases?.
Use calculus to justify your assertion by viewing P(n) as a function of b,
for particular values of n. For instance, for n  1:
Use this new function to determine if the proportion of numbers with leading
digit 1 are increasing or decreasing as the size of base b increases. What hap-

Compute the proportions corresponding to each of the ﬁrst digits. Do you think
that fraud may be present? (In actual investigations, statistical tests are used to
determine if the deviation is statistically signiﬁcant.)
4. Select a collection of numbers arbitrarily from a newspaper or magazine and
record the ﬁrst digit (the ﬁrst nonzero digit if it is a decimal less than 1). Do the
numbers appear to follow Benford’s law?

SECTION 5.1
Antidifferentiation: The Indeﬁnite Integral
How can a known rate of inﬂation be used to determine future prices? What is the
velocity of an object moving along a straight line with known acceleration? How can
knowing the rate at which a population is changing be used to predict future popula-
tion levels? In all these situations, the derivative (rate of change) of a quantity is
known and the quantity itself is required. Here is the terminology we will use in con-
nection with obtaining a function from its derivative.
NOTE
Sometimes we write the equation 
F(x)  f(x)
as
■
Later in this section, you will learn techniques you can use to ﬁnd antideriva-
tives. Once you have found what you believe to be an antiderivative of a function,
you can always check your answer by differentiating. You should get the original func-
tion back. Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 5.1.1
Verify that F(x) 
x3  5x  2 is an antiderivative of f(x)  x2  5.

F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x) if and only if F(x)  f(x). Differentiate F and you
will ﬁnd that 
 x2  5  f(x)

A function has more than one antiderivative. For example, one antiderivative of the
function f(x)  3x2 is F(x)  x3, since

A function F(x) is said to be an antiderivative of f(x) if

antidifferentiation or indeﬁnite integration.

In general, if F is one antiderivative of f, then so is any function of the form
G(x)  F(x)  C, for constant C since
G(x)  [F(x)  C]
 F(x)  C
 F(x)  0
 f(x)
Conversely, it can be shown that if F and G are both antiderivatives of f, then 
G(x)  F(x)  C, for some constant C (Exercise 64). To summarize:
There is a simple geometric interpretation for the fundamental property of anti-
derivatives. If F and G are both antiderivatives of f, then
G(x)  F(x)  f(x)
This means that the slope F(x) of the tangent line to y  F(x) at the point (x, F(x))
is the same as the slope G(x) of the tangent line to y  G(x) at (x, G(x)). Since the
slopes are equal, it follows that the tangent lines at (x, F(x)) and (x, G(x)) are paral-
lel, as shown in Figure 5.1a. Since this is true for all x, the entire curve y  G(x)
must be parallel to the curve y  F(x), so that
y  G(x)  F(x)  C
In general, the collection of graphs of all antiderivatives of a given function f is a
family of parallel curves that are vertical translations of one another. This is illus-
trated in Figure 5.1b for the family of antiderivatives of f(x)  3x2.
Fundamental Property of Antiderivatives

If F(x) is an antideriva-
tive of the continuous function f(x), then any other antiderivative of f(x) has the
form G(x)  F(x)  C for some constant C.

CHAPTER 5
Integration

You have just seen that if F(x) is one antiderivative of the continuous function f(x),
then all such antiderivatives may be characterized by F(x)  C for constant C. The
family of all antiderivatives of f(x) is written
and is called the indeﬁnite integral of f(x). The integral is “indeﬁnite” because it
involves a constant C that can take on any value. In Section 5.3, we introduce a
deﬁnite integral that has a speciﬁc numerical value and is used to represent a vari-
ety of quantities, such as area, average value, present value of an income ﬂow, and
cardiac output, to name a few. The connection between deﬁnite and indeﬁnite inte-
grals is made in Section 5.3 through a result so important that it is referred to as the
fundamental theorem of calculus.
In the context of the indeﬁnite integral f(x) dx  F(x)  C, the integral symbol
is , the function f(x) is called the integrand, C is the constant of integration, and
dx is a differential that speciﬁes x as the variable of integration. These features are
displayed in this diagram for the indeﬁnite integral of f(x)  3x2:
integrand
constant of integration
integral symbol
variable of integration
For any differentiable function F, we have
since by deﬁnition, F(x) is an antiderivative of F(x). Equivalently,
This property of indeﬁnite integrals is especially useful in applied problems where a
rate of change F(x) is given and we wish to ﬁnd F(x). Several such problems are
examined later in this section, in Examples 5.1.4 through 5.1.8.
It is useful to remember that if you have performed an indeﬁnite integration
calculation that leads you to believe that f(x) dx  G(x)  C, then you can check
your calculation by differentiating G(x):
If G(x)  f(x), then the integration f(x) dx  G(x)  C is correct, but if
G(x) is anything other than f(x), you’ve made a mistake.
This relationship between differentiation and antidifferentiation enables us to estab-
lish these integration rules by “reversing” analogous differentiation rules.

A differential equation is an equation that involves differentials or derivatives. Such
equations are of great importance in modeling and occur in a variety of applications.
An initial value problem is a problem that involves solving a differential equation
subject to a speciﬁed initial condition. For instance, in Example 5.1.4, we were
required to ﬁnd y  f(x) so that
subject to the condition y  6 when x  2
We solved this initial value problem by ﬁnding the antiderivative
and then using the initial condition to evaluate C. The same approach is used in
Examples 5.1.5 through 5.1.8 to solve a selection of applied initial value problems
from business, economics, biology, and physics. Similar initial value problems appear
in examples and exercises throughout this chapter.
EXAMPLE 5.1.5
A manufacturer has found that marginal cost is 3q2  60q  400 dollars per unit when
q units have been produced. The total cost of producing the ﬁrst 2 units is $900. What
is the total cost of producing the ﬁrst 5 units?
Solution
Recall that the marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost function C(q). Thus,
and so C(q) must be the antiderivative
for some constant K. (The letter K was used for the constant to avoid confusion with
the cost function C.)
The value of K is determined by the fact that C(2)  900. In particular,

The population P(t) of a bacterial colony t hours after observation begins is found to
be changing at the rate
If the population was 200,000 bacteria when observations began, what will the
population be 12 hours later?
Solution
The population P(t) is found by antidifferentiating 
as follows:
 2,000 e0.1t  5,000 e0.03t  C
Since the population is 200,000 when t  0, we have

so C  203,000 and

EXAMPLE 5.1.7
A retailer receives a shipment of 10,000 kilograms of rice that will be used up over
a 5-month period at the constant rate of 2,000 kilograms per month. If storage costs
are 1 cent per kilogram per month, how much will the retailer pay in storage costs
over the next 5 months?
Solution
Let S(t) denote the total storage cost (in dollars) over t months. Since the rice is used
up at a constant rate of 2,000 kilograms per month, the number of kilograms of rice
in storage after t months is 10,000  2,000t. Therefore, since storage costs are 1 cent
per kilogram per month, the rate of change of the storage cost with respect to time is

Recall from Section 2.2 that if an object moving along a straight line is at the posi-
tion s(t) at time t, then its velocity is given by v 
and its acceleration by a 
Turning things around, if the acceleration of the object is given, then its velocity and
position can be found by integration. Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 5.1.8
A car is traveling along a straight, level road at 45 miles per hour (66 feet per second)
when the driver is forced to apply the brakes to avoid an accident. If the brakes sup-
ply a constant deceleration of 22 ft/sec2 (feet per second, per second), how far does
the car travel before coming to a complete stop?
Solution
Let s(t) denote the distance traveled by the car in t seconds after the brakes are applied.
Since the car decelerates at 22 ft/sec2, it follows that a(t)  22; that is,
Integrating, you ﬁnd that the velocity at time t is given by
To evaluate C1, note that v  66 when t  0 so that

It takes him 00.7 seconds to react to the crisis. Then
he hits the brakes, and the car decelerates at the
constant rate of 28 ft/sec2 (28 feet per second, per

SECTION 5.2
Integration by Substitution
The majority of functions that occur in practical situations can be differentiated by
applying rules and formulas such as those you learned in Chapter 2. Integration, how-
ever, is at least as much an art as a science, and many integrals that appear decep-
tively simple may actually require a special technique or clever insight.
For example, we easily ﬁnd that
by applying the power rule, but suppose we wish to compute
We could proceed by expanding the integrand (3x  5)7 and then integrating term by
term, but the algebra involved in this approach is daunting. Instead, we make the
change of variable
u  3x  5
so that
du  3 dx
or
dx 
du
Then, by substituting these quantities into the given integral, we get
We can check this computation by differentiating using the chain rule (Section 2.4):
which veriﬁes that 
(3x  5)8 is indeed an antiderivative of (3x  5)7.
The change of variable procedure we have just demonstrated is called integration
by substitution, and it amounts to reversing the chain rule for differentiation. To see
why, consider an integral that can be written as
Suppose G is an antiderivative of g, so that G  g. Then, according to the chain rule

Just-In-Time REVIEW
Recall that the differential of
y  f(x) is dy  f(x) dx.

Therefore, by integrating both sides of this equation with respect to x, we ﬁnd that
 G(u(x))  C
In other words, once we have an antiderivative for g(u), we also have one for f(x).
A useful device for remembering the substitution procedure is to think of 
u  u(x) as a change of variable whose differential du  u(x) dx can be manipulated
algebraically. Then
substitute du for u(x) dx
where G is an antiderivative of g
substitute u(x) for u
Here is a step-by-step procedure for integrating by substitution.

Using Substitution to Integrate 
f(x) dx
Step 1. Choose a substitution u  u(x) that “simpliﬁes” the integrand f(x).
Step 2. Express the entire integral in terms of u and du  u(x) dx. This means
that all terms involving x and dx must be transformed to terms involv-
ing u and du.
Step 3. When step 2 is complete, the given integral should have the form
If possible, evaluate this transformed integral by ﬁnding an
antiderivative G(u) for g(u).
Step 4. Replace u by u(x) in G(u) to obtain an antiderivative G(u(x)) for f(x),
so that
 f(x) dx  G(u(x))  C
 f(x) dx g(u) du

An old saying goes, “The ﬁrst step in making rabbit stew is to catch a rabbit.”
Likewise, the ﬁrst step in integrating by substitution is to ﬁnd a suitable change of
variable u  u(x) that simpliﬁes the integrand of the given integral f(x) dx without
adding undesired complexity when dx is replaced by du  u(x) dx. Here are a few
guidelines for choosing u(x):
since G  G

1. If possible, try to choose u so that u(x) is part of the integrand f(x).
2. Consider choosing u as the part of the integrand that makes f(x) difﬁcult to inte-
grate directly, such as the quantity inside a radical, the denominator of a fraction,
or the exponent of an exponential function.
3. Don’t “oversubstitute.” For instance, in our introductory example (3x  5)7 dx,
a common mistake is to use u  (3x  5)7. This certainly simpliﬁes the integrand,
but then du  7(3x  5)6(3) dx, and you are left with a transformed integral that
is more complicated than the original.
4. Persevere. If you try a substitution that does not result in a transformed integral
you can evaluate, try a different substitution.
Examples 5.2.1 through 5.2.6 illustrate how substitutions are chosen and used in var-
ious kinds of integrals.

Sometimes an integral “looks” like it should be evaluated using a substitution but

You can certainly handle this integral using the substitution

since e2e5x  e5x2
In Example 5.2.7, we used algebra to put the integrand into a form where sub-
stitution was not necessary. In Examples 5.2.8 and 5.2.9, we use algebra as a ﬁrst

We can integrate x  2 directly using the power rule. For the term

Now, if you substitute u  ex  1 with du  ex dx into the given integral, you get
substitute ex  1 for u
The method of substitution does not always succeed. In Example 5.2.10, we consider
an integral very similar to the one in Example 5.2.3 but just enough different so no
substitution will work.
EXAMPLE 5.2.10
Evaluate 
Solution
The natural substitution is u  x4  2, as in Example 5.2.3. As before, you ﬁnd 
du  4x3 dx, so x3 dx 
du, but this integrand involves x4, not x3. The “extra” factor
of x satisﬁes 
, so when the substitution is made, you have
which is hardly an improvement on the original integral! Try a few other possible
substitutions (say, u  x2 or u  x3) to convince yourself that nothing works.

SECTION 5.3
The Deﬁnite Integral and the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Suppose a real estate agent wants to evaluate an unimproved parcel of land that is
100 feet wide and is bounded by streets on three sides and by a stream on the fourth
side. The agent determines that if a coordinate system is set up as shown in Figure 5.2,
the stream can be described by the curve y  x3  1, where x and y are measured in
hundreds of feet. If the area of the parcel is A square feet and the agent estimates its
land is worth $12 per square foot, then the total value of the parcel is 12A dollars. If
the parcel were rectangular in shape or triangular or even trapezoidal, its area A could
be found by substituting into a well-known formula, but the upper boundary of the
parcel is curved, so how can the agent ﬁnd the area and hence the total value of
the parcel?
Our goal in this section is to show how area under a curve, such as the area A
in our real estate example, can be expressed as a limit of a sum of terms called a
deﬁnite integral. We will then introduce a result called the fundamental theorem of
calculus that allows us to compute deﬁnite integrals and thus ﬁnd area and other quan-
tities by using the indeﬁnite integration (antidifferentiation) methods of Sections 5.1
and 5.2. In Example 5.3.3, we will illustrate this procedure by expressing the area A
in our real estate example as a deﬁnite integral and evaluating it using the funda-
mental theorem of calculus.

FIGURE 5.2
Determining land value by ﬁnding the area under a curve.
Consider the area of the region under the curve y  f(x) over an interval a  x  b,
where f(x)  0 and f is continuous, as illustrated in Figure 5.3. To ﬁnd this area, we
will follow a useful general policy:
When faced with something you don’t know how to handle, try to relate it
to something you do know how to handle.
In this particular case, we may not know the area under the given curve, but we do
know how to ﬁnd the area of a rectangle. Thus, we proceed by subdividing the region
into a number of rectangular regions and then approximate the area A under the curve
y  f(x) by adding the areas of the approximating rectangles.
To be more speciﬁc, begin the approximation by dividing the interval a  x  b
into n equal subintervals, each of length 
and let xj denote the left
endpoint of the jth subinterval, for j  1, 2, . . . , n. Then draw n rectangles such that
the jth rectangle has the jth subinterval as its base and f(xj) as its height. The approx-
imation scheme is illustrated in Figure 5.4.

which approximates the total area A under the curve.
FIGURE 5.5
The approximation improves as the number of subintervals increases.
As the number of subintervals n increases, the approximating sum Sn gets closer
and closer to what we intuitively think of as the area under the curve, as illustrated
in Figure 5.5. Therefore, it is reasonable to deﬁne the actual area A under the curve
as the limit of the sums. To summarize:

Area Under a Curve
■
Let f(x) be continuous and satisfy f(x)  0 on the
interval a  x  b. Then the region under the curve y  f(x) over the interval 
a  x  b has area
where xj is the left endpoint of the jth subinterval if the interval a  x  b is divided
into n equal parts, each of length 
.

NOTE
At this point, you may ask, “Why use the left endpoint of the subintervals
rather than, say, the right endpoint or even the midpoint?” The answer is that there
is no reason we can’t use those other points to compute the height of our approxi-
mating rectangles. In fact, the interval a  x  b can be subdivided arbitrarily and
arbitrary points chosen in each subinterval, and the result will still be the same. How-
ever, proving this equivalence is difﬁcult, well beyond the scope of this text.
■
Here is an example in which area is computed as the limit of a sum and then
checked using a geometric formula.
EXAMPLE 5.3.1
Let R be the region under the graph of f(x)  2x  1 over the interval 1  x  3, as
shown in Figure 5.6a. Compute the area of R as the limit of a sum.

Solution
The region R is shown in Figure 5.6 with six approximating rectangles, each of width
. The left endpoints in the partition of 1  x  3 are x1  1, 
x2  
, and similarly, 
. The corre-
sponding values of f(x)  2x  1 are given in the following table:

Thus, the area A of the region R is approximated by the sum
FIGURE 5.6
Approximating the area under a line with rectangles.
If you continue to subdivide the region R using more and more rectangles, the cor-
responding approximating sums Sn approach the actual area A of the region. The sum
we have already computed for n  6 is listed in the following table, along with those
for n  10, 20, 50, 100, and 500. (If you have access to a computer or a programmable
calculator, see if you can write a program for generating any such sum for given n.)

Such a trapezoid has area

Area is just one of many quantities that can be expressed as the limit of a sum. To
handle all such cases, including those for which f(x)  0 is not required and left
endpoints are not used, we require the terminology and notation introduced in the
following deﬁnition.

Surprisingly, the fact that f(x) is continuous on a  x  b turns out to be enough

The symbol 
used for the deﬁnite integral is essentially the same as the
symbol 
for the indeﬁnite integral, even though the deﬁnite integral is a spe-
ciﬁc number while the indeﬁnite integral is a family of functions, the antiderivatives
of f. You will soon see that these two apparently very different concepts are intimately
related. Here is a compact form for the deﬁnition of area using the integral notation.

SECTION 5.3
THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL AND THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS
405
Rules 4 and 5 are really special cases of the deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral. The
ﬁrst three rules can be proved by using the fundamental theorem of calculus along with
an analogous rule for indeﬁnite integrals. For instance, to verify the constant multiple
rule, suppose F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x). Then, according to the constant multiple
rule for indeﬁnite integrals, kF(x) is an antiderivative of kf(x) and the fundamental the-
orem of calculus tells us that
You are asked to verify the sum rule using similar reasoning in Exercise 70.
In the case where f(x)  0 on the interval a  x  b, the subdivision rule is
a geometric reflection of the fact that the area under the curve y  f(x) over the
interval a  x  b is the sum of the areas under y  f(x) over the subintervals
a  x  c and c  x  b, as illustrated in Figure 5.7. However, it is important to
remember that the subdivision rule is true even if f(x) does not satisfy f(x)  0
on a  x  b.

Solving this equation for the required integral 
f(x) dx and substituting the given
information, we obtain
When using a substitution u  g(x) to evaluate a deﬁnite integral 
you can
proceed in either of these two ways:
1. Use the substitution to ﬁnd an antiderivative F(x) for f(x) and then evaluate the
deﬁnite integral using the fundamental theorem of calculus.
2. Use the substitution to express the integrand and dx in terms of u and du and
to replace the original limits of integration, a and b, with transformed limits 
c  g(a) and d  g(b). The original integral can then be evaluated by applying the
fundamental theorem of calculus to the transformed deﬁnite integral.
These procedures are illustrated in Examples 5.3.7 and 5.3.8.

Solution
The integrand is a product in which one factor 8x is a constant multiple of the deriv-
ative of an expression x2  1 that appears in the other factor. This suggests that you
let u  x2  1. Then du  2x dx, and so
The limits of integration, 0 and 1, refer to the variable x and not to u. You can, there-
fore, proceed in one of two ways. Either you can rewrite the antiderivative in terms
of x, or you can ﬁnd the values of u that correspond to x  0 and x  1.

level of production is raised from 6 units to 10 units?
Solution
Let C(q) denote the total cost of producing q units. Then the marginal cost is the

Thus, the mass of the protein has a net decrease of 4 g over the ﬁrst 2 hours.
We close this section with a justiﬁcation of the fundamental theorem of calculus for
the case where f(x)  0. In this case, the deﬁnite integral 
represents the
area under the curve y  f(x) over the interval [a, b]. For ﬁxed x between a and b,
let A(x) denote the area under y  f(x) over the interval [a, x]. Then the difference
quotient of A(x) is
and the expression A(x  h)  A(x) in the numerator is just the area under the curve
y  f(x) between x and x  h. If h is small, this area is approximately the same as
the area of the rectangle with height f(x) and width h as indicated in Figure 5.8.

A(x)  F(x)  C
for some constant C and all x in the interval a  x  b. Since A(x) represents the area

SECTION 5.4
Applying Deﬁnite Integration: Area Between
Curves and Average Value
We have seen that area can be expressed as a special kind of limit of a sum called a
deﬁnite integral and then computed by applying the fundamental theorem of calcu-
lus. This procedure, called deﬁnite integration, was introduced through area because
area is easy to visualize, but there are many applications other than area in which the
integration process plays an important role.
In this section, we extend the ideas introduced in Section 5.3 to ﬁnd the area
between two curves and the average value of a function. As part of our study of area
between curves, we will examine an important socioeconomic device called a Lorentz
curve, which is used to measure relative wealth within a society.
Intuitively, deﬁnite integration can be thought of as a process that “accumulates” an
inﬁnite number of small pieces of a quantity to obtain the total quantity. Here is a
step-by-step description of how to use this process in applications.

A Procedure for Using Deﬁnite Integration in Applications
To use deﬁnite integration to “accumulate” a quantity Q over an interval a  x  b,
proceed as follows:
Step 1.
Divide the interval a  x  b into n equal subintervals, each of length
Choose a number xj from the jth subinterval, for 
j  1, 2, . . . , n.
Step 2. Approximate small parts of the quantity Q by products of the 
form f(xj)x, where f(x) is an appropriate function that is continuous
on a  x  b.
Step 3. Add the individual approximating products to estimate the total quan-
tity Q by the Riemann sum
[ f(x1)  f(x2)      f(xn)]x
Step 4. Make the approximation in step 3 exact by taking the limit of the Rie-
mann sum as 
to express Q as a deﬁnite integral; that is,
Then use the fundamental theorem of calculus to compute 
and
thus to obtain the required quantity Q.

Given the function of f(x) 

approximate the value of the integral 
f(x) dx by
completing these steps:
a. Find the numbers x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 that sub-
divide the interval 0  x  2 into four equal
subintervals. Use these numbers to form four

rectangles that approximate the area under the
curve y  f(x) over 0  x  2.
b. Estimate the value of the given integral by com-
puting the sum of the areas of the four approxi-
mating rectangles in part (a).
c.
Repeat steps (a) and (b) with eight subintervals
instead of four.

NOTATION:
We can use summation notation to represent the Riemann sums
that occur when quantities are modeled using deﬁnite integration. Speciﬁcally, to
describe the sum
a1  a2      an
it sufﬁces to specify the general term aj in the sum and to indicate that n terms
of this form are to be added, starting with the term where j  1 and ending with
j  n. For this purpose, it is customary to use the uppercase Greek letter sigma () 
and to write the sum as 
that is,
In particular, the Riemann sum
[ f(x1)  f(x2)      f(xn)] x
can be written in the compact form
Thus, the limit statement
used to deﬁne the deﬁnite integral can be expressed as
■
In certain practical applications, you may ﬁnd it useful to represent a quantity of inter-
est in terms of area between two curves. First, suppose that f and g are continuous,
nonnegative [that is, f(x)  0 and g(x)  0], and satisfy f(x)  g(x) on the interval

Just-In-Time REVIEW
The summation notation is
reviewed in Appendix A4
including examples. Note that
there is nothing special about
using “j” for the index in the
notation. The most commonly
used indices are i, j, and k.

Then, to ﬁnd the area of the region R between the curves y  f(x) and y  g(x)
over the interval a  x  b, we simply subtract the area under the lower curve y  g(x)
(Figure 5.9c) from the area under the upper curve y  f(x) (Figure 5.9b), so that
Area of R  [area under y  f(x)]  [area under y  g(x)]
This formula still applies whenever f(x)  g(x) on the interval a  x  b, even
when the curves y  f(x) and y  g(x) are not always both above the x axis. We will
show that this is true by using the procedure for applying deﬁnite integration described
on page 414.
Step 1. Subdivide the interval a  x  b into n equal subintervals, each of width 
For j  1, 2, . . . , n, let xj be the left endpoint of the jth subinterval.
Step 2. Construct approximating rectangles of width x and height f(xj)  g(xj).
This is possible since f(x)  g(x) on a  x  b, which guarantees that the height
is nonnegative; that is f(xj)  g(xj)  0. For j  1, 2, . . . ,n, the area 
[ f(xj)  g(xj)]x of the jth rectangle you have just constructed is approximately
the same as the area between the two curves over the jth subinterval, as shown in
Figure 5.10a.

The area between curves can sometimes be used as a way of measuring the amount
of a quantity that has been accumulated during a particular procedure. For instance,
suppose that t years from now, two investment plans will be generating proﬁt P1(t)
and P2(t), respectively, and that their respective rates of proﬁtability, P1(t) and P2(t),
are expected to satisfy P2(t)  P1(t) for the next N years; that is, over the time inter-
val 0  t  N. Then E(t)  P2(t)  P1(t) represents the excess proﬁt of plan 2 over
plan 1 at time t, and the net excess proﬁt NE  E(N)  E(0) over the time interval

Area also plays an important role in the study of Lorentz curves, a device used by
both economists and sociologists to measure the percentage of a society’s wealth that
is possessed by a given percentage of its people. To be more speciﬁc, the Lorentz
curve for a particular society’s economy is the graph of the function L(x), which
denotes the fraction of total annual national income earned by the lowest-paid 100x%
of the wage-earners in the society, for 0  x  1. For instance, if the lowest-paid 30%
of all wage-earners receive 23% of the society’s total income, then L(0.3)  0.23.
Note that L(x) is an increasing function on the interval 0  x  1 and has these
properties:
1. 0  L(x)  1
because L(x) is a percentage
2. L(0)  0
because no wages are earned when no wage-earners are employed
3. L(1)  1
because 100% of wages are earned by 100% of the wage-earners
4. L(x)  x
because the lowest-paid 100x% of wage-earners cannot receive
more than 100x% of total income

The Gini index always lies between 0 and 1. An index of 0 corresponds to total
equity in the distribution of income, while an index of 1 corresponds to total inequity
(all income belongs to 0% of the population). The smaller the index, the more equitable
the distribution of income, and the larger the index, the more the wealth is concentrated
in only a few hands. Example 5.4.4 illustrates how Lorentz curves and the Gini index
can be used to compare the relative equity of income distribution for two professions.
EXAMPLE 5.4.4

income for dentists and contractors in a certain state are given by the functions

The line y  x represents the ideal case corresponding to complete equality in the
distribution of income (wage-earners with the lowest 100x% of income receive 100x%
of the society’s wealth). The closer a particular Lorentz curve is to this line, the more
equitable the distribution of wealth in the corresponding society. We represent the total
deviation of the actual distribution of wealth in the society from complete equality by
the area of the region R1 between the Lorentz curve y  L(x) and the line y  x. The
ratio of this area to the area of the region R2 under the complete equality line y  x
over 0  x  1 is used as a measure of the inequality in the distribution of wealth in
the society. This ratio, called the Gini index, denoted GI (also called the index of
income inequality), may be computed by the formula
(see Figure 5.15b). To summarize:

Since the Gini index for dentists is smaller, it follows that in this state, the incomes
of dentists are more evenly distributed than those of contractors.
Using the Gini index, we can see how the distribution of income in the United
States compares to that in other countries. Table 5.1 lists the Gini index for selected
industrial and developing nations. Note that with an index of 0.46, the distribution of
income in the United States is about the same as that of Thailand, is less equitable
than the United Kingdom, Germany, or Denmark, but much more equitable than Brazil
or Panama. (Is there anything you know about the socio-political nature of these coun-
tries that would explain the difference in income equity?)

As a second illustration of how deﬁnite integration can be used in applications, we will
compute the average value of a function, which is of interest in a variety of situations.
First, let us take a moment to clarify our thinking about what we mean by “average
value.” A teacher who wants to compute the average score on an examination simply
adds all the individual scores and then divides by the number of students taking the
exam, but how should one go about ﬁnding, say, the average pollution level in a city
during the daytime hours? The difﬁculty is that since time is continuous, there are “too
many” pollution levels to add up in the usual way, so how should we proceed?
Consider the general case in which we wish to ﬁnd the average value of the func-
tion f(x) over an interval a  x  b on which f is continuous. We begin by subdividing 
the interval a  x  b into n equal parts, each of length

taken from the jth subinterval for j  1, 2, . . . , n, then the average of the corre-
sponding functional values f(x1), f(x2), . . . , f(xn) is
since 
which we recognize as a Riemann sum.
If we reﬁne the partition of the interval a  x  b by taking more and more
subdivision points, then Vn becomes more and more like what we may intuitively
think of as the average value V of f(x) over the entire interval a  x  b. Thus, it is
reasonable to deﬁne the average value V as the limit of the Riemann sum Vn as
that is, as the deﬁnite integral

EXAMPLE 5.4.6
A researcher models the temperature T (in °C) during the time period from 6 A.M. to

where t is the number of hours after 6 A.M.

5 P.M.?
b. At what time (or times) during the workday is the temperature in the city the
same as the average temperature found in part (a)?
Solution
a. Since 8 A.M. and 5 P.M. are, respectively, t  2 and t  11 hours after 6 A.M., we
want to compute the average of the temperature T(t) for 2  t  11, which is

Since t  0.39 is outside the time interval

The average value of a function has several useful interpretations. First, note that if
f(x) is continuous on the interval 
and F(x) is any antiderivative of f(x) over
the same interval, then the average value V of f(x) over the interval satisﬁes
fundamental theorem of calculus
We recognize this difference quotient as the average rate of change of F(x) over

Rate Interpretation of Average Value
■
The average value of a func-
tion f(x) over an interval a  x  b where f(x) is continuous is the same as the
average rate of change of any antiderivative F(x) of f(x) over the same interval.
For instance, since the total cost C(x) of producing x units of a commodity is an
antiderivative of marginal cost C(x), it follows that the average rate of change of
cost over a range of production a  x  b equals the average value of the marginal
cost over the same range.
The average value of a function f(x) on an interval a  x  b where f(x)  0 can
also be interpreted geometrically by rewriting the integral formula for average value

in the form
In the case where f(x)  0 on the interval a  x  b, the integral on the right can be
interpreted as the area under the curve y  f(x) over a  x  b, and the product on
the left as the area of a rectangle of height V and width b  a equal to the length of
the interval. In other words:

Geometric Interpretation of Average Value

The average value V
of f(x) over an interval a  x  b where f(x) is continuous and satisﬁes f(x)  0

Normally,

a surge in its metabolic rate, which then gradually
returns to the basal level.

Additional Applications to Business and Economics
In this section, we examine several important applications of deﬁnite integration to
business and economics, such as future and present value of an income ﬂow, con-
sumers’ willingness to spend, and consumers’ and producers’ surplus. We begin by
showing how integration can be used to measure the value of an asset.
Suppose that t years after being put into use, a machine has generated total revenue
R(t) and that the total cost of operating and servicing the machine up to this time is
C(t). Then the total proﬁt generated by the machine up to time t is P(t)  R(t)  C(t).
Proﬁt declines when costs accumulate at a higher rate than revenue; that is, when
C(t)  R(t). Thus, a manager may consider disposing of the machine at the time T
when C(T)  R(T), and for this reason, the time period 0  t  T is called the
useful life of the machine. The net proﬁt over the useful life of the machine provides
the manager with a measure of its value.
EXAMPLE 5.5.1
Suppose that when it is t years old, a particular industrial machine is generating
revenue at the rate R(t)  5,000  20t2 dollars per year and that operating and

servicing costs related to the machine are accumulating at the rate C(t)  2,000  10t2
dollars per year.
a. What is the useful life of this machine?
b. Compute the net proﬁt generated by the machine over its period of useful life.
Solution
a. To ﬁnd the machine’s useful life T, solve

Thus, the machine has a useful life of T  10 years.
b. Since proﬁt P(t) is given by P(t)  R(t)  C(t), we have P(t)  R(t)  C(t),
and the net proﬁt generated by the machine over its useful life 0  t  10 is
The rate of revenue and rate of cost curves are sketched in Figure 5.17. The net earn-
ings of the machine over its useful life are represented by the area of the (shaded)

Refer to Example 5.5.1.

In our next application, we consider a stream of income transferred continuously into
an account in which it earns interest over a speciﬁed time period (the term). Then
the future value of the income stream is the total amount (money transferred into
the account plus interest) that is accumulated in this way during the speciﬁed term.
The calculation of the amount of an income stream is illustrated in Example 5.5.2.
The strategy is to approximate the continuous income stream by a sequence of dis-
crete deposits called an annuity. The amount of the approximating annuity is a cer-
tain sum whose limit (a deﬁnite integral) is the future value of the income stream.
EXAMPLE 5.5.2
Money is transferred continuously into an account at the constant rate of $1,200 per
year. The account earns interest at the annual rate of 8% compounded continuously.
How much will be in the account at the end of 2 years?
Solution
Recall from Section 4.1 that P dollars invested at 8% compounded continuously will
be worth Pe0.08t dollars t years later.
To approximate the future value of the income stream, divide the 2-year time
interval 0  t  2 into n equal subintervals of length t years and let tj denote the
beginning of the jth subinterval. Then, during the jth subinterval (of length t years),
Money deposited  (dollars per year)(number of years)  1,200t
If all of this money were deposited at the beginning of the subinterval (at time tj), it
would remain in the account for 2  tj years and therefore would grow to
dollars. Thus,
Future value of money deposited
during jth subinterval
The situation is illustrated in Figure 5.18.
FIGURE 5.18
The (approximate) future value of the money deposited during the jth
subinterval.
The future value of the entire income stream is the sum of the future values of
the money deposited during each of the n subintervals. Hence,

(Note that this is only an approximation because it is based on the assumption that
all 1,200 tn dollars are deposited at time tj rather than continuously throughout the
jth subinterval.)
As n increases without bound, the length of each subinterval approaches zero
and the approximation approaches the true future value of the income stream.
Hence,

gration formula for the future value of an income stream with rate of ﬂow given by

Jane is trying to decide between two investments. The ﬁrst costs $1,000 and is
expected to generate a continuous income stream at the rate of f1(t)  3,000e0.03t dol-
lars per year. The second investment costs $4,000 and is estimated to generate income
at the constant rate of f2(t)  4,000 dollars per year. If the prevailing annual interest
rate remains ﬁxed at 5% compounded continuously over the next 5 years, which
investment is better over this time period?
Solution
The net value of each investment over the 5-year time period is the present value 
of the investment less its initial cost. For each investment, we have r  0.05 and

generates net income of $13,695.94. The second investment is slightly better.
Recall that the consumer demand function p  D(q) gives the price p that must be
charged for each unit of the commodity if q units are to be sold (demanded). If A(q)
is the total amount that consumers are willing to pay for q units, then the demand
function can also be thought of as the rate of change of A(q) with respect to q; that
is, A(q)  D(q). lntegrating and assuming that A(0)  0 (consumers are willing to
pay nothing for 0 units), we ﬁnd that A(q0), the amount that consumers are willing
to pay for q0 units of the commodity, is given by
In this context, economists call A(q) the total willingness to spend and D(q)  A(q),
the marginal willingness to spend. ln geometric terms, the total willingness to spend
for q0 units is the area under the demand curve p  D(q) between q  0 and q  q0,
as shown in Figure 5.19.

a. Find the total amount of money consumers are willing to spend to get 3 units of

b. Sketch the demand curve and interpret the answer to part (a) as an area.
Solution
a. Since the demand function is D(q)  4(25  q2), is the total amount that con-
sumers are willing to spend to get 3 units of the commodity is given by the

b. The consumers’ demand curve is sketched in Figure 5.20. In geometric terms, the

FIGURE 5.20
Consumers’ willingness to spend for 3 units when demand is given by

surplus. That is,
To get a better feel for the concept of consumers’ surplus, consider a family that
is willing to spend up to $150 to own one television set but is willing to pay no more
than $75 for a second set, say, to settle conﬂicts over viewing preferences. Suppose
the market price for television sets turns out to be $100 per set. Then the family spends
2  $100  $200 for its two sets, rather than the $150  $75  $225 that it was
willing to pay. The perceived savings of $225  $200  $25 is the consumers’ sur-
plus of the family.
FIGURE 5.21
Geometric interpretation of consumers’ surplus.
Consumers’ surplus has a simple geometric interpretation, which is illustrated in Fig-
ure 5.21. The symbols p0 and q0 denote the market price and corresponding demand,
respectively. Figure 5.21a shows the region under the demand curve from q  0 to
q  q0. Its area, as we have seen, represents the total amount that consumers are will-
ing to spend to get q0 units of the commodity. The rectangle in Figure 5.21b has an area
of p0q0 and hence represents the actual consumer expenditure for q0 units at p0 dollars
per unit. The difference between these two areas (Figure 5.21c) represents the consumers’
surplus. That is, consumers’ surplus CS is the area of the region between the demand
curve p  D(q) and the horizontal line p  p0 and hence is equal to the deﬁnite integral

Producers’ surplus is the other side of the coin from consumers’ surplus. Recall
that the supply function p  S(q) gives the price per unit that producers are willing
to accept in order to supply q units to the marketplace. However, any producer who
is willing to accept less than p0  S(q0) dollars for q0 units gains from the fact that
the price is p0. Then producers’ surplus is the difference between what producers
would be willing to accept for supplying q0 units and the price they actually receive.
Reasoning as we did with consumers’ surplus, we obtain the following formula for
producers’ surplus.

SECTION 5.6
Additional Applications to the Life 
and Social Sciences
We have already seen how deﬁnite integration can be used to compute quantities of
interest in the social and life sciences, such as net change, average value, and the Gini
index of a Lorentz curve. In this section, we examine several additional such appli-
cations, including survival and renewal within a group, blood ﬂow through an artery,
and cardiac output. We shall also discuss how volume can be computed using inte-
gration and used for purposes such as measuring the size of a lake or a tumor.
In Example 5.6.1, a survival function gives the fraction of individuals in a group or
population that can be expected to remain in the group for any speciﬁed period of
time. A renewal function giving the rate at which new members arrive is also known,
Survival and Renewal

and the goal is to predict the size of the group at some future time. Problems of this
type arise in many ﬁelds, including sociology, ecology, demography, and even ﬁnance,
where the “population” is the number of dollars in an investment account and “sur-
vival and renewal” refer to features of an investment strategy.
EXAMPLE 5.6.1
A new county mental health clinic has just opened. Statistics from similar facilities
suggest that the fraction of patients who will still be receiving treatment at the clinic
t months after their initial visit is given by the function f(t)  et
20. The clinic ini-
tially accepts 300 people for treatment and plans to accept new patients at the con-
stant rate of 
patients per month. Approximately how many people will be
receiving treatment at the clinic 15 months from now?
Solution
Since f(15) is the fraction of patients whose treatment continues at least 15 months,
it follows that of the current 300 patients, only 300f(15) will still be receiving treat-
ment 15 months from now.
To approximate the number of new patients who will be receiving treatment 15
months from now, divide the 15-month time interval 0  t  15 into n equal subin-
tervals of length t months and let tj denote the beginning of the jth subinterval. Since
new patients are accepted at the rate of 10 per month, the number of new patients
accepted during the jth subinterval is 10t. Fifteen months from now, approximately
15  tj months will have elapsed since these 10t new patients had their initial visits,
and so approximately (10t)f(15  tj) of them will still be receiving treatment at that
time (Figure 5.23). It follows that the total number of new patients still receiving treat-
ment 15 months from now can be approximated by the sum
Adding this to the number of current patients who will still be receiving treatment in
15 months, you get
where P is the total number of all patients (current and new) who will be receiving
treatment 15 months from now.

As n increases without bound, the approximation improves and approaches the

Hence,
That is, 15 months from now, the clinic will be treating approximately 247 patients.
In Example 5.6.1, we considered a variable survival function f(t) and a constant
renewal rate function g(t). Essentially the same analysis applies when the renewal
function also varies with time. Here is the result. Note that for deﬁniteness, time is
given in years, but the same basic formula would also apply for other units of time,
for example, minutes, weeks, or months, as in Example 5.6.1.

Survival and Renewal
■
Suppose a population initially has P0 members
and that new members are added at the (renewal) rate of R(t) individuals per year.
Further suppose that the fraction of the population that remain for at least t years
after arriving is given by the (survival) function S(t). Then, at the end of a term
of T years, the population will be

In Example 5.6.1, each time period is 1 month, the initial “population” (member-
ship) is 
, the renewal rate is R  10, the survival function is f(t)  et/20,
and the term is T  15 months. Here is another example of survival/renewal from
biology. 
EXAMPLE 5.6.2
A mild toxin is introduced to a bacterial colony whose current population is 600,000.
Observations indicate that R(t)  200e0.01t bacteria per hour are born in the colony
at time t and that the fraction of the population that survives for t hours after birth is
S(t)  e0.015t. What is the population of the colony after 10 hours?
P0  300

Solution
Substituting P0  600,000, R(t)  200e0.01t, and S(t)  e0.015t into the formula for
survival and renewal, we ﬁnd that the population at the end of the term of T  10
hours is
Thus, the population of the colony declines from 600,000 to about 518,381 during
the ﬁrst 10 hours after the toxin is introduced.
Biologists have found that the speed of blood in an artery is a function of the dis-
tance of the blood from the artery’s central axis. According to Poiseuille’s law, the
speed (in centimeters per second) of blood that is r centimeters from the central axis
of the artery is S(r)  k(R2  r2), where R is the radius of the artery and k is a con-
stant. In Example 5.6.3, you will see how to use this information to compute the rate
at which blood ﬂows through the artery.
EXAMPLE 5.6.3
Find an expression for the rate (in cubic centimeters per second) at which blood ﬂows
through an artery of radius R if the speed of the blood r centimeters from the central
axis is S(r)  k(R2  r2), where k is a constant.
Solution
To approximate the volume of blood that ﬂows through a cross section of the artery
each second, divide the interval 0  r  R into n equal subintervals of width r cen-
timeters and let rj denote the beginning of the jth subinterval. These subintervals deter-
mine n concentric rings as illustrated in Figure 5.24.

If r is small, the area of the jth ring is approximately the area of a rectangle
whose length is the circumference of the (inner) boundary of the ring and whose width
is r. That is,
Area of jth ring  2rj r
If you multiply the area of the jth ring (square centimeters) by the speed (centimeters
per second) of the blood ﬂowing through this ring, you get the volume rate (cubic cen-
timeters per second) at which blood ﬂows through the jth ring. Since the speed of blood
ﬂowing through the jth ring is approximately S(rj) centimeters per second, it follows that
The volume rate of ﬂow of blood through the entire cross section is the sum of n
such terms, one for each of the n concentric rings. That is,
As n increases without bound, this approximation approaches the true value of
the rate of ﬂow. In other words,
Thus, the blood is ﬂowing at the rate of 
cubic centimeters per second.
In studying the cardiovascular system, physicians and medical researchers are often
interested in knowing the cardiac output of a person’s heart, which is the volume
of blood it pumps in unit time. Cardiac output is measured by a procedure called
the dye dilution method.* A known amount of dye is injected into a vein near the
heart. The dye then circulates with the blood through the right side of the heart, the

A monitoring probe is introduced into the aorta, and blood samples are taken at reg-
ular time intervals to measure the concentration of dye leaving the heart until all
the dye has passed the monitoring point. A typical concentration graph is shown in
Figure 5.25.

Suppose the amount of dye injected is D mg, and that C(t) (mg/L) is the con-
centration of dye at time t. Let T0 denote the total time required for all the dye to
pass the monitoring point, and divide the time interval 0  t  T0 into n equal

If R is the cardiac output (liters/min), 
then approximately Rt liters of blood ﬂow past the monitoring probe during the kth

of dye over all n subintervals, we obtain the sum
as an approximation for the total amount of dye, and by taking the limit as n →
we obtain the actual total amount of dye as a deﬁnite integral:

EXAMPLE 5.6.4
A physician injects 4 mg of dye into a vein near the heart of a patient, and a moni-
toring device records the concentration of dye in the blood at regular intervals over
a 23-second period. It is determined that the concentration at time t (0  t  23) is
closely approximated by the function
Based on this information, what is the patient’s cardiac output?
Solution
Integrating C(t) over the time interval 0  t  23, we ﬁnd that
Thus, the cardiac output is

The population density of an urban area is the number of people p(r) per square
mile that are located a distance r miles from the city center. We can determine the
total population P of the portion of the city that lies within R miles of the city cen-
ter by using integration.
Our approach to using population density to determine total population will be
similar to the approach used earlier in this section to determine the ﬂow of blood
through an artery. In particular, divide the interval 0  r  R into n subintervals, 
each of width Δr 

subinterval, for k  1, 2, . . . , n. These subintervals determine n concentric rings,

a. What population lives within a 5-mile radius of the city center?

per square mile. What is the total population within the city limits?
Solution

Using the substitution

In addition, the limits of integration are transformed as follows:
Therefore, we have 
So roughly 208,500 people live within a 5-mile radius of the city center.

In the next application, the deﬁnite integral is used to ﬁnd the volume of a solid of
revolution formed by revolving a region R in the xy plane about the x axis.
The technique is to express the volume of the solid as the limit of a sum of the
volumes of approximating disks. In particular, suppose that S is the solid formed by
rotating the region R under the curve y  f(x) between x  a and x  b about the
x axis, as shown in Figure 5.27a. Divide the interval a  x  b into n equal subin-
tervals of length Δx. Then approximate the region R by n rectangles and the solid S
by the corresponding n cylindrical disks formed by rotating these rectangles about the

An experiment is
conducted with two bacterial colonies, each of
which initially has a population of 100,000. In
the ﬁrst colony, a mild toxin is introduced that
restricts growth so that only 50 new individuals
are added per day and the fraction of individuals
that survive at least t days is given by 
f(t)  e0.011t. The growth of the second colony
is restricted indirectly, by limiting food supply
and space for expansion, and after t days, it is
found that this colony contains

A
pharmaceutical ﬁrm has been granted permission
by the FDA to test the effectiveness of a new drug
in combating a virus. The ﬁrm administers the
drug to a test group of uninfected but susceptible
individuals, and using statistical methods,
determines that t months after the test begins,
people in the group are becoming infected at the

In an
investigation by V. A. Tucker and K. Schmidt-
Koenig,* it was determined that the energy E
expended by a bird in ﬂight varies with the speed v
(km/hr) of the bird. For a particular kind of parakeet,
the energy expenditure changes at a rate given by
for v  0
where E is given in joules per gram mass per
kilometer. Observations indicate that the parakeet
tends to ﬂy at the speed vmin that minimizes E.
a. What is the most economical speed vmin?

JUST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES
IN PERCEPTION
Calculus can help us answer questions about human perception, including questions
relating to the number of different frequencies of sound or the number of different
hues of light people can distinguish (see the accompanying ﬁgure). Our present goal
is to show how integral calculus can be used to estimate the number of steps a per-
son can distinguish as the frequency of sound increases from the lowest audible fre-
quency of 15 hertz (Hz) to the highest audible frequency of 18,000 Hz. (Here hertz,
abbreviated Hz, equals cycles per second.)
A mathematical model* for human auditory perception uses the formula
y  0.767x0.439, where y Hz is the smallest change in frequency that is detectable at
frequency x Hz. Thus, at the low end of the range of human hearing, 15 Hz, the small-
est change of frequency a person can detect is y  0.767  150.439  2.5 Hz, while
at the upper end of human hearing, near 18,000 Hz, the least noticeable difference is
approximately y  0.767  18,0000.439  57 Hz. If the smallest noticeable change of
frequency were the same for all frequencies that people can hear, we could ﬁnd the
number of noticeable steps in human hearing by simply dividing the total frequency
range by the size of this smallest noticeable change. Unfortunately, we have just seen
that the smallest noticeable change of frequency increases as frequency increases, so
the simple approach will not work. However, we can estimate the number of distin-
guishable steps using integration.
Toward this end, let y  f(x) represent the just noticeable difference of frequency
people can distinguish at frequency x. Next, choose numbers x0, x1, . . . , xn beginning
at x0  15 Hz and working up through higher frequencies to xn  18,000 Hz in such
a way that for j  0, 2, . . . , n  1,

Here are some questions in which you are asked to apply these principles to issues
involving both auditory and visual perception.

The 88 keys of a piano range from 15 Hz to 4,186 Hz. If the number of keys

a piano have?
2. An 8-bit gray-scale monitor can display 256 shades of gray. Let x represent the

One model for gray-scale perception uses the formula y  Ax0.3, where A is a
positive constant and y is the smallest change detectable by the human eye at
gray-level x. Experiments show that the human eye is incapable of distinguish-
ing as many as 256 different shades of gray, so the number n of just noticeable
shading differences from x  0 to x  1 must be less than 256. Using the

Integration by Parts; Integral Tables
Integration by parts is a technique of integration based on the product rule for dif-
ferentiation. In particular, if u(x) and v(x) are both differentiable functions of x,
then
so that 
Integrating both sides of this equation with respect to x, we obtain
since u(x)v(x) is an antiderivative of 
[u(x)v(x)]. Moreover, we can write this inte-
gral formula in the more compact form
since
The equation 
u dv  uv  vdu is called the integration by parts formula.
The great value of this formula is that if we can ﬁnd functions u and v so that a given
integral 
f(x) dx can be expressed in the form 
f(x) dx  u dv, then we have
and the given integral is effectively exchanged for the integral 
vdu. If the integral
vdu is easier to compute than 
u dv, the exchange facilitates ﬁnding 
f(x)dx. Here
is an example.

Our strategy is to express 
x2 ln xdx as 
u dv by choosing u and v so that 
vdu is
easier to evaluate than 
u dv. This strategy suggests that we choose
u  ln x
and
dv  x2dx
since
is a simpler expression than ln x, while v can be obtained by the relatively easy
integration
(For simplicity, we leave the “ C” out of the calculation until the ﬁnal step.) Sub-

To ﬁnd an integral 
f(x) dx using the integration by parts formula:

Choosing a suitable u and dv for integration by parts requires insight and expe-
rience. For instance, in Example 6.1.1, things would not have gone so smoothly if we
had chosen u  x2 and dv  ln xdx. Certainly du  2xdx is simpler than u  x2, but
what is v  ln x dx? In fact, ﬁnding this integral is just as hard as ﬁnding the 
original integral 
x2 ln xdx (see Example 6.1.4). Examples 6.1.2, 6.1.3, and 6.1.4
illustrate several ways of choosing u and dv in integrals that can be handled using
integration by parts.
EXAMPLE 6.1.2

Solution
Although both factors x and e2x are easy to integrate, only x becomes simpler when

NOTE
Some integrals can be evaluated by either substitution or integration by
parts. For instance, the integral in Example 6.1.3 can be found by substituting as
follows:
Let u  x  5. Then du  dx and x  u  5, and
This form of the integral is not the same as that found in Example 6.1.3. To show
that the two forms are equivalent, note that the antiderivative in Example 6.1.3
can be expressed as
which is the form of the antiderivative obtained by substitution. This example
shows that it is quite possible for you to do everything right and still not get the
answer given at the back of the book.

The integration by parts formula can be applied to deﬁnite integrals by noting that

EXAMPLE 6.1.4
Find the area of the region bounded by the curve y  ln x, the x axis, and the lines
x  1 and x  e.
Solution
The region is shown in Figure 6.1. Since ln x  0 for 1  x  e, the area is given by
the deﬁnite integral
To evaluate this integral using integration by parts, think of ln xdx as (lnx)(1 dx) and use
u  ln x
dv  1 dx
Thus, the required area is
As another illustration of the role played by integration by parts in applications,
we use it in Example 6.1.5 to compute the future value of a continuous income stream
(see Section 5.5).
EXAMPLE 6.1.5
Joyce is considering a 5-year investment, and estimates that t years from now it will
be generating a continuous income stream of 3,000  50t dollars per year. If the pre-
vailing annual interest rate remains ﬁxed at 4% compounded continuously during the
entire 5-year term, what should the investment be worth in 5 years?
Solution
We measure the “worth” of Joyce’s investment by the future value of the income ﬂow
over the 5-year term. Recall (from Section 5.5) that an income stream deposited
continuously at the rate f(t) into an account that earns interest at an annual rate r
compounded continuously for a term of T years has future value FV given by the
integral

Thus, in 5 years, Joyce’s investment will be worth roughly $17,274.

Most integrals you will encounter in the social, managerial, and life sciences can be
evaluated using the basic formulas given in Section 5.1 along with substitution and
integration by parts. However, occasionally you may encounter an integral that can-
not be handled by these methods. Some integrals such as 
cannot be evaluated
by any method, but others can be found by using a table of integrals.
Table 6.1, a short table of integrals,* is listed on pages 484 and 485. Note that
the table is divided into sections such as “integrals involving 
,” and that
formulas are given in terms of constants denoted a, b, and n. The use of this table is
demonstrated in Examples 6.1.7 through 6.1.11.

Introduction to Differential Equations
In Section 1.4, we introduced mathematical modeling as a dynamic process involv-
ing three stages:
1. A real-world problem is given a mathematical formulation, called a mathemati-
cal model. This often involves making simplifying assumptions about the prob-
lem to make it more accessible.
2. The mathematical model is analyzed or solved by using tools from areas such as
algebra, calculus, or statistics, among others, or by numerical methods involving
graphing calculators or computers.
3. The solution of the mathematical model is interpreted in terms of the original
real-world problem. This often leads to adjustments in the assumptions of the
model.
The process may then be repeated, each time with a more reﬁned model, until a sat-
isfactory understanding of the real-world problem is attained.
We have used calculus to analyze mathematical models throughout this text, and
many of these models have involved rates of change. Sometimes the mathematical
formulation of a problem involves an equation in which a quantity and the rate of
change of that quantity are related by an equation. Since rates of change are expressed

in terms of derivatives or differentials, such an equation is appropriately called a
differential equation. For example,
are all differential equations. Differential equations are among the most useful tools for
modeling continuous phenomena. Population dynamics, chemical kinetics, spread of dis-
ease, dynamic economic behavior, ecology, and the transmission of information are a
few of the many areas in the managerial, physical, and social and life sciences that can
be studied using differential equations. In this section, we introduce techniques for solv-
ing basic differential equations and examine a few practical applications.
The simplest type of differential equation has the form
in which the derivative of the quantity y is given explicitly as a function of the inde-
pendent variable x. Such an equation can be solved by simply ﬁnding the indeﬁnite inte-
gral of g(x). A complete characterization of all possible solutions of the equation is called
a general solution. A differential equation coupled with a side condition is referred to
as an initial value problem, and a solution that satisﬁes both the differential equation
and the side condition is called a particular solution of the initial value problem. In
Examples 6.2.1 through 6.2.3, we illustrate this terminology and demonstrate how dif-
ferential equations can be used to build mathematical models.
EXAMPLE 6.2.1
Find the general solution of the differential equation
and the particular solution that satisﬁes y  2 when x  1.

This is the general solution since all solutions can be expressed in this form. For the
particular solution, substitute x  1 and y  2 into the general solution:

EXAMPLE 6.2.2
The resale value of a certain industrial machine decreases over a 10-year period
at a rate that depends on the age of the machine. When the machine is x years
old, the rate at which its value is changing is 220(x  10) dollars per year.
Express the value of the machine as a function of its age and initial value. If the
machine was originally worth $12,000, how much will it be worth when it is
10 years old?
Solution
Let V(x) denote the value of the machine when it is x years old. The derivative 
is equal to the rate 220(x  10) at which the value of the machine is changing. Hence,
to model this problem, we can use the differential equation
To ﬁnd V, solve this differential equation by integration:
Notice that C is equal to V(0), the initial value of the machine. A more descrip-
tive symbol for this constant is V0. Using this notation, you can write the general
solution as
V(x)  110x2  2,200x  V0
If V0  12,000, the corresponding particular solution is
V(x)  110x2  2,200x  12,000
Thus, when the machine is x  10 years old, its value is
V(10)  110(10)2  2,200(10)  12,000  $1,000

EXAMPLE 6.2.3
An oil well that has just been opened is expected to yield 300 barrels of crude oil per
month and, at that rate, is expected to run dry in 3 years. It is estimated that t months
from now, the price of crude oil will be 
dollars per barrel. If the
oil is sold as soon as it is extracted from the ground, what is the total revenue gen-
erated by the well during its operation?
Solution
Let R(t) be the revenue generated during the ﬁrst t months after the well is opened, so
that R(0)  0. To construct the relevant differential equation, use the rate relationship
We can model this problem using the differential equation
and it follows that
Integrating, we ﬁnd that the general solution of this differential equation is
Since R(0)  0, we ﬁnd that
R(0)  0  8,400(0)  60(0)3/2  C
so C  0, and the appropriate particular solution is

taining the independent variable appear on one side of the equation and all the terms
containing the dependent variable appear on the other. Differential equations with this
special property are said to be separable and can be solved by the following proce-
dure involving two integrations.

Separating the variables in the given differential equation and integrating, we get
so the general solution is
Since x  2 when t  1, we have
so that
In particular, when t  3, we have
Solving this equation for x, we get
which means that the object is at x  0.56 when t  3.

models, we showed that a function of the form Q(t)  Q0ekt changes at a rate
proportional to its current size at time t; namely, Q(t)  kQ(t). Example 6.2.6 shows
that the converse of this result is also true.

In Chapter 4, we referred to the graphs of functions of the form Q(t)  B  Aekt
as learning curves because functions of this form often describe the relationship
between the efficiency with which an individual performs a given task and the
amount of training or experience the “learner” has had. In general, any quantity
that grows at a rate proportional to the difference between its size and a ﬁxed upper
limit is represented by a function of this form. Here is an example involving such a
learning model.
EXAMPLE 6.2.7
The rate at which people hear about a new increase in postal rates is proportional to
the number of people in the country who have not yet heard about it. Express the
number of people who have heard already about the increase as a function of time.
Solution
Let Q(t) denote the number of people who have already heard about the rate increase
at time t and let B be the total population of the country. Then
and
Because the rate at which people hear about the increase is proportional to the num-
ber of people who have not yet heard about the increase, it follows that
where k is the constant of proportionality. Notice that the constant k must be positive

Denoting the constant eC by A and using functional notation, you can conclude that
Q(t)  B  Aekt
which is precisely the general equation of a learning curve. For reference, the graph
of Q is sketched in Figure 6.3.
Recall from Chapter 3 that the relative rate of growth of a quantity Q(t) is given by 
the ratio 
In exponential growth and decay, where Q(t)  kQ(t), the relative
rate of growth is constant; namely,
A population with no restrictions on environment or resources can often be modeled
as having exponential growth. However, when such restrictions exist, it is reasonable
to assume there is a largest population B supportable by the environment (called the
carrying capacity) and that at any time t, the relative rate of population growth is
proportional to the potential population B  Q(t); that is,
where k is a positive constant. This rate relationship leads to the differential equation
This is called the logistic equation, and the corresponding model of restricted popu-
lation growth is known as the logistic model.
The logistic differential equation is separable, but before solving it analytically,
let us see what we can deduce using qualitative methods. First, note that the logistic 
equation can be written as 
, where the population rate R(Q)  kQ(B  Q) 
is a quadratic function in Q. Since k 
 0, the graph of R(Q) is a downward opening
parabola (Figure 6.4), and since R(0)  R(B)  0, the graph intersects the Q axis 
at 0 and at B. The high point (vertex) of the graph is where Q 

If the initial population Q(0) is 0, then Q(t)  0 for all t

initial population is Q(0)  B, then the population stays at the level of the carrying
capacity for all t

rium solutions of the logistic equation, are shown in Figure 6.5a.

If the initial population Q(0) satisﬁes 0  Q(0)  B, then
R(Q)  kQ(B  Q) 
 0
since k, Q, and B  Q are all positive. Since the rate of growth is positive, the pop-
ulation Q(t) itself is increasing. As Q(t) approaches B, the population growth rate 
approaches 0, which suggests that the graph of the population function Q(t) “ﬂattens
out,” approaching the carrying capacity B asymptotically. If the initial population sat-
isﬁes Q(0) 
 B, we have
R(Q)  kQ(B  Q)  0
since k and Q are positive and B  Q is negative. In this case, the population Q(t)
decreases from its initial value, once again approaching the carrying capacity B
asymptotically. Some nonconstant solutions of the logistic equation are shown in
Figure 6.5b.
In addition to its role in modeling restricted population growth, the logistic equa-
tion can also be used to describe economic behavior as well as interactions within a
social group, such as the spread of rumors (see Exercise 44). In Example 6.2.8, we
use a logistic model to describe the spread of an epidemic.
EXAMPLE 6.2.8
The rate at which an epidemic spreads through a community is jointly proportional
to the number of residents who have been infected and the number of susceptible res-
idents who have not. Express the number of residents who have been infected as a
function of time.
dQ
dt

Solution
Let Q(t) denote the number of susceptible residents who have been infected by time t,
and let B denote the total number of susceptible residents. Then
and
“Jointly proportional” means “proportional to the product,” so the differential equa-
tion that describes the spread of the epidemic is
where k 
 0 is the constant of proportionality. (Do you see why k must be positive?)
This is a separable differential equation whose solution is

Use the statistical modeling
feature of your graphing
calculator to ﬁt a logistic curve
to the data and determine the
projected level of susceptible
residents that will ultimately be
infected, based on the logistic
model.

Finally, setting 
, we see that Q has the logistic form
The graph of Q(t), the number of infected residents, is shown in Figure 6.6. Note
that this graph has the characteristic “S shape” of a logistic curve with carrying capac-
ity B. At the beginning of the epidemic, only 
residents are infected.
The number of infected residents increases rapidly at ﬁrst and is spreading most rap-
idly at the inﬂection point on the graph. It is not difﬁcult to show that this occurs
when half the susceptible population is infected (see Exercise 67). The infection rate
then begins to decrease as the total number of infected residents asymptotically
approaches the level B where all susceptible residents would be infected.

An important application of separable differential equations is to model situations in
which a quantity is “diluted.” Such models can be used in a variety of situations in
areas such as ﬁnance, ecology, medicine, and chemistry. We illustrate the general dilu-
tion modeling procedure in a public health example.
EXAMPLE 6.2.9
The residents of a certain community have voted to discontinue the ﬂuoridation of
their water supply. The local reservoir currently holds 200 million gallons of
ﬂuoridated water that contains 1,600 pounds of ﬂuoride. The ﬂuoridated water is
ﬂowing out of the reservoir at the rate of 4 million gallons per day and is being
replaced at the same rate by unﬂuoridated water. At all times, the remaining ﬂuoride
is evenly distributed in the reservoir. Express the amount of ﬂuoride in the reservoir
as a function of time.
Solution
Let Q(t) be the amount of ﬂuoride (in pounds) in the reservoir t days after the ﬂuor-
idation ends. Begin with the rate relationship

The net rate of change of the ﬂuoride with respect to time is 
, and since the 
ﬂuoridation has been terminated, the rate of ﬂuoride ﬂowing in is 0. Since the vol-
ume of ﬂuoridated water in the reservoir stays ﬁxed at 200 million gallons and the
ﬂuoride is always evenly distributed in the reservoir, the concentration of ﬂuoride in
the reservoir at time t is given by the ratio
Therefore, since 4 million gallons of ﬂuoridated water are being removed each day,
the daily outﬂow rate of ﬂuoride is given by the product
The ﬂow rate relationships are summarized in this diagram:
Since the rate of change of the amount of ﬂuoride in the reservoir equals the
inﬂow rate minus the outﬂow rate, it follows that

Let S(p) denote the number of units of a particular commodity supplied to the mar-
ket at a price of p dollars per unit, and let D(p) denote the corresponding number of
units demanded by the market at the same price. In static circumstances, market
equilibrium occurs at the price where demand equals supply (recall the discussion in
Section 1.4). However, certain economic models consider a more dynamic kind of
economy in which price, supply, and demand are assumed to vary with time. One of
these, the Evans price adjustment model,* assumes that the rate of change of price
with respect to time t is proportional to the shortage D  S, so that
where k is a positive constant. Here is an example involving this model.
EXAMPLE 6.2.10
Suppose the price p(t) of a particular commodity varies in such a way that its rate of
change with respect to time is proportional to the shortage D  S, where D(p) and
S(p) are the linear demand and supply functions D  8  2p and S  2  p.
a. If the price is $5 when t  0 and $3 when t  2, ﬁnd p(t).

SECTION 6.3
Improper Integrals; Continuous Probability
The deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral 
, given in Section 5.3, requires the
interval of integration a  x  b to be bounded, but in certain applications, it is use-
ful to consider integrals over unbounded intervals such as x  a. We will deﬁne such
improper integrals in this section and examine a few properties and applications.
Then we will show how integration, including improper integration, can be used to
compute probability.
We denote the improper integral of f(x) over the unbounded interval x  a by
If f(x)  0 for x  a, this integral can be interpreted as the area of the
region under the curve y  f(x) to the right of x  a, as shown in Figure 6.9a.
Although this region has inﬁnite extent, its area may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite, depending
on how quickly f(x) approaches zero as x increases indeﬁnitely.

NOTE
You have just seen that the improper integral 
converges
(Example 6.3.1) while 
diverges (Example 6.3.2). In geometric terms,
this says that the area under the curve y 
to the right of x  1 is ﬁnite, while
the corresponding area under the curve y 
to the right of x  1 is inﬁnite. The
difference is due to the fact that as x increases without bound, 
approaches zero
more quickly than does . These observations are demonstrated in Figure 6.10.

Next, we examine two applications of the improper integral that generalize applica-
tions developed in Chapter 5. In each, the strategy is to express a quantity as a def-
inite integral with a variable upper limit of integration that is then allowed to increase
without bound. As you read through these applications, you may ﬁnd it helpful to
refer back to the analogous examples in Chapter 5.
In Example 5.5.3 of Section 5.5, we showed how the present value of an investment
that generates income continuously over a ﬁnite time period can be computed by a
deﬁnite integral. If the generation of income continues in perpetuity, then an improper
integral is required for computing its present value, as illustrated in Example 6.3.4.
EXAMPLE 6.3.4
A donor wishes to endow a scholarship at a local college with a gift that provides a
continuous income stream at the rate of 25,000  1,200t dollars per year in perpetu-
ity. Assuming the prevailing annual interest rate stays ﬁxed at 5% compounded con-
tinuously, what donation is required to ﬁnance the endowment?
Solution
The donor’s gift should equal the present value of the income stream in perpetuity.
Recall from Section 5.5 that an income stream f(t) deposited continuously for a term
of T years into an account that earns interest at an annual rate r compounded contin-
uously has a present value given by the integral

In Example 5.6.1 of Section 5.6, we examined a survival and renewal problem over
a term of ﬁnite length in which renewal occurred at a constant rate. In Example 6.3.5,
we consider the more general situation in which survival and renewal both vary with
time and the survival/renewal process occurs in perpetuity.

ning of the jth subinterval (Figure 6.11). Then,

That is, in the long run, the accumulation of radioactive waste from the plant will

Improper integrals also appear in the study of probability and statistics, which play
an important role in certain areas of the social, managerial, and life sciences. We close
this section with a brief introduction to this application.
For example, the life span of a lightbulb selected at random from a manufac-
turer’s stock is a quantity that cannot be predicted with certainty. The process of
selecting a bulb is called a random experiment, and the life span X of the bulb is a
continuous random variable. Other examples of continuous random variables
include the time a randomly selected motorist spends waiting at a trafﬁc light, the
weight of a randomly selected person, or the time it takes a randomly selected per-
son to learn a particular task.
The probability of an event that can result from a random experiment is a num-
ber between 0 and 1 that speciﬁes the likelihood of the event. For instance, in our
lightbulb example, one possible event is that a bulb selected randomly from the man-
ufacturer’s stock has a life span between 20 and 35 hours. If X is the random vari-
able denoting the life span of a randomly selected bulb, then this event can be described
by the inequality 20  X  35 and its probability denoted by P(20  X  35). Sim-
ilarly, the probability that the bulb will burn for at least 50 hours is denoted by
P(X  50) or P(50  X 
).
A probability density function for a continuous random variable X is a func-
tion f with the property that f(x)  0 for all real x and that the area under the graph
of f from x  a to x  b gives the probability P(a  X  b). The graph of a possible
probability density function for the life span of a lightbulb is sketched in Figure 6.12.
Its shape reﬂects the fact that most bulbs burn out relatively quickly. For example,
the probability that a bulb will fail within the ﬁrst 40 hours is represented by the area
under the curve between x  0 and x  40. This is much greater than the area under
the curve between x  80 and x  120, which represents the probability that the bulb
will fail between its 80th and 120th hours of use.
FIGURE 6.12

The values of a and b in this formula need not be ﬁnite, and if either is inﬁnite,
the corresponding probability is given by an improper integral. For example, the prob-
ability that X  a is
The second condition in the deﬁnition of a probability density function follows
from the fact that the event   X   is certain to occur. This condition can
also be expressed as
where the improper integral on the left is deﬁned as
and converges if and only if both limits exist.
How to determine the appropriate probability density function for a particu-
lar random variable is a central problem in probability theory that is beyond the
scope of this book. We restrict our attention to examining two examples illus-
trating particular probability density functions that prove useful in a variety of
applications.
A uniform probability density function (Figure 6.13) is constant over a bounded
interval A  x  B and zero outside that interval. A random variable that has a uni-
form density function is said to be uniformly distributed. Roughly speaking, for a
uniformly distributed random variable, all values in some bounded interval are
“equally likely.” More precisely, a continuous random variable is uniformly distrib-
uted if the probability that its value will be in a particular subinterval of the bounded
interval is equal to the probability that it will be in any other subinterval that has the
same length. An example of a uniformly distributed random variable is the waiting
time of a motorist at a trafﬁc light that remains red for, say, 40 seconds at a time.
This random variable has a uniform distribution because all waiting times between 0
and 40 seconds are equally likely.

2. The total area under the graph of f(x) is 1

the light and ﬁnd it red. Use an appropriate uniform density function to ﬁnd the prob-
ability that you will have to wait at least 15 seconds for the light to turn green.
Solution
Let X denote the random variable that measures the time (in seconds) that you must
wait. Since all waiting times between 0 and 40 are “equally likely,” X is uniformly dis-
tributed over the interval 0  x  40. The corresponding uniform density function is

A random variable that has an exponential density function is said to be
exponentially distributed. As you can see from the graph in Figure 6.14, the value
of an exponentially distributed random variable is much more likely to be small than
large. Such random variables include the life span of electronic components, the dura-
tion of telephone calls, and the interval between the arrivals of successive planes at
an airport. Here is an example.
EXAMPLE 6.3.7
Let X be a random variable that measures the duration of telephone calls in a certain
city and suppose that a probability density function for X is
where x denotes the duration (in minutes) of a randomly selected call.
a. Find the probability that a randomly selected call will last between 2 and 3 minutes.
b. Find the probability that a randomly selected call will last at least 2 minutes.
Solution
a.
b. There are two ways to compute this probability. The ﬁrst method is to evaluate
an improper integral.

You are probably already familiar with their famous “bell-shaped” graphs like the one

A useful characteristic of a random variable X is its expected value, denoted by E(X).
If a random experiment is performed repeatedly and the results are recorded, then the
arithmetic average of the recorded results will approach the expected value, so in this
sense, E(X) can be thought of as the “average” of the random variable X. Familiar
expected values of random variables include the average highway mileage for a par-
ticular car model, the average waiting time to clear security at a certain airport, and
the average life span of a particular appliance. Here is a formula for the expected
value of a continuous random variable X in terms of an integral involving its prob-

(Geometric Interpretation of Expected Value) It may help to think of
the probability density function for the random variable X as describing the dis-
tribution of mass on a beam lying along the x axis. Then the expected value of
X is the point at which the beam will balance.
■
Examples 6.3.8 and 6.3.9 illustrate how the integral formula for the expected
value of a continuous random variable may be used.

EXAMPLE 6.3.8
Find the expected value of the uniformly distributed random variable from Exam-
ple 6.3.6 with density function
Solution
In the context of Example 6.3.6, this says that the average waiting time at the red
light is 20 seconds, a conclusion that should come as no surprise since the random
variable is uniformly distributed between 0 and 40.
EXAMPLE 6.3.9
Find the expected value of the exponentially distributed random variable from Exam-
ple 6.3.7 with density function
Solution
integration by parts
That is, the average duration of telephone calls in the city in Example 6.3.7 is 2 minutes.

spy stumbles into a trap set by Scélérat and his
men. He ﬁghts back, but eventually runs out of
bullets and is forced to use his last weapon, a
special stun grenade. Pulling the pin from the
grenade, he recalls fondly the time exactly 1 year
ago that he received it along with a pair of brass
knuckles from his superior, “N”, for Valentine’s
Day. As the grenade arcs through the air toward the
enemy, he also recalls, somewhat less fondly, that
this particular kind of grenade has a 1-year warranty
and that its life span X is a random variable
exponentially distributed with density function
where t is the number of months since the
grenade left the munitions factory. Assuming the
grenade was new when the spy received it and
that it had been chosen randomly from the factory
stock, what is the probability that the spy will

SECTION 6.4
Numerical Integration
In this section, you will see some techniques you can use to approximate deﬁnite inte-
grals. Numerical methods such as these are needed when the function to be integrated
does not have an elementary antiderivative. For instance, neither 
has 
an elementary antiderivative.
If f(x) is positive on the interval a  x  b, the deﬁnite integral 
is equal to 
the area under the graph of f between x  a and x  b. As you saw in Section 5.3,
one way to approximate this area is to use n rectangles, as shown in Figure 6.16. In
particular, you divide the interval a  x  b into n equal subintervals of width
and let xj denote the beginning of the jth subinterval. The base of the
jth rectangle is the jth subinterval, and its height is f(xj). Hence, the area of the jth
rectangle is f(xj)x. The sum of the areas of all n rectangles is an approximation to
the area under the curve, so an approximation to the corresponding deﬁnite integral is
FIGURE 6.16
Approximation by rectangles.
This approximation improves as the number of rectangles increases, and you can
estimate the integral to any desired degree of accuracy by making n large enough.
However, since fairly large values of n are usually required to achieve reasonable
accuracy, approximation by rectangles is rarely used in practice.
The accuracy of the approximation improves signiﬁcantly if trapezoids are used
instead of rectangles. Figure 6.17a shows the area from Figure 6.16 approximated by
n trapezoids. Notice how much better the approximation is in this case.

The jth trapezoid is shown in greater detail in Figure 6.17b. Notice that it con-

Area of rectangle  f(xj1)x
and
it follows that
The sum of the areas of all n trapezoids is an approximation to the area under
the curve and hence an approximation to the corresponding deﬁnite integral. Thus,
This approximation formula is known as the trapezoidal rule and applies even if the
function f is not positive.

Thus, the approximation of this particular integral by the trapezoidal rule with n  10
is accurate (after round off) to two decimal places.
The difference between the true value of the integral 
and the approximation
generated by the trapezoidal rule when n subintervals are used is denoted by En.

The relatively large number of subintervals required in Example 6.4.3 to ensure accu-
racy to within 0.00005 suggests that approximation by trapezoids may not be efﬁcient
enough for some applications. There is another approximation formula, called
Simpson’s rule, which is no harder to use than the trapezoidal rule but often requires
substantially fewer calculations to achieve a speciﬁed degree of accuracy. Like the
trapezoidal rule, it is based on the approximation of the area under a curve by
columns, but unlike the trapezoidal rule, it uses parabolic arcs rather than line seg-
ments at the top of the columns.
To be more speciﬁc, the approximation of a deﬁnite integral using parabolas is based
on the following construction (illustrated in Figure 6.19 for n  6). Divide the interval
a  x  b into an even number of subintervals so that adjacent subintervals can be paired
with none left over. Approximate the portion of the graph that lies above the ﬁrst pair
of subintervals by the (unique) parabola that passes through the three points (x1, f(x1)),
(x2, f(x2)), and (x3, f(x3)) and use the area under this parabola between x1 and x3 to
approximate the corresponding area under the curve. Do the same for the remaining pairs
of subintervals and use the sum of the resulting areas to approximate the total area under
the graph. Here is the approximation formula that results from this construction.

The proof of Simpson’s rule is based on the fact that the equation of a parabola
is a polynomial of the form y  Ax2  Bx  C. For each pair of subintervals, the three
given points are used to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients A, B, and C, and the resulting polyno-
mial is then integrated to get the corresponding area. The details of the proof are
straightforward but tedious and will be omitted.

Notice that this is an excellent approximation to the true value to 6 decimal places;
namely, ln 2  0.693147.
The error estimate for Simpson’s rule uses the fourth derivative f (4)(x) in much the
same way the second derivative f (x) was used in the error estimate for the trape-
zoidal rule. Here is the estimation formula.

approximation of

Solution
From Example 6.4.5 you know that M  24, a  1, and b  2. Hence,
The goal is to ﬁnd the smallest positive (even) integer for which
Equivalently,
or
The smallest such (even) integer is n  8, and so eight subintervals are required to
ensure the desired accuracy. Compare with the result of Example 6.4.3, where we
found that 58 subintervals are required to ensure the same degree of accuracy using
the trapezoidal rule.
Numerical integration can often be used to estimate a quantity 
when all 
that is known about f(x) is a set of experimentally determined data. Here are two
examples.
EXAMPLE 6.4.7
Jack needs to know the area of his swimming pool in order to buy a pool cover,
but this is difficult because of the pool’s irregular shape. Suppose Jack makes the
measurements shown in Figure 6.20 at 4-ft intervals along the base of the pool
(all measurements are in feet). How can he use the trapezoidal rule to estimate
the area?

Solution
If Jack could ﬁnd functions f(x) for the top rim of the pool and g(x) for the bottom 
rim, then the area would be given by the deﬁnite integral 
The irregular shape makes it impossible or at least impractical to ﬁnd formulas for f
and g, but Jack’s measurements tell him that
f(0)  g(0)  0
f(4)  g(4)  9
f(8)  g(8)  10 . . . f(36)  g(36)  0
Substituting this information into the trapezoidal rule approximation and using

Thus, Jack estimates the area of the pool to be approximately 320 ft2.

If the prevailing rate of interest remains at 5% per year compounded continuously
over the 10-year term, what is a fair price for the franchise, based on the given
information?
Solution
If the rate of income ﬂow f(t) were a continuous function, a fair price for the fran-
chise might be determined by computing the present value of the income ﬂow over
the 10-year term. According to the formula developed in Section 5.5, this present value
would be given by the deﬁnite integral
since the prevailing rate of interest is 5% 
Since we don’t have such a con-
tinuous function f(t), we will use Simpson’s rule with 
and 
to estimate
the present-value integral. We ﬁnd that
Thus, the present value of the income stream over the 10-year term is approximately
$4,796 thousand dollars ($4,796,000). The company may use this estimate as a fair
asking price for the franchise.

For instance, income is entering the account at the rate of $615 per month on
the ﬁrst of May, but 2 months later, the rate of income ﬂow is only $510 per
month. Use this information together with Simpson’s rule to estimate the future
value of the income ﬂow during this 1-year period. [Hint: Recall Example 5.5.2
of Section 5.5.]

CARDIAC OUTPUT FROM DATA
When measuring cardiac output
(Example 5.6.4 of Section 5.6), physicians generally do not have a speciﬁc
formula C(t) for the concentration of dye passing through the patient’s heart.
Instead, data analysis methods are used. Suppose 5 mg of dye are injected into
a vein near a particular patient’s heart and measurements are made every 5
seconds over a 30-second period, yielding these data:

POLLUTION CONTROL
An industrial plant spills pollutant into a river. The
pollutant spreads out as it is carried downstream by the current of the river, and
3 hours later, the spill forms the pattern shown in the accompanying ﬁgure.
Measurements (in feet) across the spill are made at 5-foot intervals, as
indicated in the ﬁgure. Use this information together with the trapezoidal rule
to estimate the area of the spill.

NET PROFIT FROM DATA
On the ﬁrst day of each month, the manager
of a small company estimates the rate at which proﬁt is expected to increase
during that month. The results are listed in the accompanying table for the
ﬁrst 6 months of the year, where P(t) is the rate of proﬁt growth in
thousands of dollars per month expected during the tth month (t  1 for
January, t  6 for June). Use this information together with the trapezoidal

However, the table does not tell the complete story because many deaths
actually due to AIDS go unreported or are attributed to other causes. Let D(t)
be the function that gives the cumulative number of AIDS deaths at time t.
Then the data in the table can be thought of as rates of change of D(t) at
various times; that is, as mortality rates. For instance, the table tells us that in
1997 (t  2), AIDS deaths were increasing at the rate of 22,245 per year.
a. Assuming that D(t) is differentiable, explain why the total number of AIDS
deaths N during the period 1995–2006 is given by the integral
b. Estimate N by using the data in the table together with the trapezoidal rule to
approximate the integral in part (a).
c.
Why is the mortality function D(t) probably not differentiable? Does this in-
validate the estimate of N made in part (b)? Write a paragraph either defend-
ing or challenging the procedure used to estimate N in this problem.

When a cell is placed in a liquid
containing a solute, the solute passes through the
cell wall by diffusion. As a result, the concentration
of the solute inside the cell changes, increasing if
the concentration of the solute outside the cell is
greater than the concentration inside and
decreasing if the opposite is true. In biology,
Fick’s law asserts that the concentration of the
solute inside the cell changes at a rate that is
jointly proportional to the area of the cell wall
and the difference between the concentrations of

MODELING EPIDEMICS
An outbreak of a disease affecting a large number of people is called an epidemic
(from the Greek roots epi “upon” and demos “the people”). Mathematics plays an
important role in the study of epidemics, a discipline known as epidemiology. Math-
ematical models have been developed for epidemics of inﬂuenza, bubonic plague,
HIV, AIDS, smallpox, gonorrhea, and various other diseases. By making some sim-
plifying assumptions, we can construct a model based on differential equations, called
the S-I-R model, that is useful for making predictions about the course of an epi-
demic. Our model will be fairly straightforward, with enough simplifying assumptions
to make the mathematics accessible. Later, we will examine the assumptions, with a
view toward improving the model by making it more realistic.
To build our model, we consider an epidemic affecting a population of N people,
each of whom falls into exactly one of the following groups at time t:
Susceptibles, S(t), are people who have not yet become ill, but who could become
sick later. When a susceptible person gets sick, it is assumed to happen with no
time lag.

Infectives, I(t), are people who have the disease and can infect others. Infectives
are not quarantined and continue a normal pattern of interacting with other people.
Removeds, R(t), are people who can no longer infect others. In particular, a
recovered person cannot catch the disease again or infect others.
We assume that no people enter or leave the population (including births and deaths),
and that at time t  0, there are some susceptibles and infectives but no removeds;
that is,
N  S(t)  I(t)  R(t)
for all t  0
where
S(0)  0
I(0)  0
R(0)  0
so that S(0)  I(0)  N.
The key to modeling an epidemic or any other dynamic situation lies in the
assumptions made about rates of change. In our model, we assume that the rate at
which susceptible people are being infected at any time is proportional to the
number of contacts between susceptibles and infectives; that is, to the product SI.
Thus, the susceptible population S(t) is decreasing (becoming infected) at a rate
given by
(1)
We also assume that the rate people are being removed from the infected population
is proportional to the number of people who are infective, so that
(2)
for some number b  0. Finally, we assume that the rate at which the number of
infectives changes is the rate at which susceptibles become infective minus the rate
at which infective people are removed from the population of infectives. This means
that
(3)
with 
[In Question 1, you are asked to obtain this last rate by differentiating 
both sides of the equation I(t)  N  S(t)  R(t) with respect to t and substituting the
rates in equations (1) and (2).]
The S-I-R model consists of the three simultaneous differential equations we have
constructed; namely,
where S(t)  I(t)  R(t)  N for all t, with R(0)  0 and S(0)  0, I(0)  0. Although
we cannot explicitly solve this system to obtain simple formulas for the functions S(t),
I(t), and R(t), we can use these differential equations to help us understand the
progress of epidemics. We illustrate this by applying our S-I-R model to a historic
case, an epidemic of bubonic plague in Eyam, a village near Shefﬁeld, England,

during 1665–1666. This analysis is possible because the village quarantined itself dur-
ing the epidemic and kept sufﬁciently detailed records. We will use these records to
estimate the constants a and b in equations (1) and (2).
First, note that the constant b in equation (2) can be interpreted as the rate at
which people are removed from the population of infectives. The infective period of
the bubonic plague in Eyam was 11 days or 0.367 months. Therefore, if we measure
time t in months and assume, for simplicity, that infected people are removed from
this population at a constant rate, we can estimate b by the ratio
Next, records kept during the epidemic show that on July 19, 1666, there were 201
susceptibles and 22 infectives, while on August 19, 1666, there were 121 susceptibles
and 21 infectives. Thus, the number of susceptibles changed by 121  201  80
during this month-long period, and this change can be used to estimate 
on the day
the period began. In other words, on July 19, 1666,
Substituting into equation (1) and solving for the constant a, we ﬁnd that
It turns out that the resulting model, with the estimates we have just obtained for the
values of a and b, does a good job of estimating the actual data. Figure 1 displays
the values predicted by the model and the actual data. [This information is adapted
from Raggett (1982) and from the discussion in Brauer and Castillo-Chavez (2001).]

The S-I-R model can be used to make some general observations about the course
of epidemics. For example, unless the number of infectives increases initially, the
epidemic will never get started (since the number of infectives does not grow beyond
the initial number). In the language of calculus, an epidemic begins only if 
0  at
t  0. Examining equation (3) of the S-I-R model, we see that this happens only if
S(0) 
 c. For this reason, c is called the threshold number of susceptibles. When the
initial number of susceptibles exceeds c, the epidemic spreads; otherwise, it dies out.
For example, the records of the 1666 bubonic plague in Eyam indicate there were ini-
tially S(0)  254 susceptibles. Using our estimates of a 
 0.018 and b 
 2.72, we
estimate the threshold number for this model to be
Since S(0)  254 
 151, the model predicts that the epidemic should spread, which
is exactly what happened historically.
You probably have noticed that in constructing our S-I-R model and applying it
to the Eyam epidemic, we have made several fairly strong assumptions, not the least
of which is that S(t)  I(t)  R(t) is a constant. Is it realistic to assume that the size
of a population subjected to an epidemic would never change? Is it any more realis-
tic to assume that people become infective immediately with no time lag? Certainly
not, since diseases usually have incubation periods, but inserting a time lag to account
for the incubation period would make the resulting model too complicated to analyze
without more sophisticated mathematical tools. This illustrates the central issue fac-
ing anyone who uses mathematical modeling: a completely realistic model is often
difﬁcult if not impossible to analyze, while making assumptions to simplify the analy-
sis can lead to results that are not entirely realistic. The S-I-R model is indeed based
on several simplifying assumptions that are somewhat unrealistic, but we have also
seen that the model can be used effectively to explore the dynamics of an epidemic.
How do you think the model could be made more realistic without sacriﬁcing too
much of its simplicity?

start of the epidemic there were 762 susceptible boys and 1 infective boy, and
1 day later, two more boys became ill. Assume that anyone sick with inﬂuenza
is also infective.

model for this epidemic with t representing time in days.

they become ill. Use this information to estimate the constant b in equation (2)
of the S-I-R model for this epidemic.
c. Use the values of a and b you found in parts (a) and (b) to ﬁnd the threshold
number of susceptibles needed for this epidemic to get started.

In business, if a manufacturer determines that x units of a particular commodity can
be sold domestically for $90 per unit, and y units can be sold to foreign markets for
$110 per unit, then the total revenue obtained from all sales is given by

In psychology, a person’s intelligence quotient (IQ) is measured by the ratio
where a and m are the person’s actual age and mental age, respectively. A carpenter
constructing a storage box x feet long, y feet wide, and z feet deep knows that the
box will have volume V and surface area S, where
V  xyz
and
S  2xy  2xz  2yz
These are typical of practical situations in which a quantity of interest depends on
the values of two or more variables. Other examples include the volume of water in a
community’s reservoir, which may depend on the amount of rainfall as well as the pop-
ulation of the community, and the output of a factory, which may depend on the amount
of capital invested in the plant, the size of the labor force, and the cost of raw materials.
In this chapter, we will extend the methods of calculus to include functions of two
or more independent variables. Most of our work will be with functions of two variables,
which you will ﬁnd can be represented geometrically by surfaces in three-dimensional
space instead of curves in the plane. We begin with a deﬁnition and some terminology.

Function of Two Variables
■
A function f of the two independent
variables x and y is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair (x, y) in a given set D
(the domain of f ) exactly one real number, denoted by f(x, y).
NOTE
Domain Convention: Unless otherwise stated, we assume that the
domain of f is the set of all (x, y) for which the expression f(x, y) is deﬁned.
■
As in the case of a function of one variable, a function of two variables f(x, y)
can be thought of as a “machine” in which there is a unique “output” f(x, y) for each
“input” (x, y), as illustrated in Figure 7.1. The domain of f is the set of all possible

inputs, and the set of all possible corresponding outputs is the range of f. Functions
of three independent variables f(x, y, z) or four independent variables f(x, y, z, t), and
so on can be deﬁned in a similar fashion.
EXAMPLE 7.1.1
Suppose 
a. Find the domain of f.
b. Compute f(1, 2).
Solution
a. Since division by any real number except zero is possible, the expression f(x, y)
can be evaluated for all ordered pairs (x, y) with x  y  0 or x  y. Geometri-
cally, this is the set of all points in the xy plane except for those on the line y  x.
b.
EXAMPLE 7.1.2
Suppose f(x, y)  xey  ln x.
a. Find the domain of f.
b. Compute f(e2, ln2)
Solution
a. Since xey is deﬁned for all real numbers x and y and since lnx is deﬁned only
for x  0, the domain of f consists of all ordered pairs (x, y) of real numbers for
which x  0.
b. f(e2, ln 2)  e2eln 2  ln e2  2e2  2  2(e2  1)  16.78
EXAMPLE 7.1.3
Given the function of three variables f(x, y, z)  xy  xz  yz, evaluate f(1, 2, 5).
Solution
Substituting x  1, y  2, z  5 into the formula for f(x, y, z), we get
f(1, 2, 5)  (1)(2)  (1)(5)  (2)(5)  3
Here are four applications involving functions of several variables to business, eco-
nomics, ﬁnance, and life science.

Graphing calculators can
naturally represent functions of
a single independent variable
but require additional capabil-
ities to portray multivariate
functions, such as three-
dimensional graphing features.
A simple method to deal with
multivariate functions is to
graph one variable at speciﬁc
values of the other variables.
For example, store f(x, y) 
x3  x 2y 2  xy 3  y4 into Y1
as X^3  X^2*L1^2  X*L1^3
 L1^4, where L1 is the list of
values {0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5}.

depends not only on its own price, but also on the price of the competing brand.
Sales ﬁgures indicate that if the Williams brand sells for x dollars per racket and
the Sharapova brand for y dollars per racket, the demand for Williams rackets will be
D1  300  20x  30y rackets per year and the demand for Sharapova rackets will
be D2  200  40x  10y rackets per year. Express the store’s total annual revenue
from the sale of these rackets as a function of the prices x and y.
Solution
Let R denote the total monthly revenue. Then
R  (number of Williams rackets sold)(price per Williams racket)
 (number of Sharapova rackets sold)(price per Sharapova racket)
Hence,
R(x, y)  (300  20x  30y)(x)  (200  40x  10y)(y)
 300x  200y  70xy  20x2  10y2
Output Q at a factory is often regarded as a function of the amount K of capital
investment and the size L of the labor force. Output functions of the form
Q(K, L)  AKL
where A, , and  are positive constants with     1, have proved to be espe-
cially useful in economic analysis and are known as Cobb-Douglas production
functions.* Here is an example involving such a function.
EXAMPLE 7.1.5
Suppose that at a certain factory, output is given by the Cobb-Douglas production
function Q(K, L)  60K13L23 units, where K is the capital investment measured in
units of $1,000 and L the size of the labor force measured in worker-hours.
a. Compute the output if the capital investment is $512,000 and 1,000 worker-hours
of labor are used.
b. Show that the output in part (a) will double if both the capital investment and
the size of the labor force are doubled.
Solution
a. Evaluate Q(K, L) with K  512 (thousand) and L  1,000 to get
Q(512, 1,000)  60(512)13(1,000)23
 60(8)(100)  48,000 units
b. Evaluate Q(K, L) with K  2(512) and L  2(1,000) as follows to get
Q[2(512), 2(1,000)]  60[2(512)]13[2(1,000)]23
 60(2)13(512)13(2)23(1,000)23  96,000 units
which is twice the output when K  512 and L  1,000.

Recall (from Section 4.1) that the present value of B dollars in t years invested at the
annual rate r compounded k times per year is given by
Find the present value of $10,000 in 5 years invested at 6% per year compounded
quarterly.
Solution
We have B  10,000, r  0.06 (6% per year), k  4 (compounded 4 times per year),
and t  5, so the present value is
or approximately $7,425.
EXAMPLE 7.1.7
A population that grows exponentially satisﬁes
where P is the population at time t, A is the initial population (when t  0), and k is
the relative (per capita) growth rate. The population of a certain country is currently
5 million people and is growing at the rate of 3% per year. What will the population
be in 7 years?
Solution
Let P be measured in millions of people. Substituting A  5, k  0.03 (3% annual
growth), and t  7 into the population function, we ﬁnd that
Therefore, in 7 years, the population will be approximately 6,168,400 people.
The graph of a function of two variables f(x, y) is the set of all triples (x, y, z) such
that (x, y) is in the domain of f and z  f(x, y). To “picture” such graphs, we need to
construct a three-dimensional coordinate system. The ﬁrst step in this construction
is to add a third coordinate axis (the z axis) perpendicular to the familiar xy coordi-
nate plane, as shown in Figure 7.2. Note that the xy plane is taken to be horizontal,
and the positive z axis is “up.”

CHAPTER 7
Calculus of Several Variables

You can describe the location of a point in three-dimensional space by specify-
ing three coordinates. For example, the point that is 4 units above the xy plane and
lies directly above the point with xy coordinates (x, y)  (1, 2) is represented by the
ordered triple (x, y, z)  (1, 2, 4). Similarly, the ordered triple (2, 1, 3) represents
the point that is 3 units directly below the point (2, 1) in the xy plane. These points
are shown in Figure 7.2.
To graph a function f(x, y) of the two independent variables x and y, it is
customary to introduce the letter z to stand for the dependent variable and to write
z  f(x, y) (Figure 7.3). The ordered pairs (x, y) in the domain of f are thought of as
points in the xy plane, and the function f assigns a “height” z to each such point
(“depth” if z is negative). Thus, if f(1, 2)  4, you would express this fact geometri-
cally by plotting the point (1, 2, 4) in a three-dimensional coordinate space. The func-
tion may assign different heights to different points in its domain, and in general, its
graph will be a surface in three-dimensional space.
Four such surfaces are shown in Figure 7.4 on page 563. The surface in Figure
7.4a is a cone, Figure 7.4b shows a paraboloid, Figure 7.4c shows an ellipsoid, and
Figure 7.4d shows what is commonly called a saddle surface. Surfaces such as these
play an important role in examples and exercises in this chapter.
It is usually not easy to sketch the graph of a function of two variables. One way to
visualize a surface is shown in Figure 7.5 on page 563. Notice that when the plane
z  C intersects the surface z  f(x, y), the result is a curve in space. The correspon-
ding set of points (x, y) in the xy plane that satisfy f(x, y)  C is called the level
curve of f at C, and an entire family of level curves is generated as C varies over a
set of numbers. By sketching members of this family in the xy plane, you can obtain
a useful representation of the surface z  f(x, y).
For instance, imagine that the surface z  f(x, y) is a “mountain” whose “eleva-
tion” at the point (x, y) is given by f(x, y), as shown in Figure 7.6a on page 564. The
level curve f(x, y)  C lies directly below a path on the mountain where the eleva-
tion is always C. To graph the mountain, you can indicate the paths of constant
elevation by sketching the family of level curves in the plane and pinning a “ﬂag” to

EXAMPLE 7.1.8
Discuss the level curves of the function f(x, y)  x2  y2.
Solution
The level curve f(x, y)  C has the equation x2  y2  C. If C  0, this is the point
(0, 0), and if C  0, it is a circle of radius 
If C  0, there are no points that sat-
isfy x2  y2  C.
The graph of the surface z  x2  y2 is shown in Figure 7.7. The level curves

be shown that cross sections perpendicular to the x axis and the y axis are parabolas.

called a circular paraboloid or a paraboloid of revolution.

Level curves help to visualize the shape of a surface.
Level curves appear in many different applications. For instance, in economics, if the
output Q(x, y) of a production process is determined by two inputs x and y (say, hours
of labor and capital investment), then the level curve Q(x, y)  C is called the curve
of constant product C or, more brieﬂy, an isoquant (“iso” means “equal”).
Another application of level curves in economics involves the concept of indif-
ference curves. A consumer who is considering the purchase of a number of units of
each of two commodities is associated with a utility function U(x, y), which mea-
sures the total satisfaction (or utility) the consumer derives from having x units of
the ﬁrst commodity and y units of the second. A level curve U(x, y)  C of the util-
ity function is called an indifference curve and gives all of the combinations of x
and y that lead to the same level of consumer satisfaction. These terms are illustrated
in Example 7.1.9.
EXAMPLE 7.1.9
Suppose the utility derived by a consumer from x units of one commodity and y units
of a second commodity is given by the utility function U(x, y)  x32y. If the con-
sumer currently owns x  16 units of the ﬁrst commodity and y  20 units of the sec-
ond, ﬁnd the consumer’s current level of utility and sketch the corresponding
indifference curve.

In practical work in the social, managerial, or life sciences, you will rarely, if ever,
have to graph a function of two variables. Hence, we will spend no more time devel-
oping graphing procedures for such functions.
Computer software is now available for graphing functions of two variables. Such
software often allows you to choose different scales along each coordinate axis and
may also enable you to visualize a given surface from different viewpoints. These
features permit you to obtain a detailed picture of the graph. A variety of computer-
generated graphs are displayed in Figure 7.9.

37. RETAIL SALES
A manufacturer with exclusive
rights to a sophisticated new industrial machine is
planning to sell a limited number of the machines
to both foreign and domestic ﬁrms. The price the
manufacturer can expect to receive for the
machines will depend on the number of machines
made available. It is estimated that if the
manufacturer supplies x machines to the domestic
market and y machines to the foreign market, the
machines will sell for 
thousand dollars apiece domestically
and 50 
thousand dollars apiece abroad.
Express the revenue R as a function of x and y.

A manufacturer is planning to
sell a new product at the price of A dollars per unit

consumers will buy approximately 
units of the product. If manufacturing costs are

0.648 m2, approximately how tall would you
expect him to be?
c.
Suppose at some time in her life, Jenny weighs
six times as much and is twice as tall as she was
at birth. What is the corresponding percentage
change in the surface area of her body?
d. Ask your parents what your birth weight and
length were (they will know!). Then obtain a
doll that is approximately the same length you
were at birth, and measure its surface area. Does
the empirical formula accurately predict the

Currently the workforce consists of 10 skilled
workers and 20 unskilled workers.

consumer currently owns x  5 units of the ﬁrst
commodity and y  4 units of the second. Find
the consumer’s current level of utility and sketch

commodity and y  8 units of the second. Find
the current level of utility and sketch the
corresponding indifference curve.
44. AIR POLLUTION
Dumping and other material-
handling operations near a landﬁll may result in
contaminated particles being emitted into the
surrounding air. To estimate such particulate
emission, the following empirical formula* can be
used:

where E is the emission factor (pounds of particles
released into the air per ton of soil moved), V is
the mean speed of the wind (mph), M is the
moisture content of the material (given as a
percentage), and k is a constant that depends on
the size of the particles.
a. For a small particle (diameter 5 mm), it turns
out that k  0.2. Find E(10, 13).
b. The emission factor E can be multiplied by the
number of tons of material handled to obtain
a measure of total emissions. Suppose 19 tons
of the material in part (a) is handled. How
many tons of a second kind of material with
k  0.48 (diameter 15 mm) and moisture
content 27% must be handled to achieve the
same level of total emissions if the wind
velocity stays the same?
c.
Sketch several level curves of E(V, M), assum-
ing the size of the particle stays ﬁxed. What is
represented by these curves?
45. FLOW OF BLOOD
One of Poiseuille’s laws†
says that the speed of blood V (cm/sec) ﬂowing at
a distance r (cm) from the axis of a blood vessel
of radius R (cm) and length L (cm) is given by
where P (dynes/cm2) is the pressure in the vessel.
Suppose a particular vessel has radius 0.0075 cm
and is 1.675 cm long.
a. How fast is the blood ﬂowing at a distance
0.004 cm from the axis of this vessel if the
pressure in the vessel is 3,875 dynes/cm2?
b. Since R and L are ﬁxed for this vessel, V is a
function of P and r alone. Sketch several level
curves of V(P, r). Explain what they represent.

grams (kg) and height h in centimeters (cm).
Then, the Harris-Benedict equations say that
the daily basal energy expenditure in kilocalories is
Bm(w, h, A)  66.47  13.75w  5.00h  6.77A

50. INVENTORY
Suppose a company requires N
units per year of a certain commodity. Suppose
further that it costs D dollars to order a shipment
of the commodity and that the storage cost per unit
is S dollars per year. The units are used (or sold) at
a constant rate throughout the year, and each
shipment is used up just as a new shipment arrives.
a. Show that the total cost C(x) of maintaining
inventory when x units are ordered in each
shipment is minimized when x  Q where 
(See Example 3.5.7 in Section 3.5.)
b. The optimum order size Q found in part (a) is
called the economic order quantity (EOQ). What
is the EOQ when 9,720 units per year are or-
dered with an ordering cost of $35 per shipment

52. WIND POWER
A machine based on wind
energy generally converts the kinetic energy of
moving air to mechanical energy by means of a
device such as a rotating shaft, as in a windmill.
Suppose we have wind of velocity v traveling
through a wind-collecting machine with cross-
sectional area A. Then, in physics* it is shown that
the total power generated by the wind is given by a
formula of the form
where b  1.2 kg/m3 is the density of the air and
a is a positive constant.
a. If a wind machine were perfectly efﬁcient, then 
in the formula for P(v, A). How much 
power would be produced by such an ideal
windmill with blade radius 15 meters if the wind
speed is 22 m/sec?
b. No wind machine is perfectly efﬁcient. In fact, it
has been shown that the best we can hope for is
about 59% of ideal efﬁciency, and a good empir-
ical formula for power is obtained by taking
Compute P(v, A) using this value of a if
the blade radius of the windmill in part (a) is
doubled and the wind velocity is halved.
c.
Mankind has been trying to harness the wind for
at least 4,000 years, sometimes with interesting
or bizarre consequences. For example, in the
source quoted in the footnote, the author notes
that during World War II, a windmill was built
in Vermont with a blade radius of 175 feet!
Read an article on windmills and other devices
using wind power. Do you think these devices
have any place in the modern technological
world? Explain.

53. REVERSE OSMOSIS
In manufacturing
semiconductors, it is necessary to use water with
an extremely low mineral content, and to separate
water from contaminants, it is common practice to
use a membrane process called reverse osmosis.
A key to the effectiveness of such a process is the
osmotic pressure, which may be determined by
the van’t Hoff equation:*
P(N, C, T)  0.075NC(273.15  T)
where P is the osmotic pressure (in atmospheres),
N is the number of ions in each molecule of
solute, C is the concentration of solute (gram-
mole/liter), and T is the temperature of the solute
(°C). Find the osmotic pressure for a sodium
chloride brine solution with concentration 0.53
gram-mole/liter at a temperature of 23°C. (You
will need to know that each molecule of sodium
chloride contains two ions: NaCl  Na  Cl.)
54. Output in a certain factory is given by the Cobb-
Douglas production function Q(K, L)  57K14L34,
where K is the capital in $1,000 and L is the size
of the labor force, measured in worker-hours.

b. Note that the output Q(277, 743) is doubled when
K is doubled from 277 to 554 and L is doubled
from 743 to 1,486. In a similar manner, verify that
output is tripled when K and L are both tripled,
and that output is halved when K and L are both
halved. Does anything interesting happen if K is
doubled and L is halved? Verify your response
with your calculator.

SECTION 7.2
Partial Derivatives
In many problems involving functions of two variables, the goal is to ﬁnd the rate of
change of the function with respect to one of its variables when the other is held con-
stant. That is, the goal is to differentiate the function with respect to the particular
variable in question while keeping the other variable ﬁxed. This process is known as
partial differentiation, and the resulting derivative is said to be a partial derivative
of the function.
For example, suppose a manufacturer ﬁnds that
Q(x, y)  5x2  7xy
units of a certain commodity will be produced when x skilled workers and y unskilled
workers are employed. Then if the number of unskilled workers remains ﬁxed, the
production rate with respect to the number of skilled workers is found by differenti-
ating Q(x, y) with respect to x while holding y constant. We call this the partial derivative
of Q with respect to x and denote it by Qx(x, y); thus,
Qx(x, y)  5(2x)  7(1)y  10x  7y

574
CHAPTER 7

7-18
Similarly, if the number of skilled workers remains ﬁxed, the production rate with
respect to the number of unskilled workers is given by the partial derivative of Q
with respect to y, which is obtained by differentiating Q(x, y) with respect to y, hold-
ing x constant; that is, by
Qy(x, y)  (0)  7x(1)  7x

f(x) is deﬁned by the limit of a difference quotient; namely,
With this deﬁnition in mind, the partial derivative fx(x, y) is given by
and the partial derivative fy(x, y) by
■
No new rules are needed for the computation of partial derivatives. To compute fx,
simply differentiate f with respect to the single variable x, pretending that y is a con-
stant. To compute fy, differentiate f with respect to y, pretending that x is a constant.
Here are some examples.

Recall from Section 7.1 that functions of two variables can be represented graphi-
cally as surfaces drawn on three-dimensional coordinate systems. In particular, if
z  f(x, y), an ordered pair (x, y) in the domain of f can be identiﬁed with a point in
the xy plane and the corresponding function value z  f(x, y) can be thought of as
assigning a “height” to this point. The graph of f is the surface consisting of all points
(x, y, z) in three-dimensional space whose height z is equal to f(x, y).
The partial derivatives of a function of two variables can be interpreted geomet-
rically as follows. For each ﬁxed number y0, the points (x, y0, z) form a vertical plane

whose equation is y  y0. If z  f(x, y) and if y is kept ﬁxed at y  y0, then the cor-
responding points (x, y0, f(x, y0)) form a curve in a three-dimensional space that is
the intersection of the surface z  f(x, y) with the plane y  y0. At each point on this
curve, the partial derivative 
is simply the slope of the line in the plane y  y0 that
is tangent to the curve at the point in question. That is, 
is the slope of the tangent
line “in the x direction.” The situation is illustrated in Figure 7.10a.

Similarly, if x is kept ﬁxed at x  x0, the corresponding points (x0, y, f(x0, y))
form a curve that is the intersection of the surface z  f(x, y) with the vertical plane
x  x0. At each point on this curve, the partial derivative 
is the slope of the 
tangent line in the plane x  x0. That is, 
is the slope of the tangent line “in the y
direction.” The situation is illustrated in Figure 7.10b.
In economics, the term marginal analysis refers to the practice of using a derivative
to estimate the change in the value of a function resulting from a 1-unit increase in
one of its variables. In Section 2.5, you saw some examples of marginal analysis
involving ordinary derivatives of functions of one variable. Here is an example of
how partial derivatives can be used in a similar fashion.
EXAMPLE 7.2.4
It is estimated that the weekly output of a certain plant is given by the function
Q(x, y)  1,200x  500y  x2y  x3  y2 units, where x is the number of skilled
workers and y the number of unskilled workers employed at the plant. Currently the
workforce consists of 30 skilled workers and 60 unskilled workers. Use marginal
analysis to estimate the change in the weekly output that will result from the addi-
tion of 1 more skilled worker if the number of unskilled workers is not changed.

Solution
The partial derivative
Qx(x, y)  1,200  2xy  3x2
is the rate of change of output with respect to the number of skilled workers. For any
values of x and y, this is an approximation of the number of additional units that will
be produced each week if the number of skilled workers is increased from x to x  1
while the number of unskilled workers is kept ﬁxed at y. In particular, if the work-
force is increased from 30 skilled and 60 unskilled workers to 31 skilled and
60 unskilled workers, the resulting change in output is approximately
Qx(30, 60)  1,200  2(30)(60)  3(30)2  2,100 units
For practice, compute the exact change Q(31, 60)  Q(30, 60). Is the approxi-
mation a good one?
If Q(K, L) is the output of a production process involving the expenditure of K
units of capital and L units of labor, then the partial derivative QK(K, L) is called the
marginal productivity of capital and measures the rate at which output Q changes
with respect to capital expenditure when the labor force is held constant. Similarly,
the partial derivative QL(K, L) is called the marginal productivity of labor and mea-
sures the rate of change of output with respect to the labor level when capital expen-
diture is held constant. Example 7.2.5 illustrates one way these partial derivatives can
be used in economic analysis.

A manufacturer estimates that the monthly output at a certain factory is given by the
Cobb-Douglas function
Q(K, L)  50K0.4L0.6
where K is the capital expenditure in units of $1,000 and L is the size of the labor
force, measured in worker-hours.
a. Find the marginal productivity of capital QK and the marginal productivity of
labor QL when the capital expenditure is $750,000, and the level of labor is 991
worker-hours.
b. Should the manufacturer consider adding capital or increasing the labor level in
order to increase output?
Solution
a.
QK(K, L)  50(0.4K0.6)L0.6  20K0.6L0.6
and
QL(K, L)  50K0.4(0.6L0.4)  30K0.4L0.4
so with K  750 ($750,000) and L  991
QK(750, 991)  20(750)0.6(991)0.6  23.64
and
QL(750, 991)  30(750)0.4(991)0.4  26.84

b. From part (a), you see that an increase in 1 unit of capital (that is, $1,000)
results in an increase in output of 23.64 units, which is less than the 26.84
unit increase in output that results from a unit increase in the labor level.
Therefore, the manufacturer should increase the labor level by 1 worker-hour
(from 991 worker-hours to 992) to increase output as quickly as possible from
the current level.
Two commodities are said to be substitute commodities if an increase in the demand
for either results in a decrease in demand for the other. Substitute commodities are
competitive, like butter and margarine.
On the other hand, two commodities are said to be complementary commodities
if a decrease in the demand of either results in a decrease in the demand of the other.
An example is provided by digital cameras and recording disks. If consumers buy
fewer digital cameras, they will likely buy fewer recording disks, too.
We can use partial derivatives to obtain criteria for determining whether two com-
modities are substitute or complementary. Suppose D1( p1, p2) units of the ﬁrst com-
modity and D2( p1, p2) of the second are demanded when the unit prices of the
commodities are p1 and p2, respectively. It is reasonable to expect demand to decrease
with increasing price, so
For substitute commodities, the demand for each commodity increases with respect
to the price of the other, so
However, for complementary commodities, the demand for each decreases with
respect to the price of the other, and
Example 7.2.6 illustrates how these criteria can be used to determine whether a given
pair of commodities are complementary, substitute, or neither.
EXAMPLE 7.2.6
Suppose the demand function for ﬂour in a certain community is given by
while the corresponding demand for bread is given by
where p1 is the dollar price of a pound of ﬂour and p2 is the price of a loaf of bread.
Determine whether ﬂour and bread are substitute or complementary commodities or
neither.

Since both partial derivatives are negative for all p1 and p2, it follows that ﬂour and

Partial derivatives can themselves be differentiated. The resulting functions are called
second-order partial derivatives. Here is a summary of the deﬁnition and notation
for the four possible second-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables.

NOTE
The two partial derivatives fxy and fyx are sometimes called the mixed
second-order partial derivatives of f. Notice that the mixed partial derivatives
in Example 7.2.7 are equal. This is not an accident. It turns out that for virtually
all functions f(x, y) you will encounter in practical work, the mixed partials will
be equal; that is,
fxy  fyx
This means you will get the same answer if you ﬁrst differentiate f(x, y) with
respect to x and then differentiate the resulting function with respect to y as you
would if you performed the differentiation in the reverse order.
■
Example 7.2.8 illustrates how a second-order partial derivative can convey use-
ful information in a practical situation.
EXAMPLE 7.2.8
Suppose the output Q at a factory depends on the amount K of capital invested in the
plant and equipment and also on the size L of the labor force, measured in worker-
hours. Give an economic interpretation of the sign of the second-order partial deriv-
ative 
Solution
If 
, the marginal product of labor 
decreases as L increases. This implies 
that for a ﬁxed level of capital investment, the effect on output of one additional worker-
hour of labor is greater when the workforce is small than when the workforce is large.
Similarly, if 
, it follows that for a ﬁxed level of capital investment, the 
effect on output of one additional worker-hour of labor is greater when the workforce
is large than when it is small.
Typically, for a factory operating with an adequate workforce, the derivative 
will be negative. Can you give an economic explanation for this fact?
In many practical situations, a particular quantity is given as a function of two or
more variables, each of which can be thought of as a function of yet another vari-
able, and the goal is to ﬁnd the rate of change of the quantity with respect to this
other variable. For example, the demand for a certain commodity may depend on the
price of the commodity itself and on the price of a competing commodity, both of
which are increasing with time, and the goal may be to ﬁnd the rate of change of the
demand with respect to time. You can solve problems of this type by using the fol-
lowing generalization of the chain rule
obtained in Section 2.4.

Observe that the expression for 
is the sum of two terms, each of which can
be interpreted using the chain rule for a function of one variable. In particular,
rate of change of z with respect to t for ﬁxed y
and 
rate of change of z with respect to t for ﬁxed x
The chain rule for partial derivatives says that the total rate of change of z with respect
to t is the sum of these two “partial” rates of change. Here is a practical example
illustrating the use of the chain rule for partial derivatives.
EXAMPLE 7.2.9
A health store carries two kinds of vitamin water, brand A and brand B. Sales ﬁgures
indicate that if brand A is sold for x dollars per bottle and brand B for y dollars per
bottle, the demand for brand A will be
It is estimated that t months from now the price of brand A will be
and the price of brand B will be
At what rate will the demand for brand A be changing with respect to time 4 months
from now?
Solution
Your goal  is to ﬁnd 
when t  4. Using the chain rule, you get
When t  4,
x  2  0.05(4)  2.2
and hence,
That is, 4 months from now the monthly demand for brand A will be decreasing at

The marginal analysis approximations made earlier in Examples 7.2.4 and

EXAMPLE 7.2.10
At a certain factory, the daily output is 
units, where K denotes the
capital investment measured in units of $1,000 and L the size of the labor force
measured in worker-hours. The current capital investment is $900,000, and 1,000
worker-hours of labor are used each day. Estimate the change in output that will
result if capital investment is increased by $1,000 and labor is increased by 2
worker-hours.
Solution
Apply the approximation formula with K  900, L  1,000, K  1, and L  2

To estimate the amount of
blood that ﬂows through a patient’s lung,
cardiologists use the empirical formula
where P is a percentage of the total blood ﬂow, x
is the carbon dioxide output of the lung, y is the
arteriovenous carbon dioxide difference in the
lung, u is the carbon dioxide output of the lung,
and v is the arteriovenous carbon dioxide
difference in the other lung.
It is known that blood ﬂows into the lungs to
pick up oxygen and dump carbon dioxide, so the
arteriovenous carbon dioxide difference measures
the extent to which this exchange is accomplished.
(The actual measurement is accomplished by a
device called a cardiac shunt.) The carbon
dioxide is then exhaled from the lungs so that
oxygen-bearing air can be inhaled.
Compute the partial derivatives Px, Py, Pu, and
Pv, and give a physiological interpretation of each
derivative.

62. LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS
Suppose
the daily output Q of a factory depends on the
amount K of capital investment and on the size L
of the labor force. A law of diminishing returns
states that in certain circumstances, there is a value
L0 such that the marginal product of labor will be
increasing for L  L0 and decreasing for L  L0.
a. Translate this law of diminishing returns into
statements about the sign of a certain second-
order partial derivative.
b. Read about the principle of diminishing returns
in an economics text. Then write a paragraph
discussing the economic factors that might ac-
count for this phenomenon.

Store 37 as X and 71 as Y and evaluate to obtain
Q(37, 71). Repeat for Q(38, 71) and Q(37, 72).
b. Store the partial derivative Qx(x, y) in your calcu-
lator and evaluate Qx(37, 71). Use the result to
estimate the change in output resulting when the
workforce is increased from 37 skilled workers to
38 and the unskilled workforce stays ﬁxed at 71.
Then compare with the actual change in output,
given by the difference Q(38, 71)  Q(37, 71).
c.
Use the partial derivative Qy(x, y) to estimate
the change in output that results when the
number of unskilled workers is increased from
71 to 72 while the number of skilled workers

SECTION 7.3
Optimizing Functions of Two Variables
Suppose a manufacturer produces two DVD player models, the deluxe and the stan-
dard, and that the total cost of producing x units of the deluxe and y units of the
standard is given by the function C(x, y). How would you ﬁnd the level of production
x  a and y  b that results in minimal cost? Or perhaps the output of a certain pro-
duction process is given by Q(K, L), where K and L measure capital and labor expen-
diture, respectively. What levels of expenditure K0 and L0 result in maximum output?
In Section 3.4, you learned how to use the derivative f 
(x) to ﬁnd the largest and
smallest values of a function of a single variable f(x), and the goal of this section is to
extend those methods to functions of two variables f(x, y). We begin with a deﬁnition.
In geometric terms, there is a relative maximum of f(x, y) at P(a, b) if the sur-
face z  f(x, y) has a “peak” at the point (a, b, f(a, b)); that is, if (a, b, f(a, b)) is at
Relative Extrema
■
The function f(x, y) is said to have a relative maximum
at the point P(a, b) in the domain of f if f(a, b)  f(x, y) for all points (x, y) in a
circular disk centered at P. Similarly, if f(c, d)  f(x, y) for all points (x, y) in a
circular disk centered at Q, then f(x, y) has a relative minimum at Q(c, d).

least as high as any nearby point on the surface. Similarly, a relative minimum of
f(x, y) occurs at Q(c, d) if the point (c, d, f(c, d)) is at the bottom of a “valley,” so
(c, d, f(c, d)) is at least as low as any nearby point on the surface. For example, in
Figure 7.11, the function f(x, y) has a relative maximum at P(a, b) and a relative min-
imum at Q(c, d).
FIGURE 7.11
Relative extrema of the function f(x, y).
The points (a, b) in the domain of f(x, y) for which both fx(a, b)  0 and fy(a, b)  0
are said to be critical points of f. Like the critical numbers for functions of one variable,
these critical points play an important role in the study of relative maxima and minima.
To see the connection between critical points and relative extrema, suppose f(x, y)
has a relative maximum at (a, b). Then the curve formed by intersecting the surface
z  f(x, y) with the vertical plane y  b has a relative maximum and hence a
horizontal tangent line when x  a (Figure 7.12a). Since the partial derivative fx(a, b)
is the slope of this tangent line, it follows that fx(a, b)  0. Similarly, the curve formed
by intersecting the surface z  f(x, y) with the plane x  a has a relative maximum
when y  b (Figure 7.12b), and so fy(a, b)  0. This shows that a point at which
a function of two variables has a relative maximum must be a critical point. A similar
argument shows that a point at which a function of two variables has a relative
minimum must also be a critical point.

CHAPTER 7
Calculus of Several Variables

Here is a more precise statement of the situation.
Although all the relative extrema of a function must occur at critical points, not every
critical point of a function corresponds to a relative extremum. For example, if
f(x, y)  y2  x2, then
fx(x, y)  2x
and
fy(x, y)  2y
so fx(0, 0)  fy(0, 0)  0. Thus, the origin (0, 0) is a critical point for f(x, y), and the
surface z  y2  x2 has horizontal tangents at the origin along both the x axis and the
y axis. However, in the xz plane (where y  0) the surface has the equation z  x2,
which is a downward opening parabola, while in the yz plane (where x  0), we
have the upward opening parabola z  y2. This means that at the origin, the surface
z  y2  x2 has a relative maximum in the “x direction” and a relative minimum in
the “y direction.”
Instead of having a “peak” or a “valley” above the critical point (0, 0), the surface
z  y2  x2 is shaped like a “saddle,” as shown in Figure 7.13, and for this reason is
called a saddle surface. For a critical point to correspond to a relative extremum, the
same extreme behavior (maximum or minimum) must occur in all directions. Any
critical point (like the origin in this example) where there is a relative maximum in
one direction and a relative minimum in another direction is called a saddle point.
Here is a procedure involving second-order partial derivatives that you can use to
decide whether a given critical point is a relative maximum, a relative minimum, or
a saddle point. This procedure is the two-variable version of the second derivative
test for functions of a single variable that you saw in Section 3.2.
The Second Partials Test
Let f(x, y) be a function of x and y whose partial derivatives fx, fy, fxx, fyy, and fxy
all exist, and let D(x, y) be the function
D(x, y)  fxx(x, y) fyy(x, y)  [ fxy(x, y)]2
Step 1. Find all critical points of f(x, y); that is, all points (a, b) so that
fx(a, b)  0
and
fy(a, b)  0
Step 2. For each critical point (a, b) found in step 1, evaluate D(a, b).
Step 3. If D(a, b)  0, there is a saddle point at (a, b).
Step 4. If D(a, b)  0, compute fxx(a, b):
If fxx(a, b)  0, there is a relative minimum at (a, b).
If fxx(a, b)  0, there is a relative maximum at (a, b).
If D(a, b)  0, the test is inconclusive and f may have either a relative extremum
or a saddle point at (a, b).
The Second 
Partials Test
Saddle Points
Critical Points and Relative Extrema
■
A point (a, b) in the domain of
f(x, y) for which the partial derivatives fx and fy both exist is called a critical point
of f if both
fx(a, b)  0
and
fy(a, b)  0
If the ﬁrst-order partial derivatives of f exist at all points in some region R in
the xy plane, then the relative extrema of f in R can occur only at critical points.

Notice that there is a saddle point at the critical point (a, b) only when the
quantity D in the second partials test is negative. If D is positive, there is either a
relative maximum or a relative minimum in all directions. To decide which, you
can restrict your attention to any one direction (say, the x direction) and use the
sign of the second partial derivative fxx in exactly the same way as the single vari-
able second derivative was used in the second derivative test given in Chapter 3;
namely,

EXAMPLE 7.3.1
Find all critical points for the function f(x, y)  x2  y2 and classify each as a rela-
tive maximum, a relative minimum, or a saddle point.
Solution
Since
fx  2x
and
fy  2y
the only critical point of f is (0, 0). To test this point, use the second-order partial
derivatives
fxx  2
fyy  2
and
fxy  0
to get
D(x, y)  fxxfyy  ( fxy)2  (2)(2)  02  4
That is, D(x, y)  4 for all points (x, y) and, in particular,
D(0, 0)  4  0
Hence, f has a relative extremum at (0, 0). Moreover, since
fxx(0, 0)  2  0
it follows that the relative extremum at (0, 0) is a relative minimum. For reference,
the graph of f is sketched in Figure 7.14.

so a relative maximum occurs at (2, 0) and a saddle point at (2, 0). These results
are summarized in this table.
Solving the equations fx  0 and fy  0 simultaneously to ﬁnd the critical points
of a function of two variables is rarely as simple as in Examples 7.3.1 and 7.3.2. The
algebra in Example 7.3.3 is more typical. Before proceeding, you may wish to refer
to Appendix A2, in which techniques for solving systems of two equations in two
unknowns are discussed.
EXAMPLE 7.3.3
Find all critical points for the function f(x, y)  x3  y3  6xy and classify each as a
relative maximum, a relative minimum, or a saddle point.
Solution
Since
fx  3x2  6y
and
fy  3y2  6x
you ﬁnd the critical points of f by solving simultaneously the two equations
3x2  6y  0
and
3y2  6x  0
From the ﬁrst equation, you get 
which you can substitute into the second
equation to ﬁnd
The solutions of this equation are x  0 and x  2. These are the x coordinates of the
critical points of f. To get the corresponding y coordinates, substitute these values of 
x into the equation 
(or into either one of the two original equations). You
will ﬁnd that y  0 when x  0 and y  2 when x  2. It follows that the critical
points of f are (0, 0) and (2, 2).

Since
D(0, 0)  36[(0)(0)  1]  36  0
it follows that f has a saddle point at (0, 0). Since

and
fxx(2, 2)  6(2)  12  0
you see that f has a relative minimum at (2, 2). To summarize:
In Example 7.3.4, you will use the theory of relative extrema to solve an opti-
mization problem from economics. Actually, you will be trying to ﬁnd the absolute
maximum of a certain function, which turns out to coincide with the relative max-
imum of the function. This is typical of two-variable optimization problems in the
social and life sciences, and in this text, you can assume that a relative extremum
you find as the solution to any practical optimization problem is actually the
absolute extremum.
EXAMPLE 7.3.4
A grocery store carries two brands of cat food, a local brand that it obtains at the cost
of 30 cents per can and a well-known national brand it obtains at the cost of 40 cents
per can. The grocer estimates that if the local brand is sold for x cents per can and the
national brand for y cents per can, then approximately 70  5x  4y cans of the local
brand and 80  6x  7y cans of the national brand will be sold each day. How should
the grocer price each brand to maximize total daily proﬁt from the sale of cat food?

29. RESPONSE TO STIMULI
Consider an
experiment in which a subject performs a task
while being exposed to two different stimuli (for
example, sound and light). For low levels of the
stimuli, the subject’s performance might actually
improve, but as the stimuli increase, they
eventually become a distraction and the
performance begins to deteriorate. Suppose in a
certain experiment in which x units of stimulus A
and y units of stimulus B are applied, the
performance of a subject is measured by the
function
where C is a positive constant. How many units
of each stimulus result in maximum performance?
30. SOCIAL CHOICES
The social desirability of an
enterprise often involves making a choice between
the commercial advantage of the enterprise and
the social or ecological loss that may result. For
instance, the lumber industry provides paper
products to society and income to many workers
and entrepreneurs, but the gain may be offset by
the destruction of habitable territory for spotted
owls and other endangered species. Suppose the
social desirability of a particular enterprise is
measured by the function
D(x, y)  (16  6x)x  (y2  4xy  40)
where x measures commercial advantage (proﬁt
and jobs) and y measures ecological disadvantage
(species displacement, as a percentage) with
x  0 and y  0. The enterprise is deemed
desirable if D  0 and undesirable if D  0.

sirability? Interpret your result. Is it possible for
this enterprise to be desirable?

these choices should be made.*

where k is a physical constant. If the volume of
the box satisﬁes xyz  V0 for constant V0, ﬁnd the
values of x, y, and z that minimize the ground
state energy.
32. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS
A manufacturer is
planning to sell a new product at the price of $210
per unit and estimates that if x thousand dollars is
spent on development and y thousand dollars is 
spent on promotion, consumers will buy  
approximately 
units of the product. 
If manufacturing costs for this product are $135
per unit, how much should the manufacturer
spend on development and how much on
promotion to generate the largest possible proﬁt
from the sale of this product? [Hint: Proﬁt 

industrial machine is planning to sell a limited
number of the machines to both foreign and
domestic ﬁrms. The price the manufacturer can
expect to receive for the machines will depend
on the number of machines made available. (For
example, if only a few of the machines are
placed on the market, competitive bidding among
prospective purchasers will tend to drive the price
up.) It is estimated that if the manufacturer
supplies x machines to the domestic market 
and y machines to the foreign market, the 
machines will sell for 
thousand dol-
lars apiece domestically and for 
thousand dollars apiece abroad. If the manufacturer

exponentially. Speciﬁcally, the temperature at each point located r units from
the central axis of a tumor and z units inside the tumor is given by a formula

The beautiful
patterns on the wings of butterﬂies have long
been a subject of curiosity and scientiﬁc study.
Mathematical models used to study these patterns
often focus on determining the level of morphogen
(a chemical that effects change). In a model
dealing with eyespot patterns,* a quantity of
morphogen is released from an eyespot and the
morphogen concentration t days later is given by
where r measures the radius of the region on the
wing affected by the morphogen, and k and  are
positive constants.

SECTION 7.4
The Method of Least-Squares
Throughout this text, you have seen applied functions, many of which are derived
from published research, and you may have wondered how researchers come up with
such functions. A common procedure for associating a function with an observed
physical phenomenon is to gather data, plot it on a graph, and then ﬁnd a function
whose graph “best ﬁts” the data in some mathematically meaningful way. We will
now develop such a procedure, called the method of least-squares or regression
analysis, which was ﬁrst mentioned in Example 1.3.7 of Section 1.3, in connection
with ﬁtting a line to unemployment data.
Suppose you wish to ﬁnd a function y  f(x) that ﬁts a particular data set reasonably
well. The ﬁrst step is to decide what type of function to try. Sometimes this can
be done by a theoretical analysis of the observed phenomenon and sometimes by
inspecting the plotted data. Two sets of data are plotted in Figure 7.16. These are
called scatter diagrams. In Figure 7.16a, the points lie roughly along a straight line,
suggesting that a linear function y  mx  b be used. However, in Figure 7.16b, the
points appear to follow an exponential curve, and a function of the form y  Aekx
would be more appropriate.
FIGURE 7.16
Two scatter diagrams.
Once the type of function has been chosen, the next step is to determine the
particular function of this type whose graph is “closest” to the given set of points.
A convenient way to measure how close a curve is to a set of points is to com-
pute the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the curve.
In Figure 7.17, for example, this is the sum 
The closer the curve is
to the points, the smaller this sum will be, and the curve for which this sum is
smallest is said to best ﬁt the data according to the least-squares criterion.
The use of the least-squares criterion to ﬁt a linear function to a set of points is
illustrated in Example 7.4.1. The computation involves the technique from Section 7.3
for minimizing a function of two variables.

EXAMPLE 7.4.1
Use the least-squares criterion to ﬁnd the equation of the line that is closest to the
three points (1, 1), (2, 3), and (4, 3).
Solution
As indicated in Figure 7.18, the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the
three given points to the line y  mx  b is
This sum depends on the coefﬁcients m and b that deﬁne the line, and so the sum can
be thought of as a function S(m, b) of the two variables m and b. The goal, therefore,
is to ﬁnd the values of m and b that minimize the function
S(m, b)  (m  b  1)2  (2m  b  3)2  (4m  b  3)2

THE METHOD OF LEAST-SQUARES

It can be shown that the critical point 
does indeed minimize the func-
tion S(m, b), and so it follows that
is the equation of the line that is closest to the three given points.
The line that is closest to a set of points according to the least-squares criterion is
called the least-squares line for the points. (The term regression line is also used,
especially in statistical work.) The procedure used in Example 7.4.1 can be general-
ized to give formulas for the slope m and the y intercept b of the least-squares line for
an arbitrary set of n points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn). The formulas involve sums
of the x and y values. All the sums run from j  1 to j  n, and to simplify the

The least-squares line (or curve) that best ﬁts the data collected in the past can
be used to make rough predictions about the future. This is illustrated in Exam-
ple 7.4.3.
EXAMPLE 7.4.3
A college admissions ofﬁcer has compiled these data relating students’ high school
and college grade-point averages:

Find the equation of the least-squares line for these data and use it to predict the col-
lege GPA of a student whose high school GPA is 3.7.
Solution
Let x denote the high school GPA and y the college GPA and arrange the calculations
as follows:
Use the least-squares formula with n  8 to get
and
The equation of the least-squares line is therefore
y  0.78x  0.19
To predict the college GPA y of a student whose high school GPA x is 3.7,
substitute x  3.7 into the equation of the least-squares line. This gives
y  0.78(3.7)  0.19  3.08
which suggests that the student’s college GPA might be about 3.1.

FIGURE 7.19
The least-squares line for high school and college GPAs.
The original data are plotted in Figure 7.19, together with the least-squares line
y  0.78x  0.19. Actually, in practice, it is a good idea to plot the data before pro-
ceeding with the calculations. By looking at the graph you will usually be able to tell
whether approximation by a straight line is appropriate or whether a better ﬁt might
be possible with a curve of some sort.
In each of Examples 7.4.1, 7.4.2, and 7.4.3, the least-squares criterion was used to ﬁt
a linear function to a set of data. With appropriate modiﬁcations, the procedure can
also be used to ﬁt nonlinear functions to data. One kind of modiﬁed curve-ﬁtting pro-
cedure is illustrated in Example 7.4.4.
EXAMPLE 7.4.4
A manufacturer gathers these data relating the level of production x (hundred units)
of a particular commodity to the demand price p (dollars per unit) at which all x units
will be sold:
a. Plot a scatter diagram for the data on a graph with production level on the x axis
and demand price on the y axis.
b. Notice that the scatter diagram in part (a) suggests that the demand function
is exponential. Modify the least-squares procedure to ﬁnd a curve of the form
p  Aemx that best ﬁts the data in the table.
c. Use the exponential demand function you found in part (b) to predict the revenue
the manufacturer should expect if 4,000 (x  40) units are produced.

Solution
a. The scatter diagram is plotted in Figure 7.20.
FIGURE 7.20
A scatter diagram for the demand data in Example 7.4.4.
b. Taking logarithms on both sides of the equation p  Aemx, we ﬁnd that
ln p  ln(Aemx)
 ln A  ln(emx)
 ln A  mx
or equivalently, y  mx  b, where y  ln p and b  ln A. Thus, to ﬁnd the curve
of the form p  Aemx that best ﬁts the given data points (xk, pk) for k  1, . . . , 6,
we ﬁrst ﬁnd the least-squares line y  mx  b for the data points (xk, ln pk).
Arrange the calculations as follows:
Use the least-squares formula with n  6 to get

and
which means the least-squares line has the equation
y  0.08x  7.09
Finally, returning to the exponential curve p  Aemx, recall that ln A  b, so that
ln A  b  7.09
A  e7.09  1,200
Thus, the exponential function that best ﬁts the given demand data is
p  Aemx  1,200e0.08x
c. Using the exponential demand function p  1,200e0.08x found in part (b), we
ﬁnd that when x  40 (hundred) units are produced, they can all be sold at a unit
price of
p  1,200e0.08(40)  $48.91
Therefore, when 4,000 (x  40) units are produced, we would expect the revenue
generated to be approximately
R  xp(x)  (4,000 units)($48.91 per unit)
 $195,640
The procedure illustrated in Example 7.4.4 is sometimes called log-linear
regression. A curve of the form y  Axk that best ﬁts given data can also be found
by log-linear regression. The speciﬁc procedure is outlined in Exercise 32, where it
is used to verify an allometric formula ﬁrst mentioned in the Think About It essay at
the end of Chapter 1.
The least-squares procedure can also be used to ﬁt other nonlinear functions to
data. For instance, to ﬁnd the quadratic function y  Ax2  Bx  C whose graph (a
parabola) best ﬁts a particular set of data, you would proceed as in Example 7.4.1,
minimizing the sum of squares of vertical distances from the given points to the graph.
Such computations are algebraically complicated and usually require the use of a com-
puter or graphing calculator.

The determination of relationships between measurements
of various parts of a particular organism is a topic of interest in the branch
of biology called allometry.* (Recall the Think About It essay at the end of
Chapter 1.) Suppose a biologist observes that the shoulder height h and
antler size w of an elk, both in centimeters (cm), are related as indicated in
this table:

related.

Constrained Optimization: The Method
of Lagrange Multipliers
In many applied problems, a function of two variables is to be optimized subject to a
restriction or constraint on the variables. For example, an editor, constrained to stay within
a ﬁxed budget of $60,000, may wish to decide how to divide this money between devel-
opment and promotion in order to maximize the future sales of a new book. If x denotes
the amount of money allocated to development, y the amount allocated to promotion, and
f(x, y) the corresponding number of books that will be sold, the editor would like to max-
imize the sales function f(x, y) subject to the budgetary constraint that x  y  60,000.
For a geometric interpretation of the process of optimizing a function of two
variables subject to a constraint, think of the function itself as a surface in three-
dimensional space and of the constraint (which is an equation involving x and y) as
a curve in the xy plane. When you ﬁnd the maximum or minimum of the function
subject to the given constraint, you are restricting your attention to the portion of the
surface that lies directly above the constraint curve. The highest point on this portion
of the surface is the constrained maximum, and the lowest point is the constrained
minimum. The situation is illustrated in Figure 7.21.
FIGURE 7.21
Constrained and unconstrained extrema.
You have already seen some constrained optimization problems in Chapter 3. (For
instance, recall Example 3.5.1 of Section 3.5.) The technique you used in Chapter 3
to solve such a problem involved reducing it to a problem of a single variable by
solving the constraint equation for one of the variables and then substituting the

resulting expression into the function to be optimized. The success of this technique
depended on solving the constraint equation for one of the variables, which is often
difﬁcult or even impossible to do in practice. In this section, you will see a more ver-
satile technique called the method of Lagrange multipliers, in which the introduc-
tion of a third variable (the multiplier) enables you to solve constrained optimization
problems without ﬁrst solving the constraint equation for one of the variables.
More speciﬁcally, the method of Lagrange multipliers uses the fact that any rel-
ative extremum of the function f(x, y) subject to the constraint g(x, y)  k must occur
at a critical point (a, b) of the function
F(x, y)  f(x, y)  [g(x, y)  k]
where  is a new variable (the Lagrange multiplier). To ﬁnd the critical points of
F, compute its partial derivatives
Fx  fx  gx
Fy  fy  gy
F  (g  k)
and solve the equations Fx  0, Fy  0, and F  0 simultaneously, as follows:
Fx  fx  gx  0
or
fx  gx
Fy  fy  gy  0
or
fy  gy
F  (g  k)  0
or
g  k
Finally, evaluate f(a, b) at each critical point (a, b) of F.
NOTE
The method of Lagrange multipliers tells you only that any constrained
extrema must occur at critical points of the function F(x, y). The method cannot
be used to show that constrained extrema exist or to determine whether any par-
ticular critical point (a, b) corresponds to a constrained maximum, a minimum,
or neither. However, for the functions considered in this text, you can assume that
if f has a constrained maximum (minimum) value, it will be given by the largest
(smallest) of the critical values f(a, b).
■
Here is a summary of the Lagrange multiplier procedure for ﬁnding the largest
and smallest values of a function of two variables subject to a constraint.
The Method of Lagrange Multipliers
Step 1. (Formulation) Find the largest (or smallest) value of f(x, y) subject to
the constraint g(x, y)  k, assuming that this extreme value exists.
Step 2. Compute the partial derivatives fx, fy, gx, and gy, and ﬁnd all numbers 
x  a, y  b, and  that satisfy the system of equations
fx(a, b)  gx(a, b)
fy(a, b)  gy(a, b)
g(a, b)  k
These are the Lagrange equations.
Step 3. Evaluate f at each point (a, b) that satisﬁes the system of equations in
step 2.
Step 4.
(Interpretation) If f(x, y) has a largest (smallest) value subject to the con-
straint g(x, y)  k, it will be the largest (smallest) of the values found in
step 3.

CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION: THE METHOD OF LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS

A geometric justiﬁcation of the multiplier method is given at the end of this sec-
tion. In Example 7.5.1, the method is used to solve the problem from Example 3.5.1
in Section 3.5.
EXAMPLE 7.5.1
The highway department is planning to build a picnic area for motorists along a major
highway. It is to be rectangular with an area of 5,000 square yards and is to be fenced
off on the three sides not adjacent to the highway. What is the least amount of fenc-
ing that will be needed to complete the job?
Solution
Label the sides of the picnic area as indicated in Figure 7.22 and let f denote the
amount of fencing required. Then,
f(x, y)  x  2y
The goal is to minimize f given the requirement that the area must be 5,000 square
yards; that is, subject to the constraint
g(x, y)  xy  5,000
Find the partial derivatives
fx  1
fy  2
gx  y
and
gy  x
and obtain the three Lagrange equations
1  y
2  x
and
xy  5,000
From the ﬁrst and second equations you get
(since y  0 and x  0), which implies that
Now substitute x  2y into the third Lagrange equation to get
2y2  5,000
or
y  50
and use y  50 in the equation x  2y to get x  100. Thus, x  100 and y  50
are the values that minimize the function f(x, y)  x  2y subject to the constraint
xy  5,000. The optimal picnic area is 100 yards wide (along the highway),
extends 50 yards back from the road, and requires 100  50  50  200 yards of
fencing.

CHAPTER 7
Calculus of Several Variables
7-60
Solution
Let g(x, y)  x2  y2 and use the partial derivatives
fx  y
fy  x
gx  2x
and
gy  2y
to get the three Lagrange equations
y  2x
x  2y
and
x2  y2  8
Neither x nor y can be zero if all three of these equations are to hold (do you see
why?), and so you can rewrite the ﬁrst two equations as
which implies that
Now substitute x2  y2 into the third equation to get
2x2  8
or
x  2
If x  2, it follows from the equation x2  y2 that y  2 or y  2. Similarly, if
x  2, it follows that y  2 or y  2. Hence, the four points at which the con-
strained extrema can occur are (2, 2), (2, 2), (2, 2), and (2, 2). Since
f(2, 2)  f(2, 2)  4
and
f(2, 2)  f(2, 2)  4
it follows that when x2  y2  8, the maximum value of f(x, y) is 4, which occurs
at the points (2, 2) and (2, 2), and the minimum value is 4, which occurs at
(2, 2) and (2, 2).
For practice, check these answers by solving the optimization problem using the
methods of Chapter 3.
NOTE
In Examples 7.5.1 and 7.5.2, the ﬁrst two Lagrange equations were used
to eliminate the new variable , and then the resulting expression relating x and
y was substituted into the constraint equation. For most constrained optimization
problems you encounter, this particular sequence of steps will often lead quickly
to the desired solution.
■
A utility function U(x, y) measures the total satisfaction or utility a consumer receives
from having x units of one particular commodity and y units of another. Example
7.5.3 illustrates how the method of Lagrange multipliers can be used to determine
how many units of each commodity the consumer should purchase to maximize util-
ity while staying within a ﬁxed budget.
EXAMPLE 7.5.3
A consumer has $600 to spend on two commodities, the ﬁrst of which costs $20 per
unit and the second $30 per unit. Suppose that the utility derived by the consumer
from x units of the ﬁrst commodity and y units of the second commodity is given by
the Cobb-Douglas utility function U(x, y)  10x0.6y0.4. How many units of each
commodity should the consumer buy to maximize utility?

Solution
The total cost of buying x units of the ﬁrst commodity at $20 per unit and y units of
the second commodity at $30 per unit is 20x  30y. Since the consumer has only
$600 to spend, the goal is to maximize utility U(x, y) subject to the budgetary con-
straint 20x  30y  600.
The three Lagrange equations are
6x0.4y0.4  20
4x0.6y0.6  30
and
20x  30y  600
From the ﬁrst two equations you get
Substituting y 
into the third Lagrange equation, you get
so that
That is, to maximize utility, the consumer should buy 18 units of the ﬁrst commod-
ity and 8 units of the second.

Recall from Section 7.1 that the level curves of a utility function are known
as indifference curves. A graph showing the relationship between the optimal indif-
ference curve U(x, y)  C, where C  U(18, 8) and the budgetary constraint
20x  30y  600, is sketched in Figure 7.23.
An important class of problems in business and economics involves determining
an optimal allocation of resources subject to a constraint on those resources. Here is an
example in which production is maximized subject to a cost constraint.
EXAMPLE 7.5.4
A manufacturer has $600,000 to spend on the production of a certain product and
determines that if x units of capital and y units of labor are allocated to production,
then P units will be produced, where P is given by the Cobb-Douglas production
function
Suppose each unit of labor costs $3,000 and each unit of capital costs $5,000. How
many units of labor and capital should be allocated in order to maximize production?
Solution
The cost of capital is 3,000x and the cost of labor is 5,000y, so the total cost of
resources is g(x, y)  3,000x  5,000y. The goal is to maximize the production func-
tion P(x, y)  120x4/5y1/5 subject to the cost constraint g(x, y)  600,000. The cor-
responding Lagrange equations are
and
or, equivalently,
Solving for  in the ﬁrst two equations, we get
Multiply both sides of this equation by x15 y45 to obtain
so

Thus,

That is, to maximize production, the manufacturer should allocate 160 units to capi-
tal and 24 units to labor. If this is done,
will be produced.
A graph showing the relationship between the cost constraint and the level
curve for optimal production is shown in Figure 7.24.

Usually, solving a constrained optimization problem by the method of Lagrange mul-

EXAMPLE 7.5.5
Suppose the manufacturer is given an extra $1,000 to spend on capital and labor for
the production of the commodity in Example 7.5.4; that is, a total of $601,000. Esti-
mate the effect on the maximum production level.
Solution
In Example 7.5.4, we found the maximum value M of the production function 
P(x, y)  120x4/5 y1/5 subject to the cost constraint 3,000x  5,000y  600,000 by solving
the three Lagrange equations
to obtain x  160 and y  24 and the maximum production level
The multiplier  can be found by substituting these values of x and y into either
the ﬁrst or second Lagrange equation. Using the ﬁrst equation, we ﬁnd that
This means that the maximum production with the new cost constraint increases by
approximately 0.0219 units for each $1 increase in the constraint. Since the constraint
increases by $1,000, the maximum production increases by approximately
(0.0219)(1,000)  21.9 units
that is, to
13,138  21.9  13,159.9 units
To check, if we repeat Example 7.5.4 with the revised constraint,
3,000x  5,000y  601,000
it can be shown that he maximum occus when x  160.27 and y  24.04 (verify this
result), so the maximum productivity is
This is essentially the estimate obtained using the Lagrange multiplier.
NOTE
A problem like Example 7.5.4, where production is maximized subject
to a cost constraint, is called a ﬁxed budget problem (see Exercise 45). In the
context of such a problem, the Lagrange multiplier  is called the marginal
productivity of money. Similarly, the multiplier in a utility problem like that in
Examplc 7.5.3 is called the marginal utility of money (see Exercise 41).
■
The method of Lagrange multipliers can be extended to constrained optimization prob-
lems involving functions of more than two variables and more than one constraint.
For instance, to optimize f(x, y, z) subject to the constraint g(x, y, z)  k, you solve
fx  gx
fy  gy
fz  gz
and
g  k

A jewelry box is to be constructed of material that costs $1 per square inch for the
bottom, $2 per square inch for the sides, and $5 per square inch for the top. If the total
volume is to be 96 in.3, what dimensions will minimize the total cost of construction?
Solution
Let the box be x inches deep, y inches long, and z inches wide where x, y, and z are
all positive, as indicated in the accompanying ﬁgure. Then the volume of the box is

Thus, the minimal cost occurs when the jewelry box is 6 inches deep with a square
base, 4 inches on a side.
Although a rigorous explanation of why the method of Lagrange multipliers
works involves advanced ideas beyond the scope of this text, there is a rather simple
geometric argument that you should ﬁnd convincing. This argument depends on the
fact that for the level curve F(x, y)  C, the slope at each point (x, y) is given by
provided Fy  0. We obtained this formula using the chain rule for partial deriva-
tives in Exercise 80 in Section 7.2. Exercises 54 and 55 illustrate the use of this
formula.
Now, consider the constrained optimization problem:
Maximize f(x, y) subject to g(x, y)  k
Geometrically, this means you must ﬁnd the highest level curve of f that intersects the
constraint curve g(x, y)  k. As Figure 7.25 suggests, the critical intersection will occur
at a point where the constraint curve is tangent to a level curve; that is, where the slope
of the constraint curve g(x, y)  k is equal to the slope of a level curve f(x, y)  C.

SECTION 7.6
Double Integrals 
In Chapters 5 and 6, you integrated a function of one variable f(x) by reversing the
process of differentiation, and a similar procedure can be used to integrate a function of
two variables f(x, y). However, since two variables are involved, we shall integrate f(x, y)
by holding one variable ﬁxed and integrating with respect to the other.
For instance, to evaluate the partial integral 
you would integrate with
respect to x, using the fundamental theorem of calculus with y held constant:

Similarly, to evaluate 
you integrate with respect to y, holding x constant:
In general, partially integrating a function f(x, y) with respect to x results in a
function of y alone, which can then be integrated as a function of a single variable,
thus producing what we call an iterated integral
Similarly, the
iterated integral 
is obtained by ﬁrst integrating with respect to y,
holding x constant, and then with respect to x. Returning to our example, you ﬁnd,
and
In our example, the two iterated integrals turned out to have the same value, and
you can assume this will be true for all iterated integrals considered in this text. The
double integral of f(x, y) over a rectangular region in the xy plane has the following
deﬁnition in terms of iterated integrals.

On the other hand, if you use y integration ﬁrst, both computations are easy:
In each of the preceding examples, the region of integration is a rectangle, but dou-
ble integrals can also be deﬁned over nonrectangular regions. Before doing so, how-
ever, we will introduce an efﬁcient procedure for describing certain such regions in
terms of inequalities.
The region R shown in Figure 7.26 is bounded below by the curve y  g1(x), above
by the curve y  g2(x), and on the sides by the vertical lines x  a and x  b. This
region can be described by the inequalities
R: a  x  b, g1(x)  y  g2(x)
The ﬁrst inequality speciﬁes the interval in which x must lie, while the second indi-
cates the lower and upper bounds of the vertical cross section of R for each x in this
interval. In words:
R is the region such that for each x between a and b,
y varies from g1(x) to g2(x).

This method for describing a region is illustrated in Example 7.6.3.

R: a  x  b, g1(x)  y  g2(x)
EXAMPLE 7.6.3
Let R be the region bounded by the curve y  x2 and the line y  2x. Use inequal-
ities to describe R in terms of its vertical cross sections.
Solution
Begin with a sketch of the curve and line as shown in Figure 7.27. Identify the region
R, and, for reference, draw a vertical cross section. Solve the equations y  x2 and
y  2x simultaneously to ﬁnd the points of intersection, (0, 0) and (2, 4). Observe
that in the region R, the variable x takes on all values from x  0 to x  2 and that
for each such value of x, the vertical cross section is bounded below by y = x2 and
above by y  2x. Hence, R can be described by the inequalities
0  x  2
and
x2  y  2x

Graph the region over which
the double integral is being

Store y  x2 into Y1 and 
y  2x into Y2 of the equation
editor and graph using the
window [0.15, 2.2]1 by

the intersection-ﬁnding feature
of your calculator to locate the
intersection points of Y1 and
Y2. Use the vertical line feature
of your calculator to display
the vertical cross sections over

performed.

The region R in Figure 7.28 is bounded on the left by the curve x  h1(y), on the
right by x  h2(y), below by the horizontal line y  c, and above by y  d. This
region can be described by the pair of inequalities
R: c  y  d, h1(y)  x  h2(y)
The ﬁrst inequality speciﬁes the interval in which y must lie, and the second indicates
the left-hand (“trailing”) and right-hand (“leading”) bounds of a horizontal cross sec-
tion. In words:
R is the region such that for each y between c and d,
x varies from h1(y) to h2(y).
FIGURE 7.28
Horizontal cross sections. The region
R: c  y  d, h1(y)  x  h2(y)
This method of description is illustrated in Example 7.6.4 for the same region
described using vertical cross sections in Example 7.6.3.
EXAMPLE 7.6.4
Describe the region R bounded by the curve y  x2 and the line y  2x in terms of
inequalities using horizontal cross sections.
Solution
As in Example 7.6.3, sketch the region and ﬁnd the points of intersection of the line
and curve, but this time draw a horizontal cross section (Figure 7.29).
In the region R, the variable y takes on all values from y  0 to y  4. For each
such value of y, the horizontal cross section extends from the line y  2x on the left
to the curve y  x2 on the right. Since the equation of the line can be rewritten as
and the equation of the curve as 
, the inequalities describing R in
terms of its horizontal cross sections are

Thus, if y is a number in the interval 0  y  1, the horizontal cross section of R at y
extends from x  0 on the left to x  y on the right. The region is the triangle shown
in Figure 7.30a. As shown in Figure 7.30b, the same region R can be described by tak-
ing vertical cross sections at each number x in the interval 0  x  1 that are bounded
below by y  x and above by y  1. Expressed in terms of inequalities, this means that
R: 0  x  1, x  y  1

Next, we will examine a few applications of double integrals, all of which are gen-
eralizations of familiar applications of deﬁnite integrals of functions of one variable.
Speciﬁcally, we will see how double integration can be used to compute area, vol-
ume, and average value.
The area of a region R in the xy plane can be computed as the double integral over
R of the constant function f(x, y) = 1.

The area of a region R in the xy plane is given by the formula

To get a feel for why the area formula holds, consider the elementary region R
shown in Figure 7.31, which is bounded above by the curve y  g2(x) and below
by the curve y  g1(x), and which extends from x  a to x  b. According to the
double-integral formula for area,
which is precisely the formula for the area between two curves that you saw in Sec-
tion 5.4. Here is an example illustrating the use of the area formula.

Recall from Section 5.3 that the region under the curve y  f(x) over an interval
a  x  b, where f(x) is continuous and f(x)  0, has area given by the deﬁnite integral
. An analogous argument for a continuous, nonnegative function of two

volume given by

EXAMPLE 7.6.7
A biomass covers the triangular bottom of a container with vertices (0, 0), (6, 0), and
(3, 3), to a depth h(x, y) 
at each point (x, y) in the region, where all dimen-
sions are in centimeters. What is the total volume of the biomass?
Solution
The volume is given by the double integral 
where R is the triangular
region R shown in Figure 7.33.

FIGURE 7.33
The volume of a biomass.
Note that this region is bounded by the x axis (y  0), and the lines x  y and
x  y  6, so it can be described as
R: 0  y  3, y  x  6  y
Therefore, the volume of the biomass is given by
We conclude that the volume of the biomass is approximately 9.5 cm3.
In Section 5.4, you saw that the average value of a function f(x) over an interval 
a  x  b is given by the integral formula
That is, to ﬁnd the average value of a function of one variable over an interval,
you integrate the function over the interval and divide by the length of the inter-
val. The two-variable procedure is similar. In particular, to ﬁnd the average value
of a function of two variables f(x, y) over a region R, you integrate the function
over R and divide by the area of R.

In a certain factory, output is given by the Cobb-Douglas production function
where K is the capital investment in units of $1,000 and L is the size of the labor
force measured in worker-hours. Suppose that monthly capital investment varies
between $10,000 and $12,000, while monthly use of labor varies between 2,800 and
3,200 worker-hours. Find the average monthly output for the factory.
Solution
It is reasonable to estimate the average monthly output by the average value of
Q(K, L) over the rectangular region 
The region
has area
so the average output is
Thus, the average monthly output is approximately 5,181 units.

MEDICINE
A certain disease can be treated by
administering at least 70 units of drug C, but that
level of medication sometimes results in serious
side effects. Looking for a safer approach, a
physician decides instead to use drugs A and B,
which result in no side effects as long as their
combined dosage is less than 60 units. Moreover,
she determines that when x units of drug A and y
units of drug B are administered to a patient, the
effect is equivalent to administering E units of
drug C, where
E  0.05(xy  2x2  y2  95x  20y)

the capital investment measured in units of $1,000
and L denotes the size of the labor force measured
in worker-hours. Suppose that the current capital
investment is $125,000 and that 900 worker-hours
of labor are used each day. Use marginal analysis
to estimate the effect that an additional capital
investment of $1,000 will have on the daily output
if the size of the labor force is not changed.
30. In economics, the marginal product of labor is the
rate at which output Q changes with respect to
labor L for a ﬁxed level of capital investment K.
An economic law states that, under certain
circumstances, the marginal product of labor
increases as the level of capital investment
increases. Translate this law into a mathematical
statement involving a second-order partial

If manufacturing costs for the product are $150 per

development and how much on promotion to
generate the largest possible proﬁt if unlimited
funds are available?

MODELING POPULATION DIFFUSION
In 1905, ﬁve muskrats were accidentally released near Prague in the current Czech
Republic. Subsequent to 1905, the range of the muskrat population expanded and the
front (the outer limit of the population) moved as indicated in Figure 1. In the ﬁgure,
the closed curves labeled with dates are equipopulation contours; that is, curves of
constant, minimally detectable populations of muskrats. For instance, the curve
labeled 1920 indicates that the muskrat population had expanded from Prague to the
gates of Vienna in the 15 years after their release. A population dispersion such as
this can be studied using mathematical models based on partial differential equations;
that is, equations involving functions of two or more variables and their partial deriv-
atives. We will examine such a model and then return to our illustration to see how
well the model can be used to describe the dispersion of the muskrats.

The model we will discuss is based on the diffusion equation, an extremely ver-
satile partial differential equation with important applications in the physical and life
sciences as well as economics. Diffusion is the name used for the process by which
particles spread out as they continually collide and randomly change direction after
being inserted at a source. Suppose the particles can only move in one spatial direc-
tion (say, along a thin rod or tube). Then C(x, t), the concentration of particles at
time t located x units from the source (the point of insertion), satisﬁes the one-
dimensional diffusion equation

where  is a positive constant called the diffusion coefﬁcient. Similarly, the two-
dimensional diffusion equation
is used to model the dispersion of particles moving randomly in a plane, where
C(x, y, t) is the concentration of particles at the point (x, y) at time t.
Mathematical biologists have adapted the diffusion equation to model the spread
of living organisms, including both plants and animals. We will examine such a model,
due to J. G. Skellam. First, suppose that at a particular time (t  0), an organism is
introduced at a point (called a “source”), where it had previously not been present. Skel-
lam assumed that the population of the organism disperses from the source in two ways:
a. By growing exponentially at the continuous reproduction rate r.
b. By moving randomly in an xy coordinate plane, with the source at the origin.
Based on these assumptions, he then modeled the dispersion of the population by the
modiﬁed two-dimensional diffusion equation

where N(x, y, t) is the population density at the point (x, y) at time t, and D is a pos-
itive constant, called the dispersion coefﬁcient, that is analogous to the diffusion
coefﬁcient.
It can be shown that one solution of Skellam’s equation is
(2)
where M is the number of individuals initially introduced at the source (see Question 5).
The asymptotic rate of population expansion, V, is the distance between locations with
equal population densities in successive years, and Skellam’s model can be used to
show that

(see Question 4). Likewise, the intrinsic rate of growth, r, can be estimated using data
of the growth of existing populations, and the dispersion coefﬁcient, D, can be esti-
mated using the formula
(4)
where A(t) is average distance organisms have traveled at time t.
Skellam’s model has been used to study the spread of a variety of organisms,
including oak trees, cereal leaf beetles, and cabbage butterﬂies. As an illustration of how
the model can be applied, we return to the population of Central European muskrats
introduced in the opening paragraph and Figure 1. Population studies indicate that r,
the intrinsic rate of muskrat population increase, was no greater than 1.1 per year, and
that D, the dispersion coefﬁcient, was no greater than 230 km2/year. Consequently, the

solution to Skellam’s model stated in Equation (2) predicts that the distribution of
muskrats, under the best circumstances for the species, is given by
(5)
where (x, y) is the point x km east and y km north from the release point near Prague
and t is the time in years (after 1905). Formula (3) predicts that the maximum rate
of population expansion is
which is a little greater than the observed rate of 25.4 km/yr.
The derivation of the diffusion equation may be found in many differential equa-
tions texts, or see Introduction to Mathematics for Life Scientists, 3rd ed., by Edward
Batschelet, Springer-Verlag, New York, pages 392–395. Skellam’s model and several
variations are discussed in Mathematical Models in Biology by Leah Edelstein-Keshet,
McGraw-Hill, Boston, 1988, pages 436–441. It is important to emphasize that Skellam’s
modiﬁed diffusion equation given in formula (1) has solutions other than formula (2).
In general, solving partial differential equations is very difﬁcult, and often the best that
can be done is to focus on ﬁnding solutions with certain speciﬁed forms. Such solutions
can then be used to analyze practical situations, as we did with the muskrat problem.

7. Use Skellam’s model to construct a function that estimates the population den-
sity of the small cabbage white butterﬂy if the largest diffusion coefﬁcient
observed is 129 km2/year and the largest intrinsic rate of increase observed is

does this compare with the largest observed rate of population expansion of
170 km/year?
8. In this question, you are asked to explore an alternative approach to analyzing
the muskrat problem using Skellam’s model. Recall that the intrinsic rate of
growth of the muskrat population was r  1.1 and that the maximum rate of dis-
persion was observed to be V  25.4.
a. Use these values for r and V in formula (3) to estimate the dispersion
coefﬁcient D.
b. By substituting r  1.1 into formula (2) along with the value for D you
obtained in part (a), ﬁnd the population density in 1925 for the muskrats at
the location 50 km north and 50 km west of the release point (source) near
Prague. Compare your answer with the answer to Question 6.
c. Use formula (4) to estimate the average distance A of the muskrat
population in 1925 from its source near Prague.

SECTION A.1
A Brief Review of Algebra
There are many techniques from elementary algebra that are needed in calculus. This
appendix contains a review of such topics, and we begin by examining numbering
systems.
An integer is a “whole number,” either positive or negative. For example, 1, 2,
875, 15, 83, and 0 are integers, while , 8.71, and 
are not.
A rational number is a number that can be expressed as the quotient 
of two
integers, where b  0. For example, 
and 
are rational numbers, as are
Every integer is a rational number since it can be expressed as itself divided by 1.
When expressed in decimal form, rational numbers are either terminating or inﬁnitely
repeating decimals. For example,
A number that cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers is called an
irrational number. For example,
are irrational numbers.
The rational numbers and irrational numbers form the real numbers and can be
visualized geometrically as points on a line, called the real number line. To con-
struct such a representation, choose a point on a line as the location of the number 0.
This is called the origin. Select a point to represent the number 1. This determines the
scale of the number line, and each number is located an appropriate distance (multi-
ple of 1) from the origin. If the line is horizontal, the positive numbers are located to
the right of the origin and the negative numbers to the left, as indicated in Figure A.1.
The coordinate of a particular point on the line is the number associated with it.
FIGURE A.1
The number line.
If a and b are real numbers and a is to the right of b on the number line, we say that
a is greater than b and write a . b. If a is to the left of b, we say that a is less
than b and write a , b (Figure A.2). For example,

A real number is said to satisfy a particular inequality involving a variable if the
inequality is satisﬁed when the number is substituted for the variable. The inequality
is said to be solved when all numbers that satisfy it have been found. The set of all
solutions is called the solution set of the inequality.

Thus the solution set is comprised of all real numbers between 
and 2, including
2 (but not 1).
A set of real numbers that can be represented on the number line by a line segment
is called an interval. Inequalities can be used to describe intervals. For example, the
interval a 	 x  b consists of all real numbers x that are between a and b, including
a but excluding b. This interval is shown in Figure A.3. The numbers a and b are
known as the endpoints of the interval. The square bracket at a indicates that a is
included in the interval, while the rounded bracket at b indicates that b is excluded.
Intervals may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite in extent and may or may not contain either
endpoint. The possibilities (including customary notation and terminology) are illus-
trated in Figure A.4.

The mth root of a negative number is not deﬁned when m is even. For example,

By convention, if m is even, a1/m is taken to be positive even when there is a
negative number whose mth power is a. For example, 24 and (2)4 both equal 16,

Sometimes it is necessary, or at least desirable, to write a fraction so that either the
numerator or denominator contains no roots. The algebraic procedure for achieving this
is called rationalizing. Here is an example in which a root is removed from the
denominator.
EXAMPLE A.1.10
Rationalize the denominator in the expression 
Solution
Multiply both the numerator and denominator of the given expression by 
The algebraic identity
can be used to rationalize fractions when the numerator or denominator contains a
factor of the form 
The key lies in noting that the root can be removed from
by multiplying by the complementary expression 
since
An expression of the form 
can be rationalized in a similar fashion by using
its complement 
This procedure is illustrated in Examples A.1.11 and A.1.12.
EXAMPLE A.1.11
Rationalize the numerator in the expression 
Solution
We multiply both the numerator and denominator by 
and obtain

Factoring Polynomials and Solving Systems 
of Equations
A polynomial is an expression of the form
a0  a1x  a2x2    anxn
where n is a nonnegative integer and 
are real numbers known as the
coefﬁcients of the polynomial. Polynomials appear in a variety of mathematical con-
texts, and the ﬁrst goal of this section is to examine some important algebraic prop-
erties of polynomials.
If 
n is said to be the degree of the polynomial. A nonzero constant is
said to be a polynomial of degree 0. (Technically, the number 0 is also a polyno-
mial, but it has no degree.) For example, 
is a polynomial of degree 5,
with terms 
and 12. Similar terms in two polynomials in the variable x are
terms with the same degree. Thus, in the ﬁfth-degree polynomial 
and
the third-degree polynomial 
, the terms 
and 
are simi-
lar terms. Polynomials are multiplied by constants and added and subtracted by com-
bining similar terms, as illustrated in Example A.2.1.

ECOLOGY
The atmosphere above each square
centimeter of Earth’s surface weighs 1 kilogram
(kg).
a. Assuming Earth is a sphere of radius
km, use the formula 
to
calculate the surface area of Earth and then
ﬁnd the total mass of the atmosphere.
b. Oxygen occupies approximately 22% of the
total mass of the atmosphere, and it is esti-
mated that plant life produces approximately
of oxygen per year. If none of
this oxygen were used up by plants or animals
(or combustion), how long would it take to
build up the total mass of oxygen in the
atmosphere (part a)?*

Solution
To ﬁnd the required product, we must multiply each term of 
by each
term of 
and then combine similar terms. We have
The computation can also be done “vertically”:
Many of the polynomials that arise in practice have integer coefﬁcients (or are closely
related to polynomials that do). Techniques for factoring polynomials with integer coefﬁ-
cients are illustrated in the following examples. In each, the goal is to rewrite the given
polynomial as a product of polynomials of lower degree that also have integer coefﬁcients.
EXAMPLE A.2.4
Factor the polynomial x2  2x  3 using integer coefﬁcients.
Solution
The goal is to write the polynomial as a product of the form
x2  2x  3  (x  a)(x  b)
where a and b are integers. The distributive law implies that
(x  a)(x  b)  x2  (a  b)x  ab
Hence, we must ﬁnd integers a and b such that
x2  2x  3  x2  (a  b)x  ab
or, equivalently, such that
a  b  2
and
ab  3
From the list
1, 3
and
1, 3
of pairs of integers whose product is 3, choose a  3 and b  1 as the only pair
whose sum is 2. It follows that
x2  2x  3  (x  3)(x  1)
which you should check by multiplying out the right-hand side.

The solutions of an equation are the values of the variable that make the equation
true. For example, x  2 is a solution of the equation
x3  6x2  12x  8  0
because substitution of 2 for x gives
23  6(22)  12(2)  8  8  24  24  8  0
In Examples A.2.10 and A.2.11, you will see how factoring can be used to solve
certain equations. The technique is based on the fact that if the product of two (or
more) terms is equal to zero, then at least one of the terms must be equal to zero. For
example, if ab  0, then either a  0 or b  0 (or both).
EXAMPLE A.2.10
Solve the equation x2  3x  10.
Solution
First subtract 10 from both sides to get
x2  3x  10  0
and then factor the resulting polynomial on the left-hand side to get
(x  5)(x  2)  0
Since the product (x  5)(x  2) can be zero only if one (or both) of its factors
is zero, it follows that the solutions are x  5 (which makes the ﬁrst factor zero) and
x  2 (which makes the second factor zero).
EXAMPLE A.2.11
Solve the equation 
Solution
Put the fractions on the left-hand side over the common denominator x2 and add to get
or
Now factor the polynomial in the numerator to get
A quotient is zero only if its numerator is zero and its denominator is not zero, so it
follows that x  1 and x  2 are the required solutions.

The Quadratic Formula
■
The solutions of the quadratic equation
ax2  bx  c  0
(for a  0)
are given by the formula
x  b  b2  4ac
2a
The term b2  4ac in the quadratic formula is called the discriminant of the
quadratic equation. If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two solutions, one
coming from the formula with the sign  replaced by  and the other with  replaced

by . If the discriminant is zero, the equation has only one solution since the 
formula reduces to 
. If the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real
solutions since negative numbers do not have real square roots.
The use of the quadratic formula is illustrated in Examples A.2.14 through A.2.16.
EXAMPLE A.2.14
Solve the equation x2  3x  1  0.
Solution
This is a quadratic equation with a  1, b  3, and c  1. Using the quadratic for-
mula, you get
EXAMPLE A.2.15
Solve the equation x2  18x  81  0.
Solution
This is a quadratic equation with a  1, b  18, and c  81. Using the quadratic for-
mula, you ﬁnd that the discriminant is zero and that the formula for x gives
EXAMPLE A.2.16
Solve the equation x2  x  1  0.
Solution
This is a quadratic equation with a  1, b  1, and c  1. Using the quadratic for-

Since there is no real square root of 3, it follows that the equation has no real solution.
A collection of equations that are to be solved simultaneously is called a system of
equations. Some of the calculus problems in Chapter 7 involve the solution of sys-
tems of two (or more) equations in two (or more) unknowns. For example, you may

The procedure for solving a system of two equations in two unknowns is to (tem-
porarily) eliminate one of the variables, thereby reducing the problem to a single equa-
tion in one variable, which you then solve for its variable. Once you have found the
value of one of the variables, you can substitute it into either of the original equa-
tions and solve to get the value of the other variable.
The most common techniques for the elimination of variables are illustrated in
Examples A.2.17 and A.2.18.
EXAMPLE A.2.17
Solve the system
Solution
To eliminate y, multiply both sides of the ﬁrst equation by 2 and both sides of the
second equation by 3 so that the system becomes
8x  6y  26
9x  6y  21
Then add the equations to get
x  0  5
or
x  5
To ﬁnd y, you can substitute x  5 into either of the original equations. If you
choose the second equation, you ﬁnd that
3(5)  2y  7
2y  22
or
y  11
That is, the solution of the system is x  5 and y  11.
To check this answer, substitute x  5 and y  11 into each of the original
equations. From the ﬁrst equation you get
4(5)  3(11)  20  33  13
and from the second equation you get
3(5)  2(11)  15  22  7
as required.

and substitute this into the ﬁrst equation to eliminate x. This gives
or
(y  3)(y  5)  0
from which it follows that
y  3
or
y  5
If y  3, the second equation gives
x  (3)  1
or
x  2
and if y  5, the second equation gives

x  6
Hence the system has two solutions,
x  6, y  5
and
x  2, y  3
To check these answers, substitute each pair x, y into the ﬁrst equation. If x  6
and y  5, you get

and if x  2 and y  3, you get

SECTION A.3
Evaluating Limits with L’Hôpital’s Rule
In curve sketching and other applications of calculus, it is often necessary to com-
pute a limit of the form
where c is either a ﬁnite number or 
then the quotient rule for 
limits may be used, but if both f(x) and g(x) approach 0 as x approaches c, practically
anything can happen. For example,
lim
x→ (1x3)  (1x2)
1x
    lim
x→0 2x3  3x2
x5  x4     and    lim
x→1 x  1
x3  1
. If lim
x→c g(x)  0,
lim
x→c f(x)
g(x)

and 
Forms
`
`

0

all have this property, but the limit on the left is 0, the one in the center is , and
the one on the right is .
Limits such as these are called 
indeterminate forms. Similarly, limits of quo-
tients in which both the numerator and denominator increase or decrease without
bound as 
are called 
indeterminate forms.
There is a powerful technique, known as L’Hôpital’s rule, which you can use to
analyze indeterminate forms. The rule says, in effect, that if your attempt to ﬁnd the 
limit of a quotient leads to either a 
or 
indeterminate form, then take derivatives
of the numerator and the denominator and try again. Here is a more symbolic state-
ment of the procedure.

If lim
x→c f(x)  0 and lim
x→c g(x)  0, then
The use of L’Hôpital’s rule is illustrated in Examples A.3.1 through A.3.4. As
you read through these examples, pay particular attention to the following two points:
1. L’Hôpital’s rule involves differentiating the numerator and the denominator
separately. A common mistake is to differentiate the entire quotient using the
quotient rule.
2. L’Hôpital’s rule applies only to quotients whose limits are indeterminate forms
. Limits of the form 
are not indeterminate (the ﬁrst is 0, and the
second is ).
EXAMPLE A.3.1
Use L’Hôpital’s rule to compute the limit
Solution
This is a 
indeterminate form, so L’Hôpital’s rule applies, and we get

EXAMPLE A.3.2
Use L’Hôpital’s rule to compute the limit
Solution
By substituting x  1 into the numerator and denominator, we see that this is a 
indeterminate form. We could evaluate this limit by the factor method developed
in Chapter 1, but notice how much easier it is to use L’Hôpital’s rule:
EXAMPLE A.3.3
Evaluate 
.
Solution
If you blindly apply L’Hôpital’s rule, you get
However, if you use your calculator to evaluate the given quotient at a number very
close to 2 (say, at 2.0001), you ﬁnd that the number you get is much larger than 
. Why? The answer you got with L’Hôpital’s rule was wrong because the given limit
is not indeterminate. In fact, by simply substituting x  2, you get

Find

Since this new limit is also of the form 
, we apply L’Hôpital’s rule again to get
and we conclude that
Although L’Hôpital’s rule only applies to 
and 
indeterminate forms, other 
kinds of indeterminate forms can often be computed by combining L’Hôpital’s rule
with a little algebra. This procedure is illustrated in Examples A.3.5 and A.3.6.
EXAMPLE A.3.5
Find 
Solution
This limit is of the indeterminate form 
and can be rewritten as
or as

The Summation Notation
Sums of the form 
appear so often in mathematics that a special
notation has been developed to handle them. To describe such a sum, it sufﬁces to
characterize the general term 
and to indicate that n terms of this form are to be
added, starting with the term where 
and ending with the term where 
It
is customary to use the Greek uppercase letter  (sigma) to denote summation and
to express the sum compactly as follows.

THINK ABOUT IT
PROBLEM
For comfortable modern living, it is estimated that each person needs roughly 60 m2
for housing, 40 m2 for his or her job, 50 m2 for public buildings and recreation facil-
ities, 90 m2 for transportation (e.g., highways), and 4,000 m2 for the production of
food.
Questions
1.
Switzerland has approximately 11,000 km2 of livable space (arable and habit-
able land). How many people can comfortably live in Switzerland? Look up the
actual population of Switzerland. Based on the ﬁgures given here, is Switzerland
overcrowded or is there still room for comfortable growth?
2.
Use an almanac, an encyclopedia, or some other source to obtain the population
of India. How much livable space would there have to be in India to accom-
modate its current population without overcrowding? Now look up the total area
of India. Even if all of India is comprised of livable space, is there enough room
for the population to live comfortably?
3.
You probably knew that India is overcrowded. Pick another country where the
answer is not so obvious (Bolivia? Zimbabwe? San Marino?). Describe the
“comfort of living” in that country.

The line y  x has slope 1, so it is perpendicular to
the line through A(a, b) and B(b, a), which has slope
. If O is the origin and M is the
point where y  x intersects the line segment AB,
then right triangles OMA and OMB are similar since
they share side OM and
It follows that AM    BM , which means that A
and B are reﬂections of one another in y  x.
