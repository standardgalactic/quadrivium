I don’t have my umbrella
I’ll get wet
I’m lucky.

Connectives join propositions to make new propositions

If it’s raining and I don’t have my umbrella,
then I’ll get wet unless I’m lucky.
Connectives join propositions to make new propositions,
whatever those propositions are about, without adding to the topic.

Conjunctions
Consider these two propositions:
It’s raining.
I don’t have my umbrella.

Conjunctions
Consider these two propositions:
It’s raining.
I don’t have my umbrella.
We can assert both of them in one go by asserting their conjunction:
It’s raining and I don’t have my umbrella.

Conjunctions
Consider these two propositions:
It’s raining.
I don’t have my umbrella.
We can assert both of them in one go by asserting their conjunction:
It’s raining and I don’t have my umbrella.
For propositions p and q, their conjunction is the proposition p & q.

Conjunctions
Consider these two propositions:
It’s raining.
I don’t have my umbrella.
We can assert both of them in one go by asserting their conjunction:
It’s raining and I don’t have my umbrella.
For propositions p and q, their conjunction is the proposition p & q.
p, q are the conjuncts of the conjunction p & q.

Example Conjunctions

Disjunction
We can assert that at least one of the two propositions are true by
asserting their disjunction.
I’ll get wet, or I’m lucky.

Disjunction
We can assert that at least one of the two propositions are true by
asserting their disjunction.
I’ll get wet, or I’m lucky.
Disjunctions can be interpreted as inclusive:
I’ll get wet, or I’m lucky (and maybe both).

Disjunction
We can assert that at least one of the two propositions are true by
asserting their disjunction.
I’ll get wet, or I’m lucky.
Disjunctions can be interpreted as inclusive:
I’ll get wet, or I’m lucky (and maybe both).
or exclusive:
I’ll get wet, or I’m lucky (and not both).

Inclusive Disjunction
We will focus on inclusive disjunction as it is easier to work with in
many ways; in particular, it has a dual relationship with
conjunction.

Inclusive Disjunction
We will focus on inclusive disjunction as it is easier to work with in
many ways; in particular, it has a dual relationship with
conjunction.
The inclusive disjunction of p and q, is p ∨q.
p and q are called the disjuncts of the disjunction.

Inclusive Disjunction
We will focus on inclusive disjunction as it is easier to work with in
many ways; in particular, it has a dual relationship with
conjunction.
The inclusive disjunction of p and q, is p ∨q.
p and q are called the disjuncts of the disjunction.
(The symbol “∨” is for “vel,” which is Latin for “or.”)

“Unless” is a Disjunction
“Unless” acts like a disjunction too.
I’ll get wet, unless I’m lucky.

“Unless” is a Disjunction
“Unless” acts like a disjunction too.
I’ll get wet, unless I’m lucky.
I’ll go to the party unless Clancy is there.
(Should “unless” be treated as inclusive or exclusive?)

Conditionals
We can express relations between propositions by way of
conditionals, for example:
If it rains then I’ll get wet.

Conditionals
We can express relations between propositions by way of
conditionals, for example:
If it rains then I’ll get wet.
Conditionals take diﬀerent forms:
If p then q

conditionals, for example:

Conditionals take diﬀerent forms:
If p then q
If p, q

Conditionals
We can express relations between propositions by way of
conditionals, for example:
If it rains then I’ll get wet.
Conditionals take diﬀerent forms:
If p then q
If p, q
q if p

p implies q

Conditionals
We can express relations between propositions by way of
conditionals, for example:
If it rains then I’ll get wet.
Conditionals take diﬀerent forms:
If p then q
If p, q
q if p
p only if q
p implies q
We say p is the antecedent, and q is the consequent of p ⊃q.

identify the antecedent and the consequent.

antecedent, and “you study hard” as the consequent?
▶You’ll do well if you study hard.
▶You’ll do well only if you study hard.

Biconditionals
You can express a two way connection between propositions by way
of their biconditional:

Biconditionals
You can express a two way connection between propositions by way
of their biconditional:
I’ll get wet if and only if it’s raining.

Biconditionals
You can express a two way connection between propositions by way
of their biconditional:
I’ll get wet if and only if it’s raining.
The biconditional of p and q is p ≡q.
p and q are the left- and right-hand expressions of the biconditional.
The words “if and only if” are often abbreviated “iﬀ.”

Negation
The basic way of denying a proposition is to assert its negation:
Smoking is not always bad for your health.

Negation
The basic way of denying a proposition is to assert its negation:
Smoking is not always bad for your health.
If p is a proposition, its negation is ∼p.
p is said to be the negand of ∼p.

their negands?

these and more are also studied by logicians.
