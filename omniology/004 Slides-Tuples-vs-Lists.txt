Tuples vs. Lists
●
Tuples are faster and more efficient than lists. Python uses a process called constant 
folding. This means recognizing and evaluating constant expressions at compile time 
rather than computing them at run time;
One important remark is that tuples are really efficient when they contain immutable 
objects like numbers, strings or other tuples.

Tuples are safer that lists. This is called data integrity.
 
 
●
Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries. Lists are not valid as keys.
