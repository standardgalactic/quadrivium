Dedication
Robert Collins: I dedicate this book to my lovely wife, Sarah. Over many,
many years, she has provided me with unwavering support that has enabled
me to produce, among other things, the most contemporary work on doing
business in China. Sarah, you are the greatest gift that life has given me.
As young newlyweds, we moved to a far-off place called Beijing, China, in
1983. We were truly pioneers. Together, we witnessed the beginning of
China’s powerful transformation into the modern world.
This book is for my children, too. Thanks to your tremendous commitment to
the Mandarin Chinese language, you’re well positioned to participate in what
China has to offer. My delightful daughter is a treasure in more ways than I
can express. G.R., you’re an incredibly talented young man with all the mak-
ings of great success. And Z-man, born in modern China, you just simply rock!
And last but not least, I dedicate this book to my parents, Mike and Evelyn,
who consistently encouraged me to pursue my passion.
Carson Block: I dedicate Doing Business in China For Dummies to my father,
Bill. When I was a teenager and college student, he gave me the opportunities
to travel to Asia and to study Chinese (including in Beijing). When I gradu-
ated from college, he provided the backing that allowed me to go to Shanghai
and try my hand at business there. Without his support for my China endeav-
ors, neither this book nor my China career would have been possible.

Introduction
F
or many Westerners, something about China is so intense and exciting
that it’s a social glue among those who’ve spent some time there. We met
through a mutual acquaintance who knew we had backgrounds in China. Over
lunch, we swapped stories (and laughs) about living and doing business in
China — how challenging the market is, how strong a role government plays in
business there, how overwhelming the country can feel, and how everything
seems to take so much longer to get done. We both admitted that a solid how-
to guide could’ve saved us a good deal of time hard spent climbing the learn-
ing curve. And so Doing Business in China For Dummies was born.
We think (and hope) that you can find this book useful as a starting point and
reference in your China business adventure. As you find out when reading the
book, little about doing business there is easy. Your company needs to figure
out how the Chinese business system works and how to develop and manage
Chinese relationships — and your company needs to be willing to make a
commitment to the market for the long haul. You need a lot of patience along
the way, too. But with this book as your guide, your company (and you per-
sonally) can benefit from the opportunities that China offers.
About This Book
Doing Business in China For Dummies tells you what you need to know to suc-
ceed in China. How does business really work there? How do you get started?
What do you need to do to get your business up and running properly?
You decide where to start and what to read. This book is a reference tool for
you and your business when and where you need it. It’s designed so you can
read and understand chapters of interest without having to read the rest of
the book. (Of course, you’ll be better prepared if you do read the whole thing,
even if you don’t do so in order.) Just use the table of contents or index to
find the topics you want.

This book is organized for easy reference. It’s divided into five parts, each
with multiple chapters. Within each chapter are various sections that discuss
some aspect of doing business in China, such as
 The types of approvals you need to get started
 Deciding where to set up shop
 Auditing factories
 Advertising
 Enjoying a Chinese business banquet
After you read this book, you won’t be ready to do business on your own in
China; you will, however, have a much better sense of where you need help —
through attorneys, translators and consultants, and the like. You’ll also have
learned from mistakes other foreign businesspeople have made in the Middle
Kingdom. In that way, you’ll start out better prepared than a lot of business-
people who’ve ultimately been successful.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use the following conventions throughout the text to make things consis-
tent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by easy-to-
understand definitions. Italics may also indicate emphasis.
 Bold highlights the action parts of numbered steps and key words in
bulleted lists.
 Chinese words are written according to the official pinyin system of
Romanization, usually followed by phonetic spellings.
 The word domestic refers to China; foreign refers to anywhere outside of
China.
 The Chinese government controls exchange rates of the Chinese 
renminbi (RMB), or yuan; because the government has been gradually
appreciating the RMB, we don’t convert it to U.S. dollars. You can find
the current exchange rate at finance.yahoo.com/currency. We do,
however, offer equivalents of Hong Kong dollars.

What You’re Not to Read
We’ve written this book so you can find the information you want when you
want it. We think you’re probably too busy running your business to want to
read every word from start to finish. We’ve identified some information in
this book as skippable material. You may find this information of interest if
you have spare time on your hands, but you won’t sink a business deal just
because you skipped over it! So we won’t be offended if you don’t want to
look at information such as
 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are the shaded boxes that appear here
and there. They share mini business case studies and observations 
on China. Some of them are funny or outrageous. They can be useful
illustrations of points that we’ve made in the text.
 Anything with a Technical Stuff icon attached: This information is
interesting but isn’t required reading to get an understanding of 
business in China.
 The stuff on the copyright page: Maybe you want to save this info for
some late night bedtime reading while you’re trying to overcome the jet
lag from your trip to China! (Otherwise, if you’re thinking of knocking off
this book, rest assured that it’s protected by copyright.)
Foolish Assumptions
We wrote this guidebook on China with some thoughts about businesspeople
like you. Here’s what we assume about you, our valued reader:
 You’re a business professional with some know-how about running a
company. You may have some knowledge about international markets.
 You’re looking for solid advice on how to understand the Chinese busi-
ness system and the Chinese culture, too. You want a book that explains
China business in a way that can add immediate value to your company
and can be put to good use today.
 You’ve heard the hype and want to understand if and how your business
can benefit by being in China. Or you have a great idea for a business
and want to figure out whether it’ll work in China. You want to know
what opportunities in China make the most sense.
 You’re part of a small- to medium-sized manufacturer looking for sourc-
ing or a small company looking to sell your product or service in China.
You want to do business within China or from abroad.
 Much of what you know about China comes from reading Western news
sources.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
Doing Business in China For Dummies is divided into five parts, and the parts
are divided into chapters. In the following sections, we give you a brief look
at what you can expect from each part so you can get started right away with
the area that interests you most about doing business in China.
Part I: Building Your Foundation
The best way to get up to speed on China is to understand the possibilities of
expanding your business to China. Starting in Chapter 1, we help you deter-
mine whether your company is a good fit for China and suggest the first steps
to take. In this part, you get a rundown of China business basics, including its
challenges and opportunities. Along the way, we show you how you can
ensure that your business plan is strong and executable. We help you deter-
mine what to include and what to prepare for.
Part II: Starting Up in China
Figuring out how business works in China calls for a novel take on business
as you know it. We give you the lay of the land when it comes to setting up
shop. You also get a feel for the different regions where you may consider 
setting up. We introduce you to key geographic areas that you may want to
concentrate on.
From there we talk you through the Chinese government — a key player for
any business in China. Building your business in China wouldn’t be complete
without finding the right people to work in the business, so we give you
advice on hiring a local team. And then we show you the keys to unlocking
the mystery of finance in China.
Part III: Conducting Daily Business
After you’re committed to doing business in China, you’re ready to go on
location. Don’t be intimidated by the vast land mass that makes up the
Middle Kingdom, though. We first help you understand the Chinese way of
doing things. Their traditions are deep, but you can find ways to make them
work for you. We help you literally find your way: From flights to taxis, con-
verting money to finding health care, consider this chapter your basic day-to-
day personal guide. Getting down to business, we tell you all about sourcing,
selling, and manufacturing. And we also explain how to negotiate with your
hard-nosed Chinese counterparts across the table.

Part IV: Building Successful 
Business Relationships
As you figure out in this part, relationships are important to business in
China. We guide you to better understand the importance of guan xi (connec-
tions/relationships) to help you develop and cultivate your most important
business relationships. You discover how to successfully navigate the lavish,
long-winded Chinese business banquet with grace. We also give you what you
need to know to make you look smart rather than foolish. And lastly, we get
your business prepared for whatever comes your way in China.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens gives you and your business a bunch of good pointers such
as good contract provisions and tips on how to make a profit in China. To
take your mind off your work, we share our hand-picked list of ways to enjoy
your downtime (in the event you have any!) in China. China’s an exciting
country worth exploring, and we want you to do just that.

In this part . . .
H
ere, we give you a clear understanding of opportuni-
ties in China and help you determine how ready
your company is to do business there. And we discuss
why you should consider doing business there in the first
place. To get you started on the right foot, we point out
some cultural differences you need to know about.
This part also looks at where China as a country is today
and how it got there. We give you some helpful back-
ground on the Chinese Communist Party and point out
how China’s modernization plan is changing the way
people do business there. Finally, we look at how you can
develop a solid business plan for your company in China.

in China
In This Chapter
 Understanding the opportunities
 Recognizing that you’re on a journey like no other
 Seeing whether your company is good for what China has to offer
 Finding the correct path for your future
 Taking the next steps
C
hina certainly has plenty of prospects for foreign companies. The flip
side is that it can be a tough place to do business. Your company’s China
team will be challenged to deliver results on time and within expectations.
Even some of the world’s biggest and best companies have stumbled hard in
China. Before you consider investing in China, your company needs to figure
out whether the opportunities are a good fit.
Finding the right path for your company is key. You need to understand how
the market really works and what role the government plays in your busi-
ness. Be prepared to change course from time to time in response to this fast-
changing market. You may face some of the most brutal negotiations you’ve
ever seen. You have to play by their rules on their home turf, doing business
the Chinese way.
Consider this chapter your personal guide on your business trek to China.
Your guides have successfully been down this path many times. The journey
will probably be long and exhausting, but it’ll likely be very rewarding in the
end. Let the journey begin!

Understanding China’s Appeal
The dragon called China has emerged on the world scene as a new economic
powerhouse. Since China opened its doors to foreign business in the late
1970s, its transformation has been absolutely remarkable. Over the last 25
years, China has transformed itself from a centrally planned socialist state to
a semi-market-driven, semi-command economy. For more than a decade,
China’s GDP has grown over 9 percent each year.
China recently attracted over US$70 billion worth of foreign investments in 
a single year, more than any other country by far! Since China opened her
door to overseas companies, approximately US$700 billion in foreign direct
investment (FDI) has landed in China. China now ranks as the fourth-largest
economy on the planet after the U.S., Japan, and Germany. Soon, it’ll be the
second-largest economy in the world. Many economists are saying that China
will be the world’s largest economy by 2025.
If the booming economy isn’t enough, this section can help you understand
China’s appeal. (For more on potential opportunities for you business, see
Chapter 2.)
Cutting costs to meet global demands
Manufacturers based in China have considerable cost advantages over com-
panies producing goods in Europe or North America. Foreign investors in
China continue to chase cheaper wages and lower operating costs, which
translate into improved margins and greater profits. (However, as we explain
in Chapter 13, most companies don’t lower their per-unit labor costs by
moving manufacturing to China. Instead, the improved margins usually come
from lower utility costs, one-stop shopping for suppliers, and using more flex-
ible manufacturing models that don’t usually work in the West.)
Strong global demand from consumers for low-priced Chinese-made products
is driving much of the foreign investment. You’ve no doubt heard about the
large multinational companies that have poured billions of dollars in invest-
ment in China to produce goods for export to the West. For foreign compa-
nies operating there, Made in China can mean making customers in Europe
and North America happy by keeping prices as low as possible.

Part I: Building Your Foundation 

Accessing a fast-growing local market
Foreign companies aren’t going to China just to lower their production 
costs (see preceding section); they’re also looking at getting a piece of the
fast-growing domestic market. China’s sheer size and growth prospects are a
big draw for foreign companies. With the creation of more highly skilled jobs,
China’s incomes are rising. And rising incomes translate into greater purchas-
ing power for the Chinese in urban centers.
11
Chapter 1: So You Want to Do Business in China
Looking past the veneer
China’s economic miracle can almost take your
breath away. As you stroll through a major city,
you see signs of progress almost everywhere
you look. China’s urban centers are teeming
with people and activity. Shiny new offices and
residential towers are popping up all over.
Construction cranes dot the horizon as far as
the eye can see. Newly built automobiles are
clogging up the city’s arteries. Consumer prod-
uct brands from around the world are all the
rage.
Your day is filled up with wall-to-wall meetings
with the Chinese. The opportunities seem to
hold much promise for your company in China.
At the end of a long day as the sun starts setting
in Shanghai, you find your lower jaw suddenly
begins to drop. You see the city’s new skyline
unfold in front of you as the sun falls behind the
hundreds of gleaming new skyscrapers. You
think to yourself, “This is a land of opportunity.”
In China’s major cities, you’ll no doubt be
impressed by the posh five-star hotels, high-
speed bullet trains, gleaming new airports, and
modern business districts that have risen out of
swamps. Some foreigners can easily get a little
too carried away with China. But you come to
understand that the country has a certain
veneer to it. China wants you to believe that
everything is A-okay.
As you begin your journey, you realize that
China is full of promise. But China is full of chal-
lenges, too. Many Western businesspeople
tend to underestimate the challenges they’ll
face. They don’t see the trap door ahead of
them before they fall through it.
We’ve heard many horror stories of doing 
business in China — the Chinese scam artists;
companies posing as legitimate businesses;
manufacturers producing products from stolen
intellectual property; and employee theft and
embezzlement. The list goes on and on. China
can be a very good market for your business. At
the same time, be aware that it can be a very
bad place for your business. So keep your busi-
ness on high alert at all times while working in
China.

Considering Ways to Get In on the Action
Many people ask themselves, “What’s the best opportunity for my company
in China?” Business executives and managers may not be clear about what
the opportunities are, never mind how to develop them. You should sit down
and search in depth to understand the possibilities for your business.
Despite certain challenges, China is a good place for many companies.
Foreign companies have the opportunity to sell into China, manufacture in
China, or source products or parts from there. This section can help guide
you to make better decisions about your company’s opportunities in China.
We begin by looking at several of the most common possibilities.
Selling into China
Exporting your products to China is one way to enter the market, and it may
be less risky for your company, too. China has an estimated 200 million
middle-class consumers, and it’s adding millions of new consumers who are
buying all sorts of consumer products and financial services. A fast-growing
middle class, mostly in or near the coastal cities of China, is paving the way
for strong selling opportunities. Retailers, financial services companies, and
consumer product companies are jumping into the market to aggressively
expand their business.
Retailing in China is taking off like a rocket. Soon, sales are expected to reach
US$1 trillion. China has more than 20 million retail outlets now. New hyper-
markets, supermarkets, department stores, and electronics, appliance, and
home décor shops are popping up everywhere in eastern China (see Chap-
ter 14 for details on retail markets).
With the explosion in retailing, the China market is witnessing more con-
sumer products and brands (prestigious foreign brands are particularly pop-
ular). New types of consumers are emerging with different needs and wants.
The markets are becoming more segmented as consumer buying behavior
differs from place to place.
Financial services firms are also starting to enjoy some good times. Foreign
banking institutions are expanding their capabilities and services. Foreign
insurance companies are starting to gain local market share by providing
much-needed protection for Chinese consumers. And because the Chinese
savings rate is a whopping 50 percent, financial services companies in partic-
ular are salivating at the opportunity to tap into Chinese household savings!
12
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

Selling to businesses in China is another huge opportunity. Just about every
Fortune Global 1000 firm is now doing business there. Thousands of small-
and medium-sized foreign companies are present, too. Opportunities for
sales of business services to foreign companies operating there include 
management consulting, human resources, accounting, legal services, real
estate, and so on.
Manufacturing and sourcing
Foreign investors have made China the world’s factory. With a good supply of
labor (and other lower costs) and high-quality production capabilities, China
continues to attract foreign manufacturers. Because China is highly competi-
tive on making products at a lower cost, many foreign companies look to
source parts and components there. Some large foreign multinationals are
moving their global procurement centers to China. As China moves up the
food chain into higher-value products, more companies are procuring higher-
quality products and components from China. Chapter 13 can tell you more
about manufacturing.
In the meantime, China has made massive investments in the country’s infra-
structure. New airports, highways, bridges, tunnels, trains, and ports have
sprung up across eastern China. This brand-new infrastructure has the 
potential to allow transportation companies to develop more sophisticated
support services for logistics and express carriers, air cargo, and sea freight.
Third-party logistics services in China are seeing explosive growth in sup-
porting manufacturing-driven export services. (However, logistics and 
distribution are still highly fragmented and inefficient, as we discuss in
Chapter 14.)
The sourcing capabilities aren’t just for the benefit of large multinational
companies. Small- and medium-sized companies are jumping on the band-
wagon, too. They can now get access to high-quality products and compo-
nents to stay internationally competitive. They can also avoid middlemen or
buyer’s agents to keep their prices even lower. Many small- and medium-sized
companies are trying to secure their future by lowering costs while maintain-
ing high quality standards. See Chapter 12 for details on sourcing.
13
Chapter 1: So You Want to Do Business in China

Deciding Whether China Is a Good Fit 
for Your Business
Many traditional manufacturers face rising business costs. Spiraling wages,
higher energy costs, and other cost-drivers have taken their toll. Manufacturers
have seen others go under before them. As they look for ways to become more
competitive, their eyes turn toward China.
Some companies are better suited than others for doing business in China.
This section can help you and your company understand some of the impor-
tant characteristics of a business that’s likely to succeed in China. By taking
stock of your company, you can evaluate your company’s readiness for
China.
Your company shouldn’t go to China because everyone else seems to be
going there. And going to China as the last resort — because your business is
already on its knees — isn’t a smart move either. Consider doing business in
China for one reason: because it makes good business sense.
Considering your employees
Many companies take pride in the fact that they’ve been a local manufacturer
in their home community. Some companies have been in business for several
generations. These companies have created jobs for local people, and the
company leaders are part of the fabric in the community where they live.
Unfortunately, many of these companies are under extreme pressure to
improve margins, lower costs, or boost productivity.
For companies like these and other less-established firms, going to China
may be an option to seriously consider. But no company leader really likes to
outsource jobs overseas. Restructuring your company while laying off loyal
company employees is no picnic, either. And other political, ethical, or finan-
cial concerns about China may weigh on businesspeople like yourself.
Consider all your options — both in and out of China. As you begin to get a
grip on the trade-offs for your business, you’ll be in a better position to
understand some of the likely consequences as well — and be prepared to
explain your decision. Laid-off workers may find some consolation that they
aren’t losing their jobs simply because somebody else is willing to do their
job for a much lower wage. Maybe doing business in China is a survival issue.
Perhaps you need a growth engine for new sales. Whatever the reason, make
sure you know why China may be your best bet.
14
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

Having international experience
Ideally, your company has some proven skills in successfully developing
international business opportunities. This experience can be importing or
exporting products to selected overseas markets. It may be managing over-
seas distributors of your products in Europe. It can be sourcing components
from a supplier in Malaysia. Maybe you already manage a production facility
in Mexico.
International business skills aren’t necessary for doing business in China, but
they’re highly desirable. You have to be a very fast learner if you’re new to
the international business game and plan to make your mark starting with
China. A company with no international experience can do well, but it needs
to be extra prepared for what lies ahead. For more information on business
planning, go to Chapter 4.
Getting company leaders on board
Some companies know that China is an option for their business, but the
owners don’t have the time, energy, or inclination to figure out how to make
China work for the company. They don’t know where to start. They don’t
have a roadmap to help them find their way. It seems all too foreign for the
owners. And it seems way too hard. If your company leadership has this type
of attitude, don’t attempt to do business in China.
You need to have strong leadership that’s committed to making your China
business a success in the long-term. Without your company leadership’s full
commitment, the chances of failure increase drastically.
Having patient capital
Your China business will likely require a significant amount of financial
resources to get started and to keep your business up and running. Most
companies find that making a profit in China takes longer than it does in the
West. Generally, you can expect getting profitable to take twice as long. In
part, this delay is due to China’s competitive business landscape. Getting to
critical mass takes time, too. If your financials aren’t at full strength, stay
away from China — your company doesn’t need to take on any more risks.
15
Chapter 1: So You Want to Do Business in China

Dealing with the government and laws
To set up in China, your company should be comfortable working with gov-
ernment workers and officials. You’ll face a lot of red tape with many permits
and approvals required, too. And China’s government bureaucracy has a well-
deserved reputation for moving at a snail’s pace. On top of it all, the govern-
ment official you deal with today may be gone tomorrow. If your company
isn’t prepared for dealing with government bureaucracy, China likely isn’t the
place for you to do business.
China’s business laws are quite different from what you’re used to. Make sure
you do your research and can get some good legal advice. Here’s what you
have to be ready for:
 Your company needs to have its various business activities preapproved
and then stay within them (unless you want to get more approvals).
 The currency, the renminbi (RMB), has a lot of exchange restrictions, so
you want to structure business in a way that optimizes your ability to
repatriate money. (See Chapter 10 for details on money.)
 You’re not allowed to own land in China — you may only own rights to
use the land for a period of time. And the types of rights vary, so you
have to be careful about which ones you’re receiving.
 China has different systems for taxation, labor regulation, and resolving
disputes (among other things).
 Many of China’s laws are somewhat business-friendly. Getting to under-
stand how they affect your company is imperative.
One area where China’s laws are very weak is intellectual property rights
(IPR) protection. Don’t sell or manufacture in China if you need to rely on
intellectual property laws alone to protect technology or processes. Go
somewhere where you’ll have more protection. See Chapter 17 for ways to
protect your company’s IPR.
Appreciating cultural differences
Different cultures do business in different ways. If your company has trouble
adapting to new ways of doing things or respecting a culture that’s different
from your own, your company is probably not well suited for doing business
in China.
16
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

On the other hand, your company’s culture can also be its biggest draw in 
the labor marketplace — the Chinese are often hungry to work for foreign
companies that offer more flexible and creative cultures than Chinese 
companies do.
Tracing the Path to Success
China is certainly not for the fainthearted. Many businesses over the years
have tried and failed. Some foreign investors have failed more than once! The
good news is that we know of many success stories in China, too. You can
find the path to success — you just need to know where to look for it.
What this book can deliver is a great deal of hands-on experience and know-
how about doing business in China. You need nerves of steel, the patience of
a saint, and the cunning of a fox. But your company can win in China. We’re
here to guide you down the right path.
Getting the right knowledge 
of China under your belt
Before you get started in any new market, you need to get the lay of the land.
Finding your way through the maze takes time. China’s certainly like no
market that you’ve ever done business in before.
The best way to look at the situation is to consider yourself a really big
sponge. Soak up as much as you can find out about the China marketplace.
Squeeze as much information out of good sources as possible. With the
knowledge of what the business environment is like, how the government
gets involved in business, and some of the market challenges you’ll likely
face, you’ll be much better prepared for the journey ahead.
Don’t believe just anyone who says he or she is an expert on China. The
China market is way too complicated for anybody to be a true expert on busi-
ness. (And because the market moves so fast, becoming out of date very
quickly is easy.) We’re here to serve as your guides, not your gurus.

plan for the market, check out Chapters 2, 3, and 4.

Chapter 1: So You Want to Do Business in China

Starting your engine
Visit China a few times before you start making any decisions. The best infor-
mation and advice in China comes from people who’ve done what you’re
trying to do — especially if they’re only a little further along than you are. Put
your feet on the ground just to do some networking. Take people out to lunch
and pick their brains. Then start thinking about making some decisions. The
more slowly you go and the more patient you are, the more information you’ll
collect and the better your chances of success. See the following section
titled “Taking the first steps: What you can do today.”
After you’ve broadened your knowledge of China, you’re ready to get your
business started. Some companies plunge right in with a real physical pres-
ence in China; others do business from a distance. Still others go halfway by
setting up in Hong Kong. You have to figure out the right approach for your
situation.
For newcomers to China, organizing a new company can be a real challenge.
You’ll soon be asking yourself what kind of company structure you need for
your company’s business in China. You have other considerations, too, such
as geography.
And getting the right people in China can be a difficult task. You may
encounter a shortage of talented managers with the right mix of skills and
abilities. All this startup activity comes at a cost, too. If your company needs
to be physically present in China, see Part II.
Getting down to business the Chinese way
When you first start doing business in China, you may think you’ve landed on
another planet! But armed with an understanding of how business really
works over there, you’ll find it’s not as hard as it seems. For information on
the how the Chinese go about business, go to Chapter 11.
The hard part comes when your company starts to negotiate with the
Chinese. They’re tough as nails when bargaining, and they have a reputation
for being some of the hardest-hitting negotiators around. Cunning is probably
the best way to explain their style, which is very well developed but can
seem outrageous and unprofessional to foreigners. To find out what you can
expect when you sit across the negotiating table from the Chinese, go to
Chapter 6.
18
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

Organizing your team for China
Putting a good team together in China is a balancing act. Many successful
investors do well in part because they make sure their top one or two China
managers are long-time company employees from home markets. If you’re
going to succeed in China, you have to ensure that your company’s culture in
China is foreign yet respectful of Chinese culture.
One must for attracting and retaining talent in China is to make sure you have
a clear idea of how you can help your Chinese employees develop their skills
and careers. You may find that Chinese employees are hungrier to learn than
any other employees you’ve had. If you don’t feed that desire — even for
unskilled laborers — you’re going to have problems with retention. To find
out more about organizing your team, go to Chapter 9.
Remaining flexible while 
staying the course
Advising you to keep your eye on the ball with China would be wrong — you
have to keep your eyes on a number of balls at the same time. Don’t fixate on
any one thing (such as minimizing taxes) while ignoring others. Don’t marry
yourself to any one strategy or plan, either.
You’re learning, and you’ll make mistakes. Don’t be afraid to recognize and
correct mistakes. Your operating environment can change at the drop of a
hat, too. Be ready to make large and fast changes to keep up. Even though
you likely have to change quickly and often, stay committed to China. Don’t
expect overnight success — you’ll get there eventually.
Respecting the country for what it is
China can look modern at first glance — glass skyscrapers, Chinese with
Western MBAs toasting fine wine at Jean Georges restaurant, and glitzy neon
displays in downtown shopping districts. This setting may be interesting, but
it’s not China.
China was isolated from the Western world for the better part of three
decades. It’s an old society with an old culture. Although it’s changing, the
vast majority of China hasn’t been transformed yet. Don’t ground your expec-
tations on your experiences in the West. Some things are easier in China, but
many aren’t.
19
Chapter 1: So You Want to Do Business in China

You should give the Chinese some credit where it’s due — dragging millions
out of poverty and overhauling a plodding centrally-planned economy.
Chinese society today faces many strains and has plenty of growing pains.
Don’t hold this against the Chinese — they’re doing a pretty good job when
you look at the challenges they face.
Staying on the lighter side
Keep your sense of humor about you. If you can’t laugh at yourself when
you’re doing business in China, you’re going to go crazy! Doing business in
China may be the most challenging thing you’ll do in your business career —
humor helps to keep things in perspective.
Taking the First Steps: What 
You Can Do Today
Ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said, “A journey of a thousand
miles begins with a single step.” That’s good advice for someone exploring
the China market for the first time. This section can give you some valuable
ideas on how you can get started now.
The right next steps to get you and your company headed in the correct
direction aren’t that difficult. Here are three simple steps to assist you in 
getting started on your journey:
1. Read.
A lot of information on China is in the media and online. You can find
some good info from government and official agencies, such as your
country’s commercial or trade service and the chamber of commerce.
Some countries offer specific China-related resources for businesses
thinking about doing business in China. Check out what specific China
information and services your home country government may provide.
Some of what you read may be of limited value. China is so big and
diverse that generalizing about it is almost impossible. Moreover, some
writers step off the plane, see modern buildings and new cars, and write
about China as though it’s as developed as Luxembourg. A lot of sources
don’t give you a realistic picture. Be wary of any literature that seems
overly positive or overly negative on China.
20
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

2. Go there.
Take business trips to different parts of China. Consider visits to both
large- and medium-sized cities to get a flavor for each. Go to a city in the
north and the south. And perhaps visit a city somewhere in between,
maybe a place outside of Shanghai.
Attend business networking functions while you’re there. Go to some
trade shows. Visit factories if you can. Look around, smell the smells,
and observe keenly. Most of all, don’t be too wide-eyed — try to scratch
the surface and find out what’s underneath.
3. Reach out.
The best people to meet are people who’re doing something similar to
what you want to do. Sometimes, the most informative contacts are only
a few months ahead of you on the road. Arrange beforehand to see
people you think may be helpful. Follow up with contacts you make
while networking — even if they don’t seem to know much more info
that can help you (you never know who they know or may meet). By
talking with others who have experience, you can start to piece together
your plan. Be careful to get a diversity of viewpoints, though — don’t
overly rely on a few people for advice.
If we can leave you with just a couple of themes for the rest of this book and
successfully doing business in China, they’re patience, flexibility, and persis-
tence. The more time you take to plan, or find a business site or partner, the
better your chances of success. The better you are at quickly adapting to
changes in the operating and regulatory environments, the more likely your
success will last.

M
any large multinational companies have been in China for years, but
even if you’re part of a small or startup business, you can still find
plenty of opportunities. This chapter gives you some food for thought about
how to do business in or with China, gives you a big-picture view of the busi-
ness environment, and outlines some of the challenges you’re likely to face.
Considering Why and How You 
Want to Do Business in China
Before making the jump into China, consider your goals. Some people want to
use China to improve their existing model or to sell into a growing Chinese
market. Others think about China because their competitors are already
there. Whatever your reason for considering China, think carefully about
your objectives and keep them in mind throughout the course of planning
and executing your business. The following sections explain the basics about
how you can use China’s enormous population to achieve those goals.
Manufacturing in the World’s Workshop
China is often referred to as the World’s Workshop because of the many
goods it produces for export. Since the 1990s, China has taken over manufac-
turing from many higher-cost countries and regions, such as the United

States, Japan, and Western Europe. It has also welcomed manufacturers from
places such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. Shifting factories to China
has meant job losses in some countries, but it’s kept prices low for con-
sumers everywhere.
At first, China manufactured low value-added products, such as toys and sun-
glasses. The country continues to do so, but China is becoming a larger player
in manufacturing high value-added products. For example, China today is a
major producer of semiconductors, mobile phones, and computers.
Surprisingly, China’s manufacturing labor costs — which are a fraction of the
cost in developed countries — aren’t the lowest in the world. Other Asian
countries, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, are developing large manufacturing
bases with lower labor costs. But China’s other advantages equal money-
savers that beat out cheaper locations. Years of dealing with foreign manufac-
turers means China’s policies are more investor-friendly than those of its rivals,
such as Vietnam. With its existing manufacturing base, China offers a one-stop
shop for sourcing inputs for almost any product. Plus, China has better infra-
structure than its Asian competitors because of its massive investments in
roadways, ports, air, and rail over the past couple of decades. Foreign compa-
nies continue to come to China in part because they can get things done more
cheaply overall.
Manufacturers coming to China are generally (but not always) trying to
export their products rather than sell them in China. For info on domestic
sales, see “Reaching untapped domestic markets,” later in this chapter.
Harnessing people power to export services
In addition to manufacturing (see the preceding section), China presents
opportunities for providing services to the rest of the world. With modern
telecommunications, companies can perform many business functions at
locations far away from where they’re used.
China’s plentiful and cheap technical talent makes it a good place for certain
service businesses. A Chinese engineer may cost as little as 10 percent of his
or her counterpart in the developed world. Also, each year, China is graduat-
ing substantially more engineers and scientists than the United States is. The
caveat is that good technical talent isn’t plentiful. If you can hire well or
design your business processes in a way that less-skilled technical people
can add value, then exporting services can work for you.
One way to take advantage of China’s lower wages and technical skills is to
set up internal service divisions in China. For example, Microsoft has a
research and development center in Beijing. (Of course, Microsoft can hire
the best of the best from China, and its R&D center also helps provide market
access in China.) Another approach is to establish outsourcing companies
24
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

that can handle technical work, such as IT programming. Also, some compa-
nies operate call centers in China to service customers from all over the
world. We briefly discuss outsourcing business processes in Chapter 12.
One challenge service exporters face is English proficiency, so you need to
realistically assess your needs and the talent pool. Despite the high number
of college graduates each year, relatively few graduates are fluent in English.
Therefore, some observers think India is a better place for service exports.
China is making progress in improving its English proficiency, though.
Reaching untapped domestic markets
If you have the right product or service and the right plan — and some
knowledge about selling in international markets — you can do very well 
selling to the Chinese. We explain a bit about the development of consumer
culture and the challenges of selling in the domestic market in the following
sections. For more on selling in China, see Chapter 14.
Birth of a consumer culture
China’s domestic markets offer tremendous potential in many areas. After the
communists took over in 1949, China was almost completely closed to Western
(and most foreign) influences for several decades. The 40-plus year period
between 1949 and the early 1990s was a pretty drab time in China. People
mostly dressed the same, usually wearing black, white, and gray clothes in the
style of Mao Ze Dong’s plain clothing. The goods available to consumers were
quite limited — usually just basic necessities. Travel outside of China was
restricted and usually limited to the elite. Basically, people didn’t have much
money, and even if they did, they could do little with it.
Now that China’s economic system has opened up and the semi-market econ-
omy is putting money in people’s pockets, consumer culture is beginning to
flourish. Especially as credit becomes more widely available, you see con-
sumers wanting and buying more and more goods and services. China is 
also seeing an unprecedented wave of urbanization, with millions of Chinese
people moving from the countryside to the cities.
As China creates massive amounts of wealth, it presents growing markets for
all price levels of products. On the high end, mainland Chinese are now among
the world’s biggest purchasers of designer luxury goods and luxury cars.
High-end real estate prices in Beijing and Shanghai are up there with those of
many wealthier Western cities. In terms of the mass market, within a half gen-
eration, goods such as refrigerators, air conditioners, color TVs, and washing
machines have become standard for many tens of millions of people. The
bottom line is that the Chinese are beginning to fall in love with consumption
and are creating lifestyles to match their increasing affluence.
25
Chapter 2: Brushing Up on China Business Basics

Many goods and services are available in the West but have yet to spread
throughout China. And of course, someone can always create a good or ser-
vice specifically for the Chinese market. If you spend a little time in China,
you’ll probably experience a couple of times where you think to yourself,
“What they really need here is. . . .”
Facing the challenges of selling in China
Selling into the Chinese consumer market can be quite rewarding, but it’s a
challenge. Distribution is extremely costly and complex. Also, China is the
fastest-changing consumer market in the world, which requires your company
to constantly create the impression that your offering is new and improved.
Another problem is that the Chinese are extremely price sensitive in many
product categories. Consumers there usually pay more attention to price
than quality. Selling higher-priced products requires training a sales force to
sell in ways that are new to many Chinese. Realize that Chinese people do
pay for products that give them face, or status. In other words, products that
others can see, such as mobile phones, give them face. Products that others
don’t see, such as toasters, don’t.
Competing in the domestic market against products that Chinese companies
manufacture is difficult for foreigners. Many Chinese manufacturers, especially
large ones, have political connections that get them extremely cheap financing
or other bonuses. In some cases, your competitors may be able to sell prod-
ucts for less than what they cost you to manufacture. (Foreign manufacturers
may be better able to compete domestically in China by making components for
products made in China by either foreign or domestic manufacturers — see
Chapter 13 for info on manufacturing.)
China is many discrete markets, each with its own type of consumer, so look
for niches. You also need to be attuned to overarching cultural differences
that affect marketing and product/service acceptance. For example, Chinese
women don’t usually buy tampons because they feel that using an applicator
is too risqué. And Chinese people prefer their skin to be pale, so self-tanning
products tend to meet a chilly reception.
The Experts’ Choices: Some Long-Term
Growth Industries in China
China’s biggest areas of growth are mainly consumer products and financial
services, but they also include real estate, transportation, retailing, pollution
control, and much more. In an economy growing as rapidly as China is, you
see a great deal of long-term growth industries. Here we’ve made a short list
of areas that experts have identified as having particularly bright long-term
growth prospects.
26
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

Services
You can make good money by providing services either to Chinese people
and companies or to other foreigners. On the Chinese side, here are some
areas expected to grow substantially over the long-term:
 Travel
 Financial services
 Education
And here are some growing areas in catering to foreigners:
 Legal
 Consulting
 Manufacturing support
If you want to focus on the foreign consumer business, you can also find good
niches there, depending on your business’s location.
Healthcare
China’s healthcare market should continue to grow rapidly for a number of
years because of China’s aging population, increased wealth, wider availabil-
ity of insurance, and greater interest in health issues. Also, China’s massive
number of smokers (see Chapter 5) may boost demand for healthcare.
You should see opportunities across the board in healthcare — from opening
medical clinics to making and selling pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
Some analysts estimate that the size of the Chinese pharmaceutical market
will be the same size as that of the United States by 2020 — and pharmaceuti-
cals are still rapidly growing in the U.S.!
You may find opportunities in hospital and medical clinic operations in China
(and with such a large number of elderly people in China, long-term care facil-
ities may be quite attractive to investors). The quality of China’s hospitals
varies quite a bit — especially between the cities and rural areas. For several
years now, most Chinese hospitals have been profit oriented. However, many
of them lack modern management methods to both deliver solid care and
generate strong profits. Businesspeople or investors with managerial skills
should find a large, growing market.
If you’re thinking about bringing more-advanced healthcare to China through
foreign doctors and/or high-tech equipment, make sure you understand
whether the market in your target location can afford such services.
27
Chapter 2: Brushing Up on China Business Basics

Environment and energy
As China continues to develop, industrialization leads to increases in energy
consumption and pollution. Your business may be able to help China address
these issues.
A need for clean energy
China’s economic growth is already straining its energy resources. Much of
the increase in oil prices from $25 per barrel not too long ago is due to
China’s growing demand. China’s economy is highly energy dependent — lots
of factories, machines, and mega-cities. And improving standards of living are
demanding ever more energy, too, with millions of people buying cars for the
first time and hundreds of millions of people buying new electronics. If your
business can bring more power or increase power efficiency, a big market
may be waiting for you in China.
China gets most of its electricity from coal, a resource that China has plenty of.
But here’s the major problem: China’s coal-burning plants are clouding the air
not only in China but also as far away as Los Angeles. The government is making
big efforts to produce more energy in less environmentally harmful ways.
China provides business opportunities for companies that can provide clean
energy sources, such as “clean” coal, natural gas, wind power, hydropower,
solar power, and so on. The government has already enacted laws that pro-
vide incentives (such as tax breaks) to investors in those fields. In addition,
because clean energy programs help local governments achieve political
goals, your company may be able to negotiate additional sweeteners. 
(For more on developing government relations, see Chapter 8.)
The energy business in China is difficult in part because the various grid
operators make transmitting electricity quite costly. The government con-
trols the energy sector fairly tightly. One solution is to build power supplies
at the site of the end user. Or you can be a component supplier or build and
operate a power plant.
Getting back to green
China has serious pollution problems throughout the country. Unfortunately,
pollution has badly affected the country’s air, soil, and water supply. China may
be a gold mine for businesses that can help it clean up. Whether your business
performs remediation or can give China a cleaner way to do things, you’re likely
to find a warm welcome from the government and a lot of potential business.
Agribusiness
With 22 percent of the world’s population but only 7 percent of its arable
land, China has too many people to feed. As Chinese people get wealthier,
28
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

they’ll want to eat more — and more expensive — food. Many experts are
projecting that over the next couple of decades, China’s growing affluence
will make the demand for food soar. At the same time, China’s farmland is
rapidly giving way to factories and industry. China’s usable water is also
decreasing due to pollution and overuse. All of this means that China is going
to need a lot more food from abroad, making agribusiness a good place to be.
This trend is already noticeable. During the past several years, prices for
many food commodities, such as soybeans, have gone up quite a bit. Much of
the increase has been due to growing demand from China.
One of the nice things about doing agribusiness with China is that you can do
it from anywhere in the world where you can grow crops and produce food.
Of course, you may also produce food within China, where most farms and
agribusinesses use outdated technology and techniques. Affluent Chinese —
particularly those with children — are now starting to get interested in
organic food out of health concerns, so if organic’s your niche, some of these
old techniques may not need much modification.
Understanding China’s 
Business Environment
China’s business environment is rapidly changing and complex — especially
for foreigners. The following sections should give you a good idea of the 
factors that play the biggest roles in China’s business environment.
The economy: Getting the goods
China’s economic growth is one of the major changes of our time. Over the
past 20 years, its gross domestic product has grown by an average of approx-
imately 11 percent annually. But there’s much more to the story than impres-
sive numbers. Read on.
A history of government ownership and production
When the communists won the civil war in 1949, they began to take control of
banks and most large businesses. Basically, the government started running
the economy. Following the Soviet model and communist doctrine of the
time, the Chinese focused on the rapid development of their heavy industry.
The most important goal of most state-owned business was output, output,
output — even when that meant losing money! China’s economy more or less
stumbled along that way until Chairman Mao Ze Dong died in 1976.
29
Chapter 2: Brushing Up on China Business Basics

Rapid growth and opening markets: China as a social(istic) climber
Since 1976, China’s economic strategy has changed a bit (see Chapter 3). For
one, China didn’t want to collapse the way the Soviet Union did after years of
ignoring calls for economic reform. In the 1990s, the Chinese focused almost
single-mindedly on boosting GDP growth. Their thinking was that high GDP
growth would create jobs — and they were right. China’s investment and 
economic policies opened the country up to foreign investment. At the same
time, the central government gave local and provincial governments a lot of
control over their local economies.
Today, industry accounts for almost half of China’s economic output. Officially,
agriculture is a little over 10 percent, but that number is probably low because
it doesn’t include a large group of subsistence farmers. About 40 percent of the
economy is services.
Private businesses create more jobs than state-owned enterprises (SOEs) do
now because many SOEs are shedding jobs and/or becoming privately owned
in order to become more efficient. Foreign visitors often talk about how China
is now more capitalist than the West — and it’s still supposed to be a commu-
nist country!
Continued government involvement
Despite moving to a much more market-based system, the government still
exercises some old-fashioned economic control. For instance, the govern-
ment keeps tight control over the renminbi (RMB), or yuan. The RMB isn’t
fully convertible (see Chapter 10), which means that you usually can’t
exchange it outside of China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
Also, China still protects some sensitive industries from foreign and even
domestic competition by enacting laws that prohibit or make it hard for 
businesses to compete. Such industries — such as telecom, energy, and air
transportation — may be key to national or economic security.
Or these protected industries may be politically sensitive because they
employ a lot of people or make a lot of money for the government. One 
very high profile example of this was the attempt of the Carlyle Group, an
American private equity firm, to acquire Xugong. Xugong is a profitable state-
owned heavy construction equipment manufacturer; however, the planned
transaction became a political flashpoint in China. Ultimately, Carlyle had to
buy far less of the company than it had planned.
Although the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are becoming a smaller portion
of the economy, they’re still a major force. The government uses them to
carry out policies, such as creating jobs in areas with high unemployment. In
other instances, the government is letting SOEs fail and training the former
workers to work in private industry.

Resulting problems of China’s development
Although the living standards and incomes of virtually all Chinese have
improved during the past 20 years, the economy hasn’t benefited the Chinese
equally. There are enormous (and growing) differences between the haves 
(a relatively small but rapidly increasing number) and the have-nots. About 
1 billion of China’s people live in abject poverty. Three hundred million or so
have achieved at least middle-class lifestyles. Among that 300 million, China
has sizeable numbers of millionaires, making it among the largest markets for
many luxury good sellers.
The differences in progress are clear when you compare areas on the coast
with areas in the interior, cities with the countryside, and the well-educated
with the not-so-well-educated (a relatively large number). Most of China’s
wealth is along the coast, with some wealthy cities farther inland along the
Yangtze River. The have-nots notice the differences in development and
wealth because they were taught that China is a socialist country.
Some of China’s economic growth is from unproductive investments. By
unproductive, we mean that the investment capital is used in a way that 
doesn’t make business sense. When the government gave provinces and
cities a lot of power over economic decisions, the only requirement was that
the local governments deliver GDP growth and jobs. In response, many local
governments went crazy building things — especially skyscrapers, roads, and
bridges. Sure, these projects created jobs and put money into the economy.
But in many cases, funding the projects cost the government much more than
they were worth. Plus, many local governments were kicking peasants and
farmers off land for these frivolous investment projects. (For more on how
the sensitivity of land rights affects your business, see Chapter 7.)
By 2004, almost every small city in China wanted to resemble a mini-Shanghai
and light up the sky at night with dazzling neon displays, which the govern-
ment often paid for. Partly as a result of this and similar waste, China began
having electricity shortages in many areas at this time, even causing factories
to shut down. Private businesses also got into the act, with a number of
industries in China adding capacity at any given time when there was already
too much. Unfortunately, economists can’t even come close to agreeing on
the amount of unproductive growth in China. (The West isn’t immune to this
phenomenon, either — remember the dot-com bubble?)
The road ahead
China’s government has launched a drive to make a “harmonious society,”
the idea being that it’ll be more balanced, particularly economically. The cen-
tral government realizes that to make this idea happen, it needs to reestab-
lish control over parts of the economy that it gave up to local governments in
the 1990s. Don’t expect the local governments to necessarily play along —
they’ve realized it’s good to be king!
31
Chapter 2: Brushing Up on China Business Basics

Going forward, China should continue to grow its manufacturing and to move
into higher-end products. But with China’s rapid aging population, something
will have to eventually give — either the one-child policy or China’s domi-
nance in manufacturing. Services will continue to develop, but China needs
to continue to invest in education to really develop services well. Right now,
India appears to have an edge on China in the service area, mainly because
India has more people who speak English.
One of the really interesting trends to watch over the long-term is how much
consumption grows. Among the world’s largest economies, China has the
lowest amount of consumption as a percentage of GDP. If the Chinese aren’t
consuming, they’re saving. That means that most of the things they produce
are bought in other countries, which becomes a very political issue in the
importing countries. It also eventually limits how much the economy can
grow because the world can import only so much from China. The govern-
ment is actively encouraging Chinese to save a little less and spend a little
more to simulate the domestic economy. We’ll see how it plays out.
Politics: Grasping the state of affairs
Although you should be careful about talking politics with your business
acquaintances in China, having some understanding of the subject definitely
helps. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the Chinese Communist Party (the
CCP). In this section, we discuss the political environment.
A lot of Westerners misunderstand the extent of the CCP’s power. China is a
one-party state, but it’s not held together as tightly as a lot of people think it
is. For most of China’s history, the nation was a feudal society with weak cen-
tral control. A country as massive as China — in land and people — was and
still is very difficult to govern. Each year, China reports many tens of thou-
sands of official “disturbances” in which people have rioted or protested at
least somewhat violently.
Government efforts to modernize the country
For better or worse, the CCP sees itself as the best way for China to modernize
and raise its people’s standard of living. Although Westerners sometimes per-
ceive the CCP’s actions as heavy-handed, the CCP views them as necessary for
the greater good. This divergence in views is most apparent in assessing the
government’s June 1989 reactions to the Tiananmen Square rallies.
The CCP is constantly performing a balancing act. It wants to modernize the
country and provide greater opportunities for its people. In order to modern-
ize, though, China has to end the “Iron Rice Bowl” policies that guaranteed
workers lifelong gainful employment at state-owned enterprises. Because
China has been a poor country until recently, and also because of the effects
of the Cultural Revolution (see Chapter 3), the majority of Chinese people
32

lack modern skills or education. As a result, when a state-owned factory is
privatized and the new owners lay off workers, the outlook for those workers
isn’t bright. The government is trying to address this problem by training
laid-off workers.
The large and growing numbers of displaced workers threaten stability. With
some people in China becoming quite affluent, the unemployed workers’
anger intensifies. For this reason, China often seems to have to take two steps
forward and one step back in its drive to become a modern economy and
society. But despite the need to slow down or postpone some reforms, the
pace of change in China is still incredible.
Suspicion of foreign investors
Foreign investors are always a political issue in China. The Chinese are quite
proud of their rich culture and long history. For centuries, they were an
extremely advanced civilization. However, the Chinese also view themselves
as having been humiliated throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries by
various foreign powers. In the late 1800s, the British actually went to war
with China because the Chinese government tried to stop Great Britain from
selling opium to the Chinese. Foreign wars, such as World War I, often
resulted in treaties that carved up parts of China among foreign nations, with-
out giving China any say-so in the matter. In World War II, the Japanese
invaded China and were so brutal in their occupation that it remains a major
obstacle in their relationship today. When you take a proud people who feel
like they were humiliated by foreigners, you get some mistrust.
On the other hand, the Chinese are practical enough to realize that they can
learn a lot about business from foreigners. They also know that foreign
investment capital is crucial to their economic development. However, you
often see political pressure to protect Chinese businesses from foreign com-
petition. The effectiveness of that pressure varies. Occasionally, it can even
make foreign investors targets of public blame for problems such as environ-
mental pollution and land seizures from peasants and farmers.
The Chinese may be suspicious of each other as well. See the upcoming
“Gaining trust” section for details.
Sudden changes in governmental policies
Chinese politics, even before the CCP took power, have been legendary for
their intrigue and unpredictability. Westerners still can’t totally understand
how the Chinese government works. Some scholars see a constant battle
between reformers and conservatives; other scholars think members of the
government are pretty much on the same page but are just making Westerners
think it has disagreements. Sometimes your Chinese friends may be able to
read the tea leaves and figure out whether a change will affect your business;
other times, the government will catch everybody by surprise.

Chapter 2: Brushing Up on China Business Basics

Culture: Taking in the social scene
Even though you can find some of the most modern cityscapes in the world
in China, China and its people still reflect their thousands of years of cultural
heritage in many ways. Here are the most important cultural differences for
you to understand when you first do business in China.
Staying on the same page
The Chinese place a premium on acting as a group. This idea really means
two things:
 Decisions are often made by consensus rather than by one person.
 Members of the group are expected to fully support and respect the
decision after it’s been made.
Some Westerners who’ve witnessed closed-door Chinese meetings observe
that after enough people (or enough senior people) have stated that they
prefer a certain choice, the rest of the group seems to magically express the
same opinion when asked. So it’s tough to say how much of a consensus is
really behind these “consensus” decisions. Nonetheless, don’t expect a
Chinese person to break ranks with his or her group to help you.
Pulling rank
The Chinese pay a lot of attention to hierarchy. Typically, Chinese employees
are very aware of where they rank in the company food chain. Power always
has its perks in China — and the differences in perks between pay grade are
often not that subtle. Chinese people typically defer in public to people who
34
Part I: Building Your Foundation 
Birth-planning and the labor force
After the famines in the 1960s and 1970s, China
instituted a policy that limited urban families to
one child per household. Some estimates hold
that if there were no one-child policy, China’s
population would be 300 million people larger
than it is today! However, because of the policy,
China is becoming a society with fewer work-
ers to support more retirees. So far the govern-
ment has shown no sign that it plans to get rid 
of the policy, although it has been loosened
slightly.
China’s government isn’t worried about a man-
ufacturing labor shortage now, but because of
the growing number of manufacturers, along
with the one-child policy, the nation may see an
uneven balance of work-to-workers in the long-
term. The birth-planning policy has also had
some small short-term effects. Over the past
few years, wages in China’s two major manu-
facturing regions, the Yangtze River delta
(around Shanghai) and the Pearl River delta (in
Guangdong province), have been rising as man-
ufacturers have had to compete a little harder
for labor.

outrank them in ways that may seem strange to Westerners. For example, on
the way to a casual lunch, junior employees may all but dig their nails into
the doorframe rather than walk through the door before their mid-ranking
colleagues do. For more on hierarchy in the workplace, see Chapter 9.
Don’t assume that subordinate Chinese will appreciate your egalitarian insis-
tence that they’re entitled to the same perks as you are. Breaking with the
system may make some subordinates uncomfortable, even if you think they’re
benefiting from your flexibility. Also, the Chinese may think that you’re disre-
spectful if you don’t respect the higher positions of your superiors.
Saving face
Face is a key cultural concept to understand when doing business in China. If
you cause somebody, even by accident, to lose face (honor), don’t expect to
ever receive their cooperation again. In fact, the consequences can be a lot
more extreme than that. To make sure you don’t make mistakes with face,
read Chapter 11, which also tells you how to give face.
Identifying the in-group
Relationships are an important part of doing business in China (see Chap-
ter 15). One reason is that the Chinese usually don’t trust or even concern
themselves with people who aren’t their friends. This idea has its roots in
Confucian philosophy, but the Cultural Revolution reinforced it. For more on
trust issues, see “Buckle Your Seatbelt: Preparing for Common Challenges,”
later in this chapter.
Laws: Surveying the government say-so
The biggest myth about China is that it’s lawless. China has plenty of laws —
and many of them are actually enforced! Fortunately for businesspeople,
you’ll recognize a lot of the laws governing contracts in China. However, that
doesn’t mean you can rely on your experience dealing with the law else-
where. On the whole, the legal framework is getting better, but many Chinese
laws are intentionally vague. Just know that there are laws to protect you and
laws that pester you. Enforcement can vary by locale, but as we discuss in
Chapters 17 and 18, you can protect your rights. The following sections
explain how laws are written and implemented, as well as the hierarchy.
Vague for a reason
Many of China’s laws are vague to allow officials to use their judgment.
Consistent and clear laws are easier to understand, but on the other hand,
the way some countries rigidly apply their laws regardless of the result
makes the Chinese way seem to make sense. As some say, in China nothing is
permitted, but everything is possible. Thank you, ambiguity!
35
Chapter 2: Brushing Up on China Business Basics

The way Chinese laws are usually enacted may seem strange to many foreign-
ers because the law is usually extremely vague. In fact, it’s usually more or
less just a long statement of legal principles. For example, a law may say that
companies with dominant market share need to receive antitrust approval
before a transaction, but it won’t define dominant. Sometimes, these ques-
tions are answered when the implementing measures come out for a given
law. The implementing measures are regulations that explain how officials are
supposed to interpret and apply the actual law. You may wait for a year for
implementing measures to come out, and then the measures may be vague in
order to give local officials authority to develop their own policies.
Following a hierarchy
Usually, laws enacted by the central government take priority over provincial
government laws, which usually take priority over municipal government
laws. Finding laws enacted by different levels of government that are in com-
plete conflict with each other isn’t unusual. Even stranger, you may find laws
enacted at the same level (national, provincial, or municipal) that conflict!
Even laws on the same tier have a hierarchy.
China is an administrative state, which means that various bureaucracies can
issue their own laws and regulations — this is a significant risk to foreign
businesses. Explaining the hierarchies is beyond the scope of this book, but
just know that it can be complicated, so get expert advice from lawyers when
you encounter conflicting laws and regulations. For more on dealing with
lawyers and other professionals, see Chapter 4.
Laws dealing with foreign investments
Some laws deal specifically with foreign investments. They may restrict how
much of businesses you can own in certain areas. Just keep in mind that you
have to pay attention to a combination of laws, especially those that discuss
foreign companies.
36
Part I: Building Your Foundation 
The legal suggestion box
All levels of the Chinese government are con-
stantly at work making new laws. Fortunately,
the process is becoming more open. With many
important laws, the government now circulates
drafts of the laws before they make the laws
official. That way, lawyers, businesses, and
other people who have a stake in the law are
able to comment. The best way for you to give
feedback on a draft law is to contact your coun-
try’s chamber of commerce in China and ask
them to convey your views. The government’s
even listening to the comments, too!

Buckle Your Seatbelt: Preparing 
for Common Challenges
For many people, the challenge is one of the reasons that succeeding in China
is so rewarding. Here are some common obstacles to prepare for.
Gaining trust
Trust is a big part of doing business in China. The country doesn’t have a
credit rating system, so a lot of business is done on faith. Earning trust with
the Chinese is a challenge, but you want to earn it, so be patient. Don’t be
surprised if your business is moving slowly until you’ve earned the trust of
others. Then it’ll start picking up speed.
Ironically, Chinese people are often less likely to trust other Chinese than they
are to trust an outsider. In fact, some Western businesspeople in China ques-
tion whether employees’ inability to trust each other will prevent Chinese
companies from becoming true global competitors. If you’re going to be man-
aging Chinese employees, understand that they’re usually suspicious of each
other. You’ll have to work hard to encourage your employees to be open about
their work and cooperate.
Although the majority of people you meet in China are fair businesspeople,
some people may try to screw you over, so don’t trust anybody too much.
Don’t give people too much access to your proprietary knowledge or too
much money. And don’t make it obvious that you don’t trust them, which can
cause them to lose face. If push comes to shove, though, letting people figure
out that you don’t completely trust them may be a lot cheaper than a major
mistake on your part! See Chapter 17 for more on protecting yourself.
Wading through the bureaucracy
You commonly hear that China’s very bureaucratic. It’s true! China is the per-
fect storm where the Soviet love of bureaucracy meets the tradition of thou-
sands of years of vast imperial bureaucracies. For the businessperson trying
to get something done in China, this legacy means working with government
agencies (Chapter 8 discusses dealing with the government). Even relatively
simple tasks, such as setting up a company, usually require the approval of
multiple agencies. Often, you have to shuffle back and forth between agen-
cies. Don’t expect them to cooperate with each other or to be on the same
page. Quite the contrary — China’s government agencies often compete to
get responsibility for implementing new laws when the laws are unclear
about who’ll implement them and how they’ll be implemented.
37
Chapter 2: Brushing Up on China Business Basics

And don’t expect government agencies to compete with each other to pro-
vide you with the best service. Rather, various agencies may tell you that you
need their approvals, and those approvals often have differing requirements.
One advantage that Special Economic Zones (SEZs), which we discuss in
Chapter 7, usually provide is that they help streamline many of the agency
processes.
Chinese bureaucracy also means lots of paperwork. The government gives
you lots of forms to fill out in order to move forward. Often, these forms ask
you the same questions repeatedly. You also have to bring a lot of papers
relating to you and your business with you when you deal with government
agencies. Chapter 7 explains the paperwork you need to set up shop.
Finally, the bureaucracy means using lots and lots of chops, or official com-
pany and agency seals. They appear on almost every official document as an
organization’s signature. When you get company chops made, you usually
have to do so at a licensed chop maker.
Responding to rapid changes
The pace of change in China is both amazing and daunting. Keeping up with
the changes — especially in laws and regulations — is difficult for foreigners.
The best way to prepare yourself is to join business organizations, such as
your country’s chamber of commerce or a business council (see Chapter 4
for some resources). Having good relationships with government officials can
also help. They can sometimes give you a heads-up that a change is coming.
Surviving cutthroat competition
The Chinese are excellent businesspeople. But they’re not as good at seeing
the big picture, nor are they as sophisticated about deciding whether to start
businesses — and this lack of preparation can be a big problem, because the
Chinese love to be entrepreneurs. China really began to reform its economy
only recently, so the lack of the big-picture view and sophistication should
change as people become more educated in market economics.
In China, many aspiring entrepreneurs decide to go into business without
thinking about the size of the market and how much competition it can
handle. Instead, they choose a certain business after they see a few business
owners in that industry driving fancy cars. And they all seem to do it immedi-
ately, so all of a sudden, competitors start pouring and pouring in. If they do,
they’ll commoditize your business. When this happens, everybody’s margins
drop to the point where barely anyone is making money. Most of the time, a
lot of businesses (first movers and newcomers) go under.
38
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

If you’re successful, plan for an onslaught of competition. Here’s how:
 Always have money. Be conservative with investments so you have cash
on hand to survive a shakeout.
 Delay the onslaught by not being too obvious about your success.
 Try to enter a business that’s very hard to copy and commoditize.
 Protect your company’s IP (including trademarks) through legal and
practical measures. See Chapter 17 to find out how.
 Create or bring a recognizable brand, which is easier to protect.
 Conduct thorough market research before going to China. For more on
planning for China, see Chapter 4.
 Never provide exclusive distributorships in China. Always establish mul-
tiple distribution channels (see Chapter 13).
If you do get hit by a wave of competition, know that the industry should
recover within a few years. Also, if you’re able to stay liquid, you can buy out
your competitors when they’re desperate. Then you’ll be in an even better
position!
Bridging the language gap
One of the most important things to get right is bridging the language gap.
The following sections discuss both the written and spoken word.
Speaking up through interpreters
The quality of your interpreter, who works with speech, says a lot about you
and your company to the Chinese. With knowledge of the language and your
business, interpreters can do more than just convert one language into
another; they can help you understand whether the Chinese side really got
the message and whether you’re getting closer to reaching your objective.
You may be lucky enough to have someone in your company do the interpre-
tation for you. However, representing your company and being your com-
pany’s interpreter at the same time is difficult — most people playing a dual
role miss important items. Businesspeople acting as interpreters also often
throw in their own thoughts or change what they’re interpreting without the
principal or Chinese party’s knowledge.
Interpreters don’t have to be expensive — if you’re simply building relation-
ships (see Chapter 15), Chinese university students may be qualified for the
job. If you’ve done some networking, your contacts may be able to recom-
mend people. Of course, professional interpreters are always an option, but
they may be pricey.
39
Chapter 2: Brushing Up on China Business Basics

For formal meetings, there’s no substitute for a professionally trained inter-
preter. He or she may not understand your company, industry, and objectives
in China, but you can benefit by getting the interpreter involved early in the
planning stages of business meetings. See Chapter 11 for advice on using
interpreters at meetings.
Many Chinese companies offer interpreting services. The best way to find an
interpreter is through a referral. Do your due diligence on the interpreter’s
capabilities before putting him or her in front of your Chinese contacts. Ask
for references. You want your interpreter to have more than just good
English. It’s important that your interpreter be experienced so that he or she
is good at conveying long stretches of speech. If you think your interpreter is
ineffective or unprofessional, look for a new one. Find someone neutral who’s
also bilingual to give you feedback on the quality of the interpreter.
When using an interpreter, make sure your Chinese contacts understand that
you’re the boss. If you’re the leader, you should sit directly across from or
next to the main decision-maker. Also make sure that your interpreter knows
that he or she shouldn’t offer an opinion on anything other than a language
issue, even if the Chinese side asks. If asked for an opinion, he or she should
defer to you. Particularly in a social setting, watch to make sure that your
interpreter doesn’t overshadow you.
Getting it in writing with translators
As with interpreters, you should do your due diligence when looking for
people to translate your written material into Chinese. You have two options
for how you want a document translated:
 You can have it translated and rewritten. By translating and rewriting,
you can hopefully ensure that documents read smoothly. However, find-
ing someone who can translate and rewrite can be difficult, and judging
the quality of the rewrite may be a challenge.
Don’t have legal documents rewritten after they’re translated into
Chinese. The usual practice — a direct, literal translation — ensures
accuracy.
 You can have it translated directly into Chinese. A direct translation may
convey the point to the Chinese, but it’ll read strangely. When you’re in
China, you’ll undoubtedly see a lot of strange English signage — particu-
larly in advertising. Much of this results from direct translation.

History and Leadership
In This Chapter
 Getting to know China’s history and rise as an economic superstar
 Discovering how the government encourages business
 Understanding the Communist Party
 Looking at China’s entry into the World Trade Organization
C
hina has had a long and colorful history over many thousands of years,
and knowing a few of its key elements can help you better understand
today’s general business practices in China. By showing that you know some
Chinese history, you can also demonstrate to the Chinese business commu-
nity that you’re serious about doing business there.
The rise of the Communist Party made a tremendous impact on modern
China. The party still sets policy and controls the future direction of China,
so you want to understand how the government works. This knowledge is
especially important as China moves from a centrally planned economy to a
market-driven one. And with China’s entry into the World Trade Organization,
the country is taking a big step forward as a major player in global business
and trade.
In this chapter, we give you an overview of China’s political and economic
history and explain how it affects China’s business climate today. We also go
into China’s current government setup as well as the government’s relation-
ship with state-owned companies, private businesses, and foreign-owned
enterprises. Finally, we wrap up with the impact of China’s entry into the
World Trade Organization.

Understanding the Big, 
Historical Picture
China’s civilization is one of the oldest on the planet, dating back almost
4,000 years. Of course, you don’t have to go back quite that far to get an idea
of the historical events that shaped China’s current business scene. The 
following sections give you a briefing on some of the more pivotal events and
situations. Understanding some Chinese history is essential so you sound
knowledgeable about China in front of your business partners or contacts.
Introducing the Middle Kingdom: 
The rule of dynasties
The founding father of imperial China was Qin Shi Huang, or the First
Emperor. Shi Huang was a member of the Qin (pronounced chin), the
strongest kingdom in China at the time. They came into power in 221 BCE.
Before Qin’s rule, China was controlled by smaller and less powerful king-
doms that didn’t recognize any central government in China. Qin brought the
country together.
Qin’s accomplishments are considered to be among the greatest of any ruler
in the history of the world. Qin standardized the written language, weights
and measures, and coins. He also expanded China’s borders by seizing terri-
tory in the south and to the north of China and was the impetus behind the
first Great Wall northwest of Beijing and the marvelous Terracotta Army sol-
diers in Xi’an.
Qin developed the imperial system in China that would last for more than
2,000 years. Along the way, China made incredible advances in science, medi-
cine, military, agriculture, and more, making China one of the most advanced
civilizations in the world for a long, long time — a great source of Chinese
pride. (In today’s China, the leadership is looking for the country to modern-
ize and advance, too, from space exploration to leading-edge technology to
the most sophisticated hydropower capabilities in the world.) The First
Emperor set the stage for future emperors to rule a larger, more powerful,
unified Middle Kingdom.
Following the Qin were many other dynasties including the Han, Song, Tang,
Yuan, Ming, and the Qing, the last dynasty. There was little handing down of
power from generation to generation. Old dynasties were overthrown by new,
more powerful dynasties for centuries. Finally, the early 20th century brought
an end to imperial rule.

Ushering in modern China and the 
rise of the Communist Party
In the mid-19th century, China had some bad experiences with foreign influ-
ences. The West was entering its Age of Imperialism, and everyone seemed 
to want a piece of China — and its markets. The British insisted on selling
opium to China, even though using the drug was illegal in both countries. This
dispute led to two wars, and the eventual peace treaty forced China to open
ports to foreign trade, set low tariffs, pay war reparations, allow foreign mission-
aries and embassies within the mainland, and hand over Hong Kong to the U.K.
Other Western nations — and Japan and Russia — sought similar perks through
other not-entirely-equal treaties. Foreigners made their own laws in China. And
the Chinese, on their own soil, were governed by foreign laws. This was a great
insult to the Chinese. Many Chinese are wary of foreigners to this day.
Famines, opium wars, military defeats, economic hardship, poverty, and
Chinese tradition weakened the leaders’ rules. Qing leaders were incapable of
managing the foreign occupation of China’s cities. Civil unrest was on the rise.
Anti-foreign sentiment came to a head in the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901),
when Chinese peasants began attacking foreign railroads, embassies, and 
missions. Western powers banded together and suppressed the uprising, and
many Chinese people lost faith in the current government and saw the need to
modernize. China’s last dynasty finally collapsed in 1911 because of internal
pressures and foreign influences.
Competing warlords once again fought for power. A leader named Sun 
Yat-Sen, considered the founder of modern China, attempted to organize a
new democratic government in China after the fall of the last dynasty but
failed to do so due to competing warlords and other forces. He died in the
mid-1920s, and one of his followers, Chiang Kai-shek, gained control of the
Kuomintang, or National Party (KMT). The KMT loosely unified all of China.
Meanwhile, a new political faction called the Communist Party of China (CCP)
formed in 1921 in opposition to the KMT. Soon the two forces were involved
in a Chinese civil war. During the Long March, a Communist retreat to get
away from the Kuomintang army, a young man named Mao Ze Dong made a
name for himself. After 20 years of war on China’s soil, the civil war ended
and the Communist revolution had won. Mao and his Red Army defeated the
Kuomintang. On October 1, 1949, Mao Ze Dong established the People’s
Republic of China and the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan. As they say, the
rest is history.
The Civil War ended in the 1950s with the CCP in control of mainland China.
The nationalists (KMT) fled to Taiwan before the Communists could retake it,
and the U.S Navy’s 7th fleet was sent into the Taiwan Straits. This move guar-
anteed the separation of Taiwan from the mainland. Taiwan’s leaders claimed
to be the legitimate government of China, which caused friction between
Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China that still goes on today.
43
Chapter 3: Getting Acquainted with the Powers That Be

Industrializing with Mao: 
The first five-year plans
In 1954, Mao Ze Dong was made chairman of the Communist Party of China.
His goal was to make China a great socialist state and a world power. China
was a mess after decades of war and hardship for its citizens. Hundreds of
millions of peasants were barely getting by. Mao borrowed the planning
model from neighboring Russia. After forming the People’s Republic of China,
Mao created its first five-year plan.
Mao’s first five-year plan in 1952 called for China to industrialize with the
help of Russia, which sent about 10,000 industrial engineers to China. Soon,
China started to develop new industries while improving old ones. It was
such a success that China developed another five-year plan. For the first time
in a long time, things were looking pretty good for China.
The second five-year plan in 1957 was interrupted by the Great Leap Forward.
Unfortunately, it was anything but. Because of some bad judgments by Mao
(and to be fair, some extremely bad luck with the weather), food production
fell drastically. In the years of the Great Leap Forward, China experienced one

Sending in the Red Guards
First-time visitors to China often note the cal-
lousness of the Chinese toward one another.
Much of this relates to the Cultural Revolution.
It’s the one mistake that many Chinese are offi-
cially willing to admit that Mao made. In 1966,
Mao was over 70 years old, facing some public
criticism, and possibly losing some power. He
decided to rally China’s youth and university stu-
dents against what he saw as a CCP that was
losing touch with the revolutionary ideals of the
People’s Republic of China. He convinced the
Party that China was leaning toward capitalism.
The Party allowed Mao and his close circle to
begin a campaign to rid the party of any and all
threats. And so began the Cultural Revolution.
It started by trying to create zeal among stu-
dents, but quickly spiraled out of control. China’s
schools and universities were shut down 
for years because academics were considered
counterrevolutionary. Public humiliation of
honest people, the banishment of doctors and
intellectuals to farms in the countryside, book
burnings, the damaging of Chinese cultural
relics, and other horrors were regular events
during the Cultural Revolution. In perhaps the
darkest time of the revolution, intellectuals and
party officials were sent to prison camps for
reeducation.
People who had grudges against each other
frequently tagged their enemies as counter-
revolutionary, even if it wasn’t true. That “enemy”
often ended up beaten or killed by a mob. Family
members testified against their own blood in
order to avoid being accused themselves. The
Revolution created a sense of paranoia so deep
that people worried more about protecting their
own lives than using the truth to save others. No
one felt safe, and the whole country was terri-
fied by Mao’s Red Guards. The Cultural
Revolution ended in 1976 after Mao died, but its
effects linger even today.

of the worst famines in the history of the world. Millions of people died from
starvation.
Many people became disillusioned with the Chinese communist leadership.
Most of the ordinary Chinese people went back to the old ways of doing
things. Because of mass starvation in some rural areas, local leaders and
peasants took matters into their own hands by reinstating private land own-
ership for farming.
Mao gave up his title as president of China, and a junior Chinese leader
named Deng Xiaoping took over after 1976 to clean up Mao’s mess. Deng and
others restored order to the Chinese country and economy in the early
1980s. Despite his failings, Mao is viewed as a cult figure today.
Opening the door to foreign investment
After Chairman Mao Ze Dong died, Deng Xiaoping gained more authority in
the late 1970s. Deng never held the top government job, but he primarily
wielded the power. Deng wanted to modernize China by introducing faster
reforms, saying about capitalism versus communism, “Black cat or white cat,
either will do as long as it catches mice.”
Deng and his comrades created the Open Door Policy, which allowed foreign
investment into China for the first time since the founding of the People’s
Republic of China. Deng saw the need for China to modernize and to open to
the outside world after too many years of isolation. In the early 1980s, China
opened its first Special Economic Zones (SEZs), mainly in coastal cities,
which allowed for more flexible and capitalist policies. Foreign money began
rushing into the SEZs — mostly in manufacturing. The SEZ experiment was a
huge success, and the government began relaxing its control of the economy.
The government then started to let private (initially mainly Chinese)
investors buy state-owned companies (more commonly called state-owned
enterprises, or SOEs) and even created stock exchanges.
Deng Xiaoping called this system socialism with Chinese characteristics, which
is now China’s official term to describe its economy. (For more information
on China’s economy, go to Chapter 2.) Some other people describe it as
market socialism. China’s mixed economy allows private and state-owned
businesses to compete in the marketplace. But socialism isn’t fading away
altogether; after all, China is a party-state government.
With some exceptions, the socialist market structure now in place sets its
own prices based on supply and demand. China’s government generally
allows the market to work by itself with little interference except in sensitive
areas such as currency exchange, strategic industries (such as telecommuni-
cations and energy), and anything related to the military industrial complex.

Party On: Understanding 
Who Controls the Country
Communism is an ideology that stands for the redistribution of resources: from
each according to ability, to each according to need. In practice, one political
party controls the social, political, and economic activity of the country.
The Constitution of the People’s Republic of China states that the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) is the ruling party, but it leaves room for the estab-
lishment of others. The CCP is supposed to get its ideas from the people. In
reality, it’s more of a top-down than bottom-up government. China has more
than one political party, but the other parties exist to bolster the CCP.
The government structure has three bodies:
 The Chinese Communist Party (CCP): Establishes policies and direction
for the country
 The state: Implements and carries out the policies through various
branches, councils, and ministries
 The military (People’s Liberation Army, or PLA): Provides security and
enforcement on a national level
Overall, the CCP runs China’s national, provincial, and local governments as
well as the military. The following sections fill you in on government roles
and some of the major players. The structure can be confusing for foreigners,
but the chart at www.uschina.org/index/browse.php?cat=166 can
help clarify.
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
The CCP started out with fewer than 100 members in Shanghai in 1921. Now
headquartered in Beijing, the capital city of China, it has about 70 million
members.
46

Overseas Chinese
The Chinese have emigrated all over the world.
Many of the emigrants are now significant
investors in China. Those who live abroad, the
overseas Chinese, are estimated to number
more than 60 million. The most significant pock-
ets are in Southeast Asia, the U.S., and Canada.
Your company may be able to use this talent
pool to its advantage. About 200,000 foreign-
trained and -educated Chinese have returned to
China in recent years. They’re commonly called
sea turtles, or hai gui, because they’re return-
ing to where they were born.

The CCP has formal authority. It sets policy and controls the agenda, and the
state carries out the CCP decisions. Today, the Chinese Communist Party is in
total control!
The general secretary of the CCP — the top dog in the party — runs the show.
The general secretary is also the president of China. (Note: The president title
is ceremonial — having the president post alone doesn’t mean you have any
power.) He or she also manages all the committees under the National
People’s Congress (NPC), the government’s legislative body (see the section
“The People’s Congress and other lawmakers” later in this chapter).
The highest-ranking party officials — including the general secretary — are
part of the Central Committee. It’s the highest authority within the CCP, but it
doesn’t exercise authority over the state. The committee is a very small
group of people who are part of the inner circle of party officials who run the
show. These powerful people have a lot of clout.
For more information about the CCP, go to their official Web site:
www.china.org.cn/english/features/44506.htm.
The state
The second body of China’s government is the state. It includes the State
Council, the president, the National People’s Congress, and various ministries
and commissions.
The State Council and its ministries and commissions
The State Council is the main supreme executive body, which means that it
has the power to decide how to enforce China’s laws. The State Council can
also make laws. Its leaders — the premier (the head of the government), sev-
eral vice premiers, and various commissioners — are the next highest-ranking
big shots in China after the general secretary of the Communist Party (who
doubles as president of China, or head of state). About 50 leaders in the State
Council have voices running the administration for the government. The
State Council technically reports to the National Peoples Congress (NPC), the
central government’s legislative branch (see the next section).
The ministers and government officials who lead China’s 28 ministries and
commissions report to the State Council leaders. These officials include such
heavyweights as the Minister of Finance, the Minster of Commerce, and the
Minister of Foreign Affairs. Others reporting to the State Council include key
Chinese organizations such as the Chinese Banking Regulatory Commission,
the state-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission, and the
Xinhua News Agency. (The Xinhua news agency stands for the New China
news agency, and it handles all the public relations and government news for
the CCP.)
47
Chapter 3: Getting Acquainted with the Powers That Be

The People’s Congress and other lawmakers
The People’s Congresses are part of the legislative government body. They
have many different levels that eventually decide who represents the local
people at the national level. China holds elections for local People’s Congress
representatives. Of course, candidates for the elections must be nominated
by the CCP. In reality, the political leaders at the top of the government pick
the people they want to move up. The hierarchy works like this:
1. National
2. Provincial
3. Regional/municipal
4. County
5. Township
6. Village
Those who are elected at the highest level get to participate as members of
the National People’s Congress (NPC). The NPC has fewer than 3,000 members
who are elected to five-year terms. A Standing Committee of the NPC consists
of 170 full-time members. Its members draft most of the NPC’s laws.
The planning and elections take place every five years. The NPC meets every
year in the Great Hall of the People, but the first year that the NPC meets is
really the most important — at that time, the members approve the agenda
for the next five years and also elect the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party (see the earlier section on the CCP). The Central
Committee sits above the rest of the NPC (which is called the General
Committee) and really runs the show — it includes the top ten or so most
senior Chinese party officials.
Several other branches of the government have the ability to make or change
laws, including the State Council and some of the 28 ministries. Sometimes
you encounter conflicts in the law because more than one government body
has the right to make laws. The laws do follow some form of hierarchy. For
instance, the State Council enacts far more laws than the NPC, but when the
NPC passes a law, it’s superior to State Council laws. The Supreme Court
sorts out these conflicts.
The People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
The third branch of the government is the powerful People’s Liberation Army
(PLA). As the most populated country in the world, China also has the
biggest army. The PLA has more than 2 million soldiers! In practice, it’s a vol-
untary army, though registering with the PLA is mandatory for all men when
they turn 18 years old.
48
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

As the PLA reports into the party, it supports government policy. The PLA
technically reports to two military commissions and not the State Council.
The heads of the military commissions are civilian members of the CCP. In
the end, the PLA reports to the president of China (see “The Chinese
Communist Party [CCP],” earlier in this chapter). Here’s the main thing you
need to understand about the PLA and the government: The Communist
Party is in control.
Figuring Out the Chinese Business Scene
The most common types of businesses in China include the following:
 Companies owned by the government: China still has many state-
owned companies kicking around — they’re a product of the old days
when the government owned everything. Although they play a lesser
role in today’s economy, these companies are still significant in China.
 Privately owned Chinese companies: Privately owned companies are
fast becoming the backbone of the business scene in China. Supporting
smaller businesses has become a priority for the Chinese government.
 Foreign-invested companies: Foreign investors from nearly every
corner of the world — large, brand-name multinationals to small- to
medium-sized family-owned companies — continue to flock to China.
The business scene is constantly changing, with a lot of relatively new busi-
nesses flourishing while many larger, older, and unprofitable companies bite
the dust. All in all, China is teeming with young and old, large and small, and
private and state-owned companies. (For more on China’s economy, please
see Chapter 2.)
Getting state-owned businesses in shape
When China first started down the path to fix its economy, the state owned
almost all of China’s businesses. In the late 1970s, about 80 percent of China’s
gross domestic product came from state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The SOEs
provided most of the jobs for China’s hundreds of millions of workers. The
big state companies also gave the workers social and healthcare benefits and
a place to live. Unfortunately, many of the SOEs were unprofitable and caused
a financial drain on China’s government.
The SOEs didn’t need to be profitable. After all, China was a planned econ-
omy, where the state set production quotas. SOE managers didn’t understand
market forces, and they weren’t supposed to. However, China’s leadership
recognized that to modernize, they needed to reform the SOEs, which weren’t
prepared for the socialist market economy China’s leaders were creating. So
49
Chapter 3: Getting Acquainted with the Powers That Be

the Chinese leadership made some big changes in SOEs. They chose to keep
the good ones and shut down, sell, or auction off the bad ones, which was no
easy task. Many of these state-managed companies were the only employers
the Chinese workers ever knew. The change was a painful process for compa-
nies and workers who were used to the security of lifetime employment.
The Chinese leadership made big bets that certain state-owned companies
could compete and prosper against foreign companies. With a little help from
protectionist policies, this approach worked well in many industries, includ-
ing telecommunications, power, and financial-service companies.
Now China has only about 20,000 SOEs operating in the whole of China, down
from more than 120,000 in the mid-1990s. The number of SOEs is fast shrink-
ing as the number of new privately owned companies grows by leaps and
bounds. Even some foreign companies are buying companies that were SOEs.
Supporting private businesses
As China marches to the beat of a new socialist market economy, it knows it
needs to support private businesses in a big way. Supporting privately owned
businesses took time for the Chinese. After all, China’s a socialist country!
Why the big shift in attitude to allow private businesses to grow and prosper?
When China’s leaders decided to unload unprofitable SOEs by selling them or
shutting them down, it needed to create jobs for the unemployed and the
huge number of people entering the workforce. Privately owned businesses
are helping create more new jobs, which China needs so it can keep its fast-
growing population employed.
The Chinese government is making sure the smaller companies can participate
in China’s booming economy, too. Small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) are at a
huge disadvantage to the large foreign and domestic companies operating in
China. For example, SMEs have more problems getting access to money to
invest in their businesses. They’re not as powerful as the big companies in
terms of influence and guan xi (relationships — see Chapter 15). The govern-
ment helps smaller companies in a variety of ways, including designing special
laws and regulations. For instance, under China’s SME Promotion Law, the gov-
ernment has set up a credit rating system and offered management training, too.
China has many good reasons to support SMEs: They represent 99 percent of
all companies in China! The total number of registered SMEs is around 5 mil-
lion companies. They contribute more than 60 percent of the total industrial
output in China.
Privately owned companies are creating the first wave of really wealthy entre-
preneurs in China. This development is significant within China. Many of
China’s new entrepreneurs have very deep pockets and are formidable com-
petitors for foreign companies.

Encouraging foreign investors
The leaders of the country figured out pretty quickly that they needed for-
eign investors to help China change and grow. The government leaders knew
China could attract the biggest and best multinationals from around the
world. After all, what multinational company (or any other for that matter)
can ignore a market with a population of 1.3 billion people?
The road wasn’t easy. Convincing foreign multinationals that the business
environment was stable took many years. And some bumps along the way —
such as the Tiananmen Square incident — rattled a few foreign investors. But
many of the foreign companies that stayed the course in China are very prof-
itable today.
When China began looking more stable, more foreign companies considered
going to China. And come they did! Multinational company investment is
pouring into China. All the major global companies are making big invest-
ments in China. Chinese government authorities say that 480 of the largest
500 companies in the world are already invested in China. Most large globally
minded companies see China as a top priority for their business and plan to
invest even more in the future.
China has attracted more investment by foreign companies over the past 15
years than any other developing country in the world. The latest figure is
that China has received around US$700 billion since it opened its door to for-
eign investment. China is like a big magnet for foreign investment.

Chapter 3: Getting Acquainted with the Powers That Be
Growing a small business: From bicycle shop 
to auto parts powerhouse
The son of a Chinese farmer, Lu Guanqiu, built a
modern enterprise called Wanxiang Group (pro-
nounced wan-shang) from a small bicycle
repair shop he started in 1969. Today, Lu, the
founder and chairman of the company, is one of
the richest people in China.
The multinational company, headquartered
about 100 miles east of Shanghai, is now the
second-largest privately owned firm in China
and is aggressively expanding overseas. It’s fast
becoming one of the major players in U.S.-China
trade. Wanxiang is China’s largest car parts
manufacturer, and it’s involved in finance, real
estate, import and export, and other interests as
well. The company has 40,000 employees world-
wide and US$4.2 billion in sales.
China’s leadership has made the commitment to
support China’s globally minded companies
through deal financing and risk management,
and Wanxiang is a shining example of the type
of firm China wants to support. Its humble
beginnings as an SME give China’s leaders
every reason to be proud. If your business in
China can provide products, support, or ser-
vices to these successful homegrown compa-
nies, you’re in a good position to succeed.

Benefiting from the five-year plan
The five-year plan is a roadmap for the Communist leadership to tell the
country the direction the Party wants to take. It’s also a way for the Party to
rally support internally, set targets and future priorities for the country, and
determine which industries to encourage foreign investment in.
The government’s main priority is to build a “harmonious society” in China.
In other words, China doesn’t want an imbalance between the haves and the
have-nots, instead preferring a growth that benefits a wider group of Chinese
people. Here are the main thrusts of the 2006–2010 plan:
 Improve noncoastal economies: China doesn’t want to have too wide a
gap between the wealthy coastal areas and the poorer inland provinces,
so it’s placing greater emphasis on improving the lives of people in the
countryside and developing western China. Infrastructure has been a
problem in developing the region.
 Strengthen service industries and improve industry: China’s leaders
want greater balance between industrial growth and the service sector.
Therefore, the government will support faster growth particularly in 
52

Going forward: Risks on the horizon
According to the World Bank, China is the
fourth-largest economy in the world based on
gross domestic product (GDP). It’s a major
player in the global economy. If you adjust for
purchasing power differentials, China is already
the world’s second-largest economy. Growing
at a faster clip than any other major nation, it’s
on course to surpass the United States as the
world’s largest economy within two decades.
But with such heady growth come risks and
concerns. Here are some issues that can poten-
tially lead to an economic slowdown:
 The disparity between the haves and the
have-nots is growing in modern China. The
amount of social unrest is rising, which may
destabilize China’s economic development.
 The continued debate and uneasiness
about China’s currency revaluation causes
concern in the financial markets. On one
hand, if China responds to pressure from
other countries to appreciate the RMB (see
Chapter 10), but does so too quickly, China’s
economic growth may slow a good deal. On
the other hand, if China appreciates the
RMB too slowly, some of China’s trading
partners (particularly the U.S.) may take
protectionist measures, which would also
hurt China’s economy.
 Although China marches down the path
toward a socialist market economy, little
political reform is going on in the country.
 China’s environmental problems continue to
worsen, despite the fact that the central
government leaders call the environment a
priority.
 Disputes with other governments may lead
to disruptions in China’s ability to import
energy and vital commodities. One such
trigger would be a war with Taiwan.

service industries. As for industrial growth, China’s leaders don’t think
more is better — they want structural upgrades.
 Save resources: China wants to save natural resources by reducing its
dependency on commodities such as oil, gas, and coal. With soaring
energy needs in China, the government wants to explore alternative energy
and support conservation. It also needs to deal with water shortages.
 Become cleaner: China’s government wants to decrease the widespread
pollution of the land, water, and air.
Several other important areas in the five-year plan include education, social
security and insurance, and healthcare. To find out more about China’s five-
year plan, go to english.gov.cn/special/115y_index.htm.
As China sets out its priorities in the five-year plan, it’s telling you and your
business what opportunities lie ahead in China. China has a proven track
record of assisting foreign firms that help China realize its goals. If your busi-
ness happens to be in pollution control, healthcare, agriculture, services, or
any one of the sectors highlighted in the plan, you’re one step in the right
direction already. For more on investment opportunities, go to Chapter 7.
China and the World Trade Organization
In many ways, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) was a
historic event that changed many of the old ways of doing business in China.
China’s membership defines how China’s market will open to foreign competi-
tion in both goods and services and sets out a timetable of China’s commit-
ments. The agreement not only opens China’s market but also puts in place a
defined set of rules that’ll make foreign investment and trade more pre-
dictable in China.
Here are the two biggest impacts of China’s entry into the WTO:
 China must adhere to the WTO’s rules for doing business.
 China must open up more businesses to foreign involvement.
For more information on the implications of China’s membership in the WTO,
check out China and the WTO: Changing China, Changing World Trade (Wiley).
And of course, read on.
Agreeing to play by the WTO rules
The World Trade Organization (WTO), an international organization that
helps promote global trade and commerce, defines rules that are designed to
53
Chapter 3: Getting Acquainted with the Powers That Be

help all member countries play fairly in the global market. The WTO has 150
members representing most countries in the world.
When members of the WTO don’t agree with each other, the WTO acts as the
official umpire on trading disagreements. The WTO’s mission is to help the
global economy go about its business as smoothly as possible. In China, the
WTO is trying to make rules for global trade and services clearer for investors
and to create a system that’s fair to all who are interested in investing there.
Getting the world’s most populous country and fastest-growing economy to
join the club was a huge breakthrough for world trade. At more than 15 years,
China had the longest application process for any member to join the WTO.
The country made the bold decision to join in the early 1980s, and the process
was finalized on December 11, 2001. In the end, more than 900 pages of legal
documents were submitted with China’s application.
The U.S. government played a significant role in China’s entry into the WTO,
though China saw the benefits as well. The Chinese leaders know that they
have to play by the WTO rules in order to become a major player in today’s
global economy.
Changing how China does business
Under the WTO, China agreed to a timetable for changing the way it does its
business. The agreement makes changes to key investment areas such as
financial services and logistics, China’s legal system (including intellectual
property rights), and import and export rules (tariffs, quotas, and approvals).
China is under a yearly review process by the WTO authorities. Along the
way, China has made some good progress, but there are some concerns
about whether the country is making all the required changes.
The first five years as a member of the WTO required China to open up cer-
tain protected industries that were off-limits to foreign competition. These
industries included banking, telecom, and retail, where some Chinese compa-
nies are market leaders. The phase-in period to WTO also expected China to
get tougher on enforcing copyright protection to reduce counterfeiting of
popular Western consumer brands. China introduced many new laws to 
clarify its new commitments to the WTO.
China today says it’s open for business and is obeying all the rules under its
WTO obligations. Some critics — especially the U.S. — say China didn’t meet
some of the promises made to the WTO and that China’s track record is mixed
at best. But don’t let your business get too caught up in the criticism — these
times of noncompliance are likely just bumps in the road as China evolves into
a major player on the world economic stage.

Making minor adaptations to your home-country business plan won’t usually
get you too far in China. Getting your plan right for China may take a lot more
time and effort than you think. This chapter isn’t about how to write a busi-
ness plan. Instead, it’s about how to adjust your planning process and expec-
tations for China.
To find out how to write a business plan, check out Business Plans Kit For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Steven D. Peterson, Peter E. Jaret, and Barbara
Findlay Schenck and Business Plans For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Paul Tiffany
and Steven D. Peterson, both published by Wiley.
Setting the Stage
Along with a good business model, the following elements can help your com-
pany succeed in China. Some of them may seem self-evident; however, many
foreign investors forget them by the time they start getting serious about
China — or never knew them at all.
Being in the right state of mind
Avoid having a must-do attitude about China. China isn’t the right place for
many businesses (see Chapter 1); however, some of them don’t find that out
until after they’ve already made the plunge. If you go into your feasibility

study thinking that your company absolutely must be in China, then your
evaluation process is going to be flawed. You’ll almost inevitably conclude
that your company will do well in China. When you’re operating under this
pressure, you may compound the mistake by rushing and cutting corners.
The proper approach is one of cautious optimism. If you think China may have
an opportunity for your company, you should investigate it impartially. If your
original notions of how to do business there look like they may not work, see
whether changing the model works better. Above all else, don’t lose objectivity.
Budgeting enough money
China is an expensive place in which to do business. You’re going to need to
hire good lawyers, accountants, and consultants. Partly because of China’s
bureaucracy, its developing legal system, and the language issues, these pro-
fessionals take longer to do their work. No doubt about it — you’re going to
rack up some serious fees. And don’t think you can send these people home
after the initial documents are done, either. Having good outside professionals
involved on a continuing basis can reduce the very real risks that you have a
rogue, noncompliant, or dysfunctional operation, so keep these people on
payroll (see Chapters 9 and 17 for more on dysfunction and risks).
You also encounter many hidden costs. See the upcoming “Underestimating
costs” section for details.
Garnering strong support 
from headquarters
Your company’s CEO and board should be fully supportive of the China activ-
ities. Beyond that, headquarters should have people responsible for liaising
with, supporting, and keeping their fingers on the pulse of the China opera-
tions. These people should frequently visit China.
Your company also needs to be committed to China for the long haul, which
usually requires the full support of the CEO as well as the board of directors.
The Chinese judge your company’s commitment by your senior management’s
participation in the China business planning and execution. With a CEO-led
market entry, you can show the Chinese officials and business contacts that
your company is committed to the China market. Some of the biggest success
stories in China today can be attributed to the direct involvement of CEOs.
The China team needs dedicated resources, a sufficient amount of patient
capital, and access to decision makers. Therefore, without the full support of
your company leadership, the people responsible for executing the plan may
not be able to live up to their end of the deals with the Chinese.
56
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

Too often, board members don’t really understand the China market and as a
result have trouble making informed decisions. Therefore, educating the
board continually is important. Some forward-looking companies even hold
occasional board meetings in China in an effort to provide a setting for mem-
bers to better understand both the opportunities and challenges.
Think about how you can get your company’s board to understand China
better. If you plan a board meeting for China, make sure board members see
the less modern side of China. Consider taking them outside of Beijing or
Shanghai to show them a little bit of rural life so they can better understand
the limitations you’re dealing with.
Designating the China manager — 
the earlier, the better
Identify your in-country manager early. His or her involvement in the planning
from the beginning can help tremendously. (See Chapter 9 for a discussion of
finding management and other employees.) Having longtime employees of your
company initially manage the China operation is far better than the alternative.
If you’re going to bring somebody in from the outside, identify this person
soon so he or she can also spend time at headquarters. This orientation is
important because the manager needs to know something about not only your
business but also your corporate culture (see Chapter 9). The China manager
will also be able to develop important relationships with people at home.
Although having the new general manager (GM) involved in planning and
negotiation is great, it’s best not to have him or her leading the efforts.
Remaining unbiased about the prospects in China is tough when your career
is closely tied to going forward with the operation.
Don’t send people to China just because you don’t like them and/or don’t
want them around. This move is often a multimillion-dollar mistake!
Staying flexible
Even the best-researched and thought-out business plan becomes inapplica-
ble after a while — particularly in China, where certain things (especially the
market) change so quickly. Be ready to use your plan as a guide, but don’t be
afraid to reevaluate it if circumstances change. Get your top management and
board to understand that the plan shouldn’t be set in stone.
57
Chapter 4: Planning for Success in China

Deciding What You Want (and Need)
When doing any business plan, you need to address a lot of questions. The
following six considerations are part of any proper plan. However, you need
to be aware of some important China twists in order to keep it realistic.
You obviously need to know what business you’re going to do in China.
However, you should think a little bit deeper than that. What are your busi-
ness goals? As you research, consider whether they’re realistic.
Where to locate
One of the first questions you need to answer is location. (See Chapter 7 for a
general discussion of China’s regions.) Your company’s location is vital to its
ability to find qualified office staff. You don’t necessarily have to be in a top-
tier city (for instance, Beijing or Shanghai) to tap into a solid talent pool. Many
second- and third-tier cities (such as Hangzhou and Chongqing) have good
worker bases. If you’re going to be manufacturing in China, be careful not to
fall into the trap of focusing on incentives. Being near suppliers, customers,
and reliable utilities is more important. See Chapter 13 for more information
on factory site selection.
The governments in large, first-tier cities are generally more transparent and
reliable. However, unless you’re a major investor, they’re unlikely to guide
you through the various approval processes. Cities that are hungrier for
investment may be more willing to help you through the red tape, but the
potential for bad surprises is greater.

The CEO support of Hammerin’ Hank
Hank Greenberg, the former CEO of American
International Group (AIG), provides an excellent
example of a successful CEO-led China effort.
AIG was actually founded in China in 1919. The
business thrived until the foreign capitalists
were forced to leave in 1949. Soon after Richard
Nixon’s historic 1972 visit to China, Greenberg
had a vision of reopening AIG there. He made
his first trip to the Middle Kingdom in 1975, and
by 1980, AIG had one of the first foreign repre-
sentative offices in China. Greenberg continued
to lead AIG’s China strategy for many years,
making dozens of trips to Beijing and Shanghai.
During these trips, he cultivated close relation-
ships with Chinese leaders. Greenberg’s
involvement has paid off for AIG in many ways,
including in 1992 when it received the first insur-
ance license issued to a foreign company in
China. In part due to having such an actively-
involved CEO, AIG was able to get a head start
on its competitors.

Staffing and worker requirements
Be a little aggressive in your assumptions about the number of office staff
you need. As you can read in Chapter 9, Chinese employees have certain
strengths and weaknesses compared to their Western counterparts. In gen-
eral, you may need a slightly greater number of workers in China than you
would in the West. Most Chinese workers aren’t as good about wearing multi-
ple hats as Westerners are, so you may need to have a bit more staff.
We can name two other caveats about staff planning. Figuring out what the
appropriate wages are is really difficult. In many of China’s booming cities,
wages for well-qualified office workers are inflating rapidly. When forecasting
your financials, be a bit aggressive on the wage and wage inflation rate.
Another issue is that office staff turnover is very high — especially in hot
markets. Plan for significantly greater turnover than you’d expect in the West.
One of the big misconceptions that companies have about China is that the
factory labor saving is substantial. In many cases, your per-unit labor costs
will be about the same as they are in the West. Yes, Chinese wages are much
lower than in the West; however, most products don’t have that high of a
labor component, anyway. In addition, Chinese laborers aren’t usually as pro-
ductive as Western workers. You therefore need more workers for the same
task than in the West. See Chapter 13 for more on factory labor.
If you’re wondering whether it’s a myth that you’re able to produce in China
for less, it isn’t. In Chapter 13, we explain that the cost savings in China are
lower utility and input costs, as well as efficiencies gained by using newer
manufacturing models.
Building up: Whether to walk or run
Your company can get its feet wet by setting up an office in China just to do
some sourcing (see Chapter 12). Maybe your goal is to manufacture in China
for your U.S. customers today and sell in China tomorrow. Or perhaps you’re
going right after the Chinese consumer with your own sales network (see
Chapter 14).
The slower you build up in China, the less costly your mistakes (which you’ll
inevitably make) will be. You’re also less likely to leak proprietary intellectual
property (see Chapter 17). On the other hand, regardless of whether you leak
IP, you’re likely to see the competition develop quickly. Part III of this book
can talk you through the major factors in this decision.

Chapter 4: Planning for Success in China

How to sell in China
If you’re looking to sell consumer products in China, be aware that distribu-
tion is very difficult. As we discuss in Chapter 14 on selling in China, third-
party distribution isn’t usually a good long-term plan. Doing a joint venture
with a Chinese company has drawbacks, too. Usually, for long-term success,
you have to build a sales force on your own.
After you figure out how you want to distribute, you have to decide whether
to go into multiple markets at once (beating out competitors but possibly
making costly mistakes) or start with one market and then scale (mistakes
will be cheaper, but competitors can beat you to the new markets). One thing
is certain: If you don’t have your distribution in place before you start selling,
you’re destined to fail.
Perhaps you’re thinking of selling services in China. In that case, you have to
be ready to educate customers on your offering. If you’re going to sell to busi-
nesses, you may have to deal with both state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
which make purchasing decisions by committee, and privately owned
Chinese companies, in which the owner decides all.
How to maintain competitive advantages
As we discuss in Chapter 2, after you taste some success in China, you
should expect competition to come at you from all sides. You have to think
long and hard about how you’ll maintain your competitive position. You
should be prepared for a scenario in which the competition is able to quickly
commoditize your early offerings. Some ways to develop and protect compet-
itive advantages include
 Building your brand (see Chapter 14)
 Protecting intellectual property (see Chapter 17)
 Doing your own distribution (see Chapter 14)
How to finance the venture
Chapter 10 is a must-read for anybody thinking of setting up an office in China.
China’s currency, the RMB, isn’t fully convertible. In other words, getting
money into China is easier than getting it out. Consider using shareholder
loans, intellectual property licenses, and consulting agreements to get money
out of China (in addition to paying dividends when permitted to by law).

Doing Your Homework
Hands-down, the best way to begin to understand China is to spend serious
time on the ground there. This idea is a test of your company’s patience and
commitment. Is it willing to send people to China without very clear agendas?
Ideally, at least one person can go to China several times for a few weeks at a
time.
Of course, you need to do plenty of research before you step foot on China’s
shore. This section tells you a bit about the research process and how people
and published resources can help you find what you need.
Continuing research as 
you develop your plan
Planning and research are iterative processes. In other words, you come up
with a plan. You research it and find out what the issues are. Then you go
back to the drawing board to adjust your plan. You then research the revised
plan, and so on and so forth. Going through the process once or twice would
be nice, but that’s unrealistic. You encounter so many moving parts and sur-
prises when setting up in China. Being able to accept a lengthy iterative
process without becoming frustrated is important.
Be realistic about your company’s resources and commitment. If your com-
pany can’t make the full plunge, you can pursue China opportunities in alter-
native ways. Assuming you want to move forward, start with your company’s
goal or idea (for instance, you want to manufacture widgets in China for
export to Europe).
After you have your basic idea, look into Chinese law. As we discuss in Chap-
ter 7, a host of legal barriers take place in various industries. Sometimes, for-
eigners are completely prohibited from doing certain businesses; other times,
there’s a requirement to form a joint venture (JV) with a Chinese company.
If you’re allowed to have a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE), then think
strategically about whether you want a WFOE or a JV. (Chapter 7 covers the
tradeoffs of JVs; Chapter 14 discusses using a JV to sell in China.) If you’re not
able to have a WFOE, then you need to think about whether you can tweak the
idea so that it’s permissible.
After you have a sense of the broad outlines of your plan, you can move on to
some real, detailed research. Your research will lead you back to your plan
and then to more research.
61
Chapter 4: Planning for Success in China

Networking
Before sending someone over, your company’s employees should scour their
networks for contacts they have in China. Hopefully, the person going to
China can establish contact with these people and set up meetings before
heading over. When that person does head over, he or she should hit trade
shows, interview consultants and other professionals, and attend the myriad
networking events found in major cities (see Chapter 15).
Somebody in this role ideally has good networking skills, knows your business
well, and is able to ask good questions. Chinese language is a plus but not
essential at this point. The overriding goal should be to meet other Western
businesspeople who can give advice and potentially refer your company to
good consultants and other advisors.
Especially in the planning stage, the best people to try to meet are people in
similar businesses or industries. Also, people who are just six months to a
year ahead of you can be excellent resources because their startup lessons
are fresh in their minds.
Unfortunately, this somewhat primitive and costly process is the best way to
approach China. One of the reasons networking is so important in China is
that getting good information is hard. A lot of information is out there on
China, and a lot of people are loudly advertising their advice. Much of the
information and many of the contacts are of low quality. One telltale sign that
someone can’t really help you is that he or she drops a lot of names or brags
about connections. Another sign is constantly telling you how difficult and
mysterious China is.
You may be thinking that you can shortcut some of the on-the-ground
research process by going right to internationally recognized consultants and
the like. That may not be a good idea. Many multinational service firms have
good China operations; however, the quality isn’t nearly as consistent as in
the West. Networking can lead you to the right people. We discuss working
with consultants and other professionals later in “Hiring Consultants,
Lawyers, and Accountants.”
Don’t give too much weight to what any single person advises. You can speak
to two very successful old China hands on the same issue and get radically
different opinions. You want to understand their logic and then see which
view you think works best for you. The more sources you meet, the better.
62
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

Reading up
Numerous Web sites, articles, and books — including this one — can help you
conduct your research from home. The problem is knowing the quality of the
source. We’ve read pieces from Ivy League business professors on some aspects
of doing business in China that we think are completely wrong. Similarly, pieces
written by many consultants make China out to be much more mysterious than
it really is (the reason, of course, is that the writers are trying to sell you their
services). You can’t really know how accurate your information is unless you
confirm it firsthand. Nonetheless, you can improve your chances of getting
good information. When evaluating a source, consider the following:
 Author experience: Author credentials can be very iffy; however, an
author based in China is more likely to be accurate than someone who
just paid a visit to China.
 Where it’s published: Publications focused on China tend to have a
better picture of what’s going on — even when compared to major inter-
national news sources. Academic journals sometimes have useful infor-
mation, but we find that writings from businesspeople and practitioners
usually contain better information and are more practical than academic
writings. The China Business Review (www.chinabusinessreview.com)
is generally very good. Your country’s chamber of commerce in China
may have published a number of good articles and circulars on doing
business in China.
 Date of publication: Information can quickly become outdated. In the
West, three years may not be that ancient, but China changes so quickly
that three years in China can equal a lifetime in the West.
 Tone and objectivity: Popular media frequently tend to be either ebullient
or nightmarish in their portrayals of China; finding well-balanced reports
from these sources is hard. Look for neutral language and balanced cover-
age, and check whether the author uses evidence to support the claims.
 Content: Even when you come across a good piece on doing business in
China, it may not be applicable to the part of China you want to do busi-
ness in. China is very diverse, so look for info that pertains to you.
Reaching out to organizations
Many governments have agencies and affiliates that specialize in helping
smaller companies with research and planning. Here are the major organiza-
tions in Australia, Canada, the U.K., and the U.S.:
 Australia: Australia China Business Council (www.acbc.com.au)
 Canada: Canada China Business Council (www.ccbc.com/home)
63
Chapter 4: Planning for Success in China

 United Kingdom: China-Britain Business Council (www.cbbc.org); 
U.K. government’s trade and investment site (www.ukinvest.gov.uk/
gateway/index.html)
 United States: US-China Business Council (www.uschina.org); U.S.
Government Export Portal (www.export.gov/china); U.S. Commercial
Service China (www.buyusa.gov/china/en); American Chambers of
Commerce (Amcham) in Beijing (www.amcham-china.org.cn) and
Shanghai (www.amcham-shanghai.org/AmchamPortal)
Some of these organizations specialize in providing export services to small
companies. Many are staffed with experienced people who’ve been doing busi-
ness in China for many years. Check with your government’s commercial ser-
vice sector to look for support for your China business. They provide valuable
services, with competitive fees, to companies seeking to enter the Chinese
market. Many countries also have chambers of commerce in China that pro-
vide referrals and valuable information, as well as networking opportunities.
Hiring Consultants, Lawyers, 
and Accountants
Starting to use quality consultants, accountants, lawyers, and other profes-
sionals early in the planning process is a good idea. The following is a list of
some professionals you may want to engage during the planning process:
 IP lawyers: As we discuss in Chapter 17, one of the first things you want
to do is protect your intellectual property in China. That usually means
applying for Chinese patents and trademarks. Also, you should get a
non-compete/non-disclosure agreement drawn up for any discussions
with potential partners.
 Corporate lawyers: Your corporate lawyers advise you on structuring
issues. Knowing from the beginning how the laws will affect where and
how you set up your companies for the China venture is essential. You
may choose to use the same firm that does your IP work.
 Tax consultants: Some law firms have in-house tax experts who can help
in the structuring advisory stage. If your law firm doesn’t, consult some-
body in this field as you plan the structure. You want to make sure that
the structure your lawyers propose works from a tax perspective.
 Market consultants: If you’re going to be selling in China, you would do
well to have consultants research the potential markets for your product
or service.
 Site selection consultants: If your company is going to manufacture, you
want to start looking at sites right off the bat, because your location can
affect your tax status, which may affect your corporate structure. See
Chapter 13 for more on picking site-selection consultants.
64
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

The challenge is that you first have to find good professionals. You can’t
always rely on multinational service providers’ brands in China, so you need
to get referrals from people you trust. Of course, when you do get a referral,
don’t blindly follow it. Interview the candidate thoroughly. Following in this
section are factors to consider when evaluating professionals.
Doing more than asking questions is hard when evaluating potential profes-
sional service providers. Even bad professionals have good answers to some
of these questions. So listen to your gut when hearing their responses. If you
think something is off, trust the feeling. Interviewing the professionals in
person is best so you can read them better. Plus, you may get a glimpse of
their operation.
Many of the professionals will actually be working in teams. You want to
understand these answers as they apply to the teams, not just the individual
you’re speaking with.
China (and Western) experience
Usually, the best teams have a good mixture of experience in China and the
West. Those with experience in the West should understand your expecta-
tions well. They’re also likely to be better practitioners than the people
who’ve spent most of their careers in Asia. The people heavy on China expe-
rience are just as vital because China has certain unique elements that the
team needs to be attuned to.
Teamwork
If you’ll indeed be hiring a team from a given service provider, meet with the
entire team during the evaluation and observe them in the meeting. If only
the leader seems to be doing the talking, you may want to assume that you
have less of a team than an individual. Although the other team members will
no doubt perform work, they may not have much influence on the most
important strategic advice. In that case, you’re placing a bigger bet on the
team leader. It’s not time to run for the exits, but be aware.
Information flows
Because China changes so quickly and radically, your professionals must be
able to keep pace. You should develop a line of questioning about how they
keep current on developments, share information within the firm, and pass
information along to clients.
65
Chapter 4: Planning for Success in China

The initial responses to your questions aren’t likely to reveal much — every-
body will say that he or she gets regular updates from various sources and
disseminates information via e-mail and meetings. You should ask a lot of
follow-up questions based on the professionals’ answers. You’re trying to
figure out how effective their systems truly are — the communication does
no good if nobody reads the e-mails they send out.
To better understand why communication and information sharing within a
firm in China is such an issue, see Chapter 9. In China, communication can
easily break down among coworkers — in an information intensive business,
the clients can get hurt badly.
Specific experience
Industry experience may or may not be important, depending on the type of
service and what your business is. For example, if you want to manufacturer
screwdrivers, it’s probably not that important for your lawyers or accoun-
tants to have worked with tool manufacturers before. On the other hand, if
you’re getting into an area with a lot of regulation or an area that’s new in
China, such as media, having even one or two similar projects under the
provider’s belt can be a big help. Industry experience is most important in
selecting market and strategy consultants.
With lawyers, the important part of their experience is usually with similar
business structures rather than businesses. Manufacturing wholly foreign-
owned enterprises (WFOEs) are extremely common, so your attorney likely
has ample experience in this area. The qualifications get trickier when you’re
in the joint venture (JV) realm, though. If you already have a sense of any 
special features you want in a JV — especially in the control and corporate
governance areas — an attorney experienced with similar features can be a
big help. If you’re at the point where you don’t know what kinds of features
you want or are available, ask the attorney to describe what he or she has
done before to help clients with similar goals.
66
Part I: Building Your Foundation 
Too much information
Professionals need more than mass e-mails to
stay up-to-date on important issues in China.
One foreign lawyer in China groused about the
daily e-mails she receives on new laws, regula-
tions, and circulars. To begin with, she usually
has dozens of e-mails to sift through each morn-
ing. The legal update e-mails are usually several
pages of text, discussing numerous items.
Unfortunately, important legal developments
are often buried among developments in areas
such as the sale of leopard bones, corpse han-
dling, and mooncake standards. She confesses
to not always reading the updates.

When evaluating accountants’ experience, make sure they have a good deal of
experience working with your home accounting standards. Also, they should
have done a number of engagements with businesses that have similar work
processes, such as inventory-management processes. Above all, though, they
should have ample experience working with foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs).
If the people you’re evaluating tell you little more than “China is very different
from the West,” watch out. China is different, but some professionals make a
good living by convincing clients that China is so complicated that the clients
can’t possibly take a breath of air without the professional’s help (although
having the help of an air filter when taking breaths in China may not be a bad
idea). You’re sure to need help in certain areas but not in all aspects. Not only
are the professionals who work hard to shroud China in mystery hard-sellers,
but very often, they have little substance to offer. If you engage someone like
this, you’ll often find yourself on the receiving end of the excuse “you don’t
understand China” because the professional messed something up.
Being Aware of Common 
Planning Mistakes
Several mistakes are common to first-time investors in China. Try to keep this
section in mind during your planning. When you’ve almost finished your plan,
you may want to reread this section to see whether you’ve possibly commit-
ted one or more of these errors.
Overestimating revenue
Over-optimism is the biggest mistake that foreign investors make when plan-
ning for China. Assumptions tend to be a bit optimistic because consultants
and soon-to-be China managers have an interest in selling the project. Some
companies looking to sell to China are naïve enough to think that China is a
market of 1.3 billion consumers. Hopefully, your company understands that
only a small percentage of Chinese people have disposable income. Companies
also commonly overestimate sales because they don’t fully account for distrib-
ution difficulties, competitive onslaught, and consumers’ purchasing power.
Underestimating costs
Companies tend to experience higher operating costs than they expect. For
one, China is a more expensive place to do business than you’re used to.
Another issue is that China has a number of hidden costs, such as employee
turnover, utility shortages, and supply bottlenecks.
67
Chapter 4: Planning for Success in China

Another reason companies underestimate costs is that they assume timelines
for getting off the ground that aren’t realistic. If you’re manufacturing in
China, for instance, expect that your per-unit costs will be the same as in the
West for your first two or three years of operations.
Rushing the process
If you feel beholden to a timeline, you’re bound to make mistakes. “Good
things come to those who wait” is doubly true in China. Don’t look for short-
cuts and ways to cut corners. Common examples of such shortcuts include
doing a joint venture when you have reservations about the partner just
because you want to get things moving. It’s also common to screw up in nego-
tiations because your team has flown thousands of miles for a negotiation
and there’s pressure to make the trip seem worthwhile. When something
comes up in the meetings, your team may gloss over it, deciding that it can
be worked out later, in order to move closer to signing. Build plenty of extra
time into your schedule.
Not accounting for the X-factor
In a literal sense, you can’t plan for the unknowable. But you should know
that the unknowable will happen to your company and that you normally
won’t be pleased. You shouldn’t operate the company so close to the bone
that it can’t withstand the X-factor. Moreover, you should have contingency
plans in place for various emergencies.
Throughout the book, you can read about a number of companies that got hit
by the X-factor in one form or another. Don’t take their stories too much to
heart, though, or you’ll find yourself preparing to fight the previous war.
However, one event that should be in your contingency plans is a major health
epidemic, such as SARS or the bird flu. Have a plan in place in case of a sudden
outbreak where nobody shows up to work. You may also want to educate your
workers on public health issues and push them to get flu vaccines yearly.
Mistaking Chinese language for China
Short-sighted firms believe that if they hire someone with Chinese language
skills back at headquarters, he or she will be the right fit to work with the
China business — either from headquarters or in China. Too often, Western
companies think that language skills are the key to unlocking the Chinese
market. Unfortunately, this method isn’t the way to go about it. Doing busi-
ness in China involves more than speaking Chinese.
68
Part I: Building Your Foundation 

Hire people for their business skills. Interpreters and translators (see Chap-
ter 2) can help your team deal with any language issues.
Losing sight of what you know
Throughout all phases of doing business in China, you should remember that
you already know a lot about your own business. Language barriers,
overzealous consultants, job applicants, and widely reported incidents of
Western companies meeting with business disaster can easily intimidate you
into thinking that you don’t know what you’re doing in China.
You know a lot more than you may realize. Good business practices are good
business practices. They can be transferred. Odds are that many aspects of
your business model can be transferred, too, but don’t take this advice as a
license to be stubborn or arrogant. You’re going to need to be flexible in
some areas. We’re just trying to give you some backbone to stand up to the
(often self-interested) people who’re inevitably going to try to convince you
that you don’t know what you’re doing.
As a general rule, your internal management practices — particularly your
corporate culture — are mostly applicable in China (see Chapter 9). If you’re
going to make adjustments, they’re most likely going to be made to marketing
and distribution models.
Your respect for ethics and legal compliance is 100 percent applicable in
China. Never compromise these principles in the belief that you have to play
by special rules in China. Some of your Chinese competitors may play by dif-
ferent rules, but an FIE should never do so. Make sure part of the culture you
instill reflects your company’s ethical practices. See Chapter 17 for safeguard-
ing against some compliance-related risks.
69
Chapter 4: Planning for Success in China
We thought they wanted to work
One company was in negotiations to purchase a
Chinese-owned company. The Chinese com-
pany’s payroll was a bit bloated. Part of the
negotiations dealt with whether the buyers
could lay off some employees. The sellers
agreed to layoffs, provided that the buyers 
paid severance and guaranteed the pension
obligations to those workers. This provision
seemed fair enough, and the sale of the com-
pany went through. Shortly after the workers
found out that some workers were going to be
let go with severance and a guaranteed pen-
sion, the remaining workers immediately went
on strike. They wanted to get laid off, too!

Putting Some Eggs in Another Basket
The China plus one strategy, or plus one, is gathering attention in the business
world. Some businesspeople fear that their companies may be overconcen-
trating in China. So instead of putting all your eggs in the China basket, China
plus one says you should consider somewhere to invest in addition to China.
Although China is attractive to many companies around the world, diversify-
ing is always a good risk management tool. It’s especially significant for the
manufacturing sector, where some multinationals have a very high concentra-
tion of investment in China. As a result, many companies are becoming more
cautious about adding any future investment in China. Some big companies
are considering investments elsewhere in Asia, such as Vietnam and Malaysia.
As you may appreciate, some of the multinationals have billions of dollars of
investment in China. Therefore, they have a good reason to be concerned
about their company’s future approach to investment in China. If you’re a
smaller company, you may want to keep China plus one in mind for the future.

Getting the Necessary Documents 
and Vaccines
This section goes through the permissions, paperwork, and other prepara-
tion you need to take care of before you head to China.
Passport
You need a valid passport to travel to China. Go to your government’s Web site
for details on the application process. The process can take up to two months,
but you can generally expedite the process by paying an additional fee.

If you already have a passport, it must be valid for six months prior to the expi-
ration of your visa for a single-entry visa (see the upcoming “Visa” section). For
a double- or multiple-entry visa, you need your passport to be good for at least
nine months before the expiration of your visa. The Chinese embassy or con-
sulate won’t issue you an entry visa if your passport doesn’t meet the require-
ments. The passport also needs to have at least one blank page.
Business invitation to China
As a business visitor, you require a formal, paper invitation from Chinese busi-
ness contacts saying that you’ll be visiting China for business purposes. You
can ask your Chinese host to fax you a letter of invitation. You must include
this letter when you apply for your China business visa at the Chinese
embassy or consulate. Your invitation letter should be from a company or
organization based in China. (For a sample letter, go to www.visarite.
com/bizinvitation.htm.)
Alternatively, if you don’t have contacts in China yet, you can submit a busi-
ness letter addressed to the Consulate General with your visa application.
(Visit www.visarite.com/bizletter.htm for a sample.)
On official company letterhead, the invitation should include the following:
 The visitor’s name and position
 The company name(s)
 The dates and purpose of the trip
 A statement that your company is covering expenses
Visa
Most people entering China for business purposes need business (F) visas.
Business visas are valid for up to six months, but they allow the holder to
stay in the country for only up to 30 days. Business visas are available in
single-, double-, and multiple-entry options. To be sure you get the right visa,
check with your travel agent.
China has two Special Administrative Regions (SARs): Hong Kong and Macao.
These two regions have separate and different visa and entry requirements.
Your Chinese visa is not valid for entry into Hong Kong and Macao. For many
travelers, however, visits to Hong Kong and Macao don’t require visas. Hong
Kong and Macau allow visitors from certain countries to visit for short peri-
ods of time without a visa. Check (www.immd.gov.hk/ehtml/hkvisas_
4.htm) for Hong Kong requirements and (www.gov.mo/egi/Portal/rkw/

public/view/showcomp.jsp?id=InfoShowTemp&docid=c373e909dd9
7940b8f7ad00d226ced8b) for Macau requirements.
If you plan to spend considerable time (90 days or more for some visitors) in
China, you may be subject to personal income tax. Check with your tax advi-
sor back home to find out the maximum number of days you’re allowed to
travel to China without incurring any tax liability. (It varies by country and
depends whether your country has a tax treaty with China.)
Paying attention to processing time
Check with your travel agent and/or nearest Chinese consulate to determine
what the local processing time will likely be. Generally, you need up to seven
days to obtain a visa in person at a Chinese embassy or consulate. Make sure
you allow additional time over the holidays. The Chinese consulates are often
closed for Chinese national holidays — usually in January or February, May,
and October. This is in addition to observing the holidays of the host country.
You can get your visa from the Chinese embassy or consulate more quickly if
you’re willing to pay a higher price. Check with the Chinese embassy or con-
sulate to determine your best option. In the U.S., single-entry visas start at
US$50. A multiple-entry visa that’s good for 12 months and lets you stay for
60 to 90 days is US$180.
You may want to consider using a passport or visa express service company.
For a modest additional fee for handling and shipping, you can avoid the
hassle of getting your Chinese visa. It saves you time, lets you avoid long
lines, and gets the job done right the first time.
Applying for a visa
You can get your visa from the Chinese consulate or Chinese embassy in your
local area. Visas are also available via a travel agent or visa service. To obtain
a single-entry, double-entry, or multiple-entry business visa for a 6-month or
12- to 24-month period, you need
 An application form
 One passport-sized photo
 A formal letter of invitation from your Chinese business contact (or a
letter to your consulate — see the earlier section on letters of invitation)
The single-entry visa is valid for travel to China for 90 days from the date of
issue; in other words, you need to begin your travel within 90 days of getting
your visa.

If you believe you’ll be headed to China more than once over the coming
months or year, consider getting a multiple-entry visa. That way, you don’t
have to get a single-entry visa every time you go there. The added costs of a
multiple-entry visa may be worth avoiding the hassle of getting a new visa for
every trip you make.
See the earlier “Passport” section for info on passport requirements.
Considering your visa when you’re in China
You can usually extend or even change your visa when you’re in China. To do
so, go to the Public Security Bureau. The visas that you obtain or extend in
China are usually more flexible than the ones you can get in your home coun-
try. Work with a local travel agent or get help at the hotel where you’re stay-
ing to get everything done correctly.
Make sure you leave China the day before your visa expires — not on the day
it expires. Staying in China beyond the expiration date of your visa earns you
monetary penalties of 300 RMB a day.
Vaccines and health requirements
The Chinese authorities don’t require vaccines for travel to China, but you
should consult your doctor and relevant government agencies in your home
country to determine what vaccinations may be appropriate for you. At least
make sure your tetanus and hepatitis A vaccines are up-to-date.
Plan to get inoculated within a sufficient amount of time to allow the vaccine
to take effect. Check with your doctor to be sure to get everything in order
before your trip, and keep your vaccination records in a safe place so you
know when to update them in the future.
If you’re not sure what vaccinations are recommended for traveling to China,
you can check sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(www.cdc.gov/travel/eastasia.htm).
Health may be a concern as your company decides whom to send overseas.
China won’t issue visas to people with the following conditions:
 Certain mental disorders
 Contagious tuberculosis
 AIDS
 Venereal diseases
 Similar infectious diseases

Making Flight and Hotel Arrangements
Getting to and from China is a lot easier than most people think. Because
China has such a large land mass, you can choose from multiple points of
entry. Not only can you fly internationally on many foreign airlines or Chinese
airlines, but you can also take advantage of the incredible number of domes-
tic flights to and from Hong Kong, which serves as a gateway to the rest of
China. (For info on domestic flights within China, see “Taking flight in the
Middle Kingdom,” later in this chapter.)
In a booming travel market like China, full airline cabins and overbooked
flights can be a problem. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you make
your flight arrangements about a month in advance of your departure date.
Airport fees and fuel surcharges apply. The airport tax for international trav-
elers into China is 90 RMB, and it’s included in the ticket price.
If you’re coming from North America, you’ll arrive in China the day after your
departure date because you’ll cross the International Date Line. Therefore,
you need to build this change into your busy schedule. Many businesspeople
who travel to China arrive on a Sunday to allow time to get over jet lag. If
your schedule allows, consider departing for China on Saturday.
Flying directly into mainland China
The most popular way to get to China is a direct nonstop flight from a major
international city. Almost every such city in the world has a direct flight to
China these days, saving travelers both time and hassle. This section dis-
cusses the airports in the most common Chinese destinations for business
travelers: Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
Many airlines — including United Airlines, Air Canada, Northwest, Air China,
China Eastern, and China Southern — fly directly to China from North America.
In the U.S., flights depart from Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Chicago,
and Washington, D.C., and the list continues to grow. If you’re departing from
Canada, you can fly nonstop to Beijing from Vancouver or to Shanghai from
Toronto.
From Europe, you can travel from major cities such as Amsterdam, Frankfurt,
Copenhagen, London, Milan, Paris, and Zurich. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Air
China, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Lufthansa, British Airways, Virgin, Alitalia,
Air France, China Eastern, and Swiss Air all fly nonstop to China.
77
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China

Beijing
Beijing, in the northern part of the country, is one of the most popular entry
points in China. The Beijing Capital International Airport is conveniently
located 25.35 kilometers (15 miles) from the center of the city. The airport
has two terminals servicing 66 domestic and foreign airline companies.
From the airport, you can take a bus (60 minutes) for 16 RMB on four differ-
ent routes in the city. Taxis take 40 to 60 minutes and are the preferred way to
travel. The cost by taxi is 60 to 120 RMB, depending on the destination and
the traffic.
Shanghai
A city of 18 million people, Shanghai is a popular gateway to China for foreign
businesspeople. Its Pudong International Airport has two terminals.
From Pudong International, you can take a bus (five routes), taxi, or the Maglev
train for the 19-mile ride into Shanghai. Depending on traffic and where you’re
staying, a taxi ride should take 25 minutes to an hour and cost 100 to 150 RMB.
Taking the Maglev is definitely the most exciting option. This train, which
runs on magnetic levitation, takes a mere 8 minutes and goes at speeds up to
430 kilometers per hour (267 miles per hour). Beware that the Maglev stop in
Shanghai is several miles out of the way and requires a taxi ride or a subway
transfer to your final destination. A number of reports say that taxi drivers at
the Maglev station often require customers to pay fares substantially higher
than the meter rates. Such behavior is generally isolated to pickups from the
Maglev station and otherwise very rarely occurs in Shanghai.
Guangzhou
The city of Guangzhou (population 10 million) is located in the south of
China. Guangzhou is a busy commercial center for visiting businesspeople in
China. The Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport opened in late 2004, and
78
Part II: Starting Up in China 
Beijing, a growing gateway to the East
Beijing made many improvements to its infra-
structure in the run-up to the 2008 Olympics, and
the government there is adding more and more
international air routes that connect to China’s
bustling cities. This allows more foreign airlines
and domestic carriers to serve additional
Chinese cities that are growing in popularity,
such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hangzhou. Check
with your travel agent for a direct flight to the
city you’re traveling to. If one isn’t available, you
can travel to Beijing (or the nearest large city)
and take a connecting domestic flight to your
final destination.

the second phase of construction is scheduled to finish in 2009. You can grab
a taxi for the 28-kilometer (17.4-mile) ride into the city.
Guangzhou has an enormous international trade fair (among other fairs) each
October and April. Hotels fill up fast for the trade fair, so plan accordingly.
Flying into Hong Kong first
An option for many people is to fly to Hong Kong and take other transporta-
tion to the mainland. The Hong Kong International Airport — which is actu-
ally on an island — is one of the best, most interesting airports in the world.
While at the airport, you can take advantage of its free Internet access and
wide range of shopping and dining outlets. The flight procedures are the
same as at other international destinations — go through quarantine, cus-
toms, and then to baggage claim (check out “Navigating the Airport after 
You Land,” coming up).
You have many choices of flights from Hong Kong to most of the popular 
destinations on the mainland (though flying directly into China is generally
cheaper). Or you can take the Airport Express train for a maximum of HK$100
(US$12) (price depends on location), use one of six bus routes into the city,
or use a taxi to get to and from the airport. If you get a taxi, get a red one —
they specifically serve the urban area.
Another option is to travel from Hong Kong to the Chinese city of Shenzhen
by one of the high-speed ferry companies that call at the Hong Kong
International Airport. The ferry is a convenient way to get to southern China
if you’re doing business there.
And if you prefer to travel by train, you can travel from Hong Kong via the
Kowloon Canton Railway (KCR) to Lo Wu in southern China. From Lo Wu, you
walk across the border into the mainland into Shenzhen. This option is rela-
tively easy, fast, and low-cost. You can also reach other southern Chinese
cities using the railway.
For more information on the Kowloon Canton Railway route system and tick-
eting, go to www.kcrc.com. Booking a ticket directly with the Kowloon
Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) is easy by calling + 852 2947 7888.
Finding a good hotel
You can stay in one of many quality hotels in China. The hotels range from
luxury five-star hotel chains that you’d find at home to three-star economy
hotels. Try to select a hotel that’s near your appointments while in China.
79
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China

Most international hotel chains are well represented in China’s major cities,
and many good Asian regional hotel chains operate in China. One of the best
represented foreign luxury hotel brands in China is Shangri-La. Some
Chinese-owned hotels can be an option as well. Generally, the Chinese-owned
hotels are not comparable to foreign hotels of the same star rating, but your
travel agent can find you a suitable place to stay.
Business centers are common in many hotels in China’s major cities but less
so in Chinese-owned hotels. Check with the hotel ahead of time to confirm
that you’ll have access to a fax, express mail, broadband Internet, and a meet-
ing room if you need one. International calling is also available.
When checking into a Chinese hotel, you need to present your passport as
identification. Use the hotel’s safety deposit box, or if you’re lucky enough, an
in-room safe, to store your valuables and passport. When checking out of the
hotel, service fees and possibly a construction fee for the city that you’re vis-
iting will also be on your bill.
Navigating the Airport after You Land
Chinese airports tend to be very crowded. They can be confusing to foreign
travelers, even though most signs are written in both English and Chinese.
Some newer Chinese airports are very large, so pay attention to where you’re
going and leave yourself adequate time to get to and from your gate.
Boarding and exiting a plane in China can be quite an experience. Don’t be
surprised if you see people pushing their way through a crowd of people. The
best advice is to just go with the flow. Note that airline personnel don’t call
seating by rows or sections as they do in the United States. People just start
boarding the plane all at once.
In this section, we explain what you have to take care of after you get off the
plane.
Health and quarantine
You need to complete a health declaration form upon arrival in China. You
get this form on the plane, and the Chinese collect this document from you.
Under the law, China reserves the right to health inspections on passengers
who arrive or depart. Foreigners suffering from certain types of mental or
infectious diseases aren’t allowed to enter China. And like most other coun-
tries, China doesn’t allow certain products, such as fruit, that may cause a
80
Part II: Starting Up in China 

health risk in China. Check with your local Chinese embassy or consulate if
you have any specific questions.
Immigration
To pass through immigration, you need to complete the right paperwork,
including an entry card for foreign visitors, which provides basic arrival infor-
mation. You receive the entry card on your flight to China. As you enter
China, officials inspect this entry card and your other documents and do the
usual stamp on your passport. Given the increased security around the
world, Chinese authorities may interview visitors upon arrival in China.
Baggage claim
After health and quarantine and immigration, head to the baggage claim. In
the unlikely event that your luggage goes missing, find the airline ticket agent
and show him or her your baggage receipt. Tell the agent the name of the
hotel where you’re staying, and the agent can arrange for your luggage to be
sent there.
Customs
You need to complete a customs form before arriving. If you have nothing to
declare, just follow the green lane and pass right through customs. If you do
have to declare something, you need to go through the red channel and deal
with the customs officials. You’re expected to pay duty on any items in
excess of the amounts allowed to be brought into China. Here’s what you’re
allowed duty-free:
 Alcohol and tobacco: Four hundred cigarettes, 100 hundred cigars, and
two bottles of liquor (up to 1.5 liters for each bottle)
 Electronics: A laptop, camera, video camera, and tape recorder for 
personal use
 Money: Foreign currency up to US$5,000
 Precious metals: Gold and silver up to 50 grams
Any content — including film, picture, and video — that’s detrimental to
China is not allowed to be brought into the country, so don’t bring anything
into China that may be considered offensive.
81
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China

When you leave China, you can take 6,000 RMB in cash with you. Of course,
you can use Chinese money only inside the country. It’s not convertible out-
side of China except for in Hong Kong. China also has some strict laws about
the exportation of cultural relics. Make sure you have customs approval to
export any antiques before leaving China. Customs officials attach a small red
seal to antiques that can be legally taken out of China.
Getting from the airport to your hotel
After you get your luggage, your next destination is the hotel. Some high-end
hotels can offer you car service. Make such arrangements in advance. Most
foreign businesspeople go to the taxi stand at the airport and head to their
next destination.
At the airport, you often see private cars offering rides to visitors. Just ignore
them — going by a metered taxi is cheaper and safer.
Around and About: Traveling 
within China
Traveling within the vast country of China can be a little trickier than getting
to China. China’s transportation infrastructure is being built at a frantic pace.
New airports, high-speed trains, and new expressways are always popping
up. (China had no expressways until the late 1980s.) Sometimes your travels
in China go really well — and sometimes they don’t.
Although getting around China by yourself is possible, the language barrier
makes it somewhat difficult. Outside of the major cities, English isn’t very
common. Even within major cities, don’t expect taxi drivers to understand
English.
Many visitors to China rely on their local Chinese business contacts to help
them get around. Using an interpreter can also help you with travel arrange-
ments. (For more information on using an interpreter, go to Chapter 2.) After
you’ve traveled to China a few times and have experienced the transporta-
tion systems, getting around shouldn’t be too much of a problem.
For information on paying for transportation, see the upcoming sections
titled “Considering a travel card” and “Finding money.”
82
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Taking flight in the Middle Kingdom
China’s domestic airlines serve approximately 80 Chinese cities. Air China
alone has over 240 domestic routes, and more routes and services are being
added. China’s local airlines have purchased a newer fleet of European- and
American-built airplanes. Generally, foreign business visitors get around
China pretty easily using the local Chinese air carriers. However, the quality
of some domestic airports isn’t as high as that of the international ones.
The airport tax is 50 RMB for domestic flights. The domestic flight fee is labeled
as an “Airport Construction Fee” and is included in the sale of all plane tickets.
Taxiing
Taxis are the best way to get around China’s cities without the hassle of 
packing yourself in amongst subway or bus commuters. The cabs are usually
reasonably clean and of varying comfort, and tipping isn’t expected. Some
taxis are air conditioned and others are not. But when you really need one,
you take what you can get!
Taxis technically aren’t allowed to stop except in designated areas, but most
taxis rarely follow the rules. Hotels and large commercial buildings generally
have a taxi stand where people wait in line for the next available taxi. Outside
83
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China
A little help from Chinese travel agents
For planning travel within China, including
making hotel reservations, using a reliable
travel agent that’s based in China is best. Intra-
China airfares are usually lower when pur-
chased in China, and travel agents based
outside of China often use China-based travel
agencies to book hotels and tours in China,
anyway.
Many travel agents are in China, but one of the
biggest is China International Travel Service
(www.cits.net). If you have somebody in
China who can make payment and take delivery
of air tickets or hotel vouchers, you can use the
Chinese travel portals eLong (www.elong.
net) or Ctrip (english.ctrip.com). Both
offer English sites. For arranging business and
higher-end personal services in Shanghai and
other major cities, Black Card Life (www.
blackcardlife.com) is a good bet.

such common places, you hail a taxi by holding your arm outstretched and
parallel to the ground. Needless to say, competition for taxis is common in
the large cities in China.
Here are some points to remember about taxi travel:
 Many taxi drivers in major cities don’t originally hail from those cities,
so they may not know their way around well. Unfortunately, they don’t
always tell you this before driving! Always have a mobile phone with you
in case the driver gets lost.
 Make sure to have your destination written in Chinese for your driver, or
at least have a printed copy of the name and address of the hotel or
business you’re visiting.
 Opt for one of the larger taxi fleets, which generally have better service.
In Shanghai, the larger taxi companies go by colors: yellow, turquoise,
light green, white, and blue.
 Use only taxis that have meters.
 The taxis seem to disappear in rain or extreme heat. Picking up a taxi at
the hotel is an easy method — the hotel doorman can tell the driver
where you need to go.
 Don’t be surprised when you find a lot of traffic and congestion in most
Chinese cities. You need to plan your time carefully to make sure you
arrive at your appointments on time.
 Taxis don’t accept credit cards, so you have to pay in cash or with your
transportation card (see “Considering a travel card,” later in this chapter).
 Always get a receipt from the driver. Getting a receipt is especially useful
if you happen to forget your belongings in a taxi.
Taking the subways
For the first-time visitor or the infrequent visitor to China, taking on the busy
subway system probably isn’t a good idea. But if you’re game, using the
subway, or Metro, can be a great, cheap way to get around and explore. Many
of the large Chinese cities have existing subways that continue to expand, and
about a dozen other cities are planning or building new subways. For example,
Shanghai’s subway can whisk you from the financial district in Pudong to the
Bund in just a few minutes. And the signs are in English, too. However, the
stops aren’t the most convenient for business visitors. Still, you can take the
subway to the closest stop and then take a cab to your final destination,
avoiding the crazy traffic jams that are part of modern daily life in China.
84
Part II: Starting Up in China 

To use the Metro in most cities, you need to purchase a single-journey ticket
or transportation card at the Metro station. Most cards can be refilled at 
both stations and various merchants, such as convenience stores. The fare
for a subway ride depends on your destination, with fares ranging from 3 to 
5 RMB. Be sure to hang onto your card after you get on the train — you need
to put it in the machine in order to exit the station.
You could watch three trains pass by before one has room for you to get on,
so don’t be afraid to push a little bit to get a spot on the train! Some people
may push onto the train before waiting for people to get off. Avoiding sub-
ways around rush hour can save you some of this hassle.
Busing around
Although you don’t see too many foreigners on buses, these vehicles can be a
reliable source of transportation. Beijing alone has more than 700 bus routes.
However, taking buses in China is not for the fainthearted. Even the locals
can get confused about which buses go where. Still, the newer, climate-
controlled busses are worth a try if you’re adventurous.
The bus fare in Beijing depends on your destination, as well as the vehicle
itself (the nicer the bus, the more expensive the ride). For an air-conditioned
bus, the trip costs 2 RMB for less than 10 kilometers (6.25 miles) and another
2 RMB per additional 10 kilometers. If you don’t get air-conditioning, the cost
is 1 RMB per 10 kilometers.
When you get on the bus, you don’t pay as you board. Instead, a bus atten-
dant comes to you, asks where you’re going, and tells you the fee. Clearly
writing down your destination to show the attendant is a good idea. After
paying the fare, the attendant usually gives you a receipt. Be sure to pay
attention to the bus stops and ring the bell before yours so you can get out.
In Shanghai, the fare doesn’t depend on distance. Instead, either you touch
your transportation card to the reader by the driver’s seat (see the upcoming
“Considering a travel card” section) or an attendant comes to you after
you’ve boarded to collect the set fare. As in Beijing, prices are slightly more
expensive for air-conditioning.
Riding the rails to and fro
China’s extensive rail system links most of the country. It’s upgrading rapidly
and even includes some high-speed trains, similar to those in Europe and
Japan. Depending on the type of train, riding the rails may or may not be a
good way to travel between cities.
85
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China

You need to purchase tickets in advance, which your hotel should be able to
arrange for you. Ticket prices vary by route and type of train — they’re quite
affordable, though. Most trains have a “soft class,” which is highly recom-
mended over “hard class.”
Avoid taking trains around the week-long holidays (January/February, May,
and October) because the trains are so jammed with people that passengers
stand in hard class for up to 36 hours at a time!
Considering a travel card
In Shanghai, the Shanghai Public Transportation Card (SPTC) gives you easy
access to the buses, Metro, ferries, taxis, and Airport Maglev. You can pur-
chase a card at Metro stations. Besides being a convenient touch card, the
SPTC also allows you to take an overdraft if you run out of money on your
card. Taxis don’t provide receipts when you use the card, because you
receive a receipt when purchasing the card.
Watch out for taxi drivers who give back another card without much money
on it. You may want to mark your card in a way that you can easily identify it,
even when you’re in a dark cab.
The Standard card has a refundable deposit of 30 RMB; other cards can’t be
refunded, but a Mini card has a lower deposit (20 RMB). The cards can be
reloaded in multiples of 10 RMB at deposit stations throughout Shanghai or
in multiples of 50 RMB in many local Metro stations. The balance is noted
every time you scan through an entry/exit at a Metro station.
Hong Kong’s Octopus card is good not only for paying for public transporta-
tion but also for payment at convenience stores, supermarkets, fast-food
restaurants, and more. After purchasing the card at an MTR (Mass Transit
Railway) station, you can refill it at an MTR station or at a merchant that
accepts the Octopus as payment. The most overdraft an Octopus card will
take is HK$35 (US$4.50). An adult Octopus card costs HK$150 (US$19.20).
Beijing has a Yikatong card (formally known as the Beijing Municipal
Administration and Communications Card) that you can use for public trans-
portation. The system was recently expanded and continues to grow. You can
purchase bus, subway, and combined bus/subway cards for a monthly fee.
If you’re in Guangzhou, get a Yang Cheng Tong card for the bus, Metro, taxis,
and ferries. A standard card costs 80 RMB.
Shenzhen’s card — the Shenzhen Transcard — works for the Shenzhen Metro
and buses.
86
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Getting through the Basics of Daily Life
Finding money, staying healthy, and generally getting by in your home coun-
try is usually pretty easy. In China, these basics can be easy, too. In this sec-
tion, we talk about how these fundamentals work in China.
Finding money
For now, cash is king in China. You can find ATMs in all the big cities. Credit
cards aren’t widely used or accepted except at businesses catering to 
foreigners.
China’s currency is called the renminbi (RMB), meaning the people’s money.
Its basic unit is called the yuan. Some people also refer to the yuan as kuai.
Here are the main denominations:
 100 RMB note (currently a red color — older versions are purple)
 50 RMB note (green-blue)
 20 RMB note (brown)
 10 RMB note (blue)
 5 RMB note (brown)
 2 RMB note (green)
 1 RMB note (purple brown) and coin
Other smaller bills and coins, called jiao and fen, are also in circulation.
You should convert your personal foreign currency into China’s local cur-
rency. You can do so at a bank in China, at the airport, or at your hotel.
Generally, you get a better deal at the bank. Look carefully at the rates and
fees to make sure you’re getting a fair deal. If you expect to exchange cur-
rency at the end of your trip, save your exchange receipts. If you don’t have
the receipts, you can’t convert the money back into your original foreign cur-
rency. (For information on avoiding counterfeit money, see “Staying clear of
counterfeits,” near the end of the chapter.)
Using ATMs
The Bank of China (www.bank-of-china.com/en/static/index.html)
is China’s main bank. Bank of China’s ATMs are linked to Plus, Amex, Cirrus,
Maestro, and Diners Club International networks. Bank of China’s ATM net-
work is quite good in most medium and large Chinese cities. The Bank of
87
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China

Communications (www.bankcomm.com/jh/en/index.jsp) is another large
Chinese bank where you can access an ATM. Some good quality hotels also
have ATMs that are hooked up to international networks.
Withdrawing money from an ATM in China is no different from drawing
money out of your ATM at home. Just follow directions, which are in English,
and you can convert money from your foreign bank account into RMB. (Note:
You can’t withdraw foreign currency from ATMs — only Chinese money.)
To be safe, use ATMs during the day at the larger bank branches or at your
hotel.
Using credit and debit cards
Traditionally, credit cards haven’t been widely accepted in China, but this is fast
changing as the government is supporting the use of credit cards in China. The
government wants a bigger credit card network for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
Foreigners use debit cards from domestic and foreign accounts all the time.
You can use international credit cards in large department stores, popular
restaurants, and hotels in medium and large Chinese cities. Credit cards are
also accepted in the Western-style markets in Beijing and Shanghai. Taxis 
do not accept credit card payments. Note that most U.S. card issuers take on
2 to 3 percent “conversion fees” for all foreign currency transactions. This is
true of debit cards as well.
If you need to get a cash advance using your credit card, you need to go to a
major bank. Of course, they charge you a commission.
Call your card company before you leave to alert them that you’re traveling
to China. The company can then expect to see China-related transactions on
your account without concerns about your spending. You don’t want to have
your card blocked while you’re in China.
Using traveler’s cheques
You can pay by traveler’s cheque in China, or any hotel or major bank can
convert your foreign traveler’s cheques into cash. However, most people find
using the Chinese ATM to get cash and using credit cards for major expenses
to be more convenient.
Staying healthy
Nothing’s worse than getting sick or injured in a foreign country. Most people
who travel to China don’t have any problems. The most common ailment for
foreign visitors to China seems to be an upset stomach probably caused by
lower local standards of hygiene.
88
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Generally, business visitors to China stay in the medium and large cities
where hygiene standards are better. Steer clear of poultry markets and rural
areas to avoid any possibility of avian flu exposure. With this and a few other
simple precautions — which we discuss in this section — you can stay
healthy during your visit to China.
Understanding hygiene in China
Hygiene standards in China are likely very different from what you’re used to
back home. For instance, spitting is common there (although some cities are
trying to crack down on it). Beijing seems to be making some progress tack-
ling the spitting problem, but outside of the capital city, there’s still a lot of
spitting going on.
With overcrowded cities, people start living in closer proximity, encouraging
the spread of germs. As a result, you may become mildly ill during a visit to
China. However, here are some preventive measures you can take:
 Take greater care of your hygiene while you’re there. Wash your
hands a lot. Don’t be surprised when you don’t find hot water or soap
while visiting restaurants and other places. A bottle of hand sanitizer
can be one of your best friends in China.
 Plan on using the bathrooms at your hotel, your office, or the factory
you visit. The public bathrooms in China were really meant to serve the
masses, so take advantage of a clean bathroom whenever you can.
 If you cut yourself while shaving or whatever, immediately sterilize it.
Here’s an application for antibacterial gel. Peroxide is even better if you
take it with you. Bacteria levels are so high everywhere that open cuts
have a really high rate of infection.
 Consider wiping down dining ware with a clean cloth napkin or hot
tea if things don’t look very clean. Bring packs of two-ply tissues every-
where, just in case.
89
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China
Getting smoked, Chinese style
The Chinese are really heavy smokers. More
than 350 million Chinese smoke cigarettes, and
the number of new smokers is growing by about
3 million a year. More than 50 percent of men
smoke. Greetings between males usually involve
offering a cigarette. As you may have guessed,
you can find plenty of ashtrays around.
In China, smoking in front of others is still socially
acceptable. If you’re sensitive to smoking, you
may have some problems in China. Smoking
bans are in place in some public places, but
smokers largely ignore them, even smoking right
in front of the Do Not Smoke signs! People rarely
complain about the smoking.

Watching what you drink
Here’s the main rule about drinking water in China: Don’t drink from the tap.
Use only bottled or filtered water. Some people prefer to use the bottled
water to brush their teeth, too. Many medium- to higher-end restaurants in
the major cities serve filtered water; however, if you’re unsure, just assume
that it’s not filtered. Outside of the major cities, also avoid using ice with
your drinks, because the water may not be filtered. Make sure you stay
hydrated in China, especially in the summer.
The Chinese love to drink tea. Take advantage of the great variety of teas and
enjoy the local custom during your visit. In most situations, tea should be a
safe alternative because the water has been boiled. Drinking tea is more than
just a tradition — it’s a safe way to enjoy a pleasant beverage!
As in most cultures, drinking alcohol with a meal is common in China. Be
careful about how much alcohol you consume. Some types of Chinese liquor
can be extremely strong and may leave you with a throbbing head the next
morning. Because you’re traveling on business, often trying to get over jet lag
while negotiating with the Chinese, drink only in moderation.
Minding what you eat
Hopefully, the Chinese food sits well with you during your visit. Enjoying the
Chinese cuisine can be one of the highlights of visiting China.
Some people have trouble adjusting to the amount of oil in Chinese cooking.
Others have a particular sensitivity to MSG (monosodium glutamate). Also
known as Chinese restaurant syndrome, sensitivity to MSG can cause symp-
toms such as a headache and drowsiness. Unfortunately, you can’t do much
to avoid MSG during a visit to China, because almost all Chinese restaurants
use it. If MSG becomes a problem, seek out non-Chinese food restaurants.
If you have food allergies or intolerances, watch out for some of the follow-
ing, which are common in Chinese cooking:
 Fish and shellfish
 Soy, which is present in tofu, soy sauce, salty black beans, and edamame
 Wheat (gluten), which may be in noodles, dumplings, bread, and 
pancakes
Even if you don’t usually have a sensitive stomach, you should bring some
remedies, especially for diarrhea. Most Western remedies are generally avail-
able, but consider bringing your favorite brand with you to China so you can
avoid taking counterfeit medicine.
90
Part II: Starting Up in China 

As delicious as the food may smell, stay away from anything sold by street
vendors. The hygiene standards are less than ideal.
Finding healthcare when you need it
For general ailments, your best choice is to visit a Western-operated clinic.
Western-run clinics usually have decent English-speaking capability. In addi-
tion, they’re less likely to have arbitrary pricing or to recommend unneces-
sary tests. You can choose from several of them in Beijing and Shanghai.
Some higher-end Chinese hospitals also have VIP clinics that offer foreigners
a higher level of service.
In the case of something more severe, look for Western-operated hospitals in
the larger Chinese cities. You may seriously consider traveling to Hong Kong
for healthcare services. If time and conditions allow, just head back home.
If you’re not feeling well before a planned trip to China, do the right thing and
cancel or postpone your visit. You’re much better off getting over your sick-
ness at home.
You can obtain some recommendations of the healthcare facilities available in
your city by contacting your home country’s embassy or consulate. Or your
hotel should be able to tell you what the options are. Otherwise, look for
Western clinics and hospitals in major cities through the Internet and in adver-
tisements in the free expatriate magazines at Western bars and restaurants.
Prices for quality healthcare in China are high, and they may be somewhat
unpredictable. You can expect to pay higher costs for healthcare as a foreign
visitor. Generally, your health insurance should cover your usual and custom-
ary medical expenses while in China. Insurance providers usually reimburse
you after you return home. In Chinese-run clinics and hospitals, you may
have to provide a deposit for your treatment; therefore, if you’re short on
cash, you may want to have your hotel confirm whether the clinic will take a
credit card for payment.
To better understand how your coverage works, check with your healthcare
provider before you make your trip. Make sure you bring your insurance card
with you to China.
Be careful about taking any prescriptions or antibiotics that a Chinese doctor
provides you. Certain prescriptions in China may not be what you’d expect
them to be. Over-the-counter products may not be authentic. The best rec-
ommendation is to bring what you may need in terms of over-the-counter
remedies — especially anti-diarrhea medicine. Eye drops for irritation due to
pollution may be a good idea, too.
91
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China

Weathering China
Because the country is so large, you can be in a subtropical zone one day and
frigid plains the next. Some places in the very south of China don’t even have
a winter. To the north, some regions don’t have a summer — the winters are
very cold, so be prepared. Most of the country has blazing hot weather and
humidity in the summer. (For men, wearing blue shirts in the warm months is
not recommended. If you’re prone to perspire, you’ll look like a wet dish rag
in a blue shirt!)
The most pleasant months to visit China are April, May, September, and
October. During this time, the weather is generally comfortable across China.
Check on the local weather conditions before you go to China. Don’t be
fooled into believing that being on the same latitude means that the tempera-
tures are the same as elsewhere in the world. Find out what the local condi-
tions are like in China before you start packing. Bring a variety of clothes that
can keep you comfortable for the places you’ll visit in China.
Preparing for crowding and noise
With the rise of China’s economic prowess, more people have migrated to the
cities in China. They’re seeking better jobs that offer better pay than what’s
offered in the countryside. As a result, life in China’s cities is crowded. With a
population of 1.3 billion, this statement may be a little obvious, but once you
get there, you realize what “crowded” really means. Beijing’s population is
more than 11 million, Shanghai’s tops 18 million, and Guangzhou has 11 mil-
lion people. While you’re there, forget about personal space, and get to know
your new neighbors.
Noise levels in China are high — you deal with city noise, construction noise,
factory noise, people noise, and all sorts of other noise. China has noise pol-
lution laws, but enforcement is still a work in progress. You often hear
Chinese shouting into cellphones, talking during musical concerts, and jab-
bering loudly over a meal. The level of noise can be high in public places
such as restaurants and factories and even on airplanes. You soon learn to
take this in stride.
Dealing with pollution
China’s burst on the scene as the world’s factory has had both positive and
negative results. On the downside, many of China’s bustling cities are incredi-
bly polluted, tainting their rivers and streams. Don’t be surprised by factories
92
Part II: Starting Up in China 

that pour toxic chemicals down manholes, people using the road as a trash
disposal, and a blanket of haze where a sunny blue sky should be. Sometimes
the pollution can be so bad that your eyes begin to sting. Although the
Chinese authorities have installed plans to improve the overall situation,
there’s been little short-term progress in the way of improvement.
Most of the time you’ll be indoors, so pollution shouldn’t have too much of
an effect on you, but be prepared. You may want to bring some eyewash with
you when you visit China if you’re sensitive to air pollution. Also, if you have
a respiratory condition, such as asthma, be sure to pack medications to
avoid flare-ups.
Staying Out of Trouble
This section goes through some of what you can do to protect yourself from
scams, crime, and legal problems.
Contacting your embassy or consulate
If your travel plans include staying at a place other than an international,
standard tourist hotel, registering with your nearest embassy or consulate —
before you need assistance — may be a good idea. Many embassies and con-
sulates in China have registration procedures for visitors. In the event of an
emergency, the embassy or consulate knows where to contact you.
If you need any help in China, contact your embassy or consulate as soon as
you can. Keep the contact details of the embassy or consulate with you when
you travel to China. Most European, North American, and some Asian coun-
tries have consulates in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other
places in China.
Protecting yourself against crime
Researchers estimate that the transient population in China is over 120 million
people, representing almost 10 percent of China’s population. Most of the tran-
sient population has flocked from the countryside to China’s booming cities in
search of jobs. With such a large number of people on the move, it’s not sur-
prising that crime is on the rise. Many people are out of work as China’s “iron
rice bowl” (employment and benefits guaranteed by the government) no
longer applies, and desperation can move some people to illegal actions.
93
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China

Take the usual precautions while in China. The best advice is to be alert at all
times. Here are some other tips:
 Try to keep only a minimum amount of cash with you at all times.
 Be mindful that expensive jewelry, watches, personal digital assistants
(PDAs), and laptops are attractive targets for thieves.
 Walking the street at night in the larger cites is usually no problem, but
try to stick to high-traffic areas and avoid poorly lit side streets.
China can be a safe place for visiting foreigners; however, crime does occur.
Pickpocketing and theft are the most common types of crimes against foreign
visitors. The pickpockets and thieves may work in gangs, so be aware that
more than one person may be looking to take advantage of you. China’s pick-
pockets can be extremely skillful, so take nothing for granted.
Generally, crime against foreigners takes place in tourist areas, bar areas at
night, street markets, airport areas, and so on. Beggars often work in gangs
using young children as bait to get you to give them money. Sometimes,
people may try to force business flyers or cards into your pockets with intent
to pick your pocket.
Shenzhen and Guangzhou, to the south, have higher incidence rates of petty
and occasionally violent crimes against foreigners. Sometimes foreigners are
forced to withdraw cash from an ATM. Although these incidents aren’t very
common, you should be especially careful at night in these and other south-
ern Chinese cities. If you’re the victim of a crime, contact the police as soon
as possible. Keep the police report in the event that your loss is covered by
insurance.
Foiling scam attempts
Avoid people who approach you on the street to offer you sightseeing or
shopping tours. Tour scams are particularly common in China. Guides may
approach you at tourist places, offer special tours at inflated prices, and then
make stops at factories, restaurants, and stores to try to get you to buy
goods at inflated prices. If you do take a tour, often the best approach is to
refuse to participate in the shopping stops by enjoying a brief rest rather
than feeling pressured to spend money.
94
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Staying clear of counterfeits
Fake currency is a major concern in China. It usually involves the 50 and 100
RMB bills, so use smaller bills to pay for whatever you buy in the local mar-
kets. This is a safe way to avoid having someone’s fake currency passed to
you during the purchase.
Identifying a counterfeit bill can be quite challenging for foreigners. Like most
fake currency, the forged bills in China contain images that aren’t as clear as
the real notes. Other than carefully checking your bills, you can do little
about it. If you do get a bogus note, you can do what most people do: Just try
to pass it off on somebody else later (doing this in dark places is easiest)!
Don’t exchange money on the street, at tourist destinations, or anywhere
else. Exchanging currency at unauthorized places in China is against the law.
The rates of exchange will likely not be in your favor, and you may wind up
with counterfeit money.
Fake or counterfeit goods are also a problem in China. If someone offers to
sell you something below the expected price, be very wary. Bootleg DVDs are
commonly sold on the street.
Avoid buying from the street vendors while in China. Buying fake merchan-
dise is against the law in China, and it’s often an infringement on worldwide
copyrights. The risk of getting into trouble at customs isn’t worth the dis-
count you got for fake goods.
Keeping out of restricted areas
Most businesspeople travel to China for the more popular cities along the
coast or those just inland a few hundred miles. More than 1,000 Chinese
cities are open to foreign visitors, but that’s obviously not the whole country.
Some remote and sensitive areas are closed to foreigners.
The restricted or closed areas are usually in remote areas in China. Generally,
most businesspeople wouldn’t travel to these areas, anyway. If you have any
questions, contact the Chinese embassy or consulate before you start your
trip to China.
95
Chapter 5: Traveling to and around China

Avoiding legal problems
Be on your best behavior in China by respecting the local laws and customs,
and you won’t have any problems. The best rule is to act responsibly and use
common sense — go about your business as you would in your home coun-
try. Be sure to deal with people who are reputable and are acting within the
law. Avoid areas where any illegal activity may be taking place, and keep clear
of any activities related to the military or political activities while you’re in
China. (For information on Chinese business laws, check out Chapter 8.)

Getting Business Going through
Successful Negotiation
In This Chapter
 Getting a handle on what the Chinese are thinking
 Understanding Chinese negotiating tactics
 Playing the game your way
 Negotiating after you’ve made the deal
 Ending on the right note
T
o be sure, the Chinese are difficult and shrewd negotiators — after all,
they’ve been haggling for the last 5,000 years! The Chinese seem to
hammer away at you until you agree to do business the “Chinese way.”
Therefore, you need to be ready for negotiations that are very relationship-
based and ready for meetings and discussions that are very formal.
Make no mistake: Negotiating will test your limits! The Chinese seem to have
unlimited time to negotiate with foreigners. Sometimes, you may think to
yourself, “Don’t these people have anything else to do?” Meanwhile, your
boss back at headquarters expects some good news soon about signing a
contract with the Chinese.
Although negotiating with the Chinese is a challenge, it certainly can be
worthwhile in the end. We hope you find that the Chinese make great busi-
ness partners. This chapter can help you and your company better under-
stand how negotiations really work in China and the strategies and tactics
that the Chinese use. Note: Although this chapter focuses on negotiating 
specific business deals, the general advice here holds true for most negotia-
tions with the Chinese.

Preparing for the Process
Negotiating with the Chinese can be hard enough — you don’t want to make
it any harder by not being prepared. Getting your team together beforehand
to prepare for the negotiations is sure to improve your chances of success.
Most people going to China from outside Southeast Asia are very jetlagged
when they arrive. We recommend that you don’t get involved in important
negotiations during your first few days in China. Also, plan to stay long
enough during your trips to China. You need more time to get things done 
the Chinese way.
Organizing your team
Here are some aspects to consider when deciding who should be involved in
negotiations:
 Leadership: The Chinese like to deal with a single leader, so have the
most senior person from your company represent you as the leader at
the negotiating table. He or she should have authority to make deci-
sions. (For more information on Chinese business meetings, go to
Chapter 11.)
 Head count and role call: Bringing the right skills to the table is highly
important. In the beginning of discussions, your technical people need
to be at your side. Also, being underrepresented may give the Chinese
the impression that you’re not serious, so be sure that you bring along
other experienced team members as well.
 Consistency: The Chinese don’t like changes in your negotiating team.
You may need some technical representatives for part of the discus-
sions, but having a core team that represents your company through it
all is best. Try to have the same company leader from start to finish.
At least one of your company representatives needs to be at all the
meetings so that one or more people know the history of the entire
negotiation. This move protects your company from any false claims
from the Chinese that you agreed to something previously.
Assemble your team before any meeting takes place. Go over the progress so
far and goals for the meeting. You can also discuss what concessions you’re
willing to trade off. And remember to discuss what trade-offs are absolutely
nonnegotiable with your team.
98
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Developing trust and then 
doing your bargaining
Through all the negotiating, the Chinese are still trying to figure out whether
they want to do business with you and your company. You need to convince
the Chinese that you and your company are committed to the Chinese
market and to working with them as a trusted partner. Demonstrate that
you’re open and honest, and take the time to get to know the representatives
from the Chinese side on a personal level.
Reputation is extremely important, so you need to prove to the Chinese that
you and your firm are reputable. Give real-world examples where your firm
has lived up to its commitments, and allow the Chinese to check out your
existing business relationships so they can get a good idea of how your firm
does business. Better yet, if you’re lucky enough to already have some suc-
cessful relationships in China or Asia, use these contacts as references.
You can also build trust by hosting a small group of your Chinese counter-
parts at your company’s headquarters or arranging for the Chinese to visit
your place of business back home. The Chinese generally like overseas busi-
ness travel and are impressed that you think highly enough of the relation-
ship to invite them. Obtaining a visa for visiting Chinese can sometimes be
problematic in certain countries, so plan accordingly. U.S. companies that
belong to an American chamber of commerce in China may be able to take
advantage of a program to expedite visas for their Chinese guests.
Considering how best to divide the pie
A Chinese CEO of one of the largest privately held Chinese companies recom-
mends that foreign businesspeople not negotiate with the Chinese. In his
mind, “negotiation” implies a zero sum mentality — that in order for you to
win, the Chinese side must lose. Instead, he suggests that you consider how
to divide the pie with them so that both sides win. In other words, think
about how best to distribute the benefits of a commercial relationship with
the Chinese. The Chinese certainly do expect their fair share. (For more on
mutual benefit, go to Chapter 11.)
Finding out what the other side needs the most makes negotiating a lot easier.
Here’s a list of Chinese counterparts and what they may be looking for:
 Government officials: They normally want benefits for their city or
region. They want new factories that produce new jobs and more taxes.
 Businesses: They’re typically looking for new technologies that can
improve their position in their home market or export market.
99
Chapter 6: Getting Business Going through Successful Negotiation

 Service industries: They’re looking for know-how from the West so they
can be more competitive in a quickly deregulating business environment.
The Chinese take a lot of pride in their country, so they like to be assured
that your relationship will not only bring business benefits to them but also
do something good for China. For example, if you’re acquiring a poorly per-
forming company in China and taking on pension liabilities, you can empha-
size that your company will guarantee to honor future benefits for retirees,
which is something the current owners may not be able to do.
Practicing the Chinese Art of Negotiating
Negotiating with the Chinese is a combination of hard-nosed bargaining, rela-
tionship building, and banqueting. When negotiating with the Chinese, being
polite, understanding, and respectful of the cultural differences is extremely
important; however, you also need to be a skilled negotiator to keep up with
your potential new partners.
Although your Chinese hosts are incredibly hospitable, you can expect your
counterparts to be very smart and demanding at the negotiating table. This
section explains how the Chinese think and act when dealing with foreigners.
100
Part II: Starting Up in China 
Appealing to SOEs and private companies
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private
Chinese companies often look for different ben-
efits. You have to adjust your negotiating style
(and possibly business plan) for each group:
 SOEs are often focused on protecting 
or creating jobs, so in many cases, they’re
not that interested in efficiency. They also
like to do deals that help them achieve
political business goals (such as “green
development”).
 Private Chinese companies are very
bottom-line focused, and they value many
of the same things that their Western coun-
terparts do — profits, efficiency, and so on.
SOEs have a tough negotiating style for two rea-
sons. First, they possess many of the country’s
best assets — and they know it, so they’re
aware of their leverage. Many of them also take
their charge to protect the value of those assets
very seriously, so they proceed cautiously to
make sure that they’re not getting a bad deal.
This process often involves a good deal of inter-
nal approvals. Because private companies
haven’t had access to those prized assets,
they’re much more efficient — including in
negotiations. Their decision-making is usually
centralized with the largest shareholder. Unlike
SOEs, the owner/largest shareholder can usu-
ally approve a deal with a good deal of speed, if
he or she is so inclined.

After many attempts to get to an agreement, you may find that you can’t 
conclude a satisfactory deal. Don’t be afraid to walk away from a bad deal. If
you’ve been negotiating for about a year, you’re probably at the end of your
rope. Make sure you let the Chinese know from the beginning that you’re
responsible for looking out for the best interests of your company — even if
that means not reaching a negotiated agreement with them.
Thinking like the Chinese
Thinking like the Chinese is a good way to get an understanding of their 
negotiating strategies. This section explains some Chinese perspectives.
Developing a relationship is most important
Many Westerners negotiating in China emphasize getting a contract signed;
however, the Chinese believe that developing a relationship is the primary
objective of any negotiation. Foreign businesspeople tend not to fully under-
stand the importance that the Chinese place on relationship building. 
First, the Chinese need to be satisfied that a good long-term relationship with
your company is possible. They consider criteria such as
 The people who represent your company
 The way you conduct business
 Whether you do what you say you’re going to do
 The success of your company in the international market
 Your company’s reputation
Only then do they ask themselves, “Are you the right partner? Can I do busi-
ness with you over the long term?” (For more about relationships, go to
Chapter 15.)
Sometimes you may feel like the Chinese don’t trust you. Some people say
the suspicion has to do with the past abuses by foreign powers in China (see
Chapter 3 for details). Whatever the cause, the Chinese need to be comfort-
able in dealing with you before they begin any discussions “Developing trust
and then doing your bargaining,” earlier in the chapter).
The Chinese often don’t believe that the signed contract defines the agree-
ment. Many times, they think that the contract is just a snapshot of what was
agreed to then and there. (For more on contracts, go to Chapter 18.) Be pre-
pared to hold the Chinese feet to the fire if they don’t perform their obliga-
tions according to the contract.
101
Chapter 6: Getting Business Going through Successful Negotiation

Sometimes the Chinese try to have it both ways. When the snapshot view
benefits them, they may tell you it’s only a snapshot. However, if you try to
play the game the same way, don’t be surprised if they expect you to adhere
to the letter of the contract! For info on strategies, see the upcoming section
titled “Navigating Chinese negotiation tactics.”
Haggling is expected — and kind of fun
The Chinese like to haggle about everything — it’s part of their culture. They
bargain over the price of fish in the market. They squabble over the discount
on the purchase of a washing machine. In their daily lives, they wrangle over
most everything they buy. So don’t be surprised when the Chinese want to
negotiate all the nitty-gritty details of the deal with you.
Navigating Chinese negotiation tactics
The Chinese use some common tactics in negotiations. We explain some of
these tactics so you’re ready to negotiate from a position of strength.
The Chinese like to take their time when starting up negotiations, so don’t get
down to business right away. Take your time by making small talk for a while.
(For more information about business meetings, go to Chapter 11.)
The setup: Accusing you of violating the guiding principles
The Chinese usually open negotiations by thoroughly explaining broad guide-
lines for the discussion — its guiding principles. For instance, the Chinese
often emphasize that “mutual benefit” will be one of the guiding principles. In
this way, they set up the expectation that any negotiated agreement will be
fair to the Chinese side.
Pay careful attention to what the Chinese tell you during the start of any
negotiations. They explain to you at length what their expectations are. They
often use broadly worded statements that give the Chinese flexibility in inter-
preting them the way they want. Later, they continually refer back to these
principles and try and use them to their advantage.
After setting the stage, the Chinese finally get to the details. At some point,
they don’t like what your side proposes. They say what you’ve suggested vio-
lates the spirit of the guiding principles that they so carefully explained to
you in the beginning. You’re not living up to your end of the deal.
Shame on you for trying to pull a fast one on the Chinese! Now you’ve created
a problem, and you have to fix it. This Chinese negotiating tactic is classic:
They try to make you feel guilty about how you’re negotiating with them.
Their hope is that this tactic triggers the response they’re looking for. You
guessed it: concessions from your side! You need to remind them that “mutual
benefit” (or any of their other open-ended principles) is a two-way street.
102
Part II: Starting Up in China 

You, too, can play the game the Chinese way. If they lay out their guiding prin-
ciples, you can do the same. The Chinese should get the idea that the discus-
sions need to be more balanced.
The demand: Asking for the moon
A favorite Chinese tactic is to make outrageous demands. The Chinese can
put on quite a performance. With a straight face, they ask you to pay for all
the business insurance costs because the Chinese say they’re not necessary.
Or they ask to be your exclusive distributor in perpetuity. Or they want you
to pay for all expenses involving expatriate costs. Their attitude seems to be
that there’s no harm in asking.
When the Chinese do make an outrageous request, they generally see a slim
chance of getting what they’re asking for. By setting the bar so high, the
Chinese have more room to negotiate a better deal for themselves. The
Chinese put an obligation on you to come up with something closer to what
they’ve asked for — not a bad negotiating tactic if you can get away with it.
Leave yourself some wiggle room in your position in case you need to make
some concessions. But after you reach your bottom line, say no (see “Saying
no the Chinese way,” later in this chapter). And maybe say it several more
times! If you don’t, you can expect the Chinese to ask you to cough up even
more concessions.
The better offer: Threatening to go to one of your competitors
The Chinese like to create competition for their business by negotiating with
several foreign companies at once. The message is that if the Chinese can’t
work out a deal with you, they’ll go to one of your big competitors, often in
Germany or Japan.
Talk to several potential Chinese business partners about possible coopera-
tion, and the people you’re negotiating with will have to compete for your
business as well. Bargaining in China is difficult, and reaching a negotiated
agreement can be highly unpredictable. You have plenty of partners to
choose from, so make sure you take the time to find the right one.
Divide and conquer: Pointing out your inconsistencies
One negotiating tactic is to try to divide and conquer the visiting foreign
negotiators. The Chinese look for inconsistent messages or points of view
from your negotiating team. If you’re giving mixed signals to the Chinese by
offering multiple approaches or proposals, the Chinese may seek to exploit
them to their full advantage. Therefore, careful cooperation and teamwork
are necessary. If one of your subordinates makes a misstep in judgment, your
leaders can tell the Chinese that the employee didn’t know what he or she
was talking about. However, this tactic causes your subordinate to lose face
to the Chinese, which you should consider before acting.
103
Chapter 6: Getting Business Going through Successful Negotiation

Look for the same openings the Chinese do. If you find contradictions from
the Chinese side, try to use them to your company’s advantage.
The clock: Outlasting your patience or citing deadlines
When the Chinese take their time explaining the broad principles guiding the
discussion, you may start to grow restless. You start looking at your watch.
Your flight home leaves in two days, and you feel like the discussions have
just started to move forward. Whenever you begin to push things along and
get into the details, the Chinese circle back and continue to talk about their
expectations.
The Chinese often use the clock as a negotiating tool. To them, most foreign-
ers seem to be in a rush to get a contract signed or a deal done, so the
Chinese deliberately try to control the timing and progress of the negotia-
tions. The waiting game that the Chinese play really wears down most foreign
businesspeople, and your counterparts know it. Negotiating a complex agree-
ment in China may take as long as a year.
The Chinese also may pressure your company into making concessions by
rushing you. They inform you of a deadline — sometimes just a week away.
They insist that the agreement be completed by a certain date. Often, they
say that the government officials who’ll be signing the agreement are avail-
able to do so only on a particular day. For visiting foreign businesspeople,
knowing whether the Chinese message is fact or fiction is difficult.
Here are some tips for working with the clock:
 Leave plenty of time in your schedule for negotiations, and never reveal
any internal deadlines your company may have on any China-related
project.
 Set deadlines with the Chinese, and keep trying to push things along.
Tell your Chinese counterparts that your company has a certain number
of days to work on this very important project.
 Organize the agenda in a way that addresses the important issues early.
 Gain a home-field advantage by having the Chinese negotiate at your
headquarters.
 A potential partner who abuses the clock in negotiations may be quite
difficult to work with throughout your relationship. In that situation,
consider looking for a new partner.
Taking the time to get it right
Some people say that negotiations in China have a beginning, a middle, and
never seem to end! As we discuss in Chapter 11, both sides need patience
104
Part II: Starting Up in China 

when doing business in China. Here’s why your Chinese counterparts may be
taking their time:
 They’re using the time wisely to make sure the deal is done the correct
way, even though you keep checking your watch — and calendar! They’re
willing to go slowly in the beginning to ensure that everything will work
out in the long term.
 They’re concerned about losing face (for more about face, go to Chap-
ter 11). They don’t want to risk getting embarrassed by putting together
a bad deal, so the Chinese negotiators take every precaution — including
as much time as they need — to make sure the deal is a good one.
 The person you’re dealing with doesn’t have the power to make a decision
on a particular matter and needs to seek approval from someone else.
This is often the case with SOEs, which use a decision-by-committee
process. As a result, internal approval at SOEs often takes more time than
it does with private companies.
 The Chinese are using the delay as a negotiating tool (see the preceding
section).
 The Chinese side is sorting out internal issues among themselves. 
(For more on Chinese style of consensus management, see Chapter 11.)
When the Chinese specifically say there’s no problem with the way you
want to proceed, there usually is one. When you hear the expression 
mei wenti (pronounced may one-tee), which means no problem, dive
deeper into a discussion to look for any problems.
Although deal-making usually takes longer in China, negotiations can also
speed up unexpectedly at times. Perhaps one of the Chinese government offi-
cials wants to conclude the deal by a certain date to look good with the big
boss. If you’re pleasantly surprised with the pace of the negotiations, keep
the momentum going on your side, too.
If the businesspeople you’re dealing with in China really want to do things in
a hurry, trouble may be lurking around the corner. Be careful that you’re not
exposing your company to some scam. China doesn’t have a lot of trans-
parency concerning company information, so use every source at your dis-
posal to thoroughly check out your business partner before agreeing to
anything. For more on due diligence, please see Chapter 17.
Exchanging information
Often, impatient foreign negotiators reveal their hand before the Chinese
show any cards. Don’t give any specific information to the Chinese side 
about your company’s negotiating position, and don’t provide any detailed
105
Chapter 6: Getting Business Going through Successful Negotiation

proposals to the Chinese in hopes of jump-starting the negotiations. Don’t tell
them what the venture, deal, or arrangements can or should look like. And
don’t let down your guard under pressure to explain your proposal.
You can give the Chinese side information about your business — as long as
you don’t give away any proprietary or confidential information. For exam-
ple, you can tell them how your company is structured and the types of prod-
ucts you make. You simply don’t want to go into details of what makes up
your product. For example, you don’t want to tell them the secret formula 
for your line of soap products. And don’t give them samples of your products
if you think reverse engineering them is possible.
The Chinese expect you to give away a lot of information. They ask for
detailed explanations as if they know nothing about your business. But in the
beginning of negotiations, they’re not usually very willing to tell you much
from their end. If the negotiations go well from a Chinese perspective, they’ll
begin to share appropriate information with you. As a general rule, expect
them to provide you with as much information as you provided them. Before
the start of negotiations, you can gain more information about the company
and its business from the marketplace. See the upcoming “Using intermedi-
aries effectively” section for advice on how to find information the right way.
Keeping track of all the details
Capturing the details of what goes on in all your negotiations with the
Chinese is a must, so take detailed notes. You’ll likely need to bring up past
discussions during the later stages of negotiating. The Chinese keep very
accurate records of conversations at your meetings, and they’ll be sure to
recall any significant statement your company makes — especially where
they find inconsistencies in what your team suggested.
Note-taking is also a good signal to the Chinese that you’re as serious about
the negotiations as they are and that you’re not losing sight of what’s impor-
tant. Of course, you need to take notes only at formal business meetings.
Also consider taking a timeout when negotiating with the Chinese — simply
pause to reinforce what’s been agreed to so far. That way, you can avoid 
covering old ground in the future and avoid possible deal-breaking 
misunderstandings.
Have the points that have been agreed to so far put in English and Chinese
right away. Get both sides to agree to them in writing. You can then move on
to the next stage of discussions.
106
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Saying no the Chinese way
Because the Chinese are very concerned about causing anyone (on either
side) to lose face, they don’t like to use the word no during negotiations. (For
more about face, please go to Chapter 11.) The Chinese are worried that they
may offend you by sounding too negative, so they say no indirectly — “this
may be a bit difficult” or “this could be a problem for us.” Foreigners some-
times assume they’re making progress when the Chinese are really rejecting
the idea. You need to appreciate that hinting at a no is a refusal.
Don’t be afraid to say no to the Chinese — they’re used to hearing foreigners
respond this way — but try softening the tone a bit by making it more polite
and subdued. Perhaps the best way to say it is “this may be difficult.” They’ll
respect you more if you deliver the message less directly.
Treating anger appropriately
Chinese negotiators used to rarely display anger — it’s a violation of
Confucian principle. In those situations, foreigners would’ve done well to be
similarly reserved. However, like many cultural rules, this provision was a bit
more relaxed for foreigners. Today, Chinese negotiators commonly make a
show — at least one time — of losing their tempers. This idea is particularly
true when you’re dealing with the owner of a private company.
If the Chinese side shows anger, the chances are that it’s as much for theatri-
cal value as anything else. The key is to keep your composure. Don’t worry
that you may have gravely insulted Mr. Zhu in a way that’s never happened
before. Try to show a little concern, but don’t fall for any suggestion that you
have to work hard to make it up to him.
If the need arises, you can show your temper as well. Because the anger 
display has more significance in Chinese culture (again, being contrary to
Confucian teachings), you want to save it for when it counts. But when you
really want to make a point — especially if you’re genuinely angry — don’t be
afraid to show anger. Try not to go overboard for the context, though. If your
counterparty seems to be more reserved, don’t lay in too much. If he or she
is a bit more mercurial, you have greater license.
When showing your temper, don’t make it personal and cause somebody to
lose face. In other words, avoid using you too much. Use phrases such as we
were told rather than you said. However, you can make an exception if you’re
personally insulted. For example, if somebody on the other side constantly
interrupts you or essentially tells you that you don’t know what you’re talk-
ing about, such actions would rise to the level of a personal insult worthy of a
personal response.
107
Chapter 6: Getting Business Going through Successful Negotiation

In general, you want to stay away from getting drawn into mind games of
when to show anger — it only complicates the discussions. Although a dis-
play of anger can be part of the process, make sure you and your team
remain professional in your dealings with the Chinese. Don’t spend time
deciding when and how to get angry.
Using intermediaries effectively
Using intermediaries can be a constructive way to communicate with your
Chinese counterparts. It’s not as common in China today as it once was, but
when you’re dealing with the government and/or government businesses,
using an intermediary does have its advantages. The intermediary often works
behind the scenes after the most recent formal negotiating session is complete.
The Chinese sometimes use intermediaries to get important messages to you.
They may prefer to have someone else ask you a difficult question, or they may
not feel comfortable speaking to you directly on something because they don’t
know you well enough yet. After the relationship is more developed, you likely
won’t need to use an intermediary as much. The intermediary usually delivers
any messages to your side’s senior leadership in a face-to-face private meeting.
Sometimes, using an intermediary can provide you with information that the
Chinese side hasn’t revealed. Intermediaries can help you figure out what the
Chinese negotiating position may be. The intermediary can also signal your
intentions to the Chinese.
Consider using an appropriate person whom both sides know well as the 
go-between during your negotiations with the Chinese. If you were first intro-
duced to the Chinese company through a personal connection, whoever
made that introduction may be useful as an intermediary with your potential
partner.
Don’t trust an intermediary too much. If anything, he or she is likely to favor
the Chinese side. Therefore, don’t let the intermediary know your bottom
line. Also, take certain things the intermediate says with a grain of salt — 
particularly if he or she is communicating a ridiculous demand from the
other side and telling you it’s the only way to get the deal done.
Making concessions
The Chinese expect you to make significant concessions for the opportunity
to work with them. They insist that they’re willing to make concessions, too.
108
Part II: Starting Up in China 

This statement is usually just a way for the Chinese to get your side to make
further concessions, not to favor your company in any way.
Your company can play the tit-for-tat game, too. You should have plenty of
minor concessions you can give the Chinese in return. For example, you may
agree to have the Chinese language version of an agreement appear first, with
the English version second. (Note that this concession doesn’t refer to con-
trolling language, which we discuss in Chapter 18.)
The deals that the Chinese offer are usually small and not very meaningful.
But they like to tell you that these concessions are significant. Like your side,
they have a laundry list of giveaways, too.
Unless your main concern is the amount of the economics you’re entitled to
in a joint venture (JV), “control” is an issue where you can usually make con-
cessions. If you’ll have over 50 percent of the equity and board members,
going to war over exactly how much equity you’ll have usually isn’t worth the
effort. As we discuss in Chapter 7, by law certain critical decisions need
unanimous board approval.
Banqueting as part of the deal making
The Chinese use entertaining as part of relationship building. It’s really part
of the negotiating game, too. On one hand, they’re trying to soften you up by
being extremely gracious hosts during the elaborate Chinese banquets.
They’re also sizing you up, trying to see who the key influencers are, and get-
ting to better understand the leadership structure and personalities within
your company.
You banquet often during the various stages of negotiations with the Chinese
(though you don’t actually conduct business at the banquet itself). Expect to
be on the banqueting circuit every time you visit China. See Chapter 16 for
more on dining.
Banqueting in China generally involves lots of drinking and socializing with
your Chinese negotiators. Your negotiating team will be included in all the
banquets. The Chinese have a reputation of getting foreign visitors to drink
pretty hard the night before key negotiations are to begin. Also, the alcohol
served at banquets tends to produce nasty hangovers. Don’t fall into this
trap: Be sure to minimize your intake of alcohol when you’re in China to nego-
tiate on behalf of your company.
109
Chapter 6: Getting Business Going through Successful Negotiation

Earning Approvals in China:
Understanding the Bureaucracy
The Chinese bureaucracy is extremely large and complex. It stretches from
the central government in Beijing all the way to the local village in the coun-
tryside. Fortunately, the Chinese government is giving more autonomy to the
local government officials. Nowadays, only the mega deals or projects involv-
ing sensitive industries need to be approved by the central government. For
most small- to medium-sized businesses, you likely need to deal only with the
local government bureaucracy.
Getting approvals in China is hard work. Usually, the smaller the deal, the
fewer approvals you need. However, you need lots of time to get those
required approvals, permits, signatures, and chops (stamps) from the local
government officials. Most foreign businesspeople underestimate the amount
of time to get approval in China. You can expect some approvals to take up to
several months. (For more on the approval process, see Chapter 7; also see
Chapter 13 for manufacturing approvals.)
Unlike in the West, local government officials in China have much more influ-
ence on daily business activities. For example, the mayor of a city may have
leverage to help you in a dispute with a Chinese company in his or her city.
Therefore, having good relationships with the right government officials
makes getting the required approvals easier.
Local officials can make the difference in how quickly you can get established
and up and running in China. You need their support for a wide variety of
business activities. They may decide whether your factory gets more or less
electricity, help you get the right permits to expand your local factory, and
approve your business license to operate in China. Know who the local offi-
cials are, develop solid relationships with them, and stay on their good side
(see Chapter 8 for details). Try to find a channel to get introduced to them —
a Chinese intermediary may be able to do the job.
Negotiating after the Deal
After numerous rounds of negotiations, countless hours of explaining your
position to the Chinese, and too many toasts at evening banquets, you
believe you’re closer to getting the deal done. But just when you think the
negotiations are over and you have a signed contract in hand, the Chinese
start renegotiating with you. Negotiating with the Chinese seems to be end-
less. This is one of the cruelest lessons for foreigners who are new to dealing
with the Chinese.
110
Part II: Starting Up in China 

The Chinese believe that when circumstances change in business, they can
count on you to work together to fix the problem. They believe that the relation-
ship that they’ve built with your company, not what the contract says, is what
counts. And now that things have changed, the Chinese fully expect to discuss
the terms and conditions of the contract again. Although your first reaction may
be “This can’t be happening,” it happens every day in China. So take a deep
breath and sit down to discuss the situation with your Chinese partner.
Unfortunately, reopening negotiations isn’t a two-way street. When a change
negatively impacts the Chinese, they expect you to help fix the problem;
when you’re in a similar situation, don’t expect a warm reception from the
Chinese. They look at it as your problem, not theirs.
At Long Last: Telling the Public 
and Celebrating the Deal
Although most of the hard work is behind you now, you still need to get a few
very important details right. You’ll be working very closely with your new
Chinese partner in figuring out how to deal with the news of your new ven-
ture, preparing for the formal signing ceremony, and last but not least, cele-
brating the new relationship. In this section, we show you how to wrap things
up the Chinese way.
Announcing the news
If the Chinese agree to an announcement, you need to negotiate the wording
in both Chinese and English. The last remaining detail is to agree on when
and where to simultaneously release the announcement. Usually, the press
releases are announced simultaneously in China and your home country. To
be polite, consider letting the Chinese side announce it just before you do.
Make sure you’ve obtained all government approvals for your company to
operate in China. The last thing you want is to announce the deal before the
government has finally approved it.
Chinese and foreign companies often sign a letter of intent before full negotia-
tions have finished. The letter of intent can be announced before the negotia-
tions and approval process are finished, but you still need to get your
Chinese partner’s approval before you make anything public.
Never release any announcement without getting permission from your
Chinese partners first. Sometimes, the Chinese don’t want too much fanfare
or publicity around business deals. For example, a local government official
may not want the sale of a state-owned enterprise (SOE) to be announced
111
Chapter 6: Getting Business Going through Successful Negotiation

because he or she fears the price was too low and doesn’t want to risk get-
ting criticized. To respect the government officials’ wishes, no press release
or public statement would be made.
Showing off for the cameras 
at the signing ceremony
For deals that the Chinese want to publicize, they really do like to make a big
splash. Formal signing ceremonies are very common in China. You and your
Chinese counterparts need to work together carefully to organize this event.
Usually, these events take place in ballrooms of flashy five-star hotels in China.
Signs announcing the deal are in the background in English and Chinese and
sometimes other languages. Everyone wears his or her best attire. Senior man-
agement from each company wears boutonnieres or corsages. Sometimes,
flags representing each country are on display on the table. Beautiful flower
arrangements adorn the podiums and tables.
Each company brings in several senior officers to the ceremony, and each
side generally makes a speech congratulating the other on the venture. You
do lots of clapping, and both sides are all smiles. It’s the perfect photo op and
a testament that you and your Chinese partner have entered into a new
phase of your relationship.
Celebrating the venture
The Chinese like to celebrate their newly formed partnerships with foreign-
ers through one large, elaborate, and expensive banquet. (See Chapter 16 for
more on banqueting in China.) The guests include the important relation-
ships from both sides, including selected government officials. The guest list
for the Chinese side is usually larger than yours, if only because they have a
greater number of relationships in China.
The banquet is usually hosted jointly by both companies. You need to come
to an agreement on who pays for it. Generally, the hosts share the costs
equally.
For very large companies that are celebrating a major deal, having several
hundred guests to celebrate the venture is not uncommon. For smaller com-
panies, a celebratory banquet is likely to include two dozen people. After
your long negotiations with the Chinese, you’re ready to celebrate your new
commercial relationship in style.

In This Chapter

 Setting up your company
G
ood things come to those who wait. Keep this idea in mind as you go
through the process of setting up your company in China. It’s important
not just because you need to deal with a lot of paperwork (you do) but also
because you need a lot of time to analyze your various decisions.
This chapter primes you for some of the basic issues you have to deal with
when establishing a business in China. We look at the business structures
available, examine issues related to restrictions and approvals, and provide
insight into the various locations in China for establishing a business.
Choosing the Right Business Structure
Setting up shop in China unfortunately isn’t as easy as incorporating a com-
pany and opening your doors. You have two overall choices:
 Representative office
 Foreign-invested enterprise (FIE), operated as either
• A joint venture (JV)
• A wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE)
Whether you should set up a rep office or an FIE partially depends on whether
your company will be collecting money in China. Sending money offshore can
be challenging. When you receive money from customers inside of China, get-
ting it out is harder than what you’re probably used to. Your customers may
have a hard time sending money to your foreign bank account, too! (To under-
stand these issues better, read this chapter closely with Chapter 10.)

If you need to collect money from businesses or others inside of China, select
one of the FIE options. If not, opt for the representative office, which is an
easier entity to establish.
Representative offices
A representative office (rep office) is technically not a company in China; it’s con-
sidered an extension of your offshore company. The representative office isn’t
directly doing business in China — rather, it’s doing indirect business such as
consulting, sourcing, support, and liaison activities. To set up a rep office, you
need to already have a company set up in another country (offshore).
The main advantage of a representative office is that it’s usually easier to 
set up than an actual company. Rep offices don’t require registered capital
(see the next section on foreign-invested enterprises).
China hasn’t made clear what a “direct” business activity is, but the govern-
ment generally considers producing and selling to be direct. Therefore, a rep
office wouldn’t work for a manufacturing operation. On the other hand, in
some highly regulated industries (such as legal services), foreign investors
are allowed only to use rep offices.
The most important feature is that rep offices can receive payment only to
accounts outside of China for their activities within China. Therefore, your
customers must pay you in your foreign currency and send the payment to
your offshore account. (To understand more about paying money offshore,
see Chapter 10.) You therefore have to send revenue back into your China
accounts if you want to use such accounts to pay bills in China.
Setting up a rep office
The requirements to set up a rep office vary depending on location, but the
procedure tends to be straightforward and transparent. To make things easy,
hire a Chinese company that specializes in business services such as setting
up rep offices. Try searching online to find sponsor service companies, con-
tacting a local foreign chamber of commerce for referrals, or even asking the
local Ministry of Commerce/Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFCOM/COFTEC) branch for names (see “China, may I?
Getting business approvals,” later in this chapter). One relatively large spon-
sor service company in Shanghai is Shanghai Corporate Consulting Co.
(www.haizhixin.com).
In Shanghai and many cities in China, you can also hire the Foreign Enterprise
Service Company (FESCO — discussed shortly) to set up your rep office. If
you hire a service firm, the all-in cost is usually in the ballpark of $1,000 to
$4,000. You need about two to three months to set up.
114
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Many local approval authorities require that a company have at least some
operating history before it can set up a rep office. If you set up a company
overseas and then immediately try to set up your rep office in China, you
may be rejected. Also, rep offices don’t have limited liability — the company
establishing the office is liable for its debts and liabilities. Finally, a rep
office’s business should stay within the parent company’s scope of business
in its home-country incorporation documents.
Hiring through employment service companies
Because rep offices can’t directly do business in China, they can’t directly hire
Chinese employees. Instead, rep offices need to use government appointed
employment service companies, such as the Foreign Enterprise Service
Company (FESCO) or the China International Intellectech Corporation (CIIC).
Each company has its own standard form of labor supply contract, which is
negotiable to some extent. Even when you directly recruit your Chinese
employees (including those who have permanent foreign residence), they
technically need to work for this type of company. You still determine the
terms of employment, though.
You can hire foreign employees without going through an employment serv-
ice company. They can usually sign employment contracts with either your
foreign parent or local rep office.
Looking at rep office taxes
The weirdest aspect of the indirect business feature of rep offices is taxation.
Because rep offices technically aren’t doing business in China, they shouldn’t
have profits or taxable income, right? Nope — the Chinese know that a for-
eign investor must have a rep office for a reason.
In most cases, the government taxes rep offices on “deemed profits.” In most
locations, that means that a rep office pays taxes of about 10 percent of its
business expenses. If the rep office keeps accurate records of income and
expenses, it may be able to qualify for taxes based on actual profits. In iso-
lated cases, rep office taxes may be lower in some special economic zones
(SEZs). You should hire a local accounting firm to assist your rep office with
accounting and tax matters. For more on taxes, see Chapter 10.
Foreign-invested enterprises
Any company that’s at least 25 percent owned by foreign investors is consid-
ered a foreign-invested enterprise (FIE). The FIE distinction is important
because the government tries to guide where and how FIEs invest, meaning
that FIEs may receive additional incentives in some industries; they may be
prohibited from investing in others.
115
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

With FIEs, you have a few decisions to make:
 What kind of FIE is better for your business: wholly foreign-owned 
enterprise (WFOE) or joint venture (JV)?
 If you choose joint venture, what kind of joint venture is better in your
circumstances: equity JV (EJV) or cooperative JV (CJV)?
 What type of incorporation do you want: limited liability company (LLC)
or joint stock company?
If you’re feeling a little confused right now, don’t worry. We step you through
your FIE options in this section.
Choosing a wholly foreign-owned enterprise
An FIE that’s owned only by one or more foreign investors is called a wholly
foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE, although you sometimes see it as WOFE).
WFOE is usually pronounced woofie. Having a WFOE ensures that you main-
tain control of management and can more closely guard intellectual property.
When China first opened up to foreign investment in the 1980s, WFOEs
weren’t permitted. WFOEs were created in the 1990s, and then they could
operate only in a few industries. The government has since opened up many
more industries to WFOE investors. Many investors aren’t willing to accept
the trade-offs of JVs — particularly regarding control and cultural issues. As a
result, many foreign investors are looking to buy out their JV partners and
convert to WFOEs, especially when they’ve operated in China long enough to
feel comfortable about proceeding without their partners’ relationships and
knowledge.
Choosing a joint venture
A joint venture (JV) is a company that your company (or you) co-owns with
another company (or person). In this book, when we discuss JVs, we’re refer-
ring to Sino-foreign JVs, in which at least one Chinese party owns registered
capital.
Having a JV with a Chinese party presents a number of pros and cons. On the
positive side, a JV can give you established sales channels, a trained work-
force, and facilities (such as a factory or land). Your JV partner may also be
able to walk you through the approvals, making it faster to get the operation
off the ground than it would be with a WFOE. On the other hand, a JV means
that you won’t necessarily have management control of the business. Having a
JV may also increase the risk that you’ll lose control of intellectual property
(IP). In the end, though, you may have no choice but to form a JV. Some indus-
tries require foreign investors to form JVs with Chinese companies in order to
do business (see the upcoming section titled “Checking out the catalog”).
116
Part II: Starting Up in China 

You see two types of JV in China:
 Equity JV (EJV): EJVs are fairly straightforward. Each party receives a
share of the profits and risks in proportion to the amount of registered
capital it owns. Board representation doesn’t have to be proportional to
capital, but by law the minority shareholder is usually entitled to at least
one seat.
 Cooperative JV (CJV): The CJV allows the parties to set the benefits in a
way that’s not proportional to their ownership of registered capital.
People generally use CJVs in businesses in which one party receives
most or all the profits from the business’s operations for a certain
period; at the end of the term, the other party receives most or all the
assets. This type of arrangement has been most popular in infrastruc-
ture and real estate projects.
Forming a JV: Contracts and Chinese law
To form a JV, you and your partner(s) need to sign a JV contract. A well-
written JV contract has no substitute, though the contract still follows a 
relatively standard “approvable” JV contract template that many Western
lawyers may consider sparse.
Make sure the Articles of Association (AOA) are written in a way that reflects
your understanding of the agreement and does not contradict the JV contract;
if the two conflict, the JV contract is binding. The AOA is the foundational
document of all Chinese corporations (see the upcoming “Incorporating your
FIE: Limited liability companies” section). In other countries, it’s commonly
called the charter or the constitution. You almost certainly want a lawyer to
help you with the contract and the AOA. See Chapter 4 for more on selecting
attorneys and other service providers.
If you set up a CJV, your CJV contract needs to discuss who owns what assets
at expiration of the JV — again, that’s because a CJV’s benefits and risks may
differ from the parties’ shares of the registered capital.
Include an arbitration clause in the JV contract. Having a properly written
arbitration clause means that any dispute will be settled by an arbitration
panel instead of by Chinese court. Depending on the arbitration body
selected, this move should decrease the chances of favoritism and hopefully
guarantee that a capable body will hear the dispute. For more on arbitration
clauses and arbitration bodies, see Chapters 17 and 18.
Chinese law is very protective of minority shareholders, so don’t waste time
and energy arguing over whether your company will have a majority versus
supermajority of board seats. Most critical decisions require unanimity, so a
supermajority often doesn’t mean anything. In fact, you may want to pause
before getting into a heated discussion about having a majority versus minor-
ity of control. As a minority shareholder, you can veto a lot.
117
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

In almost all cases, the law requires that your local partner have at least one
seat on the board, regardless of how small its share is. Therefore, your part-
ner will have the legal right to veto certain major decisions. These rights
include amending the AOA, terminating the JV, increasing or reducing the
JV’s registered capital, and merging or selling the JV.
As a result, JVs sometimes go into deadlock, which may prevent them from
continuing to operate. If that happens, you may have to go to court in order to
wind up the business. You can address some of these issues in the AOA and JV
contract. Also, JV partners may delay your sale of all or part of your interest
onshore because Chinese law gives the partner a right of first refusal — a 
provision that gives your partner the potential to abuse this right.

Part II: Starting Up in China 
Three barriers to Chinese-foreign cooperation
Rick Wang is the CEO of RetailCo, Inc. (www.
retailcoinc.com), a company that spe-
cializes in apparel and food and beverage 
retailing. Through his work in franchising, he’s
identified what he calls the three barriers that
affect Western and Chinese cooperation in
business. They apply to JVs, franchising, and
many other forms of long-term arrangements. 
If both sides don’t fully get past those barriers,
then your relationship will likely sour eventually.
In a JV, bad partner relations cost money.
Carefully consider whether you and the Chinese
side can surmount the barriers:
 Mind: The barrier of the mind is a question
of commitment to the relationship. You have
to be willing to transfer money, valuable
know-how, and skills. The Chinese side also
needs to understand that the assets and
workers it pledges to the JV will belong to
the JV. The Chinese side has to commit to
putting as much effort into the JV as it puts
into its wholly-owned businesses.
 Trust: To be successful, both sides must
truly trust one another. On the Western side,
you hear stories about unscrupulous JV
partners all the time, which can make
Chinese partners seem guilty until proven
innocent. Of course, good partners rarely
make news. Chinese investors need to trust
that you won’t push them aside as soon as
the business is off the ground and you’re
comfortable in China. Take your time to
decide whether to JV and who your partner
will be; then place a lot of trust in them. If
you don’t, your lack of trust will show; and,
if you can’t, don’t JV.
 Discipline: The barrier of discipline is more
of an issue on the Chinese side. It refers to
the Chinese propensity to search for ways
to do things more quickly, cheaply, easily,
and so on. In many respects, China doesn’t
place the emphasis on quality that Western
countries do, so there’s a real tendency to
“cha bu duo” things, a term that literally
means more or less. This tendency is a
problem when you’re contributing technical
and management know-how to the venture.
You may discover the Chinese side has
broken from your system. When you point
out the changes, don’t be surprised if they
tell you their way is cha bu duo what you
taught them. You need to help them get past
this barrier by insisting at the beginning that
if you’re contributing technical expertise
and management know-how, they stick to it.
And if you see the Chinese side cha bu
duoing things, tell them they need to fix the
problem. Of course, you should be open to
suggestions for improvement.

Expiration and termination of JV contracts
When the JV contract is about to expire (or does expire), you and your part-
ner(s) can choose to either extend the JV or wind it up. Either decision needs
approval from the original approval authority (that is, the original
MOFCOM/COFTEC).
After the owners receive approval to liquidate the JV, the JV has to follow
China’s liquidation procedures. These procedures are essentially similar to
those in many other countries. The company has to give notice and time for
creditors to come forward. After satisfying its debts, it may divide the proceeds
and assets among the shareholders. From the time a JV (or other LLC) receives
approval to liquidate, liquidation usually takes several months to fulfill.
If you and your partner(s) decide to terminate the JV early, the winding up
process is the same: Seek approval and then follow the liquidation proce-
dures. Depending on where the JV is located, this approval may be difficult to
obtain. The termination can be a bit of a political issue in that the local gov-
ernment is losing foreign investment and jobs. If one partner wants to liqui-
date but the others don’t, then the partner who wants to liquidate has to
petition the court to order the dissolution and liquidation. Petitioning is not a
fun process, and succeeding may be difficult.
Incorporating your FIE: Limited liability companies
Regardless of whether you choose a joint venture or wholly foreign-owned
enterprise, you can incorporate in China in one of two ways:
 An LLC: Most FIEs in China are set up as limited liability companies
(LLCs). The LLC is similar to the standard form of corporation found in
many countries: Your personal liability is limited to the amount of
money you invest. (Don’t confuse the Chinese LLC with the U.S. LLC,
which is a hybrid of a partnership and a corporation.) The following 
sections discuss the characteristics of LLCs.
 A joint stock company: The joint stock company isn’t common for FIEs
and is fairly technical, so we don’t cover it here. But we do want you to
at least be aware of the option. If you really want to know more, have
your lawyers look at Chinese law texts.
Ownership and registered capital
An LLC doesn’t issue shares — instead, investors own percentages of the
LLC’s registered capital. (Note: “Registered capital owners” is kind of a
mouthful, so we call the investors shareholders, anyway.) Whenever you set
up an LLC, you’re required to contribute some money or assets as registered
capital. Different industries and local governments may require varying
amounts of registered capital. In some cases, the required amount isn’t that
high, say $10,000. In other cases, the required amount may be over $100,000.
You can contribute assets, such as machinery or technology, instead of cash
for part of the contribution.
119
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

The Chinese authorities have to verify the value of assets you contribute.
Fortunately, you don’t have to contribute all your registered capital upfront.
By law, you need to contribute only 20 percent of your capital within 60 days
of receiving your business license (see “China, may I? Getting business
approvals,” later in this chapter, for more on the business license), and then
contribute the remaining 80 percent within two months of receiving the
license. Some localities allow you even more time to make the contributions.
After you make your contributions (in cash or assets), you need to have an
authorized Chinese accounting firm verify to the government that you’ve
made them. The other good news is that as soon as you have your contribu-
tion verified, you’re free to use the contribution however you want — China
has no requirement that you maintain or replenish cash contributed as 
registered capital.
If you don’t make and verify your registered capital contributions, the 
government may eventually force your company to liquidate.
Limited life and government approval
An LLC must have a specified life, such as 30 years. You’re usually not
allowed to set up a company with an indefinite term. An LLC may apply to
extend its term, though. Such applications are usually approved.
Most other major company matters — including establishing, selling or trans-
ferring ownership (even if partial), and winding up — likewise need approval
120
Part II: Starting Up in China 
Planning ahead with offshore holding companies
If you think you may sell your company (or go
public outside of China), you may want to set up
an offshore company to hold your interest in the
FIE. That way, when somebody wants to buy all
or part of your ownership, the buyer can just
buy equity in the holding company. Assuming
that you set up your holding company in one of
the usual places (such as Hong Kong, the
Cayman Islands, or the U.S.), you don’t need to
go through an approval process to sell the hold-
ing company. Otherwise, if you want to sell your
interest in the FIE directly, you have to go
through a somewhat lengthy application and
approval process with the Chinese authorities.
If you consider setting up an offshore holding
company, consult a tax expert who can help you
choose a suitable country — China has tax
treaties with many countries that may affect
your decision.
Note: If you’re going to set up an offshore hold-
ing company and will have a JV, your Chinese
partner may want to own its share at the off-
shore level, too, either directly or through off-
shore companies it controls. The Chinese
government usually doesn’t like this type of
arrangement. Make sure you consult a lawyer
who can determine whether your Chinese part-
ner has received the necessary approvals to
join you offshore. The Chinese government may
revoke the FIE’s foreign exchange license if your
partner doesn’t have the proper approvals.

from the government. Also, because of the approval processes for onshore
transfers, many foreign investors set up foreign holding companies to own
their onshore interests — see the sidebar titled “Planning ahead with off-
shore holding companies” for details.
Decision-making
Board members — not the shareholders — make all the LLC’s decisions. The
company’s charter, called the Articles of Association (AOA), can specify the
board approval requirements for certain decisions (for example, unanimous
approval). Keep in mind that Chinese law requires unanimous approval for
certain major decisions. The law will always trump the AOA! Voting rights
and requirements are a crucial factor in deciding whether to JV.
Getting money out
An LLC can pay dividends to shareholders; however, China does have restric-
tions in place. For one, an LLC can usually pay dividends only if it’s been prof-
itable for that year.
You can also get your money out of an LLC by using licensing/consulting/loan
agreements with offshore companies that you own (see Chapter 10). Another
option is getting money back when you wind up the company.
Expansion
When you register an LLC in China, you have to provide your company’s legal
address. Your company can’t then automatically open up a factory or office
outside the immediate area of your legal address. Your company has to go
through the application procedures to open branches anywhere else you
want to have a presence. This process usually isn’t too complicated, but the
branches can’t have scopes of business that are different from the LLC’s.
If you want to do something outside of the scope of business, you have to set
up a new company (or rep office). When you have multiple companies in
China, they usually each need their own administration. In other words, you
see a good deal of duplication because each company has many of the same
internal functions — human resources, selling, and so on. In certain circum-
stances, you can set up onshore special holding companies that handle these
administrative duties for your various companies, but the legal requirements
make this choice hard for all but very large businesses.
Considering Location Variations
Choosing where to start your business is obviously a crucial decision. In the
end, the type of business you want determines which factors to consider. If
most of your sales are in China, you obviously want to put convenience to
customers at the top of your list. But regardless of where your customers are
located, you need to keep some overarching considerations in mind. Just as
121
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

in any country, you see variations in laws and resources from region to
region. This section discusses some common factors to keep in mind as you
look at various locations.
Many people classify cities in terms of development. First-tier cities are the
large and most-developed cities. Second-tier cities are cities that are roughly
as wealthy as places like Shanghai and Beijing but are smaller, or they’re large
cities that are rapidly catching up to the first-tier cities. Third-tier cities are
smaller cities that are in earlier phases of economic growth and expansion,
and they’re a good deal behind first- and second-tier cities.
Finding good infrastructure
China’s infrastructure is strongest near the coast. However, its major water-
ways (particularly the Yangtze and the Yellow rivers) do provide good outlets
from parts of the interior. The highway system is second only to the U.S.’s in
terms of the number of miles laid. China is also rapidly adding to its road-
ways to make getting to the interior easier.
Railways aren’t the best way of transporting freight because freight trains
share tracks with passenger trains. Passenger trains have the right of way.
Freight trains can take much longer than they should to reach their destina-
tions. China is adding more track, though, to alleviate this problem.
Consider how close you’ll be to suppliers or to customers (see Chapter 13).
Even though infrastructure in certain parts of China is excellent, logistics is
highly fragmented, so shipping can take a lot of time. In this area, the Pearl
River Delta, which has almost every type of manufacturing supplier and 
customer under the sun, is difficult to beat. The Pearl River Delta isn’t an
absolute advantage, though — you may want to set up your business in
another area of the country that specializes in your field.
Locating your labor force
The supply of managerial and technical workers who are qualified (especially
in terms of English ability) to work in FIEs is pretty tight. Finding these
employees in the first-tier economy cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou is easiest.
However, luring this talent away from first-tier cities to second- and third-tier
cities is fairly difficult, even though many such cities are quite prosperous. If
you’re thinking about trying to attract employees away from the first-tier
cities, be prepared to pay hardship premiums. Fortunately, the smaller cities
in the Pearl and Yangtze River deltas, the Bohai Rim in northeastern China,
and Chengdu and Chongqing are developing their own talent bases. The
122
Part II: Starting Up in China 

situation in those cities is rapidly evolving, so it really pays off to do thor-
ough research on the labor supply there before making a move (for more info
on the labor force, see Chapter 9).
Skilled workers (equipment operators and office support) are also in high
demand. Fortunately, they’re less tied to first-tier cities. You can find them in
most growing second- and third-tier cities, especially in the Yangtze and Pearl
deltas. Many companies hire skilled workers from two-year technical schools,
so you may want to look for locations near some technical schools. You may
also be able to get skilled employees who have been laid-off from state-owned
enterprises (SOEs).
You can find unskilled workers almost anywhere you see factories or con-
struction projects, but they’re most concentrated in the Pearl Delta. Western
companies often find unskilled laborers without much of a problem because
they enjoy a reputation for good working conditions and pay.
Seeking government incentives
To find out what local governments have to offer, speak with the officials
there. Incentives can mean big renminbi (RMB) for your business. You 
find incentives for foreign investors most often in special economic zones
(SEZs — see Chapter 10 for details). If you locate in the right SEZ, you can
receive a significant discount on your company’s income taxes. Within some
SEZs are special export processing zones (EPZs). If you locate within EPZs,
your company may enjoy reduced tariffs on imports and exports.
If a local government is really hungry for your investment (either because it’s
relatively big and/or officials are just beginning to attract foreign investment),
they may be willing to provide your business with additional subsidies.
These subsidies can be tax subsidies or ways of defraying some of your com-
pany’s costs — for example, assistance with your factory’s construction
costs. (As we explain later in “Landing your land,” you should stay away from
any incentive that seems like a subsidy to purchase land-use rights!)
If your company is going to receive a decent amount of incentives or subsi-
dies, you may want to see whether the local government will sign an invest-
ment contract with you. This contract should clearly explain all incentives
your company is to receive and give you a way to enforce them. As with JV
contracts, your investment contract should contain a binding arbitration
clause. An attorney experienced in foreign direct investment (FDI) in China
should be able to draft your investment contract.
Incentives are a common fixation. Make sure the location you’re looking 
at takes care of your business’s basic needs before worrying about the 
incentives.
123
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

Looking for experience 
with foreign investors
Whether a local government has experience with foreign investors can be an
important factor for your business. Without experience, the government may
not understand that foreign investors like consistency, transparency, and pre-
dictability. This situation may come out when you ask the government to sign
an investment contract to guarantee your company’s incentives. The govern-
ment may be willing to go along with signing a contract but not realize that
you fully intend that they honor the letter of the contract.
If you suspect that the officials you’re dealing with don’t fully understand
what they’re promising, find a way to make them understand sooner rather
than later. Speak in a way that doesn’t make it obvious you know they don’t
understand. Simple phrases such as “as I’m sure you know . . .” can help.
Of course, the more experience a local government has with foreign
investors, the less likely the government is to give you special incentives.
Perhaps you’d be better off as a bigger fish in a smaller pond by dealing with
a government that doesn’t have many other foreign investors to welcome. If
you do end up dealing with a government that hasn’t done much business
with foreigners, clearly explain your expectations to them.
Touring the Mainland Regions
This section gives you an overview of opportunities, strengths, and chal-
lenges of China’s various regions.
If you’re looking for a specific type of opportunity, you may want to consult
the U.S. Commercial Service China Web site (www.buyusa.gov/china/en).
The site provides comprehensive information on a number of Chinese cities
as well as updated trade leads showing opportunities to participate in vari-
ous projects or businesses. The Chinese government also provides some
provincial and city information at www.fdi.gov.cn. Another way of finding
specific opportunities is to go to any of the many, many industry and regional
trade fairs that take place in China.
Northeastern China
Here we discuss four areas in northeastern China: Manchuria, Tianjin,
Shandong, and Beijing.
124
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Manchuria
Manchuria contains the northeastern-most three provinces in China:
Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Parts of Manchuria are next to North Korea
and Russia. The area has a little over 100 million people, and it’s the heart-
land of China’s heavy industry state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
This area is actually a top development priority for the government, and a lot
of money’s floating around these three provinces for economic development
projects. The governments of the area are emphasizing development of the
information technology, telecommunications, environmental technology,
automobile parts, and tourism industries.
Harbin, which is the capital of Heilongjiang, ranks among China’s top three
cities in academic, scientific, and technological skill, which may make it a
good place for research and development. Dalian, which is in Liaoning, has
the largest deep-water port in northeast China and is one of the largest oil
refinery bases in China. It has a good number of workers who speak Japanese
or Russian.
Tianjin
Tianjin province is between Beijing and the Bohai Bay. It’s at the crossroads of
two major railway lines: Beijing-Shanxi and Beijing-Shanghai. Tianjin’s port has
the biggest container dock in China. Because of Tianjin’s location near Beijing,
it’s a major logistics center. It also attracts a good deal of investment in manu-
facturing — particularly in electronic products and biochemicals. Motorola
and Samsung Electronics are among the biggest investors in the area.
Shandong
Shandong is both a province and a peninsula in northeastern China. Shandong
is China’s third-largest manufacturing base. It also has large mineral and oil
deposits. Qingdao, which is on the southern part of the peninsula, is one of
China’s five major ports and is also a major tourist attraction.
Beijing
Beijing is hosting the 2008 Olympics, and it’s made enormous investments in
infrastructure to prepare for the event.
Beijing is one of four cities in China that enjoy provincial-level status. In addi-
tion to being China’s government capital and home to over 12 million people,
it’s China’s academic capital. Beijing has 475 research centers and over 60
colleges and universities, including the country’s two most prestigious,
Peking University and Tsinghua (pronounced ching-hwa) University. As a
result, Beijing has a very well-educated workforce that provides it with a
solid base for services.
The city also produces large amounts of chemicals, cars and car parts, 
textiles, garments, and appliances.
125
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

The Yangtze River Delta
The Yangtze River Delta includes the provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu.
It also includes Shanghai, which is a provincial-level city. The Yangtze River
Delta is one of China’s two most economically powerful regions.
Zhejiang and Jiangsu are much bigger economically than Anhui (although
Anhui’s capital, Hefei, is developing nicely these days). The most important
cities in Zhejiang and Jiangsu are Nanjing (in Jiangsu), Hangzhou, and Ningbo
(both in Zhejiang). The region has a large heavy manufacturing base but also
excels in high-tech and biotech products. Zhejiang and Jiangsu have excellent
ports, airports, and roads.
Shanghai itself makes up 5 percent of China’s gross domestic product, even
though it contains only 1 percent of the population (although it’s one of the
world’s largest cities at about 18 million people). It’s China’s commercial
center with numerous factories on its outskirts, a port that processes about
25 percent of China’s exports, and numerous Chinese and foreign banks.
Shanghai is easier to do business in and more transparent than most other
parts of China. By the end of the decade, it hopes to become the high tech-
nology center of China.
Shanghai will also host the 2010 World Expo, and it’s investing billions of 
dollars in infrastructure to prepare.
The Pearl River Delta
The Pearl River Delta in Guangdong Province in the south of China is China’s
most prosperous region. It was the first part of the country opened up to for-
eign investment, and it benefited greatly from money and technology from
Hong Kong.
The major commercial cities are Guangzhou (the capital of the province) and
Shenzhen. Zhuhai is a smaller city, but it’s important commercially because it
was one of China’s original special economic zones (SEZs).
The region has several major ports and extensive road networks. However, the
density of people and factories has created some bottlenecks moving people
and goods. The government is working on building more infrastructure.
The Pearl River Delta is China’s technology manufacturing heartland
(although as we mention in the preceding section, Shanghai hopes to wrest
that title away). Unfortunately, the area has paid a high environmental price
for its prosperity. Air pollution from Guangdong factories is even a hot-button
issue in Hong Kong.
126
Part II: Starting Up in China 

The wild, wild west
Some pockets of the west are developing well — in particular, the cities of
Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming are booming. Xi’an is also attracting a lot
of foreign technology investors. If you look at a map, these cities appear to be
more central than western; however, given China’s heavy bias toward coastal
development, almost every inland province can be considered western.
The central government is on a well-publicized drive to develop the west.
With the exception of the few pockets of prosperity we just mentioned, it may
be too early to say whether the west offers much opportunity. In general,
costs should be extremely low, and you should see a lot of incentives.
The underdeveloped parts of the west have a tough time competing with
many coastal areas in business environment transparency, the rule of law,
and infrastructure. But smart people are trying hard to change this situation,
so if you’re willing to take a bigger risk, you may be rewarded.
Weighing Hong Kong’s Offerings
Hong Kong is connected to the mainland, with its border at the southern
Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen in Guangdong province. Hong Kong used to
be the business and investment gateway to China, often serving as a transit
point for mainland-made goods. As China has opened up to foreign direct
investment (FDI), Hong Kong’s role has evolved.
Today, Hong Kong is a major financial and services hub for China as well as
all of East Asia. It’s also the single largest foreign direct investor on the main-
land. Hong Kong has its own vibrant economy, with real estate, banking, and
retail, among other industries, playing major roles. Luckily for you, Hong
Kong may be able to save you time and hassle.
Hong Kong’s special status: The SAR 
(it’s not something you catch)
Until 1997, Hong Kong was a British colony. In 1997, the British returned Hong
Kong to China but only after China pledged to retain Hong Kong’s capitalist
system for at least 50 years. Hong Kong is now officially called the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People’s Republic of China.
Hong Kong has its own quasi-constitution called the Basic Law. Basic Law
provides for a legal system that’s different and much more open than the
mainland’s. Hong Kong has its own laws and courts, currency (the Hong Kong
dollar — see Chapter 10), and customs and immigration policies.
127
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

Although Hong Kong has a lot of autonomy, China is still in charge of all for-
eign affairs and selects part of Hong Kong’s government. Hence, China is one
country with two systems.
In 1999, China also reclaimed Macau, a former Portuguese colony. Macau is a
short ferry ride away from Hong Kong, and it also has a more open system
than the mainland. We don’t otherwise discuss Macau in this book because
aside from a booming gaming industry, it’s not a major business destination.
Perks of investing in Hong Kong
Depending on your business, Hong Kong can be a better base than some-
where on the mainland (see the earlier “Touring the Mainland Regions” 
section). This section explains some of the perks Hong Kong offers.
Open economy, low taxes, and free trade agreements
The biggest advantage is Hong Kong’s open economy. It usually ranks at the
top of the Economic Freedom in the World Report and the Index of Economic
Freedom. In other words, Hong Kong has strong rule of law with little corrup-
tion, low barriers to trade and business, and a strong market-based economy.
Business is undoubtedly more efficient and transparent in Hong Kong than on
the mainland.
128
Part II: Starting Up in China 
Decolonization: The Brits give back to China
Hong Kong consists of two main land masses:
the Kowloon Peninsula, which connects to the
mainland at Shenzhen, and Hong Kong Island,
which is just across Victoria Harbor from the
Kowloon Peninsula. Great Britain received
Hong Kong Island by treaty in 1842 at the end of
the First Opium War. At the conclusion of the
Second Opium War in 1860, China ceded to
Great Britain the part of the Kowloon Peninsula
closest to Hong Kong Island. In 1898, Great
Britain leased the remainder of the Kowloon
Peninsula (called the New Territories), for 99
years.
The Brits were not exactly keen to return Hong
Kong to China. By the 1970s, Hong Kong had
developed a large manufacturing industry, most
of which was based in the New Territories.
Many of Hong Kong’s banks made loans to
finance those businesses and other projects in
the New Territories.
By the 1980s, people started to realize a loom-
ing problem with Britain’s lease on the New
Territories, which was to run out in 1997. The
Chinese clearly weren’t willing to re-lease or
cede the New Territories, and Great Britain real-
ized that partitioning Hong Kong would be dis-
astrous. The two sides compromised in 1984,
with Great Britain agreeing to return all of Hong
Kong and the Chinese agreeing to preserve the
capitalist system for 50 years after the handover.
The handover officially took place at midnight on
July 1, 1997.

CEPA stands for the Closer Economic Partnership Agreement between Hong
Kong, Macau, and the mainland. It’s a free trade agreement between those
three parts of China. Under CEPA, China doesn’t impose duties on imports
from Hong Kong (and vice versa if the products are made in China). This idea
is important if you’re considering an international trading business. Also,
CEPA allows Hong Kong–based companies better and sooner access to some
restricted industries.
Before you rush to incorporate a company in Hong Kong to get around the
mainland’s restrictions on foreign investment, keep in mind that in most
cases, the company has to really be a Hong Kong company. In other words,
Hong Kong residents own a certain minimum percentage of the company or
you have certain minimum levels of Hong Kong residents as employees. It may
also require some operating history in Hong Kong. The bottom line is that
CEPA is one useful way to get around mainland restrictions, but you should
work with an experienced attorney to understand how it can help you.
Hong Kong also has very low corporate and individual tax rates. Its tax agree-
ment with the mainland may also give you creative ways to structure a hybrid
mainland/Hong Kong business to save taxes (see Chapter 10 for more info on
taxes).
English language and workforce training
Hong Kong has a fairly high English proficiency. You can do business with the
government in English — and in much less time than you’d need on the main-
land. And much of Hong Kong’s white-collar workforce is likewise fluent in
English. Hong Kong’s workforce is also better trained in many services,
including marketing, finance, and information technology.
Quality of life
Hong Kong may be easier for most Westerners to live in. The city’s very
clean, modern, and easy to get around. Western goods, services, food, and
entertainment are everywhere. Hong Kong also has a lively social and arts
scene. However, in recent years, many expatriates have been complaining
about the increasing levels of air pollution.
Location
Hong Kong has a great location, especially for regional businesses. Getting
into the heart of China’s southern manufacturing heartland takes only one to
two hours by car, bus, train, or ferry (see Chapter 5). A lot of people com-
mute daily to the mainland from Hong Kong.
Hong Kong also has one of the best (if not the best) airports in the world,
with numerous flights to different parts of the mainland, as well as all over
Asia (and the world). Shanghai is about two and a half hours away by plane,
and Beijing is about three and a half hours. Most Asian countries are within a
five-hour flight of Hong Kong.
129
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

Currency
The Hong Kong dollar, usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, is convertible into
foreign currency, and unlike the Chinese renminbi, there are no restrictions
on remitting money overseas from Hong Kong (see Chapter 10 for details). 
Of course, if you have a rep office in China, your bank account may be in
Hong Kong, anyway, which would provide you with most of these benefits.
Hong Kong hang-ups
Hong Kong has some disadvantages, too. This section goes over some of the
most significant drawbacks.
Cost
The biggest issue with setting up in Hong Kong is cost. Make no mistake:
Hong Kong is expensive! Your Hong Kong employee may have more skills
than your mainland worker, but you have to pay up — white-collar employ-
ees in Hong Kong earn roughly the same salaries that their counterparts in
Western countries do. In most cases, you’d be crazy to manufacture in Hong
Kong instead of the mainland.
Real estate prices are also quite high in Hong Kong — sometimes they’re
comparable to those of New York City. Hong Kong is also one of the world’s
most expensive cities to live in.
Bad Mandarin
Hong Kong’s main language is Cantonese, a dialect spoken in Hong Kong and
Guangdong province. It shares the same written language as Mandarin, but
the two sound nothing alike. Most Hong Kong Chinese speak at least a little
Mandarin, but in many cases, their Mandarin isn’t good enough to do busi-
ness on the mainland (aside from in Guangdong, where they can slide by with
Cantonese). Also, people from Hong Kong and the mainland have some 
cultural differences that can occasionally create tensions between the two.
Classifying Your Company and
Reckoning with Restrictions
Although China is robust with business opportunities, you have to maneuver
through more than a few restrictions. China has reasons for such limits:
 China is still transitioning from a command-type economy, and it still
likes to have a lot of control. This idea is particularly true as China tries
to balance economic development with social stability.
130
Part II: Starting Up in China 

 China is trying to gradually expose its companies to foreign competition.
The government hopes bringing in foreign competition more slowly will
allow Chinese companies to strengthen and be able to compete.
 China considers certain industries to be essential for national security,
so it restricts foreign investment.
At the same time, China is actively looking for foreign investors in a number
of industries, especially export-oriented ones. China also encourages foreign
investment in certain industries because it wants to discover how to do
those businesses or use a particular technology.
This section discusses industry regulations that have to do with your scope
of business. To find out how the Chinese feel about foreign investment in
your industry, consult the foreign investment catalog discussed in the next
section.
Checking out the catalog
Any serious consideration of doing business in China should begin with the
Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries (the foreign invest-
ment catalog). Type the name of the catalog in your search engine or visit
www.fdi.gov.cn/pub/FDI_EN/Laws/law_en_info.jsp?docid=51089
for an unofficial English version of the catalog.
The catalog breaks down industries into three categories:
 Encouraged: You want to be in the encouraged category if possible.
Encouraged companies may receive tax preferences and incentives. The
incentives vary by industry and location, so you have to analyze possi-
ble benefits thoroughly. Most encouraged industries allow WFOEs (see
“Choosing a wholly foreign-owned enterprise,” earlier in this chapter).
 Restricted: When an industry is restricted, foreigners usually may not
own more than a certain percentage of a company in that industry. The
percentages vary, but a 49 percent cap is common.
 Prohibited: As the name suggests, prohibited industries are closed to
foreign investment, regardless of how little registered capital foreign
investors own.
When an industry isn’t listed in the catalog (which is the case with most
industries), it’s generally considered to be permitted — neither encouraged
nor discouraged.
For your application for business approval, you have to submit your Articles
of Association (AOA). The AOA contains your scope of business (see the
upcoming “Getting MOFCOM and the AIC to approve your scope of business”
section).
131
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

Sometimes, you need a thorough study of the catalog (fortunately it’s not
that long) to finesse your company’s business into a more favorable category.
If you’re going for encouraged status, the scope of business needs to match
or include items from the encouraged part of the catalog. If you’re trying to
avoid restricted or prohibited, your scope of business should avoid sounding
too much like the items under the restricted/prohibited sections of the cata-
log. The scope of business is not a mere formality though — your company’s
actual business must be within the scope of business!
Identifying highly regulated industries
The foreign investment catalog (see the preceding section) can be a little con-
fusing because similar-sounding activities in the same industry can be classi-
fied in two wholly different categories (usually as restricted and prohibited).
But this ambiguity can also be your opportunity to get a more favorable 
classification — possibly by making some hopefully small adjustments to
your business model.
Although a number of businesses are restricted or prohibited for one policy
or another, you should know that some industries bring a lot of restrictions:
 Media: As a one-party state, China doesn’t trust foreigners to dissemi-
nate much information. Operating in media (which can include Internet
businesses) can be frustrating because your company is expected to
know what topics are off-limits with little guidance. These limits have
been particularly hard for companies such as Google and Yahoo!, which
have had issues with bloggers posting information that the government
considers sensitive.
 Real estate: Real estate development is often a highly regulated area,
too. In a socialist country, land ownership and use — especially by 
foreigners — is a touchy subject (see the later section titled “Landing
your land”).
 Finance: Another difficult (but not impossible) industry is finance. This
category includes insurance, investments, and banking. Finance is a key
sector in any economy, and China wants to allow its financial institutions
room to develop so they can compete with foreign companies.
Establishing Your Business
We wish we could say that establishing your company will be quick and pain-
less, but we’d be lying. You will get frustrated at times. This section — and
your legal team — can help you out. Remember that finally receiving your
business license will be a fantastic feeling.

China, may I? Getting business approvals
When setting up a limited liability company (LLC) or a rep office, you generally
deal with two main approval authorities: the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM)
and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC) — or their local
branches. The terminology and process is a little different with rep offices than
with LLCs, but the idea is the same in terms of receiving an approval to set up
shop and then registering the business and receiving your business license.
This section mostly discusses getting approval for an FIE LLC from MOFCOM
and SAIC. For certain industries, particularly restricted ones, the approval
process is more complicated and can involve other ministries.
Introducing your friendly neighborhood approval authorities
MOFCOM and SAIC are actually the acronyms for the national-level organs.
Unless you’re making a very large investment or investing in a sensitive
industry, you’ll be dealing with their local branches. Local MOFCOM
branches are often called COFTEC (Commission of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation). SAIC’s local branches are usually referred to as 
[city or province name] AIC (Administration of Industry and Commerce) —
for example, Qingdao AIC.
Keep in mind that local practices at the approval authorities can vary quite a
bit. Different MOFCOM and AIC branches usually use different forms. In addi-
tion, some branches may require certain formalities that others do not. For
example, some branches may want a little more documentation from the
country in which the parent is incorporated.
Find a trustworthy local business services company or attorney where you’re
going to set up. If you’re more comfortable with providers that aren’t local,
that’s fine. Just be ready to have some patience as they run into differences
in local practice that require them to redo some forms and signatures.
Getting your approval certificate from MOFCOM/COFTEC
Here’s how the approval process works:
1. Go to the Administration of Industry (AIC) to do a name search and
get pre-approval for the Chinese name you want to use (see Chapter
16 for a discussion of choosing Chinese names).
Name pre-approval isn’t a lengthy process, though the time varies by
location — it may be a few days or a week or two.
2. Submit your application packet to MOFCOM/COFTEC.
After you receive your pre-approval, you begin the major part of your
application by going to MOFCOM (or COFTEC). You give MOFCOM your
wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE) or joint venture (JV) applica-
tion packet. This packet consists of a number of items, including
133
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

• Information on your directors, shareholders, and finances
• A feasibility study
• The Articles of Association, or AOA (see the next section)
Much of the packet must be in Chinese. Your service company or attor-
ney can provide the proper forms for these documents, although you do
have to supply information.
3. If your company is approved, you receive an approval certificate,
along with a statement of encouraged status, if applicable.
By law, MOFCOM should decide on your application within 90 days of
receiving it. In some locales, the actual time varies. Note that the AIC
still needs to also sign off on your scope of business language, which
may affect your encouraged status (see the next section for details).
According to the letter of Chinese law, you’re also supposed to seek approval
for your project from the State Development and Reform Commission (SDRC)
around the time that you go for MOFCOM approval (the law is unclear as to
the relative timing). Most projects seem not to actually need this approval,
but if your project is subject to central-level MOFCOM approval, you’ll likely
need SDRC approval as well.
Getting MOFCOM and the AIC to approve your scope of business
The Articles of Association (AOA) in your application packet lists your scope
of business. The scope of business must be pretty specific, and both the
Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) and the Administration of Industry and
Commerce (AIC) separately scrutinize it to see whether your proposed
investment is in line with the foreign investment catalog (see the earlier
“Checking out the catalog” section).
In some cases, MOFCOM approves the scope of business as it is, but the AIC
rewrites or rejects it. If this happens, you can’t yet start your business or you
don’t get the status you want.
Size can be a factor in getting the approval you want — a smaller company
may be able to use its nimbleness to find a creative way to do the business it
wants to do while receiving favorable status; a large, famous company is usu-
ally likely to get more deference, though.
Talk with both approval authorities as you write your scope of business. That
way, you can get informal pre-approval of your scope. You can always apply
down the road to change your scope of business.
Your company should never deviate from its approved scope of business.
Doing so can get you in serious trouble with the government: revocation of
your business license.
134
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Getting your business license from the AIC
Assuming your company is approved, you next go to the AIC for your 
business license. You must apply for your business license within 30 days 
of receiving your MOFCOM approval certificate. The business license 
application should include the following:
 An application form
 The AOA
 The MOFCOM approval certificate
 A copy of the parent’s certificate of incorporation
 A letter from a bank attesting to the parent’s good standing
 A list of the FIE’s directors, supervisors, and the general manager
 The name pre-approval notice
 Other documents required by the local AIC
If you wait more than 30 days to apply for your business license, your
approval certificate will automatically become invalid.
If all is in order, the AIC issues your company’s business license within a few
weeks. The date your company receives the business license is its birthday. It
starts the clock running on a number of important timelines, such as your
135
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop
Taking it in the chops
As you go through the approvals process, you’ll
notice that government agencies and private
companies stamp a lot of documents. These
stamps, called chops, usually contain the
agency or company’s name. China is big on
chops — most documents aren’t official until
someone chops them. After your company is
established, you go to a licensed chops maker
to get your own set.
Treat your company’s chops with care. Not only
do they act as an official company endorsement
of a document, but you may not be able to do
some business without them. For instance,
Winston Zhao, the partner-in-charge of Jones
Day’s Shanghai office, tells the story of a foreign
client who owned a manufacturing company in
China. The foreign investor had appointed a
local Chinese person to be the chief represen-
tative of the company. As often is the case, the
chief representative was made the signatory on
the company’s bank accounts. After several
years, the foreign investor wanted to make a
change and fired the chief representative. The
fired individual had access to all the company’s
chops, though, and took them with him on his
way out. The bank wouldn’t change the signa-
tory on the accounts because the company no
longer had its chops — even though the
investor had all the paperwork to prove that it
was the rightful owner of the account!
Eventually, the investor had a to pay a ransom
to get its chops back.

required registered capital contributions (see “Ownership and registered 
capital,” earlier in this chapter). Now you’re ready to start doing business!
Getting post-formation approvals
After you receive your license, you’ve formed your company. Here’s where to
go from there:
 Register with the tax bureau and the Quality and Technology
Supervision Bureau.
 You may need to deal with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
(SAFE, discussed in detail in Chapter 10) and the customs authorities.
 You may need approval from additional approval authorities if you’re
going to do business in certain industries. For example, if you’re going to
set up a coal-mining business, you also need approval from the Ministry
of State Land and Resources and the State Development and Reform
Commission (SDRC).
Landing your land
Land is becoming a hot-button issue in China. The state owns all land in
China, but it sells land-use rights to companies. Land-use rights are basically
long-term leases, usually good at least for several decades.
The central government has become concerned that in order to attract
investment, local governments have been selling land-use on the cheap to
investors. As a result, land use is an area where the law is changing rapidly.
One recent change is that the central government has made clear that it
won’t tolerate any more bargain land sales or land subsidies. Beijing has now
specified minimum land-use right sale prices for most parts of the country.
Local governments aren’t generally happy about Beijing’s increasing regula-
tion of land-use rights sales. However, the central government seems serious
about cracking down in this area, so be skeptical of local governments that
seem willing to give you a discount on the land price or a land subsidy.
Knowing your land-use rights
You need to know about three types of land-use rights:
 Granted: You want granted land-use rights because they’re the only
rights that are transferable to other buyers.
 Allocated: Allocated land-use rights are not transferable, and they’re
typically the type of rights that state-owned enterprises have.
136
Part II: Starting Up in China 

 Collective: You have to worry about collective-use rights only if you’re
purchasing land from a party other than the government. Collective-use
rights are for use only by village or township cooperative enterprises.
They can’t be transferred legally to investors — the government must
first repossess the rights (usually paying compensation to the collective
rights owners). Then it can turn around and grant the rights.
Law requires you to begin building on the land within one year; if you don’t
begin within two years of purchase, you lose your land-use rights!
If you’re getting your land-use rights from the government, you sign a land-
use rights grant contract with the local land bureau. The bureaus usually
have their own contract. Your advisors should be able to tell you whether the
contract is a standard form they’re used to seeing. If it isn’t, you may be able
to use your advisor’s form instead; which form you use is something you
have to negotiate (see Chapter 6 for tips on negotiating).
Considering options to expand
Land options are contracts that allow you to buy land at a fixed (or not-so-
fixed, as we explain later) price in the future. Land options executed between
two private parties are enforceable. However, some investors sign land
options with land bureaus. Usually, this happens when the investor is setting
up a facility and wants the ability to expand if all goes well. In these situa-
tions, investors often purchase land rights for one parcel of land and get an
option on an adjacent parcel.
Whether options signed with land bureaus are enforceable isn’t clear under
Chinese law. Some land bureaus may require you to pay for the option. Don’t
be surprised if the price you’re asked to pay when you exercise your option
is higher than the price agreed to in the option — especially with the pres-
sure on local governments to get full prices for land.
Options are also complicated by the one- and two-year construction require-
ments for the land (see the preceding section) because Chinese officials can
argue that you’ve tied up the land without using it. At best, the area of
options is murky.
Visas: Getting yourself and your 
expatriate employees to China
Fortunately, getting yourself, your expatriate employees, and their families
residence permit visas and working permits isn’t too hard. (Note: Spouses’
residence permits don’t allow spouses to work unless they change the visa
after they find employment.) Here’s how the process works:
137
Chapter 7: Setting Up Shop

1. Your employees take an invitation letter from your company (or your
rep office’s sponsor) to their closest Chinese consulate or embassy
and apply for a single-entry 30-day Z visa (see Chapter 5).
2. Upon arrival, they to go to the nearest police station and complete a
household registration form for themselves and each family member.
This step usually takes no more than ten minutes.
3. They complete a health examination within the 30-day period.
4. They go to the local labor bureau with a copy of your company’s busi-
ness license or rep office registration certificate and some other docu-
ments to receive their employment certificates within 15 days of
entering China.
5. After getting the employment certificate, they go to the local Public
Security Bureau to apply for residence permits.
As soon as employees have residence permits, they can import their per-
sonal belongings. Unfortunately, furniture, home appliances, and electronic
equipment are still subject to duty or tax.

Understanding Government
Relations with Your Business
In This Chapter
 Understanding how the government can work with your business
 Identifying your current and desired government relations
 Reaching out to government officials
 Understanding how the structure can work for your business
 Gaining approvals from government officials
C
hinese government officials can have a lot of clout, especially in foreign
business circles. For instance, the mayor of a good-sized city often plays
a more important role in business than his or her counterpart in Europe or
North America. A Chinese mayor may be able to get the authorities to speed
up the investment approval process or help fix a problem that a foreign
investor is facing.
Also, the Chinese government often plays multiple roles. For example, it can
be an investor and regulator at the same time, blurring the relationship
between business and the government. Therefore, you really need to under-
stand how to deal with Chinese officials.
In this chapter, you find out how the government looks at foreign investment,
which can help your company put government relations into perspective.
The chapter also shows you how to determine which Chinese government
organizations you should get to know. It discusses how you can access gov-
ernment officials, too. And after you’ve managed to get to know officials
better, you discover how you can maximize the benefits of your relationships
with them.
When you work with the government, you also deal with the Chinese
Communist Party. See Chapter 3 for info on government structure and 
the CCP.

Knowing Why You Want to Connect 
with the Chinese Government
The Chinese government’s formal policy is to welcome new foreign invest-
ment with open arms. Under the surface, the reality is sometimes different.
Government officials are under a lot of pressure to give Chinese companies
more attention.
Your Chinese competitors are trying to influence behaviors from government
officials. They’re attempting to strengthen their position and/or weaken
yours. Therefore, you really need to develop and manage key influencers
within the Chinese government. In this section, we explain what the govern-
ment can do for you and point out some resources available to you.
Government relations can be more important in certain industries, including
highly regulated ones, those using newer technologies, or those offering 
nontraditional selling mechanisms. For example, financial services, Internet
companies, and telecommunications companies come under much closer
government scrutiny. If you’re in these industries, you need to spend a lot
more time staying on top of your government relations.
Getting official assistance
The Chinese are trying pretty hard to make investing in China easier for for-
eigners. Here’s how:
 China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) has set up a division called
the Investment Promotion Agency to cater to foreign investors.
 Provincial governments have special services to assist foreign investors.
For instance, Sichuan Province has set up the Sichuan Provincial
Investment Promotion Bureau (SIPB).
 China has created special zones to attract foreign companies through
incentives. For example, the Tianjin Export Processing Zone (TEPZ)
waives import duties on machinery that’ll eventually be used for 
manufacturing products for export from the zone.
 Trade shows and fairs routinely take place throughout the country.
Many Chinese cities even send trade and investment representatives on
missions overseas to drum up new investment.
The largest and most famous Chinese trade fair — the China Import and
Export Fair — has kept going for more than 50 years. Sponsored by the
Chinese government, this so-called Canton Fair is held in Guangzhou in
the south of China twice a year, in spring and the fall.
140
Part II: Starting Up in China

services related to investment, visit www.fdi.gov.cn.
Gaining guidance and support
Often, government officials can guide you well. They can help you set up your
company and keep your business running smoothly. For example, they may
be able to help you get more electricity to keep you going 24 hours a day.
Government officials often have the final say in approving your business ven-
ture or approving your new building site, so cultivating relationships with
officials can help these processes along. In addition, many local governments
also are the decision-makers when giving out incentives to set up shop in
their city.
Don’t let government relations drive your business strategy. Sometimes for-
eign companies get so awestruck about the potential opportunity in China
that they place too much emphasis on what government officials tell them.
But you shouldn’t, for example, choose the location of your factory based
solely on incentives offered by local officials. Don’t get fooled into believing
that government officials can make all your problems go away. Decide for
yourself what’s best for your business.
Some government officials can talk a good game and make certain promises
when they’re courting a foreign company. Before you make any commit-
ments, check around with other foreign companies that recently may or may
not have made an investment there. (Of course, you may not want to contact
your competition while checking around!) That way, you can check the local
government’s reputation before you make any plans.
Mapping the Bureaucracy 
to Plan Your Network
The Chinese bureaucracy is massive. It extends far and wide, with layers
upon layers of officialdom. Smart companies understand that developing a
systematic approach to government and relationship management can make
a difference. It involves getting an understanding of who’s doing what inside
the government. By understanding what government units, and who within
those units, can possibly help you, you’ll have a better chance of getting
ahead with your plans for China and may be able to save your company some
hassles later on. You may even create new opportunities for your company
along the way.
141
Chapter 8: Understanding Government Relations with Your Business

Identifying key government organizations
Getting a handle on what government organizations should be on your radar
screen is an important first step in getting your government relations pro-
gram organized. You need to identify each and every Chinese government
organization you’ll likely be involved with. You want to find out the following:
 Who regulates the industry and at what level in the central government
 How the central ministry relates to the provincial and city level
 Which Chinese government think tanks or government agencies may
influence your business
 Names of other government units involved in the business
 Names of other organizations or specific individuals who may have a say
in your business
 Which government-related organizations from your own country you
should work with
 Which nongovernmental trade or business groups can help you
Embassies, consulates, and export agencies of foreign governments are excel-
lent resources for such information, especially for small- and medium-sized
companies with a limited budget. Many companies supplement the info they
get from their home government agencies or embassies with information they
develop themselves by making contacts within the industry in China. Some
larger companies choose to use external consultants. For more information
about foreign government organizations that may assist you, go to Chapter 4.
When your company begins to hire people locally, your people on the ground
should know which local officials to contact on any approval or permit. So if
you’re expanding your factory, adding workers and needing training permits,
or performing other activities that require government approval, your locally
hired senior plant manager should know whom to call on within the local
government.
Identifying the key influencers
After you identify the government organizations that’ll likely influence your
business, determine who the key players are within those organizations.
Make contacts in China with people who know the structure and who the
players are. You can find such contacts within the following:
 The Chinese government itself as you get to know the officials
 Your industry business circles
 The commercial services provided by your government
142
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Your list of influencers may include many people within the same govern-
ment unit. It may take you across China’s provincial borders as well. Don’t
forget to include key influencers from your own country, such as your ambas-
sador to China and commercial officers at your embassy and/or consulate.
And remember to include other China-related business or trade organiza-
tions, such as the US-China Chamber of Commerce or the Canadian-China
Chamber of Commerce.
For small businesses, you can usually figure out pretty quickly who the key
players are — your list may include no more than local government officials if
you’re investing only in a local area. Although your dealings with the govern-
ment may be minimal, understanding the dynamics of the local government
structure and people is worthwhile. When you work with and get to know the
local officials, you figure out the pecking order and who does what within the
government structure. As your relationship grows, the local officials may
become useful contacts for you.
If your company has more ambitious plans across China, you need relation-
ships with the local government in each and every location where you plan to
do business. Laws and some regulations can vary quite a bit from one place
to another.
Make sure you have more than one relationship inside the government sec-
tion or unit so that if one contact gets promoted, you have someone else in
the department who knows your company.
Government officials move from job to job frequently. Generally, when an offi-
cial leaves a post for another job, any commitments he or she made to you or
your company leaves, too. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself in a posi-
tion of restarting discussions with a new official who has no commitment to
any promises made by his or her predecessor.
Protect yourself through contracts. If, for example, the vice mayor offers you
tax incentives if your company builds a new factory, execute an investment
contract with the local government in which it commits to providing these ben-
efits. For more on investment contracts/agreements, see Chapters 7 and 18.
Tracking key relationships
After you identify the organizations and key players you need to get along-
side, you can begin to track your Chinese relationships. You can do this step
informally instead of creating an actual map, or you can make a graphic rep-
resentation of the government organizations and officials that are or should
be part of your network. This map can be a good visual for your senior execu-
tives so they can better understand the government organization and the
Chinese officials who are key contacts for your organization. Your map will
likely include Chinese organizations such as
143
Chapter 8: Understanding Government Relations with Your Business

 One or more Chinese regulatory commissions
 Several key Chinese ministries
 National, provincial, and local government leaders and their key staff
 Government think tanks
 University research centers
 Embassy and/or consulate government officials
This mapping exercise is especially useful for mid-tier or large companies
that are planning or operating multiple investments in China across multiple
provinces while dealing with multiple governmental organizations. But it can
be easily adapted on a smaller scale for other firms setting up in China.
Here’s how the process works:
1. Identify the Chinese relationships you’ve developed and indicate how
strong these relationships are.
2. Get your China team to agree on who’s responsible to lead the 
relationships.
This person is responsible for nurturing and growing the relationships.
Everyone needs to know who this person is.
3. Look for holes in your Chinese network.
4. Focus on finding and developing these new contacts.
You can leverage your key relationships by using one relationship to
give you access to another official — especially across provincial bor-
ders if they’re strong enough. You may sometimes encounter situations
in which government organizations seem to have overlapping responsi-
bilities. Your map can define where these overlaps occur and help iden-
tify who the right contacts may be to make your deal work out. Your
completed map can guide you to other important government-related
organizations as well.
Get to know the officials’ levels of seniority. By mapping your senior
executives with equivalent-ranking Chinese officials, you can make intro-
ductions at the appropriate level of seniority.
5. Update your map to reflect the frequent organizational changes that
happen within the government.
Updating enables your company to track the transfers of officials from
one government job to the next.
144
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Contact: Working Your Network
Getting access to government officials can be challenging at times, but this
section provides you with several good approaches. You can use one or all of
the suggested methods.
Getting your Chinese employees 
to make connections
Most senior Chinese business executives know the right way to get access to
Chinese government officials. They know how to build a network of relation-
ships that can help support your business activities. They also understand
the right way to go about using Chinese protocol to gain access to certain
officials. Relying on your local senior management team to build the right
relationships is a good approach to bettering your government relations.
Calling in company big shots 
to access senior officials
Sometimes, due to their relative position within the company, your senior
Chinese executives may be unable to gain access to specific government offi-
cials. Chinese companies view hierarchy as very important, so only people at
certain levels can talk formally to the same level of person at another com-
pany or organization. Often, your company can gain access to more senior
Chinese officials by wheeling in your company’s C-level people (CEOs, CFOs,
COOs, and so on).
If you plan to get your company’s C-level executives to meet Chinese officials,
start planning the visit well in advance. We recommended that you start at
least two months ahead of time. And don’t be surprised to get confirmation
of the meeting just weeks or possibly days before the meeting.
If your company executive suite looks more like a revolving door these days,
bringing in your senior executives to help you in China can backfire. The
Chinese value consistency, so you need to have a stable management within
your company for this approach to work.
145
Chapter 8: Understanding Government Relations with Your Business

Depending on your Chinese partner
Assuming your relationship is a good one, consider getting assistance from
your Chinese partner. Visiting your targeted government officials with your
Chinese business partner gives your company more respect in the eyes of the
government officials. You’re showing the government officials that your
Chinese business partner is important to your business.
This approach to government relations works well for firms that are planning
or are involved in joint ventures with the Chinese — especially with China’s
privately owned companies. Using the strengths of your Chinese partner’s
relationships, you get the benefit of their political connections. This perk is
especially useful when you’re attempting to get approvals from government
officials. (Again, this method works only when your joint venture is a real
partnership and the relationship is going well.) Usually, the foreign company
complements the relationship with technical expertise, and the Chinese com-
pany has the local market operating knowledge and relationships to make
business deals happen.
Although your Chinese partner may have the relationships to get an approval,
they may be in a rush to get the paperwork done at the expense of getting the
details right. So be sure to stay engaged in the process so that any paperwork
submitted to the authorities reflects what’s best for your company. For exam-
ple, you want to make sure you’re submitting a proper description of your
company’s proposed scope of business activity (see Chapter 7).
Using the relationships that your partner has with officials can be advanta-
geous, but it’s important that you build your own government relations, too.
You want some insurance in case something goes wrong with your Chinese
partner.
146
Part II: Starting Up in China 
Connecting executives with your Chinese network
Get your company’s senior executives directly
involved in the government relations process so
they can understand how things really work in
China. Sometimes, senior executives presume
that if something can’t be done, it’s because
your China team doesn’t know how to do it.
Some executives at your headquarters may
challenge you on the amount of effort that’s
being put into government relationships.
Developing government contacts at the local
(never mind provincial or national) level takes a
lot of time and effort. This idea is especially true
for your local senior Chinese executives, who
may need to spend considerable time network-
ing with Chinese officials. And then your busi-
ness has to deal with the additional time 
and expense of sending company executives
from headquarters. They, too, should be actively
engaged in developing relationships with
Chinese government officials.

Turning to consultants
Some firms use business consultants, retired Chinese officials, or retired
diplomatic personnel to get an audience with certain officials. Consultants
may have not only some strong relationships in government circles but also
deep insights in a particular industry. You may use consultants successfully if
they truly have key relationships and can deliver on their promises. (For
more on consultants, go to Chapter 4.)
Although many people see this approach as a good option, it’s not the pre-
ferred method for most businesses. The best way forward is for your company
to build your own government relationships (or build them in conjunction
with your Chinese partner). After all, your company should be capable of
developing, managing, and controlling its own network of business and gov-
ernment contacts. Your firm can reap the benefits directly this way instead of
relying on some middleman to make it all happen. (For more on building rela-
tionships in China, go to Chapter 15.)
Plenty of consultants in China promise to introduce your company to the
most connected government contacts. The best advice is to go very slowly
with people making such a promise. Just be sure to check out any local con-
sultant’s background, references, and success with other companies.
Aligning Your Government Relationships
One of the most challenging notions for foreign companies to grasp is the
need to manage your network of government relationships. For small compa-
nies, it’s pretty easy to manage. For mid-tier and larger companies, this is no
easy task. But don’t get too hung up on the complexities of it all. This section
can help you understand the way you need to operate at certain levels within
government circles.
Taking the bottom-up approach 
for smaller firms
For a small foreign company that’s likely operating in one location, take a
bottom-up approach to developing relationships with government officials.
You’ll likely be working with more junior people in the government ranks
when you first get started in China. Over time, you eventually want to make
connections to the highest level of the local government. Usually, this highest
level is the mayor of the city or town where you’re establishing your business.
Meeting the local officials and getting alongside them is the right thing to do.
147
Chapter 8: Understanding Government Relations with Your Business

You’re likely not obliged to follow the formal protocols you’d likely find at the
higher levels of the Chinese government, so be sure your team on the ground
makes an effort to socialize with these contacts outside of the usual business
activities. This activity may be banqueting or a night out drinking with your
Chinese government contacts. In some places in China today, it may even be
a round of golf.
Meeting in the middle: Managing 
multiple levels of government
If you’re a medium- or large-scale company doing business in China in more
than one geographic area, you’ll likely be managing multiple levels of relation-
ships with government officials. You need to have the right government sup-
port in the geographic area where you plan to operate. You may need
assistance at the national, provincial, city, or even township level.
The big picture for your company in China may look something like this: Your
business is regulated by a central ministry in Beijing that exerts considerable
power over national policy in your industry. The ministry is influenced by the
government’s leading think tank that reports to the State Council. The regula-
tory officials also have local representation in the province and city where you
operate your local businesses. Your biggest Chinese competitor has good gov-
ernment contacts at the national level. Your nimblest local competitor is tight
with the provincial governmental leadership. But another Chinese government
institution — yet another government-supported think tank — also advises the
regulatory commission for your industry in Beijing. It so happens that your
biggest foreign competitors are trying to influence industry developments with
this think tank by financially supporting an independent study of regulation of
the industry. As you can see, your company and your competitors can be quite
active within many different levels of the Chinese government.
Joining the top to the bottom
If you have to deal with multiple levels of government, a good approach is to
make the top meet the bottom. This idea doesn’t mean that that senior offi-
cials from one level of government need to meet other officials. What it
means is that you may need to connect your network of government officials
in a way that maximizes your chances to push through an approval. Pull the
right government levers by using upper-level connections to help you while
respecting the position of more local government officials. After all, local gov-
ernment officials don’t necessarily like being told what to do — especially if it
reduces their influence or power. Therefore, you need to strike a balance by
managing the mandate coming from the top officials with the need to stay
onsides and work with the local government officials. This idea is especially
true when your company is seeking approvals from government officials that
cross geographic boundaries in China.
148
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Make as many contacts as possible so you can cover the wide base of relation-
ships that you may need to call upon to get the job done. The more-senior
government contacts your company knows may have some influence over
provincial and other local officials, but even senior officials from the central
government can’t get everything lined up for your company at the provincial
or local level. And often the provincial and local government leaders can’t get
things completely organized for you up the government chain of command.
Lining up the levels
One of the most important activities for foreign companies operating across
China is to align the interests of both the local government and the provincial
or central government. The trick is to serve all these masters well.
Your local team can extend your Chinese network to reach the right relation-
ships with multiple levels of government officials — from local and provincial
leaders and possibly national, too. That way, your company can make contacts
and gain influence not only up and down but across the Chinese government
structures that manage, regulate, or impact your industry. Without having the
right relationships in place at various levels in the Chinese government, you’ll
find that getting things done across provincial borders is much more difficult.
Getting a strong recommendation from one government official can help your
company build relationships with other key influencers in China. Build trust
with government officials so they have no hesitation in recommending you or
your company to others. (For more about building trust, see the following
section.) Connecting one government official who really knows and trusts
your company to a new government contact can help smooth the way with
new government officials, who may have some lingering doubts about your
firm or its dealings.
Getting Government Approvals
Getting business approvals in China can be quite a painful process for many
companies. Approvals seem to take forever. Sometimes, you wait for long
periods of time, only to hear a refusal. You can help your company get the
approvals it needs by working very closely with government officials.
Forward-thinking government officials in some cities, such as Suzhou and
Shunde, are making it easier for foreign investors to weave their way through
the system. The concept is all about one-stop services that the local govern-
ment provides to investors. The government coordinates approval, registra-
tion, permits, and more for foreign investors.
149
Chapter 8: Understanding Government Relations with Your Business

Earning your approvals
Contrary to what some people think, getting approvals in China is not about
asking government officials for favors. Getting approvals in China just doesn’t
work that way. Your company needs to get approvals the old-fashioned way:
by earning it from the Chinese authorities.
Some officials may expect compensation for helping your company in China.
This compensation can take many forms, from outright bribes to paying for
foreign travel to finding a family member a job. Unfortunately, some officials
may ask for these incentives in exchange for a favor. Stay clear of any shady
business dealings. If you engage in corrupt activities in China, not only are
you violating Chinese law, but you may be violating your home country laws,
too. For more information on how your country’s laws may prohibit corrupt
behavior in China, see Chapter 17.
Making your case
Create an opportunity for the government authorities to give you the approval.
You have to demonstrate the economic value that the deal represents to them.
Show them that by approving your deal, the government has more to gain than
to lose. (Of course, they’ll understand how your company benefits, too.)
Some foreign companies seem to lose sight of or don’t fully understand why
they’re allowed to be in China in the first place. You’re allowed in because
your success can help China succeed. Demonstrate that you’re really helping
the government grow the local economy and transferring technology and
good management practices. Remember the following as you make your case:
 You’re reducing unemployment by creating jobs for Chinese people.
Your company is probably going to help with job losses for displaced
government workers.
 You’re transferring management and technology know-how that helps
Chinese companies grow their businesses.
 You’re generating new recurring revenue for the local government
through business tax, real estate tax, and value-added tax. In turn, the
government can invest these monies in education, health, the environ-
ment, and more.
The tricky part is convincing officials how much is in it for the city or province
for which they’re responsible. The key is getting the message right so the offi-
cials clearly understand the value your proposal delivers. Spell out the bene-
fits, whether it’s increasing the number of jobs, guaranteeing pension benefits,
keeping a factory up and running, or building a new factory. Offering the gov-
ernment the right mix of economic benefits is one of the best ways to get the
approvals your business needs.
150
Part II: Starting Up in China 

When dealing with the Chinese government officials, keep them informed
about what your company brings to China. A friendly mention to government
officials from time to time is appropriate. Tell them about the number of jobs
your company has created for the local community or the total investment
dollars you’ve committed to the area. Or mention the number of suppliers
your company is supporting locally.
More than just money is involved here. The Chinese officials have seen with
their own eyes what modern management practices can do to drive economic
development. They only need to visit the former fishing village of Shenzhen to
witness the dramatic improvement in the quality of life. Local government offi-
cials want the same. They want the best practice in areas such as quality con-
trol, logistics, financial controls, and so on. They want knowledge transferred
to your Chinese employees so they can put it to good use in the future (in the
minds of officials, hopefully with a Chinese company).
Helping the process along
Sometimes, government officials and workers are so overwhelmed that they
may not know how to present support for a particular initiative that they
want to endorse. As you get to know them well, don’t be shy about asking
them whether you can do anything to help. For example, you can offer to pro-
vide additional technical information in support of the initiative that may
also lighten their workload.
Probably a gazillion proposals, approvals, and permits are in your local gov-
ernment officials’ in-tray, so follow up on the status of your approval on a reg-
ular basis by checking in with your government contacts. If you don’t play
the game by staying in close contact, you’ll probably wait months or more for
the answer you’re looking for.
Unblocking the blockers
When you’re dealing with government approvals, you may find out through
other channels that some government officials don’t support your proposal.
Perhaps other government officials have a vested interest in keeping the
status quo. Maybe a Chinese company has a strong influence on a particu-
larly strong government official. Or maybe an official is worried about losing
his or her power base. Whatever the situation is, you can generally expect to
have both supporters and blockers in the government.
Almost anybody in the Chinese government hierarchy can break up a busi-
ness deal or an important project at any time and without any warning.
Power plays between government officials, blocking and tackling by Chinese
competitors, and other not-so-obvious reasons can get in the way. By engag-
ing multiple levels of government and aligning with their interests (see
151
Chapter 8: Understanding Government Relations with Your Business

“Aligning Your Government Relationships,” earlier in this chapter), you can
get some assurance that a potential deal-breaker won’t get in the way. Make
sure you secure as many supporters as possible within your government net-
work to promote your company’s point of view. Hopefully, your supporters
can counterbalance any blockers you bump into along the way.
Your unblocking strategy should focus on breaking down the objections into
smaller parts to focus on key areas of concern. You’ll likely find out what’s
worrying the Chinese the most. Sometimes, you discover that what worries
the government officials doesn’t worry you! For example, the government
may be worried about guaranteeing pensions for workers in a takeover of a
Chinese company; meanwhile, your company already has enough funds set
aside. Hopefully, by breaking things down this way, you can find a way for-
ward. At this point, unblocking is more like negotiating than anything else.
Sometimes, however, you find that for whatever reason, your unblocking
activities fail to produce the desired results. Don’t be surprised if you never
find out the real reason for a rejection.
Gaining trust by keeping your word
Chinese officials constantly worry about the possibility of losing face if they
make a misstep. (For more about face, go to Chapter 11.) They worry
because they think they may have sold a state asset at a price that’s too low.
They fret because they don’t want to be seen giving your company too much
of a competitive advantage. They’re concerned that your company is getting
access to distribution at the expense of the Chinese companies. You need to
reassure the government official that you’re not going to take advantage of
any dealings with him or her.
Never put a Chinese government official in an embarrassing situation. And
don’t even think about taking advantage of a government official, even if it
may result in greater profits. Your relationship and the support of govern-
ment officials are worth more than any short-term gains.
Educating officials (without telling them)
Clever foreign businesspeople make government officials look smart. One
way to do so is to informally educate Chinese officials by providing them with
valuable new insights about your industry. This technique gives you an
opportunity to sell your ideas. It may expose officials to new ideas and cause
officials to call those ideas their own. This method can be especially useful
for medium to large foreign companies that are in highly regulated industries
or restricted businesses.
152
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Many approvals that were previously done at higher levels in the Chinese
government have now been delegated to local officials in many cities or even
towns. Many more local officials are now responsible for making decisions on
foreign investment. Some officials aren’t well equipped to handle their new
assignment. They can actually go silent on you when asked to approve a legit-
imate proposal. Consider this an opportunity to be proactive by educating
them in a professional way. You can give them confidence by guiding them
with your knowledge. This technique is great for making friends with and
positively influencing Chinese officials.
If you want your Chinese regulatory contacts to find out how other countries
go about regulatory matters in your industry, your company can introduce a
subject-matter expert. Such an introduction can give the Chinese a different
frame of reference on a particular topic of interest. By providing assistance to
Chinese officials on matters of concern, you can get some credit for helping
them out.
Be mindful in the way you educate Chinese officials — especially in regula-
tory matters. You don’t want to be seen as influencing government officials in
the wrong way. Use careful judgment before going down this path.
Also, share your company’s mission statement with Chinese government offi-
cials, especially when dealing with regulators. It helps them better under-
stand your company and its plans for China, and it gives them a consistent
message about your company’s goals in China.
Be careful not to overstate your future China plans in front of government
officials. For example, don’t make any broad statements about plans to build
a factory unless you’re 100 percent sure it’ll happen. You don’t want the gov-
ernment officials to misunderstand your intentions. They’ll likely hold your
feet to the fire later on for not doing what you said you were going to do. (For
more about sending a consistent message to the Chinese, go to Chapter 11).
Post-approval: Practicing 
public relations in China
When it comes to getting attention in the media, the Chinese —especially
Chinese officials — usually run for cover. So check in with your government
contacts on how they’d like to make a public announcement. Usually, if your
company’s to release any written announcement, the protocol is that the
Chinese will develop an appropriate statement.
153
Chapter 8: Understanding Government Relations with Your Business

Avoid any publicity for your business that involves the government — unless
the idea comes from their side. Generally, shy away from any publicity that
may involve government officials, especially with new ventures. Chinese offi-
cials are generally unsure how a new deal will eventually work out. As a
result, they don’t want to make any mention of it. In their minds, there’s more
to be lost than gained.
You can give officials some credit for their support without using any public-
ity. Consider giving government officials small symbols of recognition for
their contribution, such as acrylic award plaques.
154
Part II: Starting Up in China 
Paying it forward: Helping the government 
get new investors
Not only is making government officials look
good a smart way to build relationships, but it’s
also a great way of paying back the government
for their continued support. Show your appreci-
ation by becoming a reference for the local
Chinese government officials. You can offer to
speak to potential foreign investors visiting
China (or in your home country) to inform them
of your positive dealings with the local govern-
ment officials.
Another way to show appreciation for their sup-
port is to invite them to visit your country and
create an opportunity for the government offi-
cials to pitch for new investment. For instance,
your company can arrange an investment sem-
inar for local companies that are interested in
doing business in China. The Chinese pay for
their airfare and accommodations; you arrange
the venue and guests for the seminar.
You can hold a reception for the visiting officials
as well and introduce them to your local busi-
ness and government contacts. And you can
show them around town for a little sightseeing
and entertain them along the way.

You have to walk a lot of tightropes with personnel matters in China.
Because of the small number of qualified candidates, you need to screen
potential hires hard but do a great job selling them on your company at the
same time. Because of cultural issues, you have to make sure employees
respect you as the boss without squelching free thinking. You ultimately have
to develop your own sense of how to balance, but this chapter can help you
get there a lot sooner.
Looking at Employees and the Law
Because China is still a communist country, it doesn’t offer employers the
most flexible legal system for dealing with employees.
Under the current legal framework, local labor bureaus have a lot of power to
enact and interpret employment laws and regulations. The government did
enact a national labor law in 1994, but it leaves a lot of blanks for local gov-
ernments to fill in. However, at the time of publication of this book, the
Chinese government was circulating portions of various draft versions of a
new national labor law. As the government received comments from busi-
nesses and employee groups, it did a good deal of redrafting. In general,
although the new law should standardize some practices, many labor issues
and interpretation of parts of the law will likely remain local.

This section discusses the current state of the law. We also mention some
changes to the existing law that have been part of recent drafts. Keep in mind
that these changes may be different when the law is finalized, so use the 
discussions on the draft law just to get a sense of the legal trends.
Employment law is changing rapidly and is oriented very locally, so don’t hire
employees without first seeking legal advice.
Employment contracts
Expatriates may sign employment contracts with the FIE’s parent and then 
be seconded to the FIE, or they may contract directly with the FIE.
People’s Republic of China (PRC) employees are Chinese nationals who are
hired locally. For them, the current national labor law requires that seven
items be specified in employment contracts:
 Term
 Job requirements and duties
 Salary and benefits
 Termination provisions
 Consequences of a breach of contract
 Behavior and discipline standards
 Working conditions
You can add other provisions, such as a probation period, to employment con-
tracts, too. We discuss each of these components in the following sections.
A contract must be written in Chinese in order to be valid and binding. An
employment contract can have multiple language versions, but only the
Chinese version is official.
Term
You can create two basic types of employment contracts in China — open-
term and fixed-term:
 An open-term contract doesn’t have an ending date — it’s for an indefinite
period.
 A fixed-term contract can be for a certain amount of time (for example,
one year) or for a particular assignment or project (for example, 
upgrading the computer network).
156
Part II: Starting Up in China 

As we discuss shortly, getting rid of employees after their probationary peri-
ods can be difficult. One advantage of a fixed-term contract is that when it
expires, the employer can let go of the employee without a problem. On the
other hand, as long as the economy continues to boom, keeping good work-
ers is going to be hard. A fixed-term contract obligates good employees to
stay for a certain period of time. Most commonly, employers use one-year
fixed-term contracts with their PRC employees.
In one version of the proposed draft law, if you continue to employ somebody
after his or her fixed-term contract expires — even without signing a new
contract — the employee will be considered to have an open-term contract.
Another proposed change in the draft law says that employees without writ-
ten contracts will be considered to have open-term agreements.
Job requirements
Be careful when describing the job requirements and the employee’s 
duties in the contract. If your description is too broad, then arguing that an
employee wasn’t doing his or her job properly may be difficult (see “Legal
disputes,” later in this chapter). If you go too narrow and later try to change
the employee’s duties, you’ll have to get him or her to sign a new or amended
contract. The job description has no magic formula — you have to decide
which side you’d rather risk erring on.
Depending on locale, you may be able to give yourself flexibility with a clause
that specifically allows you to change the duties and requirements as necessary.
Salary and benefits
China currently has no national minimum wage (although that may change
under the new labor law). However, most local governments have put mini-
mum wages in place. Table 9-1 shows minimum monthly wages for full-time
workers in some major cities (to convert to your home currency, visit
finance.yahoo.com/currency).

157
Chapter 9: Building a Local Team in China

In addition to wages, you have to pay into at least some social welfare funds
for all PRC employees. Social welfare funds usually cover
 Basic health insurance
 Unemployment insurance
 A housing savings plan
 Pension
The amounts you need to pay into the funds vary by the domicile of your
employees. Domicile, or hukou (pronounced who-koh), is where a person is
officially registered. It determines eligibility for social services and other ben-
efits. It isn’t the same thing as residency — a person can live in Beijing but
have hukou in Xi’an because he or she was born there. Switching hukou is 
difficult.
For employees who have hukou in the city where your company is located,
the required contributions to their funds are higher than for employees
whose hukou is elsewhere. A number of factors determine the difference in
required hukou contributions, but outside hukou contributions may be about
half of what local hukou requirements are. There’s a somewhat complicated
formula for determining the social welfare fund contribution amounts, but in
first-tier cities such as Beijing, it may be approximately 45 percent for
employees with local hukou.
Termination provisions
The termination provisions you should list in the contract are
 How many days’ notice each side must give of termination
 The allowable grounds for termination
This area is usually governed more by local law than national. Regardless of
what the contract says, after the worker has finished the probationary
period, terminating an employee without paying compensation is usually dif-
ficult (see “Legal disputes,” later in this chapter).
Consequences of breach of contract
You can specify consequences for breaching the contract — for example, fail-
ing to give sufficient notice of leaving, terminating the contract early, or
breaching a non-compete or non-solicitation clause (which we discuss later).
Some companies that invest significant money in training employees insert
provisions that require an employee who terminates a contract early to 
reimburse the company for some or all the expenses.
158
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Local law may limit how much you can actually get from an employee for
breach, and some draft versions of the proposed national labor law also con-
tain limits on employer compensation. Regardless of whether the law limits
the amount you can get, as a practical matter, your compensation is likely to
be limited. Arbitration panels and courts often look at the employee’s ability
to pay, not damage to the employer.
Many companies don’t include requirements that breaching employees pay
compensation (aside from when breaching non-compete or non-solicitation
clauses). The labor market’s tight, and this type of provision can scare off
potential employees.
Behavior and discipline standards
Usually, the behavior and discipline section is just boilerplate language read-
ing that employees will comply with all lawful company rules and policies
and that those who violate the rules and policies will be disciplined accord-
ing to company procedures.
Working conditions
The working conditions clause is usually just boilerplate language reading
that the employer will provide a working environment that complies with
applicable laws.
Non-compete and non-solicitation clauses
For employees who deal with sensitive information and valuable clients,
include a non-competition or non-compete clause in your contracts; such a
clause limits their ability to use that information or those relationships to
benefit a competitor. This clause works by requiring that an employee not
join or start a business in the same field within a defined geographic area
(such as Beijing) for a set period of time (for example, two years) after he or
she leaves your company. Non-competition clauses usually also include non-
solicitation clauses, which prohibit former employees from actively seeking
out your customers and employees (whether for a competing or non-
competing business).
In China, an employer must pay separate consideration (aside from the
salary) to have an effective non-compete clause. This consideration varies by
locale where the contract was signed, but it’s usually fairly high. Generally,
the law does not restrict how broad a geographic area the non-compete can
cover. In other words, whether the former employee is in a different city
shouldn’t matter.
159
Chapter 9: Building a Local Team in China

The national law specifies that non-competes may be no longer than three
years (one version of the draft law would shorten that to two), but some
locales have laws that allow for longer non-competes. Many arbitration
panels and courts will look at whether a non-compete is reasonable under
the circumstances.
If you take action against a former employee for breaching a non-competition
clause, you have to show that the clause was valid and reasonable. You also
have to prove the breach. The amount you recover is more likely to be based
on what the former employee can actually afford to pay rather than on what
your losses are.
Despite the legal protections against former employees competing with you
for business or employees, the best protection is to compartmentalize —
don’t let any single employee see too much of your business. We discuss
intellectual property (IP) protection strategies in Chapter 17.
Putting employees on probation
Your employment contracts should all impose a probationary period on new
employees. After an employee is through the probationary period, terminat-
ing him or her — even for poor performance — without ultimately paying
compensation is hard. Later in this chapter, we discuss the best ways to
screen for talent (see “Finding [and Keeping] Good People”). Nevertheless,
you’ll still likely find that you’ve hired people who aren’t up to their jobs. The
probationary period is crucial for trying to ferret out your hiring mistakes.
During the probationary period, you can terminate employees if you discover
that they misrepresented themselves during the hiring process. You can also
let go of employees during this time if you decide that they aren’t suitable for
the position. Basically, you get a good deal of subjective leeway during the
probationary period.
Currently, local laws govern the maximum length of probationary periods.
How long you can keep an employee on probation usually depends on the
term of the contract. The shorter the contract, the shorter the maximum 
probation period is. In general, you’re able to have at least one month for a
probationary period. Under the current national labor law, the probationary
period can’t be more than six months.
Terminating employees
After the probationary period (see the preceding section), an employer can
terminate an employee for a “serious” conduct violation, gross negligence, or
causing the employer to suffer severe losses. Also, if the employer gives at
least 30 days notice, it can terminate an employee who’s unable to do his or
160
Part II: Starting Up in China 

her job due to non-job-related sickness or injury or where the employee falls
short of job standards despite receiving training or having other jobs.
Even though the employer appears to have leeway to terminate an employee
who doesn’t do a good job, as a practical matter, it’s hard to do so without
paying compensation. Most labor disputes must go to mediation and arbitra-
tion, and employees do pretty well in arbitration; therefore, expect that if you
terminate an employee without reaching a settlement first, you may end up
owing in arbitration.
You’re not allowed to terminate employees without paying compensation
merely because you want to reduce headcount. If you want to get rid of a few
employees who still have time left on their contracts, you have to work it out
with them. If you own a factory or other business and want to reduce head-
count by a large number, consult with the local labor bureau. The bureau will
usually negotiate with you on behalf of the workers.
Legal disputes
By law, a labor dispute must almost always be heard by an arbitration panel
before a court can hear it. The parties can choose to mediate the dispute
before going to arbitration. If mediation isn’t successful or the parties don’t
opt for it, the complaining party has to apply to the local Labor Dispute
Arbitration Committee for arbitration. This committee is made up of the 
following:
 Representatives from the local labor bureau
 The local Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(COFTEC) or Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) (see Chapter 7)
 A trade union
Employees win their arbitration cases outright 47.5 percent of the time;
employers win outright only 12.9 percent of the time. The balance is mixed
judgments. If a party doesn’t agree with an arbitration award, it can appeal it to
the local People’s Court. The court doesn’t have to hear the dispute, though.
Unions
The Chinese Communist Party controls trade unions that are organized along
industrial and geographic lines. Chinese law requires that employers allow
their employees to join a trade union. Historically, trade unions haven’t had
much power and haven’t often engaged in collective bargaining; they served
161
Chapter 9: Building a Local Team in China

social and political functions. Currently, some employers and trade unions
execute collective contracts, but they’re not very detailed. Instead, these
contracts are framework agreements that guide employees’ individual 
contracts. In actuality, people often see Chinese trade unions as quite 
pro-employer.
The trend is changing, though. Trade unions are becoming stronger and more
pro-employee. In 2006, Wal-Mart had a front-page spat with a major trade
union and the government over whether its employees could join a union.
Wal-Mart has a firm no-union policy, but the public and government pressure
on Wal-Mart in China was eventually successful. Wal-Mart allowed its Chinese
employees to join a trade union. This news is likely a sign that trade unions
are going to be a bigger force in employer-employee relations in the future.
The new labor law will likely give trade unions more rights and power. It may
also encourage collective bargaining.
Avoiding a Shocking Corporate Culture
Controlling the workplace culture should be a top priority throughout the
entire planning and hiring process. Regardless of how you run your company
back home, we guarantee it has a much more developed culture of account-
ability and controls than what most Chinese employees are used to. Your
Chinese employees need to both understand the controls and subscribe to
the idea of having them. You need to get people to understand that when the
system works well, the company does well and the employees also benefit.
Also, your China operation is going to need a lot of support from home (see
Chapter 4), and having a common corporate culture helps a lot with that.
Finally, Chinese people who want to work in FIEs are looking for something
different from traditional Chinese company culture. They’ll appreciate your
efforts to indoctrinate them into how you operate back home. The following
sections explain how to export your culture and why it’s so important.
Passing up the Chinese imperial palace
Chinese imperial palaces were infamous for their over-the-top intrigue and
politics. A very real risk of not implementing your company culture in China
is having the FIE go the complete opposite way and become an imperial
palace. Before you laugh, you’d be surprised at how many Western compa-
nies’ China operations have gone that route!
162
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Imperial palace culture in a Western company can work something like this:
You have a top manager who’s more concerned with enjoying the perks of his
position than with running the business effectively. The most common perk he
wants to enjoy is employees who are sycophants — praising everything the
manager says or does and speaking extremely deferentially (or in Western 
parlance, “kissing butt”). These managers see themselves as the emperors of
their fiefdoms.
Many Chinese employees, who’ve been exposed their whole lives to the rigid
hierarchies that result from China’s imperial tradition and government
bureaucracy, immediately know how to act when an emperor is managing the
office. In addition to becoming sycophantic, they rarely offer their opinions
on how to improve the business. And they very rarely offer any opinion that
may run contrary to the emperor’s view.
The organization develops a rigid hierarchy, with each employee sizing up his
or her rank relative to other employees’. Employees focus on secretly under-
mining employees above them. Meanwhile, they also seek to enjoy the perks
of their positions by being overly harsh to their subordinates. Employees in
this environment become especially afraid of being recognized as having
made a mistake. As a result, they often refuse to share information or collabo-
rate with their coworkers. They may even attempt to sabotage each other’s
work. The result is a dysfunctional organization dominated by fear of making
mistakes and distrust of coworkers. This culture will affect your bottom 
line — quickly!
Guarding against imperial 
palace syndrome
To an extent, many Chinese employees feel somewhat comfortable in an
imperial palace type of environment. They don’t usually like working in it, but
it’s familiar to them in many ways. It reflects a lot of traditions, the educa-
tional system, and the types of jobs their parents and grandparents had. If
given enough leeway, some Chinese employees will revert to this kind of
system. However, by training managers and employees, you can encourage a
Western-style work culture.
One of the keys to guarding against imperial palace culture is watchfulness
and control. Observe your employees closely. Do they seem overly deferential
to you or other managers? Do they hesitate to offer opinions? Do you sense
that they’re trying hard to look busy even when they aren’t? Are employees
making subtly derogatory statements to you about their coworkers? The fol-
lowing sections explain what you can do to prevent an imperial palace — or
turn around the one you have.

The best way to export your culture to China is through your top managers.
Ideally, from your home operation, you can send over a general manager
(GM) and a financial controller who understand your company and culture
well. Be clear to both of them that one of their priorities is ensuring that your
culture takes hold in China.
If you can’t find suitable people in your operations, require that anybody you
hire from outside for a senior management position work for at least six
months (the longer the better) in your home operation to get an understand-
ing of how it works. If your top one or two managers aren’t long-time com-
pany employees, you may want to send HR personnel over to China during
the initial period (at least several months) to help train the employees.
Hiring managers who aren’t would-be emperors
If you’re going to hire an outside manager (or management team) to run your
operations, then you have to be especially careful. Some companies assume
that they can guard against imperial palace syndrome just by hiring a
Chinese manager with some Western education and experience. That’s not
necessarily the case. Some returnees (but certainly not all) can become
emperor-managers pretty easily. Sizing up their potential to become emper-
ors is pretty much impossible because they’ll know how to act very Western
when they’re around their Western bosses.
The other issue with returnees is that they often can’t admit to making a mis-
take or being wrong for face reasons. Ordinary Chinese heap many expecta-
tions on returnees, creating tremendous pressure for them to be almost perfect
in their management. This situation doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go the
returnee route. But if you do, have a senior person on the ground in China who
has the clear authority to make sure that your corporate culture is instilled.
Western expatriates who’ve been in Asia for a while can pose the same poten-
tial danger. They may have become so used to this culture (which is also in
other parts of Asia) that they turn your company into an imperial palace. On
the other hand, Chinese who don’t have overseas experience can make excel-
lent foreign-invested enterprise (FIE) managers — and for much less money!
It all depends on the individual. Note that a Chinese manager who doesn’t
already have significant experience working in FIEs is unlikely to work well as
your manager.
Beware any manager who resists your control of the culture by telling you
that things are “done differently in China.” You have to respect cultural differ-
ences, but there’s no reason why the big picture can’t resemble a Western
company. Don’t ever fall for the you-don’t-understand-China rationale from
such a manager, either. You don’t understand everything, but good business
practices are good business practices.
164
Part II: Starting Up in China 

When you see this kind of imperial environment in an FIE, it usually comes
from the people in charge. Usually, your top management negotiates greater
job protections in their contracts than the law requires. You have two main
choices when making a change:
 Take the manager completely by surprise, kick him or her out of the
office one day, and more or less offer compensation per the contract.
 Work with the manager to get him or her to exit gracefully, often giving
more than what the contract requires.
You don’t want to decide to fire the manager but then inadvertently tip him
or her off before you take action. If the manager sees the termination coming,
he or she can do a lot of damage before removal. For that reason, the second
approach is usually better.
Cultivating an ideal culture
Although all workers contribute to corporate culture, managers especially
can help set the stage for the values and norms of your company. First,
clearly tell managers that you expect them to instill a Western company 
culture. Provide managers with detailed dos and don’ts. For example, 
managers should
 Enthusiastically maintain various controls (good controls are vital in
China — we discuss them in Chapter 17)
 Make extra efforts to recognize lower-level employees, such as 
secretarial staff
 Neither discuss employees with one another nor convey messages to
employees through other employees
For information on maintaining an appropriate employee-management 
relationship, see “Earning respect,” later in this chapter.
Frequently train your employees how to behave in an open, Western-style
culture. Here’s how:
 Offer employees who display great teamwork small prizes or bonuses,
which should mitigate Chinese employees’ tendency to view coworkers
as competitors.
 Ensure that employees speak their heartfelt opinions in meetings by
making each one speak out in turn and asking numerous follow-up 
questions until you feel that they’ve said their piece. Hopefully, they’ll
realize that they should express their opinions freely.
 Publicly praise employees for saying things that are out of consensus 
or contrary to your views. This move reinforces that your FIE is not a
traditional Confucian enterprise.
165
Chapter 9: Building a Local Team in China

 Assign people to work in teams, and be clear that they’re collectively
responsible for the success and failure of their tasks.
 Accept no finger-pointing when you have problems within the teams.
 Minimize the formal titles you give to employees. That way, they’ll spend
less time obsessing over their relative ranks.
 Give each person a turn to lead a team: If you form a team of four employ-
ees, let employee A lead one task. Then employee B takes a turn, and so
on. After the completion of each leadership turn, the leaders fill out formal
evaluations on the other team members; the other team members also
each formally evaluate the leader. Such a system that minimizes rank and
causes abusive team leaders to reap what they sow can reduce the hierar-
chy of your office.
Keeping an eye on managers and employees
The only way to prevent your company from becoming an imperial palace is
to constantly and closely watch your managers and the company. Keep an
eye on your employees through a combination of obvious and not-so-obvious
monitoring. By obvious monitoring, we mean spending some time in the
office observing. Sit in on meetings to see whether employees seem to be
offering their opinions. Figure out whether they’re behaving in a strict hierar-
chical way toward one another. Try to cultivate relationships with many of
them. To conduct your not-so-obvious monitoring, speak with many of these
same employees from time to time. Be careful when you do check in with
them, though — if you want them to speak frankly, keep the fact of your meet-
ing confidential and secret.
If your China people seem to be scheduling a lot of out-of-the-office time for
your observers, you may want to ask some questions.
Finding (and Keeping) Good People
China has far more workers than jobs. However, in the segment of office
workers qualified to work in foreign-invested enterprises, the market is
extremely tight. You’ll have a much easier time hiring factory workers, 
which we discuss in Chapter 13.
In this section, we alert you to common problems you encounter among
Chinese job seekers, show you how to find and screen applicants, provide
strategies for making an offer, and finally give you some tips for keeping as
many good people as you can in China’s competitive job market.
166
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Employer beware: Avoiding common 
problems among job seekers
China is still in the middle of a tremendous transition from a centrally-planned,
SOE-based communist economy to a more market-based one. Not everybody
has adjusted to this change yet. That said, fantastic people are in the market in
China — finding them may just take some perseverance and strategy.
Here are the three most common problems among job seekers in China:
 Lack of motivation: Some candidates aren’t very motivated. Because of
the one-child policy, many only children have been doted on by their
families since birth, and most qualified job seekers have known only a
booming economy. The fact that a lot of young people still live with their
parents makes the problem worse. Because their basic living expenses
are covered, they don’t really need the job.
 Serial job hopping: Because China’s job markets have been white hot
for people with bankable skills, you see that people change jobs more
frequently than in the West. Some people may change often because
they’re looking for more professional development. That’s a fair reason,
and that’s something you have to address if you want to retain employ-
ees (we discuss how later in “Retaining talent”). However, some employ-
ees are pure mercenaries, taking advantage of the hot market conditions
to up their salary numerous times per year. From some perspectives,
that’s also a fair reason. However, retaining these people can be harder
because someone’s always willing to outspend you for a qualified
employee.
 Lack of skills: Employees whose backgrounds suggest they have certain
skills (in terms of education or experience) may not have them in reality.
We soon discuss the issues with some degrees and certificates you may
come across.
We address ways to screen for these problems in the following sections.
Although recruiting employees in China is more challenging than in the West,
you may find that your best Chinese employees are more loyal, dedicated,
and capable than anybody you’ve hired elsewhere.
Finding applicants
If you’re looking to fill a higher-end position, you can always use a recruiting
firm. China’s major cities have a great deal of recruiters, whom you can find
on the Internet and at networking events (see in Chapter 15). Another option
is searching and posting on the big job Web sites in China. The most popular
ones are 51job (www.51job.com) and Zhaopin (www.zhaopin.com). Also,
167
Chapter 9: Building a Local Team in China

some foreign chambers of commerce have Web sites that allow member
employers to post openings.
If you’re in a city with a large expatriate population, you can advertise in the
magazines that cater to expatriates. Many Chinese who are interested in
working in foreign-invested enterprises read these magazines out of interest
and to improve their English.
When you have some good employees, the best way to find potential hires
may be to ask them to recommend friends. Otherwise, use whatever network
you have in China to see whether you can track down some good employees.
If your company is set up as a representative office (see Chapter 7), you have to
officially hire PRC employees through a labor dispatch agency, such as Foreign
Enterprise Human Resources Service Company (FESCO) or China International
Intellectech Corporation (CIIC). In most cases, representative office employers
find and screen their own candidates through the methods we discuss. But
instead of signing contracts with the employees, representative offices sign
labor service agreements with the dispatch agencies. The employees likewise
sign their actual contracts with the dispatch agency, but the representative
offices decide on the terms of those contracts. Probation and termination issues
are the same for employees hired through dispatch agencies. The dispatch
agencies collect a monthly service fee for each employee they hire.
Screening applicants
You can minimize the odds that you’ll hire a problematic employee. The fol-
lowing sections provide some interviewing tips to follow as you screen your
applicants.
Many of the people you interview aren’t as polished as what you’d see in the
United States, but don’t necessarily count that against them. Remember that
many candidates haven’t been taught how to properly interview — or even how
to dress for interviews. Also, if you’re interviewing candidates in English, many
may be nervous about the added pressure of speaking a foreign language.
While you’re screening employees, don’t forget that they should be screening
you, too. Sell good candidates on your company throughout the interview
and hiring process.
And so we meet again: Holding multiple interviews
Repeatedly interviewing an interesting candidate is a good idea. A number 
of job seekers have memorized textbook answers to common interview 
questions (such as questions about their backgrounds). Asking the same
questions a second and third time on different occasions can be useful
because inconsistencies can signal that an answer is manufactured. Multiple
168
Part II: Starting Up in China 

interviews can also help you figure out where a candidate’s nervousness
ends and language skills begin.
Asking questions
In general, you should ask candidates a lot of why questions. Focus on why
they studied what they did and why they joined and left previous jobs. Also
ask them a lot of questions about what they liked and didn’t like about
school, previous jobs, and other activities you see on their resumes. You
want to hear answers that indicate the candidates have career plans. When
you hear answers that sound like a candidate just views a job as a paycheck
and/or was never really interested in the field, you probably want to avoid
that candidate. Many employers in the West commonly ask why questions,
but your China interviewing should emphasize it.
After you get a sense of a candidate’s career plan, ask how he or she thinks
working for your company fits with the plan. By looking for thoughtful candi-
dates, you should be able to reduce the number of unmotivated or serial-
job-switcher hires.
To get a sense of how a candidate may work in a team environment, ask
about a group project he or she was involved with that didn’t go well. Ask
why it didn’t go well, with a good deal of follow-up questions. A candidate
who blames coworkers a lot instead of accepting individual responsibility
may be a bad team member.
For employees who are going to be performing more-advanced functions, you
may want to test critical thinking skills. One way is to present your candi-
dates with case studies. Keep language barriers in mind and make sure the
case-study facts are simple.
Determining the applicant’s skills
You can determine whether a candidate has the necessary skills in a couple of
ways. First, he or she should definitely know terminology. Ask a number of
169
Chapter 9: Building a Local Team in China
So, where are you from? Considering hukou
Some employers consider hukou (domicile —
see “Employment contracts,” earlier in this
chapter) as a factor when evaluating candi-
dates. Some employers believe that people with
hukou from other parts of China are more likely
to be motivated because they’re usually not
living with their parents; also, their quasi-
immigrant status may mean that they’re more
determined because they were bold enough to
uproot themselves and pursue a better life. On
the other hand, some employers think local
hukou is an advantage because outside hukou
employees may eventually want to be spon-
sored for local hukou, which costs time and
money. Many employers don’t consider hukou
at all in hiring decisions.

questions that use common terminology related to the skill set you’re looking
for. (If you don’t know any of the applicable terminology yourself, hunt around
online before the interview to find it.)
Also, you should rigorously test skills, especially technical skills, before you
hire a candidate. The method obviously depends on the skills you’re looking
for. Don’t shy away from written tests, either.
Weighing degrees and education
Degrees and certificates aren’t always what they seem. Many universities,
certification programs, and graduate schools in China are very profit-
oriented. As a result, some of them give degrees to anybody who can breathe
(and pay tuition). Also, some foreign degrees are similarly meaningless. The
United Kingdom in particular has a number of diploma mills that give degrees
(especially graduate) to anybody who has the money to pay. The United
States and other countries have such disreputable institutions as well. If you
do some homework on a Western school and find out that an extremely large
portion of its student body is from China or Asia, that’s a bad sign.
Before you decide that you want to hire only from China’s top universities,
though, remember that university admission is primarily based on just one
examination. You can find plenty of extremely bright people who, for one
reason or another, tested poorly on that day. As a result, they had to attend
less prestigious schools. In China, you may come across such diamonds in
the rough. Be open to candidates who aren’t from top schools — particularly
if they submit a well-written cover letter or resume. Such a diamond in the
rough is also unlikely to have switched jobs a lot.
You can find good candidates among retired (55+) workers. Many of them,
particularly engineers, have great skills.
Figuring out the applicant’s level of initiative
The difference between a good employee and a great employee in China is
often initiative. For a number of cultural and education reasons, initiative 
is in somewhat short supply in the workforce. You can try to figure out
whether a candidate has some initiative by asking questions about a work-
place problem he or she faced and how the candidate tackled it. You should
also find out why the candidate chose that solution — the information doesn’t
help much if it was somebody else’s idea. However, don’t be surprised if you
don’t get many good answers to this line of questioning.
Another indicator of whether you have a great candidate on your hands is
the quality of the questions he or she asks you during the interview. You’ll
probably have to work hard to make candidates feel like they can ask you
questions, though. Make sure that the tone of the interview is conversational
and repeatedly encourage candidates to ask questions. Getting them to query
you can be like pulling teeth, but if a candidate asks some good questions,
that’s a great sign.
170
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Making an offer
There’s unfortunately no great way to know how much to offer somebody.
China’s labor market lacks good data, and salaries are inflating rapidly among
FIE workers. As a result, many positions involve a big salary range.
The conventional way of finding out what you should pay is to buy data or
studies from a consulting firm. Of course, this method’s expensive. A more
practical approach is to develop a network of people who hire similar
employees. Hopefully, your network can give you a decent idea of what a 
certain position should earn.
The convention in China is to pay a guaranteed bonus of at least one month’s
salary right around the Chinese New Year (which is usually in January or
February). Keep this bonus in mind when deciding on salaries. Some compa-
nies use bonuses as a retention strategy — they pay lower monthly salaries,
with higher guaranteed annual bonuses.
A candidate you like is probably interested in more than money, so if you
haven’t done so already, explain how you’re going to help the candidate
develop professionally when you make the job offer. Explain the training the
candidate will receive, skills he or she will develop, responsibilities you’ll
assign, and the path ahead. Worthy candidates need to know these things
before deciding to join your company.
Retaining talent
Right now, retaining good employees in China is very hard. For job seekers
with in-demand skills, most cities offer an unbelievable job market.
Employees usually decide within the first six months of starting a new job
whether they’re in it for the long term, so make sure employees integrate
easily into their new jobs. Get small items correct right off the bat. For exam-
ple, have new employees’ workspaces properly prepared, and ensure that
they’re meeting their coworkers and are made to feel welcome.
Decent Chinese employees are often amazingly motivated to learn from you
and your company; after all, the opportunity to pick up new skills and per-
spectives is one of the main reasons the Chinese join foreign-invested enter-
prises. If you want to keep your talent, you need to fulfill your end of the
bargain by providing them with opportunities to grow.
The other trick to retaining your talent is to nurture them. There’s a differ-
ence between coddling employees (which won’t help you retain them) and
providing a supportive environment. Stay attuned to any issues that develop.
Staying aware is a little harder because of the language and cultural barriers
171
Chapter 9: Building a Local Team in China

but isn’t impossible. In fact, you can task some of your Chinese employees
with helping you out on this front.
At the first sign of a possible problem, sit down with the employee to figure
out what’s bothering him or her. This preventive maintenance can hopefully
save your company from costly turnover. The real challenge is figuring out
which squeaks are important and which you can ignore.
Managing Your Employees
Managing employees anywhere is challenging. In China, it’s even more so
because the Chinese workforce is experiencing growing pains as it adjusts to
a more market-based economy. To properly manage employees in China, you
generally have to be more hands-on than in the West. For this reason,
telecommuting isn’t usually an option in China for employees (nor for their
bosses, unfortunately).
Setting your expectations for basic training
The first challenge with managing employees in China has more to do with
yourself: You need to have reasonable expectations. In many cases, compar-
ing Chinese workers to U.S. or European ones is unfair because of the differ-
ences in background and education. On the other hand, managers who’ve
worked throughout Asia say that Chinese employees often compare quite
favorably to those in some parts of Asia.
Don’t expect your employees to know all the basics that Westerners take for
granted, such as proper phone etiquette, how to behave in front of customers,
and appropriate workplace attire. Most of them are able to pick up the basics
easily if you train them. Think about all the functions a new hire will perform —
large and small — and be ready to instruct. You may have to offer training for
even the most mundane tasks, such as taking phone messages.
Helping employees manage their work
One of the areas Chinese employees commonly need help in is organizational
skills. If you’re assigning multiple tasks to your employees, you need to stay
on top of them to make sure they’re handling their tasks. Don’t expect them
to come to you for help if they’re feeling overwhelmed — they may be afraid
of losing face.
172
Part II: Starting Up in China 

General questions such as “Is everything under control?” may not get you
good answers. You probably need to ask about the status of each task the
employee is supposed to handle. Ask each employee for such updates until
he or she shows the ability to multitask effectively.
Earning respect
Although you don’t want to be an emperor (see the earlier section “Passing
up the Chinese imperial palace”), you do have to be more autocratic in many
ways than you’d be in the West.
When employees lose respect for the boss, they lose their motivation to per-
form assigned tasks. They don’t want to do this, and you don’t want them to,
either. Regaining lost respect is difficult — in the end, you may have to get rid
of the employee! Ignore this section at your own risk.
Many (but not all) of your Chinese employees need you to be a strong leader
in order to earn their respect. Put another way, you should be clear that
there’s a separation between you as the boss and them as the employees. You
should of course be friendly with your employees and treat them well; how-
ever, you shouldn’t cross the boundary into being friends with most of them.
Creating a clear separation between you and your employees would chafe on
many Western management experts. However, China is a very Confucian soci-
ety. Confucian values stress subservience and respect to leaders and elders.
In the minds of some employees, if you don’t act like you’re the boss, then
you’re an employee just like they are.
Creating that separation without going crazy and becoming an emperor is
fairly easy:
 Always be conscious of maintaining your face in front of your employees
(see Chapter 11 for details on face).
 Take a personal interest where appropriate in their lives, but don’t share
too much of your personal self with them.
 Don’t ever reveal too much of what you’re thinking.
 Don’t be overly apologetic (or apologetic at all) for giving them an
assignment that’s unpleasant.
 Speak sternly when the need arises (do so privately in most cases).
 Have employees come to your office most of the time instead of going to
their desks or offices to speak.
173
Chapter 9: Building a Local Team in China

Creating the boss aura doesn’t mean discouraging employees from publicly
stating opinions that differ from yours. Always encourage them to speak out,
even if they disagree with you. Insist that they do so respectfully, though.
And when you’ve ended a debate, make sure it’s over.
Maintain your aura around all new employees until you feel that a particular
employee doesn’t need it. The employees who don’t need that aura may
come to resent some of what you do to create the aura, just as a Western
employee would. In general, more educated and experienced employees are
the ones who fit into this category.
Using the boss aura on your expatriate employees isn’t a good idea. They’ll
definitely resent it. If that means that you openly treat your expatriate and
Chinese employees differently, Chinese employees will usually accept that
(unless the difference is enormous).
Managing office politics
Your company can become pretty political when you have Chinese employ-
ees. Watch out for employees who are looking to unnecessarily involve them-
selves in coworkers’ assignments or trying to assert authority over each
other. For example, your office administrator may start insisting to other
employees that they get his or her approval before doing something. Don’t be
surprised to see this happen even though you never spoke about the idea
with a single employee! This maneuvering is part of the great bureaucratic
tradition of China — people and organizations constantly jostle each other to
increase their areas of responsibility and thus their power. Again, you have to
be very hands-on and vigilant as a manager.
To preempt political behavior, provide training that stresses teamwork and
cooperation. The training should stress Western management models and
methods. See “Cultivating an ideal culture” for details.

Getting Your Mind on Money
In This Chapter

 Maximizing how much money you can take out of China
 Finding funding
 Understanding company and individual taxes
T
his chapter is complicated, but it’s essential reading for doing business in
China. We start with basics about China’s currency, the renminbi (RMB).
Then we quickly get into how the RMB affects your day-to-day business. This
chapter also covers how to get financing for your business. Finally, we dis-
cuss China’s corporate and individual tax systems and how to get your
money out of China.
Introducing China’s Currency: 
The Tricky RMB
China’s currency has two names: the renminbi (RMB) (run-mean-bee) and the
yuan (yu-en). Renminbi literally means the people’s currency. As this section
explains, the RMB is quite unlike most other currencies you’re familiar with.
It’s considered a soft currency, which means that it isn’t traded on world
exchanges. China places a lot of controls on trading the RMB, and they affect
almost every aspect of your business. (For information on cash, including its
denominations and appearance, see Chapter 5.)

What you need to know about the RMB
One of the crucial aspects to doing business in China is understanding
China’s system for converting money. The RMB is only a semi-convertible 
currency — that is, you can convert the RMB to U.S. dollars, euros, or other
foreign currencies only under certain circumstances.
In the system you’re probably used to, a person in the U.S. who wants to get
euros goes to the bank, which then takes the customer’s dollars and gives
him or her euros. The next step is the key: The bank sends the dollars to
Europe, where it can exchange them to replace the euros it gave the cus-
tomer. If the bank couldn’t send out the dollars, it wouldn’t be able to
exchange the money for the customer. The customer has money, the bank
has money, everything’s done. These days, bank exchanges are electronic,
but the principle is the same.
In China, you find a number of restrictions on sending RMB out of the country.
Under these restrictions, banks (as well as other businesses and individuals)
can’t send RMB overseas for many types of transactions. You even see some
limitations on receiving foreign currency from overseas in China. All these
restrictions make having a worldwide market for RMB impossible. Therefore,
the world market doesn’t set the RMB exchange rates. The People’s Bank of
China (PBOC), which is China’s government-run central bank, is in charge of
managing the RMB. The PBOC sets the RMB’s exchange rates, or peg. (You can
find the current exchange rates into RMB [Chinese yuan] at finance.yahoo.
com/currency.) Because the RMB isn’t traded in world markets, exchanging
RMB outside of China, except in Hong Kong, is hard.
China limits the flow of the RMB because it wants money flowing into the
country to fund investments. Allowing money to freely flow out may reduce
the amount of money available to fund investment in China. Also, the govern-
ment still likes to maintain some control over the economy, and setting the
exchange rate is a powerful way to do so. If China increases (appreciates) the
value of the RMB against other currencies, then its exports become more
176
Part II: Starting Up in China 
The Hong Kong dollar
Hong Kong’s currency is the Hong Kong dollar
(HKD). Even though China has assumed sover-
eignty over Hong Kong, Hong Kong maintains
separate control over its currency. In contrast
to the RMB, the HKD is a hard currency, which
means that it can be exchanged anywhere in
the world. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) manages the currency. For many years,
the HKMA has kept the HKD pegged to the U.S.
dollar. In other words, the HKMA ensures that
the HKD maintains a steady value against the
USD, which is about 7.7 to 7.8 HKD to 1 USD.

expensive to foreign buyers but imports become cheaper in China. If China
decreases (depreciates) the value of the RMB, then its exports become
cheaper overseas but imports to China become more expensive.
What RMB exchange controls 
mean for your business
In a nutshell, the exchange controls relating to RMB mean more red tape for
you. Your company is going to have to open multiple bank accounts to deal
with different types of foreign currency transactions (which we talk about in
“Opening All the Necessary Accounts”). The controls may affect how you
finance your company (see “Financing Your Business”). And the exchange
controls also make getting money out of China more complicated for foreign
shareholders and lenders (see the later section “Getting Your Money Out of
China). But as we discuss, you do have ways to structure your company to
make these tasks easier.
Choosing a Bank for Your Business
When choosing a bank for your business (and possibly personal) accounts,
you can choose between a foreign bank and a Chinese bank. In a major city,
you can usually find branches of foreign banks. Forgetting any other factors,
177
Chapter 10: Getting Your Mind on Money
Getting a fix on the politics of exchange rates
China’s currency is a hot-button issue in inter-
national politics. The U.S. and some other gov-
ernments accuse the Chinese of keeping the
RMB value too low. According to these critics,
China makes its exports cheaper than they
should be, which costs manufacturing jobs
elsewhere. In 2005, China moved the peg for
the first time in years, appreciating the RMB
slightly. Since then, it has gradually moved the
peg more.
Adding to the political pressure on China’s RMB
policies, many mainstream economists argue
that China should let the market set the
exchange rate. According to this view, markets
are always better at coming up with exchange
rates than governments are. On the other hand,
markets can sometimes mean drastic and
destructive currency fluctuations. The 1997 East
Asian financial crisis is an example. During the
crisis, the economies of many Asian countries
that had freely convertible currencies ground to
a halt overnight when their currencies dropped
suddenly and sharply. China, with its currency
restrictions, was relatively unscathed.

such as financing, foreign banks are generally considered to offer better serv-
ice than Chinese banks do, though the costs are higher. Foreign banks also
have fewer branches, so they may not be very convenient. And there are limi-
tations (that vary by bank) on how much RMB business they can do. Depending
on your needs and preferences, you may end up banking with both a foreign
bank and a Chinese bank.
A number of Chinese banks offer good service — some say even better than
the service at foreign banks. They’re usually the small- to medium-size Chinese
banks, such as China Merchants Bank (CMB). Major Chinese banks, such as
the Bank of China (BOC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank (ICBC), are
rapidly improving their service, and they have the best branch networks.
One test of your bank’s service is whether it’ll take care of all verification and
processing related to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)
without charging you fees. (See the upcoming section titled “Switching things
up: Accounts for foreign exchange” for info on SAFE.)
If you’re going to borrow money for your business from onshore sources (see
the upcoming section titled “Borrowing from onshore”), you’ll probably end
up borrowing from the bank where your business accounts are. Therefore, if
you think you’ll apply for loans, focus on banks’ lending departments when
figuring out where to open your accounts.
Opening All the Necessary Accounts
After choosing a bank, you’re ready to set up your accounts. Most foreign-
invested enterprises (FIEs) open from three to five accounts — one RMB
account and two to four for dealing with transactions that involve exchanging
foreign currency. Read on.
Working with the people’s currency: 
Your RMB account
The RMB account is for paying RMB-denominated expenses. These expenses
usually include your PRC employees’ salaries, overhead, and payments to
domestic suppliers. You also deposit your RMB revenue into this account.
Most smaller businesses don’t need more than one RMB account.
178
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Switching things up: Accounts 
for foreign exchange
In addition to an RMB account for RMB transactions, you need to open sev-
eral accounts in order to navigate the RMB exchange controls (which we dis-
cuss in the earlier section “Introducing China’s Currency: The Tricky RMB”).
You need separate foreign exchange (forex) accounts for all remittances, or
foreign currency payments sending money into or out of China.
The body that enforces China’s forex laws and regulations is the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). Regulating these types of forex
accounts and remittances is one of its primary jobs. You first need SAFE
approval to open each forex account — your bank should be able to walk you
through the SAFE approval process.
When SAFE approves opening a forex account, it specifies the scope of the
account (the types of transactions that the account may be used for). SAFE
also specifies the maximum amount of foreign currency allowed to be held in
the account, based on the company’s registered capital (see Chapter 7) and
foreign currency needs. Any amount of foreign currency in the account above
the maximum needs to be exchanged for RMB and moved to the RMB account.
China divides forex transactions into two general types: current account and
capital account. You almost certainly need at least one account for each type
of transaction, although some companies open additional capital-item bank
accounts to deal with loans. We discuss current and capital accounts in the
following sections.
Current-item bank accounts
Current account items involve the day-to-day forex transactions that a com-
pany may undertake. Examples of typical current items include trade pay-
ments for imported goods and services, intellectual property (such as
trademarks and patents), licensing fees, expatriate salaries, payments of 
dividends and after-tax profits, and foreign travel expenses.
As the name implies, your company may use its current-item bank account
only for current account items. This is the account from which you pay your
current account expenditures, and it’s also the account into which you
receive foreign currency payments for your overseas sales.
SAFE has been giving banks more authority to supervise forex transactions on
their own. In almost all cases, you don’t need SAFE approval for current account
transactions. In order to pay a current account item (either with foreign cur-
rency already in your account or by converting RMB into foreign currency), you
need to show the bank some basic documentation about what you’re paying for.
179
Chapter 10: Getting Your Mind on Money

For example, to pay for imported goods, your company may have to present the
import contract, invoice, and some other documents. Submitting these docu-
ments isn’t part of an approval process — it’s usually just a formality.
Capital-item bank accounts
Capital account items are less frequent than current account items and are
usually investment-related. They include registered capital contributions (see
Chapter 7), loan repayments, asset sale proceeds, and funds for overseas
investments.
You need at least a general capital item account; however, many businesses
set up three types of these accounts:
 General capital: The general capital account is the account you deposit
your foreign currency capital contributions into. Note that if your cur-
rent account has no foreign currency but your capital account does, you
can often use the money in your capital account to pay current items.
 Loan proceeds: If you’re going to borrow money from overseas (which
we discuss later in this chapter in “Borrowing from offshore”), you must
set up another special capital item bank account just to receive and hold
the loan proceeds.
 Loan repayment: In order to repay an overseas loan, you have to open
yet another special capital item bank account specifically for your loan
repayments!
We include this info on the Cheat Sheet as well. Keep it handy when you do
your banking to make sure you put funds in the right accounts.
You must pay all registered capital contributions into the proper capital account
at the bank. Any money otherwise sent into China doesn’t count as contributed
capital. Moreover, if you or the parent company is going to pay any expenses for
the FIE, make sure you pay them through the FIE’s capital account — otherwise,
these expenses also won’t count toward the capital contribution.
To exchange RMB to pay for capital account items, you need approval from
SAFE. Your bank should be able to tell you what documents you need to pro-
vide in order to get approval.
Getting Your Money Out of China
In this section, we tell you how to get your profits out of China, as well as
how to recoup portions of your investment — short of liquidation, of course.
(For information on whether you need approval to convert your RMB, see the
earlier section called “Switching things up: Accounts for foreign exchange.”)
180
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Sending profits back home
Don’t worry — you can get your profits out of China! Your company is allowed
to send dividends (profits) to all foreign shareholders on the current account
(see the earlier “Current-item bank accounts” section). First, though, your
company’s registered capital (see Chapter 7) must be completely paid in;
second, you can remit dividends only after the company has paid all applica-
ble taxes on the profits.
To send out the dividends, you have to give the following documents to 
the bank:
 Your company’s tax payment certificate and tax return; if your company
receives any preferential tax treatment (which we discuss later in “Cor-
porate taxes”), you have to also provide supporting documents from
your local tax bureau
 An auditor’s report for the current year
 A resolution from the company’s board of directors authorizing the 
dividends
 The Foreign Exchange Registration Certificate (FERC), which your com-
pany receives from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)
when you get approval for your general capital account
 The capital verification report (see Chapter 7)
SAFE may also require other documents on a case-by-case basis. In most
instances, the process for remitting dividends is a formality rather than an
actual review and approval. However, particularly large remittances (over
US$100,000) and other questionable transactions may receive SAFE scrutiny
even after the bank approves them.
When your FIE expires or is terminated early, you may remit all money
remaining in the company overseas as well.
Unfortunately, you do encounter some limitations in paying dividends:
 Your registered capital must be paid in full.
 You can pay dividends only after the business has been audited for the
year and paid all its taxes (see “Paying the Government without Taxing
Your Patience,” later on). In other words, even if you’ve contributed all
the registered capital, you have to wait about a year in between divi-
dends. Your dividends won’t be tax-deductible business expenses.
 You’re not allowed to dividend out more than the company’s net income
in any given year.
181
Chapter 10: Getting Your Mind on Money

Repaying foreign debt
Foreign debt is any debt that a company registered in China is required to
repay in foreign currency. Among other items, foreign debt includes loans
from a company’s own shareholders (if they must be repaid in foreign cur-
rency) and trade credit.
Being able to repay foreign debt is a two-step process:
1. Register the foreign debt with the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange (SAFE).
If you don’t register the debt with SAFE, your company may not be able to
get approval to exchange RMB to pay it. After you register your company’s
foreign debt, you receive a Foreign Debt Registration Certificate (FDRC).
2. Apply to SAFE for verification when you want to make a foreign debt
payment.
To apply for verification, your company submits the FDRC, the loan
agreement, and a notice for payment from the creditor. Provided that
you’ve registered the debt, SAFE verification is usually routine.
In repaying a foreign debt, your company first has to use its existing for-
eign currency; then it has to get SAFE approval to exchange RMB for any
remaining debt amount.
Some banks handle the SAFE payment verification procedures free of charge.
When shopping for banks, discuss whether they’ll handle this process with-
out charging fees.
Prepaying foreign debt (that is, paying before the loan is actually due), pre-
sents some special issues. SAFE will likely allow you to prepay only if the loan
contract specifically states that you can prepay the debt. You need to make
any prepayments using foreign currency you currently hold — SAFE won’t
approve conversion of RMB for prepaying a loan. In other words, if you don’t
have spare foreign currency, you can’t prepay the loan.
Using other money exit strategies
Fortunately, you have additional ways of getting money out of China. The fol-
lowing sections name some options.
Intellectual property agreements with offshore companies
One common way to get money out of China is for the foreign-invested enter-
prise (FIE) to sign intellectual property (IP) licensing agreements with off-
shore companies that are owned by the same shareholders as the FIE.
182
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Trademarks and technology (either patents or know-how) are the types 
of IP that are commonly licensed.
For example, say you set up an FIE in China and you also set up a company off-
shore in a nation that has a fully convertible currency. Setting up a trademark
license is relatively easy — after your trademark is registered offshore, you reg-
ister it in China. Your offshore company then licenses IP to the FIE. The FIE can
then make regular licensing or royalty payments from its current item account.
Of course, these licensing agreements do have limitations. For one, there
must actually be IP. And you need to make sure that no one in China has
already registered your trademark. Also, note that some types of IP license
agreements — such as technology license agreements — must be registered
with governmental authorities so you can remit licensing fees and royalties.
Also, the amounts the FIE remits as fees and royalties must make sense to the
tax authorities and SAFE. See Chapter 17 for more info on trademarks.
Consulting agreements
Another option for getting money out of China is to sign consulting agree-
ments between the FIE and an offshore company (or yourself). The idea is that
your offshore company (or you) is providing valuable consulting and manage-
ment services to the FIE, even if those services involve only your time.
Shareholder loans to FIE
A common technique for getting money out of China is having a parent 
company provide a shareholder loan to the FIE, which we discuss later in
“Borrowing from offshore.” That way, the FIE must make regular foreign cur-
rency loan payments to the lender — its shareholder!
Financing Your Business
This section mostly discusses debt financing. We begin by talking about gen-
eral commercial loans, both from offshore and onshore sources. We then dis-
cuss specialized types of financing, which include two non-debt types:
venture capital and private equity.
Keep in mind when seeking loans that China sets upper limits on the amount of
debt a business can have relative to its registered capital. The maximum ratio
varies by investment size, and it gets higher as the investment gets larger.
Before reading further, you should know some terminology. Collateral for
loans is often called security. When a borrower provides security, it’s called
pledging — for example, a borrower can pledge its production equipment as
security for a loan.
183
Chapter 10: Getting Your Mind on Money

Borrowing from offshore
In theory, your company can borrow either from banks offshore or within
China. Consider a number of factors when deciding where to borrow from.
Here are the advantages of borrowing from offshore banks:
 If your offshore parent has good credit and this is its first time investing
in China, getting financing from offshore will probably be easier. Banks in
China are interested in your asset base (which won’t be big if you’re just
established) and your track record in China.
 Sometimes the interest rates are lower offshore.
 If you expect the RMB to appreciate against your loan currency, and
your foreign-invested enterprise’s (FIE’s) revenue is in RMB, your loan
will become cheaper to repay as the RMB goes up.
The main disadvantage of borrowing from offshore is that all foreign debt must
be registered. China has no similar regulation for domestic debt; therefore, if
you have foreign debt, where your company stands in relation to its maximum
permitted debt-to-capital ratio will be more obvious to the authorities.
The minimum loan size from an offshore bank to an FIE is usually around
US$10 million. However, if your parent company has an existing relationship
with an offshore bank, the parent may borrow the money and then lend it to
your FIE in the form of a shareholder loan. Shareholder loans are an easy way
to get some of your investment back because FIEs repay them in foreign cur-
rency, not RMB. The parent may also contribute any money it borrows in its
own name as registered capital.
Shareholder loans must comply with most lending laws and regulations.
Whenever an FIE submits a loan contract (whether shareholder or third
party) to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) for verification
of a loan payment, SAFE reviews the interest rate to ensure that it’s in line
with market interest rates. That means that you can’t get extra cash out of
your FIE by charging an excessive interest rate!
If you borrow from offshore, you may have to pledge your shares in the FIE as
security. If you pledge your shares, you have to get approval from the original
approval authority for your FIE. After you receive approval, the pledge must
be registered with the local Administration of Industry and Commerce (AIC),
one of the key approval authorities that companies deal with. See Chapter 7
for more info on approvals.
184
Part II: Starting Up in China 

Borrowing from onshore
When looking to borrow onshore, you can borrow from foreign banks as well as
domestic ones. In many cases, you borrow from the bank where the business
accounts are — especially for small loans — but you do have other options.
(You may want to consider your borrowing options when selecting your 
bank — see the earlier section called “Choosing a Bank for Your Business.”)
Your company can borrow from onshore banks in foreign currencies, regard-
less of whether the banks are foreign or Chinese. However, borrowing foreign
currencies from onshore banks is rare because your proceeds are almost
always used to pay for expenses within China.
Considering loans from onshore foreign banks
Although most onshore loans come from Chinese banks, the government is
opening the banking industry to foreign banks. As a result, foreign banks are
becoming bigger players in onshore deposits and lending. If your parent com-
pany has an offshore relationship with a foreign bank, you may get the best loan
terms at one of the foreign bank’s China branches. Citibank is becoming particu-
larly aggressive among foreign banks in lending to small and medium FIEs.
Foreign banks in China tend to be more interested in cash flow than assets.
Getting loans from Chinese banks
Traditionally, when most FIEs have borrowed from onshore, they’ve borrowed
from Chinese banks. Chinese banks usually offer better borrowing terms on
RMB loans because they have a lot more RMB to lend than foreign banks do.
Also, if you borrow from a Chinese bank, the loan agreements when you borrow
from onshore are simpler than what you’d get in most Western countries. Often,
they’re only seven to ten pages long and are missing many of the financial
restrictions that Western loan agreements have (for example, many Western
loan agreements place a limit on how much overall debt a company may have).
Chinese banks have historically made asset-based loans, and the banks are still
leaning quite heavily toward asset-based lending. Asset-based lenders deter-
mine borrowers’ creditworthiness and maximum loan amounts by the values of
physical assets on the balance sheet. That way, if a borrower defaults, the bank
can foreclose on the assets, sell them, and receive the proceeds.
However, Chinese banks are now beginning to take a more cash flow–based
approach. Cash flow lenders make loan decisions according to financial projec-
tions of how much money will be available to make the payments. Making cash
185
Chapter 10: Getting Your Mind on Money

flow–based loans takes more sophistication because it involves analyzing busi-
ness prospects. Therefore, when you apply for a loan in China, your company
ideally has a good balance sheet and realistic prospects for strong cash flow.
Looking at special considerations for new businesses
If you’re just starting your business in China and want to borrow from
onshore banks, all is not lost — you just have to work a little harder to get
the loan. Because many newly-established FIEs don’t yet have significant
assets, you have to make a pitch to the bank based on your business’s pro-
jected cash flows. The feasibility study you include in your FIE application
packet (see Chapter 7) shows the bank that your company will be able to
repay the loan.
If your offshore parent company is financially strong, it can help the FIE get 
a loan by providing a parent guarantee — that is, the parent agrees to be
responsible for the debt in case the FIE defaults.
If your company is just starting up and you plan on purchasing fixed assets
(land, buildings, or machinery), getting mortgages for those assets is proba-
bly easier than getting a general business loan. We discuss mortgages and
other special types of financing in the next section.
If your FIE is a joint venture (JV — see Chapter 7) and it wants to borrow money,
onshore banks often want the shareholders to the JV to each guarantee loans 
in full. For example, if the JV borrows 10 million RMB, the bank may want each
parent company to guarantee the 10 million RMB. The problem is that the law
limits how much Chinese JV partners can guarantee to the amount of registered
capital that they own. In this example, if the Chinese side owns 5 million RMB of
registered capital, by law it can guarantee only 5 million RMB of JV debt.
Checking out special types 
of debt financing
Even if your company is able to get enough funding internally or from general
business loans, you may want to consider the following types of specialized
financing. The financing costs or other terms of these alternatives may be
more attractive.
Mortgages
A mortgage is a loan specifically to purchase a fixed asset, and it’s also
secured by that asset. In other words, if a borrower defaults on the loan, the
bank can seize that particular asset in order to recover the loan. Usually,
186
Part II: Starting Up in China 

banks lend only up to a certain percentage of the purchase price because
they want to make sure they have enough of a financial cushion if they have
to foreclose. Therefore, you have to put up at least some of the money your-
self. How much the bank lends as a percentage of the asset’s value (called
loan to value, or LTV) mostly depends on the type of asset, the bank, and
your company’s strength.
In general, you can get two types of mortgages: mortgages for land or build-
ings and equipment mortgages. You usually get a larger LTV for land-building
mortgages. Again, the LTV depends on several factors, but 70 percent is usu-
ally a reasonable expectation for land-building mortgages. Equipment mort-
gages usually have lower LTVs.
Letters of credit
Two main types of letters of credit (LCs) are available. One is called a standby
letter of credit, and it’s usually connected with a general bank loan. Standby
LCs are issued based on the same lending criteria as general business loans.
The other type of LC is a commercial LC, which is vital to the import/export
business. A commercial LC is a guarantee from a bank for payment of a trade-
related expense. For example, say your company wants to import some raw
materials from a supplier that you haven’t dealt with before. Because the
seller doesn’t know you, it wants payment before it ships the goods; however,
you don’t want to make payment until you know the goods are on the way.
Commercial LCs are easy to come by because they’re usually not very risky
for the bank. Depending on your company’s credit standing with the bank, it
may have to put aside the money for the LC in a separate bank account.
As we discuss in Chapter 12, inspecting a product before you pay for it is a
good idea. When a bank issues an LC, you’re on the hook for the money.
Therefore, you do run the risk of not getting what you bargained for.
Working capital loans
Working capital loans are small loans used for day-to-day expenses, such as
purchasing inventory, paying rent, and paying salaries. Because working capi-
tal loans are small, getting them from your bank usually isn’t hard. Sometimes
you don’t even have to provide security. If your company does have to pro-
vide security, it’s usually the business’s inventory.
To get a working capital loan, you have to show the bank that the amount is a
reasonable size for your business and that your cash flow can support the loan.
One caveat with working capital loans is that they’re often uncommitted.
In other words, the bank can demand repayment at any time.
187
Chapter 10: Getting Your Mind on Money

Getting private equity financing
You may be able to get equity financing, in which your company sells partial
ownership to an investor. Instead of agreeing to receive a fixed amount of
money in return (as with a loan), the investor shares the upside (or down-
side) of the business as a shareholder.
Public equity is raising money by selling stock to the general public, with the
equity sold (stock) able to trade on a stock exchange. However, public equity
isn’t an option for startup companies. This section discusses private equity
(PE), an invitation-only type of financing — in other words, the general public
can’t participate in the financing. In addition, the equity the investors pur-
chase can’t be traded (at least initially) on a stock exchange.
Venture capital
Venture capital (VC) is a type of private equity financing. Companies raising
venture capital are in their very early stages. In many cases, VC investors
invest in a business that’s little more than a business plan. Venture capital is
sometimes called “vulture capital” because VC investors usually require
entrepreneurs to give up large amounts of equity (and sometimes control).
VC investors take a lot of risk by investing in young companies; therefore,
they want a lot of reward if things work out (hence their vulture nickname). If
you’re looking for VC money, you mainly need to be able to show VC investors
two things:
 That your company will be successful (so present a solid business plan)
 How and when they can exit the investment — in other words, how and
when they can make their money
Far and away, VC investors like to plan to exit by having the company go
public — that is, to have its stock listed on a stock exchange. After the com-
pany’s stock is listed, finding buyers for the stock is easy for investors.
On rare occasions, some VC investors invest with the hope of receiving large
annual cash flows. However, pitching this type of strategy to VC investors is
difficult because they usually don’t want to hold onto an investment for more
than a few years. Even if they’re getting cash yields of 20 percent on their
investment starting immediately (which would be an incredible feat for your
company), investors would still need five years just to break even. For most
VCs, that’s an unacceptably long time.
188
Part II: Starting Up in China 

China’s special VC features
China venture capital (VC) investing has a number of special characteristics
not found in most countries. The main source of these differences is the cur-
rency controls (see “Introducing China’s Currency: The Tricky RMB” at the
beginning of this chapter).
You can’t directly take an FIE public in another country for a number of rea-
sons. For one, because a limited liability corporation (LLC) — the standard
form of Chinese corporation — doesn’t have shares, it can’t sell shares of
stock to be traded on an exchange. And listing on China’s domestic stock
exchanges (in Shanghai and Shenzhen) is currently not a workable option for
FIEs for a host of legal and practical reasons.
If you want your FIE to go public, first set up a special offshore company to
hold your investment in the FIE. Setting up your offshore holding company
first, rather than setting up your FIE and then transferring ownership to the
holding company, is by far the better option. If you instead set up the FIE
first, you need to go through the lengthy application process to set it up. You
then need to go through another lengthy approval process to transfer the
ownership to the holding company.
The government doesn’t usually want People’s Republic of China (PRC)
investors to invest at the offshore level for onshore ventures (an act called
round-tripping) because round-tripping defeats currency controls and can be
a way to evade paying tax; therefore, PRC investors — either PRC citizens or
PRC registered companies — need SAFE approval to join you at the offshore
level for an investment in China. If you don’t heed this warning, SAFE may
revoke your company’s foreign exchange privileges. For more, see Chapter 7.
If your Chinese partner brings up the idea of joining you offshore, you may
want to kill the idea then and there. Some Chinese are used to ignoring these
laws, and by the time they find out that they can’t get the approvals (likely to
be the case), you’ll have wasted a lot of time. Also, a company that’s directly
or indirectly (through other companies) controlled by a PRC investor needs
the same approvals.
Because of the numerous China-specific issues with VC — including getting
cash offshore (see the earlier “Getting Your Money Out of China” section) and
issuing stock options to your employees — make sure you work with a law
firm experienced in VC. Most VC work is currently done at foreign law firms,
but some Chinese law firms (especially those with U.S.-trained partners) are
now doing a lot of VC work as well. Your VC investor usually chooses the law
firm. Before pitching to a potential investor, though, try to bone up more on
legal issues with China VC. Large foreign law firms that do a lot of VC work in
China often have useful articles on the topic on their Web sites.
189
Chapter 10: Getting Your Mind on Money

VC is common in China, but you have an uphill battle if you’re going to pitch
to VC investors who aren’t yet familiar with China’s markets — they may be
scared off when they first hear about the numerous complexities. Decide
whether you’re willing to take the risk.
Evaluate your VC investors carefully — and not just in terms of how much
money they’re willing to invest. Look at how much control they want, whether
they can provide useful advice, and whether they have a track record of
bringing China businesses public. The Asian Venture Capital Journal (www.
avcj.com) is a good source of information on China’s VC players, market,
and challenges.
Non-VC private equity
Non-VC private equity (PE) investors invest in more mature companies. Here
are the two types of PE investors:
 Strategic: Strategic investors invest because of some relationship with
their existing business. For example, a European car company may buy
part of a Chinese car manufacturer because the two companies want to
produce cars in China together.
 Financial: Financial buyers buy businesses purely for profit reasons.
Unlike most VC investors, these buyers may be interested in making
their money back through cash flows. Their motivation may also be to
bring the company public: Sometimes financial PE buyers buy public
companies, make them more efficient, and then bring them public again
a few years later.
If you’re thinking of eventually looking for PE investment, the offshore hold-
ing company structure is a good idea as well. You’ll save a PE investor a lot of
headache that way.
Paying the Government without 
Taxing Your Patience
In dealing with China, you have to deal with both corporate and individual
taxes. As we discuss in the upcoming sections, individual taxes for foreigners
and Chinese nationals vary.
Corporate taxes
In March 2007, the government enacted a new corporate income tax 
(CIT) law, which takes effect January 1, 2008. Unfortunately, because the
190
Part II: Starting Up in China 

implementing regulations haven’t yet come out, the new tax regime isn’t
entirely clear.
Here are some of the changes:
 The main thrust of the new law is equalizing income tax treatment of
Chinese companies and FIEs at a national tax rate of 25 percent (the cur-
rent framework often favors FIEs over Chinese companies). Some com-
panies may qualify for lower rates of 20 percent (for certain small
companies) or 15 percent (for certain technology companies).
 The law also alters the tax-incentive structure. Most likely, incentives will
be more narrowly tailored to encourage investment in certain industries,
such as environmental protection, production safety, and clean energy.
 The new law provides for more stringent enforcement of the CIT, particu-
larly focusing on transfer pricing — the prices for various goods and
services that affiliated companies pay one another. (For info on repre-
sentative office taxation, see Chapter 7.)
The rest of this section explains China’s currently effective (as of writing) busi-
ness tax framework, which the new CIT tax law alters. Despite the changes,
reading this section is still useful because it can give you the lay of the tax
land — particularly in regard to non-income related taxes. Also, portions of
the current tax regime will remain in effect.
Speak with a tax professionals as soon as possible if you’re seriously consid-
ering starting a business (or opening a representative office) in the People’s
Republic of China.
FIE income taxes and incentives
The biggest corporate tax in China is the income tax. All companies legally
established in China are subject to a base income tax rate of 33 percent of
pretax income (30 percent to the central government and 3 percent to the
local government). FIE income tax must be paid within 15 days after the end
of each calendar quarter based on estimated annual taxes, and FIEs must
finally settle their taxes for a given year within five months of the end of the
calendar year. We discuss representative office taxation in Chapter 7.
Even if you don’t set up an FIE in China, your company may still be subject to
China tax if you’re doing business there. Depending on the type of business
you’re doing, your China-based customers may be required to withhold your
taxes for you.
Under the current framework, FIEs are able to take advantage of a number of
tax preferences that greatly reduce these rates. As a result, the average FIE
actually pays taxes of only around 10 percent! Income tax incentives are usu-
ally available to an FIE based on several factors, including the following:
191
Chapter 10: Getting Your Mind on Money

 How large the investment in the FIE is
 How much the FIE will export
 How advanced the FIE’s technology is
 How closely the FIE’s business matches China’s economic goals
Take a look at the most common legally authorized tax subsidies:
 Manufacturing FIEs that the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) or the
Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (COFTEC) cer-
tify as “technologically advanced” can have their 50 percent rate reduc-
tion extended another three years, provided that their tax rate is at least
10 percent during this period.
 FIEs located in the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) — Shenzhen, Xiamen,
Zhuhai, Hainan, and Shantou — pay maximum income tax of only 15 per-
cent (after expiration of any tax holidays or reductions).
 Qualifying service FIEs in SEZs may have a tax holiday during their first
profitable year and pay only 50 percent of the tax rate (in other words,
7.5 percent) the following two years.
 Qualifying manufacturing and high technology FIEs in various economic
development zones may have reduced income tax rates of 15 percent or
24 percent, and they may be eligible for full tax holidays of one to two
years and 50 percent holidays for additional two- to three-year periods.
 Local governments can approve complete exemptions from local taxes
for encouraged foreign investments (see Chapter 7 for info on encouraged
status).
 A foreign investor in an FIE who directly reinvests his or her share of the
FIE’s profit in that or another FIE with a term of at least five years can get
a refund of 40 percent of the taxes paid on the amount reinvested. If the
reinvestment goes into starting or expanding an “export-oriented” or
“technologically advanced” company, the tax refund is 100 percent.
Note: It’s technically illegal for local governments to offer tax subsidies
beyond those specifically authorized by law. However, local governments
receive a substantial portion of the central government’s 30 percent tax on
corporate income. They also receive a lot of money from the other corporate
taxes. Therefore, the local government may have the means to offer your
company large financial incentives (although as we mention in Chapter 7,
stay away from land subsidies!).
The following incentives are currently common, but they’ll be narrowed or
will disappear under the implementing regulations of the new law:
192
Part II: Starting Up in China 

 Manufacturing FIEs with terms of at least 10 years have a complete tax
holiday for their profitable year and a 50 percent rate reduction for the
next three years. This incentive is the minimum incentive available to
manufacturing FIEs. Manufacturing FIEs can still qualify for other applic-
able incentives.
 FIEs that export at least 70 percent of their output in any year can have a
50 percent reduction in their tax rate for that year, provided that their
tax rate is at least 10 percent.
Value-added tax for manufacturers
Manufacturing companies pay a value-added tax (VAT) on items they use as
inputs for their production (that is, raw materials or parts). The VAT on most
items is 17 percent. However, companies that export their production receive
refunds of most or all VAT paid on the exported products.
Small businesses (defined as having sales of less than 1.0 million RMB or 1.8
million RMB, depending on the type of business) pay a VAT of 4 percent.
These small businesses are not eligible for VAT refunds on exports, though.
Encouraged FIEs (FIEs that invest in sectors in which the government offers
incentives for foreign investment — see Chapter 7) can import machinery
and equipment free of VAT and customs duties, provided that they don’t sell
these items for at least five years.
Business tax on services
Service businesses pay business tax on their sales related to most services.
The business tax varies between 3 and 20 percent of sales, but most services
are taxed at 5 percent.
Individual taxes
China’s individual income tax (IIT) system is progressive (see Table 10-1 for
IIT rates). IIT must be paid each month. Employers located in China are
responsible for withholding IIT payments from employees’ salaries. As a for-
eigner, how much (if any) of your income is subject to China tax depends on
whether it’s China source income (see the upcoming section called “China
source income for foreigners). As a foreigner, you’re entitled to deduct a
decent amount of your income for various living expenses. Your Chinese
employees’ income earned in China is all taxed at the standard rates, subject
to only some small deductions.

Here’s how to use Table 10-1 to calculate the amount of tax owed each month:
1. Calculate your China-source monthly gross income (see the following
section for details).
2. Subtract all allowable deductions (which we discuss later in “Allowable
deductions for foreigners”) from monthly gross income to get the
monthly taxable income.
3. Find the row that applies to the monthly income and subtract the
lower end of the income range from the monthly income.
For example, for a monthly taxable income of 30,000 (RMB), you go to
the 20,000-to-40,000 row and subtract 20,000 from 30,000, which gives
you 10,000 RMB.
4. Multiply the number you just got by the tier tax rate.
Multiply 10,000 RMB by 25 percent (the tax rate for that row), which
equals 2,500 RMB.
5. Add that number to the cumulative tax owed amount in your row.
Add 2,500 RMB to 3,625 (the cumulative tax owed for that row), which
gives you a total of 6,125 RMB. The monthly tax payment is 6,125 RMB.

China source income for foreigners
In some cases, which income is China source income is clear. If you’re being
paid a salary by a company established in China, it’s almost always China
source income. However, if you’re being paid by a foreign company (such as
the parent), your income may not be entirely (if at all) considered China
source:
 For people in most countries, if you’re in China less than 183 days in a
year while being paid by a foreign company, then none of your income is
China source. If China doesn’t have a tax treaty with your country, the
cutoff is 90 days.
 If you’re in China more than 183 (or 90) days, your income may not be
entirely China source if your job involves non-China duties (such as
Director of Asia). In this case, you need to determine what portion of
your income is from your duties in China. However, the entire amount of
salaries paid to senior managers in China (that is, China CEOs, CFOs,
and so on) is usually considered to be China source.
As a related matter, China launched a compulsory individual tax filing system
in January 2007. Under it, taxpayers must report their income with the local
tax authorities if they meet one of the following criteria:
 Their annual income exceeds 120,000 RMB.
 They receive income from more than two sources located in China.
 They receive income from abroad.
After you figure out how much your China source income is, you can take
your allowable deductions and then apply Table 10-1 to figure out about how
much you owe in taxes.
If you live in China for five consecutive years without having been absent
from China for an extended period in any one calendar year, then your global
income will be subject to China tax. That means all your income from any-
where in the world will be taxed in China. If you’re in China for the long haul,
you may want to plan on taking a long holiday outside of the country some-
time before you begin your sixth year in China. You need to leave for at least
30 consecutive days or a total of 90 days in any calendar year.
Allowable deductions for foreigners
Foreigners are entitled to a standard deduction of 4,000 RMB per month.
Foreigners are also allowed to deduct “reasonable amounts” of the following
expenses from income:
195
Chapter 10: Getting Your Mind on Money

 Housing
 Laundry expenses
 Unprepared food and restaurant meals
 Transportation
 Two trips home per year with family members
 Language training and education for all accompanying family members
The key, of course, is how much is reasonable. It depends on the city and
even on the district within a city. Your company’s tax accounting firm should
know what the local tax authorities’ policy is. The tricky part is that at the
beginning of the year, you have to estimate how much your deductions will
be for the entire year. You then divide those deductions by the number of
months you’ll be paying taxes (12 for a full year, obviously) and subtract the
monthly average deduction from your monthly gross China source income.
Then you have your monthly taxable income.
You need to show official invoices called fa piao (fa pee-ow) for all expenses
incurred in China. For expenses incurred outside of China, you need the
receipts. If you don’t have enough receipts and fa piao at the end of the year,
you have to pay extra tax.
Always ask for fa piao! Many businesses, especially grocery stores and
restaurants, don’t give you fa piao unless you specifically ask for it.
Chinese employees’ IIT
Chinese employees’ IIT basically works the same way as foreigners’. The only
real difference is that Chinese taxpayers aren’t entitled to the deductions that
foreigners are. Chinese employees are usually entitled to deduct only 1,600
RMB each month from their gross incomes. This is a standard deduction, so
they don’t need to show fa piao.

Understanding How China 
Works (and Doesn’t Work)
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the Chinese way to get things done
 Planning for business meetings
 Communicating with the Chinese electronically
C
hina is known as one of the most challenging places to do business on
the planet, so you have to walk before you run in the Chinese market.
And you’ll be doing a lot of figurative walking, because the Chinese like to do
business at a different pace than what you’re probably used to.
Keep an open mind when working with the Chinese. When you think things
can’t possibly work some way, you may be surprised to find out that they actu-
ally do! You can begin to understand better by reading this chapter. We explain
a bit about Chinese business values, how to prepare for a business meeting,
and ways to get your message across when you can’t meet face-to-face.
Getting Things Done the Chinese Way
One thing’s for sure: Things really work differently in China. To be fair, the
Chinese would say the same thing about doing business in the West, so
everyone has to make a few adjustments. Recognizing the differences in how
things work is important to your success in China. Get it right, and you may
find the key to success in the Middle Kingdom.
Honoring face
Face, or mianzi (pronounced mee-en-zuh), is a key cultural concept to under-
stand when doing business in China. Face is very similar to pride, but how
others perceive you matters more. In other words, nice compliments from

your boss in a one-on-one meeting are good, but you don’t get face until your
boss singles you out in front of your coworkers as a model employee. Here
are the three ways you deal with face in China:
 Give face: Giving someone face is easy: Treat him or her like a big shot,
offer compliments in a group setting, or treat him or her to a big fancy
meal at the trendiest new restaurant. Overall, make sure you’re courte-
ous. Giving face is really all about showing respect.
 Save face: Many Chinese say saving face is the most important kind of face;
it has a grand tradition in ancient Chinese history through legends and sto-
ries. Saving face is avoiding a loss of prestige — most often, you save some-
one else’s face rather than your own (hopefully somebody will do the same
for you, too). For instance, perhaps you rescue a friend or contact who
needs help in a business deal that’s going sour. Or when disagreeing, maybe
you qualify what you say as much as possible by frequently using maybe,
possibly, a little, might, and so on to soften any possible embarrassment.
 Lose face: Losing face is a serious offence to the Chinese. You cause some-
body to lose face by embarrassing him or her or through a private insult.
The insult may not even be that damaging as far as you can tell, but a
person’s face is supersensitive to anything that someone maybe, possibly
could perceive as an insult. You may accidentally cause someone to lose
face in many ways. For example, perhaps you don’t send someone of high
enough rank to pick up an important visitor at the airport, get really angry
at someone in front of others, or write or speak too directly to someone.
The most important thing to remember about face is that losing it or causing
someone else to lose it has consequences. If you cause somebody, even by
accident, to lose face, you can expect never to receive his or her cooperation
again. In fact, the consequences can be a lot more extreme than that: Even if
doing a certain action (such as signing a settlement agreement) seems to
make all the sense in the world for a Chinese person, he or she usually won’t
carry it out if it benefits a person who has made him or her lose face. Also,
other Chinese people may think less of you or your company if you cause
someone to lose face. After all, word gets around.
Note: You know you’re making friends in China when your Chinese friends
feel comfortable enough to joke around with you. The Chinese would never
attempt to poke fun at you if they didn’t consider you a true friend. This
would be a grave insult and loss of face.
Focusing on consensus
Decision making in China is largely done by consensus. Thus, the Chinese
work together to make decisions instead of passing along responsibility to
one group or worker. Not only may the need for agreement cause delay, but
you sometimes feel powerless to understand what’s really going on.
200
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

What foreign investors sometimes don’t appreciate is what takes place
behind the scenes. Because the Chinese work to gain consensus, a lot of
healthy debate and internal conflicts are going on among them. Sometimes
the internal debate or discussion may have nothing to do with your firm.
Often, the Chinese themselves simply don’t know how to proceed. This inde-
cision can be the result of conflicts of interest, vague regulations or laws, or
power struggles among certain officials.
While you’re waiting for the Chinese to gain consensus, not knowing where
you stand can be quite frustrating. You shouldn’t expect the Chinese to vol-
untarily give you regular updates on the status of your project or deal. Your
best approach is to stay in regular contact with them from time to time. Just
check in every week or two.
Teamwork is a part of the cultural heritage that makes China what it is. It’s a
rich tradition and belief system, largely influenced by the scholar Confucius.
His teachings are about respect and responsibilities to key relationships,
including those with superiors, family members, and friends.
Working together for mutual benefit
Many Chinese want to participate fully in the opportunities that international
business relationships provide, and your Chinese business partners want a
win-win relationship. Therefore, making sure your working arrangement is
mutually beneficial is up to you. You can find lots of profitable opportunities
in China, so share the pie with your business partners.
201
Chapter 11: Understanding How China Works (and Doesn’t Work)
Consulting Confucius for business advice
Tradition has it that Confucius, a famous Chinese
philosopher and writer, lived about 2,500 years
ago. This legendary scholar has influenced the
Chinese system ever since. Many of Confucius’s
teachings can give you insight into the Chinese
way of thinking and doing. Take a look at some of
his most famous sayings:
 “Do not do to others what you do not want
done to you.”
 “Before you embark on a journey of revenge,
dig two graves.”
 “He who speaks without modesty will find it
difficult to make his words good.”
 “The cautious seldom err.”
Confucianism is not a religion but rather an ethi-
cal and philosophical system. The teachings
have had a particularly strong influence over
China’s politics and morals. You can see evi-
dence of Confucianism in your business dealings
as you witness the importance of reciprocity,
patience, modesty, prudence, and hierarchy.

The Chinese tend to do business with people whom they know and trust, and
as your friend and business partner, they expect to be treated fairly. However,
the Chinese can be somewhat suspicious of foreign businesspeople because
foreigners have had a history of exploiting the Chinese (see Chapter 3). If
your company doesn’t have a lot of experience in cooperating with business
partners, reconsider whether your company is ready to partner in China.
You may think the Chinese are too hands-on about the details of your busi-
ness arrangements, but to them, they’re just making sure that all your ducks
are in a row. Get used to this involvement and remind yourself that working
with the Chinese may benefit your business. After all, they understand the
business landscape there better than you do.
Working with a Chinese company doesn’t necessarily mean having a joint
venture (JV). You can have contractual arrangements with the Chinese for
things such as distribution, technology licensing, and so on. Of course,
making a mutually beneficial deal with the Chinese can be tricky business.
For details on negotiating with the Chinese, see Chapter 6.
As in anywhere in the world, plenty of untrustworthy businesspeople are out
there. Some people may say all the right things about friendship and trust,
but their intentions don’t line up. Be on your guard when dealing with people
you don’t know. (For information on finding out more about whom you’re
dealing with, go to Chapter 17.)
Although partnering or collaborating with the Chinese can deliver mutual
benefit, many foreign companies prefer to control their own destiny. Some
foreign companies go solo so they can understand how to build competitive
202
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 
Corporate giving in China
Corporate philanthropy has a long tradition in
business, and the Chinese like to see that a
company is committed to benefiting the nation.
Therefore, if your company has the resources,
you may want to consider giving back to China.
Whether the giving is focused on health and wel-
fare or humanitarian efforts or education, foreign
companies are helping China in many ways.
Often, companies directly sponsor specific pro-
grams. For example, some companies build
schools in China’s rural areas. Others provide
grant money or scholarships to students. Some
companies even align their business activity to
the effort. For instance, drug companies may
provide healthcare, insurance companies may
provide scholarship programs to actuaries, and
wind-generating manufacturers may donate
advanced products to rural farmers.
And some companies provide direct monetary
support to the growing number of nonprofit
organizations now operating in China. For
instance, many foreign companies have sup-
ported Golden Key Research Center (www.
goldenkey.org.cn), one of the earliest
nonprofit organizations in China. Golden Key,
which has been a UNESCO partner since 1998,
aims to provide education for children with
visual impairment or blindness.

advantage in the market. This may be a good alternative for your firm, but
consider the risks and rewards before going it alone.
Developing patience
Make no mistake — the Chinese take a really, really long view. Before any
business can really start, just getting to know and trust you takes time. After
you’re in, you have to wade through layers of government bureaucracy.
Negotiations with the Chinese seem to take forever when you’re dealing with
the government, and getting approvals eats up even more time (for more on
earning approvals, go to Chapters 7 and 8). The Chinese seem to have taken a
page out of Confucius’s book: “It does not matter how slowly you go so long
as you do not stop.”
The Chinese often discuss and consider issues internally for a while before
making a decision. (However, their planning and decision-making processes
are often far less sophisticated than what you’re used to — for instance, they
lack detailed financial models and market data collection.) Where you’d likely
make a business decision, the Chinese prefer to mull it over a few days and
consult a few insiders before committing. The benefit to them is that they
make fewer mistakes and probably won’t lose face.
Give full consideration to most propositions that the Chinese make. Because
of the time involved in deliberating, failing to give full consideration to an
important issue is almost an insult. (Of course, you don’t have to consider
outrageous demands — see Chapter 6.)
Be careful about deadlines that you may need to commit to internally at your
company. A good guideline is to double how long you think a task may nor-
mally take. Don’t necessarily look at this additional time as being all bad,
though. Use the extra time to your advantage and research anything you’re
unsure of. Remember that being tactful wins you more points than screaming
at the Chinese because of delays.
203
Chapter 11: Understanding How China Works (and Doesn’t Work)
Chinese entrepreneurs on fast forward
Unlike the large and sluggish state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), businesses in the private
sector are used to getting things done at a
breakneck pace. Chinese entrepreneurs need
to get their products to market, build their com-
pany’s brand, and get their business to reach
economies of scale. They’re trendsetters for the
way business gets done today in China.
Entrepreneurs in China are on the move —
especially in China’s small- and medium-sized
companies. Don’t be surprised to hear com-
ments such as “we need to get this done
quickly” when working with Chinese entrepre-
neurs. Your business dealings with most private
sector firms will move forward at a faster pace
than with the SOEs.

Sending consistent messages
Foreign businesspeople are sometimes thought to be inconsistent in their
business dealings in China. Try explaining to the Chinese why your company
decides to go in a different direction — why new senior management who
have never been to China are now in charge of dealings in the country or why
your profit center is being combined into another business unit within the
company. Don’t be surprised if you get a lot of blank stares and silence from
the Chinese when telling them about changes in your China plans.
The Chinese are usually consistent in their messaging with foreigners
because of their consensus style of management, which requires them to
work together internally to arrive at the right answer together. They all seem
to be going in the same direction.
Make sure you’re consistent in your dealings with the Chinese. That means
that everyone in your company who deals with the Chinese needs to have the
same goals and objectives for China. Everyone has to follow the same plan.
You don’t want to show the Chinese that you have conflicting views within
your company, which indicates disorganization. Be careful because the
Chinese often try to take advantage of internal conflicting views and lack of
harmony (see Chapter 6 for tips on negotiating). The Chinese will be watch-
ing every word you say that may be of advantage to them.
Being consistent means that you also need to get a good read on what 
the Chinese are saying to you. Take careful notes at all your meetings, and
review them as a group afterward. It’s a good idea to provide the Chinese side
with a summary of your meeting notes for review to reduce the number of
misunderstandings.
Sharing information
The senior Chinese business leader in charge manages and controls most of
the information you receive. The Chinese are careful about sharing informa-
tion or asking questions because they don’t want to make a mistake that may
cause them to lose face. The Chinese would rather hold their questions or
comments for later and then sort things out internally before approaching
you. They ask you to explain your view instead of asking specific questions.
Don’t brainstorm or try to share ideas with the Chinese. Instead, listen 
carefully for clues on how the Chinese want to proceed. Don’t be shy about
asking the questions you need answered — just make sure you don’t ask
them the first time you meet the Chinese side. You may find common ground
or understand how far you are apart in your thinking.
204
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

Many things may be communicated to you through other means. Sometimes,
single representatives of the firm or a trusted middleman who has a good
relationship with the Chinese company may give you an important piece of
information at another time.
Don’t give away important information about your firm’s products or serv-
ices. You can share appropriate information after you’ve struck a deal with
the Chinese.
Keeping the dialogue going 
despite bumps in the road
Sometimes you think you’re doing all the right things with the Chinese and
then your discussion seems to fall apart. Perhaps internal approvals haven’t
yet been secured, your business partners are talking to your biggest competi-
tor, or things are stalled with the local government politician who needs to
give it his blessing.
Much of the time, the reasons remain a complete mystery. You can’t expect
the Chinese to tell you what you can do differently to improve your position.
However, if the Chinese are committed to working with you, they’ll likely keep
the dialogue going with more negotiations. And if you have friendly relations
with some key people, they may confide in you. Or an intermediary may be
able to assist you in getting to the bottom of things. For more on unblocking
strategies and negotiating with the Chinese, please see Chapter 6.
By now, if you have a contingency plan, you’re likely looking at alternatives to
your current plan. But if discussions look precarious, don’t give up just yet.
Some firms wait to see whether they have a chance for a breakthrough. If
you’re still waiting after a year or more to get approvals from the govern-
ment, you probably want to make one last attempt at getting discussions
going again before packing your bags and heading home.
Talking to the right authorities
Especially in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the highest-ranked person you
meet with may not have the decision-making power. A more junior Chinese
businessperson may instead be a senior-ranking Party member, and the most
senior Party official involved always trumps all other players. Be careful in
your dealings with all business leaders you meet. Sometimes, you never find
out which one is the senior Communist Party leader!
When dealing with privately-owned companies, the owner is often the deci-
sion maker. Although he or she may try to develop a consensus internally,
205
Chapter 11: Understanding How China Works (and Doesn’t Work)

the owner makes the final decision. You may be wasting your time speaking
with somebody else when you’re dealing with a private company.
Getting to know who’s in charge isn’t usually too complicated. Because the
Chinese are so focused on understanding the leadership structure of the dele-
gation or group, they give you obvious clues about who’s in charge on their
end. The senior person and key decision maker from the Chinese side generally
leads the discussion at the meeting. And if you’re sitting across a meeting room
table, the person opposite the leader of your delegation is the Chinese leader.
Making Face-to-Face Business 
Meetings Work for You
Communicating face-to-face is best because it helps build trust. By formally
meeting with your new Chinese friends, you can hopefully create guan xi
(right relations — see Chapter 15). You can later arrange one-on-one meet-
ings with your business partners, and over time, you can bypass a lot of the
formal meetings and do more business directly with your counterpart at the
Chinese company.
Because formal business meetings in China can open up communication,
they take on a new meaning for foreign visitors. Conducting business at
formal meetings involves a lot of protocol, as the following sections explain.
Getting your basic presentation ready
Having your presentation ready before you arrive in China is the best way to
get organized. Your presentation must be in English and Chinese (usually
Mandarin) and be easy to understand. Make sure that the Chinese version of
the presentation is correct and clearly explains your company’s point of view.
(See the info on translators in Chapter 2.)
The following sections explain what to cover in your first presentation and
what format to use. We explain delivery in “Making a presentation,” later in
this chapter.
Content
Make the presentation short and sweet and you’ll likely deliver the message.
Within 10 to 15 pages, your first presentation should explain the following:
 The history of your firm
 The market you serve
206
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

 Your products and/or service
 Your main channels of distribution
 How many people you employ
 Other relevant details of your business
If you have experience in China or other parts of Asia, your presentation
should say so. Tell your Chinese business partners if you already have experi-
ence in buying or selling products in Asia — for example, if you export prod-
ucts from California to Tianjin.
If your company does business with a well-known or particularly large or suc-
cessful company, such as one of the Big Three automotive companies, be
sure to tell the Chinese about that relationship. They’d like to know about
your high-profile clients or suppliers.
If you have an impressive building as your headquarters, show it off with an
appropriate picture in your presentation. You don’t necessarily have to own
the place — the fact that you occupy a significant business building is good
enough. An impressive headquarters indicates that your company is highly
successful and may be worth doing business with.
Mode of delivery
You can share information about your company by using handouts.
Distribute the handouts as you start your presentation. Bringing along some
company brochures or your annual report in English may help, too. The
senior leadership may not be able to read English, but some of the junior
people can give them the highlights of your handouts at a later time.
Consider sending your presentation to your hotel in China by express mail
service before your visit. Some foreign visitors like to bring copies of the pre-
sentations with them on the flight. That way, there’s no chance of losing
them. Depending on where you’re staying, you can get copies made at the
business center at your hotel; however, you should first ask the business
center whether they can print color documents. China’s more developed
cities have some copy centers, but they’re not that widespread yet.
In more formal meetings, don’t expect to break out a flashy PowerPoint pre-
sentation to kick things off. For less formal meetings in the private sector,
making a PowerPoint presentation may be appropriate. Some of China’s more
sophisticated companies may make PowerPoint presentations, too. Check
with your Chinese contacts before considering this option because you may
have to make special arrangements well in advance.

Chapter 11: Understanding How China Works (and Doesn’t Work)

Preparing to speak the local 
business language
China boasts many regional dialects, which are more like different languages
than the differences you’d notice between the speech of an American and a
Briton. English and Cantonese are the official languages of Hong Kong,
although many people there speak some level of Mandarin these days.
Cantonese is one of the most common dialects in the south.
In the mainland, apart from Hong Kong and Macao, most business meetings
are conducted in Mandarin, the official language of China. In Chinese, this
dialect is called Putonghua (pronounced poo-tong-wha; ordinary speech). For
you, it’s anything but ordinary! The good news is that you’ll likely be doing
business in English with translation into Mandarin. If you normally speak a
language other than English, you generally need to find a specialized inter-
preter or speak in English.
Even if you have no Chinese skills at all, try to say a few words in Chinese.
The Chinese will appreciate even a feeble attempt, so put aside your ego or
self-consciousness. Just saying hello in Chinese (ni hao; pronounced nee
how) is a step in the right direction. For some more Chinese phrases, see the
Cheat Sheet in the front of this book. And for more information on Mandarin,
check out Chinese For Dummies, by Wendy Abraham (Wiley).
Making an appointment
Setting up business meetings in China requires some advance planning. This
section tells you a bit about scheduling the meeting and making sure your
Chinese partners are prepared.
Setting a date and time
Your first step in planning a meeting is choosing the date. First of all, don’t
make any appointment when Chinese New Year is coming up. This holiday
can fall in January or February. No business is conducted during the Chinese
New Year week-long holiday (though Hong Kong and Macau celebrate the
Chinese New Year over three days only). Also, business is usually very slow
the week before Chinese New Year and a couple of weeks after. (For informa-
tion on how you can celebrate the holiday in China, see the nearby sidebar).
Besides Chinese New Year, avoid two other major Chinese holiday periods.
Labor Day starts a week-long holiday beginning May 1. The other big holiday
period is the week-long National Day celebration from October 1 to 7. Business
gets done right up to and just after these two holidays, unlike Chinese New
Year.

Business hours in China are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. from Monday to
Friday. You may be able to arrange for a Saturday morning meeting, but you
should do so only if you can’t get a weekday appointment. Government
offices generally have internal meetings on Friday afternoons, so don’t sched-
ule any meetings involving government officials at that time.
Meetings tend to be about as long as you’d expect elsewhere. They can be as
long or short as necessary. Keep these points in mind when scheduling your
meeting:
 You want to avoid canceling any appointment you make with the Chinese,
so make sure you can honor the plans before you set up the meeting.
 Stagger the timing of your appointments while visiting your Chinese con-
tacts. That way, you build in a time buffer in case an earlier meeting goes
into overtime.
 As congested as most Chinese cities are, you need to build plenty of
travel time into your schedule. (Please see Chapter 5 for info on travel-
ing in China.)
Your business partners may invite you to a Chinese lunch after a morning
meeting. That lunch may end up being a midday Chinese banquet (see
Chapter 16). If you’re not going to lunch with the Chinese, be sure to con-
clude your meeting before the lunch hour, around noon. Working lunches —
in which everybody sits around the table and continues the meeting — don’t
exist in China. Also, people are often unavailable to speak by telephone during
their lunch hours.

Chapter 11: Understanding How China Works (and Doesn’t Work)
Celebrating Chinese New Year
Chinese New Year is the biggest holiday in
China. Often called the Spring Festival, Chinese
New Year is considered the start of the spring
season. The date is based on the Chinese lunar
calendar, so the holiday takes place at a differ-
ent time each year.
Chinese New Year is a great time for business
partners, friends, and families to celebrate
together. Many people share food, drink, and
gifts during this special Chinese holiday. You
and your business can join in the festivities of
Chinese New Year in several ways:
 Treat your Chinese friends to a celebratory
meal a couple of weeks before the official
holiday.
 Send Chinese New Year cards to your
Chinese contacts.
 Select an appropriate gift for your Chinese
friends (see Chapter 16 for info on giving gifts).
But don’t plan on traveling to China to do busi-
ness during this time. It would be like trying to
make business deals on Christmas or New
Year’s Day!

Always set up and confirm the meeting place and time by fax, e-mail, or tele-
phone. As you get closer to the meeting date, follow up and double-check on
things.
Choosing a location
Making appointments in China generally means meeting the Chinese at their
offices. The Chinese pay a lot of attention to their surroundings. They believe
that a location’s feng shui (fung-shway) may have a direct bearing on the suc-
cess or failure of their business. Feng shui translates to wind and water; it’s a
Chinese way to seek harmony, balance, and energy through the arrangements
of objects, buildings, plantings and more. (For more info on feng shui, check
out Feng Shui For Dummies, by David Kennedy, and Feng Shui Your Workspace
For Dummies, by Holly Ziegler and Jennifer Lawler.)
If you have to arrange the location to meet the Chinese during your visit, keep
in mind that surroundings are important. For an appropriate meeting place,
you should be fine at any upscale meeting room in an upscale Western hotel.
Just make the reservation for a room that meets your needs as you would at
any hotel. Or if you happen to have your own office or shared business office
in China, you can invite the Chinese to meet with you at your office, but do so
only if your office location is highly desirable and can give your company lots
of face. Don’t meet in the hotel lobby, your room, or any bar.
Communicating your objectives
To prepare everyone for the business discussions, clearly communicate your
objectives for the meeting to the Chinese well before you walk in. You can
include your goals in a fax or do it verbally when you make the appointment.
You don’t, however, need to go into the specifics of the meeting. Meetings in
China generally don’t follow a formal agenda.
Making a respectful entrance
The Chinese place a lot of emphasis on protocol, and it extends to how your
group enters a meeting. The following sections can help you communicate
certain important signals to the Chinese party.
Getting there
Being late is disrespectful, so plan to arrive early. Your entire group should
arrive together. If you’re early, you can just wait outside if weather allows
until it’s time for the meeting. Being late — or even worse, not showing up for
the meeting at all — can damage your relationship.
Finding the office location can be a bit of a challenge. Getting directions in
advance can go a long way toward making your life easier. Allow yourself
plenty of time to get there, and be sure to have a mobile phone so you can
210
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

call or send text messages to your Chinese contacts if you’re running late
(see the upcoming section “Communicating Effectively Outside the Meeting
Room” for details).
In major cities, street signs are in Chinese and English, but the English trans-
lations aren’t always correct. Make sure that you have clear directions and/or
an address before you get in a taxi, and don’t let the taxi go until you’re cer-
tain that you’ve arrived at the right address. (See Chapter 5 for info on get-
ting around China.)
Asking your Chinese host for directions to your next appointment may not be
a good idea. You don’t want to share this type of information if you’re meet-
ing with one of their competitors! But if you’re going to see your lawyer, for
example, seeking some help is perfectly all right.
Entering the room and introducing yourself
The Chinese you’ll be meeting with may already be waiting in the meeting
room. As soon as you and your company representatives arrive, a representa-
tive of the company guides you to the meeting room. The senior person for
your company should be the first to enter. The senior Chinese leader then
welcomes your company leader.
Introduce yourself to as many people as possible before the meeting starts,
and shake hands with both men and women. Usually, the higher ranking lead-
ers are busy meeting each other, so not everyone meets at once. You may not
meet everyone, and that’s okay. The introductions can sometimes be a bit
awkward because many Chinese people are shy and won’t necessarily intro-
duce themselves to you while you’re milling around.
Exchanging business cards at the beginning of the first meeting is customary
for the leaders and the rank and file (see the info on greeting and meeting the
Chinese in Chapter 16). Often, exchanging cards with everybody in the room
is impossible. Formally introducing yourself to somebody at the end of the
meeting is okay, too, but do so quickly because meetings can sometimes end
before you know it.
Keep the business cards you’ve exchanged on the table in order to keep track
of who’s who.
Finding your seat
In more formal business meetings, you use a large, well-appointed meeting
room. The room is set up in a U-shape, with many comfortable armchairs and
tables for setting down your tea. Leaders sit at the end, with Westerners on
one side of the room and the Chinese on the other.
The Chinese leader guides the senior person from your company to his or her
proper seat. The leaders sit across from each other, with a small table between
them. Then the second-highest-ranking leader from your company sits on the
211
Chapter 11: Understanding How China Works (and Doesn’t Work)

other side of your senior leader. This process continues until you’re all seated
based on your rank in the firm. The Chinese side does the same so that equally
ranked people end up across from each other on opposite sides of the room.
(Note: Your interpreter should sit just to the right of your leader.)
Instead of being in a reception-type meeting room, you may be in a typical
meeting room where everyone lines up in rank order opposite one another
(Chapter 2 can tell you more about rank). Thus, the group leader from the
Chinese side sits across from your company’s leader and so on down the line.
Meetings with privately owned companies put less focus on formalities of
who sits where, especially when you’re dealing with younger management or
managers who’ve been educated or worked overseas. Just let the Chinese
guide you to where they want you and your team to sit.
Taking time for tea
Tea is a part of doing business (and enjoying life) in China. When you arrive
at a business meeting, you nearly always receive hot tea, usually green tea in
a small cup with a lid. The Chinese don’t add anything to their tea, so don’t
ask for cream or sugar.
You can certainly wait until the tea cools off before taking a sip. That way, the
tea leaves sink to the bottom of the cup and don’t get in your way. Of course,
accidentally swallowing the tea leaves is okay. You don’t need to finish the
tea, but be polite and take at least a few sips during your business meeting.
If you finish your cup, someone may come by and refill it with fresh hot
water. Unlike lower-quality tea bags, loose tea leaves can be used several
times and still remain fresh. Be aware that the longer you let the leaves steep
before you drink, the stronger the flavor will be, so if you aren’t a tea fan,
drink early so you don’t look rude.
Making small talk
After the introductions are made and tea is served, some small talk is
common. Any small talk should be between only the two leaders. Small talk
can be about the weather, the wonderful hotel where you’re staying, what
day you arrived in China, and so on. In the meantime, the rest of the team
should just wait until the leaders are ready to get the meeting going.
Takin’ care of business
The first meeting with your Chinese contacts is more about getting to know
each other. You probably won’t get a lot of business done. Gradually, your
meetings become more productive. This change happens when the Chinese
side feels that they’ve gotten to know you better, can trust you and your com-
pany, and want to do business with you. This section explains a bit about
how business meetings generally progress.
212
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

Because of the fear of losing face, the Chinese rarely make significant deci-
sions during meetings. In most cases, you get the answer you’re looking for at
the next meeting.
Giving opening remarks
Here’s how meetings usually start:
1. The meeting formally begins when the leader of the Chinese group
welcomes the foreign leader and the rest of the visitors.
Your company leader follows with some opening remarks, too.
2. The senior leaders introduce their teams individually and explain
each person’s function within the company.
You don’t need to get too hung up on titles for the more junior members
of the team. In more casual meetings, each person may introduce him-
or herself.
3. The leaders exchange some broadly worded polite statements.
Open by saying how delighted you and your team are to have the oppor-
tunity to meet with the Chinese company’s leadership. Give the Chinese
side a turn to do the same.
4. You make a brief introduction of your firm to the Chinese.
Do so verbally before launching into any presentation, and allow the
Chinese side to introduce their company as well.
213
Chapter 11: Understanding How China Works (and Doesn’t Work)
All the tea in China
Tea drinking in China goes back thousands of
years. Tea was one of China’s first major
exports, and it remains popular in China to this
day. The Chinese love sharing this part of their
culture with others. Drinking tea is common in
all business dealings with the Chinese.
Eight different types of tea are harvested in
China: green, oolong, black, red, white, yellow,
flower/scented, and compressed. Within those
types are thousands of variations. Green tea,
the most common tea offered to foreign visitors,
is the most natural class of tea. It’s dried by heat
only and doesn’t undergo a fermentation
process. Green tea’s taste tends to be light,
slightly bitter, and possibly grassy. It has very
little caffeine. Westerners are usually more
accustomed to black tea, which is fully fer-
mented, making it full-flavored and dark.
Tea is valued not only for its taste but also for its
supposed medical benefits. Green tea is loaded
with antioxidants and is said to lower total cho-
lesterol levels, improve your ratio of HDL (good)
to LDL (bad) cholesterol, and aid your body in
fighting cancer, cardiovascular disease, and
infection. Some have found that black tea also
lowers LDL production and stroke risk in men.

Relying on an interpreter provided by the Chinese side isn’t a good idea.
Often the interpreters are recent students or young professionals who proba-
bly don’t know your business and its terminology. You want to make sure that
your presentation makes the impact you planned. Therefore, having your
own interpreter — someone you can work with fairly — is better for you and
your company. See Chapter 2 for details on interpreters.
Making a presentation
Hand out your presentation just before you want to start so the Chinese side
can read the Chinese version of your handout while they simultaneously listen
to the Chinese interpretation. The ultimate goal is to improve communication
with the Chinese and yourselves as much as possible. Bring plenty of extra
copies with you, because sometimes more people than you expect show up.
From here, the person representing your company needs to kick off the dis-
cussion. The Chinese side expects the foreigner to lead the presentation, and
they expect to follow you when you’re finished. In most first meetings with
the Chinese, your presentation is really about introducing your company,
explaining your business and the company’s history. Then you can begin to
launch into the reason why you’re there today to meet with the Chinese firm.
Be sure not to dominate the conversation with the Chinese when you first
meet them. Give them equal time to give you their company story, too.
The Chinese place a lot of emphasis on rank, so the two leaders do most of
the speaking and direct the discussion. Your company’s leader needs to speak
directly to the senior Chinese representative, so your leader should turn to
face the senior Chinese leader, not the rest of the group or the interpreter.
Your leader sets the stage for discussion by introducing general concepts
first. As he or she gets into the specifics, the leader can hand off a portion of
the presentation to a technical expert. Use your team wisely to make the
maximum positive impact on the Chinese — show off your company’s exper-
tise! Asking other team members to speak also allows each side to get to
know who the subject matter experts are. However, remember that speaking
up at a business meeting without being asked to do so by the company leader
is disrespectful.
As the leaders converse, the others from your company can use the time
wisely by taking notes about what the Chinese are saying and doing. Chinese
businesspeople take careful notes at meetings with foreign visitors so they
can recall what you’ve said for their benefit later.
Using interpreters wisely
A lot of business communication depends on using your interpreter well. We
discuss finding interpreters in Chapter 2, but here’s some advice on speaking
through an interpreter during meetings:
214
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

 Stay away from difficult words, slang, and industry jargon. Avoiding
difficult English words or phrases gives your interpreter more time to
fully understand and translate what needs to be said. You’re better off
by speaking slowly and clearly in a Chinese meeting.
 Say only about two sentences at a time and then pause for a short
while. Your interpreter then has a better chance of getting the words
and concepts right.
 Make eye contact with your Chinese counterparts rather than with
your interpreter. Some people say that the Chinese can be distrustful of
people who don’t make eye contact.
 Don’t rush the Chinese response. Don’t be surprised if the Chinese side
chooses to pause and reflect on what’s been said during the meeting.
The Chinese often collect their thoughts before giving a reply to make
sure they’re giving an appropriate response.
 When in social situations or during meeting breaks, make sure your
interpreter doesn’t upstage you with the Chinese party. Your translator
should translate even idle chit-chat between you and the Chinese. The
translators should not be trying to impress themselves upon your
Chinese contacts. Keep them in line!
Never assume that the Chinese don’t understand English. Whether during the
meeting or a bathroom break, be very careful about what you say.
Wrapping up the meeting
When the meeting is over, say thank you to your Chinese contacts. (You know
when the meeting’s over because one of the leaders says so.) You can thank
the Chinese for their hospitality, the opportunity to get together, and the pos-
itive business discussions. Shake hands with all the Chinese on your way out,
and send a final message about working together to the senior Chinese who’s
in charge.
You and your company representatives leave the room first. You don’t leave
the meeting room with the Chinese. They often send one representative to
make sure you find your way out of the building or to the elevator.
Communicating Effectively 
Outside the Meeting Room
Because the Chinese value personal relationships, people prefer to do most
business in person. However, with mobile phone use in China growing by
215
Chapter 11: Understanding How China Works (and Doesn’t Work)

leaps and bounds, getting in touch with the Chinese by phone is becoming an
option. And other forms of electronic media, such as the Internet and text-
messaging, are creating more opportunities to communicate with the
Chinese, which is good for your business.
Using the telephone
People are doing more and more business on the telephone in China. Mobile
phone use in China is skyrocketing. (In China, they prefer the term mobile
phone to cellphone.) Mobile phone users in China now number close to 500
million, and around 50 million new mobile phone users are added each year
in China.
Don’t work by phone on important business matters unless it’s absolutely
necessary.
Reaching people in their offices
Reaching someone by the office telephone is difficult in China. Executives
often aren’t around because they’re too busy in face-to-face meetings all day.
Don’t be surprised if you don’t get through at all and the phone just contin-
ues to ring and ring.
Most senior Chinese businesspeople still rely on assistants to answer their
telephones at the office. However, trying to reach your contact’s assistant
isn’t easy, either. Get to know the office assistant — perhaps the assistant can
give you a direct line to contact him or her if you have a problem.
Calling and using mobile phones
Calling mobile phones is the best way to get in touch with your business 
partners in China. Rarely do Chinese businesspeople turn off their mobile
phones — even during business meetings! (You can set a good example by
turning off your own phone.) If you know your contacts well, you can call
them after business hours. Getting the mobile phone number of your Chinese
business contacts, though, can be tricky. They usually have to know you
pretty well.
Using your mobile phone in China may require you to make some changes to
your phone if you don’t have international roaming services before you go 
to China. Call your mobile phone provider at least a month before you leave
to find out whether you can unlock your phone for use in China. If you can
unlock your phone, you can use the services of a Chinese telecom carrier at 
a very reasonable cost. You buy a set number of minutes and can buy both
international and China roaming services.
216
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

When you’re in China, you can easily purchase a pre-paid SIM (Subscriber
Identity Module) card (called a SIM Ka) with cash in any major city to make
international and local calls through a Chinese telecom company. This way is
cheaper and easier than roaming. You can purchase a SIM card at conve-
nience stores, newspaper stands, and many other places. Be sure that you
have text messaging (SMS) service, too.
SMS and text messaging
China accounts for about half of text messages, or Short Message Service
(SMS) messages, sent globally. About 25 billion text messages are sent each
month in China. Over the Chinese New Year week-long holiday, more than 12
billion text messages were sent. No wonder some people call China the “thumb
economy”!
Young people in particular like sending SMS messages because it’s much
cheaper than making a call. Sending an SMS message in China costs about
US$0.01.
Many of your contacts may communicate with you by SMS in China. Where
you may expect to receive a voicemail or mobile phone call, you’ll likely get a
text message instead. Your Chinese contacts can send text messages in both
Chinese and English.
Faxing
Using a fax to communicate with Chinese businesspeople is usually pretty
reliable. Most large businesses have dedicated fax machines to handle
inbound and outbound faxes. Some companies are more organized than
others, so faxing documents to China may be more hit-or-miss than what
217
Chapter 11: Understanding How China Works (and Doesn’t Work)
Get the message: No voicemail
Believe it or not, Chinese businesspeople don’t
use voicemail. They don’t use it in the office.
They don’t use it on their mobile phones. They
don’t use it, period.
When Chinese people call you, they want to talk
to you. They don’t want to talk to your voicemail.
So in China, you either get through to the person
by phone or you don’t — but you can’t leave a
recorded message. Most Chinese people don’t
have voicemail systems at work or on their
mobile phone. If you can’t reach your contact by
phone, send a text message (SMS) instead of
continuing to call.

you’re used to. Make sure that you follow up with your Chinese contacts to
see whether they’ve received your fax.
Small- and medium-sized companies may have a phone that also does double
duty as the fax. If the phone number is the same as the fax, you may need to
tell your Chinese contacts to make sure the fax machine is on.
E-mailing and the Internet
China has more than 100 million Internet users. About 80 percent of China’s
Internet users are under the age of 35 with a large number of them being stu-
dents. Still, although e-mail is popular among Chinese Internet users, the
mobile phone is the emperor!
With so much focus on personal interactions, China’s use of e-mail is more
limited than elsewhere (especially for older Chinese, who are more comfort-
able doing business face-to-face and sending documents by fax). You can’t
convey body language and tone of voice, so when communicating by e-mail,
be especially careful to keep the big words and jargon to a minimum.
You can usually get high-speed Internet access from your hotel either in your
room or at the business center without a problem, so bring along your laptop
to stay connected. Many Western restaurants offer free wireless Internet
access as well. Internet cafes do exist, but being in your hotel is a lot more
comfortable (and usually much less smoky). The Coffee Bean offers free wire-
less Internet access in its China stores; Starbucks requires users to buy a pre-
paid card to use wireless.
Internet regulations in China may prevent you from accessing certain Web
sites (for instance, you won’t be able to access Wikipedia), which should
have little effect on your day-to-day business dealings in China. Your e-mail
communication to and from your office and locally in China shouldn’t be a
problem.

Sourcing from China
In This Chapter
 Finding and evaluating suppliers
 Concentrating on agreements with suppliers
 Watching out for sourcing pitfalls
 Ordering and shipping
C
hinese manufacturing has literally changed the world by lowering prices
on numerous goods. In many products and industries, China offers the
best combination of low prices and manufacturing capability in the world.
That’s not to say that China is the lowest-cost producer — it isn’t anymore.
China isn’t necessarily the highest-quality producer, either — that depends
on the industry. But China’s capabilities in a lot of areas are much better than
its low-cost competitors’ are.
You can get almost any product made in China. The trick is getting it made
well and delivered without incident. This chapter helps you find suppliers
and avoid common issues.
Understanding Why You May 
Want It Made in China
We can name three reasons to source production from China:
 Cost: Chinese factories are often able to produce for less because over-
head is cheaper and because they can use manufacturing models that
are newer and more efficient than in the West. China’s low-cost labor can
mean savings on labor-intensive goods.
 Capability: China is set up for business. It has good infrastructure, quali-
fied engineers, and thousands of companies ready to supply parts or
services. China can be a one-stop shop.

 Markets: Your company may want to someday sell in China. Setting up a
supply chain in China now can make selling much easier when the time
comes.
Just because you can get something made cheaper in China doesn’t mean
that sourcing from China is a good idea. Your product may cost a fortune to
ship. Poor-quality parts or the loss of intellectual property are important
intangible costs to think about. Outsource to China only when
Cost in China + shipping + other costs < cost at home
The best products to source from China are those that require a lot of labor
and/or that will be produced in high volumes. In most cases, products that
are entirely machine made should be made at home — the machine that
makes them will cost the same there as it does in China. Having custom jobs
or small batches done in China usually isn’t a good idea because China doesn’t
yet have an artisan class of skilled workers who take pride in producing short
runs of quality products. Most Chinese factory workers are best at simple
and repetitive tasks.
Working with Suppliers
You can work with two types of suppliers: factories and trading companies. 
A lot of the decision regarding which way to go depends on your product and
how much of a presence you can maintain in China. Whether you go with a
factory or trading company, you have to watch out for quality issues.
220
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 
Outsourcing, briefly
China offers selective opportunities for busi-
nesses to outsource certain functions. For
instance, a number of multinationals outsource
software development to China, which is where
China’s strength in outsourcing lies. However,
the software outsourcing market in China is
highly fragmented, with about 8,000 providers.
Only the 15 or so largest companies have more
than 150 people. Most firms are Chinese-owned.
China’s cost in this area is usually lower than
India’s, but depending on whom you ask, China
is 10 to 30 years behind India in developing its
outsourcing industry. The main reason is India’s
better English capability. As a result, China isn’t
as strong in business process or enterprise
application outsourcing as India is.
China does have a unique feature in the out-
sourcing market, though. In northeastern China,
a number of people are proficient in Korean and
Japanese. As a result, China is in a strong posi-
tion in outsourcing for those markets.

Finding suppliers
Finding suppliers in China is relatively easy. Finding good suppliers isn’t!
Ironically, China’s explosive growth has made good suppliers harder to find
because the market is flooded with so many poor operators.
You can find suppliers remotely, but you should always go to China to per-
form due diligence (DD). Here are a few ways to connect with suppliers:
 Ask for referrals. Hands down, the best way to find suppliers is to
receive referrals from people you trust. (For tips on networking, see
Chapter 15.)
 Peruse trade magazines for your industry. Just check out the ads and
the companies in the featured articles.
 Surf Web sites that have a good deal of suppliers from China. Three of
the better-known sites are www.alibaba.com, www.globalsources.
com, and www.tradenet.com.
 Attend trade shows. China has numerous industry trade shows, and
odds are that your industry has at least one trade show per year there.
The gargantuan Canton Fair takes place biannually, every April and
October (www.cantonfair.org.cn/en). If you’re thinking about going
to the Canton Fair, plan early! Hotels and flights fill up quickly.
The middleman: Surveying trade-offs 
of trading companies
Trading companies are middlemen between you and factories. Good trading
companies can add a lot of value. They often know the right supplier for your
product, manage the supplier, do quality control (QC), and pass along volume
discounts. Usually, trading companies have people who speak better English
than factories do, and they’re most accustomed to dealing with foreign 
customers.
Perhaps most importantly, a good trading company will make you whole (by
giving money back or ensuring you get the product somehow) when you have
problems with the order. Even good factories can have internal problems,
such as turnover issues, that you’re not aware of. A good trading company
that specializes in your industry can stay on top of these changes and seam-
lessly find new suppliers.
221
Chapter 12: Sourcing from China

Some people don’t like dealing with trading companies because they (some-
times incorrectly) think they can save their business money by dealing
directly with the factories. Not to mention, bad trading companies can cause
a lot of problems, too. Many trading companies are fly-by-night operations
that won’t be able to reimburse you if they have problems with the order.
These companies often don’t do QC and can end up costing you a decent bit
more than dealing directly with the factory would.
If you come across a trading company that first tries to pass itself off as a fac-
tory, run! A number of trading companies impersonate factories because they
want you to think they control the production process. These companies are
usually amateurish and lack the honesty to make you whole in event of a
problem.
If you’re considering dealing with a trading company, you want to ensure
three things:
 It has the financial strength to compensate you for problems.
 It’s well run.
 It’s not on your home government’s “restricted” list.
Operating on a shoestring budget is easier for Chinese trading companies
because the registered capital requirements for Chinese firms are lower than
for foreign ones.
222
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 
A trading company saves the day
A foreign-owned trading company was working
on a particularly large furniture project for a
new luxury hotel in the South Pacific. The trad-
ing company approved a sample for a teak chair
from a large Chinese factory. When the factory
completed the order of 1,000 chairs, the color-
ing of the teak was completely off. The trading
company suspected that the factory used infe-
rior wood, but the factory vehemently denied
any wrongdoing.
Instead of allowing the customer to be inconven-
ienced by the squabble, the trading company
immediately found another factory to produce
the chairs. The other factory was backlogged
with orders, so the trading company paid a lot
of its own money to go to the front of the queue.
The second factory then produced the chairs on
time and to specification.
Even though the trading company had to find
another factory, was out its deposit on the infe-
rior chairs, was out a lot of money to the second
factory, and was gearing up to do battle with the
first factory, the customer never knew there
was any problem!

Do due diligence (DD) on trading companies. View their business license (see
Chapter 17), which shows their registered capital; the more registered capi-
tal, the likelier the company is to be financially strong. Visit the trading com-
pany’s offices and apply a common-sense test. The Chinese are very much
into appearances, so if they can’t make the company look decent, you have
little hope that it actually is. You should also ask for a customer list and do
some cross-checking.
Straight from the source: Dealing 
directly with factories
Factories may be able to give you lower prices than you’d get from many
trading companies. Also, starting a factory takes more money than starting a
trading company, so the factory you work with is less likely to fold unexpect-
edly. You must still do on-site due diligence (DD) on factories, however, just
as you should with trading companies. The following sections explain what
factory DD and quality control (QC) involve.
Factories in the same locale often produce similar goods at similar quality
levels and have similar levels of customer service. If you can’t find anyone
who knows the particular factory you’re considering, see whether people can
give you a sense of the reputation of factories in the area.
Completing factory due diligence
Due diligence doesn’t do much good if you see the factory when it isn’t hum-
ming, so tour the factory when it’s in the middle of a production run. Make
sure your senior technical person participates in the DD.
In most cases, factory inspection isn’t rocket science. Here’s a basic checklist
of items to focus on when you tour a factory:
 Cleanliness: Appearances count for a lot. If the workers, managers, or
the factory appears sloppy, assume that attitude carries over into their
products — especially with electronics.
 Organization: See the entire process — from where materials come in to
how they’re processed into products to how and where they’re stored.
Think about whether the workflow makes sense and is efficient. If some
things don’t make sense, ask questions. If you still can’t figure out why
the factory is doing something a certain way, that’s a red flag.
223
Chapter 12: Sourcing from China

Pay particular attention to where finished goods are stored and shipped
from. You certainly don’t want any of your order to go missing or be
placed on the wrong container!
 Machinery: Have someone at the factory tell you about the machines.
What exactly do they do? How old are they? What are the brands? Where
did they come from? How much maintenance is required? Does the fac-
tory have the equipment to cover all stages of the production process?
The answers may mean little in and of themselves, but you may under-
stand some important points if you compare factories (which you usu-
ally should). Plus, asking questions sends the message that you pay
attention to details.
 Quality control (QC): Ask to see the data on the QC inspections on
incoming materials. You may also want to inspect the factory’s suppli-
ers, depending on the type of inputs. Factories can also have QC inspec-
tions at various points throughout the production process. Finished
goods should always undergo at least some inspection.
Regardless of how many QC checkpoints the factory uses, the location
of the checkpoints and where and how the failed parts are handled
should be clear. If that information isn’t clear to you on a walkthrough, it
likely isn’t clear to the workers, either!
Some factories may have received certain process certifications, such 
as ISO 9000 and 9001. If you’re interested in the factory’s certifications,
make sure they actually follow the certification requirements in every-
day production.
 Employee conditions: Make sure the factory isn’t using prison or child
labor. Ask to see the employees’ cafeteria and dormitories. You shouldn’t
expect the Four Seasons, but the dorms should be clean and orderly.
Find out how long the employees have for lunch and how long their
shifts are. Ask about what training the employees receive. See whether
the factory offers much of a career path for them. Happy employees do
their jobs better and are less likely to cause production delays and qual-
ity issues through turnover.
 Location: You want to understand and evaluate the factory’s location for
three reasons:
• Utility quotas: Limits on electricity can be especially problematic —
particularly for factories in and around big cities. You want to
assess the area’s utility reliability and whether the factory has
backup facilities. Water may also be rationed in certain areas.
• Closeness to suppliers: If the factory’s suppliers aren’t that close,
really pay attention to the inventory — try to figure out whether
224
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

they keep enough raw materials on hand to deal with an unexpected
supply bottleneck.
• Proximity to a port from which they can ship you the goods: You
obviously don’t want a backup on the way out of the factory, either.
Doing your own quality control
When a factory is producing your order, being there to do your own QC is
best. If you’re big enough, you can maintain an office in China that does onsite
QC during production runs. These offices can look for new suppliers, too.
Foreign companies that don’t have China offices commonly send people to
China during production runs. These employees do constant QC at the suppli-
ers’ factories, often for several weeks at a time. For higher-end goods, have
somebody from your company live at the factory 24/7 during production runs.
Be careful if you send a low-paid employee to do QC — buying off somebody
earning only US$300 per month isn’t that hard. Inspect the products before
they’re packed for shipment. Also consider doing a loading and stowage
inspection for the first few shipments so you can be sure the goods are prop-
erly loaded into the container. When you receive your shipment, check both
the quantity and quality of what you receive.
If you’re unable to have someone live at the factory during production, note
that some companies specialize in QC (as well as factory DD). Some are good,
but others may take kickbacks from the factories. You can find QC/DD compa-
nies on the same trading Web sites where you find factories and trading 
companies.
Following Tips for Supply Agreements
The number of large multinationals that don’t do a great job with their supply
agreements is surprising. You do have to make your agreements as concise and
clear as possible (if you hand potential suppliers documents as thick as the
Bible, no one will sign them); however, you shouldn’t skimp on some areas. 
The tips that follow don’t make for a complete contract in and of themselves.
Rather, these are areas where companies often mess up their contracts.
Avoid using the supplier’s contract, which is likely one-sided and full of
potential pitfalls. Make sure you negotiate the final contract.
225
Chapter 12: Sourcing from China

Product description
Closely and carefully describe the product you want, referring to any samples
you’ve already approved (hopefully by mutually signing and dating them).
If you don’t yet have approved samples, state that the product must be
exactly like (or similar to, depending on the product) the samples that you’re
going to approve. In that case, write the sample approval process into the
contract. Also, make sure you describe the quality of the product. If you have
detailed prints and designs, reference them in the contract. The more spe-
cific, the better protected you’ll be.
Delivery date
You want to specify the date on which the products should be delivered.
Putting in a penalty for late delivery — for example, $100 per day late — is
often a good idea. You may not want to actually enforce the penalty, though,
which can lead to other problems (such as the supplier’s cutting corners).
However, the penalty is there as a disincentive for late delivery, and you have
the option of enforcing it.
Payment terms
The agreement should clearly state what payment terms you’ve agreed to.
Also, as we discuss later in “Placing Orders,” your agreement should usually
state that the supplier will pay all miscellaneous fees and expenses involved
in getting your goods onto the ship. Use the phrase including without limita-
tion when specifying these costs in the contract.
Insurance
The agreement should state who will pay for cargo insurance. The terms of
sale determine who’s obligated to make arrangements for insurance. For
instance, if you buy FOB Shanghai (see the upcoming “Purchasing goods via
free on board arrangements” section), you’re responsible for insuring the
goods after they’re loaded on board the overseas conveyance.
226
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

No toxic substances
Remember that toxic substances can be a really big problem for your busi-
ness. Your supplier should agree not to use any toxic substances including
without limitation the ones we mention later in “Including substances that are
toxic to your business.” Do additional research to find out what other toxic
substances you should specify as prohibited.
Indemnification
Ideally, you can get suppliers to agree to broad indemnification. With broad
indemnification, suppliers agree to protect you against any and all costs, fees,
liabilities, losses, and so on that arise from their performance (or nonperfor-
mance) under the agreement.
In reality, few suppliers are likely to go for something that broad. You may
have to cap liability or limit indemnification to certain situations. You should
seek fairly broad indemnification for liability for their using toxic substances,
though. In addition, you may want to make them responsible for all costs and
legal fees for enforcing the contract.
If indemnification ever becomes a major sticking point in a negotiation, be
realistic about how much the supplier can actually afford to indemnify you
for. This provision doesn’t help anybody if the supplier ends up going bank-
rupt because of the indemnification.
Binding arbitration
You’re almost always better off having binding arbitration clauses in your
agreements in China. Protectionism is much less likely, you usually get a
more competent adjudicator, and arbitration is more transparent than with
Chinese courts. We discuss arbitration in more detail in Chapter 17.
Avoiding Pitfalls When Working 
with Suppliers
In simple terms, when you’re sourcing from China, you’re usually worried
about losing your money and/or getting bad or late products. Here, we dis-
cuss a couple of the more-common problems you can have when sourcing in
227
Chapter 12: Sourcing from China

China. Also, we go over the issues of intellectual property (IP) theft and toxic
substances, which can cost you a good deal more money than your deposit.
Not getting what you bargained for
The most common issue in sourcing is getting products that don’t actually
match the samples you approved. The best way to protect yourself is to keep
evidence of the approved samples. Make sure your supply agreement includes
the following approval process:
1. Request at least four final samples from the supplier.
2. Have the supplier sign and date all four samples.
3. After you approve the samples, sign and date all of them as well.
4. Give two of the samples to the supplier and keep the rest in a sealed
box or container (if they’re small enough).
5. Either have the seller date and stamp the sealed box with its chop
(official company seal) or go to a Chinese notary public to date and
chop the box.
If you have to go to arbitration or court (which we discuss in the “Binding
arbitration” section and in Chapter 17), you have evidence of what the
approved sample is.
You may also get something other than what you bargained for if the supplier
switches materials on you. Do a common-sense check on the price quote you
receive. If they’re charging less for the final product than what purchasing the
raw materials should cost, watch out! Depending on the product, you may want
to require that an independent lab certify the materials for each shipment.
Being outsourced: The factory’s factory
Another common problem is that your order gets outsourced (in part or
entirely) to another factory. Outsourcing is a problem because you’ve
inspected and approved a particular factory, but you have no idea what the
other factory is like. As a result, your product quality is hit or miss. When
doing DD on a factory, focus on whether it has machines that can produce
your product. The only other way to guard against outsourcing is to be at the
factory during production.
228
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

Losing your brand or technology
You’ve probably heard that intellectual property (IP) protection in China is
difficult. It’s true. If you have a good brand, you may put it at risk just by
speaking with potential suppliers. After you introduce yourself, they may
figure out that your brand is strong and trademark it themselves in China
(China doesn’t recognize foreign registered trademarks — see Chapter 17 for
details). Therefore, trademarking your brand in China before even looking for
suppliers is a good idea.
You’re also at risk of losing valuable technology or design. One thing that’s
key to protecting IP in sourcing is compartmentalization (see Chapter 17).
Have different factories produce different parts of the product, and make
sure that these factories aren’t located near each other and that they remain
as anonymous to each other as possible. If you do compartmentalize, closely
monitor how well each factory adheres to your specs. Otherwise, it may lead
to assembly issues, which can in turn lead to the factories’ blaming each
other for the problem.
If you may be exposing your brand or technology when speaking with a
potential supplier, first require them to sign a non-compete/non-disclosure
agreement.
Including substances that 
are toxic to your business
One issue that’s becoming big — and can put you out of business — is liabil-
ity for toxic substances in your products. You can have major liability even if
the substances are only in the inks! Here are some elements to watch out for:
 Cadmium
 Chromium
 Lead
 Mercury
These elements are fairly common in cheap toys and goods, so protect your-
self in your contract and through testing. Your supply agreement should
specifically exclude toxic substances. Your contract should also require the
supplier to fully indemnify you (be financially responsible) against all costs
and expenses incurred as a result of toxic substances in your products.
229
Chapter 12: Sourcing from China

The Europeans have a toxin-free standard for electrical equipment and elec-
tronics called the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive.
RoHS-compliant products cost a little more. Some customers think paying the
premium for RoHS products is worth the cost; some don’t. You can specify
that you want RoHS-compliant products in your contract.
Test the final products to make sure they don’t contain toxic substances. One
company that carries out this testing is the Société Générale de Surveillance
(SGS Group) (www.sgs.com). It has offices throughout the world and can test
in China and in many home markets. Each sample usually costs a few hun-
dred dollars to test and takes one to two weeks. Consulting with a product
liability attorney in your market to figure out how to best protect yourself
against liability for toxic substances (and other product liabilities) is also a
good idea.
Placing Orders
This section discusses the ordering process, which is fairly standard. As you
and the supplier get to know each other better, you’ll be able to get some
more favorable terms.
Putting down a deposit
The standard deposit for a new relationship in China sourcing is 30 percent.
As a supplier gets to know you better, they may reduce the deposit. In most
cases, you shouldn’t have to pay the deposit until you’ve approved the sam-
ples; however, if producing the samples is really expensive, you can deal with
the upfront costs in a couple of ways:
 Sign a purchase agreement stating that you’ll purchase a minimum
amount of product if you approve the samples.
 Pay for tooling costs (if they’re expensive) but have these costs offset
against your first order.
When you put down your deposit, always be ready to lose it and walk away.
Losing your deposit doesn’t happen often, but you shouldn’t be shocked if it
does. If the deposit’s large enough, you can pursue legal action — particularly
if your contract has an arbitration clause (see Chapter 17); however, a few
thousand dollars may not be worth pursuing.
230
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

Purchasing goods via free 
on board arrangements
The most common way of purchasing goods is free on board (FOB). FOB
[origin port name] means that the seller must deliver the goods on board a
ship (or airplane) at the port of origin. If you buy FOB, the factory delivers to
a freight forwarder that you choose (see the next section).
You can negotiate to have your suppliers handle freight forwarding arrange-
ments; however, we don’t recommend it. Many suppliers will look for the
lowest cost, which may lead them to use a fly-by-night forwarder.
Some goods, particularly electronics and chemicals, must be inspected and
certified at the origin port, a process that usually takes a day. With FOB, the
supplier usually covers all locally imposed fees and charges, including
inspection charges. Even though covering these expenses is customary for
suppliers, make sure you get that in your agreements!
Suppliers usually want to be paid in full before they load the container (in a
new relationship) or upon delivery to the port. You can try to negotiate this
point, though. From your standpoint, paying only after you receive and inspect
the products is best. A more realistic compromise in a new relationship may
be to pay when you can see the bill of lading. The bill of lading formally indi-
cates that that the carrier has received the goods.
Pay for the balance of your product through a letter of credit (LC) if the seller
agrees. Chapter 10 discusses LCs, which provide additional protection in
case of a problem with the product or delivery.
Shipping Your Products by 
Using Freight Forwarders
Freight forwarders receive your products at the port and send them on to the
destination. Finding freight forwarders located in your home country is easi-
est; they have either offices or agents in China.
When using international freight forwarders, breakage and pilfering don’t
happen too much. However, testing a new forwarder with a small shipment
first is best. Using a forwarder that has its own office at the origin port may
also be safer. Good freight forwarders usually differentiate themselves by
updating you on shipping schedule changes.
231
Chapter 12: Sourcing from China

One common issue with freight forwarders is that they often raise rates on
you after they have you as a customer. Shipping pricing varies by time of year
and availability of space, and forwarders look to take advantage of you espe-
cially during peak seasons.
Depending on the season, ocean shipping costs from China to the West Coast
of the U.S. are usually between US$60 and US$80 per cubic meter; getting
your cargo to the West Coast usually takes three weeks. For rush orders, 
you can also ship by air. As with other methods, shipping by air is seasonal,
with prices generally ranging between US$325 and US$500 per kilogram 
(2.2 pounds).
Deal regularly with at least two freight forwarders. This way, you can play
them off each other in terms of pricing.
If you cancel a shipment at the last minute, freight forwarders usually charge
a US$400 to US$500 penalty. Many suppliers agree to pay this penalty if their
failure to deliver on time causes you to cancel. Put this clause in your supply
agreement.

In This Chapter
 Why you should manufacture in China

 Taking care of quality control
I
n a broad sense, two manufacturing strategies for foreign-invested enter-
prises (FIEs) exist: producing for export and producing for the domestic
market. Your company may do both. Both producing for export and the
domestic market are challenging, and generalizing about how to execute
either is difficult because so much depends on individual circumstances.
In this chapter, we’re assuming that you already know something about manu-
facturing (if you don’t, you may want to think twice about setting up a factory
in China!). We talk about the major adjustments you should make when manu-
facturing in China. We also assume that if you’re manufacturing purely for
export, you know who your customers are; therefore, we focus our distribu-
tion discussions on producing for domestic markets.
Being Realistic about Savings
The first myth about doing business in China is that manufacturers will save
tons of money on labor costs. The average wage of Chinese factory workers
is a fraction of the wage of their Western counterparts, but remember the 
following:

 Wages depend on the industry, of course, but even in the West, labor is a
small portion of per-unit costs of many products.
 You often find a skills gap between the Chinese and Western workers, so
companies may have to throw more workers at a given task in China
than they do in the West.
 Manufacturing in China also has a lot of hidden costs, such as electricity
shortages and high labor turnover.
Most manufacturers overestimate how much money they’ll make initially. You
can reasonably expect that during the first two to three years, your company’s
per unit costs will be the same as in the West.
So why bother? Understand that you can manufacture a lot cheaper in China
than in the West but for different reasons:
 Utilities, rent, land, and other operating costs are usually a good deal
less than in the West.
 Because you don’t have “legacy” manufacturing models in China, you
can use newer and more efficient manufacturing methods there.
 Construction costs in China are also much lower than in the West.
 The high concentration of suppliers in certain parts of China helps keep
costs down, too (see Chapter 12 for info on suppliers).
Some companies get so fixated on reducing costs that they do the following
(it’s illegal, and you shouldn’t do it): They import fully-depreciated machinery,
spruce it up a bit, and declare it at inflated values. They then use the inflated-
value machinery as registered capital contributions (see Chapter 7), which
reduces how much they need to contribute and makes getting loans easier.
Perhaps most importantly, they get the tax benefit of re-depreciating the equip-
ment. Watch out if somebody tries to talk you into doing something illegal.
Considering Industry Development
Think about how developed your industry is before pursuing manufacturing
in China. Different industries are in different stages of development. For
example, the Chinese steel industry is world-class in terms of quality and
capability; the automobile industry isn’t really there yet. Foreign investment
has driven the development of some industries in China, such as telecom and
automotive. Other industries — such as steel and shipbuilding — develop
mainly because the government emphasizes them and focuses on building
infrastructure to support them.
234
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

If you have a manufacturing capability that isn’t developed in China, the situ-
ation offers both an opportunity and a risk. You can be one of the first in your
industry to take advantage of producing in China, thereby giving you a com-
petitive advantage. On the other hand, some of your technology and processes
will be copied if you’re an early mover into China. Also, you’re probably going
to have to put in a lot of effort training your workforce.
Entering a developed industry may be less painful because the government
should have a better understanding of what you’re doing, somebody else
already lost more IP than you likely will, and you may be able to find workers
with some experience in what you do. However, competition will already 
be tight.
Looking at Manufacturing Challenges 
for the Chinese Market
You can break manufacturing for the local market into two categories:
 Manufacturing inputs for goods that’ll be exported: If you’re an original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) for goods for export, your customers
are just as likely to be FIEs as Chinese. You may even be dealing with the
Chinese operations of some of your current customers. In any event, this
strategy is the less tricky of the two because you ordinarily have less
price pressure and may find it easier to differentiate your products
based on quality.
 Manufacturing items that’ll stay within China (the pure domestic strat-
egy): Assuming that you have Chinese competition for the domestic
markets (whether producing as an OEM or making finished products),
you’re likely going to be subjected to more price pressure while finding
that your potential customers aren’t that interested in paying more for
quality. The Chinese are beginning to pay more for quality, but this can
be a difficult strategy.
Many successful manufacturers ultimately do a combination. They first manu-
facture exclusively for export. Then they gradually begin testing the domestic
market’s waters.
This section discusses some of the challenges of manufacturing for the
Chinese market — whether for sale directly to consumers or to other 
manufacturers — and why you can overcome them.
235
Chapter 13: Manufacturing in China

Struggles to cut costs enough to 
compete in domestic markets
In most products and segments, the Chinese consumer market is very price
sensitive (see Chapter 14). This used to mean that purely domestic manufac-
turers needed to squeeze blood from turnips to cut costs.
Chinese companies are almost always going to be better at extreme cost-
cutting. They’re sometimes willing to cut corners in areas (such as working
conditions, intellectual property rights, and product quality) that FIEs aren’t.
Moreover, larger Chinese manufacturers may have costs of capital that are
lower than yours because they have strong connections with Chinese banks.
The below-cost financing situation is changing, but the fact still remains that
a number of Chinese manufacturers aren’t under the same pressure that you
are to generate a high profit margin.
Highly distributed distribution
Distribution in China is much more complicated than in most Western coun-
tries because Chinese distribution and logistics industries are geographically
fragmented. Although warehousing and distribution are improving along with
China’s infrastructure, they’re by no means comparable to the West’s. You
may need to deal with dozens of (if not more) transportation companies. 
(We discuss distribution in detail in Chapter 14.)
Think about who your customers are. Try to reach out to potential customers
to ask about their delivery requirements. Hopefully, they’ll tell you which
companies (or types of companies) they use to deliver their goods and sup-
plies. Also, speak with people within your industry to understand the distrib-
ution picture. Figuring out the distribution issues takes a while.
Why foreign manufacturers can succeed
The Chinese are becoming more quality conscious in some product cate-
gories (see Chapter 14 for details). However, even if you’re not manufacturing
for high-end mobile phones or other products where the Chinese will pay for
quality, you can still find opportunities.
236
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

Good service
Many Chinese manufacturers are still not great on the customer service side.
Some larger Chinese companies pay more to deal with suppliers that provide
them with good service. However, before you start planning to sell your com-
ponents on the basis of service, expect that you’ll need to be in the market
for a few years before you get much traction — after all, stability is part of
good service.
Quality, standardized products
In many cases, FIEs do standardized products better than Chinese manufac-
turers do. Pursuing purely domestic strategies is becoming easier because of
the small but growing demand for products that conform to international
standards (such as the International Organization for Standardization [ISO],
the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive [RoHS], and so on). Some
of the demand is the result of purely domestic manufacturers pushing for
higher quality, and some of it’s driven by government regulation.
Selecting Your Site
Site selection is crucial to your factory, but it’s commonly an area where com-
panies become fixated on one thing to the detriment of their overall business.
It plays a large part in determining whether you succeed or fail because it
affects (among other things) your ability to receive inputs, ship to customers,
and hire good workers.
Here are keys to site selection:
 Focus on the basics you need from a site as a manufacturer.
 Adjust to the unique circumstances of China — for instance, less reliable
transportation.
 Think about how comfortable you are with the local government (see
Chapter 8 for info on government relations).
 Look at how to use the regulatory framework — for example, Special
Economic Zones (SEZs) and tax incentives — to your advantage.
Hire a consultant to help you select a site. Make sure your consultant has
actually worked in manufacturing, though! Some consultants recommend
sites where they’re friendly with the local government or that have low taxes,
even though the sites aren’t practical from an operational standpoint. Find
consultants through recommendations from people who’ve done successful
startups in China similar to yours.
237
Chapter 13: Manufacturing in China

After you have a short list of possible locations, speak with similar-sized FIEs
in those locales — particularly those that are more recently established — to
get a feel for their experiences. Although you shouldn’t start by asking where
you can find the most accommodative government, you should make an early
effort to ensure that a local government won’t do a 180 on you after you’ve
committed your project money. A few short-sighted local governments can be
very difficult to deal with after you’ve paid for your land.
Seeing the big picture when 
planning your business
One of the biggest and most common mistakes that foreign manufacturers
make is to fixate on one thing when planning the business. For example,
many manufacturers come into China wanting to set up in the place that’ll
give them the lowest taxes. Although low taxes are obviously desirable, they
should be only one component of your overall strategy. When you focus on
one goal, your overall strategy and execution suffer. Remember to look at the
entire picture whenever you’re making a decision and to choose the option
that best balances all your goals.
Don’t make the mistake of starting with where you can get the most incen-
tives. Take care of your manufacturing basics first! Don’t focus on cutting
costs — instead, focus on maximizing profits.

Looking the part: Appearances can count
Chad Blackwell is managing director of Kunshan
Jieyang Arts & Crafts Co., Ltd. The company is
located in Kunshan, a small but rapidly expand-
ing city outside of Shanghai. As in many other
booming Chinese cities, industrial land is in high
demand.
Although Jieyang is a small-to-medium-sized
company in Kunshan, it was able to secure a
choice parcel for its new factory. Jieyang’s new
factory boasts an impressive and modern outward
appearance that faces the street. In addition to
the factory building’s attractiveness, Jieyang is
putting serious effort into landscaping, including
having a lot of grass and a small pond where the
parcel meets the road.
Blackwell is thrilled with the parcel because it’s
located at the intersection of two major roads
and is very close to a key highway. He believes
that if his company hadn’t made the effort to build
such a handsome factory, it may not have gotten
such desirable land from the government.

Remembering what smart 
companies look for
You’re unlikely to find any one perfect site, so you have to figure out how
best to balance the various pros and cons. Here’s a list of the key things you
want to make sure your site addresses.
Proximity to suppliers and/or customers
Smart companies start by asking where their customers and suppliers are.
Setting up in a place that offers the easiest access to at least one of those
groups simply makes sense, particularly in China, where transportation isn’t
always that reliable.
There’s a good argument to favor closeness to suppliers over customers:
Because China is growing so fast, supply bottlenecks are regular occurrences
in many industries. If you locate in the same town as your suppliers, you get
several advantages:
 You minimize the transportation time from suppliers.
 You reduce the amount of inventory you have to carry.
 You can develop closer relationships with your suppliers. Hopefully,
when supplies are tight, they’ll make sure that you’re the first to get
shipments.
239
Chapter 13: Manufacturing in China
Incentives may go, but the factory should stay
USActive is a Shanghai-based manufacturing
consulting firm whose employees have sub-
stantial manufacturing experience. Not long
ago, USActive assisted an auto components
manufacturer with selecting a site for a US$20
million factory near Shanghai. The client signed
an agreement with an industrial park to build
there. In the agreement, the local government
promised the client a number of tax and land
incentives. However, shortly after signing the
agreement, the central government announced
some changes to the tax and land laws. The
changes greatly reduced the value of the incen-
tive package.
Because USActive had focused on the basics of
its client’s business, the client was still pleased
with the site. The site is in a growing market and
is close to potential customers. It’s also near key
suppliers and major transportation networks.
Finally, the area has an ample labor pool, includ-
ing a good deal of qualified engineers.

The less skilled your workforce, the higher the quality of raw materials and
inputs you need. Keep this idea in the back of your mind when figuring out
where your suppliers are. Chapter 12 can help you find suppliers.
If your customers are in China, you wouldn’t want to set up in an Export
Processing Zone (EPZ). EPZs are special zones in China that give additional
incentives to export-oriented producers. If an EPZ company sells to a com-
pany located in China and outside of the EPZ, the transaction will cost an
additional few percentage points of the product’s price.
Reliable utilities
Smart companies look for reliable utility supplies. In some parts of China —
particularly near major cities — the government rations utilities during peak
demand periods. Peak demand for electricity occurs during the summer.
Ideal labor pools
Think about the local workforce. The government is offering all kinds of
incentives to “go west.” Unfortunately, workers in places like Chongqing usu-
ally need a lot more training than workers in the Shanghai area do. (Logistics
and transportation tend to be more complex and costly, too.)
Areas that have a lot of laid-off SOE workers offer experienced workers; how-
ever, some foreign investors believe that retraining former SOE workers is
harder than training laborers fresh off the farm.
Knowing how government can help
Interested local governments can add value by doing a good deal of hand-
holding while you set up. (See Chapter 8 for a comprehensive discussion of
developing government relations.) We use the word interested instead of good
because some large local governments may be good in terms of transparency,
speed, and fairness, but may not offer small investors as much individual
support.
China has a lot of regulatory red tape to deal with (see Chapter 7 and the
upcoming section on bureaucracy), but if a local government is really inter-
ested in having you invest, officials can guide you through the numerous
processes. They can also introduce you to various service providers, such as
construction companies.

Avoiding site pitfalls
Here are two big no-no’s when you’re looking at sites:
 Going for sites that have electrical poles on the land: The electrical
grid is a state-owned asset, and the local government doesn’t have the
authority to move those poles at its whim. Therefore, you may end up
owing the grid company a lot of money to move those poles. Check into
nonelectrical poles on the land, too. Local governments can move some
types of poles without a big deal; others take more work.
 Choosing sites that have people (usually subsistence farmers) living
on them: Local governments used to relocate residents (they suppos-
edly compensated them). However, this is now a hot-button political
issue in China. Many local governments are hesitant to relocate resi-
dents now. Either way, you should think twice about buying land that
could cause controversy with the residents.
Building Your Building
Constructing the factory may be the single hardest part of manufacturing in
China. You have to pay attention to a lot of details throughout the entire
process. Being overcharged and/or having quality issues with the construc-
tion aren’t uncommon.
Some foreign businesspeople believe that there’s a fine line between making
sure you’re not getting ripped off on your factory and pushing too hard on
cost control. Their thinking is that the builders are going to make some extra
margin one way or the other. Therefore, if you fight overcharges too much,
they’ll just cut corners to make it up. A good project manager (see “Protecting
yourself by hiring a project manager” up ahead) can help you control costs
while ensuring quality, but you may still be dealing with builders who are
determined to beat you.
Identifying the players
By law, you have to hire at least three different types of companies, all of
which must be licensed in China:
241
Chapter 13: Manufacturing in China

 A design firm, which designs the facility
 A general contractor (GC), which is in charge of overall construction;
some large GCs can finance the construction
 A supervisory firm called a jian li (pronounced jee-en lee)
The jian li’s role is technically to oversee the construction work. Some firms
are reasonably decent about this; others wouldn’t even notice if the structure
collapsed. In other words, you’re required to have a jian li, but don’t rely on it
to do your quality control — such work’s a bonus if it does. Most investors
hire a local jian li recommended by the local Construction Bureau.
Because the jian li can be unreliable, we highly recommend that you also hire
a foreign project management firm or have somebody internal who really
knows factory construction and can stay on site throughout the process.
Finding a general contractor
One way to find the general contractor (GC) is to ask the local government for
recommendations. Many local offices of the Construction Bureau carry out
annual surveys to rank local GCs, so you sometimes get very good recommen-
dations from the local government. Other times, you may receive a recommen-
dation to somebody’s friend’s company, which subsequently does a bad job.
You have to decide whether to hire a local GC or somebody from outside the
immediate area. Your selection of local GCs is more limited; however, a local
GC may be able to get permits a little faster because of its relationships with
the government. Also, it may have a shorter time rounding up workers because
it’s familiar with the area. Some foreign businesspeople think that the risk of
a GC’s taking your money and walking away from an incomplete project is
lower if the GC is local. (And in case you’re wondering, China has very few
foreign-owned construction firms.)
Contracting your GC
Foreign investors commonly have problems in their contracts in several
areas. The best thing to do is use your form of contract. Matter-of-factly tell
the GC that you’ll be using your contract, and make it seem like it’s not
optional. GC’s forms tend to be vague and give them a lot of wiggle room.
Here’s a list of pitfalls to watch out for in the contract process:
242
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

 Translation: If you use the GC’s contract, make sure you get a perfect
translation of it. You’d be surprised how many foreign investors get
badly hurt because of an error in the translation. It may pay to have a
couple of people translate the contract.
 Negotiation: If you use the GC’s form, they frequently tell you that the
contract is standard and that they can’t change it. Don’t believe them —
you can often find room to negotiate the terms.
 Security: Insist that the GC give you a performance bond or other secu-
rity. That way, if the GC screws up or walks away, you can immediately
get compensation. Try to shoot for security of at least 10 percent of the
construction cost (the usual range is 5 percent to 15 percent). The GC
will likely fight you hard on this — just don’t give up. Also, the GC is
likely to request that you provide security (such as a bank letter of guar-
antee) for your payment in return, a reasonable and customary request.
If you’re building a factory that’s new or unusual in China or to higher stan-
dards than what the Chinese normally build to, you need to make all these
standards explicit from the outset of discussions. When evaluating bids,
make sure that the special materials and tasks you require are specifically
stated in the estimate. Specify your standards and requirements as much as
possible in the contract. Finally, constantly verify that the builders are adher-
ing to your requirements — project managers (discussed next) can be helpful
here.
Keep thorough and detailed written records of all dealings with your builders.
Don’t rely on any handshake agreements — memorialize everything (espe-
cially alterations) in writing. Send notes of all meetings and phone calls to the
GC (if you send a translation, also make sure it’s perfect). Ask them to sign or
otherwise approve the notes.
If you’re not happy with the completed factory, do everything possible to
avoid giving the appearance that you accept it. After the factory passes
inspections, any building or completion issue becomes contractual (rather
than regulatory). Don’t give the GC the ability to argue that you initially
accepted known deviations from the contract.
Pay particular attention to flooring and electrical wiring. Although builders
may cut corners in a number of areas, these two can be critical. Make sure
that flooring is of the correct thickness. Also, make sure that the concrete is
proper quality — Chinese builders have a tendency to mix too much sand into
concrete. (You may want to ensure that you have a concrete expert on site.) If
your floor isn’t strong enough, you can end up spending a lot of money on
machine maintenance. Watch out for wiring tricks such as changing the gage
or putting aluminum wire inside copper casing to make it look like copper.
Incorrect wiring can cause a major setback by frying your equipment.
243
Chapter 13: Manufacturing in China

Protecting yourself by hiring 
a project manager
The biggest problem investors encounter in the construction process is qual-
ity supervision. A number of Western, Hong Kong, and Singaporean project
management companies are operating in China. Even if you have good jian li
(hired supervisors), project managers do a lot that jian li don’t have the
capability to. In addition to supervising day-to-day construction, project man-
agers implement financial and quality controls that can end up saving you a
lot of money and heartache.
Project managers aren’t cheap — they often cost in excess of US$100,000.
However, if you’re spending over a million dollars on your factory, they’re
probably worth it. As with anything else, you can find good managers and
not-so-good ones. Ask around for referrals before committing.
If your company has someone internal who really understands factory con-
struction and can be on-site for the entire length of the project, then you
don’t necessarily need a project manager.
Approvals: Getting through the Red Tape
Certain industries need specific permits. You likely need to jump through
these manufacturing-specific regulatory hoops.
Before construction
Before you build, you likely need to take the following steps in this order:
1. Get preliminary project approval from the local office of the State
Reform and Development Committee (SRDC) and get preapproval
from the local office of the State Administration for Environmental
Protection (SAEP).
2. Depending on your company’s industry and manufacturing processes,
SAEP may require you to file an environmental impact assessment
(EIA) report.
244
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

In the EIA report, you need to apply for discharge permits for pollutants
that your company will discharge. At the same time, you may be required
to produce Safety Assessment and Healthcare Assessment reports —
this also depends on your company’s industry.
3. Obtain the Construction Use Land Planning Permit and the Construction
Project Planning Permit.
The local land bureau issues the Construction Use Land Planning 
Permit, and the local office of the Ministry of Construction issues the
Construction Project Planning Permit. These permits are usually issued
pretty quickly — in some cases, as quickly as a few working days.
4. When you have your final environmental approval, the Construction
Use Land Planning Permit, and the Construction Project Planning
Permit (and the safety and healthcare approvals, if necessary), apply
for the final project approval from SRDC.
5. When you have the final project approval from the SRDC, get the
Business License from the local AIC.
We discuss the Business License in depth in Chapter 7.
6. After receiving the Business License, get the Land Use Rights
Certificate (also covered in Chapter 7).
Land Use Rights Certificates can take a few months to obtain.
7. After you cement the land, you have just one step before beginning
construction — getting the Construction Permit.
Submit the Land Use Rights Certificate, architectural drawings, and
some other items to the local office of the Construction Bureau. This
permit usually takes a few weeks to process.
Beginning operations
After you complete construction, the building has to undergo several sepa-
rate inspections, such as the construction quality, equipment safety, fire
safety, and environmental inspections. After it passes the inspections, you
receive the Occupancy Certificate. Now you can use the building.
Companies in a small number of export industries need an export permit
issued by the provincial office of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). The
Customs Bureau publishes a catalog that states which industries require
exporters to have a permit.
245
Chapter 13: Manufacturing in China

Hiring, Training, and Keeping 
Your Workers
Hiring and retaining good unskilled labor isn’t quite as hard as getting good
office workers. But despite China’s vast numbers of laborers, getting your fac-
tory workforce right may not be as easy as you think. You have to deal with a
large difference in capabilities between Chinese factory workers and those in
the West.
However, if you put the proper training and quality assurance systems in
place, you can have a top-notch operation in China. This section discusses
hiring and managing workers for a factory setting. For more general labor
information, please see Chapter 9.
Encouraging teamwork
The blunt approach to finding factory workers is to go to job fairs or contact
the local labor bureau. However, the smart approach is usually to hire shift
and production managers first. Then have each manager hire his or her team.
(When hiring production and shift managers, you should thoroughly test
their mechanical abilities and reasoning. See Chapter 9 for tips on evaluating
job applicants.)
Hiring managers who then hire their own teams means that the teams will
likely work well together. The downside to teams is that if you lose or fire one
team member, you’re likely to lose the entire team. Closely-knit teams of
workers often stick together.
Chinese workers tend to have an us-versus-them mentality. Often, “them” is
the foreign employer. You can redirect those attitudes, instead having teams
who work the same shift compete against one another: Simply give small
rewards and recognition to the better-performing team. This technique has
the advantage of putting some of the workers’ negative energy to good use.
Also, this system creates incentives for the teams to handle problems inter-
nally instead of having the factory management deal with them.
Expecting skills gaps
Be realistic about the capabilities of your unskilled workers. In the West,
unskilled workers usually have some mechanical aptitude. In China, that’s
often not the case. Unskilled workers often come straight from the farm,
246
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

where they’ve had little — if any — experience with machinery (these farms
are mostly manual). Workers who haven’t had exposure to machines often
find many mundane factory tasks challenging.
In addition, unskilled Chinese workers are often educated only through the
sixth grade or so. You should expect that the farther you go into China’s inte-
rior, the less skilled the workers will be (although the labor will be cheaper).
Training
In general, expect a worker to take at least two to three weeks to come up to
speed on operating a simple machine. Often, factories have team or produc-
tion managers train new hires. Training how to use the machines isn’t always
the hardest part.
Drumming up enthusiasm for your corporate culture
Chinese factory workers generally don’t know anything about your brand or
your corporate culture unless you teach them. When starting your factory,
having more than just machine training is critical. You should have human
resources and other people meet with workers and teach them about the cul-
ture of your company.
Without selling the culture to the workers, you’ll likely have a Chinese-style
factory in China that won’t help your brand and won’t communicate or work
well with your home offices. A number of Western companies have had to
completely revamp their China factories because the workers didn’t receive
adequate cultural indoctrination.
Start up your factory under managers who’ve been with your company for a
long time and who understand it very well. Consider having some of your
most senior managers in China for startup and for your several years or so 
of operations.
Providing safety and environment training
Chinese workers need a lot of training on safety and environmental issues.
(We talk more about managing your company’s safety and environmental
risks in Chapter 17.) Most of your Chinese hires don’t understand moving
parts or electricity very well. They’ll often take careless risks, such as not
replacing safety guards on machines or welding without a visor. You need to
repeatedly train workers on even basic safety precautions.
247
Chapter 13: Manufacturing in China

Train your workers how to dispose of wastes properly. If you don’t explain
these things upfront, don’t be surprised to find out that workers have been
pouring waste into the river or ground. Many of China’s environmental regu-
lations are tougher than the U.S.’s, so be proactive about teaching the proper
ways of handling environmentally sensitive materials so your workers don’t
get your company into serious trouble.
Treating your workers well
Worker turnover can be one of the largest hidden costs to manufacturing in
China. If you want to keep your workers, you need to treat them well. (For
information on workers’ legal rights, see Chapter 9.) Here are some areas of
consideration:
 Wages: The going wage varies by area. The local labor bureau can often
tell you the local average wage for various functions. Some FIEs make it
a policy to pay a few hundred RMB per month more than the average
wage. (See Chapter 9 for info on wages and benefits.)
 Housing: If you have workers from other provinces, you may have to
house them in a dormitory. Many FIEs that are known for treating their
employees well put no more than four workers in one dorm room. They
also provide each dorm room with a private bathroom. Some factories
reduce the pay of workers who live on site in order to cover the housing
costs.
 Employee appreciation: Show workers that you care. You can do so in
easy ways. For example, when the weather’s really hot, you can bring a
bunch of sodas and popsicles down to the factory floor to share with the
workers.
 Professional development: In general, factory workers want the same
things that office workers do: They’re hungry to learn and develop.
When they go to work in your factory, they expect you to empower them
and train them in your culture and technology. Hold up your end of the
bargain! Give them clear paths to advancement and give them the sense
that they can grow with your company.
However, make sure your workers don’t have it both ways. If they want
to be paid and empowered, then they have to take on more responsibil-
ity. Make your workers maintain their own machines and sweep the
floors around them as well as handle other tasks.
Many customers insist on inspecting their suppliers’ facilities from time to
time. Also, a lot of multinationals insist on privately interviewing their suppli-
ers’ workers to ask them about working conditions. First and foremost, cus-
tomers (especially multinationals) want to avoid damage to their reputations
from buying from sweatshops. They also know that worker unhappiness can
248
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

translate into production problems. If your company doesn’t treat its workers
well, your clients may find out and go elsewhere!
If your worker turnover hits 20 percent, assume something’s wrong at the fac-
tory. At that point, you should be closely evaluating your managers to see
whether they’re causing the problem.
Hiring Quality Control
One of the big issues that Western manufacturers moving into China face is
quality control. Because of the skills gap of many Chinese workers, expecting
each factory worker to do his or her own QC is almost always unrealistic.
One reason for the skills gap is that unskilled factory workers don’t have
much mechanical aptitude. Also, they don’t buy and use the products them-
selves. Because they’re not also consumers (as Western factory workers are),
they generally don’t understand the products that well. Because of the legacy
of China’s previous Soviet-style manufacturing culture, which paid no heed to
quality, getting Chinese workers to fully buy into and understand quality may
take decades.
Most factories hire workers who are dedicated solely to doing QC. QC work-
ers usually have the same limitations that production workers have. There-
fore, you should have a given QC worker perform only one type of test. For
example, you can have one worker be responsible for measuring dimensions
and another worker responsible for ensuring that a component lights up. The
breakdown obviously depends on what you’re making; however, your QC
people likely won’t be able to understand the whole picture well. Therefore,
make QC as simple as possible for each worker.
To make your QC efforts as effective as possible, pay close attention to how
you provide incentives and disincentives for your factory workers. Docking a
worker’s pay for individual mistakes isn’t a good idea. In a society that values
harmony, QC people and other factory workers are unlikely to point out mis-
takes that’ll cost individual coworkers. Moreover, workers can pressure QC
people to underreport defects if the defects will cost the workers.
Tie a portion of everyone’s compensation to overall quality. If defects are
found before shipment to the customer, the penalties should be very light.
On the other hand, if the customer returns products because of defects, you
should set fairly strict penalties. Spread the penalties across all workers
involved in making those products. Use common sense, though — if the 
issue is with poor-quality inputs, penalize purchasing and QC rather than 
the workers.
249
Chapter 13: Manufacturing in China

You should usually do thorough QC on inputs. You’re likely going to face
more quality issues with your suppliers in China than you would in the West.
And because of your less-skilled Chinese workforce, you’re probably going to
need better inputs than you would in the West. For more on working with
suppliers in China, see Chapter 12.
Some customers may actually want to review data from your QC processes.
Make sure you work closely with your customers to understand what kinds of
data they want to see.
The more QC, the better! Test quality throughout the entire process — from
deliveries to finished products. For an in-depth discussion of QC techniques
you may be able to apply, check out Quality Control For Dummies (Wiley).

Selling in China
In This Chapter
 Knowing Chinese consumers
 Getting distribution right
 Advertising in China
 Figuring out how and when to enter the market
 Selling to customers and other companies
S
elling in China is the prize everybody seems to set their eyes on. According
to some estimates, China has over 320,000 millionaires (that’s in U.S. dol-
lars!), and the number is growing rapidly. Below that tier, China’s middle class
exceeds 75 million people and is also growing at breakneck pace. Best of all,
the Chinese are still figuring out how to spend their newfound money.
In this chapter, we discuss selling. Most of the chapter deals with the Chinese
consumer, which is unique in the world. You have to work hard to earn their
disposable income, but if you get the formula right, the effort’s well worth 
it. We also discuss selling to businesses briefly here (and in Chapter 13, on
manufacturing).
Appealing to the Chinese Consumer
In general, foreign companies selling in China win customers by offering three
things:
 Technology
 Superior quality
 A higher-end image
Historically, Chinese consumers were worried about only one thing: price.
They never asked “where’s the beef?” as long as the price was low enough.
The Chinese are now becoming more sophisticated consumers, although
commanding a premium can be tough for your product or service if you
aren’t selling to high-end customers.

You’re going to have a very hard time competing on price with Chinese com-
panies, but one of the positives about the Chinese market is that high-end
consumers are very willing to try new things. However, don’t assume that if
you market it, they will come. In order to maintain consistent appeal to
Chinese consumers, you have to make a number of adjustments, which we
discuss in the following sections.
Knowing your customer
“Know thy customer” is one of the first rules of marketing. The following sec-
tions can help you figure out just who may be interested in your product or
service and how they’ll react to your offering.
Viewing a portrait of the Chinese consumer class
Unlike in the West, most of the money in China belongs to people who are
younger than 45. Because of the cultural revolution (see Chapter 3), people
older than that generally aren’t well educated, live in government subsidized
housing, and have spent the bulk of their careers in state-owned enterprises
(SOEs). The younger generation is better educated and is more likely to work
in private firms, including foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs — see Chapter 7).
Regionally, China’s middle and wealthy classes tend to cluster in Beijing, the
Pearl River delta, and the Yangtze River corridor.
Understanding different markets, different consumers
Chinese consumers show important regional differences in their buying
habits. You may very well need different approaches in different regions.
Many factors determine how people will react to your offering, but here are
some tendencies that may hold true:
 Northern Chinese aren’t quite as price sensitive as other Chinese. They’re
more likely to pay for convenience instead of shopping around to com-
pare prices.
 Chinese people in the central coastal areas tend to shop around a lot
and try to play stores off one another for a better price. They usually go
for the best deal.
 Southern Chinese (particularly Guangdong province) are used to getting
good products at low prices. They’ve had access to factory overruns at
deep discounts for many years.
You also have to be aware of lifestyle differences among consumers, so do a
lot of research on your particular targets in each market you want to sell into.
Shanghai, for instance, is generally more avant garde and Western-friendly
than Beijing. But contrary to what you may think based on the two cities’ rep-
utations, young Shanghainese tend to be closer to their parents and lead
252
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

more stable lifestyles. Beijing’s 18- to 35-year-olds are more attuned to the
rest of the world — particularly in pop culture — than are the youth in
Shanghai or any other Chinese city. Beijing’s youth are also less traditional
than in any other part of China, which may explain why Beijing is the center
of China’s rock and pop scenes.
Getting a leg up by researching your target consumer
China is a series of regional markets and submarkets. Dig deep to really under-
stand your targets — you may end up revising many of your initial assumptions.
In China, you’d do consumer research the same as you’d do it in the West.
The positive for foreign companies is that most Chinese companies don’t
bother (or don’t know how) to do consumer research. For Chinese compa-
nies, just throwing ideas on the shelves and seeing whether they sell is usu-
ally cheaper and faster. If you’re going to compete with Chinese offerings,
market research can give you an edge.
In China, doing intercept interviews is usually more effective than doing focus
groups (when the Chinese do focus groups, they tend to be a little embar-
rassed about speaking in front of each other). Hiring interviewers isn’t that
expensive.
Helping customers show their “face”
The Chinese are inherently suspicious of anything that costs more than aver-
age. One way to overcome their aversion to paying higher prices is to sell
them a product or service that gives them face, or status in the eyes of others
(see Chapter 11 for details on face).
For a product to give face, others must be able to see the consumer with it.
For example, a car has the potential to give face; a blender usually doesn’t.
A lot of face relates to branding, which we discuss next. In general, if some-
thing is perceived as newer, cooler, fresher, more lavish, and so on, it gives
the consumer face. Face is a powerful argument in favor of paying more for a
product or service; conversely, an expensive offering that doesn’t give much
face is a tougher sell.
Looking at name recognition: 
The Chinese and branding
China doesn’t have a tradition of strong brands, though the Chinese are start-
ing to become conscious of brand identity. As one foreign sales executive
says, high-end Chinese consumers pay for “perceived image.”
253
Chapter 14: Selling in China

Building brand loyalty
Building brand loyalty is hard in China, and it takes more than making a cus-
tomer happy with your product. The flipside of new and cool is that some-
body else’s offering is soon going to be newer and cooler than yours. As a
result, China is probably the most rapidly changing consumer market in the
world. You may have to make constant adjustments to your offering just to
create the perception that you’re leading the market in innovation.
Changing your offering constantly can be very expensive. What you really
need to create is the perception of change, which doesn’t always require
costly changes to the substance of product or service.
Another way companies can create brand loyalty in China is by associating
with celebrities. In the past, China didn’t have many of its own celebrities, so
companies were limited to using foreign personalities. Although celebrity cul-
ture is still developing in China, the nation already boasts a number of bona
fide Chinese celebrities. Chinese celebrity culture isn’t built solely around
entertainers or athletes — it also centers on successful businesspeople!
Word-of-mouth campaigns supported by company incentives are also effec-
tive at creating brand loyalty in China. To encourage personal recommenda-
tions, you can offer a customer a discount on the next purchase if he or she
refers a friend.
254
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 
Where price matters: Cayennes and yams
A single consumer may be willing to pay for
image with one type of product but be incredibly
price-sensitive with another. One foreign busi-
nessman tells the story of the time he was walk-
ing along the sidewalk in Shanghai discussing
cars with a wealthy Chinese businesswoman.
The woman said that she planned to purchase a
Porsche Cayenne — a car that sells for over
US$100,000 in China — in the near future. When
the foreigner asked her why the Cayenne, she
replied, “Because it’s a good car.”
The woman stopped to buy some yams from a
street vendor, but when the vendor told her that
the price for two yams was 8 RMB (US$1), the
woman became furious. She proceeded to
shout at the vendor that she never pays more
than 6 RMB for two yams.
The woman and the vendor began to argue
loudly over the price. After 15 minutes of shout-
ing and negotiating, the future Porsche buyer
walked away with two yams. She was quite
pleased with herself for having won the argu-
ment over 2 RMB (US$0.25).

Most companies operating in China are making at best rudimentary use of
databasing techniques to build brand loyalty. Building databases of cus-
tomers offers an opportunity to develop a relationship with them. Foreign
baby-product marketers in particular use databases well, often keeping
records of parents’ and babies’ names and babies’ ages. Then they market to
the parents throughout the children’s developmental stages.
Considering nationalism
Until the past few years, Chinese almost always associated foreign products
with superior quality. They’re not necessarily thinking that way anymore, and
they’re sometimes willing to forego quality in order to help the domestic
company compete against the big, bad foreign competition. The growing “buy
China” sentiment among Chinese consumers will continue to be a difficult
tightrope for foreign companies to walk in China, possibly reminiscent of
what Japanese auto manufacturers faced in the U.S. in the 1980s.
One strategy for foreign companies is to buy Chinese brands and allow them
to keep their Chinese identity. At the same time, you can improve operations
through foreign processes and management.
One company that has done extremely well investing in Chinese brands is
Groupe Danone SA. Since 1991, Danone has been acquiring stakes in a number
of Chinese brands, which very few consumers realize. In fact, one of Danone’s
investments is Feichang Cola, which goes head-to-head against Coke and
Pepsi by trumpeting itself as “China’s own cola.”
255
Chapter 14: Selling in China
Talkin’ to celebrities for endorsements
You don’t have to be a massive multinational
corporation to land an effective celebrity. For
instance, take Talk da Talk, a Shanghai-based
company providing activity-based English train-
ing to young Chinese professionals (www.talk
datalk.com). A few young entrepreneurs
started the company in 2003. Cofounders Jim
Leu and Rich Chin saw the potential to develop
strong brand identity by working with a
celebrity, so they approached David Wu, a pop-
ular TV personality in China. Wu was intrigued
by the idea and agreed to work with the group.
He became a significant equity holder in the
company and is heavily featured in all aspects
of its advertising, marketing, and branding.
Despite beginning with a relatively modest invest-
ment, Talk da Talk has managed to create a
strong awareness in its markets through the part-
nership with Wu. There is a flipside though —
most new customers think of Talk da Talk as
David Wu’s company! Talk da Talk encourages
this association, but it may not work for everyone.

Getting Ready to Deliver: 
It’s All about Distribution!
Distribution is the hardest part of selling products in China. It’s regional and
highly fragmented, and you have to deal with a wide range of channels and
multiple layers. The products that win in China aren’t necessarily the best
ones; they’re the products that get to where they need to be.
Where your products get sold
The retail market in China has been a little bipolar — the formats that have
been doing well are either large hypermarkets or tiny neighborhood stores.
Although all segments are growing, specialty retail is really taking off now.
Hypermarkets in hyperdrive
Hypermarkets, such as Carrefour, Wal-Mart, Century Mart, and WuMart, are
the largest force in retail in China. Because of their large size, they aren’t that
convenient to get to; thus, they’re destinations. These stores offer better
assortment and lower prices because they eliminate a number of distribution
layers by functioning as warehouses that take deliveries directly from the
port or factories. Hypermarkets often provide a mixture of well-known inter-
national and Chinese-branded products.

In the cards: Turning low-tech communication 
into high-tech databases
Although China may not offer you all the data-
basing techniques you’d have in the West, you
can come up with innovative ways to keep track
of your customers. Consider the China Infor-
mation Broadcast Network (CIBN), which deliv-
ers value-added Internet services and digital
entertainment via mobile phones under its CATV
brand. Because China doesn’t have the devel-
oped credit and debit card system of Western
countries, the use of prepaid cards for services
(particularly Internet-based) is common. CIBN
takes this relatively low-tech reality and does
some sophisticated high-tech databasing with it:
The company has created a prepaid card that
allows CIBN to track and understand its 
customers, cross-sell goods, and develop new
products.

Hypermarkets’ Chinese suppliers are usually much smaller than their multi-
national suppliers. The Chinese brands in hypermarkets are ones that
Chinese in the local markets are familiar with. Often, these products have
special features (such as a particular taste) that make them popular in a par-
ticular locale. The Chinese-branded goods are usually commodities, such as
sugar and tea, but they’re differentiated in some way from their competition.
The Chinese goods in these stores come from the relatively small number of
Chinese manufacturers that are able to meet the hypermarkets’ quality and
distribution standards.
Tough-to-beat convenience
After hypermarkets, the second-largest number of retail sales occurs in con-
venience or neighborhood grocery stores. These stores are often individually
owned and independent, but you do see some large chains, such as Lian Hua,
Lawsons, Ke Di, All Days, and 7-11, which are usually franchises. The mom-
and-pop stores are quite cramped, but they generate business because
they’re located close to their customers.

Spreading the word on distribution costs
Distribution expenses in China are among the
highest in the world. China’s logistics spending
accounts for 17.6 percent of the GDP, as com-
pared to 11.2 percent and 8.5 percent in Europe
and the U.S., respectively.
The following chart illustrates the complexity
and expense of distribution in China. The
markup at each level refers to the markup over
the price at which the distributor buys the prod-
uct. By the time the product gets to the con-
sumer, distribution markups have added about
36 percent to the cost of premium detergent:
100% × 102% × 106% × 105% × 120% ≈136%

Specialty stores
Specialty retail, or focusing on a particular offering or type of offering to the
consumer, is a great opportunity for smaller foreign companies — both as a
distribution channel and as a business model. Specialty retail is growing par-
ticularly quickly because of the increasing incomes of Chinese and because
Chinese consumers are looking for alternatives to hypermarkets and depart-
ment stores.
Three distribution choices
You can distribute products in China in three ways:
 Using third-party distributors
 Partnering with or acquiring a Chinese firm
 Growing your own sales force
You have to be pretty sure you’ll be able to sell enough volume to cover the
fixed costs of your distribution network, so some companies use the first two
techniques until they can establish their own sales force. The following sec-
tions go over some of your options.
Hiring third-party distributors
Third-party distribution in China is more expensive than in the West. Unfor-
tunately, this extra expense doesn’t usually buy you good service. Most dis-
tributors do little more than transport goods. They’re often lackluster at
selling your product because they don’t understand it and don’t care that
much. They usually don’t manage inventory, track shipments, stock prod-
ucts, or merchandise.
Unfortunately, when you ask distributors whether they can do more than just
bring products from A to B, they’ll yes you to death. Although you can find a
few good distributors in China, don’t believe most third-party distributors.
Even though the third-party distribution picture isn’t pretty, using third par-
ties during your first few years selling in China may be a good idea if you
want to get off the ground quickly. This strategy is usually best when you’re
not selling a potentially big mass-market product (for mass-market products,
try to have your own sales force from the beginning — see the upcoming
“Developing a homegrown sales force” section).
If you do use third parties during these first few years, you can work on
developing your own sales force at the same time. When evaluating a distrib-
utor, ask it to provide foreign-company customer references. Here’s a list of
things to think about when dealing with a distributor:
258
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

 Make sure it’s not selling your competitors’ products without telling you.
 Ensure that it knows your industry, has experience in your product area,
and knows who your customers are.
 Speak with your customers (or potential customers) to determine
whether they respect and trust the distributor.
 Payment and collection involve a whole new set of risks, so make sure
any distributor who handles that area of your business is up to the job.
 Find out whether the distributor buys from you in advance or just takes
orders from your customer and has you fulfill them.
 Find out whether it uses modern technology to provide its services.
Don’t agree to grant exclusive distributorships — it’s neither necessary nor
usual in China.
Partnering with/acquiring a Chinese firm for its distribution
Acquiring a Chinese firm for its distribution can make sense depending on
the numbers. Basically, partnering is for companies that want to make
smaller financial commitments to China. The idea behind partnering with a
Chinese firm is that it already has a good sales force and distribution. This
method is very much a plunge into China, because you’re going to have to
integrate and run your Chinese company. In a best-case scenario, the brands
you acquire can maintain their Chinese identities (see “Considering National-
ism,” earlier in this chapter). At the same time, you can successfully piggy-
back your foreign brands on the acquired company’s distribution network
and improve overall management practices at the company.
This model can work, but it’s seldom perfect. The problem is that the partner
will almost always sell its own products before yours, regardless of whatever

Sims: Spotlight on exceptional distribution
Effective distribution companies do exist in
China. They offer quality market analyses, effec-
tive sales, IT support and management, and
logistics services. Elizabeth Harrington, CEO of
E. Harrington Global, has over 25 years of expe-
rience in China business. One of Harrington’s
clients, Sims Hong Kong (www.simshk.com),
is among the few Western-style distribution
companies in China.
When Harrington helped Sims develop its China
strategy, the company was a division of an
Asian retail giant. In 2001, Sims was acquired by
CITIC Pacific, the Hong Kong–listed arm of
CITIC (China Investment and Trust Investment
Company), which is a powerful investment arm
of the Chinese government. The sale strength-
ened Sims’ capabilities in China. Sims’ prior
ownership gives it understanding of retail mar-
keting, and the transaction with CITIC Pacific
provides it with market access. Sims is one of
the few firms that offers a full range of services
for its national distribution network.

assurances the company reps give you, even in a joint venture. You’ll prob-
ably have to accept that you’re a second-class citizen. Also, your partner
owns the customers, so if your deal goes south, you’re back at square one as
far as finding customers goes.
Developing a homegrown sales force
If your company is willing to commit the resources, developing your own
sales force is likely the best distribution solution. In doing so, you can take an
aggressive approach and look to build a large force overnight. Or you can do
it the Chinese way by building gradually and letting your existing sales force’s
productivity pay for expansion; we talk about this method more in the
upcoming “Deciding How You Want to Enter the Market” section.
The right people
Your initial sales hires ideally have sales experience and know your industry.
Of course, you’re in even better shape if they have relationships with cus-
tomers. If you’re going to grow the Chinese way, take the time to find this
type of salesperson.
If your candidates lack experience, look for people who are eager to receive
international standard training. They should also be motivated to advance,
gaining responsibility and greater face, and to earn a lot of money.
Fact-based selling
The traditional Chinese mentality has been to drive sales based on making
their product prices cheap. They look to profit based on high volume.
However, most Western sellers aren’t coming to China to battle it out for
razor-thin margins.
The Chinese also have a tradition of relationship-based selling in which sales-
people look to develop friendships with customers. After they’ve done that,
their friends buy whatever they’re selling, provided that it’s cheap enough.
As a foreign company with a quality offering, you’re going to have to train
your salespeople to sell based on a new set of criteria.
You must train your salespeople to make the case that your product or ser-
vice sells at a premium because of the number and/or quality of its features.
The salespeople also have to be able to make factual comparisons between
your product and the competitions’. Try your best to ensure that they under-
stand and believe in your brand. Perhaps loan them the product so they can
try it out themselves.
If you’re selling very high-end goods, take fact-based selling a step further.
Your salespeople have to be able to read customers and sell to them based
on what the customers want. This skill is part natural ability, part training.
260
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

Training and management
Have two people train each new sales hire. In this model, one trainer is a
solid senior salesperson and the other is a fairly new salesperson. The new
hire learns from a seasoned employee while the less-experienced salesperson
reinforces his or her own training by teaching and gains confidence and face.
Sometimes, having someone who’s just a little ahead of them in training is
valuable for new hires when they need to ask for advice — the old hands may
have forgotten what starting out is like.
As for promotions, not all salespeople make good managers. Figuring out
whether someone is management material usually takes a few years. Don’t
promote salespeople to management if they’re not suited for it.
Failing to promote employees may cause them to lose face, so you may want
to set up a two-tier track for senior salespeople — one into management and
the other into a prestigious sales title. When promoting salespeople into the
latter, take them aside and convince them that they don’t want to be man-
agers — after all, they can make more money and have fewer headaches if
they stay in sales! Maybe give them a bigger desk or some other perks that
show they’re not just average salespeople.
At the end of the day, it’s about pay
The key to getting your sales force to sell is proper incentives. Your pay
system must motivate people to sell. However, here are a few things to watch
out for:
 Pay for profitability. Don’t provide incentives for your salespeople to dis-
count products deeply in order to get volume.
 Pay salespeople only after delivery and customer payment. If you pay
them just when they get the order, you’re likely to have a lot of fake
orders.
 Watch out for your salespeople’s paying kickbacks. Don’t let them get
your company into trouble by marking up prices to give money to some-
one on the other end. (For more on financial controls, see Chapter 17.)
Trench warfare in distribution
One Western sales executive calls distributing in China “trench warfare.”
China has significantly more retail outlets than the U.S., even though the
retail market is a fraction of the size. Part of the reason for the fragmentation
is that the government encourages it. Retail in China is a large employer,
which the government likes. Therefore, you’re likely going to need to have a
261
Chapter 14: Selling in China

lot of salespeople spending significant time face-to-face with the store
owners. Competition for shelf space is ugly, and success requires persistence
and systemization.
If you want to reach the mass market, you have to deal with a lot of mom-and-
pop stores and the hypermarkets (see the earlier section titled “Where your
products get sold”). If you’re selling to both ends of the spectrum, the vary-
ing approaches take a good deal of sophistication.
Dealing with mom-and-pop stores
Selling to mom-and-pop stores takes incredibly detailed process manage-
ment. Your salespeople have to constantly be at the stores, keeping good
relationships with the store-level people. And after your salespeople leave
the store, another salesperson is likely to come along and replace your prod-
uct on the shelf with his or her own. Therefore, your people have to keep
returning and putting your product back on the shelf.
Here are ways to make your product more appealing and to build relation-
ships when dealing with mom-and-pops:
 Make sure you give them smaller packaging. These stores are often
cramped.
 In addition to having good relationships with the store operators, your
salespeople have to use those fact-based selling skills to convince the
stores that they can sell your product for more money and make a
higher profit margin. (See the earlier section on fact-based selling.)
 Make sure your salespeople work closely with mom and pop to give
them a good display and technical support.
At the small store level, you may see a good deal of corruption. Operators
may want kickbacks to stock your merchandise. For a whole host of reasons,
your salespeople shouldn’t play along. If they do, it’s a vicious cycle — the
required payments will get larger and larger. Eventually, you’ll have no profit
margin. Also, when dealing with small Chinese stores, don’t extend credit —
you won’t get paid.
Running with the big dogs in hypermarkets
Smaller foreign companies’ product prices are usually sandwiched between
those of local brands and well-known multinationals. Even though smaller
companies’ products may cost less than other multinationals’, they don’t have
the brand recognition. Unless your product is widely known or has no real
Chinese competition, hypermarkets are a tough channel for a small company.
The hypermarkets look for suppliers that can provide consistent quality 
on time. If you’re a smaller company, you can get into the hypermarkets 
by explaining why they need to carry your product. Show that there’s an
262
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

unfulfilled demand in their China stores for your product, and they’ll often be
willing to buy from you on a test basis to fill that hole.
Chain convenience and grocery stores usually have centralized purchasing
that has to approve your company as a vendor. Franchisees then have some
discretion in what they stock, so they may choose to pick up your product.
Advertising
Chinese consumers are usually receptive to advertising (if done right).
However, reaching them through TV and other mass media can be very
costly. Fortunately, China offers a number of effective but less expensive
advertising alternatives. The following sections tell you how to arrange effec-
tive advertising.
Keeping the message simple and obvious
The nice thing for foreign companies advertising in China is that Chinese aren’t
as cynical about ads as Westerners are. Advertising in China seems to reflect an
age of innocence similar to the post-WWII U.S. There’s little subtlety in convey-
ing the message in advertising in China. Make the message simple and obvious.
Catering to aspirations of wealth
Effective advertising in China often caters to aspirations of obtaining a
wealthy, luxurious lifestyle (frequently in a nouveau riche sense) — even for
mass-market products. Chinese consumers associate a wealthy lifestyle with
images of modern home interiors decorated with designer furniture (often in
various shades of white), accessorized with grand pianos and gilded objects.
Advertisements promoting premium products tend to be somewhat over-the-
top. Cheryl Chong, a former advertising professional with J. Walter Thompson
in Beijing, tells the story of a high-profile campaign she once produced as
marketing director for a mobile phone company in China. One commercial
featured two top fashion models: One picking up a Van Gogh painting at an
art gallery while the other drove away in a flaming red Ferrari.
A commercial for an imported alcoholic spirit features two Chinese men in
their 40s arriving at a European castle built on an island in a lake. One man
arrives by helicopter, the other comes by limousine. The two step out of their
respective modes of transportation and solemnly nod to each other. Each
man takes his turn handling a bow and shooting an arrow at a remote target
in the middle of the lake. After each hits the bull’s-eye with his first shot,
their menservants pour them glasses of the spirit. The commercial closes
with the two archers raising their glasses in a tribute to each other.
263
Chapter 14: Selling in China

Choosing advertising features
Here are some points to remember as you try to appeal to your audience:
 Chinese consumers generally respond better than Westerners to adver-
tising featuring cutesy kids.
 Celebrity marketing is effective in China (see the earlier section on
Chinese and branding).
 Sports and music marketing do all right, but they don’t generate as
much traction as in the West. They’re starting to become more effective
as Chinese sports and pop culture gathers steam.
Minding the rules: Good kids and Confucians
Don’t advertise in a way that conflicts with traditional Chinese values. Gener-
ally avoid messages of children disobeying their parents (usually a cardinal
sin in Confucian societies) or that stress individualism (although this method
can be effective in some ads aimed at youth).
Watch out for some legal no-no’s in advertising in China. Advertisers can’t
show a woman wearing anything that suggests that she isn’t wearing a bra.
They can’t show images of the Chinese flag. And claiming that your product
is “the best” or making comparisons to the competition is also impermissible.
Getting the message out
You can reach consumers where they live or work or get consumers to come
to you. This section explains your options.
Mass media
Traditional mass media in China is similar to that of anywhere else: televi-
sion, radio, newspapers, and magazines. To gain traction in mass markets,
you either have to have a large share of the advertising voice — in other
words, advertise very frequently relative to the competition — or your adver-
tising has to clearly differentiate your offering.
The problem is that TV advertising is fragmented and expensive. The only
network with nationwide coverage is China Central Television (CCTV), which
has 12 channels. Prime-time spots on CCTV go through a highly competitive
annual bidding process. If your company wants these, it’ll have to go up
against the likes of Procter & Gamble, which spends over $3 billion in mass
media advertising in China per year. Your other choice is to deal with a patch-
work of more than 300 TV networks with over 3,000 stations nationwide.
Newspapers and magazines are similarly fragmented and expensive unless an
advertiser has a large scale.
264
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

Out-of-home advertising
For companies that don’t have huge advertising budgets, China is generally
ahead of the West for out-of-home advertising opportunities. The best part of
out-of-home advertising is that it allows your company to target markets in a
cost-effective manner and to reach specific segments of consumers. In addi-
tion to billboards, Chinese cities frequently offer video advertising in taxi-
cabs, trains, and elevators. With a captive audience of commuters, these
forms of advertising can be pretty effective.
China is also well ahead of the West in another form of out-of-home advertis-
ing: SMS (text messages sent to mobile phones). With 450 million mobile phone
users, this media platform allows advertisers to send highly-customized mes-
sages to the urban communities in each city. eDongcity (www.2288.com),
which Cheryl Chong founded, was one of the first providers of SMS content
marketing in China, and it continues to be one of the largest.
Another widely used form of out-of-home advertising is event marketing. For
instance, high-end brands often hold launch parties. Event marketing and
management companies maintain databases of high-end consumers in vari-
ous markets that you can use to build your guest list.
A similar concept is called roadshow, which is essentially a series of smaller-
scale events conducted at high-traffic venues such as shopping mall atriums,
public parks, and campus hubs. Roadshows are effective for advertisers who
require a live audience to perform product demonstrations.
Deciding How You Want 
to Enter the Market
You have to move quickly to keep up with China’s consumer markets, but
don’t be sloppy. We discuss a few schools of thought on how to enter the
market. Think about which approach is likely to work best for you.
One absolute is to have your distribution network solidly in place before
trying to sell. If you don’t have your network set up well before you start to
sell, your chances of failure are pretty high. So first dig your trenches and get
your (or a distribution company’s) soldiers in them. In other words, first
determine where you’re going to need to deploy your salespeople. Then
figure out a system for organizing and scheduling their frequent customer
visits. Finally, make sure they’re well trained and up for the job.
Building and scaling distribution in third-tier (and sometimes second-tier)
cities is easier. See Chapter 7 for more info on location.
265
Chapter 14: Selling in China

Guns blazing
One approach for entering the Chinese consumer market is to target several
markets right off the bat, putting all your energy behind the campaign. The
rationale is that competition is going to move in like lightning on your cus-
tomer base, so you need to establish your presence in your target markets
immediately. If you’ve set up a solid distribution network in your markets
before launching, you’re halfway there.
If you use this approach, you need to think about how you can make poten-
tial mistakes as cheap as possible for you. After all, if you make some incor-
rect assumptions, you may screw up in several markets rather than just one.
When you make mistakes on a large scale, they cost a lot more money.
Immediately targeting multiple markets will kill you if you’re doing only small
volumes in each market because you won’t have the revenue to support high
overhead costs related to your scale.
Starting with a beachhead
Many companies initially focus on one market, prove the model, and then
expand to other markets. The Chinese are always impressed by a person or
company that’s number one in some aspect, so touting your reputation as
being the leader in market A can help you sell in market B. Using this model
limits your risk in terms of markets and capital. The smaller scale also makes
tweaking the model easier. When you use this technique, establishing your
distribution first is still critical.

Putting down roots: Cinkate growin’ great
Cinkate, a pharmaceutical manufacturing and
sales company in China, is an excellent exam-
ple of the pay-as-you-go model. Cinkate (www.
cinkate.com) was founded in 1994 by Dr.
James Williams, a leading U.S. surgeon, and Dr.
Xiao Fei, a Chinese-born surgeon who trained
with Williams.
Williams and Xiao saw the opportunity to man-
ufacture high-quality patented medicines in
China at lower costs and sell them into the
Chinese market. They started the company with
their own funds. Cinkate found a contract man-
ufacturer and then developed its own sales
force. Initially, the company focused on only one
therapeutic area and two products. As the busi-
ness developed, they reinvested the profits to
fund growth into new products and markets.
Over the past 12 years, the company has
become one of the leading pharmaceutical
sales companies in China. It’s highly profitable
and debt free.

China has very few national brands, so you can take the view that any compe-
tition in other markets won’t be too strong for you to knock off when you
arrive. Foreign competition, though, may be a different story.
The decision as to how quickly you expand is similar to the initial decision to
begin with a beachhead rather than going in with guns blazing. The Chinese
way, a pay-as-you-go system, may or may not be right for your business. This
method means using the profits from the first market to get a little larger,
then using those profits to get a little bit larger, and so forth.
The chief drawback of moving slowly is that your competition can leapfrog
ahead of you. China is one of the most competitive, cutthroat markets in the
world. Before going slowly, take stock of your company’s competitive advan-
tages. Ask whether they’re ample to allow you to scale gradually.
Letting others blaze the trails for you
Just as in the West, you may be more comfortable moving into China on the
coattails of one of your competitors. With this method, you let your competition
develop awareness and demand for what you plan to offer. The competition also
educates the government on your business. You sit back and study their mis-
takes. Finally, you go into China. You may want to go head-to-head in big mar-
kets where your competition has established itself, or you may figure that China
is a big enough pie that you can each have your own slices without clashing.
For instance, U.S. do-it-yourself (DIY) home remodeling chain Home Depot
was content to let its competition get to China first. In 1999, B&Q (owned by
U.K.-based Kingfisher) became the first large foreign DIY store to arrive in
China. B&Q quickly learned a lot of lessons about China, such as not putting
higher-priced items in the front of the store (these intimidated customers
into not entering) and having plenty of product samples within easy reach for
customers to play with.
Not until December 2006 did Home Depot finally take the plunge into China.
Home Depot announced that it would enter China by acquiring Chinese DIY
retailer, Home Way. At this point, B&Q had over 50 stores in China. Home Depot
appears to be betting that it can learn from B&Q’s earlier mistakes. Most
interestingly, Home Depot’s strategy seems to be to buy those competitors that
inevitably spring up when a company begins to develop a new market in China.
Don’t be the eighth mover. If the market is saturated, you’re likely better off
not moving on it.
267
Chapter 14: Selling in China

Selling to Consumers
You can sell to consumers in China in a number of ways. Consumers are get-
ting more sophisticated, and they’re looking for more than just hypermarkets
and convenience stores.
Retail stores
If you’re going to set up retail stores in China, you should expect that Chinese
shoppers are as sophisticated as customers anywhere else in the world.
Therefore, you should bring your latest store concept to China.
Don’t fall into the trap of making assumptions based on cheap labor. If you
think margins will be higher in China, think again. High rent eats up a lot of
cost savings. Also, don’t rely on cheap labor instead of using sophisticated
inventory tracking systems. This tracking is particularly important in China,
where you may encounter supply bottlenecks.
The following sections discuss a bit about your retail options.
Making concessions: Renting space from department stores
One retail option in China is the department store concession. Unlike in the
West, Chinese department stores usually don’t buy inventory themselves.
Instead, they rent out parts of their store to individual retailers. In most
cases, concessionaires rent out a concession to sell just one brand. The
result is confusing to many Western consumers because in Chinese depart-
ment stores, products are usually grouped by brand rather than by type. This
setup makes complete sense to the Chinese, though.
One drawback to renting a department store concession is that you have 
to float the department store 30 to 45 days on your sales. The department
stores you rent from (rather than the concessions) provide the points of sale.
Therefore, sorting out your sales and paying you takes the store some time.
Selling items in your own store
As we mention earlier in this chapter, specialty retailing is a particularly
attractive opportunity for smaller foreign companies. You can choose from
lots of possibilities, but some of the areas that seem particularly promising
are stores related to cars (for example, car washes and lube shops), budget
hotels, and education-related businesses.
One of the tough parts of retailing in China is that landlords customarily
reserve the right to move you out — even though you sign a lease for a cer-
tain number of years. What’s worse is that landlords sometimes move you
out and then try to ride your coattails by opening a similar business in your
place. This problem is just one of the realities of retailing in China.
268
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

Even though consumers show little brand loyalty in China, the concession
system (see the preceding section) has made Chinese consumers used to
shopping in stores by brand rather than by type of product. As some Western
retailers have found out, getting consumers to break this habit — even in
small stores — is difficult. Therefore, you probably want to set your store up
the same way, grouping items by brand, not by product type.
Franchising
Franchising is a very hot area for foreign businesses in China. It’s a new con-
cept to Chinese. Many foreign retailers that don’t normally franchise are
choosing to do so in China. By having a Chinese person operating a store,
you may be able to avoid making mistakes due to your lack of knowledge or
understanding of the market. Franchising may be the best way for your com-
pany to enter second- and third-tier markets if your company isn’t commit-
ting enormous resources to China.
On the other hand, you want to ensure that your franchisees stick to your
system. Franchisees may attempt to change important aspects of the store
because they feel they have better ways of doing things. However, when fran-
chisees make those changes, they can hurt your company a lot more by dam-
aging the brand.
269
Chapter 14: Selling in China
Keeping the customer’s experience consistent
One of the problems of managing employees in
any industry in China is that they sometimes
think they’ve found a better way to do some-
thing than what you’ve taught then. Without
telling you, they may start doing it their way
instead. When you’re in retail, this can be par-
ticularly problematic.
Rick Wang is CEO of RetailCo, Inc. (www.retail
coinc.com), which is a company that spe-
cializes in apparel and food and beverage retail-
ing. He says that in China, “Training is easy;
training for consistency is hard.” His favorite
example of this is a story one of his associates
told him about training Chinese restaurant staff
in a five-star hotel. The trainer spent several
weeks each in Shanghai, showing the restau-
rant staff (among other things) how to set a
Western-style table — forks, knives, spoons,
and all. The staff learned quickly. After a few
weeks of reinforcement, they were setting the
tables perfectly each time.
The trainer then left China for a couple of
months. When he returned to the hotel, he saw
that the tables were set perfectly — except for
one thing. The spoons were all placed above
the plates. He called the wait staff over and
asked why they were doing this. They said,
“Your system is good, but don’t you think ours is
better?” The moral of this story is that to keep
things consistent and maintain your brand and
quality, train your employees. Don’t assume that
they absorbed it the first time. Train them again.
And again.

Finding applicants
If you’re thinking of franchising your brand in China, you can find plenty of
people in China who have the money and desire to become franchisees.
However, because China doesn’t have any credit bureaus, finding quality fran-
chisees takes a lot of work. For example, when RetailCo recently sought out
franchisees for a new footwear store concept, it received about 500 business
cards at a single franchise fair. Some people even approached the company
with bundles of cash. Through a gradual process of screening and interview-
ing, RetailCo narrowed the field from that event to just one franchisee —
that’s right, just one.
You can get the word out that you’re offering franchise opportunities in a
number of ways, including Franchise China (www.english.franchise
china.com) and other shows, franchise brokers, and franchising consul-
tants. The key to selling franchises isn’t having a big brand; it’s being able to
show people that they’ll make money with you.
Screening franchisees
When looking to franchise into a second- or third-tier market (see Chapter 7
for info on tiers), make sure your franchisees have good relationships with
the local government. A good business track record in a particular locale is
often an indication that a potential franchisee is in good shape.
270

Franchising’s three barriers
Rick Wang of RetailCo, Inc., developed the three
barriers to Chinese-foreign cooperation that we
discuss in Chapter 7. He sees that the three bar-
riers are a particularly large issue in franchising:
 The barrier of mind: This first barrier is
something that both franchisor and fran-
chisee have to overcome. The franchisor
needs to get comfortable with transferring
its know-how and with operating in a for-
eign market with a different language and
culture. The franchisee should understand
why it needs to spend money to help build
the franchisor’s brand and why it should
continue to pay royalties after it has
received the know-how.
 The barrier of trust: Like the barrier of mind,
the barrier of trust affects both sides. The
franchisor must trust that the franchisee
will be interested in growing with the brand
over the long-term. The franchisee has to
believe that the franchisor won’t leave it
high and dry, without much service or sup-
port, after it collects its franchise fee.
 The barrier of discipline: This barrier refers
to the franchisee sticking to the franchisor’s
system. The franchisee needs to under-
stand the importance of consistency (occa-
sional gentle reminders help, too).

The most important part of screening franchisees is to see whether they
really share your vision and buy into the brand. You can find this information
only through multiple in-person interviews. You may also want to avoid fran-
chisees who’ve already been operating in your field. Their ways and habits
may transfer, which hurts consistency.
Protecting your company in the franchise agreement
The most costly problem you’re likely to face with a franchisee is that he or
she does something to damage the brand. Fortunately, China’s franchise laws
generally give as much (or more) protection to franchisors as Western coun-
tries’ laws do. Regardless, you should put some additional protections in
your agreements.
Your franchise agreements should contain provisions that allow you to termi-
nate the agreement for damaging the brand (or for other reasons), just as
they would in the West. However, you should also require franchisees to fur-
nish a security deposit against damaging the brand. (The deposit would be in
addition to the franchise fee and ongoing royalties.) Your agreement should
allow you to take the security deposit if you terminate the franchise agree-
ment for certain problems. It must be an amount that hurts the franchisee to
make him or her think twice about going off the reservation.
Most foreign franchisors use five-year contracts with their Chinese fran-
chisees, even though they use ten-year contracts elsewhere. Although such a
contract is standard practice in China, some people argue that you should
use the same term in China that you do elsewhere. The argument goes that
by signing shorter agreements, you’re not increasing your company’s protec-
tion; after all, a franchise agreement should allow you to terminate it in many
instances, anyway. On the other hand, you’re sending the franchisees the
message you don’t trust them, which may sow the seeds for future problems
in the relationship.
Other franchisee challenges
The biggest day-to-day issue with franchisees is getting them to stick to your
system. You need good controls to monitor and work with your franchisees,
particularly if they’re in different parts of China. Just installing video cameras
to monitor stores doesn’t work. You need to send a combination of secret
shoppers and company representatives in to look at the stores and speak
with the franchisees. It’s also vital that your company have a strong inven-
tory management and tracking system.
Another issue that can arise later is that a franchisee thinks he or she under-
stands your concept well enough to go independent. You may have a little
more leverage to prevent that in China than you would in the West. If your
271
Chapter 14: Selling in China

company controls the supply chain to the franchisee, it’s probably not a big
deal if the franchisee goes independent — he or she will have a hard time
competing with you. If you don’t have that leverage (particularly because the
concept is almost exclusive knowledge and system based), you face the same
risk as you’d take outside of China.
Direct-to-consumer
Companies are selling directly to Chinese consumers through media such as
catalogs, television shopping channels, and the Internet. Catalog selling has
existed in China for over ten years, but market penetration is still relatively
low. Catalog sales are concentrated in a small range of product types, such as
baby products, books, magazines, and clothing, although you may find
opportunities to sell other products through catalogs. One challenge is that
getting good prospective customer lists in China can be a challenge. Internet
sales are a mixture of stand-alone online stores and Web sites that have many
small sellers.
Shipping was initially unreliable, but domestic shipping within China is now
pretty good. Shipping collect on delivery (COD) to customers isn’t uncommon.
Online payment systems are pretty well established in China. Most cus-
tomers in China have accounts with banks that have developed electronic
payment systems in recent years. Therefore, individuals who have Internet
access are usually able to pay for products through online debits to their
bank accounts.
Selling services
Service areas that are growing particularly quickly in China include financial
services, healthcare, travel, and education. In a number of service areas,
Western brands have an edge over Chinese ones — particularly if they’re pro-
viding services that Chinese perceive to be more complex or more developed
in the West.
Selling services to Chinese consumers has a lot in common with selling prod-
ucts. Brands can be quite effective in marketing services in China; however,
the service industry hasn’t developed as many well-known brands yet. Brand-
building strategies are similar for services, except that giving the consumer
face with something intangible is harder.
Provide gifts or attractive membership cards — something tangible that can
confer face, especially if it identifies the customer with a high-end service
brand.
272
Part III: Conducting Daily Business 

Treating customers in a way that gives them face is particularly important
with high-end consumers. This type of customer service makes cultural
sense. For example, place a customer in the seat of honor when dining with
him or her. (For more on cultural understanding, see Chapter 11.)
Chinese consumers aren’t as sophisticated in evaluating services as Western
customers are. Therefore, you have to educate the consumer on your offer-
ing. Your salespeople need to be good at fact-based selling (which we discuss
earlier in this chapter).
Selling Business-to-Business
You can break down business-to-business (B2B) selling into the broad cate-
gories of products and services: The large product categories of B2B sales in
China are
 Product components
 Raw materials
 Capital equipment (such as factory machines and telecom equipment)
On the service side, businesses are commonly selling other businesses the
following:
 Consulting
 Software/IT outsourcing
 Financial services
Businesses’ purchasing decisions are more complex than consumers’. If
you’re selling to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), you have to sell at multiple
layers of the same organization. That’s because SOEs have a number of
people involved in making purchasing decisions. Therefore, building good
and trusting relationships with these people is important.
Private companies’ purchasing decisions are generally all made by one
person — the owner. Don’t waste time pitching to middle-level employees.
Employees usually have little empowerment in Chinese companies.
In open, competitive industries (such as garment industries), companies are
used to and are reasonably receptive to cold-calling. However, in certain
industries dominated by large companies that the government highly regu-
lates and protects (such as in oil production), you need introductions to get
273
Chapter 14: Selling in China

in the door because they operate in a more “members-only” type of 
environment.
Here are some tips for courting B2B sales:
 When selling to businesses, have a nice, glossy brochure. Fortunately,
you can print them in China for a good deal less than in the West.
 Chinese companies are open to speaking with your existing customers
for references. If possible, make that step easy for them and bring them
around to meet some of your customers.
 The Chinese are beginning to enjoy traveling. Organizing business/
leisure conferences for large customers can be effective, and this
method is becoming more common.

In this part . . .
H
ere, we take a close look at building relationships in
China and show you their value. Business etiquette
is important no matter where you do business, but
because of China’s deep cultural traditions, being respect-
ful and polite seems to take on even more importance.
This part explains how to follow protocol and discusses
how to avoid behavior that may unexpectedly hurt your
dealings with the Chinese. The Chinese love their food
and like to show visiting foreigners the many varieties of
Chinese delicacies, so we also show you how to enjoy the
traditional Chinese banquet that’s just another part of
doing business in China.

M
any Westerners have heard that relationships are critical to doing
business in China. In fact, in the West, a great deal of mystique sur-
rounds the way business relationships work in this corner of Asia. Make no
mistake about it — relationships are important to doing business in China;
however, they’re not significantly more important than they are in the West.
This chapter explains what these relationships are, what benefits they can
bring, and how to effectively develop them.
You Scratch My Back, I’ll Scratch 
Yours: Introducing Guan Xi
The Chinese term for relationships, which we use throughout this book, 
is guan xi (gwon shee). Guan xi has no literal translation to English, but 
generally, the Chinese use the expression you (yo) guan xi, or “you have guan
xi,” to mean that someone has a particular relationship or is generally well
connected. The bottom line is that you either have it or don’t — and you 
definitely want to have guan xi.

In some ways, doing business with guan xi is similar to the way people do
business in the West. Guan xi is a more muscular form of the principle that
it’s not what you know; it’s who you know. Guan xi is mainly based on trust
and the understanding that favors should be returned, which are also impor-
tant in Western business relationships. However, subtle and important differ-
ences crop up between the way these factors work in the West and in Chinese
guan xi. The following sections help you understand those differences.
In the end, a good business plan can succeed without good guan xi (although
you’re likely to develop good guan xi as you succeed, because everybody
loves a winner); likewise, a bad business plan will fail even with the best 
possible guan xi. See Chapter 4 for more about planning for China.
Trusting performance
Parties must trust each other in order to have guan xi. (No, they don’t need
trust because they’re doing something illegal and have to trust each other to
keep quiet!) The trust upon which guan xi rests is broader and more about
common sense. For example, if an official with whom you have guan xi promises
to expedite an approval process, he or she trusts that you have your documen-
tation in order and that your application doesn’t contain any surprises.
China has neither credit reporting agencies nor a Better Business Bureau, so
good information on potential business associates is hard to come by from
official sources. This situation makes guan xi that much more necessary for
doing business. Trust is an important factor because, as we discuss later in
this chapter, Chinese businesspeople frequently recommend their business
contacts to one another. If a businessperson provides a reference for some-
body who subsequently does a bad job, then the referring person ends up
looking bad and his or her guan xi weakens.
Guan xi is based on implied reciprocity. Many Westerners have the misconcep-
tion that if you “buy” the right Chinese officials, you can accomplish anything.
Although China, like all countries, has a certain level of corruption, officials who
can be paid off are the exception, not the rule. That said, expecting something in
return when you make an effort on someone else’s behalf is human nature.
In practice, people with whom you have guan xi will usually help you while
expecting something in return in the future. In other words, if the Chinese
party thinks you can help in the future, he or she will view the favor as an
investment. This practice may be analogous to the scene in the first
Godfather movie where Vito Corleone promises to help the funeral parlor
owner. In the scene, Corleone says he’ll help the parlor owner get revenge
but that he may someday call upon the parlor owner to pay back the favor.
Unlike the Godfather though, in guan xi, the Chinese person is unlikely to
come right out and tell you that he or she expects something in return.
278
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Repaying favors
Beyond gaining someone’s trust, you have to figure out how to repay the
favor. The range of possibilities is endless, from sharing a few drinks or
dinner to helping an official’s relatives find jobs (hopefully not with your
company). Some repayment obligations may not be worth the favor you’re
getting. Carefully weigh what you can do to repay — and are comfortable
with — before accepting favors.
Never offer money when asking for a favor. Offering a bribe is highly insulting
to all but the most corrupt officials. In addition, bribing or attempting to
bribe a foreign government official may violate your home country’s laws,
such as the United States’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Guan xi isn’t about
bribes and corruption; it’s about developing long-term mutually beneficial
relationships that can help your business grow and profit in China.
Beyond bribes, offering up an obvious quid pro quo when asking for a favor 
is usually bad form. If you have a commercial arrangement to propose, that’s
fine. Don’t couch it in terms of doing favors, though.
One of the crucial aspects of developing guan xi is to constantly think about
how you can help people you know. You shouldn’t forget when people do
favors for you, and you should try to do even small favors for them without
being asked. When thinking about the possible ways to grant or repay a favor,
keep the following ideas in mind:
279
Chapter 15: Fostering Fruitful Friendships: The Art of Guan Xi
Calling in favors for a speedy response
Guan xi sometimes can help with relatively
mundane tasks. Here’s the story of one busi-
nessman from Taiwan who’s based in Shanghai:
When he moved into his new apartment, he
called the phone company (a monopoly) to install
broadband Internet. The phone company told
him that it had no broadband lines available and
that he should call back the next day. The next
day the story was the same, as was the day after
that and the day after that. Finally, he got so 
frustrated that he went to the office where the
Internet installation scheduler worked. He went
to the scheduler’s office and pleaded his case.
The scheduler unsympathetically opened his
scheduling book, looked through it for a moment,
and then said, “I’m sorry, but we have no lines
available.” The businessman left in a huff.
The man then called a friend who had previ-
ously told him that he knew people at the phone
company. The friend placed a phone call, and
within a few days, the Internet was installed!

 At the time that somebody does you a favor, she may not have any spe-
cific repayment in mind — she may simply feel that you’re going places
and may be able to help her down the road. Asking whether she can use
your help in any way doesn’t hurt. She may tell you not to worry about
it, but don’t take such a denial literally — be ready to repay the favor
when you see an opportunity.
 Often you make the repayment over time, though not always. For example,
you may know a certain person who’d be a good introduction for your new
Chinese contact. To develop guan xi with your new contact, introducing
this person early in the relationship may be a good starting point.
 Even small favors, such as editing some English for a person’s business
or advising him on a trip to your country, are appreciated and can help
to build your guan xi.
 Most Chinese prefer to develop ongoing relationships rather than doing
mutual one-off favors. At the start of a relationship, try to think of what
your obligations may eventually amount to. Depending on whom you’re
dealing with, you may not be comfortable receiving favors from a partic-
ular person. Guan xi obligations are very important, and you risk seri-
ously offending someone if you refuse a later request for help. Therefore,
it’s vital that you assess who is offering to help you and think about
whether you’d really want to help him or her later.
The best way to deal with a request you’re uncomfortable with is to avoid
putting yourself in that situation in the first place. If you do find yourself in
such a situation, though, refuse without using very direct language to help the
other party save face (see Chapter 11). In many cases, rather than saying you
can’t do it, it’s better to say something to the effect of “it may be difficult.”
Then try to think of a compromise you’re comfortable with. Of course, you
can’t make everybody happy all the time.
Developing guan xi in government 
and business
Many foreigners may find it unusual that, in China, having relationships with
both businesspeople and government officials is a good thing. Even maintain-
ing a friendly relationship with a relatively low-ranking government employee
can pay off.
The People’s Republic: Guan xi with government officials
Guan xi with government officials can be quite helpful in China, especially
when you need to navigate the opaque processes and bureaucracies of the
Chinese government. If you develop relationships with the right officials, they
may be able to
280
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

 Advise you in advance about whether you’re likely to receive approval
(or alternately, tell you what you need to do for approval); this boost
can spare you a lot of time and money.
 Expedite the approval process in certain situations.
 Use a favorable interpretation of the law to help you — for example, 
an official may read the law in a way that gives your business the most
favorable tax treatment possible (keeping in mind that the national and
local governments have complicated tax schemes to provide incentives
for the development of certain industries).
 Tell you about future developments that may be important to your 
business, such as road construction or possible changes in the law.
Guan xi also may come into play when submitting competitive proposals for
a project, such as property development. Having a good relationship with the
deciding officials definitely gives you an edge.
Westerners commonly misunderstand why having good guan xi with the 
government is so important. The main point is that guan xi won’t get officials
to break rules for you. Instead, it may get them to use the rules’ inherent 
flexibility to help you out.
The people: Guan xi with Chinese businesspeople
The Chinese are more inclined to mix friendship and business than most
Westerners are. In fact, many Chinese prefer to do business with people
they’re comfortable with. Otherwise, the Chinese prefer to do business 
with people their friends can vouch for.
Although using such connections is normal in the West, the difference is that
a personal validation that’s unrelated to business (for instance, “Zhang is a
good guy”) may carry almost as much weight as a business one (“Zhang did 
a great job installing my plumbing”). This idea is an important application of
the trust factor of guan xi; although the person vouching for Zhang may not
know firsthand whether he’s a good contractor, she’s comfortable with Zhang
and trusts that Zhang does a good job in his business because of the way he
handles himself in their personal dealings. Therefore, if you develop good
guan xi with businesspeople, they may refer customers to you. As always,
though, remember the principle of reciprocity — you may need to hire at
least some of the suppliers that they refer to you.
One of the most common business favors is to give or receive introductions
to one’s contacts. Asking for an introduction (or for other reasonable favors)
is fair game, provided you believe the other person is comfortable with you
and will be comfortable with the favor you’re asking. You may want to be a
bit indirect, though, if you haven’t known the person you’re asking that long.
281
Chapter 15: Fostering Fruitful Friendships: The Art of Guan Xi

For example, instead of asking for an introduction to Ms. Zhu, you may want
to ask whether the other person can introduce you to someone who can help
you with such-and-such.
People often provide introductions over a meal. In China, friends rarely split
bills — they take turns paying. If someone is giving you an introduction,
remember who’s doing whom the favor. You should pay for the entire bill if
the meal is just the three of you, provided that the person arranging the meal
lets you do so.
Developing Your Own Guan Xi
Many people who arrive in China don’t have a good sense of whom they
should have guan xi with. In that case, reaching out to other foreigners who
have some experience in where you want to be, or are doing what you want
to do, is a good start. They can hopefully give you some idea of whom to
create guan xi with.
After identifying your guan xi targets, you often need to build bridges to reach
them. Along the way, you have to remember two of the cardinal rules of guan xi:
 Follow through on your promises.
 Reciprocate.
The following sections help guide you through this process.
Starting from square one: Reaching out
The key to developing guan xi is to be proactive. In general, your goal should
be to interact with as many people as possible. Don’t be afraid of being an
obvious networker — in China, most people are networking pretty much all
the time. In fact, at many networking events, you encounter Chinese who are
“serial networkers,” people who pass you their business cards without saying
hello or introducing themselves first. Although you don’t want to come off as
a serial networker, you should exercise good social etiquette (see Chapter 16)
and be upfront that you’re in China for a particular purpose.
In your initial contacts, you want to
 Get introductions to people who are involved in your area (industry or
geography) of interest
 Get the big picture of whom you should be trying to meet and what
resources are available to help you
282
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

The following sections explain how you can reach out — both East and West.
Making contact first with other Westerners
If you’re a Westerner who speaks no Chinese, who’s in China for the first
time, and who has no pre-existing contacts, how do you find people to
develop guan xi with? Often, the best way is to meet and reach out to people
in the Western business community.
In Beijing and Shanghai, the Western business community is quite diverse,
from small-business owners to Fortune 500 executives, recent college gradu-
ates to people with over ten years of experience in China. Their industries
run the gamut from import/export to financial services. In other cities and
towns, the Western community is usually more limited — often mostly people
involved in manufacturing or import/export.
In most cases, Westerners in China are very approachable. They tend to feel a
sense of being “in it together” with other Westerners, so they’re often willing
to speak with newly arrived Westerners. One way to approach cold-calling 
(or e-mailing) other Westerners is to contact people with whom you have
something in common: for example, alumni of your school, people in a 
business similar to your own, or people from the same state or province.
Developing Chinese connections
In addition to talking to Westerners in China, you can begin with Chinese
people who are close to the Western business community. They speak
English and can often provide a bridge to important Chinese contacts.
You may be able to develop guan xi with some government officials right 
off the bat. If you’re interested in doing business in a less developed part 
of China or in a special economic zone (SEZ), you may find that government
officials — especially those who deal with foreign investment — may be more
interested in meeting with you. Many of these officials are motivated by
283
Chapter 15: Fostering Fruitful Friendships: The Art of Guan Xi
Growing older, growing guan xi
All other things being equal, the older or more
experienced you are, the faster your guan xi will
develop. This concept is consistent with the
underlying idea of reciprocity. The more accom-
plishments under your belt, the more likely
you’re able to offer the Chinese something of
value. Also, as members of a Confucian society,
the Chinese are generally more reverent of age
than Westerners are. You can see this respect
for age in the Chinese leadership, who tend to
be fairly aged by Western standards.

bringing investments and jobs to their areas of responsibility. If your project
is big enough (or if they’re desperate enough), they may want to meet you
more than you want to meet them! For more on dealing with government 
officials, see Chapter 8.
Gathering in mixed company
Many Western countries have chambers of commerce in larger Chinese 
cities. The chambers of commerce frequently hold networking and socializing
events that draw both foreign businesspeople and Chinese who speak English
well. The chambers and other organizations also hold industry-specific
events. (See Chapter 4 for other places and strategies to start networking.)
These events may draw people who are more established and are therefore
able to provide you with more assistance.
In the larger cities, networking and socializing events occur every day of the
week (usually several per day, actually). You can get information about these
events by finding Web sites serving expatriates in those cities or by contact-
ing your home country’s nearest chamber of commerce in China.
If a newbie Westerner arrives in a part of China that’s off the beaten path, fewer
formal networking events and organizations are available. However, the Western
business communities will probably be more welcoming. And that Westerner
may stand out more, which can make developing Chinese contacts easier.
Beware of people who make claims about how their guan xi enables them to
do impressive things. Both Chinese and Westerners are prone to exaggerating
their connections, usually just to seem more important but sometimes
because they want something from you. When dealing with the Chinese 
especially, telling who really has the guan xi and who doesn’t can be difficult;
however, as a general rule, the more impressive the claim, the less likely it is
to be true. Try to avoid committing too much on your end until you figure out
whether somebody can really deliver.
Building bridges to your target contacts
As you speak with people and begin to crystallize your thinking about whom
you want to develop guan xi with (see Chapter 4), visualize yourself as being
on one side of a river and your targets on the other. The people who consti-
tute your network become planks in a bridge over the river. With each person
you meet, you hope that he or she can introduce you to someone who can
bring you closer to the other side. When you’re finished building your bridge,
the planks near where you started are likely to be mostly Western, while the
planks near your targets are likely to be Chinese.
284
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Strengthening ties through food, drink, and social calls
Building the bridge is all about forming and growing a web of contacts. When
you meet interesting people, follow up with them by having lunch or drinks,
or by stopping in at their offices.
After your initial follow-up, think about arranging group meals with your 
contacts. Meals are effective relationship-building tools — particularly with
Chinese. Chinese-style meals take place around circular tables that have
turntables (lazy Susans) on them. This setup allows everyone to share food,
which makes the meals friendlier and more interactive. (See Chapter 16 for
more information on social dining.) In fact, the Chinese generally prefer to
socialize and drink in restaurants rather than in bars. Here are several rea-
sons to arrange group meals:
 They solidify relationships with your contacts.
 They may provide your contacts with valuable connections.
 Your contacts may bring additional people for you to meet.
 You may receive invitations to attend others’ group meals, which are
fantastic networking opportunities.
Traditionally, sharing alcohol has also been an important facet of developing
trust in China. Northern Chinese tend to be the heaviest social drinkers. In
major cities, sharing drinks is less a staple of doing business than it used to
be; however, many local government officials still like to imbibe heavily from
time to time.
A number of Chinese people feel more comfortable with people after they’ve
shared some drinks. Alcohol can also help to minimize language barriers
because when people drink and lose inhibitions, they tend to make greater
efforts to communicate directly with each other across languages. These
efforts are often just attempts at rudimentary English (or Chinese) phrases,
such as “Chinese food very good.” Such interactions, particularly if one has
been imbibing, may be humorous and endearing. Also, the Chinese know that
people are more honest when drinking.
If a person refuses to drink much when his or her host is heavily imbibing, the
host may lose face. However, as a Westerner, you can get away without drink-
ing much (or drinking at all) more easily than the Chinese can — in other
words, your reticence won’t be that offensive. If you want to moderate (or
eliminate) your intake, it’s best to politely tell your host beforehand. Perhaps
have a “designated drinker” for your side if you don’t want to drink much.
285
Chapter 15: Fostering Fruitful Friendships: The Art of Guan Xi

Even if the people you meet while drinking and dining and through other
avenues don’t seem to be directly involved in your target business, they
probably know people who know people; therefore, be open-minded about
meeting a variety of people — not just people within your industry.
Dealing with language issues
When a newbie Westerner finally gets to the Chinese part of the bridge, he 
or she has to deal with the language issue. Certainly, all Westerners in China
should know a few basic Chinese phrases, such as hello, thank you, and good-
bye (see the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book). Beyond that, however, you
need to use interpreters (see Chapter 2).
Following through on your promises
When seeking to develop relationships, you must remember the two bases 
of guan xi: trust and implied reciprocity. You can’t earn trust overnight, of
course. Hopefully, you receive introductions from people who can vouch for
you; if not, the problem isn’t impossible — developing trust will just take
more time.
Keep in mind that China isn’t the place that the West frequently portrays it 
to be — cheats are the exception rather than the rule. Besides receiving an
endorsement, you have other ways to earn trust as well:
 Diligently maintain relationships and have periodic contact with your
targets because familiarity by itself creates some level of trust.
 Keep small promises, such as the promise to call by a certain time.
Breaking a promise is a big taboo in Chinese culture.
 Provide examples of how you’ve done business in an honest way in 
the past.
 Tell somebody information about yourself or your business that’s 
somewhat sensitive (but not unflattering!).
You shouldn’t lie or exaggerate (or technically, get caught doing so).
Damaging your credibility is a problem anywhere, but the news of your
misstep may travel more quickly in China, given the reliance on unoffi-
cial channels (like guan xi) to gather information on prospective busi-
ness contacts.

Putting your best foot forward
If you represent a large multinational corporation, everyone already assumes
that you can do your part — local officials will covet your company’s poten-
tial investment and jobs. For the newbie lone Westerner, implying that you
can reciprocate favors is a bit more complicated.
Implying that you can reciprocate favors is a lot like interviewing for a job —
you want to build your capabilities up as much as possible without creating 
a potential credibility crisis. Your goal is for the Chinese side to believe that
you (or your company) are committed to your proposal and that you have
the resources to make it work.
Some Westerners have good access to capital and a strong sense of how to
execute their businesses that shows through to people who are considering
doing them a favor. For Westerners who are less well equipped, the key is to
downplay your weaknesses. Be yourself, but make sure you appear as strong
as possible.
For example, if you don’t have much money but you know something about
investing, you may want to talk some about investing (without overdoing it,
of course). Many Chinese would assume that a Westerner who’s knowledge-
able about investing actually has money to invest. That way, you appear to be
in a strong position to repay the favor at some time in the future. Of course,
keep working on addressing any weaknesses — continue looking for potential
investors and develop your technical know-how.
Chinese hold some favorable stereotypes of Westerners — in particular, they
think Westerners have superior access to capital and strong, sophisticated
technical know-how. Therefore, consider playing into the stereotypes. For one,
looking “Western” helps. That means dressing well — Chinese business fash-
ion is a bit plain, so try to exhibit some business-appropriate flair (think GQ) 
if you’re comfortable. Also, Chinese are very brand conscious with high-end
items; however, they tend to know only the most obvious names in a given
category, such as Rolex and Louis Vuitton. Displaying expensive wrist hard-
ware and clothing accessories is by no means a necessity, but it can help.
Looking at the Limitations of Guan Xi
Here are a couple reasons that relying on guan xi can come back to bite you:
 Guan xi is great until one of your key relationships changes jobs or posi-
tions. The situation’s bad if the replacement doesn’t know you; it’s even
worse if she and her predecessor were rivals — then, she may hold your
287
Chapter 15: Fostering Fruitful Friendships: The Art of Guan Xi

relationship with her predecessor against you! If you were dependant upon
the person who changed jobs, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
 Everybody has bosses. Although your contact may have told you or
promised you one thing, his superiors may not approve it. This situation
happens often with government officials who misjudge how their higher
ups will react. So even though your contact meant what he told you, in a
place as bureaucratic as China is, things are almost always subject to
somebody else’s approval.
Although good guan xi is great to have, make sure you have a Plan B in case
your contact doesn’t come through.

Saying and Doing the Right Things:
Chinese Business Etiquette
In This Chapter
 Behaving appropriately in business and social settings
 Mastering the fine art of banqueting
 Exchanging symbols of gratitude
W
ith any business dealing, etiquette is key to winning over a new 
client or partner. The same holds true for China, where a difference in
traditions can lead to some awkward, deal-breaking moments. This chapter
advises you on the proper way to be polite while in a meeting, explains how
to handle the marathon meals known as Chinese banquets, and offers up
some useful information on how to behave in China.
Minding Your Business Manners
Some people say good manners make good business, and that’s certainly 
the way things work in China. Good impressions generally lead to good 
relationships, and good relationships lead to good business opportunities
(see Chapter 15 for info on relationships). For the first-time visitor to China,
getting to know how to behave can be almost overwhelming. After you get
into the swing of things, however, you find that being polite and good man-
nered is the only way to do business in China.
Although you may find Chinese people to be reserved at times, they’re generally
very approachable. Getting the relationships going in the right direction just
takes time. So be yourself — honest, business-like, and polite. Follow the lead of
your Chinese hosts in China. In no time, you’ll be making introductions, giving
out your Chinese business card, and impressing the Chinese along the way.

Note: You may want to present a gift at your final meeting or banquet. For
more information, see “Tokens of Appreciation: Giving Gifts Correctly,” at the
end of this chapter. For details specific to business meetings, go to Chapter 11.
Dressing for success
Chinese businesspeople tend to dress conservatively. Here’s what men and
women wear:
 Men: Dark suits are popular for men in China. You should always wear a
suit and tie to business meetings and banquets unless you’re specifically
doing something like touring a factory. Your tie shouldn’t be too loud.
 Women: Businesswomen tend to dress very modestly in China. Revealing
necklines, flashy jewelry, or skimpy skirts aren’t appropriate. Lean toward
classic designs and silhouettes rather than following the latest trends.
If you’re a seasoned female executive and you’ll be leading discussions
for your firm, dress more conservatively. The most important things are
to determine whether your objective is to blend in or be seen, and to
dress right for the occasion.
Visiting a factory in China is something many foreigners do, so plan to
change clothes if your schedule allows. Many times, you won’t have the
opportunity to swap your business attire for more casual gear, but if you do,
women should go with slacks and flat shoes. For men, dress down into casual
pants and a nice shirt.
Within reason, dressing a bit less conservatively and wearing more sophisti-
cated clothes than the Chinese do is okay. For men, this may be a lighter
shade of suit color compared to a traditional dark suit. Women may opt for
brighter colors or patterns (perhaps follow the lead of Vice Premier Wu Yi).
Just don’t go overboard and get too flashy.
A good-quality watch can go a long way in making an impression with the
Chinese. The Chinese are particularly fond of expensive watches because
they indicate status, so if you have one, plan to wear it.
Modesty doesn’t mean dressing down. Opt for clothes with good workman-
ship, and make a statement with the way you’re dressed — you want to
demonstrate to the Chinese that you’re a successful businessperson. The
Chinese like to see evidence that you’ve reached a certain level of success 
or rank within your company and that you know how to dress accordingly.
290
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Greeting and meeting the Chinese
Meeting the Chinese is more formal than what you’re likely used to because
you need to give face to the person you’re meeting. (For more about face, go
to Chapter 11.) You also need to take more time to meet people properly. The
Chinese usually greet foreigners with a handshake — a less-than-firm hand-
shake, so don’t give them a bone-crushing handshake in return. The Chinese
may just nod their head ever so slightly when they greet you.
The Chinese strongly value seniority and want to know who the company’s
leaders are. Introducing the two most senior executives to each other first is
customary. Before people sit down, the leaders generally introduce them-
selves (unless one of the Chinese people knows you and wants to personally
introduce you to a higher-ranking person). Others are then introduced —
usually in descending order of rank within the company. Sometimes introduc-
tions are repeated at the opening of the meeting as the head executive from
each side introduces his or her team one by one.
Get up on your feet and do a proper introduction. Common courtesy in China
calls for you to be on your feet when greeting somebody, especially at banquets
(see the upcoming section “Enjoying a Chinese Banquet” for info on dining).
When addressing someone, refer to the person’s family name, not his or her
given name. The first name you see on a Chinese person’s business card is
the family name (see the next section for info on business cards). Refer to the
person as Mr., Mrs., or Miss, even outside the business realm.
By placing the family name in front of the given name, the Chinese show
respect for their elders. Thus, Ms. Li Shu Min is Ms. Li, and Mr. Xu Bao Jun is
Mr. Xu (pronounced shoo). They’ll likely call you by your surname, too. A
safe way for the Chinese to address women is to call them Madame, so
expect they may refer to you this way.
You can win more points by referring to people by their titles, followed by last
names. For example, you may address Chairman Wang or General Manager Han.
Presenting your business card
Exchanging business cards in China is almost a formal ceremony in itself.
With a little practice, you can master the art of presenting your business card
the right way in China.
291
Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette

Before you go to China, have some business cards made up in Mandarin
Chinese. Figure 16-1 shows a sample card. At a minimum, they should 
include your
 Name
 Title
 Company
 E-mail address
You may want to include your mobile phone number(s) on your card.
Providing your home mobile phone number is useful so the Chinese can call
you at home due to the time difference (they don’t usually expect you to take
their call at 3 a.m. — don’t worry!). If you’ll have a permanent China number
at which they can reach you on future trips, including that is a good idea, too.
One side of the card should be in English, the other side, Chinese. Assuming
that you’ll primarily be on the mainland, use so-called simplified Chinese
characters for your business cards, not the traditional characters used in
Taiwan and Hong Kong. And bring plenty of business cards to China — you’ll
need them.

Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Business card translations work best if you have a Chinese contact who can
help guide you with the translation. If not, you need to find a reputable trans-
lation services company (see Chapter 2 for details).
After you get a translation of your name and/or that of your company name,
bounce it off of some native Chinese speakers whose judgment you trust.
Translators usually translate people’s names, and sometimes companies’
names, by using Chinese words that have similar sounds. However, the
Chinese names you use should not only sound similar but also have positive
meanings — the Chinese frequently compliment a well-chosen name or notice
an odd-sounding one. When involving several people’s opinions on Chinese
names, you’ll rarely get a clear consensus on the best name; however, you
can usually eliminate the bad ones.
You usually exchange business cards before you sit down to do business or
start a banquet. Who goes first usually doesn’t matter. It’s not unusual to give
somebody a business card whenever you first meet — even if the occasion 
is social.
When you present a business card, use both hands to hold the long side of the
card as you present it to the person you’re being introduced to. Present your
card with the Chinese side facing up. When the Chinese person presents a busi-
ness card to you, be sure to receive it with both hands, hold it the same way he
or she handed it to you, and noticeably study the card for a short while.
Treat a person’s business card with respect. Don’t just shove it into your
pocket after you receive it. To be polite, carefully put the business card away.
You can also place the card on the table. This act helps you to remember who
everyone is. And never write on a business card that you receive from a
Chinese person.
Behaving yourself in Chinese company
Understand that you’re a guest in China. In other words, you need to show
respect for the way things work and don’t work in China. Overinflated egos,
overconfidence, and a lack of humility don’t go over well in China.
Getting the little things right in China helps you to get the bigger things done
later. Here are some things you should know:
 Talking about controversial subjects: Avoid bringing up the subjects 
of politics and religion at all costs. Stay away from any references to
Taiwan, the Dali Lama, or the Falun Gong.
293
Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette

Your Chinese host may start discussing political or religious topics with
you. He or she may be curious to hear your views as an outsider and may
feel more comfortable expressing impolitic views because you’re a for-
eigner. If this happens, tread very carefully. Until you’re absolutely certain
of your host’s views, it’s best to discuss many of these topics by praising
the government overall while suggesting that certain things can be done
better (unless you completely agree with the government, that is!).
 Being late: The Chinese are very punctual. Be sure you show up for
business meetings and banquets on time. If you may be late, make sure
you have a mobile phone number so you can contact your Chinese host.
 Being arrogant: The Chinese are very humble people, so acting pompous
or arrogant won’t get you very far. Check your ego when you check your
bags at the airport.
 Making too much personal contact: The Chinese people don’t engage 
in much physical contact with foreign visitors: no killer handshakes or
backslapping, please. And the only appropriate contact with a Chinese
businesswoman is a good handshake.
 Gesturing the wrong way: Don’t make any unusual facial expressions,
and avoid excessive use of your hands while talking to the Chinese
people. The Chinese are usually quite reserved in business meetings.
Although you don’t have to match their demeanor, you shouldn’t be
flamboyant.
 Being disrespectful to elders: Older people are revered in China. Treat
them with respect, and your Chinese host will respect you more.
 Using bad language or getting angry: Whatever you do, don’t use any
racial slurs or curse words when you’re in front of the Chinese. Getting
angry, unless it’s part of a negotiating tactic, is a big no-no (see Chap-
ter 6 for info on negotiating).
For details on following etiquette at meetings, see Chapter 11.
Enjoying a Chinese Banquet
The Chinese people have a long tradition of putting on elaborate banquets.
Banquets usually celebrate holidays, weddings, special occasions, and 
business dealings. They’re a great way to get to know your Chinese friends 
in a casual and relaxed setting. Most importantly, they’re a fun evening for
everybody, so relax and enjoy.
294
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Usually, the Chinese first host a banquet in your honor. It’s customary for the
visiting foreigners to reciprocate with a return banquet if your travel sched-
ule allows. See the “Returning the favor: Hosting a banquet” section later for
planning advice.
Knowing what to expect
Knowing how a Chinese banquet works shows your Chinese host that you
know a little bit about Chinese tradition and etiquette.
Take mental notes about the protocol that takes place during the evening so
you can be better prepared to play the role of host at the return banquet.
Arriving at the restaurant
Chinese banquets are generally held in private rooms at popular restaurants
known for their good atmosphere, food, and service. Often, the host chooses
one of his or her favorite restaurants where he or she knows the management
and staff.
Although Chinese banquets can take place at lunchtime, most start in the
early evening and last for two or so hours. The Chinese generally take their
meals earlier than many Westerners do — expect that a banquet in the
evening would start at 6 p.m. and end around 8 p.m.
Having your group arrive at the restaurant all together at the same time 
is a good idea. Be on time for the banquet, but don’t show up before your 
host arrives.
After your group is assembled at the restaurant, the leader of your group
should enter the room first, followed by other guests in rank order. The
highest-ranking host greets the leader of your group. The host then looks
after the honored guest during the course of the banquet.
Arranging the seating
Seating is extremely important at a Chinese banquet. Remain standing and
allow the host to arrange the proper seating.
The host first guides the most senior leader of your group to his or her place
at the table. The honored guest sits to the right of the host. The other mem-
bers of the hosting party guide the remaining guests to their appropriate
seats at the table.
295
Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette

At the table, the host usually sits facing the door to the banquet room. The
remaining guests are seated according to rank in the remaining seats, with
the lowest-ranked guest with his or her back to the door. Usually, an inter-
preter or two are mixed into the seating plan to assist with communication.
On your first banquet with your host, it’s helpful and often customary to pro-
vide a list of names and rank of your guests to the host before the banquet.
This step allows the host to organize the proper seating arrangements for the
banquet. Protocol is very important to the Chinese, so make it easy for them
to get everything right.
Understanding the table setting
Large, round banquet tables usually provide seating for up to 12 people. At
large state banquets or banquets to celebrate special occasions, such as
opening a company in China, you may see seating for 100 or more. A large
revolving tray, sometimes called a lazy Susan, rests in the center of the table.
Cold and/or hot towels may be available for you to wipe your hands on
before and after the meal. Just put the towel to the side of your place setting
when you’re through with it. Don’t be surprised to see the Chinese use the
towel to wipe their faces as well. Using the towel for your hands is okay, but
we don’t recommend wiping your face with it — the towels may not be as
hygienic as you may expect.
As for tableware, your chopsticks are to the right of the table setting. When
you aren’t using your chopsticks, rest them on the chopsticks holder to the
right of your setting. You have a plate and a bowl, a small dish for sauces, 
and a porcelain spoon for soup as part of your table setting. For drinks, you
receive a wine glass, a glass for water or beer, and a small glass for liquor.
Serving you the meal
After sipping some Chinese tea, expect to make some small talk, often over
snacks such as peanuts (avoid talking about politics or religion — see the
upcoming section titled “Keeping conversation light”). The banquet officially
begins when the host serves the honored guests to his or her right. At this
time, the host makes a toast and welcomes the guests at the table (see
“Toasting at banquets,” later in this chapter). Wait until the host begins the
meal before consuming any food or drinks.
After the host has started the meal, the other members of the Chinese group
begin serving the other guests at the table. The food at a Chinese banquet is
served family style. No individual portions are provided except for the soup
and dessert. Servers bring food courses to the table in what seems like rapid
succession of plates and more plates. They’re continually replacing your
used dishes with new ones.
296
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

When your bowl or plate gets messy during the meal, you can exchange it for
a clean one. Usually, the wait staff refreshes your tableware as needed. Don’t
worry about flagging down a waiter, but get the waiter’s attention if you need
to. Simply extend your arm behind your guest’s chair, and with your palm
facing downward, make a waving motion (you may want to ask a Chinese
friend to show you the gesture).
After the first few dishes, guests may help themselves to the food they like.
However, you can expect the Chinese hosts to continue to serve you food
throughout the meal. You can politely decline to have them serve you, but it
often doesn’t work!
Eating directly from the serving dish is very rude. You need to move the food
item from the serving plate to your own plate before you eat it.
Pacing yourself
A Chinese banquet is ultimately about having too much of a good thing,
which in the Chinese culture is an exception rather than the rule. Expect to
have too much to eat and drink. To avoid embarrassment, the host provides
too much food on purpose. Pace yourself and don’t overeat, especially at the
beginning of the banquet. Having twelve or more courses of food at a Chinese
banquet isn’t unusual.
If you clear your plate during one of the courses or finish your soup, you’re
signaling to the host that you want more food. Make sure you leave a little
food on your plate to avoid getting another serving from your Chinese host.
Another way to control the amount of food that gets to your plate is to
politely say to your hosts that you’re able to serve yourself. If you’re success-
ful with this request, you can manage the amount of food on your plate. As a
general rule, you’re expected to sample all the food. So managing the amount
that gets onto your plate is important. If your host insists on serving you, you
can leave the food on your plate or in your bowl. Servers clear it from the
table before the start of the next course.
297
Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette
Complimenting in China
The Chinese people are known to be humble.
Their culture places much importance on modesty
rather than showmanship. As a result, the Chinese
often deny any compliment that you may offer, so
don’t be surprised if when you compliment your
Chinese host, he or she politely declines it. You,
too, should expect compliments to be given by the
Chinese and be humble in return.

Keeping conversation light
You see a lot of toasting and eating during a banquet, but between eating and
toasting, you won’t talk much about business. Don’t expect any high-level
business discussions at Chinese banquets, and don’t try to start those con-
versations. Generally, a lot of alcohol flows during a banquet, so it’s not an
appropriate time to bring up important business matters.
Chinese banquets are all about getting to know your friends better, so use the
time to build a relationship with Chinese contacts who can help build your
business. Although you won’t be talking much business, you certainly can
talk about other topics that make good conversation. All the members of the
team can engage in small talk, but junior members should let the senior
people take the lead. Here are some possible subjects:
 The progress China is making
 How fast life in China is changing
 How people’s lives are improving
 Your home country
Stay away from family matters — unless you know your host well — and
avoid talking about politics or religion.
Be sure to compliment your host on the fine quality of the food more than
once during the course of the banquet. If you particularly like one dish, say
so. You’ll likely get another helping as a result!
Finishing the meal
You know you’re getting toward the end of the banquet when the rice or the
noodles reach the table. Then the dessert is served — that’s your signal that
the meal is (finally!) over. Soon after everyone has finished this course, the
Chinese host says some closing remarks or gives a final toast. It’s polite for
the honored guest to say a few words, too. The Chinese host then stand ups,
says a few more remarks, and thanks you for coming to the banquet. Now is
the time to thank your hosts, say good night, and prepare to leave very soon.
The banquet ends promptly, and there’s very little discussion after dinner.
Some members of the Chinese delegation may see you outside to make sure
your transportation has been arranged. Other members of the Chinese dele-
gation stay in the dining room and settle the bill.
Saying thank you at the end of the banquet is usually enough. If you see the
Chinese delegation the next day, be sure to tell them how wonderful the evening
was. If you’ve had visitors from overseas from headquarters, they may send a
note to the host when they return home to thank them for their hospitality.
298
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Don’t offer to pay for the meal or share in the costs in any way — it’s not
appropriate. You get your turn to host and pay the bill when you hold the
return banquet (see “Returning the favor: Hosting a banquet”).
Navigating the many courses
Having ten or more courses served at a Chinese banquet is customary. The
greater number of courses, the harder the Chinese host is trying to impress
the guests. And a more exotic choice of foods is usually a signal that the
Chinese think you’re worth impressing.
You can get a sense of what dishes will be served by reading the special
menu for the banquet that’s placed on the table. If it’s in Chinese, ask one of
your hosts to explain what’ll be served. He or she will likely be delighted to
tell you about the courses and specialties. Getting this info beforehand is a
good way to prepare to pace yourself — you know how many courses are
coming your way!
Cold dishes to start
The banquet begins with cold dishes or appetizers on small plates. Usually,
servers bring out an even number of cold dishes. You’ll likely be served cold
luncheon meats and often a cold appetizer such as jellyfish. Take a small
sampling of each kind to be polite, even if you can’t tell what food is. Asking
what the food is before you sample a dish is okay.
299
Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette
Dishing up regional cuisine
So many wonderful regional cuisines and local
foods are served in China. From the Southwest
of China comes Sichuan-style food. It lives up to
its reputation for being hot and very spicy. Two
of the most popular dishes from Sichuan are
twice-cooked pork and kung pao chicken.
To the North, you find Beijing-style food to be
blander but very tasty. It’s more of a collection of
foods from around the country, influenced espe-
cially by the Northeast. Noteworthy delicacies
include Beijing’s wonderful Peking duck, hot and
sour soup, and lots of noodles and dumplings.
Cantonese food is the most common Chinese
food in the West. It includes dim sum. Dim sum
involves a wide variety of delicious individual
small dishes served Cantonese style in small
wooden baskets. Usually, these well-presented
dishes include such tasty morsels as spring rolls
and pork buns.
In and around Shanghai, you may be treated to
some refined Chinese cuisine that’s been influ-
enced by bordering provinces. The Shanghainese
cooks are particularly noted for their famous
drunken chicken dish and wonderful Shanghai
dumplings.

If you really have an issue with eating something (such as bull’s penis), just
leave it on your plate. But you should know that getting adventurous and
eating what the Chinese do gives you more face. (See Chapter 11 for info on
gaining face.)
Soup for all
After the servers clear the cold dishes from the table, you can expect to get a
soup. Usually, the waiter or waitress serves you the soup by ladling it out from
a large bowl into individual servings. Don’t serve yourself. Selected varieties
can include shark’s fin soup, crab with corn, and sometimes turtle or snake
soup. If you finish all your soup, you’ll likely get a generous second serving.
More to come
The main dishes begin to appear after the soup course. China offers many 
different regional and local cuisines, so you’ll likely receive a wide assort-
ment of the hot dishes. The main courses often include
 Chicken
 Roast duck
 Suckling pig
 Fresh-cooked vegetables
 Plenty of seafood, including crab, conch, shrimp, abalone (mollusks),
and sliced sea slugs (so-called sea cucumbers)
Don’t be turned off by exotic-sounding dish names such as 1,000-year-old
eggs and stinky tofu.
If you can’t eat a certain food due to an allergy, for example, be sure to tell
the host sitting next to you before the meal begins. The host can then alert
the server to your special request.
Some foreigners don’t like the texture or taste of some Chinese delicacies
such as sea cucumbers. We recommend that you first experiment with this
food at another time and place other than the banquet. If you’re unsure of
whether you’ll like something, just leave it on your plate. The servers will
take it away after the course is finished.
Try the fish
Usually, fish is the final main course (that may depend on the province you’re
visiting). Steamed whole fish with a light sauce is a wonderful Chinese
delight. You should know that the Chinese eat most parts of the fish from the
bony head to the skinny tail. And don’t be surprised if your senior leader is
300
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

served the lips of the fish. Seriously, fish lips are a delicacy! The fish is gener-
ally served on the bone, with the tail and head still in place. When the fish
course arrives at the table, it’s placed with the head of the fish pointed at the
honorable guest. You’re expected to help yourself to your own small piece of
fish. Sometimes the waiters may serve you a piece.
The Chinese never flip or turn over the fish to get to the other side of the
bone. Turning the fish over is considered bad luck. Never turn over the fish.
Just leave it for the server to deal with.
Pile on the rice
Serving rice toward the end of the meal is customary. (Sometimes Chinese
noodles replace rice.) Rice isn’t served until the end, so don’t ask for it
during the meal. Serving rice toward the end of the meal is really a gesture 
by the Chinese host to make sure you’re completely filled up. Your host
wouldn’t want you to leave a Chinese banquet feeling hungry!
Don’t devour too much rice. You don’t want to signal to your host that you’re
still hungry toward the end of the meal.
Have your just desserts
Finally, you arrive at the last dish for the evening. The dessert may be cake,
pudding, or fresh fruit. By now, you’re probably so stuffed that you can’t look
at another thing. Even if you’re full, try to eat a sampling to be polite.
Eating the Chinese way: Using chopsticks
The Chinese have been using chopsticks for thousands of years. Unfortunately,
most visitors to China haven’t had quite so much practice. Although using
chopsticks isn’t a requirement while eating in China, the Chinese people
admire your attempts to do so. If you really can’t use chopsticks, your host
can arrange for you to have a fork and knife, but at least make an effort
before giving up.
Consider making a visit to a local Chinese restaurant to practice using chop-
sticks before you arrive in China.
Figuring out how to eat with chopsticks is pretty easy. The key is to hold chop-
sticks the right way. Chopsticks are usually thinner at the bottom than they
are at the top. Hold your chopsticks near the top and place them between
your thumb and your forefinger. Now keep the bottom chopstick in a fixed
position while using your forefinger to move the top chopstick to grab the
food (see Figure 16-2). With a little practice, you can be an expert in no time.
301
Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette

At an important dinner meeting with your largest buyer back home, you
wouldn’t be tapping your soup spoon on the table in front of your guests,
now would you? Table manners in China are important, too. So here are a few
rules for using chopsticks the right way:
 Never point your chopsticks at someone.
 Never use chopsticks for anything but eating your food. They’re not to
be used like drumsticks!
 Don’t stick your chopsticks into the food. In other words, don’t spear
your food like you’re harpooning a whale. Never stick and leave your
chopsticks in your rice bowl — it looks too much like the sticks of
incense used in Chinese funerals. Such a move indicates death!
 Don’t wave your chopsticks around while talking.
 Don’t serve others with your chopsticks. Separate chopsticks just for
serving others should be available.
 If you’re finished using your chopsticks, place them on the chopsticks
holder or on the edge of your plate. Never place chopsticks on the table
except on a chopsticks holder.
 Try not to drop your chopsticks on the ground — it’s considered bad
luck. If you do, summon your server for a fresh pair.
Drinking at the banquet
Drinking alcohol plays a major role in a Chinese banquet. It seems to lower bar-
riers between cultures, which can make conversation interesting. Drinking with
the Chinese can certainly help build your relationship and trust with them.

Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

The servers keep your glass of beer, wine, or Chinese liquor full during the
meal. Plenty of toasting happens at the table, so the servers constantly refill
your glass. Just sip your beer or wine so you don’t drink too much.
Among the Chinese, the host tends to lose face if he or she drinks but the
guest of honor doesn’t. For Westerners, this situation isn’t necessarily so, but
it’s best to at least drink a little if your host does. Just hope that your Chinese
host isn’t a big drinker so you don’t have to keep up.
Sometimes, the Chinese may not be drinking what you think they’re drinking.
Occasionally, the Chinese people you’re dining with may substitute some-
thing other than alcohol in their glasses. On rare occasions, you may even
see the Chinese pour the liquor out of the glass before they drink. (Don’t
even think about doing this in return!) These tactics limit the alcohol con-
sumed by the Chinese, but not your consumption.
Selecting what to drink
Usually, beer or wine and perhaps a Chinese liquor are offered. In addition to
tea, soft drinks and water are also available. You may even see the Chinese
mix wine with 7-Up. No cocktails are available at Chinese banquets, though.
Usually, Chinese hosts serve some of China’s favorite beers. Foreign brands
are becoming common, too.
Your Chinese hosts generally offer a strong, clear Chinese liquor served in a
short glass to be used for toasting. In Chinese, it’s called baijiu (buy-geo). The
most common Chinese brand of baijiu consumed at banquets is Mao Tai, a
liquor made from sorghum.
A strong liquor such as Mao Tai can be over 100 proof (50 percent alcohol).
Be sure to drink it in moderation if at all. You can substitute beer or wine if
you don’t like the taste.
When dining in southern China, tap your fingers lightly a couple times on the
table with your middle finger after someone fills up your drink glass or tea cup.
Watching how much you drink
The Chinese like to see foreign guests get a little tipsy at banquets, so feel
free to let down your guard a bit and have a few laughs with your Chinese
friends. However, make sure you don’t drink too much. You don’t want to
embarrass your company. You’ll also need to be sharp for the morning meet-
ings the Chinese usually arrange.
If you don’t drink alcohol, be sure to tell your host early. Your host may still
attempt to get you to drink, but he or she will soon understand that you’re
really not interested. As an alternative, you can choose to drink tea or a soft
drink. You can still participate in toasting even though you’re not drinking
alcohol.

Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette

Toasting at banquets
Toasting at a Chinese banquet is critically important. It starts at the begin-
ning of the meal and continues throughout. The host is the first one to make
a toast to the visitors. As a guest, you’re expected to make a toast in return,
soon after the host toasts you for the first time. Failing to make toasts during
the banquet doesn’t leave a good impression with the Chinese.
The host holds a glass in front of him or her, one hand holding the glass and
the other hand with the extended forefinger under the base of the glass.
When people make a toast in China, they generally don’t raise their glasses
very high but keep the glasses lowered. When you’re at a Chinese banquet,
don’t clink your glass during the toast. Just raise your glass to make a toast.
You can toast with any type of beverage, but it’s common to toast with what
your host is drinking. The host often says gan bei (gan bay), which literally
means dry glass. You’re expected to drink the entire amount that’s in your glass.
Make a toast to the group or individuals. At large-scale banquets, the host often
visits each table and makes an appropriate toast along the way. You can make
toasts just about any time during the banquet, but be sure to let the Chinese do
so first. A good time to toast is in between courses. Don’t toast when the meal
is winding down during dessert — unless the host is still going strong!
Keep your toasts short — don’t give a speech. Keep it to somewhere between
10 to 20 seconds. Here are some good subjects that you can refer to during
your toasting:
 Friendship
 Future success
 Good fortune
 Good health
 Mutual cooperation
 Prosperity
 Thank you to the host
Understanding Chinese banquet behavior
To be a polite guest at the banquet, knowing how people behave at the ban-
quet table can really help. To avoid any surprises on your side, here’s a quick
list of some things you should expect:
304
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

 Talking while eating food: Your hosts may continue to talk while they’re
eating. Don’t be offended and go with the flow.
 Getting red-faced: Some of your Chinese friends may get a bit red-faced
after a few rounds of toasting at the table. This flushing isn’t necessarily
because they’re drunk — it’s a somewhat common feature among Asians to
redden without actually getting drunk. Someone on the Chinese side may
poke some fun at a colleague’s glowing red face, but you don’t want to risk
embarrassing your Chinese contacts, so don’t say anything yourself.
 Belching and slurping at the table: Don’t be surprised if your Chinese
hosts make belching or slurping sounds during the banquet. It’s just a way
for them to express how much they’re enjoying the food and the company.
 Nodding heads: The Chinese nod their heads to you during the meal or
around the banquet table and flash a smile at the same time. This is just
a polite way to check in with you during the course of the banquet to
make sure you’re enjoying yourself. Nod and smile back. This gesture
helps break down language barriers.
 Eating meat off the bone: Using chopsticks to eat meat off the bone is a
challenge for visitors. It takes a little practice, but you can do it. Using
your fingers to grab the meat off the bone isn’t polite (though it’s
becoming increasingly common at less-formal banquets). Instead, break
the meat off the bone using your chopsticks, or if you’re more skilled
with using chopsticks, bring the piece to your mouth using your chop-
sticks and eat it off the bone.
 Dealing with fish parts: Swallowing fish bones can be dangerous, so be
careful when the fish is served whole. Try to select a serving that contains
fewer bones than another. Choose the easiest piece of food on the platter.
Try removing as many bones as you can while your serving is on your
plate before you begin to eat it. People commonly put their fish serving
in their mouths — bones and all. The Chinese remove the bones from
their mouths using chopsticks, but if a napkin’s handy, you can use it to
remove the bones from your mouth. Leave the bones on your plate,
which servers remove before the next course.
The Chinese eat most of the fish on the platter. If you receive any parts
of the fish that don’t seem appealing to you, simply leave the serving on
your plate.
 Picking your teeth: Cleaning your teeth using a toothpick during the
meal is customary. The Chinese hide their mouth behind a hand while
working a toothpick with the other hand. If you choose to use a tooth-
pick, you should do likewise. If the toothpicks are individually wrapped
in paper, you know that someone hasn’t touched them already.
305
Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette

 Handling slippery noodles: As if using chopsticks weren’t tricky
enough, how do you get 12-inch-long slippery noodles into your mouth?
The best way to deal with noodles is to have the server cut the noodles
into a manageable length. Your host can arrange this for you.
Alternatively, get the noodles into a bowl, raise the bowl closer to your
mouth, and scoop the noodles into your mouth using the chopsticks.
Don’t worry if you make a slurping noise. This method is a lot easier, and
it keeps your laundry bill to a minimum!
 Using the rice bowl: Getting those small grains of rice to your mouth
using chopsticks can be a challenge. When in China, do as the Chinese
do: The secret is to raise your bowl near your mouth using one hand and
to scoop the rice into your mouth using your chopsticks with the other
hand (see Figure 16-3).
Returning the favor: Hosting a banquet
Hosting a return banquet for the Chinese is customary. Just follow how the
Chinese hosted the opening banquet and play the role of host to your hon-
ored Chinese guests. Be sure to get the seating arrangements right, too.
Hosting a return banquet gives you yet another opportunity to get to know
your Chinese business contacts. For the most part, the same people who
entertained you will also be at the banquet you host. Therefore, you already
know the ranking of the guests and can put them in the appropriate places
around the table. If you’re having trouble with the seating arrangements, your
interpreter may be able to guide you.

Choosing a quality restaurant for the banquet is important. After all, your
company is hosting. If you don’t have any contacts in China who may know a
reputable restaurant, you can always ask your Chinese host for a recommen-
dation. Make sure that the restaurant is conveniently located and not too far
away for everybody to get to.
After you’ve determined the place, make a reservation as soon as you can after
arrival. Usually, you hold the return banquet the night before your departure
back home. If you don’t have an interpreter with you, your hotel can make a
reservation for you. Make the reservation under your company name and tell
them how many people you have and whether you want a private room.
Plan on providing an appropriate menu — don’t make your Chinese friends
lose face by providing a more elaborate banquet than the one they hosted for
you. Arranging the menu can be a bit tricky for rookies, so you may want to
rely on someone locally to help you choose an appropriate menu and price
that suits your budget. You should know that Chinese banquets are generally
fairly expensive. When you host a Chinese banquet, someone from your
group should be at the restaurant about 30 minutes before the start. That
way, you can ensure that seating arrangements are organized, check that the
menu is correct, and determine what drinks will be served.
As the delicious food comes to an end, so does the banquet. When every-
one’s finished with the meal, the banquet is over. This is an ideal time for
you, as the host, to provide the Chinese with a gift. (We discuss gift giving in
China in the next section.) Shortly after receiving their gifts, the Chinese will
be on their way. The last thing left is for you to pay the bill.
Tokens of Appreciation: 
Giving Gifts Correctly
Gift giving is a common practice in China. It’s a good way of thanking some-
one for doing a special favor or celebrating a special occasion, or it may just
be a way to cement your relationship with a business contact. Done the right
way, exchanging gifts can help build a stronger relationship with the Chinese.
You can give a single gift to the Chinese company or give individual gifts to
the Chinese people you’re working with. Giving individual gifts is great
because it lets everybody participate in the gift-giving ritual. If you give a
single gift to the company, the recipient should be obvious to everyone. For
example, you can give them a crystal decorative piece representing a signifi-
cant landmark from your home city — Big Ben, Sears Tower, Sydney Harbor
Bridge. Read on for details on the rites and rituals of gift giving.
307
Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette

Deciding how much to spend
Don’t choose gifts that are too expensive. You and your company don’t want
to be seen to be buying favors or business in China. Also, an expensive gift
may invite the Chinese to give you a more expensive gift at a later time,
which you may then need to one-up, and so on.
Check with your home country laws or company policies about monetary
limits for gift giving before you decide what to do about gift giving in China.
Some companies have strict rules about giving and receiving gifts.
On the other hand, you don’t want to buy cheap gifts for your Chinese 
business contacts. Doing so reflects poorly on you and your company 
and is likely to insult the people you’re trying to get to know better. Giving 
a modestly priced (US$5 to US$20) gift of good quality is something the
Chinese can certainly appreciate. The gifts should be of the same value 
to everyone — don’t give the Chinese leader a separate gift.
Choosing an appropriate gift
Be sure that your gifts weren’t made in China (or other Chinese places such as
Hong Kong or Taiwan). Providing a gift that’s made in your home country and
has some significance to your local city or area is best. You can even consider
gifts that include your company’s logo on it. Bring along extra gifts — perhaps
even a dozen — just in case you meet more people than you expect during
your visit. Popular gifts to give to your Chinese contacts include the following:
 Calculators
 Paperweights
 Pens (but avoid red ink, which symbolizes severing ties)
 Liquor, especially brandy (as a company gift)
Here are some gifts that aren’t appropriate. Some of these gifts have supersti-
tions around them or just aren’t good to give:
 Clocks
 Food
 Hats
308
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

 Handkerchiefs
 Money
 Umbrellas
You can expect to receive gifts from the Chinese as well. They may include
things such as scrolls, prints, calligraphy, and other gifts representing
Chinese culture.
Paying attention to presentation
The color of the gift wrapping matters in China. To play it safe, use red wrap-
ping paper. The color red is considered lucky in Chinese culture. Hopefully,
some of it’ll rub off on you! Yellow and pink work well, too. Stay away from
blue, white, and black, and don’t include a card or use any ribbon.
Also, you may want to consider the significance of the number of gifts you
give. Eight is very lucky, and four is associated with death.
Hold off on the gift wrapping until after you reach China — the customs 
officials may need to inspect your gifts upon arrival.
Exchanging gifts
Exchanging gifts usually takes place after you’ve concluded your business
dealings — usually at the end of the last banquet or at the end of the final
meeting with your Chinese contacts before your departure. Never give gifts
to the Chinese when you first meet them.
Having the most senior person from your firm present the gift is a courtesy.
Give the gift with two hands to the most senior Chinese person and then to
the remaining members of the Chinese delegation. Don’t be surprised if the
Chinese bow slightly as they receive your gift as a gesture of thanks.
If the Chinese visit your company’s office in your home country, presenting 
a gift to them at the end of their visit with you is polite. If the gift, such as a
crystal replica of the Empire State Building, is too bulky to fit in a suitcase,
offer to ship it back to China as a courtesy.
309
Chapter 16: Saying and Doing the Right Things: Chinese Business Etiquette

Always first present the gift in person. Never send a gift to the Chinese.
The Chinese have been known to refuse gifts once, twice, or even three times
before accepting a gift. Be persistent, and they’ll accept your gift. (Younger
Chinese may show more willingness to accept gifts.) Make sure you express
your thanks when you receive and accept your gift from the Chinese. Just say
that you’re most thankful for their generosity and that the gift was certainly
not necessary. There’s no need to send a thank-you note.
In China, opening the gift in front of the person who gave it to you is impolite,
so don’t expect your Chinese friends to open your gift in front of you. You
should do the same — open the gift later on.

Managing Risks in China
In This Chapter
 Setting up financial controls
 Managing legal risks and resolving disputes
 Protecting intellectual property
 Watching out for environmental liabilities
 Insuring against risks
T
he best way to deal with risk is to hire experienced professionals to help
implement control programs. Although good help costs money, this chap-
ter should clarify the trade-off between spending a little money now and pos-
sibly spending big money later. The first step to good risk management is
taking a good look at what you’re getting yourself into.
We could write volumes on managing in China, but that’s beyond the scope of
this book. This chapter gives you the big picture of the risks foreign businesses
commonly face. It also gives you some simple strategies to lessen those risks.
We cover major areas of risk and talk about insurance options and strategies.
Doing Due Diligence
The best way to manage risk is to avoid it! Basically, look before you leap and
carry out due diligence (DD) whenever possible. Basically, due diligence means
investigating potential aspects of your business, such as partners or assets
you’re acquiring. How far you go with DD depends on your particular situation.
You have to balance the costs and time, along with how much cooperation you
can get from the other side, against the potential risks of the transaction.
Liability can come out of the woodwork in China. Consult with professionals
experienced in China in the various DD areas to understand your risks before
making any decisions on DD.

The basics: Reviewing the business license
When dealing with another company, look at its business license. The busi-
ness license is a document that all companies in China must obtain from the
Administration for Industry and Commerce (AIC — see Chapter 7).
You can either ask the company to provide its license or hire a lawyer to
check at the AIC in the city where the company is registered. If a lawyer car-
ries out the check at the AIC, he or she can do so without the company’s
knowledge. The business license reveals several basic pieces of information
about the company:
 Validity: Find out at a minimum whether the company you’re dealing
with is validly established and exists.
 Business scope: Check the company’s business scope to see whether 
it’s operating within it. A company that operates outside of its business
scope risks shutdown. (Chapter 7 can fill you in on scope.)
 Signatory authorizations: Find out who’s authorized to sign contracts
on the other company’s behalf.
When signing a contract, the other side’s authorized signatory ideally
executes it. However, if the person who’s going to execute the contract
isn’t an authorized signatory, you want him or her to either bring along a
duly executed power of attorney (that you’ll keep a copy of) and/or have
the company chop (stamp) the contract. (A chop is an official company
seal that must be manufactured by a licensed chop producer. For more
on chops, see Chapter 7.) Of course, having both the power of attorney
and the chop is better than having just one of the two.
 Ownership: The business license tells you who the owners are. You may
find that the legal owners aren’t who you thought they were. In such
cases, you need to consult with your lawyers to determine whether this
situation can have a material effect on your transaction.
 Capitalization: You also see the company’s registered capital, which is
important for figuring out how well capitalized the company is in case
something goes wrong.
If you don’t think the other side’s finances are strong enough to protect
you in the event of a problem, you may be able to get the owner(s) of a
private company to guarantee potential liabilities. This technique isn’t
foolproof, but it may provide more comfort.
Practicing DD for joint ventures
When you’re looking at setting up a joint venture (JV), the DD should be espe-
cially thorough. Usually, the Chinese partner contributes assets and/or workers
312
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

to the JV. You need to have financial professionals confirm that the assets are
worth what the partner claims they are (trying to overvalue their capital contri-
butions isn’t uncommon). Technical people should assess the assets to see
whether they’re in good working order and can do what they’re supposed to do.
The legal team should check the titles to the assets and see whether any liens
against them exist. Assets are sometimes titled to entities or persons other
than the JV partner. If the partner is contributing workers, the legal team
should also assess whether there are any potential liabilities from unpaid
social benefits, improperly terminated labor contracts, and so on.
Doing DD for hiring individuals
How little investigation many foreign investors carry out on people they hire
or consider working with is surprising. Rogue general managers (GM) are a
real problem in China. Although only a small percentage of GMs are rogues,
they cost their employers enormous sums of money by lining their own pock-
ets and damaging the company’s operations.
Identifying a rogue isn’t as easy as you may think — many of them are able to
go from one company to the next without anybody being the wiser until the
stuff hits the fan. Rogues can be Chinese or expatriate — nationality doesn’t
make a difference. When most rogue GMs get caught, they’re able to negoti-
ate a glowing reference letter in return for not doing further damage to the
company. Make sure you thoroughly check out your GM and other key poten-
tial hires (such as financial controllers) before making a hiring decision. You
should at least call their references and previous employers.
If you really want to cover your bases, some firms specialize in conducting
background investigations. Among the firms offering this type of service are
large Western companies, such as Kroll (www.kroll.com).
Controlling Financial Risks
Managing your financial risks involves keeping on top of things such as use 
of your company’s resources and expenses. Unfortunately, many foreign
investors don’t think about thorough financial controls until something goes
wrong. Implementing comprehensive controls at the beginning is a good idea
for at least two reasons:
 You don’t want your company to get ripped off.
 Having good financial controls in place can help you get good informa-
tion for your management.
313
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China

If you’re always aware of how much your company’s spending for what, spot-
ting trends and problems early on is easier.
To help you understand why and where you need controls in China, we dis-
cuss the big picture of Chinese accounting as well as some of the problems to
be on the lookout for.
Counting beans differently
China is in the process of adopting modern accounting methods and stan-
dards, but it’ll take a while before it catches on. Right now, China is playing
catch-up. China didn’t even introduce a double-entry bookkeeping system
until the mid-1990s.
Western systems focus on facilitating management’s internal control, so they
have numerous income statement accounts. Usually, Western controllers
have to thoroughly understand the business and its processes in order to do
their jobs.
However, Chinese accounting has historically focused on the balance sheet
because the government looks to exert control on businesses through
accounting (for example, through capital accounts — see Chapter 10). A
result of the system in China is that Chinese accountants have traditionally
concentrated on complying with tax requirements, particularly value-added
tax (see Chapter 10). They’re not used to accounting in a way that reflects
economic reality for managers. Compounding that problem is the fact that
interacting with the rest of the business isn’t customary for accountants and
controllers in Chinese companies. Without properly training your accounting
staff and implementing good controls, you’re quite likely to get internal
reports that don’t reflect your company’s actual performance.
China did just enact new laws that bring Chinese accounting standards
mostly in line with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); how-
ever, because IFRS is so new in China, finding accountants in China who
understand the new standards is very difficult.
Balancing an out-of-balance sheet
Too often in Chinese accounting, a number of items get stuck in the balance
sheet. For example, obsolete tooling often sits on balance sheets as an asset
instead of being depreciated or written off through the income statement.
Also, the concept of warranty reserves is literally foreign in China. In Chinese
companies (and FIEs without good controls), overstating assets and under-
stating expenses is therefore very common.
314
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Your company should install a decent accounting system. Training accounting
people to make basic use of an accounting system isn’t difficult, because the
application should handle all the heavy lifting. The hard part is training the
accountants to make much more descriptive entries than they’re used to. In
other words, they should enter “five laser toner cartridges” instead of “office
expense.” Although this idea may seem common sense to many Westerners, 
it isn’t in China. Generally, in Chinese companies, you’d have to look through
physical receipts to figure out that your company bought five toner cartridges.
Jay Boyle is the managing partner of Expat-CFO Services Ltd. (www.expat-
cfo.com), a company that designs financial controls for clients, performs out-
sourced accounting work, and conducts financial due diligence. Boyle advises
his clients to perform a balance sheet cleanup each year in the fourth quarter.
He says that even FIEs with a Western controller and well-trained accountants
will inevitably find items stuck on the balance sheet that shouldn’t be there.
Exposing shadow businesses
Every company has to deal with unscrupulous employees at some time or
another. In China, most FIEs don’t have problems with outright embezzle-
ment. Instead, employees more commonly use company assets to line their
own pockets.
One foreign businessperson tells the story of a friend who’d recently arrived
in China to manage his company’s operations there. One day, the new man-
ager exclaimed, “My new secretary is great. She just started, and she’s already
figured out how to save us 45 percent on our office supplies.” Immediately
after blurting out that statement, the manager realized the likely truth: The
last person was overpaying by 45 percent and receiving a kickback.
Employees may use company cars and trucks to run their own side businesses
ferrying people or goods. Or they may run repair shops using parts from the
company’s inventory. Every now and then, you hear about something a little
more bizarre, such as company cafeteria workers’ stealing food to sell to nearby
restaurants. It’s usually the type of thing you wouldn’t worry about in the West.
All this theft can easily add up. Sometimes, it can cause extremely serious
damage to your company — workers occasionally steal product tags or
labels to sell to counterfeiters.
Practicing common-sense controls
Developing controls to cover all your bases is fairly difficult. After all, you
have to think about the worst-case scenarios possible in each area of your
business. Firms that have experience in designing financial controls in China
(such as Expat CFO, www.expat-cfo.com) can add a lot of value.
315
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China

Here are some good, common-sense measures of prevention:
 Installing GPS devices on trucks
 Checking mileage on cars
 Double-checking supply prices on global online marketplaces 
such as Alibaba (www.alibaba.com) or Global Sources (www.
globalsources.com)
 Establishing clear guidelines for expense reports and budgets
 Centralizing travel arrangements
 Requiring employees to turn in their boarding pass stubs when 
seeking reimbursement
Supporting controls through 
company culture
Financial controls are only as good as the people who implement them. 
Many Chinese employees aren’t used to working in companies that place 
so much emphasis on accurate reporting and separation of company and 
personal assets.
Don’t let your employees feel that the controls are merely onerous require-
ments imposed on them. Workers need to understand the benefits of a com-
pany that operates on the up-and-up and gives managers good information.
This education is really an issue of creating the right corporate culture.
We highly recommend that a new FIE begin with a controller who has worked
for his or her company for a long time. That way, the controller really under-
stands the culture and can bring it to China. If you go with a controller who’s
relatively new, send human resources out to China for a while to create the
culture. This move can improve all aspects of your business, not just controls.
Limiting Your Legal Risks
Legal risk is a pretty broad category in China, as it is anywhere. It can encom-
pass everything from noncompliance with the law to losing control of your
company or assets.
Chinese laws are often fairly vague and broadly worded. They can seem more
like statements of principles than anything else. Lawyers in China are particu-
larly fond of saying that the devil’s in the details. That’s because you often
can’t see the real impact of a law until implementing rules and interpretations
come out.
316
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Thinking locally
You may frequently encounter situations in which local officials have a good
deal of latitude in how to interpret the law. The different priorities and goals
of different areas can affect how officials interpret laws. Officials’ sophistica-
tion varies, too. Some areas have well-educated officials who deal with for-
eign investors all the time. Other places may have officials for whom your
business venture is a completely new concept.
Making matters worse is that an official can sometimes tell you that your appli-
cation is fine, but when you go for approval, you’re rejected. That rejection isn’t
out of bad faith. It’s just that the official you’re speaking with doesn’t know how
his superiors will come out on something. Unfortunately, asking such an official
whether the boss agrees with his or her interpretation would be rude. For this
reason, you’re rarely going to get an official to give you a written interpretation.
Much of the variation depends on location, so you can limit your risk by set-
ting up in places used to dealing with foreign investors. If you’re setting up in
places like Shanghai, which has thousands of foreign investors, you’re going
to get a process that’s more consistent. However, Shanghai isn’t going to go
out of its way to get your investment, so you have to balance the eagerness of
the local government against its experience with foreign investment. (By the
way, don’t assume that just because one bureau is really interested in attract-
ing your company, the approval agencies will fall in line. They may or may
not. For more on government relations, see Chapter 8.)
317
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China
Minimum suggestions: We know 
what the law says, but . . .
According to Winston Zhao, the partner in
charge of Jones Day’s Shanghai office, one of
the most frustrating parts of doing business in
China is how unpredictable the legal environ-
ment can be. And by “legal environment,” he
doesn’t just mean the laws; although laws and
regulations themselves lead to unintended con-
sequences, the more common issue is in imple-
mentation of laws and regulations.
Zhao tells a story from the early 1990s that illus-
trates how officials’ varying priorities can affect
their interpretations of the law. At the time, Zhao
was assisting a client in setting up a pharma-
ceutical company in a southern Chinese city.
After reviewing the application, some officials
called Zhao to tell him that the social benefits
the client projected paying were too low. Zhao
double-checked the figures and confirmed that
they complied with the amount set by law.
When Zhao made this point to the officials, they
responded that they view the law as only estab-
lishing the minimum level. After some discus-
sion, the officials made it clear that the client
faced a choice: Either pay a higher level of ben-
efits or go elsewhere. (Incidentally, the client
chose to pay the greater benefits.)

Implementing corporate governance
Corporate governance, or ensuring that company managers have the com-
pany’s interests at heart, has been a hot topic in the West for the better part
of a decade now, and the term may seem overused. As important as good
governance is in your home market, it’s critical when headquarters is thou-
sands of miles away from the operation.
What can go wrong if you have weak governance? In a word, everything.
Money and property can be siphoned off; the FIE can be violating labor, envi-
ronmental, or numerous other laws; or the China branch can be competing
with headquarters for customers. This section gives some tips for beefing up
your corporate governance.
Wholly foreign-owned enterprises (WFOEs) may have even more problems
with compliance and embezzlement than JVs do. In JVs, the mutual feeling of
slight distrust between the partners acts as somewhat of a restraint. In many
poorly supervised WFOEs, the management (usually the general manager)
has virtually unfettered power because nobody else is minding the store.
Putting a strong finance person in place
Your general manager (GM) and controller have to work well together. (But
you don’t want them to work too well with each other, either — see the
“Taboo relations” sidebar.) Ideally, both come from your home operations,
and you know them well.
To ensure proper checks and balances, the finance person, not the GM,
should keep the official company seals (the chops). See Chapter 7 for details
on chops.
318
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 
Taboo relations
Even a good corporate governance system can
become corrupted by unforeseeable events, so
do frequent inspections and audits. One of the
worst corporate governance situations we’re
aware of involved a Western wholly foreign-
owned enterprise with an expatriate GM. The
GM was married with a wife and kids who
moved out to China with him, and he lived in a
cozy expat compound. The GM began having
“relations” with not one, but two — yes, two —
female subordinates. One of the subordinates
happened to be the financial controller. After a
while, the controller realized that she could
steal from the company without worry because
the only person who could catch her was the
GM. So the GM stood by and watched her rip off
the company, knowing that if he did something
about it, his career and marriage would be over.
Eventually, he found another job.

Having an adequately involved board
An active board should do the following:
 Hold regular meetings. Most FIE boards in China meet only once per
year, which is too seldom. FIE boards should receive and review regular
written reports from the general manager (GM).
 Separate management from the board. Especially make sure that a
manager doesn’t serve as chairman of the board. The chairman’s role is
important in certain crisis situations because some documents require
his or her signature. Because bad management usually precipitates such
crises, having a manager/chairman can make matters worse.
 Enact a clear set of management bylaws that the GM and all managers
must abide by. These bylaws should specify what decisions each man-
ager may make unilaterally, which ones require joint management
actions, and which ones require board approval. Having various manage-
ment controls in the bylaws rather than in the Articles of Association
(AOA) is preferable because changes to the AOA require official approval.
As we discuss in Chapter 5, the minority shareholder in JVs must have at least
one board seat. In addition, JV decisions are all made at the board (rather
than shareholder) level. By law, certain board decisions must be unanimous.
Limiting the powers of the general manager and chairman
Place limits on the GM and the chairman of the board. Your China operation
should have management bylaws that limit the GM’s power. For instance, you
may make a provision that the GM can’t make certain decisions without
board approval. This idea is even more important in JVs because Chinese JV
structures typically make the GM the sole decision maker in the organization.
By law, the chairman of the board is the legal representative of the company.
Although chairman is rarely a full-time position, the authorities give a lot of
deference to the chairman. The chairman is responsible for signing the min-
utes of board meetings and various important documents. When negotiating
JV terms, don’t be too quick to cede the ability to appoint the chairman.
In JVs, having controls on the chairman’s powers is important if your partner
appoints the chairman. You may want to give another board member the abil-
ity to convene board meetings if the chairman can’t do so. More to the point,
though, the JV contract should restrict the chairman’s ability to act without
written board authorization. Failure to get authorization should result in the
chairman’s removal and the chairman being personally liable for his or her
actions.
Trusting — but not too much
Headquarters should send somebody senior to check out the China opera-
tions regularly — at least once each quarter. This person should be able to
spend significant time in the office and factory on his or her trips.
319
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China

One of this representative’s goals should be to develop relationships with
employees other than senior managers. Employees can then feel that they
have a contact at headquarters in case they want to report something. This
person should also monitor whether the corporate culture has taken hold. If
not, he or she should work with the management to instill it.
If the China side seems to be scheduling an inordinate amount of time out of
the office for visitors from headquarters, they may be covering something up.
Conduct legal audits every so often — particularly if you smell something
fishy. In such an audit, you engage outside counsel, which works in conjunc-
tion with your in-house counsel (if any). The auditors sift through reams of
contracts and other documents, looking to see whether the company has
undertaken any transactions that don’t comply with procedures.
Combating Corruption
Corruption isn’t nearly as pervasive in China as many in the West portray it
to be. However, as in any other country, it does exist. The Chinese govern-
ment even recognizes this fact. As in many countries in the world, it’s been
going on for a long time.
The good news is that China’s leaders are working hard to decrease the amount
of bad stuff that happens around shady business dealings by dismissing even
high-ranking officials suspected of behaving inappropriately. Unfortunately,
there’s a lot more work to be done.
No matter how your competitors act or how disadvantaged you feel, make sure
you play by the rules. Keep in mind that in addition to breaking Chinese law,
you may be breaking your home country’s laws any time you get caught up in
corrupt practices. In this section, we discuss bribery and how to avoid it.
Understanding bribery laws
For most people, there’s no safe haven for violating another country’s anti-
corruption laws. The U.S., for instance, enacted the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA), which applies to U.S. persons and companies as well as those
doing business in the U.S. If you’re not based in the U.S., your home country
probably has a similar law. The gist of the FCPA is that if your company (or
you as an individual) attempts — even unsuccessfully — to bribe an official
of another country, you can face significant fines and/or jail time.
The FCPA and similar laws impose a duty to perform due diligence on third
(nongovernmental) parties to ensure that they’re not engaged in corruption,
either. In other words, if your partner is making payments that you’re
320
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

unaware of, you may be in violation of the law if you didn’t make an effort to
know about your partner’s business practices. You also can’t get cute and try
to “pay” a consultant who’s then going to bribe somebody on your behalf.
The FCPA is concerned with acts that are illegal according to the particular
foreign country’s written laws. If a law isn’t enforced in that country, it doesn’t
matter — whatever’s on the books constitutes a violation of the FCPA.
Keeping government relationships straight
The idea that you can’t bribe officials sounds like common sense. But what
about special treatment, dinners, gifts, or other things that you may not intend
as a bribe but can be viewed as one? And what about employees who are
Communist Party members who have relatives who are “officials”? As you can
see, China has some special characteristics that make keeping clear on what
may or may not be a bribe — and who all the players are — a little harder.
For one thing, your company may be dealing with companies that are par-
tially or wholly state owned. That setup can make employees of those compa-
nies “government officials” for purposes of the FCPA and similar laws (see the
preceding section for info on law). Also, officials often have family members
in business. Regulators may consider these businesspeople to be officials.
Under a very broad (but not implausible) interpretation, anybody who’s a
member of the Communist Party may be considered an official — and there
are millions of them.
As soon as you’re dealing with an “official,” any kickback or other improper
benefit would violate the law. But more subtle items, such as entertainment
or paying for a business trip for these people, can also run afoul of the law.
Be aware of the risk of giving such items. (For advice on giving gifts to your
business partners, see Chapter 16.)
Training for compliance
The most important part of a compliance program is educating all employ-
ees. Chinese staff should receive Chinese language instruction. If you have
people who’re experienced working in your home operation involved in
China, they can set a cultural tone of compliance and ethics.
Beyond education, you should have monitoring systems in place. Make sure
that money is properly accounted for. Official receipts in China (called fa
piao) often aren’t very descriptive of the services or products received.
When dealing with consultants or agents, seek to get details on what they
spent your money on. You can also perform background checks on suppliers
and consultants to ensure that they’re operating on the up and up.
321
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China

If your company’s China operation runs afoul of the FCPA or similar laws, reg-
ulators usually take into consideration how much effort your company made
to prevent and monitor violations.
Managing donations responsibly
Being a solid corporate citizen in China may entail making donations or
grants to the local community. Make sure that all the employees involved in
making donations understand FCPA issues.
In many cases, your company donates to a government-run organization. Make
sure you give no appearance of quid pro quo in making such a donation (for
example, help our hospital, and your company will get a government contract).
If you’re making a good-sized donation, have the recipient sign a donation
agreement. The donation agreement should be very specific as to the permit-
ted uses of the donation. It should also require that the recipient submit
detailed records of expenditures to your company and give your company
the right to inspect and audit.
Resolving Disputes through Arbitration
You’ve probably heard that enforcing contracts in China is difficult.
Westerners have the perception that the Chinese courts are protectionist and
unsophisticated. True? It really depends on where you’re going to court. The
court system is getting better, but a number of smaller cities’ courts have
judges who are ex-army officers with little or no legal training. Therefore, 
you can be taking your chances in court. So are contracts unenforceable as 
a practical matter? Nope!
Almost every contract you enter into in China or with a Chinese company
should select binding arbitration for dispute resolution. Arbitration is like 
a private court system. A tribunal of arbitrators — almost always licensed
attorneys — hears cases. Typically, arbitration is faster and less expensive
than litigation. This section explains the arbitration process.
Understanding arbitration clauses
To select binding arbitration, include a binding arbitration clause in the govern-
ing contract. At a minimum, an arbitration clause should specify the following:
322
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

 Arbitration body (see the next section)
 Place of arbitration
 Arbitration language
 That the arbitration is binding
 The number of tribunal members and the selection process
 Procedural rules
 That the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction
 Governing law of the contract, which we discuss later in “The rulebook:
Determining governing law” (this point doesn’t have to be in the arbitra-
tion clause itself but often is)
If you go to the Web sites of various arbitration tribunals, they often have
model arbitration clauses. You should always consult with a lawyer before
dropping one of those clauses into your contract, though. You usually want
to make sure you have some control over the arbitrator selection process or
at least state that the parties must mutually agree to the arbitrators. You can
specify the selection process in the arbitration agreement. (For small dis-
putes, the arbitration procedures are somewhat different. Make sure your
clause reflects the proper procedures.)
In a couple of well-known cases, the Chinese courts took a very formalistic
approach to whether an arbitration clause was valid, ruling that they were
invalid because of such technicalities as a slight error in the name of the arbi-
tration body. Ask your attorney whether his or her arbitration clauses have
previously been enforced.
If you and the other party have a series of contracts (either directly or through
affiliated companies, such as parents or subsidiaries), make sure the arbitra-
tion clauses in all the contracts are substantially the same. A given issue can
directly or indirectly involve more than one contract. If different contracts
mention different forums, then where to arbitrate the issue may be unclear.
Surveying arbitration bodies
China has a number of arbitration bodies. The oldest is the China
International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC, www.
cietac.org.cn/index_english.asp). CIETAC and many of these other
arbitration bodies are generally considered to be impartial and competent. In
fact, CIETAC is the world’s busiest arbitration body. Opting for arbitration at
the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC, www.hkiac.org) or
the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is also common.
323
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China

Chinese companies used to be more willing to go to Hong Kong, Singapore, or
elsewhere for arbitration. Although agreeing to foreign arbitration still hap-
pens, Chinese companies often prefer not to leave China — particularly for
smaller matters. That’s usually fine, though, because CIETAC and many other
Chinese arbitration bodies are good forums.
Assuming you choose a decent arbitration panel, electing arbitration should
ensure that you have an impartial and competent body hearing the dispute. It
should also mean that the process is transparent and easier than litigation.
The rulebook: Determining governing law
An arbitration clause isn’t worth much unless you choose a governing law for
the underlying agreement. In certain situations, contracts must be governed
by Chinese law. However, in many circumstances, the parties can opt for any
other governing law.
Failing to choose a governing law is a bad idea. Even if the Chinese courts
accept that Chinese law prevails, courts in another country that may be
involved in the contract (that is, the country of incorporation for one of the
parties) may also think that their law applies. All parties can waste a lot of
time and money figuring out which law applies. Chinese law isn’t the default.
Decide on the governing law at the outset, which can affect how the contract
is drafted. The governing law decision should also be tied to the arbitration
forum. Try to get a sense of whether the forum you’re choosing has a good
selection of arbitrators who’re familiar with the governing law. For example,
finding arbitrators in China who’re familiar with Hong Kong or New York law
usually isn’t too hard. But finding arbitrators familiar with Polish law can be 
a challenge.
Enforcing the rulings
Say you win your arbitration, and the tribunal has issued an award in your
favor for US$1 million. Assuming that the counterparty didn’t bring its check-
book to the arbitration and hasn’t exactly invited you over to collect, what do
you do?
The collection process is basically the same in almost any country: You go to
a court that has jurisdiction over the defendant (usually a court where the
company is headquartered or has assets) and apply to the court to enforce
the judgment. The court then orders the losing party to pay the money. If the
party refuses, the court eventually orders assets to be seized and sold.
324
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

You may be wondering, “If Chinese courts are protectionist, what are the
chances that I can enforce my arbitration award?” Good question. Under
Chinese law, a court almost always must enforce an arbitration award for
monetary damages. If a court refuses to enforce an award, it must justify
itself to the Supreme People’s Court. Courts rarely refuse to enforce awards.
Courts don’t have to enforce arbitration awards when they find a defect in
the arbitration agreement (or clause) or when the arbitration procedure was
unfair. The former problem is more common.
You may note that we’re discussing monetary damages. In many legal sys-
tems, courts and arbitration panels can also order a party to perform a con-
tract (“specific performance”) or to stop doing something (“enjoining” that
party or issuing an “injunction”). Although Chinese courts can issue these
types of judgments, the enforcement of nonmonetary awards from arbitration
is much less clear.
If you want to have nonmonetary judgments available to you, confer with a
lawyer to decide whether to avoid arbitration entirely or to carve out certain
types of disputes from the arbitration clause so they have to be heard in court.
Note: If you lose the arbitration and have to pay the Chinese party, your
attorney will advise you when to pay and make an official record.
Protecting Intellectual Property
You’ve likely heard time and again that you really have to worry about intel-
lectual property (IP) infringement when doing business in China. That’s not
precisely true — you have to worry about IP infringement in China before you
even begin doing business there! This section tells you how to protect — but
first establish — your IP in China.
Getting IP registered early
A number of laws on the books protect patent, trademark, and copyright
holders’ rights. However, the main issue is how you get China to recognize
your IP. Unlike many systems, China’s IP system is a first-to-file system (other
countries often use a first-to-develop). In other words, who developed the IP
doesn’t matter — in China, the owner is the first one to file an application for
the patent, copyright, or trademark.
Some people from China travel the world looking for IP that they can register in
China. They’re either looking to make money using the IP in the Chinese market
or waiting for the developers to come to China and pay them off. A number of
foreign investors have been unpleasantly surprised by raids on their facilities
325
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China

because they were using what they thought was their own IP in China but were
unknowingly committing infringement under the Chinese system!
Regardless of whether you think this system is fair, you should register all
your IP in China as soon as you read this section — even if you don’t plan to
do business there. Every now and then, you hear about a foreign company
that didn’t mind that somebody else registered its trademark in China
because they weren’t planning on playing in the China market. But then 
inferior goods manufactured under that trademark started hitting China’s
markets. Although these companies weren’t necessarily planning on doing
business in China, they certainly didn’t want their brand equity destroyed
there, either.
When registering patents in China, the process isn’t as simple as translating
your home-country patent into Chinese. Certain differences exist in what is
and isn’t protected. If you care about the IP, don’t take shortcuts (although a
translation is admittedly better than nothing).
Taking proactive legal measures
After you register your IP portfolio, take both legal and practical precautions
to guard against infringement. On the legal side, have your IP attorneys moni-
tor IP filings to see whether anybody is attempting to register something that
infringes on your IP. Unlike in some other countries, the IP offices usually
don’t spot infringement in the applications.
326
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 
The brochure looked nice: Protecting 
unlikely forms of IP
In 2006, the management of a high-end
American tool company went to China looking
to source products or to possibly form a joint
venture. They spoke informally with a number of
companies in various parts of the country, hand-
ing them company brochures and being fairly
general about what they were looking for.
They must’ve really impressed one of the poten-
tial partners because after the meeting, the
Chinese company immediately went to work
researching the American company’s market
position. The Chinese company found out that
the brand is very well respected in the West and
stands for high quality. What did the Chinese
company then do? It trademarked the brand in
China, becoming the rightful owner. This story is
partly a lesson in filing as soon as possible, but
it also reinforces the need for confidentiality
and non-compete agreements for even casual
conversations.

All employees, consultants, and potential suppliers and business partners
should be made to sign confidentiality and non-compete agreements. Such
agreements prohibit the other parties from disclosing your confidential infor-
mation or competing with you. These agreements should also clearly state
that your company owns the specified IP. Again, work on this agreement in
connection with an attorney who knows the local laws. In order to be
enforceable, some non-compete agreements need separate compensation
(apart from salary) to the party agreeing not to compete.
If you suspect that infringement or trade secret theft is taking place, you have
options in addition to suing to enforce your IP rights. You can ask the authori-
ties to pursue criminal and administrative actions against the infringer. China
has criminal penalties and fines for infringing IP or competing “unfairly”
(which includes a lot of IP misuse). However, you usually need to deliver the
authorities the entire case — evidence, identities, time and place to raid, and
so on — in order to get them to take action. They’re not usually in the busi-
ness of conducting investigations themselves. Some investigative agencies in
China specialize in tracking down IP infringers and gathering the evidence.
Practicing realistic precautions
Yes, China has plenty of legal protections for IP. However, any stroll down a
crowded street in a major Chinese city can tell you that something’s still
missing. Enforcement is still a major issue (although it’s getting better).
Therefore, you need to take practical measures to protect your IP:
327
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China
We’ve created a monster: Corporate betrayal
One foreign company originally thought it had
found the perfect supplier of metal seat frames —
a Chinese company that made a similar product
but used different processes. Working with this
company seemed to be a good idea because its
existing knowledge meant a quicker startup. The
Chinese company also knew the market for seat
frames well.
After some time, however, the Chinese com-
pany added its Western client’s frame design to
its own product catalog. In one fell swoop, the
Chinese company became a competitor.
USActive, which specializes in helping manu-
facturers set up and source in China, found the
Western company a new supplier that had
experience in welding metal frames but no seat
frame experience. The supplier took longer to
get to production, but the chance that it’ll
become a competitor is much lower.

 Don’t let anyone see the whole picture. Get different components 
manufactured at different factories, preferably in different areas. This
setup adds to the management challenge, but some companies (such as
USActive, www.us-active.com) can help manage these relationships.
Compartmentalize as much as possible, even within your company.
Make people sign in and sign out valuable information, and consider
leaving any particularly valuable IP at home.
 Guard your tools and equipment. Some companies who partner with
Chinese companies think giving their partners the tool designs so they
can buy the tools themselves is a good, cost-saving idea; it usually isn’t.
If you don’t keep track of your tools, your workers or your partner can
use them to do extra production runs, competing with you on the
market. The tools should be available only during production runs.
When you’re not using them, either lock them up or remove them from
the factory. As Paul Stepanek of USActive says, “Your tools are your
jewels. It is essential to own and control them.”
 Don’t partner with potential competitors. As we discuss in Chapter 12,
partnering with a company that sells the same type of products as you
do can get you some (but usually not great) distribution; however, when
you partner with a company that makes competing products, the part-
ner can take your technology and practices and start selling without
you. Factor any worries about IP leakage and competition into the deci-
sion of whether to partner for distribution.
 Keep your distance in joint ventures. Naturally, when operating a JV,
you have an increased risk of having IP infringed. Such infringement 
usually happens more often in the less-developed areas. One way to 
cut down the risk is by not establishing the JV very close to the Chinese
partner’s operation. If the facilities are located close together, having
important information pass to the partner is more likely. The same thing
can happen when the partner’s employees are working in both the JV
and the partner’s company.
Managing Environmental Risks
Most FIEs take the view that although some Chinese companies may be able
to push the envelope as far as environmental compliance goes, complying
with the law in this area is generally best. China’s getting more serious about
environmental compliance all the time. Even minor malfeasance can result in
enormous potential liability for your company.
328
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Surveying environmental 
crime and punishment
China doles out several types of punishment for violating environmental 
standards:
 Jail: If your company does something extremely egregious to the 
environment, your legal representative and other senior managers 
can go to jail. This result is rare.
 Curtailing or halting operations: The authorities can order your 
company to curb production or shut down, usually temporarily.
 Inability to expand: When a company gets to a point where its site 
can’t hold any more contaminants by law, it may not be allowed to
expand the business.
 Fines: Fines are common. They don’t usually exceed 100,000 RMB.
 Cleaning up: Your company may have to remediate your site if it uses up
its pollution quota. Also, China’s law is moving toward U.S.-style liability,
in which a company can be liable for pre-existing pollution on a site.
 Bad publicity: Some cities, such as Shanghai, are putting environmental
offenders’ names on the Internet. If you look at these sites, you may be
surprised to see the names of a number of multinationals. This penalty
creates the risk of damaging your reputation — particularly if your com-
pany is large and well known.
In addition to pollution limitations that the law imposes, the authorities
measure your company’s pollution against the estimates contained in the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which you have to complete as part
of the application process for most manufacturing businesses (see Chapter
13 for details). In addition to being a prerequisite for construction, the EIA is
important because it’s your company’s commitment on pollution levels. If the
pollution exceeds the amounts in the EIA, the authorities may prohibit expan-
sion and/or require your company to somehow fix the situation.
Practicing more than good intentions
FIEs can easily end up violating environmental standards unintentionally.
Generally, FIEs focus more on worker safety. Although worker safety is quite
important, don’t take your eyes off environmental issues. Here are the three
areas where FIEs commonly have to watch out:
 Hazardous waste management
 Wastewater treatment
 Chemical management
329
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China

Be especially careful with hazardous waste management. First, you need 
to implement proper segregation, transportation, and storage procedures.
China doesn’t have many licensed and qualified hazardous waste disposal
companies. If your disposal company doesn’t do its job properly, your 
company may have to pay to remediate the disposal company’s land! Know
whom you’re dealing with for waste disposal.
FIEs can easily have problems from employee mishandling of pollutants 
and chemicals. Unless you thoroughly train employees, don’t expect them 
to know how to properly store and dispose of substances. As the nearby 
sidebar illustrates, even a small mistake can create a huge problem.
Getting help
Monitoring your impact on the environment and staying in line with the law
is a lot of work. This section discusses when to get some help and how much
the bills may run.
Purchasing land
To guard against environmental offenses, you need to understand the state 
of the land before you purchase it. You almost certainly want to conduct a
Phase I investigation of your planned site. Environmental consulting firms
such as Environmental Resources Management (ERM) do site investigations.
This step can tell you whether the land has any preexisting environmental
conditions that can affect your business. For a 10,000 m2 parcel, this investi-
gation usually costs around US$5,000.
330
Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 
Flushing money down the toilet — 
and into the water table
Even a small gap in training can have multi-
million-dollar consequences for your company.
Dr. Yong Wang heads Environmental Resources
Management (ERM, www.erm.com), one of
the world’s leading environmental consulting
firms, in China. ERM has a number of clients in
China that engage it to periodically assess how
they’re impacting the environment. Yong tells the
story of an FIE’s routine environmental audit that
uncovered a big problem — trichloroethylene
(TCE), an odorless, colorless solvent, in the water
table. The concentration exceeded standards by
2,000 times. When ERM investigated, it traced
the cause of the pollution to a single incident.
One of the factory workers had disposed of two
liters (a medium-sized soda bottle’s worth) of TCE
by flushing it down the toilet. That single flush led
to the company’s reserving several million dol-
lars to clean up the TCE!

Completing the Environmental Impact Assessment
By law, you need a licensed company to perform the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA). The EIA can vary a lot in time and complexity. After sub-
mitting the EIA, the consultant has to answer questions and concerns from a
locally convened panel of experts. Depending on the level of comments, the
EIA may need significant revisions. In 2006, the State Environmental
Protection Agency rejected 30 percent of initial EIAs.
Many companies don’t account for the potentially significant costs and
delays involved in the EIA process. Make sure your planning factors in possi-
ble issues here. The time to prepare and receive approval for the EIA can
vary from one month to one year, at a cost of roughly US$5,000 to US$50,000.
Maintaining pollution controls and legal compliance
Especially if you’re opening your first factory in China, you need help from 
an experienced environmental consulting firm to design proper pollution 
controls and training programs. Conducting periodic audits to benchmark
progress is also a good idea. You need to monitor how your usage affects 
pollution concentration. Audits generally cost US$5,000 to US$10,000.
You should ensure that your consultant keeps you up-to-date on changes 
in environmental laws and regulations that affect you. As in many areas of
Chinese law, environmental regulations change rapidly. The direction of
change is definitely toward strictness.
Insuring Your Business Risks
China is a risky place to do business, and the risk is more than the possibility
of losing capital in a failed market entry — or someone knocking off your
product and selling it for a fraction greater than your cost. Just think about
the physical risks to your business in China: typhoon, flood, earthquake.
The earthquake risk alone is enough to make you shake in your boots.
Northeast China’s Tangshan earthquake of 1976, which registered 8.2 on the
Richter scale, leveled the city and killed about 250,000 people. The govern-
ment rebuilt the entire city.
You can’t prevent natural disasters, but you can make sure your company’s
finances don’t end up in ruins. The Chinese market has opened up to foreign
insurers in recent years. You can now choose from a good selection of com-
panies and products to help your company with its insurance needs. This
section goes over some of your options.
331
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China

Controlling the insurance program
Chinese companies commonly want to control the insurance program instead
of allowing you to take an active role, especially in joint ventures. But your
company’s insurance arrangements are too important to leave to someone
else to manage. And you never know whether the Chinese people you’re 
dealing with want control of the program because they have some financial
interest in mind.
Make sure your company controls the insurance program — even if it may
come in at a potentially higher cost. The Chinese tend to look at insurance as
an expense instead of focusing on the real benefits insurance can deliver.
Getting insurance advice
Some of the largest insurance brokers in the world now have a presence in
China. The large commercial brokers are good resources for risk management
and insurance services for larger firms. For small- and medium-sized firms
operating in China, be sure to contact your insurance agent or broker back
home for assistance. Your professional insurance advisor can review your
business risks in China and help you develop the right risk and insurance
management program. Such a program usually includes periodic inspections
or surveys of your physical premises in China.
Knowing your choices of companies
More and more insurance companies are now licensed to do business in
China. As a result, competition has heated up, and more companies are
trying to differentiate themselves from competitors by creating more insur-
ance products for the local market. The result is that the insurance market in
China is becoming increasingly sophisticated, which is good news for compa-
nies looking to protect their China operations.
Many foreign companies have entered the Chinese market over the last ten
years or so, mostly from Europe and North America. You can find Japanese
companies in the China market as well as a handful of insurance companies
from elsewhere.
Some companies tend to stick with insurance companies from their home
country, although you can choose from plenty of other good companies that
have a track record of fair dealings. Most foreign insurance companies in
China have global brands and strong reputations.

Part IV: Building Successful Business Relationships 

Reputable Chinese companies are in the market, too. Some foreign compa-
nies are quite satisfied with the products and services that Chinese insurance
companies provide. Chinese companies can be competitive on price — if not
cheaper — than foreign insurance companies operating there. At the end of
the day, your professional insurance advisor can guide your company on the
pros and cons of dealing with specific insurance companies in China. For
more info, see the previous section titled “Getting insurance advice.”
Looking at basic types of insurance
In this section, you find a handy list of the types of insurance available to
small- to medium-sized firms in China. This list isn’t exhaustive by any
means. You should know that not all insurance companies carry the same
products. And of course, you should consult your professional insurance
advisor on all matters related to your company’s insurance program in China.
Property insurance
Property insurance includes the following:
 So-called All Risks property insurance coverage for your plant, office,
or warehouse: It covers building, machinery, stock, and so on. (Of
course, exclusions are in every insurance policy!)
 Business interruption or consequential loss insurance: This insurance
covers your company for loss of profits caused by business interruption
as a result of fire or other type of peril.
 Money insurance: Money insurance includes coverage for a loss of cash
due to, say, a burglary.
Liability insurance
General liability insurance protects your company from losses involving your
premises as well as your operations in China. Other liability policies may be
available:
 Product liability: Protects your company from awards for injuries
resulting from products you sell or manufacture
 Employers’ liability: Covers liabilities to employees for work-related
injuries
 Directors’ and officers’ liability: Protects executives of your company
for any personal liability while performing their jobs
Like most countries, China’s laws require certain insurance. One such policy
is third-party automotive liability insurance. Be sure to consult your profes-
sional insurance advisor to ensure compliance with China’s insurance laws.
333
Chapter 17: Managing Risks in China

Transportation risks
Transportation risks coverage protects your goods in transit by sea and air. A
separate policy can be arranged to cover your local transits by truck in and
around where you do business in China.
Sourcing risks
Even if your China activities are limited to sourcing from China, you’re poten-
tially exposed to real business risks in China. What would happen if your
sourcing partner’s plant were to burn to the ground tomorrow? Could your
company recover from a disaster like this? Is your sourcing partner insured
at all? If so, what’s in it, if anything, for you? If your company does its sourc-
ing from China, you need to take a close look at the way you manage your
business risks in China.
A little-known or -understood type of insurance called contingency business
interruption can protect your company from an interruption in the business
of your supplier. It may be able to help your company protect your profit or
revenue caused by certain events outside of your company’s control.
Specialty insurance
More-sophisticated types of insurance coverage may also be available to
your company. These types may include political risk, trade credit to protect
your receivables, supply chain coverage against potential disruption, and
more. The availability of these products to your firm really depends on the
size of your company. Many of these more-specialized coverages have mini-
mum premiums that may be out of reach for small companies. Talk to your
professional insurance advisor for details.
Companies also offer many kinds of specialty insurance for manufacturers.
Construction insurance is available to protect your building while it’s being
built. Machinery breakdown insurance covers boilers, production machinery,
and so on.
Many insurance companies provide small- to medium-sized firms with bun-
dled products for property, liability, local transit, money, and so on under a
so-called package policy.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n the great tradition of top ten lists, all For Dummies
books conclude with The Part of Tens, which provides
lists of tips, need-to-know info, and generally fun things to
do. We begin by listing ten clauses you should make sure
your lawyers include in your various contracts. We then
list the ten best places to go to when you have some time
off. Finally, we point out the ten things that can keep your
company on the path to profitability in China.

Chapter 18
Ten Clauses You Want 
in Your Contracts
In This Chapter
 Important clauses for all your China contracts
 Key clauses for more specific needs
M
any companies end up in disputes because the purchase orders or
contracts aren’t specific enough. Regardless of the type of contract,
describe what you want from the other side in as much detail as you can.
Handshake agreements don’t usually work well — especially in China.
This chapter provides a checklist of clauses that are applicable to most con-
tracts (as well as a few clauses that are for specific situations) to better pre-
pare you for discussions with your legal counsel. You may also be able to get
a better idea of whether your counsel is doing a good job of representing you.
Note that this chapter doesn’t tell you how to adapt one of your standard
agreements to China, and it isn’t a substitute for retaining a lawyer experi-
enced in China to draft your contracts.
Governing Language
The governing language clause determines which language version of an
agreement is the official version in the event of an inconsistency in the two
language versions. This clause is important because translation errors
happen much more often than most people know.

In the case of joint venture (JV) contracts, many authorities are reluctant to
approve an agreement that reads Chinese isn’t the governing language. If the
other party won’t agree to English or another foreign governing language, you
should specify that both language versions are equally authentic and control-
ling. This idea seems paradoxical, but that way you don’t automatically lose
the dispute because of the inconsistency. You can also try to augment this
clause with a reference that the agreement was concluded based on discus-
sions in a foreign language. That way, arbitrators may give more weight to the
foreign language version in case of a conflict.
Telling the other party that you want English (or another foreign language)
to govern the contract often leads to their insisting on Chinese being 
the governing language. The subtle approach — writing that both lan-
guage versions are equally authentic and controlling but based on English 
discussions — is more likely to work when the parties haven’t argued the 
governing language point yet.
Arbitration Clause and Governing Law
When you need to settle a dispute, arbitration is usually cheaper and faster
than carrying on lawsuits. Chinese courts almost always enforce arbitration
awards, so arbitration is definitely the way to go to secure your right to
recover monetary damages. (However, you usually don’t want arbitration if
you’re seeking nonmonetary damages, such as an injunction or specific per-
formance.) Selecting the proper arbitration panel is obviously key. That the
clause be drafted precisely is similarly important. We discuss arbitration and
arbitration clauses in detail in Chapter 17.
Specify a governing law — which country’s law applies to the agreement — 
in the contract. Governing law should be one of the first considerations the
parties discuss because it affects the way the contracts are drafted. Chinese
law must govern some types of contracts (such as Sino-foreign joint ven-
tures), but in most other types of agreements, the parties may choose the
governing law.
Try not to choose something too quirky, or you’ll have a tough time finding
arbitrators versed in that law. Some people wrongly believe choosing the 
law of “neutral” countries such as Switzerland or Sweden and using them as
arbitration forums is a good idea. Choosing either law is fine provided that 
the lawyer drafting the documents knows Swiss or Swedish law. Otherwise,
stick with something that you and the attorneys have knowledge of. Also, the
historical neutrality of certain countries has no relationship to their merits as
arbitration forums.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The People’s Republic of China (PRC) contract law isn’t anti-foreigner. The
issue is that it’s not as comprehensive — the law has holes and gaps. For
many run-of-the-mill agreements, PRC law should be fine as your governing
law (although you need to confirm that on a case-by-case basis with an 
attorney).
Confidentiality/Non-Compete
Get parties to sign a confidentiality/non-compete agreement before you even
have informal talks — you don’t want to inspire the Chinese party to go off
and do the same business that you do!
In addition to all potential suppliers and other partners, the following people
should sign confidentiality/non-compete agreements:
 All employees
 If you’re doing a JV, all your partner’s employees who’ll be involved in
working for the JV
If you’re planning on providing any valuable technical information to a
Chinese supplier, you may consider doing due diligence to see whether their
employees are bound by confidentiality/non-competes. We discuss these
issues in Chapter 17.
Force Majeure
Force majeure (“greater force”) clauses excuse performance because of cir-
cumstances beyond the parties’ control, such as acts of God, wars, terrorism,
and so on. The clause is designed to cover those unknowable or improbable
events that aren’t part of normal business.
Indemnity
Indemnity is an agreement that the other party will cover all expenses and lia-
bilities in certain situations. In the West, parties are often adequately insured,
so indemnities can be quite broad. Many Chinese parties don’t have good
insurance, so you’re likely to get more resistance on the indemnity provisions
from them.
339
Chapter 18: Ten Clauses You Want in Your Contracts

You have to balance the need to protect your company against the risk of
breaking the deal. Keep in mind that because of the lack of insurance, you
can reasonably expect only so much indemnity out of most Chinese parties.
The agreement does neither of you any good if the Chinese side goes bank-
rupt because of its indemnity obligation to your company. Nevertheless, 
protect your company through indemnity as much as you can under the cir-
cumstances. We discuss indemnity in Chapter 12.
Written Modification Only
Written modification only clauses make sure that all contract modifications are
in writing. As we discuss in Chapter 13, this concept is particularly important
in construction contracts. Written modification only clauses usually accrue
to your benefit, although be sure that you abide by this provision yourself. If
you verbally agree to a modification, write it out and execute it with the other
party.
Sovereign Immunity Waiver
Most countries allow the government to have sovereign immunity, which
means that people can’t sue the government for damages unless it waives 
the immunity. The sovereign immunity waiver is only for when you’re doing
business with the government, quasi-governmental bodies, or state-owned
enterprises (SOEs). For instance, you’d want to use this waiver if you were to
execute an investment agreement with a local government or government
company. Typically, the contract guarantees various benefits and incentives
for your company.
Most lawyers don’t consider this waiver an ironclad guarantee that you 
can enforce a judgment or arbitration award on a governmental or quasi-
governmental party. It’s pretty untested, actually. However, this provision is
better than nothing, particularly because it provides a disincentive for bad
behavior.
Reps and Warranties
Reps (representatives) and warranties are statements that a party makes
about itself or its property in a contract. For example, a party may represent
that a certain asset isn’t subject to any liens. Reps and warranties are 
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

standard in many more-complex types of agreements. Having at least a few
basic reps and warranties in most (if not all) of your China-related agree-
ments is a good idea.
Somewhere, the agreement should contain (in reps and warranties, termina-
tion, or elsewhere) a provision that allows you to terminate without penalty if
the other party breaches a rep or warranty. Sometimes, you can specify that
you’re entitled to compensation for the breach of a rep or warranty.
The reps and warranties you need depend on your circumstances. You
should discuss this idea with your lawyer. At a minimum, the counterparty
should represent that
 It’s duly authorized to enter into the agreement.
 It’s duly organized under the laws of China (or some other jurisdiction).
 It isn’t violating any law, regulation, rule, or policy by entering or 
performing the agreement.
Conditions Precedent
More-complex arrangements, such as JVs, can have a number of moving
parts. You want to ensure that you commit as little money and effort as 
possible until you’re reasonably certain the deal will move forward. When
you’re able to identify certain milestones that need to be achieved in order 
to progress (such as receipt of a business license or land-use rights), you 
can use them as conditions precedent to actions on your part. In other
words, you can state that the JV must obtain land-use rights before you 
contribute the remainder of your portion of the registered capital.
Cross-Termination
Every agreement should have a termination provision (unless it’s indefinite,
in which case that should be explicitly stated). A termination provision typi-
cally specifies the length of the agreement while allowing one or both parties
to cancel under certain circumstances (for example, with 30 days written
notice). Along with a termination provision, you want a survival provision
that states certain clauses will continue to be in effect after termination.
Survival commonly covers confidentiality/non-compete provisions and
record-keeping obligations. (We discuss confidentiality/non-compete clauses
earlier in this chapter.)
341
Chapter 18: Ten Clauses You Want in Your Contracts

Cross-termination clauses are necessary in situations in which the parties have
multiple agreements. For example, it’s common to set up a joint venture and
then for the individual partners to sign agreements (usually as customers or
suppliers) with the JV. Well, what happens to those other agreements if the JV
contract is terminated? The more complex the web of contracts becomes, the
more crucial it is to ask, “If contract A is terminated, what do I want to happen
to contracts B through F?” Work with your attorney to game out these scenar-
ios and draft the appropriate cross-termination provisions.

Ten Fun Ways to Spend 
Your Downtime in China
In This Chapter
 Getting to know some of China’s best tourist attractions
 Seeing the traditional sights in and around the major business centers
 Going inland to see some wonderful places to visit
C
hina has so many wonderful places to visit — limiting the list to just ten
in this chapter was really hard to do! All you need is some spare time
from your busy business schedule. (But try to avoid the major tourist sites
during Chinese holidays — the locals like to tour the sights as well during
their time off.) With a few exceptions, most of these places to visit are near
the major business centers. So join your company colleagues and have some
fun by taking in the sights together.
Climb the Great Wall
At nearly 4,000 miles long, the Great Wall is the longest manmade structure in
the world. It has a long history, too — the Chinese began building walls on
their borders more than 2,000 years ago. In some sections, you can take a
gondola, ride a “toboggan,” or even zip-line down from the Great Wall!
The wall is about 45 miles due north of Beijing. For busy businesspeople like
you, hiring a private car or minivan and heading out to the Great Wall on your
own may make good sense. Ask your local Chinese contacts or your travel
agent back home to help you make the necessary arrangements.

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The vendors who hang out at the Great Wall can be annoying, and they don’t
have a very good reputation. They’ve been known for keeping the change,
even when you ask them for it! Just try to avoid them if you can.
Some sections of the Great Wall can be dangerous, so be careful when you’re
scrambling about the steep inclines. Bring a good pair of comfortable shoes
to wear (and an extra layer of clothing from fall through spring). The last
thing you need is a visit to a hospital before finding yourself in a first-class
seat going home, with your propped-up broken leg as your souvenir! You
wouldn’t be the first person — or the last — to go home that way.
Wander through the Forbidden City
The Forbidden City in the central part of Beijing is right on Tiananmen
Square. The emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties lived there. The Great
Hall of the People and Mao’s mausoleum are on the square as well. You can
wind your way through some impressive imperial buildings and the grounds.
A good audio tour is available, too.
Start on the south side at the main entrance to get the best experience when
entering the main gates and then snaking your way through the many court-
yards. You can easily catch a taxi (except when it’s raining) when you exit
from the north side of the Forbidden City.
Avoid the Forbidden City (and other Chinese tourist attractions) on Sundays.
This centrally located tourist destination can be overrun with locals, out-of-
town Chinese, visiting overseas Chinese tour groups, and foreign tourists
from all corners of the world.
Enjoy the Peacefulness of 
the Temple of Heaven
In Beijing, you can marvel at the beauty of the Temple of Heaven and its large
surrounding grounds. The structures are certainly some of China’s most mag-
nificent architecture — the Imperial Vault of Heaven is a real jewel box. Built
in the early part of A.D. 1400, the Temple of Heaven’s massive grounds are
surrounded by a wall. The temple was originally used for sacrifices to the

heavens during the Ming dynasty. For people with limited time for touring in
the capital city, this is an excellent tourist stop while in Beijing.
The traffic in Beijing, like many other large Chinese cities, can be a real night-
mare. Be sure to leave some margin of safety in your travel schedule.
Roam around the Summer Palace
Situated around Kunming Lake, the Summer Palace grounds were a resting
place for the Chinese imperial family in the late 1800s. Wandering around the
lake provides gorgeous views of the surrounding scenery. The gardens are
reminiscent of those throughout China. Some of the featured attractions
include Longevity Hill, the Long Corridor, and the famous Marble Boat. The
Summer Palace is about ten miles west of Beijing.
Avoid the Summer Palace on Sundays unless you really want to be a part of a
large crowd.
Take In the Ming Tombs
About 30 miles northwest of Beijing lie the 13 tombs of the Ming emperors
(1368–1644). Only two of the Ming Tombs have been excavated and are open
to the public. Each of the tombs is tucked away in a hillside in this quiet and
lovely valley. All are linked by a road called the Sacred Way, or the road lead-
ing to heaven. The Sacred Way has a display of beautiful human and animal
figures carved from stone.
Have your hotel make you a special boxed lunch for the trip so you can enjoy
a quiet picnic on the peaceful grounds.
Stroll the Bund in Shanghai
The Bund — in Chinese, wai tan (pronounced why tan) — is the area along
the Huangpu River near the center of Shanghai. It was part of the old interna-
tional settlement area, occupied by foreign residents in the 1800s and early
1900s.
345
Chapter 19: Ten Fun Ways to Spend Your Downtime in China

The mile-long stretch along the riverfront is one of the more interesting archi-
tectural sights in the world. On the Bund side of the river are the stately old
European bank buildings; across the river is the ultra-futuristic landscape of
the city of Pudong.
The Bund is best viewed after dark, when the historic buildings on the Bund
are basked in lights from Pudong. After strolling the Bund, consider having
dinner or drinks there — it offers many excellent options. For dining, try
Laris, Jean-Georges, New Heights, and M on the Bund; for drinks, check 
out Glamour Bar, Vault (in Laris), and Attica (which is an enormous club).
The Pudong side of the Bund also offers some great views. Our favorite
bar/restaurant for views in Pudong is Jade on 36 in the Shangri-La Hotel.
Tour Suzhou, the Venice of the East
A famous Chinese saying goes like this: “In heaven, there is paradise; on
earth, there are Suzhou and Hangzhou.” Filled with many beautiful gardens
and lovely wandering canals, Suzhou is perhaps the most beautiful city in
China. The Humble Administrator’s garden is absolutely magnificent. It’s one
of the four classic gardens in Suzhou and is considered one of the finest in
China. Suzhou is just a train or car ride from Shanghai.
Hangzhou is also a magnificent place to visit. The famous West Lake is well
worth the trip there. Hangzhou is a little over 100 miles from Shanghai.
Visit Historic Xi’an
Xi’an (pronounced shee-an), one of China’s ancient capital cities and a major
tourist destination, is located in the central part of China. It’s now the capital
city of the Shaanxi province and one of China’s top ten cities in terms of 
population.
The city’s rich history spans more than 3,000 years. Xi’an is the home of the
terracotta army soldiers and horses commissioned by China’s first emperor,
Qin Shi Huang. (A farmer discovered the site as he was digging a well in
1974.) While in Xi’an, consider taking the time to see the ancient city walls
and the Goose Pagodas as well.
346
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Appreciate the Enchanting 
Beauty of Guilin
Guilin, famous for its scenic limestone formations, is one of the most pic-
turesque places to visit in China. Its stone peaks — which seem to reach for
the sky — are truly magical. Getting to see the countryside outside of Guilin
can be interesting for visitors — you get a glimpse of what rural life in China
is all about. Guilin is located in southern China and is best reached by plane.
Consider taking a guided boat trip down the Li River to enjoy the magnificent
views of the natural scenery. You’ll see peasants farming the terraced hill-
sides, water buffaloes roaming around the paddies, and cormorant fishermen
(who use birds to fetch fish!) working their trade.
Cruise the Yangtze River
For visitors to China with some time to spare, you can find nothing quite like
a trip on the Yangtze River. The river is the longest in Asia — nearly 4,000
miles long! It stretches from the mountains of southwest China to the mouth
of the river — just north of Shanghai. The scenic views from onboard the
cruise ships that ply the river are simply wonderful.
Many cruise ship options are available. Check with your travel agent for the
package that suits you best. You can also visit the Three Gorges Dam, the
world’s largest hydroelectric dam.

Ten Ways to Stay on the 
Path to Profitability
In This Chapter
 Planning ahead and protecting your company
 Keeping your company on the right track
 Making sure your company is firing on all cylinders
S
ometimes getting your business to scale in China and making profits
seem harder than climbing the Great Wall! We’ve come up with ten ideas
that can help your business succeed. These points are good advice for first-
time businesspeople considering doing business in China. If your company
has already started in China, read through this list and see how many points
already apply to your business.
Respect China but Don’t Be Awed by It
China is quite different from what you’re used to, but that doesn’t mean you
should throw out what you know about business. You have to strike the right
balance between insisting on your best practices and allowing for Chinese
variations. You can bring a number of good business practices to the Chinese
market — practices that may be in short supply in China.
However, don’t be arrogant and think you can transplant every aspect of 
your business model to China. Just know that some things will and should
transfer; others won’t. You have to figure these things out for yourself.

350
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Develop Your Business Plan
Business planning in China is another way to help your company stay on the
right course. These plans prepare you to deal with China’s complex, shifting
markets. Here’s how:
 You describe goals and objectives. In a place where approval processes
and other tasks may be unfamiliar, you set out plans to divide responsi-
bility and ensure that everything gets done.
 You do in-depth, targeted research to size up the competition, analyze
your financial situation, and describe your markets.
 You anticipate problems and come up with possible solutions — before
problems happen. Being prepared for contingencies and changes in the
marketplace — whether through new laws, new competitors, or failed
deals — puts your company in a better position to respond in a way
that’s best for your business.
 Having a written document that lays out your plans can help all your
businesspeople send a consistent message to the Chinese.
See Chapter 4 for more info on business plans.
Decide between a Wholly Foreign-Owned
Enterprise and a Joint Venture
Today, many more companies are going the wholly foreign-owned enterprise
(WFOE) route than joint venture (JV) option. Either can work for your 
company, depending on circumstances and goals.
In some respects, you can think of JVs as the faster way to start up — 
particularly with getting distribution, having a factory and workforce, and
making your way through the approvals process faster. But you do run into 
a lot of trade-offs that can be apparent in the medium- to long-term. You 
need your partner’s consent for many key decisions. Plus, you increase the
chances of intellectual property (IP) leakage.
Starting a WFOE usually takes longer to get your operations going, and you
have to figure out a lot more on your own than with a JV. However, you never
have to worry about dealing with a problematic partner.
Chapter 7 can tell you more about JVs and WFOEs.

Tailor Your Products for Local Markets
National brands don’t rule the Chinese marketplace as in much of the West.
China is a blend of markets, so getting local in China can have a big payoff.
Make sure the products you intend to sell in China meet the needs and wants
of the local market. Conduct appropriate market research to help you tweak
your products for China, and don’t neglect the regional variations in your
marketing and sales plans. (See Chapter 4 for info on research.)
Do Your Due Diligence
Always perform due diligence when evaluating the capabilities of a potential
supplier or partner. Some people in China suggest that companies should
conduct due diligence twice. Although we don’t think that suggestion is
appropriate, you must be very thorough — even ruthless — in your research.
You can perform different types of due diligence — for example, financial,
legal, technical, background, and environmental. If your company has the
technical capability, you should be able to perform technical due diligence
yourself.
Legal due diligence can cover a wide range of items, from asset titles to legal
compliance. You can do minimal legal due diligence when evaluating a poten-
tial business arrangement by going to the Administration for Industry and
Commerce (AIC) and looking at the business license of the other party. The
license can tell you who’s authorized to sign contracts for the company and
who the owners are (which may differ from what you’ve been told), and it
can give you an idea of the company’s financial strength. Most other forms of
due diligence require professional assistance. See Chapter 17 for details.
Make Sure Your Company 
Is Properly Protected
Many foreign companies take on too much business risk in China — some-
times without even knowing it. They usually find out the hard way, through
unexpected losses to their business.
351
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Stay on the Path to Profitability

Make sure your company — and not your Chinese partner — controls the
risk management and insurance program. So when you’re negotiating with a
Chinese partner, tell them that proper insurance coverage is important — so
much so that you want to make the arrangements. (If you plan to share costs
with them, be sure to get that point in writing from the Chinese side.) You
want to make sure your company assets, any legal liabilities, and potential
future profits are properly protected. Chapter 17 can tell you more about risk
management.
Instill Your Corporate Culture
Instill your corporate culture in your China operations. Without a serious
effort to imbue employees with your culture, you’ll be almost certain to have
a number of problems ranging from difficulty working with the home office to
internal control issues. Give your employees a sense of responsibility for the
success of the entire operation, and get them to buy into the idea of having
controls.
The best way to instill the culture is to appoint a general manager (GM)
who’s been with your company in its home market for a while and thoroughly
understands (and can convey) its culture. If you don’t have such a GM, defi-
nitely send human resources people over for long-term assignments to work
on the culture.
Take Charge of Quality and 
Financial Control
Many foreign firms have been burned in China due to the lack of quality 
controls — especially in the manufacturing process. If your company’s 
profitability is dependent on a supplier in China, make sure you have a 
permanent company representative on the ground in China. Chapter 13 can
tell you more about quality control.
Take control of the financial function as well. Be sure that a company 
representative based in China manages the finances. This person should 
act as a check on the GM’s authority. See Chapter 17 for more info on 
corporate governance.
352
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Find Professional Help When 
You Need It Most
Even if you have good people within your firm, you’re going to need outside
consultants and other professionals to perform certain key functions. For
example, China’s tax laws are quite complex, so you’ll need a competent 
tax advisor to help you. These helpers can range from external auditors to
companies that specialize in background checks on employees.
Don’t bring in a team of consultants or professionals from a firm in your
home market and then get a firm in China to tack on the “China-particular
aspects.” China isn’t an “aspect” of the assignment — it is the assignment.
Inter-firm cooperation rarely goes smoothly as a result.
Although many internationally recognized professional firms are in China,
you should do your homework before approaching them. As we discuss in
Chapter 4, the quality of the service you receive in China (even from well-
known firms) can vary drastically, depending on the individuals handling the
assignment. Ask around for recommendations for particular professionals
(whether at large firms or not) who do good jobs. Make sure that the firms
you use assign professionals who bring a good balance of China and Western
experience to your project.
Stay on the Government’s Good Side
Complying with the laws of both China and your home country is a must.
Make sure that the managers running your business in China are in compli-
ance. Internal audits are a great tool for doing so. Also, formally educate your
Chinese team about laws and get signed letters of compliance. (See Chapter 8
for more info on government relations.)
On a more personal note, figure out which government organizations and 
officials can help your business. Develop strong relationships with them. 
And don’t ever cross a government official; you may regret it later.
