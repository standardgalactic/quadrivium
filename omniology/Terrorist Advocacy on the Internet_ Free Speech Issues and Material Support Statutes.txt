INTRODUCTION 
 
The development of the Internet has revolutionized communications.1 It 
has never been easier to speak to wide audiences or to communicate with 
people who may be located more than half a world away from the speaker.2 
However, like any neutral platform, the Internet can be used for many different 
ends, including illegal, offensive, or dangerous purposes.3 Terrorist groups, 
such as the Islamic State (IS, also referred to as ISIS or ISIL),4 Al Qaeda,5 
Hamas,6 and Al Shabaab,7 use the Internet to disseminate their ideology, 
recruit new members, and take credit for attacks around the world. In addition, 
people who are not members of these groups may view such content and could 
begin to sympathize with or to adhere to the violent philosophies these groups 
advocate. They might even act on these beliefs.8 
For example, it has been reported that the sermons of Anwar al Awlaki 
were instrumental in influencing the ideology of certain individuals accused of 
terrorist activities, including the perpetrators of the San Bernardino shooting 
and the Boston Marathon bombers.9 Awlaki was a U.S. citizen who was 
targeted and killed by a drone strike on foreign soil.10 Awlaki left behind 
numerous digital videos on websites like YouTube of himself preaching his 
interpretation of the Islamic faith.11 Some of his videos expound upon less 

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet 
3
controversial topics such as respect for the holy month of Ramadan, the nature 
of marriage, or the relationship between Islam and Jesus Christ.12 However, 
other videos depict Awlaki exhorting his followers never to trust a non-
Muslim; that Muslims are at war with the United States; and, in a video 
entitled “Call to Jihad,” that “it is every Muslim’s religious duty to kill 
Americans.”13 It was messages like these, particularly the “Call to Jihad,” that 
reportedly motivated the San Bernardino and Boston Marathon attackers.14 
More broadly, the Islamic State organization has been known to use 
popular Internet services such as Twitter and YouTube to disseminate videos 
of its fighters executing prisoners, claim credit for organizing terrorist attacks 
such as the attack that occurred in Paris in November of 2015, and recruit new 
members to their cause.15 IS personnel also disseminate high-quality electronic 
publications encouraging supporters to conduct violent attacks in their 
communities. Members of Hamas and Al Shabaab have reportedly used 
Facebook and Twitter to disseminate their ideology as well.16 The media arm 
of Al Shabaab used Twitter to claim credit for the terrorist attack on the 
Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya and distribute information and 
pictures of the attack while it remained ongoing.17 
Speech advocating violence and terrorism is prohibited by the terms of 
service of Twitter, Facebook, and other social media outlets.18 Sites like 
Twitter reportedly have increased their efforts to disable accounts that are 
associated with terrorist groups or the advocacy of terrorist ideologies. 
However, these efforts have not been wholly successful.19 When one account 
is disabled, another might soon appear to replace it. 
Many policymakers, including some Members of Congress, have 
expressed concern about the influence the speech of terrorist groups and the 
speech of others who advocate terrorism can have on those who view or read 
it.20 Some policymakers have expressed particular concern regarding the ease 
by which persons who might otherwise not have been exposed to the ideology 
or recruitment efforts of terrorist entities may become radicalized.21 These 
concerns raise the question of whether it would be permissible for the federal 
government to restrict or prohibit the publication and distribution of speech 
that advocates the commission of terrorist acts when that speech appears on 
the Internet.22 
Significant First Amendment freedom of speech issues are raised by the 
prospect of government restrictions on the publication and distribution of 
speech, even speech that advocates terrorism. However, government 
restrictions on advocacy that is provided to foreign terrorist organizations as 
material support have been upheld as permissible. This report will discuss

relevant precedent that may limit the extent to which advocacy of terrorism 
may be restricted. The report will also discuss the potential application of the 
federal ban on the provision of material support to foreign terrorist 
organizations (FTOs) to the advocacy of terrorism and the dissemination of 
such advocacy by online service providers like Twitter or Facebook. 
 
 
CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES: ADVOCACY OF VIOLENCE 
OR LAWLESSNESS UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT 
 
The First Amendment to the Constitution states that “Congress shall 
make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.... ”23 According to the 
Supreme Court, “the First Amendment [generally] means that government 
has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its 
subject matter, or its content.”24 However, the freedom of speech is not 
absolute.25 Some speech, including fighting words, incitements to 
imminent violence, child pornography, and obscenity can be restricted by 
the government without constitutional concern.26 
Furthermore, courts do allow the government to place restrictions on 
protected speech under certain circumstances.27 When a restriction applies 
to speech based upon its content28 or upon the viewpoint expressed,29 courts 
generally apply the highest level of scrutiny, known as strict scrutiny.30 In 
order to satisfy strict scrutiny, a speech restriction must directly advance a 
compelling government interest and it must be the least restrictive means 
for achieving that interest. 31 It is rare that a law will survive this level of 
scrutiny.32 Generally, when a restriction is not directed at the content of 
speech or the viewpoint expressed, courts apply a less-exacting standard of 
scrutiny, known as intermediate scrutiny.33 Content-neutral restrictions on 
protected speech will be upheld if the government can show that the restriction 
advances a substantial government interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve 
that interest.34 In this way, the government is permitted to impose reasonable 
regulations on the time, place, and manner of speech.35 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet

Pure Advocacy of Violence and Law Breaking Under 
Brandenburg v. Ohio 
 
In Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court held that the First 
Amendment can protect the advocacy of lawbreaking and violence. 
Brandenburg overturned a conviction under Ohio’s criminal syndicalism 
statute, invalidating that statute.36 The statute, like other syndicalism laws, 
prohibited “advocat[ing] ... the duty, necessity, or propriety of crime, sabotage, 
violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism.”37 Members of the Ku Klux Klan 
had been convicted of violating that statute at a rally covered by a Cincinnati 
television station at the request of one of the Klan members.38 At the rally, 
among other incendiary comments, one of the members said “We’re not a 
revengent [sic] organization, but if our President, our Congress, our Supreme 
Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian race, it’s possible that there 
might have to be some revengeance [sic] taken.”39 Other statements 
advocating violence were made, as well. 
The Supreme Court overturned the convictions at issue because “the mere 
abstract teaching ... of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort 
to force and violence is not the same as preparing a group for violent action” 
and cannot be punished by the government in a manner consistent with the 
First Amendment.40 In order for speech inciting violence or lawlessness to fall 
outside of the ambit of the Free Speech Clause, the Court held that: 
 
1. the speech must be directed at . . . 
2. inciting “imminent lawless action” and 
3. the speech must also be likely to produce such action.41 
 
In other words, for punishment of speech advocating violence to be 
constitutional, the speaker must both intend to incite a violent or lawless action 
and that action must be likely to imminently occur as a result.42 In so holding, 
the Court invalidated Ohio’s criminal syndicalism statute,43 reasoning that the 
statute failed to draw the distinction between “mere abstract teaching” and 
“preparing a group for violent action” and, therefore, swept too broadly.44 
Consequently, in order for a statute that restricts the advocacy of violence or 
lawlessness to be constitutional, the statute must apply only to speech meeting 
the standard announced by the Court.45

Ambiguity in Brandenburg’s Scope 
 
As indicated by the Court in Brandenburg, speech that is intended to 
incite violent action and is likely to imminently produce such action is not 
protected by the First Amendment and may freely be proscribed by the 
government. However, the Court did not elaborate upon what it might mean 
for speech to be “likely to imminently produce” unlawful action.46 Therefore, 
it is unclear how imminent the violence advocated must be in order for speech 
to be able to be proscribed.47 
In Hess v. Indiana, the Supreme Court provided some guidance regarding 
“imminence” pursuant to Brandenburg.48 The defendant in Hess had been 
convicted of disorderly conduct.49 At an antiwar rally, he had been arrested for 
shouting “[we’ll] take the [expletive] street later.”50 The Court overturned his 
conviction because his statement “amounted to nothing more than advocacy of 
illegal action at some indefinite future time” and his statements were not 
directed to any person or group of persons.51 In the Court’s words, “there was 
no evidence, or rational inference from the import of the language that his 
words were intended to produce and likely to produce imminent disorder.”52 
Some argue that the Court’s decision in Hess indicated the Court viewed 
the “imminence” requirement to mean that violence must be likely to occur 
immediately as a result of the speech at issue.53 The Hess Court apparently did 
not think that a threat to “take the street” at some later point to be imminent or 
likely enough to be punished under Brandenburg.54 
However, state and federal courts have not always applied Hess or the 
imminence requirement of Brandenburg so strictly.55 For example, in People 
v. Rubin, a California state court ruling, Rubin was charged with solicitation of 
murder.56 During a press conference to protest a planned march by the Nazi 
Party through Skokie, Illinois, Rubin offered money to anyone who “kills, 
maims, or seriously injures a member of the American Nazi Party ... . The fact 
of the matter is that we’re deadly serious. This is not said in jest, we are deadly 
serious.”57 The trial court found that his speech was protected by the First 
Amendment, but the appeals court reversed.58 After reciting Brandenburg’s 
standard, the state appeals court held the defendant’s speech was directed to 
inciting lawless action, and that such action was likely to imminently occur, 
even though the march in Skokie was not scheduled to take place until five 
weeks after the defendant had spoken.59 In justifying its holding, the court 
wrote that “time is a relative dimension and imminence a relative term, and the 
imminence of an event is related to its nature.... We think solicitation of 

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet 
7
murder in connection with a public event of this notoriety, even though five 
weeks away, can qualify as incitement to imminent lawless action.”60 
The only other Supreme Court case to apply the standard announced in 
Brandenburg was NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware.61 In that case, the Supreme 
Court overturned civil judgments against black defendants who had organized 
a boycott of white-owned businesses in a Mississippi town in order to protest 
discrimination and advocate for racial equality.62 According to the lawsuit, one 
of the defendants, Charles Evers, had advocated the use of violence to enforce 
the boycott against unwilling participants.63 Plaintiffs argued that Evers’s 
advocacy of violence should make him liable to the plaintiffs for their losses 
resulting from the boycott.64 The Court disagreed, stating “[this] Court has 
made clear ... that mere advocacy of the use of force or violence does not 
remove speech from the protection of the First Amendment.”65 The Court 
specifically noted that Evers’s speech primarily consisted of a plea for black 
people to unify wherein strong language was used that might have been 
construed as advocacy of violence.66 While the Court noted that “a substantial 
question would be presented whether Evers could be held liable for the 
consequences of that unlawful conduct” had immediate violence erupted from 
his speech, any violence that occurred happened weeks later. 67 The Court 
therefore concluded that Evers’ speech was protected under the First 
Amendment. 
However, the Court has also found that First Amendment protection for 
speech related to illegal activity has its limits. In United States v. Williams, the 
Court upheld the constitutionality of a statute that outlawed knowing offers to 
provide or requests to receive child pornography.68 Citing Brandenburg, the 
Court noted that “there remains an important distinction between a proposal to 
engage in illegal activity and the abstract advocacy of illegality.”69 
Distinguishing the statute from one that would raise issues under 
Brandenburg, the Court found that it did not ban the advocacy of the creation 
of child pornography, but instead prohibited what were essentially attempts to 
give or receive it.70 Child pornography is not protected by the First 
Amendment.71 In Williams, the Court held that offers to give or receive it are 
also categorically excluded from First Amendment protection.72 For that 
reason, the Court found that the statute “[fell] well within constitutional 
bounds.”73 Because the Court found that the statute did not raise issues 
regarding permissible restrictions on the pure advocacy of violence or 
lawlessness, the precise boundaries of the Brandenburg standard remain 
unclear.

Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project 
 
Beyond the issue of regulating advocacy of imminent lawlessness or 
violence, the more recent 2010 case of Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project 
(“Humanitarian Law Project”) is also relevant to questions regarding the 
advocacy of terrorism, as the opinion analyzes the permissibility of burdening 
speech that may more generally benefit terrorist organizations. In 
Humanitarian Law Project, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of 
the federal criminal prohibition on the provision of material support to entities 
that have been officially designated as foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) 
by the United States.74 The criminal prohibition applies to, among other forms 
of support, the provision of “personnel,” “training,” “service,” and “expert 
advice and support” to designated entities.”75 
The plaintiffs in that case sought to provide certain services to FTOs, but 
feared that the provision of such services was barred by the law.76 While the 
plaintiffs did not claim that the statute violated the First Amendment in all 
instances, they alleged that the law was constitutionally invalid if applied to the 
assistance they contemplated providing the FTOs, which was intended to assist 
those groups’ legitimate, non-terrorism related activities.77 In particular, the 
plaintiffs sought pre-enforcement review in order to ensure that they could 
teach these organizations how to apply for certain humanitarian aid, engage in 
political advocacy on behalf of minority groups represented by these 
organizations, and give legal advice regarding the negotiation of peace 
agreements.78 
The Court agreed with the plaintiffs that the prohibition on the provision 
of material support extended not only to conduct, but also to speech in a 
manner that burdened the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights.79 The majority 
acknowledged that the restriction was content-based, and accordingly applied 
“a more demanding standard” of scrutiny to the provision than would 
otherwise have been employed if it reached only conduct.80 Nonetheless, the 
Court upheld the application of the statute to the speech in question. 
The Court’s assessment of the permissibility of the burden imposed on the 
plaintiffs’ speech rights was informed by its reading of the underlying statute. 
The Court construed the material support statute as having been “carefully 
drawn to cover only a narrow category of speech to, under the direction of, or 
in coordination with foreign groups that the speaker knows to be terrorist 
organizations.”81 The fact that the statute covered speech coordinated with 
foreign terrorist groups, and not “independent advocacy” that happened to 

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet 
9
support those groups, made it easier for the government to demonstrate that 
the restriction was narrowly tailored to advance the government’s interest.82 
Turning to the government’s justification, the Court began its analysis by 
reiterating that Congress has a compelling interest in combating terrorism and 
protecting national security.83 In banning the provision of all material support 
to foreign terrorist organizations, the Court observed that Congress had 
reasoned that any support provided to these organizations, even support not 
intended to aid in terrorist endeavors, can free resources to support terrorist 
activities.84 The Court noted congressional findings that if American citizens 
provided material support to entities the U.S. government had identified as 
terrorist groups that activity may strain diplomatic relationships between the 
United States and countries in which the FTOs operate.85 In the Court’s view, 
official cooperation and interaction with non-governmental entities can lend 
legitimacy to terrorist groups, which might undermine the government’s 
interest in combating those organizations.86 When examining the support that 
the plaintiffs wished to provide to FTOs, the Court observed that “[a] foreign 
terrorist organization introduced to the structures of the international legal 
system might use the information to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.”87 
According to the Court, prohibiting the provision of material support to FTOs, 
therefore, directly advanced the government’s compelling interest in 
combating terrorism, and because the prohibition applied only to material 
support coordinated with FTOs, the statute was narrowly tailored to achieve 
the government’s compelling interest. 
In reaching its conclusion upholding the statute, the Court emphasized that 
its holding applied only to the factual situation before the Court, and that the 
Court was not deciding the constitutionality of more difficult cases that might 
arise in other circumstances.88 The Court also stated that it “in no way 
suggest[ed] ... that a regulation of independent speech”—i.e., speech that is not 
coordinated with a FTO– “would pass constitutional muster, even if the 
Government were to show that such speech benefits foreign terrorist 
organizations” or that a similar statute banning the provision of material 
support to a domestic organization would survive review.89 The Court focused 
upon the significance of the fact that Congress had carefully crafted the statute 
to avoid burdening constitutional rights when enacting the law90 and 
emphasized that Congress’s views on matters of national security are entitled 
to “significant weight.”91

RESTRICTING THE ADVOCACY OF TERRORISM ON  
THE INTERNET 
 
Some have argued that it should be permissible to restrict advocacy of 
terrorism disseminated via the Internet under the First Amendment, including 
perhaps in situations where current case law suggests that significant 
constitutional questions might be raised.92 Such advocates contend that 
eliminating or restricting such speech from the digital environment will reduce 
the risk of “selfradicalization”93 and will restrict the ability of terrorist groups 
to use social media to spread their propaganda.94 
 
 
The Constitutionality of a Criminal Law that Would Wholly 
Prohibit Terrorist Advocacy 
 
Under Brandenburg, it appears that laws that criminalize the 
dissemination of the pure advocacy of terrorism, without more, would likely 
be deemed unconstitutional.95 Despite the ambiguities in its application, 
Brandenburg remains controlling precedent and has been cited by the Supreme 
Court as such.96 Consequently, speech that does no more than independently 
advocate the moral propriety or the moral good of terrorist acts is likely 
protected by the First Amendment.97 According to Brandenburg, statutes that 
fail to draw the distinction between abstract advocacy of violence and 
incitements directed at and likely to produce imminent lawless action sweep 
too broadly to be upheld.98 Therefore, any law that would generally restrict the 
independent advocacy of terrorist action on the Internet, without narrowing its 
application to only that advocacy that meets Brandenburg’s definition of 
incitement, would likely be unconstitutional. The limiting language in the 
Supreme Court’s majority opinion in Humanitarian Law Project appears to 
support this argument.99 The Court stressed that the application of the 
prohibition on material support to FTOs was properly tailored to withstand 
scrutiny, in part, because the statute did not apply to independent advocacy of 
terrorism.100 The Court stressed that it was not addressing whether Congress 
could burden independent advocacy, even if it could be shown that FTOs 
would benefit from that advocacy.101 
Some have argued that speech that advocates terrorist acts is so inherently 
dangerous that it should be distinguished from other speech that advocates 
violence or law breaking.102 These commentators posit that the government 

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet 
11
should be able to ban the dissemination of terrorist advocacy in the same way 
that the dissemination of child pornography is restricted.103 The comparison to 
child pornography is likely inapt, however. While the technology that permits 
the identification and filtering of child pornography might be adapted to filter 
the advocacy of terrorism,104 the constitutional justification for allowing the 
government to police the distribution of child pornography arguably does not 
justify treating the abstract advocacy of terrorism in a similar matter. 
Child pornography, the depiction of a minor engaged in sexual conduct 
that is not necessarily obscene, is unprotected by the First Amendment.105 The 
Supreme Court held that the possession and distribution of child pornography 
could be completely prohibited because the government has an overriding 
interest in destroying the market for speech that requires the injury and 
exploitation of children in order to create it.106 However, the Court has held 
that this reasoning does not extend to pornography that merely appears to, but 
does not in actuality depict a child engaging in sexual conduct (“virtual child 
pornography”).107 In reaching this holding, the Court explained that 
restrictions that apply to pornography depicting actual children were upheld 
because the laws targeted the production of the work and the harm that it 
caused children, not its content.108 In the case of virtual depictions of child 
pornography, no children are harmed in the creation of the content.109 The 
government had attempted to justify similar restrictions on virtual child 
pornography by arguing that such material, like actual child pornography, 
increased the risk that consumers of that content would victimize children in 
the future.110 Addressing that concern, the Supreme Court reiterated that the 
government “may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an 
unlawful act will be committed ‘at some indefinite future time.’”111 
Applying this reasoning to the advocacy of terrorist activity, it does not 
appear that the creation of speech that advocates terrorism always inherently 
harms someone in the course of its production in a way that would be similar 
to the creation of actual child pornography. To be sure, some terrorist 
propaganda depicts terrorist attacks or executions, but terrorist advocacy does 
not necessarily require someone to be harmed in order for the speech to 
occur.112 Instead, the advocacy of terrorism, like virtual child pornography, 
arguably creates or increases a risk that a crime will be committed “at some 
indefinite future time.”113 And the Supreme Court has held that the 
government may not prohibit speech solely on the basis of that indefinite 
risk.114

Can Terrorist Advocacy Be Restricted More Easily on  
the Internet? 
 
Speech that advocates terrorism that is distributed via the Internet may 
pose a significant danger to the public due to the ease of propagation to people 
who might be willing to act on those messages.115 For that reason, some 
lawmakers and scholars argue that courts should permit terrorist advocacy to 
be more easily restricted when the Internet is used to disseminate it.116 The 
Supreme Court has recognized that “each medium of expression presents 
special First Amendment problems.”117 For example, the Court has permitted 
broadcast speech to be more easily regulated than speech via other mediums 
because, among other factors, broadcasted speech is uniquely accessible to 
children.118 
The Supreme Court has yet to consider the specific question of whether 
the ease of dissemination of information over the Internet warrants treating 
advocacy of violence via that medium differently than the same speech 
communicated through other means. However, the Court has had the 
opportunity to examine what standard of review should be applied to 
restrictions on Internet speech more generally. 
In Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, the Supreme Court struck 
down restrictions on the communication of indecent speech to minors.119 In 
doing so, the Court held that content-based restrictions on Internet speech 
should be subject to strict scrutiny.120 The Court examined whether the 
medium of the Internet, like the broadcast medium, justified greater latitude 
for the government to restrict speech on that platform and concluded that it did 
not.121 Comparing the reasons for permitting greater restrictions on 
broadcasted speech to the medium of the Internet, the Court explained that 
broadcasted speech is uniquely accessible to children. Specifically, the Court 
noted that there is an appreciable risk that if indecent speech were broadcast at 
times when children would be likely to be in the audience, children might 
accidentally be exposed to that speech.122 In contrast, the risk of accidentally 
encountering indecent speech on the Internet was, in the Court’s assessment, 
far lower and did not justify departing from the general rules regarding 
content-based restrictions on speech.123 
The Court therefore accorded the highest degree of protection to speech on 
the Internet because “the interest in encouraging freedom of expression in a 
democratic society outweighs any theoretical but unproven benefit of 
censorship.”124 Assuming that the Court would apply the same reasoning to a 
content-based restriction on the advocacy of terrorism, the fact that speech is

distributed via the Internet would not seem to permit the government to more 
easily regulate its dissemination, under current case law. 
 
 
APPLICATION OF MATERIAL SUPPORT STATUTES  
TO ADVOCACY OF TERRORISM 
 
Under current law, the two federal statutes criminalizing material support 
for terrorism or foreign terrorist organizations, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2339A and 
2339B, appear most relevant to online advocacy of terrorism. Neither statute 
squarely prohibits the advocacy of terrorism. But both statutes potentially 
cover non-tangible forms of support for terrorist activities or foreign terrorist 
groups, including through the recruitment of personnel or the provision of 
training, expert advice or assistance, funding, or financial services.125 The 
material support statutes have been the most often prosecuted anti-terrorism 
offenses.126 Section 2339A of Title 18 of the United States Code prohibits the 
provision of material support with the knowledge or intent that the support be 
used to carry out a terrorist attack.127 Section 2339B prohibits the provision of 
material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations.128 As previously 
discussed, the Supreme Court in Humanitarian Law Project held that material 
support provided in the form of certain kinds of speech under the direction or 
in coordination with foreign terrorist organizations in violation of section 
2339B may be punished consistent with the First Amendment even if such 
support is for purposes other than advancing the group’s terrorist activities.129 
 
 
Section 2339A: Material Support of Acts of Terrorism 
 
Section 2339A of Title 18 of the U.S. Code prohibits: 
1. (a) attempting to, 
(b) conspiring to, or 
(c) actually 
2. (a) providing material support or resources, or (b) concealing or 
disguising 
I. 
the nature, 
II. 
location, 
III. 
source, or 
IV. 
ownership of material support or resources 

Kathleen Ann Ruane

3. knowing or intending that they be used 
(a) in preparation for, 
(b) in carrying out,  
(c) in preparation for concealment of an escape from, or 
(d) in carrying out the concealment of an escape from 
4. an offense identified as a federal crime of terrorism, as enumerated by 
the statute.130 
 
Material support or resources covers “any property, tangible or intangible, 
or service,”131 but excludes medicine and religious material.132 For the 
purposes of the discussion of whether the material support statutes can apply 
to the advocacy of terrorism, it is sufficient to note that the definition of 
material support explicitly includes “training” and “expert advice or 
assistance.”133 The statute defines training as the “instruction or teaching 
designed to impart a specific skill, as opposed to general knowledge,”134 
whereas expert advice and assistance is defined to mean “advice or assistance 
derived from scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.”135 Unlike 
the material support statute at issue in Humanitarian Law Project, which 
potentially applied to activities done in furtherance of a foreign entity’s 
activities unrelated to terrorism, a requisite for application of Section 2339A is 
that the support was given with the knowledge or intention that it would be 
used to facilitate a terrorist crime.136 
It seems that the provision of speech in the form of training or expert 
advice or assistance with the intent that it be used to support a specific act of 
terrorism can be constitutionally punished. Even when a violation of the law 
may take the form of speech, the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution 
is not necessarily a barrier to punishment.137 For example, an agreement to 
violate the law may be punished as a criminal conspiracy, and an agreement to 
fix prices in a market might constitute a violation of the antitrust laws. 138 
Constitutional challenges to the scope of Section 2339A, including those based 
on arguments that it is incompatible with the First Amendment, thus far have 
proven unsuccessful.139 
 
 
Section 2339B: Material Support of Designated  
Terrorist Organizations 
 
Section 2339B of Title 18 of the United States Code predicates liability on 
material support provided to certain designated terrorist organizations, rather 

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet 
15
than to the commission of a specific crime of terrorism.140 As acknowledged 
by the Supreme Court in Humanitarian Law Project, this difference may 
create closer constitutional questions when the statute is applied to speech.141 
Section 2339B outlaws: 
 
1. (a) attempting to provide, 
(b) conspiring to provide, or 
(c) actually providing 
2. material support or resources 
3. to a foreign terrorist organization 
4. knowing that the organization 
(a) has been designated a foreign terrorist organization, or 
(b) engages, or has engaged in “terrorism” or “terrorist activity.”142 
 
Section 2339B’s definition for “material support” is the same definition 
that applies to Section 2339A and covers “any property, tangible or intangible, 
or service” and explicitly includes “training” and “expert advice or 
assistance.”143 The Humanitarian Law Project Court clarified that advocacy 
may only constitute material support when it is “concerted activity,” i.e., 
activity in connection with or under the direction of an FTO.144 
To violate Section 2339B, one need not intend to aid in a terrorist attack 
or to further an organization’s terrorist activities.145 One need only have 
“knowledge that the organization is a designated terrorist organization ... that 
the organization has engaged in terrorist activity ... or that the organization has 
engaged or engages in terrorism.”146 
 
Advocacy Directed to, Coordinated with, Under the Direction of an FTO 
Assuming that a particular type of terrorist advocacy is within the scope of 
the “material support” proscribed by Section 2339B (e.g., it involves training 
or the giving of expert advice), the primary question that remains is whether 
the speech at issue would constitute advocacy “directed to, coordinated with or 
controlled by” a FTO.147 In examining the clarity of the statute in 
Humanitarian Law Project and holding that the statute was not impermissibly 
vague, the Court pointed out that, by its terms, 
 
[the] statute prohibits providing a service “to a foreign terrorist 
organization.” The use of the word “to” indicates a connection between 
the service and the foreign group. We think a person of ordinary 
intelligence would understand that independently advocating for a cause 

Kathleen Ann Ruane 
16
is different from providing a service to a group that is advocating for that 
cause.148 
 
However, the Court did acknowledge that it was leaving open “questions 
of exactly how much direction or coordination is necessary for an activity to 
constitute a ‘service.’”149 The majority decided that it would be more 
appropriate to address those questions when the particular factual situations 
arose.150 
A 2013 case decided by the First Circuit Court of Appeals may indicate 
that some courts could be inclined to broadly interpret what it means to direct 
speech to, coordinate with, or act under the direction of a FTO.151 In that case, 
Tarek Mehanna was convicted of several terrorism-related charges, including 
for providing material support to Al Qaeda, an organization Mehanna knew to 
be a designated FTO.152 Mehanna had traveled to Yemen in an attempt to join 
Al Qaeda, but had been unable to locate the training camp he sought.153 
Mehanna had also translated publicly available Arabic language documents, 
some of which were Al Qaeda-generated propaganda, into English and had 
posted his translations on a website that was sympathetic to Al Qaeda.154 
Mehanna argued that his translations were independent advocacy, protected by 
the First Amendment and that the jury had not been properly instructed 
regarding what it means to coordinate with an FTO under Section 2339B.155 
The First Circuit upheld his convictions. In doing so, the court examined 
the trial judge’s instructions to the jury regarding the First Amendment and the 
defendant’s translations. The First Circuit noted that the trial judge had defined 
“coordination” 
by 
explaining 
that 
“[i]ndividuals 
who 
act 
entirely 
independently of the ‘FTO’ to advance its goals or objectives shall not be 
considered to be working under the FTO’s direction.”156 The First Circuit 
could find no legal error with these jury instructions. In response to the 
contention that the jury should have been instructed that a direct connection 
between a FTO and a defendant must be proven in order for the defendant to 
have acted in coordination with the organization, the appeals court stated that 
neither the statute nor the Supreme Court’s decision in Humanitarian Law 
Project required “a direct link” between a defendant and a FTO for a violation 
to occur.157 Nonetheless, the appeals court did not explicitly hold that 
Mehanna’s translational activities were sufficient to sustain his conviction.158 
At the same time, the court held that, even if the defendant’s translational 
activities did not constitute an attempt to provide material support, the 
evidence surrounding his trip to Yemen in an attempt to join Al Qaeda 
supported his convictions.159 

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet 
17
The Mehanna case does not provide definitive answers as to when speech 
activity that may benefit an FTO is sufficiently directed to, coordinated with, 
or under the direction of a FTO to be considered material support.160 However, 
it does suggest that certain forms of speech-related activity might be 
considered to be material support, even if the defendant never actually has 
direct contact with the FTO.161 If speech can be material support when the 
defendant has never succeeded in making direct contact with the FTO, it 
seems unclear where the line might be drawn between independent advocacy 
of terrorism that the Supreme Court in Humanitarian Law Project suggested 
could not be restricted and advocacy of terrorism that constitutes a violation of 
Section 2339B .162 
 
The Application of Section 2339B to Social Media Services 
Some observers have suggested the possibility that when members of 
FTOs obtain accounts for social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, those 
sites are providing a service to FTOs that constitutes material support in 
violation of Section 2339B.163 Some FTOs have reportedly acquired social 
media accounts from social media companies.164 One recent study estimated 
that over 30,000 accounts on Twitter were controlled by the Islamic State 
organization alone as of 2014.165 Others have noted the apparent presence of 
other terrorist groups on Twitter and other social media outlets.166 The 
outstanding questions appear to be whether providing a social media account 
could constitute material support and whether a social media company has 
knowledge sufficient to support a conviction.167 However, it does not appear 
that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has ever brought a criminal or civil case 
against any social media outlet alleging such a violation.168 As a result, there is 
no case law clarifying whether the statute can properly be applied to social 
media companies whose generally available services are used by FTOs to 
communicate. 
If a court were to evaluate whether Section 2339B can be applied to social 
media companies, one of the most difficult questions presented would be 
whether a social media site could be said to be acting in coordination with or 
under the direction of an FTO. As noted above, Humanitarian Law Project did 
not provide guidance as to the level of coordination necessary to constitute the 
provision of a service to a FTO under the statute.169 Mehanna suggests that 
defendants need not have direct contact with the FTO in order for a violation 
to occur.170 Websites generally do not engage in background checks or any 
other form of verification prior to permitting an account to be created.171 
Given the number of people who use their services, such verification may be 

Kathleen Ann Ruane 
18
impossible.172 And given the difficult burden that would be imposed on social 
media companies in performing background checks on every user, a court may 
simply conclude that providing an account to a user who may happen to be 
affiliated with a FTOs may be insufficient in and of itself to rise to the level of 
“coordination” necessary to violate Section 2339B.173 Nonetheless, a number 
of social media sites have policies to remove terrorist content or the accounts 
of terrorist groups.174 Some have argued that because social media sites often 
fail to suspend accounts that are associated with FTOs, the government could 
argue that this failure is evidence of coordination with FTOs.175 Without case 
law interpreting this question, it remains unclear whether the fact that terrorist 
groups and their representatives often are able to obtain and use social media 
accounts represents a sufficient connection between social media services and 
the terrorist groups to support a finding of the provision of material support. 
In addition, in order to hold a social media company criminally or civilly 
liable for the provision of material support to an FTO under Section 2339B, 
the government must prove that the defendant knew that the organization to 
which the support was provided was a designated FTO or that the organization 
was engaged in terrorism.176 Social media companies could be expected to 
argue that they do not have sufficient knowledge of a new user’s affiliation 
with a FTO upon the activation of an account.177 Over one billion people use 
Facebook,178 and millions also use Twitter.179 The companies do not, and 
might argue that they cannot, attempt to discover with any degree of certainty 
what users of its services will be terrorist affiliates prior to the activation of an 
account.180 
Nonetheless, social media sites appear to be generally aware that their 
services are used by some percentage of their subscribers to disseminate 
terrorist advocacy and that they may be used by FTOs themselves. Twitter, 
Facebook, and other social media sites can and do disable accounts that violate 
their terms of service.181 Certain violent speech, including speech that 
advocates or glorifies terrorism, violates the terms of service of these sites.182 
It has been reported that Twitter has recently increased the number of accounts 
that it has disabled for promoting terrorism.183 Facebook has also reportedly 
removed posts that advocate terrorism and has disabled accounts for the same 
reason.184 The fact that social media companies take steps to remove that 
content when it appears on their services may be evidence that they know that 
their services are being used by FTOs.185 On the other hand, a social media 
website might not be sure if an account actually belongs to a FTO or is 
operated by another user identifying itself as the FTO. 186 It is unclear whether 
the general knowledge of social media sites that terrorist organizations are 

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet 
19
using their services, despite lacking actual knowledge that a particular account 
is used by a specific FTO, is sufficient to support a conviction for the 
provision of material support under Section 2339B.187 
 
Private Civil Lawsuits and Section 230 of the Communications  
Decency Act 
Section 2333 of Title 18 of the United States Code permits U.S. citizens 
injured in their persons, property, or business by acts of international terrorism 
to recover treble damages.188 Courts have interpreted violations of Section 
2339A and 2339B to be acts of international terrorism for the purposes of 
Section 2333.189 Recently, a number of lawsuits have been filed by private 
plaintiffs against social media websites alleging that they are providing 
material support to terrorist groups in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B.190 One 
such lawsuit was brought against Twitter and alleged that Twitter’s 
dissemination of propaganda by the Islamic State organization led to a terrorist 
attack that caused the death of three government contractors at a training 
facility in Jordan.191 In another lawsuit, the father of one of the Americans 
killed in the orchestrated terrorist attack in Paris in 2015 similarly accused 
Twitter, Google, and Facebook of providing material support to the Islamic 
State in violation of Section 2339B, arguing that without the services provided 
by these sites, “the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the 
most-feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible.”192 
Beyond the difficulty with determining whether social media companies 
can be held civilly liable for providing material support under the terms of 
Section 2339B, such private civil lawsuits may face an additional hurdle in 
attempting to hold social media services accountable for allowing FTOs to use 
them.193 Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) prohibits 
holding interactive computer service providers liable for content provided by 
third parties.194 While the liability shield does not apply to violations of the 
federal criminal law,195 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit recently 
held that, even when the civil lawsuit is based upon a violation of federal 
criminal law, Section 230’s shield may bar recovery if the lawsuit seeks to 
treat a service provider as a publisher.196 Consequently, even if social media 
service providers do violate Section 2339B when providing accounts to FTOs, 
it is possible that Section 230 of the CDA would shield them from civil 
liability for that violation. 
 
 
 

Kathleen Ann Ruane 
20
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 
Section 230(c)(1) of the CDA states, in pertinent part, that “no provider or 
user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or 
speaker of any information provided by another information content 
provider.”197 This language has been interpreted by courts to provide 
immunity from civil liability to providers and users of interactive computer 
services for content provided by third parties.198 In creating this liability 
shield, Congress sought to preserve the robust and vibrant communication that 
occurs on the Internet and to “keep government interference to a minimum.”199 
However, Section 230 is not an absolute bar to liability.200 
A three-part test has been developed to determine whether a defendant is 
eligible for Section 230’s protection. If the lawsuit is: 
 
1. brought against and interactive computer service provider or user 
(e.g., a website like NYTimes.com, or a social media service, like 
Twitter or Facebook),201 
2. based upon information provided by another content provider, and 
3. seeks to hold the defendant liable as a publisher or speaker of that 
content, 
 
then Section 230’s liability shield applies.202 If it can be shown that the 
interactive computer service provider contributed to the development of the 
illegal content, Section 230’s liability shield is not available.203 
To date, only one court has ruled with regard to section 230’s application 
to a lawsuit alleging material support of a FTO by a social media company. In 
Fields v. Twitter, the plaintiffs, family members of United States government 
contractors that were killed in a terrorist attack in Lebanon, alleged that the 
Islamic State organization used Twitter to spread propaganda, raise funds, and 
attract recruits, and that Twitter knowingly permitted such use of its 
services.204 The plaintiffs further alleged that Twitter’s provision of these 
services generally caused their injuries.205 However, the plaintiffs did not 
specifically allege that the Islamic State used Twitter to recruit the person who 
committed the terrorist attack that injured the plaintiffs or that Twitter was 
used to plan the attack.206 Instead, the plaintiffs alleged only that the attacker 
was generally inspired by propaganda that he had seen on Twitter.207 
The United States District Court for the Northern District of California 
dismissed the plaintiffs’ lawsuit, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their 
complaint.208 In doing so, the court did not reach the question of whether 
Twitter actually had provided material support to a foreign terrorist 

The Advocacy of Terrorism on the Internet 
21
organization. Instead, the district court dismissed the lawsuit because the court 
found that Section 230 of the CDA shielded Twitter from liability.209 
The central argument in Fields with regard to Section 230 was whether the 
lawsuit was attempting to hold Twitter liable as a publisher.210 To support their 
argument that the lawsuit was not targeting Twitter as a publisher, the plaintiffs 
offered two justifications. First, they argued that their lawsuit was not based 
upon the content of the speech disseminated by Twitter, but instead was based 
solely upon Twitter’s provision of services in the form of Twitter accounts to 
the Islamic State organization.211 Second, they alleged that because much of the 
organization’s recruiting communication is accomplished via Twitter’s Direct 
Messaging services, which are private communications between individual 
users, those direct messages are not “published” to the public and recovery 
based upon those communications cannot be barred by Section 230.212 The 
district court rejected both arguments. 
In rejecting the plaintiffs’ provision of accounts theory of liability, the 
court noted previous cases analyzing the breadth of Section 230’s liability 
shield have defined publishing broadly to include any decision related to what 
third-party content might be made available on a site or removed from it.213 
Generally, previous courts had applied that reasoning to specific offensive 
content and not to the decision of whether to provide access to a platform to 
specific persons.214 However, the district court did not see a substantive 
distinction between the two concepts for the purposes of whether Twitter was 
being treated as a publisher. In the court’s view, granting permission to a 
particular person to post whatever content that person liked was no less a 
publishing decision than allowing content to be posted in the first place, or 
removing content that the site decided violated its rules.215 “Twitter’s 
decisions to structure and operate itself as a platform ... allowing for the 
freedom of expression [of] hundreds of millions of people around the world 
and to allow even ISIS to sign up for accounts on its social network,” in the 
court’s view, “reflect choices about what [third-party] content can appear on 
Twitter and in what form.”216 These were quintessential publishing decisions 
in the view of the court. Consequently, Section 230’s liability shield 
applied.217 
Turning to whether content that was not made publicly available was 
published for the purposes of Section 230, the court again was not convinced by 
the plaintiffs’ arguments.218 In making this determination, the court noted that 
Section 230 was first enacted to provide a liability shield for defamatory content 
posted by third parties.219 Accordingly, the district court took into account that 
appeals courts have looked to defamation law when determining the scope of the 

Kathleen Ann Ruane 
22
shield provided by Section 230.220 Because, under defamation law, the term 
publication means to communicate to another person, other than the person 
defamed221 the Fields court determined that in order for an interactive service 
provider to be treated as a publisher for the purposes of Section 230, the third-
party content need not be made publicly available.222 Section 230’s liability 
shield therefore also applied to content communicated via Twitter’s Direct 
Messaging service. 
As noted above, similar private civil lawsuits alleging that social media 
sites provide material support to terrorist organizations are pending in court. It 
remains to be seen whether those cases will be decided similarly to Fields v. 
Twitter. However, Fields does suggest that reviewing courts may be inclined 
to continue the general trend of broadly applying the liability shield provided 
by Section 230 to civil suits brought against Internet platforms that display 
third-party content like Twitter, Facebook, and Google.223 If so, they may 
provide a barrier to attempts to curb the advocacy of terrorism on the Internet 
through civil litigation.

24 Ashcroft v. Am. Civ. Liberties Union, 535 U.S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
25 United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010). 
26 Id. (listing the traditionally recognized categories of speech that may be prohibited). 
27 For example, the government may place content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions on 
speech as long as such restrictions serve a significant interest and are narrowly tailored to 
directly advance that interest. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781 (1989). 
28 A law that restricted speech because of the subject matter discussed likely would be considered 
by a reviewing court to be a content-based restriction. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, ___ U.S. 

Kathleen Ann Ruane 
24
___, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 2227 (2015) (“Government regulation of speech is content based if a 
law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message 
expressed.”). 
29 Laws that single out speech expressing a particular viewpoint on a subject (e.g., negative views 
of a racial group) for special restriction are “viewpoint discriminatory” and a particularly 
egregious form of content discrimination. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of 
Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995) (finding that government discrimination among viewpoints is 
a “more blatant” and “egregious form of content discrimination”). 
30 Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 227. 
31 Sable Commc’n of Cali., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). 
32 Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, ___ U.S. ___, 135 S.Ct. 1656, 1666 (2015) (noting that it is the 
“rare case [] in which a speech restriction survives strict scrutiny”). 
33 See Ward, 491 U.S. at 797; United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968) (sustaining 
regulations that burden speech where the government interest in enacting the regulation is 
unrelated to the suppression of speech). 
34 Ward, 481 U.S. at 797 (“[E]ven in a public forum the government may impose reasonable 
restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided the restrictions are 
justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly 
tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample 
alternative channels for communication of the information.) (internal quotations omitted). 
35 Id. 
36 395 U.S. 444 (1969) (per curiam). Brandenburg overturned a previous decision, Whitney v. 
California, upholding California’s criminal syndicalism statute, which was similar in 
substance to the Ohio statute struck down by Brandenburg. 274 U.S. 357 (1927). In 
upholding the constitutionality of California’s statute, the Whitney Court gave great 
deference to the judgment of the state regarding the dangers presented by the speech at 
issue. Id. at 371. The state had declared that becoming a member of a group like the 
Communist Party “involves such danger to the public peace and the security of the state, 
that these acts should be penalized.” Id. The Court said that it would not declare such 
judgment to be unconstitutional unless it was “an arbitrary or unreasonable attempt to 
exercise the authority vested in the State in the public interest.” Id. Whitney was decided 
over forty years before Brandenburg, and the Brandenburg Court wrote that cases 
subsequent to Whitney had discredited the Court’s ruling in that case. 395 U.S. at 447. 
37 Brandenburg, 395 U.S. at 445. 
38 Id. 
39 Id. at 446. 
40 Id. at 448 (quoting Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290 (1961)). 
41 Id. 
42 See, e.g., Bible Believers v. Wayne Cty., 805 F.3d 228, 244 (6th Cir. 2015) (“The right to 
freedom of speech provides that a state cannot proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of 
law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent 
lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”) (internal quotations omitted); 
Blum v. Holder, 744 F.3d 790, 802 (1st Cir, 2014) (finding that the Animal Enterprise 
Terrorism Act did not apply to expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, 
including speech meeting Brandenburg’s standard); United States v. Bell, 414 F.3d 474 (3d 
Cir. 2005) (finding that, while speech meeting Brandenburg’s standard cannot be restricted, 
the speech at issue was false commercial speech that aided and abetted violations of the tax 
laws and, therefore, could be enjoined).

45 Id. at 448 n.2 (citing Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951), which had upheld the 
constitutionality of the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2385, which prohibits advocating the 
overthrow of the United States government, and Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298 
(1957), which overturned convictions under the Smith Act because the jury instructions had 
permitted punishment for pure advocacy “unrelated to its tendency to produce forcible 
action”).

38 WILLAMETTE L. REV. 1, 18-19 (2002) (“In Hess, the Court did appear to require that 
the interval between speech and called-for response must be quite brief.”); KENT 
GREENAWALT, SPEECH, CRIME, AND THE USES OF LANGUAGE, 209 (1989) 
(finding that Hess’s imminence interpretation was “very restrictive”). 
54 This interpretation coincides with the plain meaning of the word “imminent,” which generally 
means “close at hand in its incidence,” seemingly requiring an immediate risk of the 
occurrence of violence. Imminent, OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (2016)

92 Eckholm, supra note 14; Posner, supra note 20. 
93 Self-radicalization describes the process by which an individual, or group of individuals comes

Homeland After Killing Bin Laden: An Assessment: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on 
Homeland Security, 112th Cong. 12 (2011) (statement of Evan Kohlmann, Flashpoint 
Global Partners) (“We are seeing individuals who are popping up who were not recruited by

they see on the web.”). 
94 Eckholm, supra note 14 (“Recently, though, a few legal scholars, too, have engaged in what 
others call First Amendment heresy. What does clear and present danger mean when 
terrorists are provoking violence over the Internet? Should not the government have a way,

constitutional test for restricting such advocacy may need to be reconsidered). 
95 Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 448 (1969) (per curiam) (“A statute which fails to draw 
[the distinction between abstract teaching of the moral propriety of violence and preparing a 
group for action] impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the First and 
Fourteenth Amendments.”). 
96 See, e.g., United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010). (citing Brandenburg for the 
proposition that “incitement” is not protected by the First Amendment).

(“We 
Americans 
must have the right to try to persuade our fellow citizens, and our government, that our 
government is on the wrong side in various foreign policy controversies, that groups that the 
government says are bad guys are actually good guys (or at least less bad than the really bad 
guys), or that we should change our policies about which kinds of support to the bad guys 
are barred and which are allowed. To do that, we need to be able to make arguments 
defending or even praising those groups, even when such arguments help designated foreign 
terrorist organizations ... ”) (emphasis in original).

Congress has avoided any restriction on independent advocacy, or indeed any activities not 
directed to, coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist groups.”) (emphasis in 
original). 
101 Id. at 39. See also, Volokh, supra note 99 (“To be sure, the majority doesn’t hold that a ban on 
independent advocacy would be unconstitutional even though such a ban might be 
necessary to serve a compelling government interest; it expressly reserves that question. But 
I think that the majority’s repeated stress that the law doesn’t restrict independent advocacy 
suggests that the Court would indeed strike down such a ban that applied to independent 
advocacy.”).

201 An interactive computer service is defined by section 230 as “any information service, system, 
or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a 
computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the 
Internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or educational 
institutions.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2). This definition has been held by courts broadly to 
encompass websites, such as Backpage.com or Facebook, internet service providers, such as 
Verizon or Comcast, and all other types of computer services that provide a neutral platform 
for users of the service to communicate via the Internet. See, e.g., Dirty World, 755 F.3d at 
407 (“These providers include broadband providers, hosting companies, and website 
operators like Dirty World and Richie.”); Backpage.com v. Hoffman, No. 13-cv-03952,

Backpage.com, 817 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2016), plaintiffs had argued that Backpage.com was 
liable to them for violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act because 
it had hosted advertisements whereby the plaintiffs were trafficked in violation of the 
statute. Id. at 15. The First Circuit held that Section 230(c)’s liability shield barred recovery 
because it “extends to the formulation of precisely the sort of website policies and 
practices” at issue in the case. Id. at 20. “Features such as these, which reflect choices about 
what content can appear on the website and in what form, are editorial choices that fall 
within the purview of traditional publisher functions.” Id. at 21. 
216 Fields, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105768, at *20 (internal citations and quotations omitted). 
217 The court also found two further deficiencies in the plaintiffs’ argument that seeking to hold 
Twitter liable for providing accounts to FTOs was not an attempt to hold Twitter liable as a 
publisher. Id. at *13. First, the court found that much of the plaintiffs’ complaint focused on 
content posted to Twitter by the Islamic State organization. Id. “In short, the theory of 
liability ... is not that Twitter provides material support to ISIS by providing it with Twitter

accounts, but that Twitter does so by ‘knowingly permitt[ing] [ISIS] to use [those accounts] 
as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda ... ” which essentially sought to hold Twitter 
liable for content it published. Id. *16-*17. Furthermore, plaintiffs had not properly alleged 
causation. Id. at *22 (“[The] allegations in the [complaint] do not support a plausible 
inference of proximate causation between Twitter’s provision of accounts to ISIS and the 
deaths of Fields and Creach.”). 
218 Id. at *26. 
219 Id. (“As noted above, Congress enacted section 230(c)(1) in part to respond to a New York

222 Id. The district court also noted a number of other cases where Section 230 was held to bar 
recovery for claims based upon the transmission of third-party content that was nonpublic 
and in which the courts did not question whether the content could be said to have been 
“published.” Id. at *28 (citing Hung Tan Phan v. Lang Van Pham, 182 Cal. App. 4th 323,

TERRORIST MATERIAL SUPPORT:  
AN OVERVIEW OF 18 U.S.C. 2339A  
AND 2339B 
 
 
Charles Doyle 
 
 
SUMMARY 
 
The material support statutes, 18 U.S.C. 2339A and 2339B, have 
been among the most frequently prosecuted federal anti-terrorism 
statutes. Section 2339A outlaws: 
 
(1)(a) attempting to, 
(b) conspiring to, or 
(c)actually 
(2)(a) providing material support or resources, or  
(b) concealing or disguising 
i. the nature, 
ii. location, 
iii. source, or 
iv. ownership 
v. of material support or resources 
(3) knowing or intending that they be used 
(a) in preparation for, 
                                                           
 This is an edited, reformatted and augmented version of a Congressional Research Service 
publication, R41333, dated July 19, 2010.

(b) in carrying out, 
(c) in preparation for concealment of an escape from, or 
in carrying out the concealment of an escape from 
(4) an offense identified as a federal crime of terrorism. 
 
Section 2339B outlaws: 
(1)(a) attempting to provide, 
(b) conspiring to provide, or 
(c) actually providing 
(2) material support or resources 
(3) to a foreign terrorist organization 
(4) knowing that the organization 
(a) has been designated a foreign terrorist organization, or 
(b) engages, or has engaged, in “terrorism” or “terrorist activity.” 
 
The sections use a common definition for the term “material support 
or resources:” any service or tangible or intangible property. The 
Supreme Court recently held that the forms of material support in the 
challenge before it were not unconstitutionally vague nor was their 
proscription inconsistent with the First Amendment’s freedom of speech 
and freedom of association requirements. Violations of either section are 
punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years. Although neither 
section creates a civil cause of action for victims, treble damages and 
attorneys fees may be available for some victims under 18 U.S.C. 2333. 
Section 2339B has two extraterritorial jurisdiction provisions. One is 
general (there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over an offense under this 
section) and the other descriptive (there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over 
an offender under this section if the offender is a U.S. national, etc.). 
Section 2339A has no such provisions, but is likely applicable at a 
minimum when an offender or victim is a U.S. national; the offense has 
an impact in the United States; the offense is committed against U.S. 
national interests; or the offense is universally condemned. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The two federal material support statutes have been at the heart of the 
Justice Department’s terrorist prosecution efforts.1 One provision outlaws 
providing material support for the commission of certain designated offenses 
that might be committed by terrorists, 18 U.S.C. 2339A.2 The other outlaws 
providing material support to certain designated terrorist organizations, 18 
U.S.C. 2339B. They share a common definition of the term “material support,” 
some aspects of which have recently come under constitutional attack. 

Terrorist Material Support 
37
BACKGROUND 
 
Since their inception in the mid-1990s, Congress has periodically 
expanded and sought to clarify the scope of sections 2339A and 2339B. It 
enacted Section 2339A with little fanfare as part of a wide-ranging crime 
package, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.3 
Almost immediately thereafter, Congress amended Section 2339A and 
supplemented it with Section 2339B as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective 
Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).4 As the House committee report 
explained it, new Section 2339B reflects a recognition of 
 
the fungibility of financial resources and other types of material 
support. Allowing an individual to supply funds, goods, or services to an 
organization, or to any of its subgroups, that draw significant funding 
from the main organization’s treasury, helps defray the costs to the 
terrorist organization of running the ostensibly legitimate activities. This 
in turn frees an equal sum that can then be spent on terrorist activities.5 
 
The USA PATRIOT Act amended both sections, increasing the maximum 
term of imprisonment from 10 to 15 years (and to life imprisonment when 
commission of the offense resulted in death); adding “expert advice or 
assistance” to forms of proscribed material support or resources; and 
subjecting attempts and conspiracies to violate Section 2339A to the same 
maximum penalties as the substantive violation of the section.6 
The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended 
the definition of “material support or resources” that applies to both sections.7 
The specific forms of support that had been used to define the term became 
examples of a more general definition which covers “any property, tangible or 
intangible, or service,” 18 U.S.C. 2339A(b)(1). Clarifying definitions of the 
examples “training” and “expert advice or assistance,” were added, as was a 
clarifying explanation of the term “personnel” as used in Section 2339B, 18 
U.S.C. 2339A(b)(2), (3), 2339B(h). At the same time, the predicate offense list 
of Section 2339A was expanded to cover any of the federal crimes of 
terrorism, 18 U.S.C. 2339A(a).

SUPPORT OF DESIGNATED TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS (18 U.S.C. 2339B) 
 
In its present form, Section 2339B outlaws: 
(1)(a) attempting to provide, 
(b) conspiring to provide, or 
(c) actually providing 
(2) material support or resources 
(3) to a foreign terrorist organization 
(4) knowing that the organization 
(a) has been designated a foreign terrorist organization, or 
(b) engages, or has engaged, in “terrorism” or “terrorist activity.” 
 
 
Attempt, Conspiracy, Aiding and Abetting 
 
Attempt is the unfulfilled commission of an underlying offense. If the 
attempt is successful, the offender cannot be prosecuted or punished for both 
the completed offense and the attempt to commit it.8 Attempt has two 
elements: (1) an intent to commit the underlying offense; and (2) some 
substantial step towards its completion.9 Mere preparation is not enough.10 “To 
constitute a substantial step, a defendant’s actions must cross the line between 
preparation and attempt by unequivocally demonstrating that the crime will 
take place unless interrupted by independent circumstances.”11 It is no defense 
that, unbeknownst to the defendant, commission of the underlying offense was 
impossible, as for example because he was dealing with government 
undercover agents rather than agents of a foreign terrorist organization.12 An 
attempt to provide material support in violation of Section 2339B and actually 
providing such assistance are punished the same: imprisonment for not more 
than 15 years (for any term of years or life, if death results from the 
commission of the offense), and/or a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more 
than $500,000 for an organization)(or not more than twice the amount of gain 
or loss associated with the offense).13 
Conspiracy to provide material support in violation of Section 2339B is 
the agreement to provide such support.14 The offense is complete upon assent; 
the support need only be planned, not delivered.15 Moreover, each of the 
conspirators is liable not only for the conspiracy, but for any other foreseeable 
offense committed by any of the conspirators in furtherance of the overall 

Terrorist Material Support 
39
scheme.16 Like attempt, conspiracy to provide material support carries the 
same penalties as the completed substantive offense: imprisonment for not 
more than 15 years (for any term of years or life, if death results from the 
commission of the offense), and/or a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more 
than $500,000 for an organization)(or not more than twice the amount of gain 
or loss associated with the offense).17 Unlike attempt, conspirators may be 
punished for both conspiracy and for actually providing material support 
should their scheme succeed.18 
Under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 2, anyone who counsels, procures, aids, 
or abets a violation of Section 2339B or any other federal crime is punishable 
as though he had committed the offense himself. “In order to aid and abet 
another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in some sort 
associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that 
he wishes to bring about, [and] that he seek by his action to make it 
succeed.”19 “Typically, the same evidence will support both a conspiracy and 
an aiding and abetting conviction.”20 Unlike conspiracy, however, liability 
under section 2 only attaches if someone else commits the substantive 
offense.21 
 
 
Material Support 
 
The precise scope of the term “material support or resources” for purposes 
of Section 2339B proved controversial almost from the beginning. The section 
uses the definition found in Section 2339A(b) and thus covers “any property, 
tangible or intangible, or service,” 18 U.S.C. 2339B(g)(4). The term excludes 
medicine and religious materials, but includes 
 
 
currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, 
 
financial services, 
 
lodging, 
 
training (i.e., instruction or teaching designed to impart a specific 
skill, as opposed to general knowledge), 
 
expert advice or assistance (i.e., advice or assistance derived from 
scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge), 
 
safehouses, 
 
false documentation or identification, 
 
communications equipment, facilities, 

Charles Doyle 
40
 
weapons, 
 
lethal substances, 
 
explosives, 
 
personnel (one or more individuals who may be or include oneself), 
and 
 
transportation.22 
 
Section 2339B also has a more explicit description of personnel covered 
by its proscription, which confines the term to those provided to a foreign 
terrorist organization to direct its activities or to work under its direction or 
control.23 
Shortly after the creation of Section 2339B, groups seeking to support the 
nonviolent activities of two designated terrorist organizations sought to enjoin 
enforcement against them.24 Among other things, they argued that prohibitions 
against providing “personnel” or “training” were unconstitutionally vague and 
might extend to things like advocating the organizations’ interests before the 
U.N. Commission on Human Rights, petitioning Members of Congress on 
their behalf, seeking the release of political prisoners, or training the 
organizations’ members on the use of international law to resolve political 
disputes peacefully.25 The district court concluded that they demonstrated 
sufficient likelihood of the success on the merits to warrant issuance of a 
preliminary injunction.26 The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed.27 
When Congress amended the definition of material support in the USA 
PATRIOT Act to include the provision of “expert advice or assistance” to 
designated terrorist organizations,28 the groups again sought to enjoin 
enforcement.29 Again, the district court agreed the term was unconstitutionally 
vague, noting that “like the terms ‘personnel’ and ‘training,’ ‘expert advice 
and assistance’ could be construed to include unequivocally pure speech and 
advocacy protected by the First Amendment or to encompass First 
Amendment protected activities.”30 
Then Congress sought to clarify the definition in the Intelligence Reform 
and Terrorism Protection Act.31 It recast the definition into its current form, 
with explanatory additions for the terms “personnel,” “training,” and “expert 
advice or assistance.”32 The Ninth Circuit vacated its earlier decisions and 
returned the case to the district court for further consideration in light of the 
amendments.33 
The statute fared only slightly better on remand. The district court felt the 
amendments clarified the term “personnel” so that it was no longer 
unconstitutionally vague, but the amendments did not cure the defects it had 

Terrorist Material Support 
41
previously seen in the terms “training” and “expert advice or assistance,” a 
defect compounded by the introduction of the term “service” into the 
definition.34 
The Ninth Circuit again agreed.35 “[L]imiting the definition of the term 
‘training’ to the ‘imparting of skills’ does not cure unconstitutional vagueness 
because, so defined, the term ‘training’ could still be read to encompass speech 
and advocacy protected by the First Amendment.”36 As for “expert advice or 
assistance,” the Court noted that “[a]t oral argument, the government stated 
that filing an amicus brief in support of a foreign terrorist organization would 
violate AEDPA’s prohibition against providing ‘expert advice or assistance.’ 
Because the ‘other specialized knowledge’ portion of the ban on providing 
‘expert advice or assistance’ continues to cover constitutionally protected 
advocacy, we hold that it is void for vagueness.”37 Finally, like the district 
court, the Ninth Circuit found the term “service” unconstitutionally vague 
“because the statute defines ‘service’ to include ‘training’ or ‘expert advice or 
assistance,’ and because it is easy to imagine protected expression that falls 
within the bounds’ of the term ‘service.’”38 
Vagueness challenges by defendants in other federal courts were largely 
unsuccessful, primarily either because the support involved clearly fell within 
the definition of proscribed personnel or expert advice or assistance,39 or 
because the support involved money or some type of support other than 
personnel, training, or expert advice or assistance.40 On September 30, 2009, 
the Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit’s decision.41 
On June 21, 2010, the Supreme Court reversed.42 It found that the Ninth 
Circuit had inappropriately merged vagueness and First Amendment 
concerns.43 Section 2339B survived scrutiny under each of those challenges 
when considered separately.44 A statute is impermissibly vague when “it fails 
to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or 
is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory 
enforcement.”45 When a statute is clearly applicable to the conduct at issue, it 
is to no avail that its application may be unclear under other circumstances.46 
The Court held that Section 2339B is not unconstitutionally vague as 
applied to the type of support at issue—coordinated advocacy on behalf of a 
terrorist organization and training such organization’s members to use 
international law to resolve disputes and to petition the United Nations and other 
similar entities for relief.47 A reasonable person would realize that such training 
constitutes providing “expert advice or assistance ... derived from ... specialized 
knowledge,” and that such advocacy, when coordinated or directed by a terrorist 
organization, constitutes providing a service to such an organization.48 

Charles Doyle 
42
As for free speech, Congress may outlaw material support to a terrorist 
organization in the form of speech of the type at issue without offending the 
First Amendment. The government has a compelling interest in the 
suppression of terrorism. Training and coordinated support in the form of 
advocacy of a terrorist organization’s lawful activities frees resources to 
service illicit activities; lends legitimacy to the organization; and may strain 
diplomatic relations with the countries against whom the organization’s 
terrorist activities may be directed.49 In the case at hand, “[a] foreign terrorist 
organization introduced to the structures of the international legal system 
might use the information to threaten, manipulate, and disrupt.”50 An 
organization guide to and through the avenues to international relief might 
secure relief in the form of fungible monetary aid.51 
Finally, the Court confirmed rejection of the group’s freedom of 
association argument; the section outlaws conduct, not membership.52 
 
 
Other Constitutional Challenges 
 
The constitutional challenges of Section 2339B on other grounds have 
been rejected in virtually every instance. 
 
Overbreadth 
At first glance, if various forms of “material support” are considered 
vague because they sweep in both protected and unprotected speech, then it 
would seem they should be considered overly broad for the same reason. It is 
true that a “showing that a law punishes a ‘substantial’ amount of protected 
free speech, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep, 
suffices to invalidate all enforcement of that law.”53 The Supreme Court 
emphasized in Virginia v. Hicks, however, that a challenged statute’s 
“application to protected speech must be ‘substantial’ not only in an absolute 
sense, but also relative to the scope of the law’s plainly legitimate applications, 
before applying the strong medicine of overbreadth invalidation.”54 
The Ninth Circuit and each of the other courts to consider the issue have 
agreed that the various forms of proscribed material support do not include a 
substantial amount of protected speech when compared to the amount of 
unprotected speech and conduct which the terms legitimately reach.55 
 

Terrorist Material Support 
43
Due Process 
Closely related to the First Amendment freedom of association argument 
is a due process “absence of guilty intent” argument. The Supreme Court has 
said that due process restricts the extent to which the sins of an organization 
may be attributed to its members.56 Due process, however, permits punishment 
“when the statute is found to reach only ‘active’ members having also a guilty 
knowledge and intent ... which therefore prevents a conviction on what 
otherwise might be regarded as merely an expression of sympathy with the 
alleged criminal enterprise, unaccompanied by any significant action in its 
support or any commitment to undertake such action.”57 
Some have argued that this means either that due process renders Section 
2339B inoperable or that conviction is only possible when the accused knew 
and intended that his support would be used for the unlawful purposes of the 
designated terrorist organization.58 By and large, the courts have found the 
argument unpersuasive. Some do so because Section 2339B punishes conduct, 
not mere membership.59 Others do so because the section requires knowledge 
that the accused either knew the beneficiary was a designated terrorist 
organization or knew that it engaged in terrorism. 
This, they believe, “satisfies the requirement of ‘personal guilty’ and 
eliminates any due process concerns.”60 
Finally, Section 2339B defendants suffer no due process deprivation 
simply because they may not challenge the terrorist designation of their 
beneficiary.61 
 
 
Terrorist Organizations 
 
Providing material support is only a crime under 2339B if the known 
beneficiary is a foreign terrorist organization. That is, the government must 
show either that (1) the defendant knows that the organization has been 
designated a foreign terrorist organization or (2) the defendant knows that the 
organization is or has engaged in “terrorism” or in “terrorist activities.” 
 
Designated Terrorist Organizations 
The process under which the Secretary of State designates an entity a 
foreign terrorist organization is authorized in Section 219 of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1189. Under the procedure, an organization may 
challenge its designation, 8 U.S.C. 1189(a)(4)(B), and the Secretary may 
revoke the designation, 8 U.S.C. 1189(a)(6). The organization may appeal the 

Charles Doyle 
44
Secretary’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia, 8 U.S.C. 1189(c). A defendant, charged with providing material 
support to an organization, however, may not challenge the designation.62 
 
Organizations Engaged in Terrorism or Terrorist Activities 
Organizations that the accused knew engaged in “terrorism” or “engaged 
in terrorist activities” constitute a second class of banned beneficiaries. 
“Terrorism” for purposes of Section 2339B is simply “premeditated, 
politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by 
subnational groups or clandestine agents.”63 
The definition of an organization that “engages in terrorist activities” is 
more multi-faceted. For such purposes of Section 2339B, “the term ‘engage in 
terrorist activity’ means, in an individual capacity or as a member of an 
organization— 
(I) to commit or to incite to commit, under circumstances indicating an 
intention to cause death or serious bodily injury, a terrorist activity; 
(II) to prepare or plan a terrorist activity; 
(III) to gather information on potential targets for terrorist activity; 
(IV) to solicit funds or other things of value for -  
(aa) a terrorist activity;  
(bb) a terrorist organization described in clause (vi)(I) or (vi)(II); or 
(cc) a terrorist organization described in clause (vi)(III), unless the 
solicitor can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not 
know, and should not reasonably have known, that the organization was a 
terrorist organization; 
(V) to solicit any individual— 
(aa) to engage in conduct otherwise described in this subsection; 
(bb) for membership in a terrorist organization described in clause 
(vi)(I) or (vi)(II); or 
(cc) for membership in a terrorist organization described in clause 
(vi)(III) unless the solicitor can demonstrate by clear and convincing 
evidence that he did not know, and should not reasonably have known, 
that the organization was a terrorist organization; or 
(VI) to commit an act that the actor knows, or reasonably should know, 
affords 
material 
support, 
including 
a 
safe 
house, 
transportation, 
communications, funds, transfer of funds or other material financial benefit, 
false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical, 
biological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training— 
(aa) for the commission of a terrorist activity; 

Terrorist Material Support 
45
(bb) to any individual who the actor knows, or reasonably should 
know, has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity; 
(cc) to a terrorist organization described in subclause (I) or (II) of 
clause (vi) or to any member of such an organization; or 
(dd) to a terrorist organization described in clause (vi)(III), or to any 
member of such an organization, unless the actor can demonstrate by 
clear and convincing evidence that the actor did not know, and should 
not reasonably have known, that the organization was a terrorist 
organization.”64 
 
In the Immigration and Nationality Act, and thus for purposes of Section 
2339B, “the term ‘terrorist activity’ means any activity which is unlawful 
under the laws of the place where it is committed (or which, if it had been 
committed in the United States, would be unlawful under the laws of the 
United States or any State) and which involves any of the following: 
 
(I) The highjacking or sabotage of any conveyance (including an aircraft, 
vessel, or vehicle). 
(II) The seizing or detaining, and threatening to kill, injure, or continue to 
detain, another individual in order to compel a third person (including a 
governmental organization) to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit 
or implicit condition for the release of the individual seized or detained. 
(III) A violent attack upon an internationally protected person (as defined 
in Section 1116(b)(4) of Title 18) or upon the liberty of such a person. 
(IV) An assassination. 
(V) The use of any— 
(a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or 
(b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other 
than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, 
directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause 
substantial damage to property. 
(VI) A threat, attempt, or conspiracy to do any of the foregoing.”65 
 
 
Consequences of Charge or Conviction 
 
Conviction for a violation of Section 2339B is punishable by 
imprisonment for not more than 15 years (for any period of years or for life if 
death results from commission of the offense) and/or a fine of not more than 

Charles Doyle 
46
$250,000 (not more than $500,000 for an organizational defendant). Strictly 
speaking, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines are not binding. Yet, they are an 
indispensible part any sentencing decision.66 The Sentencing Guidelines 
contain a special terrorism enhancement that, if it applies, can have the effect 
of requiring a sentence at the statutory maximum, because it calls for a 
minimum sentencing range that exceeds the statutory maximum of 15 years. 
The terrorism enhancement Guideline, Section 3A1.4, establishes a minimum 
offense level of 32 with a criminal history category of VI for a felony offense 
that “involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism.” The 
Guideline sentencing range of a crime with an offense level of 32 and a 
criminal history category of VI is 210 to 262 months (17.5 to 21.8 years) 
imprisonment.67 Since the maximum term of imprisonment for violations of 
Section 2339B is 15 years and since a Sentencing Guideline sentence may not 
exceed the statutory maximum, the Guidelines call for a court to impose the 
statutory maximum.68 
The application of the terrorism Guideline requires either that the offense 
of conviction constitutes a federal crime of terrorism or that the offense of 
conviction was intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism.69 An offense 
qualifies as a federal crime of terrorism if it satisfies two conditions.70 The 
crime must be one listed as a federal crime of terrorism in 18 U.S.C. 
2332b(g)(5)(B). Section 2339B is listed. Second, the crime must be 
“calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or 
coercion, 
or 
to 
retaliate 
against 
government 
action,” 
18 
U.S.C. 
2332b(g)(5)(A). 
 
Federal Crime of Terrorism 
Classification as a federal crime of terrorism has several other 
consequences. Property derived from or used in the commission of such an 
offense is subject to confiscation, 18 U.S.C. 981(a)(1)(G). Federal crimes of 
terrorism are by definition predicate offenses for purposes of federal money 
laundering and RICO prosecutions.71 Prosecution of a Section 2339B offense 
is subject to an eight-year statute of limitations, rather than the general five-
year period.72 An accused charged with a violation of a federal crime of 
terrorism faces an enhanced prospect of pre-trial detention.73 A defendant 
convicted for violation of a federal crime of terrorism may be subject to a life-
time term of supervised release, rather than the general five-year maximum 
term.74 
 
 

Terrorist Material Support

Extraterritorial Jurisdiction 
 
As a general rule, U.S criminal law is territorial, unless Congress indicates 
otherwise.75 Congress has used one of two methods to signal overseas 
application of a criminal statute. In some instances, it states in general terms 
that a particular statute will have extraterritorial application.76 In others, it 
describes the circumstances under which a criminal proscription will have 
extraterritorial application.77 
A general declaration of overseas application relies upon the principles of 
international law under which a claim of extraterritorial jurisdiction might be 
recognized. Those principles are usually referred to as: 
 
 
the territorial principle (crimes that occur in or have an effect in a 
country’s territory); 
 
the nationality principle (crimes committed by a country’s nationals); 
 
the passive personality principle (crimes committed against a 
country’s nationals); 
 
the protective principle (crimes that have an impact on a country’s 
national interests); and 
 
the universal principle (crimes which are universally condemned).78 
 
Section 2339B has both a descriptive and a general statement of 
extraterritorial jurisdiction. The general statement declares, “There is 
extraterritorial Federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section,” 18 
U.S.C. 2339B(d)(2). The descriptive statement provides, “There is jurisdiction 
over an offense under subsection (a) if— 
 
A. an offender is a national of the United States ... or an alien lawfully 
admitted for permanent residence in the United States ... ; 
B. an offender is a stateless person whose habitual residence is in the 
United States; 
C. after the conduct required for the offense occurs an offender is 
brought into or found in the United States, even if the conduct 
required for the offense occurs outside the United States; 
D. the offense occurs in whole or in part within the United States; 
E. the offense occurs in or affects [U.S.] interstate or foreign commerce; 
or 
F. an offender aids or abets any person over whom jurisdiction exists 
under this paragraph in committing an offense under subsection (a) or 

Charles Doyle 
48
conspires with any person over whom jurisdiction exists under this 
paragraph to commit an offense under subsection (a),” 18 U.S.C. 
2339B(d)(1). 
 
The general statement has been part of the section since its inception.79 
The descriptive statement appeared as part of the Intelligence Reform and 
Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.80 The legislative history of the 2004 act 
provides no explanation of why the apparently overlapping descriptive 
statement was thought necessary.81 Had the general statement been dropped at 
the time, it would be clear Congress intended extraterritorial application to be 
confined to situations found in the descriptive statement. The inclusion of both 
suggests Congress intended extraterritorial application in any situation that 
falls within either provision. 
 
 
Civil Actions 
 
Section 2339B(c) authorizes the Attorney General or the Secretary of the 
Treasury to bring a civil suit in district court to enjoin violation of the section. 
Although neither Section 2339B nor Section 2339A creates a private civil 
cause of action, 18 U.S.C. 2333 authorizes such suits for those injured in their 
person, property, or business by an act of international terrorism.82 The courts 
have concluded that the violations of sections 2339A or 2339B may constitute 
“acts of international terrorism” for purposes of Section 2333.83 They do so by 
construing violations of Section 2339A or 2339B as acts of “international 
terrorism” as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331(1).84 
 
Reporting Requirements 
Section 2339B(a)(2) requires financial institutions to report assets held for 
a foreign terrorist organization to the Secretary of the Treasury. Failure to do 
so subjects the institution to a civil penalty of the greater of $50,000 or twice 
the value of the assets involved, 18 U.S.C. 2339B(b). 
 
Protection of Classified Information 
Section 2339B(f) establishes a procedure for the protection of classified 
information during the course of civil proceedings, complete with authority for 
interlocutory appeals by the government. 

Terrorist Material Support 
49
SUPPORT OF TERRORISM (18 U.S.C. 2339A) 
 
Where Section 2339B outlaws support of terrorist organizations, Section 
2339A outlaws support for the crimes a terrorist has committed or may be 
planning to commit. Section 2339B designates terrorist organizations; Section 
2339A designates terrorist crimes. More precisely, Section 2339A outlaws: 
 
(1)(a) attempting to, 
(b) conspiring to, or 
(c) actually 
(2)(a) providing material support or resources, or  
(b) concealing or disguising 
i. the nature, 
ii. location, 
iii. source, or 
iv. ownership of material support or resources 
(3) knowing or intending that they be used 
(a) in preparation for, 
(b) in carrying out, 
(c) in preparation for concealment of an escape from, or 
(d) in carrying out the concealment of an escape from 
(4) an offense identified as a federal crime of terrorism.85 
 
 
Attempt, Conspiracy, and Aiding and Abetting 
 
The law of attempt, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting is the same for 
sections 2339A and 2339B. As we said of Section 2339B, in the case of 
Section 2339A, attempt is the unfulfilled commission of an underlying 
offense. If the attempt is successful, the offender cannot be prosecuted or 
punished for both the completed offense and the attempt to commit it.86 
Attempt has two elements: (1) an intent to commit the underlying offense; and 
(2) some substantial step towards its completion.87 Mere preparation is not 
enough.88 “To constitute a substantial step, a defendant’s actions must cross 
the line between preparation and attempt by unequivocally demonstrating that 
the crime will take place unless interrupted by independent circumstances.”89 It 
is no defense that, unbeknownst to the defendant, commission of the 
underlying offense was impossible, as for example because he was dealing 
with government undercover agents rather than agents of a foreign terrorist 

Charles Doyle 
50
organization.90 An attempt to provide material support in violation of Section 
2339B and actually providing such assistance are punished the same: 
imprisonment for not more than 15 years (for any term of years or life, if death 
results from the commission of the offense), and/or a fine of not more than 
$250,000 (not more than $500,000 for an organization)(or not more than twice 
the amount of gain or loss associated with the offense).91 
Conspiracy to provide material support in violation of Section 2339B is 
the agreement to provide such support.92 The offense is complete upon assent; 
the support need only be planned, not delivered.93 Moreover, each of the 
conspirators is liable not only for the conspiracy, but for any other foreseeable 
offense committed by any of the conspirators in furtherance of the overall 
scheme.94 Like attempt, conspiracy to provide material support carries the 
same penalties as the completed substantive offense: imprisonment for not 
more than 15 years (for any term of years or life, if death results from the 
commission of the offense), and/or a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more 
than $500,000 for an organization)(or not more than twice the amount of gain 
or loss associated with the offense).95 Unlike attempt, conspirators may be 
punished for both conspiracy and for actually providing material support 
should be their scheme succeed.96 
Under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 2, anyone who counsels, procures, aids, 
or abets a violation of Section 2339A or any other federal crime is punishable 
as though he had committed the offense himself. “In order to aid and abet 
another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in some sort 
associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that 
he wishes to bring about, [and] that he seek by his action to make it 
succeed.”97 “Typically, the same evidence will support both a conspiracy and 
an aiding and abetting conviction.”98 Unlike conspiracy, however, liability 
under Section 2 only attaches if someone else commits the substantive 
offense.99 
 
 
Material Support 
 
Section 2339A uses roughly the same definition of “material support” as 
does Section 2339B, but to a somewhat different effect. Both use the definition 
found in 2339A(b) which covers “any property, tangible or intangible, or 
service.”100 The term excludes medicine and religious materials, but includes 
 
 
currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, 

Terrorist Material Support 
51
 
financial services, 
 
lodging, 
 
training (i.e., instruction or teaching designed to impart a specific 
skill, as opposed to general knowledge), 
 
expert advice or assistance (i.e., advice or assistance derived from 
scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge), 
 
safehouses, 
 
false documentation or identification, 
 
communications equipment, facilities, 
 
weapons, 
 
lethal substances, 
 
explosives, 
 
personnel (one or more individuals who may be or include oneself), 
and 
 
transportation.101 
 
Section 2339B alone has a more explicit description of “personnel” 
covered by its proscription, which confines the term to those provided to a 
foreign terrorist organization to direct its activities or to work under its 
direction or control.102 The omission of a comparable provision from Section 
2339A has led one court to include within the term those provided to work in a 
coordinated way for preparation or commission of a federal crime of 
terrorism.103 
Because Section 2339A requires that the support be given while knowing 
or intending that it be used in preparation for or in the commission of a 
specific terrorist offense, the section has survived the vagueness challenges 
that have troubled Section 2339B.104 
 
 
Concealing or Disguising Material Support 
 
Section 2339A condemns either providing material support or concealing 
“the nature, location, source, or ownership” of such support. The provision has 
been part of Section 2339A from the beginning105 and seems designed to reach 
the middle men or conduits between terrorists and their supporters. Expansion 
of the definition of material support to include services and the option of 
charging middle men with conspiracy or aiding and abetting may have 
rendered the provision redundant. In any event, concealment charges seem to 

Charles Doyle 
52
have thus far been confined to those who have also been charged with 
providing support.106 
 
 
Use in Relation to a Federal Crime of Terrorism 
 
Section 2339A only outlaws activities related to one or more of the federal 
crimes of terrorism listed in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B)(other than sections 
2339A or 2339B). The crimes, mostly violent offenses, are those likely to be 
committed in a terrorist context. A few of the more than 40 crimes on the list, 
like 18 U.S.C. 1203 (hostage taking), have a specific terrorist element (e.g., 
committed to influence or retaliate for government action). Most, like 18 
U.S.C. 81 (arson within a federal enclave), do not.107 
The defendant must know or intend that the support will assist in the 
commission of a federal crime of terrorism. Since the section bans attempts, 
conspiracies, and support used in preparation for a federal crime of terrorism 
(as well as support for carrying out such a crime), a violation of Section 2339A 
may occur even if the anticipated federal crime of terrorism has not.108 On the 
other hand, since the section also reaches support for concealment of an escape 
from a federal crime of terrorism, a violation of the section may occur even 
after the federal crime of terrorism. 
Several of the federal crimes of terrorism statutes cover conspiracy to 
violate their provisions; for example, 18 U.S.C. 956 (conspiracy to commit 
certain violent crimes overseas). Although the law ordinarily does not permit 
prosecution of a conspiracy to conspire, the “[c]ourts have recognized that one 
conspiracy can serve as the predicate for another conspiracy when the 
‘[overarching] conspiracy and the predicate conspiracy are distinct offenses 
with entirely different objectives.’”109 
 
 
Consequences of Charge or Conviction 
 
Conviction for a violation of Section 2339A is punishable by 
imprisonment for not more than 15 years (for any period of years or for life if 
death results from commission of the offense) and/or a fine of not more than 
$250,000 (not more than $500,000 for an organizational defendant). Although 
strictly speaking the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines are not binding, they weigh 
heavily in any sentencing decision.110 The Sentencing Guidelines contain a 
special terrorism enhancement that, if it applies, can have the effect of 

Terrorist Material Support 
53
requiring a sentence at the statutory maximum, because it calls for a minimum 
sentencing range that exceeds the statutory maximum of 15 years. The 
terrorism enhancement Guideline, Section 3A1.4, establishes a minimum 
offense level of 32 with a criminal history category of VI for a felony offense 
that “involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism.” The 
Guideline sentencing range of a crime with an offense level of 32 and a 
criminal history category of VI is imprisonment for from 210 to 262 months 
(17.5 to 21.8 years).111 Since the maximum term of imprisonment for 
violations of Section 2339A is 15 years and since a Sentencing Guideline 
sentence may not exceed the statutory maximum, the Guidelines call for a 
court to impose the statutory maximum.112 
The application of the terrorism Guideline requires either that the offense 
of conviction constitutes a federal crime of terrorism or that the offense of 
conviction was intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism.113 An offense 
qualifies as a federal crime of terrorism if it satisfies two conditions.114 The 
crime must be one listed as a federal crime of terrorism in 18 U.S.C. 
2332b(g)(5)(B). Section 2339A is listed. Second, the crime must be 
“calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or 
coercion, 
or 
to 
retaliate 
against 
government 
action,” 
18 
U.S.C. 
2332b(g)(5)(A). 
 
Federal Crime of Terrorism 
Classification as a federal crime of terrorism has several other 
consequences. Property derived from or used in the commission of such an 
offense is subject to confiscation, 18 U.S.C. 981(a)(1)(G). Federal crimes of 
terrorism are by definition predicate offenses for purposes of federal money 
laundering and RICO prosecutions.115 Prosecution of a Section 2339A offense 
is subject to an eight-year statute of limitations, rather than the general five-
year period.116 An accused charged with a violation of a federal crime of 
terrorism faces an enhanced prospect of pre-trial detention.117 A defendant 
convicted for violation of a federal crime of terrorism may be subject to a life-
time term of supervised release, rather than the general five-year maximum 
term.118

Extraterritorial Jurisdiction 
 
Unlike Section 2339B, Section 2339A has neither a general nor a 
descriptive statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction. Nevertheless, it seems 
likely that the courts would find its provisions applicable overseas for any of 
several reasons. First, extraterritorial jurisdiction is thought to apply to 
overseas accomplices to crimes with extraterritorial application.119 Second, to 
confine application to purely domestic violations would likely frustrate 
congressional intent and the purpose for its enactment.120 Third, violations 
would most likely be prosecuted under circumstances evidencing one or more 
of the principles that justify the exercise of federal jurisdiction under 
international law, for example, the offense has an impact in the U.S. (territorial 
principle); the offender is a U.S. national (nationality principle); the victim is a 
U.S. national (passive personality principle); the offense has an impact on U.S. 
national interests (protective principle); or the offense is universally 
condemned (universal principle).121 
 
 
Civil Actions 
 
Repeating again the principles mutually applicable to sections 2339B and 
2339A, we note that although neither Section 2339B nor Section 2339A 
creates a private civil cause of action, 18 U.S.C. 2333 authorizes such suits for 
those injured in their person, property, or business by an act of international 
terrorism.122 The courts have concluded that the violations of sections 2339A 
or 2339B may constitute “acts of international terrorism” for purposes of 
Section 2333.123 They do so by construing violations of Section 2339A or 
2339B as acts of “international terrorism” as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331(1).124 
 
 
Venue 
 
Section 2339A asserts that venue is proper in “any Federal judicial district 
in which the underlying offense was committed, or in any other Federal 
judicial district as provided by law,” 18 U.S.C. 2339A(a). The reach of this 
provision may be limited by Supreme Court decisions suggesting that venue 
over offenses committed within the United States is only proper in those 
districts in which the conduct element of the offense occurs.125

before 9/11, it has since become a principal tool in the Justice Department’s ‘terrorism’ 
prosecutions”). 
2 The text of 18 U.S.C. 2339A and 2339B is appended. 
3 P.L. 103-322, §120005, 108 Stat. 2022 (1994). The Violent Crime Control Act was a three 
hundred and fifty-five page amalgam of legislative proposals consisting of thirty-three 
separate titles which included Cop on the Beat grants, the Violence Against Women Act, 
revival of the death penalty as a federal sentencing alternative, a ban on assault weapons, 
DNA identification, and crime victims rights. Its various components had been the subject 
of two dozen House committee reports, listed in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1801 (1994), none 
which appear to have addressed Section 2339A. The section, however, had been included in 
much the same language in separate legislative proposals offered by members of both 
parties in both Houses, see e.g., H.R. 1301, §110 (Representative Schumer); H.R. 2847, 
§702 (Representative Sensenbrenner); H.R. 2872, §421 (Representative McCullom); H.R. 
1313 (Representative Brooks); S. 8, §702 (Senator Hatch); S. 1488, §726 (Senator Biden). 
4 P.L. 104-132, §§323, 303, 110 Stat. 1255, 1250, respectively. The Section 323 amendments to 
Section 2339A enlarged its predicate offense list to include 18 U.S.C. 37 (violence at 
international airports), 81 (arson), 175 (biological weapons), 831 (nuclear weapons), 842(m) 
and (n) (plastic explosives), 1362 (destruction of communications facilities), 2155 and 2156 
(destruction, or defective production, of war materials), 2332 (terrorist violence against 

Charles Doyle 
64
Americans overseas), 2332a (weapons of mass destruction), and 2332b(multi-national 
terrorism). Later in the year, Congress added three other crimes to Section 2339A’s 
predicate offense list: 18 U.S.C. 930(c) (use of a firearm during a murderous attack on a 
federal facility), 1992 (train wrecking), and 2332c (chemical weapons), P.L. 104-294, 
§601(b)(2), (s)(2), (s)(3), 110 Stat. 3502, 3506 (1996). 
5 H.Rept. 104-383, 81 (1995). AEDPA also eliminated a restriction on Section 2339A 
investigations which the report characterized as “effectively negat[ing] the efficacy of 
2339A,” id. at 82. 
6 P.L. 107-56, §§810(c), (d), 811(d), 115 Stat. 380, 381 (2001). At the time, attempts and 
conspiracies to violate Section 2339B were already subject to the same maximum penalty as 
the underlying substantive offense, 18 U.S.C. 2339B (2000 ed.). 
7 P.L. 108-458, §6603, 118 Stat. 3762 (2004). The amendments, initially temporary, were made 
permanent in the USA PATRIOT Act Improvement and Reauthorization Act, P.L. 109-177,

conspiracy and the actual provision of material support in the same section. See 18 U.S.C. 
§2339B(a)(1). (“Whoever knowingly provides material support ... or attempts or conspires 
to do so ...”). But, as the Supreme Court has held, the “settled principle” that “the 
commission of the substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit it are separate and 
distinct offenses” does not give way simply because the statute describing the substantive

technical, or other specialized knowledge. Similar to the Court’s discussion of ‘training’ 
above, ‘expert advice or assistance’ remains impermissibly vague because ‘specialized 
knowledge’ includes the same protected activities that ‘training’ covers, such as teaching 
international law for peacemaking resolutions or how to petition the United Nations to seek 
redress for human rights violations.... The Court finds that the undefined term ‘service’ in 
the IRTPA is impermissibly vague, as the statute defines ‘service’ to include ‘training’ or 
‘expert advice or assistance,’ terms the Court has already ruled are vague. Like ‘training’

donors to terrorist organizations within the grasp of section 2333. The ground involves a 
chain of explicit statutory incorporations by reference. The fist link in the chain is the 
statutory definition of ‘international terrorism’ as ‘activities that ... involve violent acts or 
acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States,’ 
that ‘appear to be intended ... to intimidate or coerce a civil population’ or ‘affect the 
conduct of a government by ... assassination, and that ‘transcend national boundaries in 
terms of the means by which they are accomplished’ or persons they appear intended to 
intimidate or coerce.’ 18 U.S.C. §2331(1). Section 2331...includes not only violent acts but 
also ‘acts dangerous to human life that are violation of the criminal laws of the United 
States. Giving money to Hamas, like giving a loaded gun to a child (which also is not a 
violent act), is an ‘act dangerous to human life.’ And it violates ... 18 U.S.C. §2339A(a), 
which provides that ‘whoever provides material support or resources ... knowing or 
intending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, of a violation of 
[e.g.,][18 U.S.C. 2332],’ shall be guilty of a federal crime. So we go to 18 U.S.C. §2332 and 
discover that it criminalizes the killing [of] ... any American citizen outside the United 
States. By this chain of incorporations by reference (section 2332(as) to section 2331(1) to 
Section 2339A to section 2332), we see that a donation to a terrorist group that targets 
Americans outside the United States may violate section 2333”); Goldberg v. UBS AG, 690

conspiracy and the actual provision of material support in the same section. See 18 U.S.C. 
§2339B(a)(1). (‘Whoever knowingly provides material support ... or attempts or conspires 
to do so ...’). But, as the Supreme Court has held, the ‘settled principle’ that ‘the 
commission of the substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit it are separate and 
distinct offenses’ does not give way simply because the statute describing the substantive 
offense also specifically prohibits conspiracies. Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587,

violation of §956”). 
107 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5) consists of two parts. One, section 2332b(g)(5)(A), includes within the 
definition of federal crimes of terrorism those offenses that are “calculated to influence or 
affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against 
government conduct.” The second, section 2332b(g)(5)(B) includes within the definition 
any offense proscribed by one of the statutes listed there. The definition of federal crimes of 
terrorism for purposes of Section 2339A by cross reference to 2332b(g)(5)(B) suggests that 
a violation of Section 2339A need not involve the terrorism-related circumstances of (5)(A) 
except when a prosecution involves a (5)(B) offense that has such a requirement.

original)(“[T]he Government need not prove all the elements of §956 [conspiracy to commit 
certain violent crimes overseas], the object offense, in order to satisfy the elements of the 
substantive § 2339A charge. By its elements, §2339A criminalizes material support given 
‘in preparation for’ the object offense – clearly, the object offense need not even have been 
completed yet, let alone proven as an element of the material support offense. To meet its 
burden under §2339A, the Government must at least prove that the defendants provided 
material support or resources knowing that they be used in preparation for the § 956 
conspiracy ”).

terrorism if a goal or purpose of the defendant’s act was to bring or help bring into being a 
crime listed in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B)”); United States v. Arnaout, 431 F.3d 994, 1000-

terrorism enhancement is applicable where a defendant is convicted of a federal crime of

not thought it necessary to make specific provision in the law that the locus shall include the

TESTIMONY OF REBECCA MACKINNON,  
CO-FOUNDER, GLOBAL VOICES ONLINE. 
HEARING ON “THE EVOLUTION  
OF TERRORIST PROPAGANDA: THE PARIS 
ATTACK AND SOCIAL MEDIA” 
 
 
The democratic world faces a serious challenge: how to fight terrorism 
and violent extremism in the Internet age while not undermining the core 
principles and freedoms of democratic and open societies. 
Yesterday I returned from the Philippines where I participated in a 
conference of bloggers, activists, and citizen journalists from all over the 
world. Many members of this community face serious threats not only to their 
freedom of speech but also to their physical freedom. While some have been 
kidnapped or threatened by terrorists or religious extremists, many more are 
imprisoned and threatened by governments who have labeled them terrorists – 
not because they actually are terrorists under definitions that people in this 
hearing room would use, but because they have expressed views or reported 
facts that their governments find threatening.1 
For example, in Ethiopia a group of bloggers and investigative journalists 
known as the “zone nine bloggers” are currently on trial for terrorism under a 
law that has frequently been used to silence journalists.2 Last year the Russian 
parliament amended its anti-terror laws to include a set of draconian Internet

before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on Terrorism, 
Nonproliferation, and Trade.

controls that justify the jailing of opposition bloggers and activists, and require 
companies to keep data of Russian users in Russia so that they can be better 
surveilled.3 In Turkey, the government has prosecuted journalists for “praising 
of violence and terrorist propaganda.” However an investigation by the 
Committee to Protect Journalists found that “Turkish authorities conflated the 
coverage of banned groups and the investigation of sensitive topics with 
outright terrorism or other anti-state activity.”4 Last year Amnesty 
International reported that the Moroccan government uses anti-terror laws to 
target journalists.5 Egypt has recently made similar use of anti-terror laws.6 
In response to the tragic Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, last week the 
French government called for UN member states to work together on an 
international legal framework that would place greater responsibility on social 
networks and other Internet platforms for terrorist use of their services.7 
In addressing the problem of terrorist use of social networking platforms, 
the United States and all other stakeholders committed to upholding 
international human rights norms, as well as a free and open global Internet, 
should adhere to the following principles: 
 
1. Multi-stakeholder policymaking. 
 
Note that the countries mentioned above that abuse anti-terror laws to jail 
activists and journalists are all UN member states - along with a long list of 
other nations including China, Venezuela, and others whose definitions of 
terrorism are elastic enough to be used to keep incumbent regimes in power. 
The US has opposed UN control over Internet governance because a large 
number of UN member states seek a governance framework that would result 
in a global Internet that is much less free and open than it is today – for 
commerce and innovation as well as for political discourse. Instead the US 
supports a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance that includes 
industry, civil society, and the technical community alongside governments in 
processes that set policies and standards for the global Internet. Any 
international effort to address terrorism on the Internet should also be 
grounded in a robust multi-stakeholder approach to ensure that any solutions 
are compatible with innovation, the free flow of information, and universal 
human rights. 
 
 
 
 

Testimony of Rebecca MacKinnon …

2. Human rights assessment of laws, regulations, and policies. 
 
Any national level laws, regulations, or policies aimed at fighting online 
terrorism (or any potential regulation affecting online speech or privacy for 
that matter) should undergo assessment, carried out in consultation with 
human rights experts and representatives of groups whose rights are 
potentially at risk of being violated, to identify any ways in which the new 
measures could have negative consequences for journalism, activism, and the 
free flow of information more broadly. Policies and laws should not be 
enacted without robust checks and balances, or if proponents cannot 
demonstrate how human rights risks will be mitigated. 
Laws and regulations governing company actions should be vetted to 
ensure that they do not compel companies to violate core principles of freedom 
of expression and privacy, grounded in international human rights standards. 
Several major US-based Internet companies have made commitments under 
the multi-stakeholder Global Network Initiative to respect users’ freedom of 
expression and privacy in a number of specific ways. These commitments 
include: narrowly interpreting government demands to restrict content or grant 
access to user data or communications; challenging government requests that 
lack a clear user basis; transparency with users about the types of government 
requests received and the extent to which the company complies; restricting 
compliance to the online domains over which the requesting government 
actually has jurisdiction.8 
 
3. Limited intermediary liability. 
 
A large body of research conducted around the world by human rights 
experts and legal scholars shows clear evidence that when companies are held 
liable for users’ speech and activity, violations of free expression and privacy 
can be expected to occur for a number of reasons. Companies operating under 
strict or strong liability regimes generally over-censor in order to avoid legal 
and regulatory repercussions to their business. Strong liability regimes have 
also been shown to increase the likelihood that companies will comply with 
spurious demands for content removal made by governments as well as private 
parties in order to play it safe: there is no penalty for over-censoring while the 
legal consequences of under-censoring can be severe.9 Limited liability for 
Internet intermediaries is an important prerequisite for keeping the Internet 
open and free. 
 

Rebecca MacKinnon

4. Transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement in the 
development and enforcement of companies’ Terms of Service and 
other forms of self-regulation. 
 
In response to outreach from counter-terrorism authorities among others, 
some social networking companies are using their terms of service, 
community guidelines, and other self-regulatory mechanisms to shut down 
accounts and delete content that is technically protected by the first 
amendment, or whose removal has not been sought by any government or 
court through any formal legal process or mechanism. While this may have 
helped to prevent acts of violent extremism by terrorist groups, there are also 
many documented cases in which such self-regulation has resulted in 
censorship of activists, journalists, and political opposition groups. For 
example last year the SecDev Foundation, a Canadian non-profit that works 
with digital activists around the world, compiled a list of moderate Syrian 
opposition groups and citizen journalists whose Facebook pages had been shut 
down.10 
More broadly, Facebook has come under fire from activists for enforcing 
its community guidelines in a way that sometimes silences voices and 
information that have few other outlets. For example, at the end of last year 
three Tibetans burned themselves alive to protest Chinese rule. Self-
immolation is a gruesome but long-standing form of political protest in 
Buddhist societies. The Chinese government censors news of Tibetan protests 
generally and self immolations in particular. Facebook has deleted postings by 
Tibetan activists about the recent self-immolations, citing policies forbidding 
excessively graphic content. Facebook insists that enforcement of its own 
policies has nothing to do with the Chinese government.11 While I am inclined 
to believe them in this case, the point is that de facto political censorship can 
happen – whether companies intend it or not – when companies lack sufficient 
mechanisms to ensure transparency about their policies and enforcement 
practices, and when their policies are developed and implemented without 
impact assessment or engagement with human rights groups about potential 
unintended consequences. 
Any new self-regulatory mechanisms or procedures developed by 
companies to combat terror must be accompanied by an increase rather than 
decrease in the levels of transparency with users and engagement with key 
affected stakeholders and at-risk groups.

5. Clear and effective grievance and redress mechanisms. 
 
In order to prevent abuse of anti-terror laws or informal measures taken by 
governments or companies, it is vital that there be robust mechanisms and 
processes for accountability. In particular, governments as well as companies 
should provide effective, accessible channels for grievance and remedy for 
people whose rights to free expression, assembly, and privacy have been 
violated by measures taken to combat online extremism. Public and private 
entities that abuse these measures in a way that violates human rights must be 
held accountable.12 
We live in a time of extraordinary threats to our national security. But the 
fight against terrorism online must be carried out in a way that also protects 
and respects human rights. If the US and other democracies cannot figure out 
how to do this, victories against violent extremism online are likely to be 
hollow and short lived.

PARTNERS. HEARING ON “THE EVOLUTION 
OF TERRORIST PROPAGANDA: THE PARIS 
ATTACK AND SOCIAL MEDIA” 
 
 
Charlie Hebdo and the Jihadi Online Network: Assessing the Role of 
American Commercial Social Media Platforms. 
 
As more young people from the United States and other Western 
countries—who have no prior links to Syria or the jihadi organizations 
fighting there—seek to depart to join the frontline in the Levant, there has 
been an increasing public awareness of the role that jihadi online social media 
and networks are serving in recruiting them to the cause and providing them 
with the basic guidance necessary to reach their destination. This has come 
both in the form of indirect recruitment (i.e., glossy English-language 
propaganda videos and magazines distributed on the Internet), as well as direct 
recruitment by Western jihadists in Syria and Iraq who have regular access to 
major commercial social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, 
Skype, Tumblr, and Kik. Several weeks ago, Zarine Khan—the mother of a 
19-year-old Illinois man facing federal charges for attempting to travel to 
Syria—emotionally addressed a news conference and denounced “the

before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on Terrorism, 
Nonproliferation, and Trade.

brainwashing and recruiting of children through the use of social media and 
the Internet... We have a message for ISIS, Mr. Baghdadi and his fellow 
social-media recruiters: Leave our children alone!”1 
The influx of Americans and other social-media-savvy Westerners seems 
to have bred a noticeable divergence from traditional proprietary Arabic-
language jihadi chat forums to the slicker interfaces and enormous global 
audience afforded by services like Facebook and Twitter. The odd sense of 
comfort that Western jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq feel in using such 
platforms is somewhat disturbing. After engaging in live discussion for several 
hours last October via the Kik Messenger service with Farah Shirdon, a 
Somali-Canadian ISIS fighter in Mosul, he told me, “for the next week I’ll be 
busy going to Syria to handle some[thing] so we need to finish this up 
tomorrow.” Young millenials like Mr. Shirdon are so confident in the 
reliability and security of these big name social media companies that they 
have not even a second thought about disclosing such potentially sensitive 
information—even to known adversaries. 
The trend towards jihadists exploiting (and indeed relying upon) Western 
commercial social media platforms for their online communications has been 
in full view in the aftermath of this month’s terrorist attacks in Paris. Though 
relatively little is known about how the Kouachi brothers and Amedy 
Coulibaly were using social media prior to the attacks, claims of responsibility 
for the tragic events in Paris emerged quite quickly from Al-Qaida in the 
Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)—all of which were distributed exclusively via 
Twitter. On January 9, an account purportedly run by a fighter in the ranks of 
AQAP, “Bakhsarouf Al-Yemen,” tweeted that AQAP was behind the attack 
and promised his followers that an official claim of credit would soon be 
released, but that it had been delayed due to “security reasons.”2 The Twitter 
user directly addressed “the relationship between Al-Qaida and the Charlie 
Hebdo battle: the relationship is direct and the operation was supervised by Al-
Qaida’s branch in the Arabian Peninsula. The operation was directed by the 
leadership of AQAP, and they chose these targets carefully, to avenge the 
honor of our prophet... and in France specifically, for its role that is not hidden 
in the war on Islam.”3 
Later on the same day, AQAP’s official Al-Malahem media wing used its 
account on Twitter to disseminate download links for an audio message of 
AQAP official Hareth al-Nadhari praising the Paris attacks and condemning 
France: “men from among the faithful soldiers of Allah embarked and taught 
them how to be polite and the limits on freedom of expression; soldiers came 
to you who love Allah and his messenger, who do not care about death, and 

Testimony of Evan Kohlmann … 
83
who are fond of martyrdom for the cause of Allah... O’ heroic mujahideen... 
may your hands be preserved... I wish I was there with you.”4 On January 14, 
again using the same Twitter account, AQAP distributed download links for a 
direct claim of responsibility for the Paris attacks in the form of a video from 
senior AQAP leader Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi.5 In the video, al-Ansi declared that 
AQAP engineered the attacks “as a vengeance for the Messenger of Allah. We 
clarify to the ummah that the one who chose the target, laid the plan and 
financed the operation, is the leadership of the organization.” Al-Ansi further 
mocked the unity rallies that took place in Paris in the wake of the attacks: 
“Look at how they gathered, rallied and supported each other; strengthening 
their weakness and dressing their wounds. Those wounds have not healed and 
they won’t, be it in Paris, New York or Washington, or in London or Spain.”6 
In fact, as of the time of this testimony, AQAP—a designated foreign 
terrorist organization according to U.S. law—has not one, but two official 
accounts on Twitter— one for releasing videos and recordings and the other 
for releasing statements and breaking news updates. Nor is AQAP alone—
other allied factions such as Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) have 
also begun to eschew the traditional established route of publishing jihadi 
media through password-protected proprietary jihadi chat forums and instead 
they have been releasing material directly via Twitter. This process has taken 
place quite seamlessly despite reported initiatives by Twitter to curb the use of 
its network for terrorist propaganda in the wake of the recorded beheadings of 
James Foley and other Western journalists captured in Syria. Over the past 
three months, AQAP’s public Twitter account has only been disabled by 
system administrators on four occasions. Each time it has been disabled, 
AQAP has merely created a new account with the same name, appended with 
“1”, “2”, “3”, and “4” respectively. Thus, there is hardly any mystery in what 
Twitter account AQAP will register next. 
The failure of Twitter to learn from and adapt to this rudimentary pattern 
would suggest fundamental failures in its responsibility to prevent its service 
from becoming a mouthpiece for terrorist organizations. One jihadist has 
smugly advised Twitter to simply sit back and “let us continue spread our 
daawah (JIHAD)” because the company’s current efforts aimed at thwarting 
such uses are pointless: “it takes 2 minutes to get new acc[ounts].”7 It should 
be emphasized that AQAP’s videos and statements about the Paris attacks 
have only been released on Twitter, and—weeks later—still have yet to appear 
in the areas of elite Arabic-language jihadi chat forums that are reserved for 
the group. This means that Twitter is not only their preferred means of 
propaganda distribution, it is verging on being their sole one as well. While 

Evan Kohlmann 
84
Twitter’s CEO Dick Costolo has insisted that Twitter is “actively suspending 
accounts as we discover them”, the company also acknowledges that some 
offending accounts are nonetheless left online by system administrators due to 
“public interest factors such as the newsworthiness of the content.”8 
Nonetheless, Twitter is not the only offender here. The primarily text-
based communication service may be ideal for rapidly distributing download 
links, but not broadcasting the video files themselves. The actual AQAP audio 
and video content addressing the Paris attacks are hosted on services that 
include Google’s YouTube streaming service; Shenandoah, Texas-based cloud 
storage company Mediafire.com; and the San Francisco-based 501(c)(3) non-
profit 
Internet 
Archive 
(www.archive.org). 
While 
YouTube 
and 
Mediafire.com have become somewhat more adept at disabling terrorist 
propaganda hosted on their networks, the Internet Archive has become the de-
facto preferred storage point for jihadi audio and videos, whether from AQAP 
or ISIS. Archive.org was founded in 1996 with the noble intent of building an 
Internet library and providing “permanent access” to “historical collections 
that exist in digital format.”9 Unfortunately, in the present era, the term 
“historical collections” is now broad enough to encompass jihadist propaganda 
in the form of graphic beheading and execution videos, suicide bombings, and 
claims of responsibility for the attacks in Paris—which have been permanently 
preserved on Archive.org in their original, high-resolution formats. The fact 
that this powerful propaganda remains easily accessible raises the question of 
when the principles of open reporting and freedom of speech can or should be 
extended to include incitement to racial and ethnic hate, and calls for violence 
from terrorist organizations. 
This leads to another aspect of jihadi social media that surfaced as a result 
of the Paris attacks: the apparently conflicting video released on January 10 
that featured Amedy Coulibaly claiming responsibility for the attacks in the 
name of ISIS. In the video, Coulibaly condemned recent Western airstrikes on 
ISIS and insisted, “You act like the victims as if you don’t understand what’s 
been happening for months... If you attack the Caliphate, if you attack the 
Islamic State, we will attack you. You can’t attack and not expect a 
response.”10 He also explained the nature of his relationship with the Kouachi 
brothers: “Brothers in our team divided themselves in two... We worked partly 
together, but also partly separate, it's more like a pact.” Links to the Coulibaly 
video were first posted in a general discussion room of the main ISIS online 
chat forum Alplatformmedia.com by an ordinary registered user “Amir 
Monsaf”—and not by an authorized courier from ISIS’ official media wing.11 
After the content of the video became clear, the message containing the 

Testimony of Evan Kohlmann … 
85
download links was moved by forum administrators to the official ISIS media 
room. This sequence of events, and the lack of any watermark on the video 
from an official ISIS media unit, strongly suggests that it was produced and 
distributed by unknown parties independent of ISIS. As with the AQAP 
videos, the video of Mr. Coulibaly itself was hosted on YouTube, the Internet 
Archive, and several other U.S.-based cloud hosting services. 
The natural question that follows from this analysis is how does ISIS 
manage to reliably operate its own official proprietary dot-com social media 
platform on the Internet in order to disseminate videos such as the beheading 
of James Foley and the “martyrdom” will of Amedy Coulibaly? The answer is 
another San Francisco-based American tech security company called 
CloudFlare, which aims to shield Internet websites and resources from being 
targeted by spammers, cybercriminals, and frustrating denial-of-service 
attacks. CloudFlare, which boasts that 4% of all web requests flows through its 
network, in essence serves as gatekeeper to control the flow of visitors to 
given sites and to verify that those visitors have a legitimate purpose in 
visiting them.12 It has advanced detection features that complicate (or thwart 
entirely) attempts by automated robots to scrape data from and monitor these 
forums, including browser tests and so-called “captcha codes.” In fact, two of 
ISIS’ 
top 
three 
online 
chat 
forums— 
including 
the 
notorious 
Alplatformmedia.com—are currently guarded by CloudFlare. Without such 
protection from CloudFlare, these sites would almost certainly succumb to the 
same relentless online attacks that have completely collapsed several major 
jihadi web forums over the past two years. 
In 2013, after CloudFlare was contacted by journalists over allegations 
that their service was providing protection to terrorist websites, the company’s 
CEO Matthew Prince published a full explanation of their policy in this 
regard. According to Prince, it would not “be right for us to monitor the 
content that flows through our network and make determinations on what is 
and what is not politically appropriate. Frankly, that would be creepy... 
Removing this, or any other site, from our network wouldn't remove the 
content from the Internet: it would simply slow its performance and make it 
more vulnerable to attack.”13 In his response, Prince also asserted: 
 
“A website is speech. It is not a bomb. There is no imminent danger 
it creates and no provider has an affirmative obligation to monitor and 
make determinations about the theoretically harmful nature of speech a 
site may contain... There are lots of things on the web I find personally 
distasteful. I have political beliefs, but I don't believe those beliefs should 

Evan Kohlmann 
86
color what is and is not allowed to flow over the network. As we have 
blogged about before, we often find ourselves on opposite sides of 
political conflicts. Fundamentally, we are consistent in the fact that our 
political beliefs will not color who we allow to be fast and safe on the 
web.”14 
 
In June 2010, in the context of the case of Holder v. Humanitarian Law 
Project, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a strict view of the “expert advice and 
assistance” clause of U.S. counterterrorism laws, making even nonviolent 
advocacy potentially an illicit form of material support if it is carried out in 
conjunction with a proscribed terrorist organization.15 The case had 
specifically centered on a group of American civil rights activists who 
advertised their mission as helping such groups “find peaceful ways to achieve 
[their] goals.” It is extremely difficult to reconcile the logical paradox that it is 
currently illegal to give pro-bono assistance to a terrorist group in order for 
them to adopt politics instead of violence, but it is perfectly legal for 
CloudFlare to commercially profit from a terrorist group by assisting them to 
communicate securely with recruits and to publicly disseminate recordings of 
mass murder. Indeed, CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince has been adamant in 
his declarations that “CloudFlare abides by all applicable laws in the countries 
in which we operate and we firmly support the due process of law.”16 Prince 
continues to insist, “We have never received a request to terminate the site in 
question from any law enforcement authority, let alone a valid order from a 
court.”17 
In deference to CloudFlare, it is possible that the company has received a 
formal request from law enforcement to continue providing its services to such 
an illicit online forum. Yet, even as one who has repeatedly advocated leaving 
jihadi forums online in order to study those who use them, this possibility 
gives me pause for reflection. If so, there must be a careful assessment of the 
potential negative policy impacts of leaving ISIS recruitment platforms online 
and unmolested in light of the recognition that Western security services are 
abjectly failing to track, identify, and stop all of those who are using these 
sites. 
The multi-billion dollar U.S. companies who provide social media 
services to ISIS and Al-Qaida are well aware that the way American law is 
presently structured, it is almost impossible for them to ever be held legally 
liable or responsible for the potential mayhem that their paying users might 
cause. The only real incentive they have to address this problem is when it 
becomes so glaring and embarrassing, as it was in the case of slain American 

Testimony of Evan Kohlmann … 
87
journalist James Foley, that they are temporarily forced to take action to save 
public face. Without concerted pressure both from the American people as 
well as the Congress—in addition to meaningful legal reform aimed at closing 
loopholes that allow service providers to turn a blind eye to the identities of 
their users—this problem is almost certain to grow steadily worse in the 
months and years to come. Permitting U.S. commercial interests to simply 
ignore vital national security concerns and earn profits from consciously 
providing high-tech services to banned terrorist organizations is not an 
acceptable legal framework in the 21st century.
