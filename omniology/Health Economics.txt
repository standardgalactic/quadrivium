 Preface 
 Health economics is a growing research field. The number of textbooks in this field 
has increased as well. Although there are many choices, it is difficult to find a 
textbook that exactly fits the needs of a particular class of students — who them-
selves are highly diverse. Health economics is a field within the more general field 
of applied microeconomics. But unlike other microeconomic applications, such as 
public economics, labor economics, and industrial organization, health economics 
is widely taught outside economics departments, such as in schools of public 
health (e.g., in hospital administration programs), public policy, business, nursing, 
pharmacy, and medicine. Moreover, the number of university-based programs in 
global health has exploded in recent years. 
 In these programs taught outside economics departments, the demand for 
health economics stems much more from an inherent interest in health care than 
from a primary interest in economics. Yet an understanding of economics as 
applied to health care can be very important to the development of such students ’ 
careers and for understanding the workings of health care markets more generally. 
One of our students recently told us that before taking a course in health economics 
she had believed, as she was told, that pharmaceutical companies were  “ bad ”  for 
not developing drugs needed by people in low-income countries. After taking the 
course, she better understood the constraints under which such companies operate, 
the incentives they face, and proposed public policy solutions for encouraging 
research and development of drugs for diseases that are highly prevalent in low-
income countries — material addressed in this book. 
 Students have access to lengthy descriptions of health systems from other 
sources. What is needed — and what we set ourselves to provide — is a book combin-
ing economic concepts with empirical evidence to enhance the reader ’ s under-
standing of how health care institutions and markets function. 
 This book ’ s goal is to present theoretical and empirical findings as they 
pertain to decisions individuals make about their health and health care and 
choices the suppliers of health care services make. It is also intended to serve as 
a guide for government decision making about resource allocation and policy in 
the health sector. The theoretical and empirical approaches discussed in this book 
draw heavily on the more general field of applied microeconomics. At the same 
time, no analysis of health economics is complete without a description and analy-
sis of important institutional features of health sectors in countries around the 
world. These institutional features encompass both financing and the provision of 
personal health care services. 
 This book makes at least three innovative contributions. First, reflecting the 
increased interest in global health, we take a global view in the sense that our 

xxviii 
 Preface
analysis is not country-specific (i.e., largely focused on the United States) but 
applies to countries all over the world. Where other books might offer a chapter 
on international health systems, this book presents far more on global health, yet 
simultaneously has a substantial amount of empirical evidence on health care 
services and markets in the United States. Having authors from two distinct parts 
of the world has helped with the global perspective, for the issues addressed in 
this book often apply to every country. For example, individuals in every country 
make similar important decisions about their careers, including whether or not to 
become a physician, how to select a physician specialty, and the choice of practice 
location and type of practice. Similarly, pharmaceutical manufacturers in many 
countries face the same decisions about whether or not to invest in new products 
and how to set the price and promote these new products. 
 Second, while health economics has been, in our view appropriately, regarded 
as a topic in applied microeconomics, this book also takes a macroeconomic per-
spective. One chapter describes how the health sector operates from the perspective 
of the macroeconomy. Thus, the book is organized sequentially in a way that has 
been widely used in economics, beginning with the individual and firm level, then 
shifting to the market level, and finally moving to a macroeconomic level that views 
the economy as a whole and considers the role of health and health care within 
the macroeconomy. 
 Quality of care has traditionally been viewed as the exclusive domain of 
medical experts. In the last decade or so, experts from other disciplines have 
become actively involved in research on health care quality. Economists have 
joined in such analysis, too. After all, enterprises in all sectors make decisions 
about levels of quality to offer, just as we all do as consumers. Further, consumer 
ignorance about quality is a source of market power. We economists are interested 
in ways to make markets, including health care markets, more transparent. Chapter 
7 deals specifically with health care quality. 
 This book includes three chapters on health systems (chapters 11 – 13), provid-
ing an analysis brand new to this field. In addition, chapter 16 provides an over-
view of the link between health and economic sectors, also a new contribution. 
This chapter should interest public policy makers and health industry leaders, as 
well as college and university students. 
 Third, this book takes a comprehensive view in the sense that it includes 
detailed discussions of health and health behaviors as well as health care, nurses 
as well as physicians, nonlabor inputs in the production of health (i.e., pharma-
ceuticals) as well as labor-intensive hospitals and physicians ’ services,  and macro- 
as well as microanalysis. 
 The book ’ s comprehensiveness can be seen in three other dimensions: space, 
time, and methods. On the space dimension, this book takes a global perspective. 
We discuss the role of the consumer in the health sector not only by focusing on 
demand for personal health care services (chapter 3) but also by focusing on the 

Preface 
 xxix
demand for health behavior (chapter 2) and health insurance (chapter 4). Similarly, 
our discussion of the supply side of the health care market draws in all major 
players, including physicians (chapters 5 and 7), hospitals (chapters 6 and 7, which 
mainly focus on quality of care), nurses (chapter 8), pharmaceutical manufacturers 
(chapter 9), and private insurers (chapter 10). The discussion of health care systems 
extends to all possible systems in the world (chapters 11 – 13). 
 In addition to the positive economics, which aims to explain why behaviors 
are observed (what is), we also include two chapters (chapters 14 and 15) on nor-
mative economics, methodologies used for making recommendations about poli-
cies that should be adopted (what ought to be). We then extend our analysis to the 
macroeconomics of the health sector (chapter 16) and the future development of 
the field of health economics (chapter 17). 
 With regard to the time dimension, we include discussions of some classics 
in health economics, but we also introduce some of the newest material in the 
field. Examples of classics are  Arrow (1963) ,  Newhouse (1970) ,  Grossman (1972) , 
 Pauly and Redisch (1973) ,  Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) , and  Manning, Newhouse, 
Duan, et al. (1987) . Although these works were published well before student 
readers ’  births and even most professors ’ births, they raised important issues in the 
health economics field that have greatly influenced other work and remain highly 
relevant today. Also, Sloan ’ s long-standing interest in the supply of health care is 
reflected in the chapters on the supply, organization, and financing of personal 
health care services. 
 With regard to analytic methods, we have made a substantial effort to close 
the gaps among conceptual analysis, empirical evidence, and the institutional 
features of the health sector. You as readers will be the judges how successful we 
have been in this respect. 
 Much of the conceptual analysis reviews and extends material economics 
majors will have learned in other economics courses. Empirical research is often 
regarded by students as a bitter pill.  “ Why do I have to learn the details of studies? ” 
The answer is that you will not need to know the details of specific studies later 
in life. However, having analytic skills, being able to critically evaluate empirical 
material, summarize it in capsule form, and draw policy recommendations (private 
and public) from it, is very important for later life. 
 Students and professors in economics department often perceive the complex 
institutional features of the health sector as barriers to entry into this field. By 
contrast, the theoretical reasoning of economics often is a barrier to students who 
do not major in economics. This book attempts to reduce these important barriers 
to entry. It explains some of the complex institutions and provides references for 
readers who want to learn more. The book presents a theoretical background for 
non-economics majors that is also designed to serve as a review for majors. One 
role of applied economics courses is to reinforce concepts introduced in theory 
courses.

 Preface
 Given the broad potential readership, the book is designed for use by students 
in undergraduate economic programs, as well by students in various undergraduate 
and graduate professional programs who have taken few or no prior courses in 
economics. The book contains many graphs and tables; the use of calculus is 
minimized. 
 Overall, this book is designed for a one-semester course in health economics 
with no economics prerequisites. However, if it is supplemented by readings from 
other sources, it will be more appropriate for a year-long course. One way to divide 
the course is on the basis of the traditional paradigm of demand and supply. The 
book is a bit imbalanced in favor of supply, but there are many more journal articles 
on demand, especially on demand globally. 
 For students with an economics background, this book should enhance an 
understanding of how economic analysis can be applied to various settings in the 
real world. In the United States, which is a large and extreme case, the health sector 
now occupies one-sixth of gross domestic product. Other high-income countries 
are also experiencing substantial relative growth in their health sectors, though at 
a lower percentage of GDP. Middle-income and some low-income countries have 
this to look forward to. Professors can use this book to teach applications of eco-
nomic concepts rather than dwell on minute details of the US health care system 
or the systems in other countries. 
 For students in other fields of concentration, this book can be used in various 
settings to introduce economics concepts as they apply to health and health care 
and to read up-to-date summaries of research findings and issues in health econom-
ics without spending substantial effort on learning the basic tools of economic 
analysis or having to skip learning some highly relevant concepts altogether. 
 Reflecting that health economics began in the United States more than half a 
century ago, much of the material in this book is based on US studies. However, 
in recent years an increasing share of health economics studies has come from 
other countries. As communications technology has improved, global awareness 
of issues particular to middle- and low-income countries has increased, as has 
research on health care issues specific to these countries. Although constrained by 
what remains a relative lack of studies using data from these countries, this book 
incorporates much of the health economics research from low- and middle-income 
countries that currently exists. We hope that publication of this book with its 
explanations and methodological approaches will help promote health economics 
research in many understudied countries.

 Introduction and Overview 
 Health economics is a growing field within the discipline of economics. Health 
economics deals with issues related to the financing and delivery of health services 
and the role of such services and other personal decisions in contributing to per-
sonal health.  
 Unlike the opening of department stores and car dealerships, there is no grand 
opening for a new field in a discipline such as economics. As an academic field 
of inquiry, there was virtually no health economics research before 1945, and rela-
tively little after that date until the 1960s ( Phelps 1995 ;  Fuchs 1996 ). During 
the early 1960s, two Nobel laureates published papers that had an important 
impact on the development of health economics as a field. One was the seminal 
paper by Kenneth Arrow emphasizing the role of uncertainty in determining 
key institutional features of the health sector ( Arrow 1963 ). The other was Gary 
Becker ’ s treatise on human capital, which provided the theoretical foundation for 
economists to analyze the role of health care in the production of health ( Becker 
1964 ). Since the early 1960s, health economics has enjoyed several decades of 
remarkable growth, and the future of this field looks extremely bright as well 
( Fuchs 2000 ). 
 This chapter introduces some key economic concepts and describes the 
content of the book.

 Introduction and Overview
 1.1 
 Health Economics as a Field of Inquiry 
 The Importance of Health Economics 
 Everyone is affected by health and personal health care services in important ways. 
Your health affects your enjoyment of life, your ability to contribute to your fam-
ily ’ s well-being and to be a productive member of the workforce, and, earlier in 
life, your ability to be productive in school. Most people receive at least one per-
sonal health care service annually. By midlife, and certainly later in life, the con-
sumption of personal health services tends to be much higher than for younger 
adults. When employed, you probably will pay taxes that finance health insurance 
and personal health care services. Given the importance of the health sector in 
many countries, many of you will eventually find employment in an organization 
involved in health care provision or financing, or be involved with health care as 
an attorney, a business leader, or a government official. 
 The impact of health economics is felt not only within the discipline of eco-
nomics but also outside the field. Health economists are as likely to be cited in 
scholarly journals and other publications outside the economics literature, such as 
in medical, public health, and public policy books and journals, as they are in 
economics publications.  Fuchs (2000) attributed this phenomenon to the  “ two-hat ” 
nature of health economics. On the one hand, health economics is a behavioral 
science: high-quality research in this field advances the discipline of economics 
in general and, more broadly, all the social science disciplines. On the other hand, 
health economics provides valuable insights into and empirical evidence on impor-
tant health policy issues and health services research, a general field in which 
experts in clinical practice and public health are engaged. 
 Judged by their participation in the public policy arena and the media, health 
economists have had an important presence. Of course, our advice has been disre-
garded more often than it has been followed. Practical political considerations often 
weigh much more heavily in actual public policy decisions than they do in econo-
mists ’ policy recommendations. Also, new public policy directions are much more 
likely to be undertaken when there is a crisis. At other times, inertia prevents the 
adoption of even sound new ideas. 
 Health economists investigate positive issues — empirical relationships among 
variables as they are — more frequently than they do normative issues, or policy 
recommendations about how resources  should be allocated and distributed. 
Examples of research on positive issues are inquiries into the response of demand 
to changes in the price of personal health care services, individuals ’ choices 
among several health insurance plans, the decision to start or stop smoking, the 
decisions pharmaceutical manufacturers make about investments in research and 
development, determinants of physicians ’ fees, and hospitals ’ price and output 
decisions. 

Introduction and Overview 
 3
 People, firms, and health care organizations are motivated by incentives. Not 
all incentives that affect decisions are financial, but many are. To achieve socially 
desirable outcomes, incentives must be structured appropriately. In most markets 
in most economies, prices provide inducements for those levels of outputs of goods 
and services to be supplied that are most desired, given the resources available to 
the party making the decision. Governments are largely on the sidelines, policing 
abuses and imposing taxes to raise revenue, but in general, governments do not 
play an active role in resource allocation in most markets. As explained below, 
however, government intervention is more common in health care than in most 
sectors. 
 The Growth of Health Economics 
 There is no common metric to measure the growth of a research field. Two alterna-
tive measures are among those that can be used to gauge the tremendous expansion 
of the field of health economics in the past several decades. First, the number of 
PhDs awarded annually in health economics has increased rapidly over time. For 
example, in the United States, the number of dissertations on health economics 
increased elevenfold from 1965 to 1994. By contrast, the number of dissertations 
in all fields of economics increased only 2.5 times during the same period ( Fuchs 
1996 ). A similar pattern is evident from lists of doctoral dissertations in economics 
published in the  Journal of Economic Literature,  which reveals a high rate of 
growth of health economics in terms of the number of dissertations completed 
during 1991 – 2008 (  fig. 1.1 ).  
 Second, by a number of metrics, the supply of health economists and of 
health economics, measured in terms of books and papers published, public testi-
mony, editorials, and other media reports, has increased. Growth in the supply of 
PhDs in health economics has enabled many professional schools, government 
agencies, and research institutes to add health economists to their staffs, which 
in turn has increased the capacity for health economics research and policy devel-
opment. The share of National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working 
papers devoted to health economics has grown from 1.2 percent in 1986 to 12 
percent in 2008 (  fig. 1.1 ). The number of professional journals devoted to health 
economics has also increased. The first professional journal in the field, the  Journal 
of Health Economics , began in 1982. By 2006 there were seven journals specializing 
in health economics (  table 1.1 ). Particularly in view of the growth of both real 
expenditures on personal health care services worldwide and the growing number 
and size of public health programs, it seems reasonable to expect these trends to 
continue.

 1.2 
 Factors Accounting for the Growth of Health 
Economics 
 Two external factors account for the dramatic growth of health economics as a field: 
(1) global health and longevity gains and (2) the expansion of health sectors 
throughout the world. 
 Improvements in Health and Longevity 
 Because of their effect on individuals ’ productivity and enjoyment of life, improve-
ments in health and longevity are closely related to overall improvements in well-
being. One study argues that between 1950 and 2000, improvements in health in 
the United States were as valuable as all other sources of economic growth com-
bined ( Nordhaus 2005 ). Medical care was unquestionably far more productive in 
the year 2000 than it was a century earlier. However, medical care delivery and 
technological advances in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are not the only 
source of health improvements over the past century. Health behaviors and envi-
ronmental factors, including improvements in sanitation and shifts in the occupa-
tional structure and those attributable to urbanization, have certainly played a role. 
 Health and longevity have improved dramatically in most countries around 
the world, especially in the middle-income and the most affluent countries.  Oeppen 
and Vaupel (2002 ) documented secular trends in longevity in countries with the 
highest longevity. In these countries, female life expectancy at birth increased by 
40 years in the 160 years preceding the start of the twenty-first century. This 
increase amounts to a rise in longevity of three months  per year  over an extended 
time period, 1840 – 2000. More recently, gains in life expectancy have also been 
observed in less affluent countries. For example, the longevity gain between 1960 
and 2005 in the United States was 7.9 years. By contrast, the gain in life expectancy 
at birth in China was 35.5 years during the same period (  fig. 1.2 ).  
 More specifically, 149 out of 156 countries worldwide experienced substan-
tial longevity gains during 1960 – 2005 (  fig. 1.3 ). Most countries experienced longev-
ity gains in the range of 5 to 10 years. Eight countries, including China, Indonesia, 
and Vietnam, realized a gain of more than 25 years in life expectancy at birth during 
the 45-year period. Overall, the relationship between the magnitude of longevity 
gains and income level is an inverse U shape. Middle-income countries tended to 
experience greater gains than did low- and high-income countries (  table 1.2 ).  
 Even though many countries have experienced improvements in population 
health and longevity, appreciable disparities remain. A widely used if imperfect 
measure of a country ’ s economic well-being is the gross domestic product (GDP) 
per capita of population. Underlying the comparison of per capita GDP and longev-
ity is the notion that higher income leads to better health. Of course, causality runs 
in the opposite direction as well: better health leads to higher income. Although

we draw a conceptual distinction here, in practice, the relationship truly works in 
both directions. 
 Countries with higher national income as reflected in their per capita GDP 
tend to have a higher life expectancy at birth (  fig 1.4 ). The relationship is nonlinear 
in that the slope depicting the relationship between per capita GDP and life expec-
tancy is much higher at levels below about $4,000 per capita GDP than at levels 
above this. Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a measure used to compare the equiva-
lent purchasing power of a dollar in various countries and is a more accurate 
measure for this purpose than are exchange rates of countries ’ currencies.  
 The circles in   figure 1.4  represent a country ’ s population size. Thus, the 
circles are relatively large for China, India, and the United States. When the circle 
for a country is above the curve depicting the average relationship between longev-
ity and per capita GDP, the country ’ s life expectancy is above average, given the 
country ’ s per capita GDP, and conversely. Thus, in 2000, Japan, Italy, Spain, and 
Mexico had a higher life expectancy than one would expect based on each country ’ s 
output per person. Conversely, the United States, and especially Russia and the 
Union of South Africa, were below average. China and India were about at the 
average for their per capita GDPs. 
 The poor performance of South Africa can be attributed in part to large dif-
ferences in income between the country ’ s black majority and white minority. 
Inequality in health within countries is by no means unique to South Africa but 
typifies several European countries (see, e.g.,  Mackenbach, Stirbu, Roskam, et al.

2008 ) and the United States as well. Huge disparities in health among countries 
globally are a major concern, as are disparities within countries. 
 Several factors underlie the relationship between per capita GDP and longev-
ity. Among these are improvements in sanitation, better nutrition, and greater 
availability of medical care ( Cutler, Deaton, and Lleras-Muney 2006 ). In sum, two 
stylized facts are the major global improvements in population health and longev-
ity, coupled with substantial variation in population health within and among 
countries. These stylized facts raise several important issues for health economists 
to explore. For example, to what extent does the provision of personal health ser-
vices contribute to improved population health? And how much do the organiza-
tion and financing of health services contribute to variation in productivity of 
personal health care services, measured in terms of various population health 
indicators? 
 Expansion of Health Sectors 
 The most widely used quantitative indicator of a country ’ s national output is its 
GDP, which measures the market value of all final goods and services produced in 
a country in a given year. In essence, GDP is a measure of the size of the economic

pie. A country ’ s national output can be allocated to various activities, such as 
housing, food, transportation, health care, education, and national defense. Thus, 
the share of GDP allocated to health care is a measure of the size of a country ’ s 
health sector relative to its national output. 
 During the past several decades, many countries have experienced major 
expansions in the size of their health sectors, as measured by the share of GDP 
spent on health care. In the United States, the share of GDP allocated to health care 
tripled over 4.5 decades, from 5.1 percent in 1960 to 15.3 percent in 2006. During 
the same period, this share increased from 3.9 percent to 8.4 percent in the United 
Kingdom (  fig. 1.5 ). Although different countries experienced a similar positive 
trend in health care spending, there are substantial variations among countries. In 
2006, the share of GDP allocated to health care ranged from 1.9 percent to 17.7 
percent for 175 countries globally (  table 1.3 ).  
 A country ’ s share of GDP allocated to health care is positively associated with 
its income level, suggesting that health care is a  “ normal good ” (the term used in 
economics to mean that consumption of the good rises with increases in income). 
People are willing to pay more relative to other consumption goods to be in good 
health when they become more affluent ( Hall and Jones 2007 ). Consequently, eco-
nomic growth is an important determinant of health sector size. In addition to 
income, several other factors, among them technological change in medicine, popu-
lation aging, and the implementation of health insurance, have contributed to the 
growth in real health care spending, where  “ real ” refers to spending relative to the 
prices of all goods and services.

 Introduction and Overview
 As the health sector has expanded, there has been growing public concern 
about both efficiency and equity in health services delivery.  Efficiency  refers to 
how society uses its given resources to maximize the welfare of its members;  equity 
refers to how society distributes its goods and services among its members. Con-
cerns about efficiency and equity in any sector raise some major questions: Which, 
how, and for whom will health services be produced? That is, which health services 
are to be produced, and in what quantities? How, utilizing which technologies, are 
health services to be produced? Who will use those health services that are pro-
duced? In particular, technological change in medicine often increases the gap 
between what medicine can do and what it is economically feasible to do ( Fuchs 
2000 ). 
 1.3 
 Important Institutional Features of Health 
Care 
 While the health care sectors of countries have unique features, there are also many 
similarities. Following are some of the similarities. First, the sectors ’ outputs are 
consumed by individuals. These outputs tend to rival in consumption. This means, 
for example, if one of us receives an x-ray, that same x-ray cannot be consumed by 
someone else. By contrast, some goods, such as national defense and public health, 
are  public goods . These goods are not rival in that consumption of the safety from 
a strong national defense or public health policy by one individual does not reduce 
the potential for others to consume the goods. The health sector encompasses some 
public goods, in particular those deriving from biomedical research and public

health programs. However, in terms of dollar value, personal health care services 
dominate. Second, as with the vast majority of other goods and services, decision 
making about the use of personal health care services is highly decentralized. Each 
day, hundreds of millions of individuals around the world make decisions about 
the use of health services. 
 Third, suppliers of health services respond to financial and nonfinancial 
incentives as do suppliers of other goods and services. Just because a country ’ s 
health system is government-run does not mean that individual suppliers are not 
responsive to incentives. Physicians paid a fixed salary by the government are 
likely to take account of the fact that an extra hour of work is not likely to result 
in higher compensation in deciding whether or not they will stay late to serve those 
patients in the waiting room after official closing time. 
 Given these similarities, many aspects of health economics are amenable to 
study using the same methods that microeconomists use to study behaviors in other 
markets. Health economics is a subfield of applied microeconomics. Students of 
health economics are helped by courses in labor economics, public economics, 
industrial organization, and econometrics, and conversely, the study of health 
economics can be helpful for students in the other applied microeconomic 
fields. 
 On the other hand, health care also has more unique features, more than we 
can consider here. These features are not necessarily unique to health care, but 
taken in combination, they do account for ways in which health care services are 
financed and delivered. Three important features are health insurance, externali-
ties, and asymmetric information. 
 Health Insurance 
 The use of personal health care services is to some extent random because the onset 
of illness is random. As a result, risk-averse individuals, presumably most persons, 
seek to reduce expenditure risk by obtaining health insurance. Because health 
insurance reduces personal expenditure risk, owing to the stochastic nature of 
illness, risk-averse people are better off with insurance. Both public and private 
insurance provide protection against expenditure risk. 
 While insurance improves a person ’ s well-being by providing protection 
against loss in the event of illness, by lowering the price individuals pay out of 
pocket for personal health care services, consumption decisions are distorted. 
When there are no externalities, a topic to be discussed below, consumption of any 
good or service is optimal when use is at the level at which the marginal value of 
such services to consumers equals the marginal cost of supplying the good or 
service. However, health insurance lowers the out-of-pocket price, which in turn 
increases the quantity of personal health services demanded — a phenomenon 
called  moral hazard . Given the reduced price to consumers and the resulting 
increase in the quantity of services demanded, use may increase to a level at which 

12 
 Introduction and Overview
marginal cost is far above the marginal value of such services to consumers. If so, 
there is a misallocation of resources in that the value consumers place on the 
service is less than the cost of producing another unit of the service. 
 To see this, imagine that medical care is provided to consumers at a zero 
out-of-pocket price. Then consumers will use medical care up to the point at 
which the last unit of service consumed has a zero value. But the cost of pro-
ducing that last unit of service is likely to be far more than zero. Having output 
at a level at which the marginal valuation to consumers is less than the marginal 
cost represents a misallocation of scarce resources. Consumer well-being from 
available scarce resources could be increased by decreasing the output of the 
service. 
 Various ways of reducing moral hazard are employed by both government 
and private organizations. One alternative is to limit the supply of health resources. 
Another is to monitor the utilization of personal health care services, disallowing 
insurance coverage for services considered to be of low marginal value. Still 
another is to increase cost sharing, that is, the share of the payment to the provider 
that the insured consumer bears. While increased cost sharing increases expendi-
ture risk, it reduces moral hazard. Some have argued that individuals in the United 
States are overinsured in that at the prevailing rates of insurance coverage, the 
societal loss in well-being attributable to moral hazard exceeds the gains in well-
being that the coverage provides in terms of expenditure risk protection (see, e.g., 
 Feldstein 1973 ), but there is no consensus on this issue. 
 Another problem, largely limited to private health insurance markets, is 
 adverse selection . Adverse selection may arise when consumers know more about 
their own health risks, and hence their future use of personal health care services, 
than insurers do. Suppose you were just told by a doctor that you have cancer. Or 
even without going to a doctor, you feel pain in your chest when walking up a 
couple of flights of steps. Your first thoughts are likely to be about your health and 
your own longevity. But your second thought is likely to be about your health 
insurance coverage. If you can, you would like to purchase a comprehensive insur-
ance policy covering large health care expenses. By contrast, if you are a jogger 
and a nonsmoker, you may figure that you will remain healthy, and be more inter-
ested in purchasing jogging shoes, memberships in health clubs, and bicycles than 
in purchasing comprehensive health insurance policies. 
 Adverse selection can lead consumers who are healthier to eschew high-cost, 
complete health insurance coverage or eschew coverage altogether, leaving the 
market to individuals at higher risk for adverse health outcomes. In theory, adverse 
selection can lead to the unraveling of insurance markets ( Rothschild and Stiglitz 
1976 ). Not knowing each insured ’ s health risk, insurers frequently do not charge 
sufficiently different premiums to high- versus low-risk individuals. Thus, for any 
premium that allows the insurer to break even, insurance is an attractive purchase 

Introduction and Overview 
 13
for the high- but not the low-risk individuals. Thus, fewer low-risk persons demand 
insurance. 
 To break even on the remaining persons it covers, the insurer must raise 
premiums. But at the higher premium, some people who bought insurance before 
decide against buying insurance. These are the lower-risk of the higher-risk persons 
who purchased insurance last year. Again, with the sicker pool of insureds, the 
insurer finds that its premium income is insufficient. So it raises premiums again. 
The healthier persons in this group drop out of the insurance market. This process 
of unraveling continues until only a very few high-risk individuals remain in the 
market. All the rest of the population is made worse off because they have lost a 
mechanism for reducing expenditure risk at premiums that are appropriate for the 
health expenditures they are likely to incur.  
 There are several approaches for dealing with adverse selection. One is 
to eliminate a choice of insurance plans entirely, which occurs when govern-
ment provides a single insurance plan. Lack of choice, however, may be welfare 
reducing in its own right in that less risk-averse persons would purchase less 
comprehensive policies than would more risk-averse individuals if choices were 
available. 
 Another option is to develop and implement improved methods of predicting 
each individual ’ s future use of personal health care services. In this way, the infor-
mation asymmetry between buyers and sellers of insurance is reduced. This is 
called  risk adjustment . 
 Externalities and Government Intervention in Health Care 
Services Provision 
 For the vast majority of goods and services, including many personal health ser-
vices, the benefit from consumption accrues exclusively to the individual consum-
ing the good or service and his or her family. However, for an important subset of 
health care services, the benefits of consumption extend beyond the household. 
These  externalities in consumption have important implications for how health 
care is financed and produced. 
 When making private decisions, consumers may not consider the effects of 
their consumption decisions on others. This may be true in deciding whether or 
not to obtain a vaccination to prevent an infectious disease — pure health externali-
ties  for which consumption by person A has a direct potential effect on whether 
or not person B contracts the disease. If you obtain a vaccination before you travel, 
you not only protect yourself against the disease, you protect the passengers who 
sit next to you on a bus, train, or airplane as well. Particularly since the passengers 
are likely to be strangers, you will probably not consider the effect on these strang-
ers when you decide whether or not to get the shot. However, from society ’ s vantage 
point, the benefit to strangers is consequential. If people consider only benefits to 

14 
 Introduction and Overview
themselves, their consumption of personal health care services that have health 
externalities will be suboptimal, that is, too low. Health externalities provide the 
rationale for a wide variety of public health programs, ranging from malaria eradi-
cation to the provision of flu vaccines to adults and several different types of 
immunizations to children. 
 A second type is a  financial externality . When person C smokes and subse-
quently contracts lung cancer, which is not contagious, because of risk pooling in 
the form of health insurance, person D may end up paying for person C ’ s treatment 
for this cancer. To make smokers take account of financial externalities, govern-
ments may impose an excise tax on cigarettes. 
 A third type of externality is more subtle and falls in the category of consump-
tion externalities. In most countries, there is a broad consensus that each person 
should have access to at least minimal levels of personal health care services, just 
as there is a widespread consensus that young children should be able to consume 
milk. If person E sees person F collapse on the street, for purely altruistic reasons 
person E may feel better if person F has immediate access to an ambulance and 
emergency care. The ambulance service and emergency care are  merit wants —
 goods or services that generate externalities in consumption only because people 
think that in a just society, people should be able to consume the good or service. 
For this reason, to continue our example, the government may supply ambulance 
services or emergency care for all or for persons with low income at a price well 
below the cost of production. Absent government intervention, output levels of 
merit wants may be too low and access of the poor to such goods and services too 
limited. 
 Still another type of externality relates to  public goods.  As briefly described 
above, a good is public if it is nonrival in consumption. That is, consumption by 
person G does not exclude consumption by person H of that same good or service. 
For example, if G receives a physician visit, that same visit cannot be provided to 
H. But the use of scientific findings in treating G in no way limits H ’ s benefit from 
these same findings. The public good feature of biomedical research provides the 
rationale for public subsidies and sometimes the public provision of such research 
(research conducted in government laboratories). It also provides the rationale for 
granting patent protection to firms engaged in such research as an alternative to 
government subsidy. 
 If there are no externalities and the good or service is rival in consumption, 
consumer information is good, and there are no scale economies in production, an 
important conclusion of economics is that competitive forces lead to provision of 
the good or service at socially optimal output levels. Further, under competition, 
socially optimal levels of quality are provided at the level at which consumers ’ 
marginal willingness to pay for additional quality equals the marginal cost of sup-
plying it. However, in markets in which competition does not prevail but rather 
suppliers are able to exercise market power, price may greatly exceed marginal 

Introduction and Overview 
 15
cost, and as a result, output will be below its socially optimal level. Among the 
remedies for market power is  antitrust policy . 
 Many countries have limited the role of competition by implementing the 
public provision of services or by leaving the market in private hands but limiting 
private sellers ’ ability to set product prices by, for example, implementing price 
controls or fixing prices for the health care goods and services that government 
purchases. Under such circumstances, competitive forces cannot operate to produce 
socially desirable outcomes. Government intervention may be justified when the 
preconditions required for competitive forces to yield socially desirable outcomes 
do not prevail, for example when consumer information is poor, there are barriers 
to entry, or there are economies of scale in production. 
 Asymmetric Information between Consumers and Suppliers of 
Health Care and the Institutional Responses 
 Asymmetric information  is present when one party to a transaction has information 
pertinent to the transaction that another party does not possess. For example, a 
company executive is likely to have information on an imminent company 
announcement about the profit it earned last quarter. This announcement is likely 
to be followed by changes in demand for the company ’ s stock, an increase if the 
news is good and a decrease if the news is bad. Absent rules or regulations to 
prohibit this, the executive might buy or sell his stock in the company depending 
on the nature of the news to be announced. In this example, the executive has 
information relevant to a stock transaction that traders on the outside do not have. 
Adverse selection in insurance markets is another example. Here the insurance 
purchaser has private information that the insurer does not have. 
 A key attribute of health care is that the supplier of health care services often, 
if not typically, possesses information about a disease or its treatment that the 
patient does not have. Such asymmetric information is a potentially important 
source of market power for physicians. 
 A prerequisite for competition to prevail in a market is that consumers have 
good information. Health care consumers may lack sufficient information to make 
informed choices. One response of an uninformed consumer is to seek the advice 
of a physician. In fact, one of the fundamental services physicians supply to their 
patients is conveying information. Ideally, physicians would provide unbiased 
information to their patients. But a difficulty arises under conditions of asymmetric 
knowledge, for physicians may exploit the information asymmetry. 
 Society has designed a wide variety of ways to deal with the information 
asymmetry.  Professional norms  are designed to combat any tendency physicians 
might have to take advantage of their superior information. Medical school gradu-
ates take the Hippocratic oath, in which the oath taker promises to act in his or 
her patients ’ interests. While acting in patients ’ interest is an ideal, in practice, 
professional norms operate imperfectly because the strong financial motives to 

16 
 Introduction and Overview
supply profitable services may lead some physicians to take advantage of patients 
by exploiting the information asymmetry. Furthermore, what is in the patient ’ s 
interest may not be very clear given uncertainties in patients ’ diagnoses and in the 
effects of various therapies. Not only is the effect of therapy often uncertain, there 
is often substantial heterogeneity in the effects of treatments. Owing to genetic and 
other factors, the same drug has different effects in different individuals. A surgical 
procedure likewise can differ in effectiveness, and the underlying probability of 
adverse effects of surgery is likely to differ among individuals as well, both because 
patients differ and because surgeons differ in their ability to perform the 
procedure. 
 Aside from implementing professional norms, which largely rely on the self-
regulation of behavior, countries have implemented public and quasi-public regula-
tions to cope with asymmetric information, as well as private institutional 
arrangements. Professional and institutional licensure and certification fall in the 
former category. Physicians must be licensed before they can practice medicine. 
Institutional licensure includes licensure of hospitals. Laws allow for the formation 
of private nonprofit hospitals, organizations that are not organized for the purpose 
of maximizing profits for shareholders ( Sloan 2000 ). 
 In recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on educating health care 
consumers about their options. This has taken the form of direct-to-consumer 
advertising of prescription drugs ( Berndt and Donohue 2008 ) and report cards on 
the performance of hospitals ( Gowrisankaran 2008 ). Even though information pro-
vision also has potential pitfalls — for example, direct-to-consumer advertising may 
give the seller more market power — such advertising may also help consumers 
know more about their treatment options. 
 Physicians become knowledgeable about the efficacy of treatments by reading 
articles in professional journals, enrolling in continuing medical education pro-
grams, listening to sales representatives of pharmaceutical manufacturers, and 
discussing treatments with colleagues. Given the rapid rate of technological change, 
evidence on efficacy is always changing. Thus, physicians, other health profession-
als, and health care administrators use various approaches to acquire knowledge 
about recent technological developments.

 Government Intervention in Health Care 
Markets 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) at one time ranked countries ’ health systems 
in terms of their performance. These rankings reflected the performance of the 
public sector of the countries in health care as well as other factors. The WHO

indicates that it no longer produces a ranking table because of the complexity of 
the task. 
 Although individual rankings can be debated, it is noteworthy that France, 
Italy, Spain, Austria, and Japan were in the top ten of the WHO ’ s ranking in 2000. 
The United States ranked thirty-seventh, which was about the same ranking as 
Canada, Finland, Australia, Slovenia, and Cuba. In the bottom ten, ranked 181 – 190, 
were low-income countries, mainly in Africa.   
 Government ’ s Roles in Achieving an Equitable Distribution of 
Resources 
 Governments throughout the world have been more active in health care than in 
most other sectors of their economies. High levels of government activity in health 
care have created substantial demand for policy analysis by health economists. 
 A major reason for government intervention is redistributive. The underlying 
notion is that in just societies, people should have minimal access to certain goods, 
irrespective of their ability to pay. Historically, such goods were provided by 
private philanthropy, but apparently in insufficient amounts, providing a rationale 
for government intervention. Absent government intervention, market forces may 
lead to a situation in which less affluent populations and populations disadvan-
taged for other reasons, such as geographic remoteness of locations at which health 
services are delivered relative to where persons work and live, may have inade-
quate access to personal health care services. Governments have a choice whether 
or not to transfer resources to disadvantaged populations in the form of income or 
in kind transfers.

 Introduction and Overview
 Economists typically prefer income transfers, leaving it to the recipients of 
the transfers to allocate the subsidies in a way that maximizes well-being from the 
household ’ s perspective ( Currie and Gahvari 2008 ). However, for merit wants, 
societies clearly prefer to redistribute in kind out of a concern that households will 
underconsume the very goods and services to which societies attach the highest 
priority. Income transfers may be allocated to other goods and services instead of 
physician visits and other types of personal health care services. 
 Countries differ in how in-kind transfers are made. Many countries mainly 
rely on direct provision through public clinics and hospitals. Some high-income 
countries, including the UK, Denmark, Norway, and New Zealand, as well as low-
income countries, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, rely on direct government 
provision of personal health care services. Governments subsidize the production 
of personal health care services in the form of free clinics and hospitals. 
 In countries with limited resources, there may be few government-sponsored 
facilities, and the few that exist may be geographically remote from much of the 
country ’ s population. Because of the high cost, many persons may obtain care only 
after their diseases have reached an advanced stage, if they receive care at all. 
Facilities receive budgetary allocations from the government on a regular basis. 
The limiting factors are the facilities ’ budgets and physical plant. Higher-income 
persons may obtain care from private providers who are not subsidized by the 
government. 
 Some countries have single-payer government financing, combined with 
private provision. Health insurance is provided as social insurance. In these coun-
tries, insurance coverage is universal or nearly so and provided without regard to 
a person ’ s ability to pay. Examples of countries with single-payer systems are 
Canada and Taiwan. In Germany, which has had a social insurance system for 
health care since the late nineteenth century, coverage of employees below a certain 
monthly salary is mandated by law. Although such health insurance is provided 
by private sick funds, coverage attributes are subject to strict government oversight 
and regulation. For persons not employed, there is welfare-based insurance cover-
age similar to Medicaid in the United States. 
 A third alternative is the private provision of insurance, as is common in the 
United States. However, even in the United States, about half of expenditures on 
personal health services are financed by public funds. 
 The Equity-Efficiency Quandary and Government ’ s Role 
 While there is a broad consensus that some redistribution of resources is appropri-
ate, there is no consensus on either the proper amount of redistribution or how 
this should be accomplished. Also, in seeking to redistribute resources, there has 
been an unfortunate tendency on the part of some to view public policies as almost 
entirely redistributional and to ignore the effects of public policies on health care 
resource allocation. 

Introduction and Overview 
 19
 Public policies can also have important potential effects on incentives indi-
viduals face as health care consumers, as household decision makers more gener-
ally, and as suppliers of health care. Before defining the economic concept of 
 efficiency  more precisely, we supply a few examples to help set the stage. 
 To ensure that poor families have access to personal health care services, from 
the standpoint of equity, it may be desirable to provide such families with a gov-
ernment-paid health insurance policy. However, if one has to be poor to receive 
this benefit, the cost to a family of engaging in work for pay can become prohibi-
tively high. Not only is the publicly financed health insurance policy potentially 
lost but the family faces the prospect of paying for health insurance privately, 
clearly a disincentive to engage in market work. 
 There is a widespread misperception among some that the government can 
cut fees to physicians by a given percentage without there being any effect on the 
supply of physicians ’ services, or cut prices of pharmaceutical products by this 
amount or more without having an effect on pharmaceutical research and develop-
ment. But as fees decrease, physicians may reduce the time they supply to the 
market, and, for private funds to be allocated to investments in research and devel-
opment, pharmaceutical manufacturers must be able to count on a return that 
covers their cost of capital. 
 The social insurance model of health insurance provision has advantages in 
helping countries achieve a fairer distribution of income; moreover, the provision 
of such insurance improves individuals ’ well-being by reducing out-of-pocket 
expenditure risk as well. However, when public insurance is subsidized by com-
pulsory payments, such as through a payroll tax, such taxes may distort decisions 
people make in allocating time to market work versus time spent in other 
pursuits. 
 Efficiency has two meanings in economics. One is the usual meaning, which 
is referred to as  technical efficiency  ( Leibenstein 1966 ). If a unit of output can be 
produced with two units of labor and three units of capital, producing the unit 
with more inputs, for example with three units of labor and four units of capital, 
would be technically inefficient. Technical efficiency issues have been raised in 
the context of health care just as they have been raised elsewhere. For example, an 
issue in a health care context is whether or not for-profit hospitals are more tech-
nically efficient than hospitals run by the government or private nonprofit 
organizations. 
 The other type of efficiency, which is used more often in economics than 
technical efficiency, is  allocative efficiency . The three examples above of the 
equity-efficiency trade-off refer to allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency 
describes a situation in which scarce resources are allocated in a way that maxi-
mizes social well-being given society ’ s resource endowment. In the production 
process, this is done so that the ratios of each input ’ s marginal product to its piece 
are equal in all inputs. 

20 
 Introduction and Overview
 Households are endowed with a fixed amount of time to allocate among 
various market and nonmarket (e.g., time spent in leisure activities, helping chil-
dren with homework) uses. Households value both leisure time and the consump-
tion of goods and services. By spending less time on leisure activities and 
correspondingly more time on market work, households gain more resources to 
allocate to consumption. If, however, the return from work is reduced because in 
the case of a physician, the fee is reduced, or for other families, public 
health insurance is withdrawn when household income increases or a payroll tax 
decreases the return from work, public policies distort incentives to engage in 
market work. 
 Both because redistributive effects of public policies are more readily 
understood by the public and because they are often easier to quantify than are 
allocative distortions, the redistributive aspects of public policies often receive 
greater public notice. On the other hand, economists have a strong theoretical 
framework for evaluating economic efficiency, much more so than for assessing 
the adequacy of a particular income distribution. For this reason, economists 
tend to emphasize the efficiency aspects of public policies. Assessing equity and 
the equity-efficiency trade-offs involves making value judgments and adopting 
assessment approaches, which economists tend to feel rather uncomfortable 
doing. 
 Much of economic analysis  and  this book is concerned with efficiency 
rather than equity issues. Lack of emphasis does not reflect a belief that equity 
concerns are unimportant, just that we economists do not believe we have as 
much to say about them. Although it is feasible to do this, technical efficiency is 
better judged by experts in specific technologies, such as engineers, than by 
economists. 
 Government ’ s Role in Correcting Market Failures 
 In the presence of externalities, asymmetric information, and supply-side imperfec-
tions, such as barriers to entry, private markets in general and competition in 
particular cannot achieve a socially optimal allocation of resources. In economic 
jargon, absent some type of government intervention,  markets fail  to achieve a 
social optimum. While government may cause distortions, a common allegation in 
political discourse, it may also correct distortions that occur absent government 
intervention. Externalities may be corrected by tax and government transfer poli-
cies or by regulations that require private parties to undertake various precautions, 
for example that a child be vaccinated before enrolling in school or that a manu-
facturer eliminate or reduce pollutants arising from the manufacturing process. 
Incompetent or unethical physicians may be eliminated from the market by requir-
ing that physicians have licenses. Antitrust policy may be a counterweight to 
private attempts to monopolize a market.

 The Book ’ s Four Parts: A Road Map 
 Structure of the Book 
 The structure of this book is similar to the paradigm of economic analysis, begin-
ning with consumers on the demand side and then shifting to firms on the supply 
side of the market. After analyzing decisions at the individual and firm level in 
the second through tenth chapters, we devote three chapters to market-level analy-
sis, which incorporates the simultaneous responses of participants on both demand 
and supply sides of the market. While most of the book deals with positive eco-
nomics, that is, modeling the responses of market participants to the various incen-
tives they face, two chapters deal expressly with normative issues, in particular 
decisions by governments about which services to cover based on comparisons of 
the benefits and costs of specific technologies. 
 This analysis is followed by chapters on the relationship of investments in 
health and health care to economic growth, and on the frontiers of health econom-
ics. A road map to the four parts of the book is shown graphically in   figure 1.6 .  
 Part I analyzes three types of decisions commonly made by individuals: (1) 
decisions about their demand for health and other consumption behaviors that

 Introduction and Overview
affect health, (2) decisions about the amounts and types of personal health care 
services demanded, (3) individuals ’ demand for health insurance coverage. 
 Part II assesses the decision making of each major participant on the supply 
side of health care markets — physicians, nurses, hospitals, and pharmaceutical 
manufacturers. An important feature of health care is the key roles played by 
private and public insurers in decisions made at the level of individual decision 
makers. Hence, we consider both demand and supply of private insurance, as well 
as decision making by public insurers and the choices societies make in setting up 
their public health insurance plans. 
 Countries make important choices about how personal health care services 
are financed and about the types of organizations that supply those services, the 
topic of Part III. One important choice about financing involves whether the country 
will rely on public financing of personal health care services or allow or encourage 
private insurance markets. Another important choice is whether or not the country 
is to rely on government provision of services, privately provided services by not-
for-profit or for-profit organizations, or some combination of public and private 
provision. These are not easy choices; Part III describes the pros and cons of the 
alternatives. Our goal is to provide a framework for analyzing specific types of 
health care systems. To accommodate students ’ needs for specific information 
about particular countries, we provide links to specific websites. 
 Finally, Part IV provides a direct link between health economics and public 
policy, starting with descriptions of economic approaches for program evaluation —
 how the costs and benefits of various investments in health should be quantified. 
This subject should be particularly interesting to students in public policy, phar-
macy, and medicine since demands for evaluations of specific health care technolo-
gies occur most frequently in these contexts. Another important public policy issue 
relates to the size of the health care sector. Is there a particular size of a health 
sector that is  “ too large ” ? Too large often is interpreted as meaning that beyond 
some point, further spending on personal health care services is largely wasteful. 
There is an alternative argument that expenditures on such services contribute to 
a country ’ s economic growth, and furthermore, as countries become more affluent, 
they demand higher levels of health and health care services for this reason. A 
chapter in Part IV is devoted to this set of issues. The last chapter summarizes the 
book by focusing on five major controversies in health economics, all of which 
have important consequences for public policy and future health economics 
research. 
 A brief description of the contents of each chapter follows. 
 Part I 
 Demand for Health, Health Care Services, and Insurance 
 Part I focuses on the demand side of the market for personal health care services. 
Demand decisions may be divided into decisions individuals make before becom-
ing ill (ex ante) and those made after becoming ill (ex post). Ex ante decisions 

Introduction and Overview 
 23
involve choices about health behaviors, the use of preventive services, and insur-
ance purchases. Health behaviors and the use of preventive care affect the probabil-
ity of becoming ill. In economics, problems are solved by backward induction. 
Hence, in making decisions about prevention, the individual takes account of the 
consequences of taking or not taking care of him- or herself. 
 Although markets for private health insurance are small or nonexistent in 
some countries, it is still important to understand why people demand insurance, 
even if you live in one of these countries. Publicly provided insurance also fulfills 
the basic goal of insurance coverage, to protect people against the risk of high out-
of-pocket expenditures on personal health services. 
 People consume personal health care services and engage in healthy behav-
iors because they are better off when they are in good health. However, being in 
good health is generally not individuals ’ only objective in life. The consumption 
of other goods and services is also of value. Some of these goods are productive in 
making people healthy, such as eating nutritious foods. The consumption of others 
may yield enjoyment, such as the consumption of tobacco products, but detract 
from health. In general, the consumption of personal health care services means 
fewer personal resources are available for consuming other goods and services. 
 Chapter 2 focuses on the personal demand for health and the consumption 
of personal health services and health behaviors as  derived demands . An indi-
vidual  “ produces ”  his or her own health, employing combinations of personal 
health services and health behaviors. The relationship between these inputs and 
health outcomes is given by a health production function. Given the product tech-
nology and prices of input and such exogenous factors as the person ’ s genetic 
makeup, revealed as one ages, individuals make decisions about their health and 
the levels of the health inputs they  “ employ. ”  Typically, the relationship between 
inputs and health outcomes for an individual is uncertain. Decision analysts have 
developed decision trees, which are a useful tool for analyzing decisions made 
under conditions of uncertainty. Decision trees describe production function rela-
tionships. Utilities the decision maker attaches to various outcomes are elicited as 
an integral part of the decision-making process. Inputs, such as how often to visit 
a physician and whether or not to get a flu shot, take a drug, or smoke, and output 
choices  — expected levels of future health, are made to maximize the individual ’ s 
expected utility. 
 The expected utility maximization framework of decision making has been 
the traditional approach that economists use to analyze decisions made under 
conditions of uncertainty. This traditional framework has been challenged, and a 
new subfield,  behavioral economics , has emerged. We discuss the behavioral eco-
nomics critique and empirical evidence the critics cite in support of these 
arguments. 
 Chapter 3 describes the theory of and empirical evidence on the relationship 
between the quantity of health services demanded and the out-of-pocket price of 

24 
 Introduction and Overview
such services. We discuss methods researchers have used to study the demand for 
personal health care and the findings of these studies. In particular, we focus on 
empirical evidence on the effects of such variables as out-of-pocket money prices 
and  time prices — time allocated for consuming a unit of a good or service — on the 
demand for personal health services. 
 In chapter 3, the individual ’ s health insurance coverage, either by a private 
or by a public insurance plan, is taken as given. Relying on the concept of expected 
utility maximization, chapter 4 presents the economic framework for analyzing an 
individual ’ s demand for insurance and empirical evidence on factors affecting 
individuals ’  demand for health insurance coverage. As with other goods and ser-
vices, an individual ’ s demand for private insurance partly depends on its price. 
The price of insurance is not shown on a sticker as is the price of many other goods, 
such as shirts and ties and automobiles. A major objective of chapter 4 is to explain 
the concept of price of insurance. We show how using an expected utility frame-
work, people can be better off with than without insurance. 
 In the presence of asymmetric information, in this case consumers knowing 
more than insurance companies about their future health and hence their potential 
use of personal health care services, certain types of insurance may become unavail-
able. Insurers do not have information on the individual ’ s health care consumption 
intentions initially and thus do not charge those persons who expect to be sick a 
premium sufficiently high to cover the high expected use of services. Selection is 
adverse in that insurers do not charge a sufficiently high premium and therefore 
lose money on those insured individuals who expect to be high users. 
 Part II 
 Supply of Health Care Services and Insurance 
 The major suppliers of personal health care services are physicians, nurses, hos-
pitals, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, in some countries, private 
insurers offer coverage of personal health care services. Part II analyzes the behav-
ior of these suppliers. 
 The physician is the captain of the health care team. Reflecting public law 
and regulation, physicians are the only providers of some health care services, such 
as surgery. Moreover, physicians provide medical advice to their patients and often 
direct the activities of nonphysician providers of health care services. Chapter 5 is 
about the market for physicians and physicians ’ services. 
 The supply of physicians ’ services depends on career decisions that physi-
cians make, as well as decisions they make about their practices, including pricing, 
hours of work, the mix of services they provide, and the types of patients they 
accept for care. Physicians make several important decisions about their careers: 
(1) whether or not to become a physician, (2) the choice of specialty, (3) geographic 
location, and (4) type of practice (independent solo, group, or salaried practice). 
 Important issues about physicians ’ career choices discussed in chapter 5 are: 
(1) How important are financial incentives in the choice of medicine as a career, 

Introduction and Overview 
 25
choice specialty, and practice location? (2) How do physicians select practice types, 
and in turn, how do the incentives associated with each affect physician incen-
tives? These questions are important in every country. 
 In contrast to many but not all other sectors in the economy,  1 the physician 
is an agent for the patient. Particularly since the physician is in a position to rec-
ommend care that he or she subsequently provides and may profit from by provid-
ing, some health economists and health policy researchers from other disciplines 
have expressed doubt that many aspects of the physicians ’ services market can be 
properly understood by applying analytic methods common in other fields of 
microeconomics, in which consumers can be assumed to be sufficiently knowl-
edgeable about the goods being consumed (  box 1.1 ).  
 A major learning objective of chapter 5 is to understand the role of agency 
and the model developed to reflect asymmetric information between patients and 
their physicians. We describe alternative models of behavior, consider stylized facts 
of the physicians ’ services markets that the alternatives can explain that more 
traditional models cannot explain, provide a critique of these alternative models, 
and summarize empirical tests and the findings of studies that have evaluated these 
models empirically. 
 Worldwide, hospitals incorporate the latest in medical technology in a country 
and tend to care for the most seriously ill persons. An important distinguishing 
characteristic of hospitals is that relatively few are organized on a for-profit basis. 
Rather, private not-for-profit and public ownership forms are dominant. By con-
trast, an important article by Kenneth  Arrow (1963 ) explains existing widespread 
institutional arrangements in health care markets as second-best alternatives. For 
example, the first-best option would be to insure health. However, absent the fea-
sibility of this, consumers require other protections, which, for example, nonprofit 
ownership of hospitals presumably provides. Whether or not not-for-profit hospi-
tals indeed perform better than their for-profit counterparts is an empirical ques-
tion, examined in this book in chapter 6. 
 Several interesting and important questions follow from the observation that 
in contrast to other sectors and parts of the health care sector, such as pharmaceuti-
cal manufacturers, for-profit hospital organizations are in the minority. Why are 
the other forms dominant in the hospital sector? Are for-profit hospitals more or 
less efficient than hospitals organized as private nonprofit or public entities? Do 
for-profit hospitals provide lower or higher quality of care? 
 In all countries, physicians are an important part of the production process 
in hospitals. However, physicians in some countries, mostly notably in the United 
States, typically are not employed by the hospitals in which they work. Rather, 
they work in hospitals as self-employed agents and, in important ways, rather than 
report to hospital officials, the hospital officials report to them. We describe a 
model in which physicians run the hospitals to serve their own collective 
interest.

 Introduction and Overview
 Box 1.1 
 Two Classic Studies in Health Economics 
 An issue that arose during the early years of the field of health economics and persists 
to some extent today is whether or not health and health care services are fundamen-
tally different from other goods and services, requiring fundamentally different analy-
sis, or whether health and health care services are fundamentally the same but with 
some important nuances and subject to analysis with standard economic tools — with 
the tools evolving and improving over time. 
 In other words, is health care basically  “ a wolf in sheep ’ s clothing ” or  “ a sheep in 
wolf ’ s clothing? ” If a wolf in sheep ’ s clothing, relationships may not look that differ-
ent, but they are fundamentally different. The implication is that economists should 
be very cautious about applying the methods, especially the theoretical methods, that 
they learned in graduate school and on the job to study health issues. If a sheep in 
wolf ’ s clothing, things may seem basically different in this field, but they are the same 
as in other sectors after accounting for a few nuances. 
 Whether or not health care is really different has important public policy implica-
tions. The stated rationale for licensure of physicians is to protect patients from 
incompetent and self-serving physicians. More than six decades ago, a landmark 
economic study of incomes in various professions, including dentistry and medicine, 
Milton Friedman ’ s and Simon Kuznets ’ s  Income from Professional Practice  (1945), 
questioned whether licensure served the public interest or instead the collective 
financial interest of those with licenses. In addition to assembling data on national 
income in the 1930s, Kuznets had assembled data on income in various occupations, 
completing a draft in 1936. Friedman picked up the project, completing it as his PhD 
dissertation in 1945. The importance of this study for health economics was its focus 
on barriers to entry to occupations imposed by licensure and the resulting effect of 
increasing physicians ’ incomes above the level that would prevail under competition. 
Both these economists subsequently were awarded Nobel Prizes in Economics. 
 In 1958, Reuben  Kessel published an article in the first issue of the  Journal of Law 
 & Economics  on price discrimination by physicians, a common practice in the United 
States before health insurance coverage became widespread. He argued against the 
conventional wisdom, which was that multipart pricing of physicians ’ services was 
an act of charity. Rather, he argued that price discrimination reflects the exercise of 
market power by physicians. In both Friedman and Kuznets ’ book and Kessel ’ s article, 
the implication was that the motive for institutional arrangements in the markets of 
physicians ’ services was financial gain rather than consumer protection.  

Introduction and Overview 
 27
 At least as much as other types of personal health care services, hospital care 
is covered by health insurance. As a result, patients are largely insulated from the 
rising costs and prices of hospital care. To the extent they do not perform the 
role of watchdog over cost containment, countries have adopted various forms 
of public regulation to achieve hospital cost containment. These hospital cost-
containment approaches and empirical evidence on their effectiveness are dis-
cussed in chapter 6. 
 The track record of regulatory approaches in curbing inflation in health care 
cost has been mixed. Hence, there has been increased interest in relying on market-
oriented forces to achieve socially desirable outcomes. Chapter 6 evaluates the 
empirical evidence on the effects of competition among hospitals. 
 Within a product market, the quality of most goods and services tends to vary 
markedly. Heterogeneity in quality is a fact of life in markets for automobiles, 
hotels, restaurants, and clothes. In most markets, one takes for granted that people 
who wish to purchase higher quality will pay more for the product. Market forces 
eliminate products that do not offer good value for the money. At most, the role of 
government is to ensure accurate product labeling. 
 Largely because of asymmetric information between suppliers and consumers 
of health care and because quality can mean the difference between life and death, 
ensuring that the quality of health care services is above some minimum level has 
been seen as a matter of public interest and a rationale for government involvement 
in health care markets. After decades of public intervention, however, it is increas-
ingly evident that the quality of health care is not always as high as is often alleged. 
Errors frequently occur in physicians ’ offices, clinics, and hospitals, with frequent 
serious adverse consequences for patients. Chapter 7 deals with quality of care: 
how it is defined and measured in a health care context, including indicators of 
adverse outcomes patients experience while in the hospital, and regulatory mecha-
nisms, including self-regulation, that have been implemented with the ostensible 
goal of quality assurance. 
 In the United States in particular, but in some other high-income countries 
as well, medical malpractice litigation is widespread, being justified in part as a 
quality assurance mechanism. Since many readers are likely to be unfamiliar with 
tort law, the general category of law under which medical malpractice falls, chapter 
7 presents some background information on tort liability and its conceptual role 
as a quality assurance mechanism. 
 Nurses are the most numerous health professionals and have important roles 
in providing various personal health services, in particular hospital, nursing home, 
and home health care. Chapter 8 begins with an overview of labor markets for 
nurses worldwide, including a discussion of economic concepts of surplus and 
shortage and the role of monopsony power in markets for nurses. A buyer or an 
employer of an input has  monopsony power if the amount of the input that the 
buyer or employer purchases influences the price it pays for that input. For example, 

28 
 Introduction and Overview
if a hospital employs more nurses, does it have to pay a higher hourly wage to the 
nurses it hires? In a competitive labor market, the number of nurses hired would 
not influence the wage rate. 
 An important public policy issue relates to whether or not higher nurse-to-
patient ratios improve the quality of hospital care and long-term care services, and 
the advantages and disadvantages of government requirements that health care 
organizations maintain minimum ratios of nurses to patients. Chapter 8 discusses 
empirical evidence on this issue and its implications for public policy. 
 Technological changes embodied in new pharmaceutical products have been 
an important cause of improvements in health in countries at all levels of economic 
development. Pharmaceutical manufacturers as profit-maximizing firms with long 
time horizons decide on investments in new products; once products are devel-
oped, there are issues of pricing in various countries, and product promotion. Some 
manufacturers concentrate on producing generic products that are exact copies of 
existing pharmaceutical products for which patent protection has been exhausted. 
Chapter 9 focuses on the microeconomic decisions of pharmaceutical firms in 
which firms develop strategies to respond to rivals ’ decisions and to anticipated 
actions by governments, including policies related to drug approval, drug formular-
ies, and patent protection. Under some circumstances, the market may not provide 
a sufficient incentive for a sufficient supply response, for example for rare diseases, 
for diseases highly prevalent in low-income countries, or when there are externali-
ties not captured by the individual user. Various public policies to encourage 
pharmaceutical innovation when the market provides an insufficient incentive are 
described in chapter 9. 
 Chapter 10 focuses on the supply of private health insurance. The chapter 
explains how premiums are set and why insurance cycles exist. Despite wide-
spread moral hazard and adverse selection, two impediments to well-functioning 
insurance markets, insurance is generally available in countries that substantially 
rely on private financing of personal health care services. How do insurers structure 
benefits to cope with these problems? Health insurance is often employer-provided. 
What is the rationale for employer provision? Who pays for employer-provided 
coverage? This question leads to a discussion of the economics of fringe benefits. 
In all countries, insurance is subject to various forms of government regulation. 
What is the rationale, what forms does such regulation take, and what are the 
economic effects of regulation? 
 Part III 
 Market Structure in the Health Care Sector 
 Part III analyzes resource allocation arising from the interaction of three parties in 
health care markets, patients, providers, and payers, using a microeconomic meth-
odology to investigate how price and quantity are determined under various market 
structures. Based on the share of revenue from government sources and the share 
of supply operated by the public sector, a country ’ s health care markets fall into 

Introduction and Overview 
 29
four categories: (1) a cash system — out-of-pocket payment by users of services is 
the major source of financing in the health care market; (2) a private system —
 private health insurers are a major payer in the market; (3) a quasi-public (social 
insurance) system; and (4) a public system, which affords both the public provision 
of services  and  public financing. 
 Chapter 11 begins with the rationale for this classification system and alterna-
tive approaches to classifying health care systems around the world. A common 
characteristic of cash and private systems is dependence on the private sector for 
financing personal health care services. Both cash and private systems are described 
and assessed in chapter 11. Health care systems in India and China, both of which 
impose substantial cost sharing on patients, are described as examples of cash 
systems. The United States is the best example of a private system. Important to 
the US system are such concepts as capitation, managed care, selective contracting 
(which restricts the insured person ’ s choice of provider as a means for the payer 
to gain bargaining power), and managed competition. 
 Government rather than private insurers is the dominant or only payer 
in countries with quasi-public health care systems, the subject of chapter 12. 
Governments in their role as payers face several important decisions. First, how 
should payment be structured? That is, what is the unit of payment (e.g., for hos-
pitals, the patient day, the patient admission, fixed total budget)? There is a sub-
stantial amount of empirical evidence on this question. Second, should public 
payment be payment in full, or is there a role for patient supplementation of fees, 
including co-payments and reference pricing for drugs? Governments in effect set 
separate prices for providers and patients. Third, which services should be cov-
ered — brand-name pharmaceuticals or generics, devices such as implantable 
cardiac defibrillators? Chapter 12 reviews existing empirical evidence on the effects 
of these choices on the price, quantity, and quality of health care. We illustrate 
quasi-public systems with some country-specific examples, including Canada, 
China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States (Medicare and 
Medicaid). 
 Countries in still another group have health systems with both public supply 
and financing. Chapter 13 addresses the issues arising with this type of system. 
What is the economic rationale for such systems, and how do they compare to 
others in terms of both efficiency and equity? In these systems, government also 
has important choices. First, how much money should be allocated to health care 
in the aggregate? Second, how should these resources be allocated: by geography, 
by demographic group, such as for children or the elderly, or by type of care —
 preventive, curative, and palliative? Third, how should providers, such as physi-
cians, be paid? Fourth, should private supplementation of government payment be 
permitted, and if so, under what circumstances should supplementation be permit-
ted or encouraged? The chapter also provides examples of public provision in 
practice, such as the National Health Service in the UK.

 Introduction and Overview
 Part IV 
 Performance of the Health Care Sector: Positive and 
Normative Aspects 
 A number of questions will have been raised in the chapters preceding Part IV but 
not answered adequately. For example, how much should the government allocate 
to the health care sector? How should a social insurance program decide whether 
or not to adopt a new technology? What is the contribution of personal health 
services to economic growth and overall population health and longevity? Should 
there be a single tier, or should government seek to maintain some minimum level 
of health care for all and allow differences to exist? To what extent can market 
mechanisms achieve social objectives, and to what extent is government interven-
tion or direct provision desirable? 
 Whether or not a new technology should be adopted depends on both its costs 
and benefits. Several countries now use forms of cost-benefit analysis in deciding 
whether or not to cover a new technology. Such analysis can also be used to decide 
on the level of reimbursement for the technology. 
 Especially in view of the rising cost of health care, countries are increasingly 
interested in knowing whether particular health technologies are worth their cost. 
Optimal resource allocation requires that only those technologies for which benefit 
exceeds cost should be adopted. This, of course, is easier said than done. Econo-
mists and other researchers have developed methods for assessing the value of 
technologies in relationship to their cost. The three major methodologies are cost-
benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility analysis. In cost-benefit analysis, an 
approach first developed to assess the value of public expenditures, ranging from 
expenditures on parks and water projects to weapons, benefit is measured in mon-
etary terms. Benefit may be measured from demand curves for the item, such as 
for a park, but demand curves are not available for all goods and services or there 
is a judgment that demand curves would not accurately reveal consumer valua-
tions. Then other methods are used to elicit valuations from consumers or potential 
consumers. Some critics of cost-benefit analysis, mainly noneconomists, are suspi-
cious of placing value on such intangibles as the value of a life year, which is often 
done in cost-benefit analysis. 
 Chapter 14 discusses how costs should be measured in cost-benefit or cost-
effectiveness analysis. Cost measurement depends in large part on the perspective 
of the analyst. The perspective of the government will differ from that of a private 
payer. Not all relevant costs are explicit, such as the value of time spent in receipt 
of services, and we discuss alternative ways of valuing such inputs. A major task 
of chapter 14 is to describe cost-effectiveness analysis and how it has been imple-
mented in health care in practice. 
 The difference between cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-benefit analysis 
is that in the former, benefit is measured as a nonpecuniary value, whereas in 
benefit-cost analysis, the metric of benefit is cast in pecuniary terms. Benefit mea-
surement is quite complex. In a sector in which outputs have prices that result 

Introduction and Overview 
 31
from the workings of competitive market forces, the market price is an adequate 
measure of benefit. However, given market imperfections, in particular, because 
personal health care services are covered by insurance, price is not an adequate 
indicator of value or benefit. Thus, value must be imputed. 
 As described in chapter 15, the value of a life year can be inferred from market 
data. For example, the higher hourly wage paid to workers who bear an additional 
risk of death on the job (e.g., workers who wash windows of tall buildings versus 
workers with desk jobs) reflects workers ’ marginal willingness to pay to avoid the 
additional risk of death. Estimates of the added compensation from assuming 
additional personal job-related risk are used as estimates of value of life in benefit-
cost analysis. Similarly, market values of safety devices, such as devices that detect 
radon, are assumed to reflect individuals ’ willingness to pay to reduce the probabil-
ity of death. 
 An alternative approach uses estimates of maximum willingness to pay to 
avoid risk, derived from willingness-to-pay ( “ contingent valuation ” ) surveys. 
People are asked how much they would be willing to pay at most to avoid specific 
risks. As described in the chapter, each approach has its pluses and minuses. 
 In many countries, especially those with a relatively high per capita income, 
population health and longevity increased substantially over the twentieth century. 
In others, trends in health indicators are far less favorable. Improved health may 
have important benefits in terms of improving market productivity as well as being 
of value in its own right. In public discussions aimed at a lay audience, countries 
are compared based on their citizens ’ life expectancy and per capita spending on 
health care. In chapter 16, which focuses on the contribution of personal health 
services to longevity, population health, and economic growth, we argue that 
although these comparisons are easy to understand, they can also be misleading. 
In particular, they imply that countries with higher per capita spending on health 
care have inefficient health care systems. Many factors affect population and health 
and longevity. Spending on personal health care services is only one of several 
potential determinants of health and longevity. Several recent rigorous studies 
quantify the effects of personal health services in the aggregate and particular 
health services on national output or health and longevity. Chapter 16 analyzes the 
interaction between the health and economic sectors, viewing the health sector ’ s 
role in the national economy, for example, as an employer (but not only as an 
employer). How the health care system is structured has important implications 
for other macroeconomic outcomes, such as precautionary saving, labor market 
outcomes (e.g., job lock in the United States), and deadweight losses associated 
with higher rates of taxation, which may in turn discourage the entry of business 
enterprises in a country. 
 The final chapter, chapter 17, concludes our book by providing our final 
thoughts on five health economic controversies: (1) Are people and institutions 
really rational and forward-looking in decision making, as economists generally 

32 
 Introduction and Overview
assume? (2) How do people and institutions obtain information relevant to their 
decisions? To what extent does asymmetric information actually affect the perfor-
mance of health care markets, including markets for private health insurance? 
(3) How does the way that health care providers are paid and how they compete 
affect the performance of providers, and social welfare more generally? (4) How 
does the regulatory process affect the behavior of regulated health care firms? (5) 
How do physicians really make clinical decisions, and how do these clinical deci-
sions affect the substantial geographic variation in expenditures within and between 
countries? 
 1.6 
 Conclusion 
 Health economics has grown as a field for various reasons that this chapter has 
identified. Various institutional features of the health sector provide a fertile field 
for intellectual innovation.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 1.1 
 Explain the term  “ moral hazard ” in your own words. Moral hazard pertains 
not only to health insurance. Explain how moral hazard may operate in 
markets for homeowners ’ insurance (insurance against loss incurred by hom-
eowners on their own home and property) and in automobile liability 
insurance. 

Introduction and Overview 
 33
 1.2  
 Define adverse selection. Give three examples of adverse selection in markets 
other than for health insurance and explain the rationale for each choice. 
 1.3  
 How might adverse selection arise in the market for used cars? What is likely 
to be the effect of adverse selection in the used car market if it were to arise? 
 1.4  
 How do professional norms apply to your life as a student? 
 1.5  
 Explain the distinction between economic efficiency and equity. Is there 
always a trade-off between efficiency and equity as economists use these 
terms? Give examples of instances of (1) a trade-off and (2) no trade-off 
between efficiency and equity. What is a pure externality? 
 1.6  
 Compare treatments for infective and chronic diseases and explain which one 
is more likely to create health externalities to society and which one is more 
likely to impose financial externalities to society. Is there any different impli-
cation for government intervention to control for infective and chronic dis-
eases from the viewpoint of externalities? 
 1.7  
 Explain the term  “ asymmetric information ” between physicians and 
their patients. Please give two examples of how physicians could use the 
advan tage of asymmetric information to earn more profits or raise the price 
of their services.

 Using hospital care as an example, explain the distinction between technical 
efficiency and allocative efficiency. 
 Exercises 
 1.1   Suppose the government in a middle-income country announced its policy 
goal to implement a universal health insurance program within five years. Would 
implementation of this policy increase the demand for health economics research 
in this country? List at least three factors to justify your answer no matter whether 
your answer is  “ yes, ”  “ no, ”  or  “ maybe. ” 
 1.2   Health economics has enjoyed several decades of remarkable growth, but will 
this growth continue? Using your country as an example, list at least three reasons 
to support your answer.

 Health and Health Behaviors 
 Being in good health is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for living a pro-
ductive and long life. Productivity applies to both work and nonwork activities. 
Although much of health economics is about supply and demand for personal 
health care services, the use of health services is derived from the fundamental 
objective of health promotion. Health services and health behaviors are conceptual-
ized as inputs in the production function, with health being the output. 
 Even though health is undoubtedly important to people, we all care about 
more than just being in good health. We value other possessions, such as our 
houses, cars, cell phones, companionship, and feelings of self-worth. The con-
sumption of some goods, such as tobacco products, yields current pleasure but is 
likely to have adverse health effects later in life. Thus, such consumption is a 
 “ good ”  for the individual while the individual is consuming it but can be a  “ bad ” 
in the long run. The consumption of some personal health services is unpleasant 
in the short run — going to the physician or dentist involves both time and often 
inconvenience — and the receipt of some services can be unpleasant and even 
painful, but there may be benefits in the long run. 
 Thus, for example, in deciding whether or not to undergo a medical screening 
procedure such as mammography (a procedure to detect breast cancer) or a 
colonoscopy (a procedure to detect colon cancer), a person is concerned not only 
about promoting current health but about future health as well. Maintaining 
a normal weight may make one more attractive currently as well as more physi-
cally fit, but maintaining normal weight today may also prevent the development 
of diabetes later in life. Thus, eating a slice of apple pie today may yield utility 
for several reasons in the current period, but the decision will also depend, to a 

40 
 Part I / Chapter 2
lesser or greater degree, on the implications of eating the pie today for one ’ s future 
health. 
 In economics, decisions made by individuals or households are analyzed as 
if a decision maker were maximizing his or her utility subject to constraints that 
limit how much utility can be achieved. On any given day, an individual may 
realize benefits in terms of being healthy at the time, engaging in some  “ unhealthy ” 
activities, such as smoking and excess alcohol consumption or eating a slice of 
apple pie with ice cream (rather than just an apple a day, which may indeed yield 
future health benefits), and living in an attractive and comfortable dwelling. Such 
consumption is limited by family income, prices paid by family members for goods 
and services consumed, the time available for market work and other activities, 
and other factors. The utility household members derive from consumption reflects 
individual wants or preferences. 
 This chapter begins with conceptual discussions of rationality and forward-
looking behavior, health production functions, the demand for health services, and 
health behaviors as derived demands. We then describe decision trees and the 
process of backward induction and apply the concepts to the decision about 
whether or not to engage in preventive care. These tools are useful for analyzing 
any problem in which the outcomes of decisions are uncertain. Future outcomes 
are unknown when these choices are made. Next we discuss a general framework 
used in many economic studies about consumer choices in relation to specific 
health behaviors, followed by a discussion of empirical findings on several con-
sumer choices — food consumption and physical exercise, cigarette and alcohol 
consumption, and the use of preventive care. 
 The traditional economic framework commonly used in microeconomics to 
assess impacts on household decisions of various changes that are outside the 
control of households has been challenged by a new economic subfield,  behavioral 
economics . We discuss the behavioral economics critique of traditional  “ neoclas-
sical ” economics and empirical evidence the critics cite to advance their argu-
ments. The critique raises several fundamental questions, such as, Are people 
forward-looking or myopic? Are choices people make rational or irrational (i.e., 
influenced by cues, such as seeing someone else enjoying a cigarette)? And on 
discounting, do short-term discount rates differ from long-run rates? Some argue 
that short-term rates are higher than long-term rates. A higher rate means that one 
is more present-oriented than if the discount rate is comparatively low. The final 
section summarizes the chapter ’ s key points. 
 2.1 
 Rationality and Other Economic Assumptions 
 A major feature of health and health care is that the decisions one makes today affect 
health not only currently but in the future as well (  box 2.1 ). Economics generally 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 41
assumes that people are rational and forward-looking. By  “ rational, ”  economists 
mean that in weighing choices, individuals use all relevant information available to 
them and weigh the benefits and costs of specific choices based on this information. 
Rationality does not require that a person be omniscient, able to accurately predict 
the outcomes of each choice. Various events are likely to occur subsequently that 
may have important effects on outcomes. For example, the decision whether or not 
to attend college is largely made several years in advance, particularly since it is 
necessary to take college preparatory courses. The decision to attend college typi-
cally reflects comparisons for future earnings, nonpecuniary (nonmonetary) returns, 
the cost of attending college, and other factors. However, after the decision is made, 
ill health, war, or unemployment of a parent may affect whether or not the planned 
decision is actually realized. Rationality does not require that the individual be able 
to forecast all events that may intervene. In fact, these events are uncertain; for 
example, actual entry into college will depend on actual realizations of these events.  
 Box 2.1 
 Long-Run Effects of Current Health Decisions: Child Health and Adult Outcomes 
 Decisions one makes about one ’ s own health today have important effects on out-
comes decades later. There is some statistical evidence that nutrition in utero affects 
one ’ s health as an adult ( Barker 1997 ). Some of this research is based on animal 
studies, for which it is possible to deprive the fetus of food and observe subsequent 
outcomes, such as mortality. In other work, people in Holland exposed to famine 
conditions prenatally during World War II in 1944 – 1945 were compared with people 
born a year earlier and a year later in terms of their glucose tolerance as adults (glucose 
intolerance leads to an increased risk of diabetes). The authors found that food depri-
vation of the fetus was linked to higher adult glucose intolerance ( Ravelli, van der 
Meulen, Michels, et al. 1998 ). 
 Smith (2009)  tested whether child health affects various nonhealth outcomes in 
adults, including educational attainment, family income and wealth, and individuals ’ 
earnings and labor supply. To establish a causal link between child health and adult 
outcomes, it is necessary to control for other factors that affect adult outcomes and 
are correlated with child health. Many factors could be measured from the data, but 
the author could not be sure that all relevant factors could be measured. Thus, he 
compared adult outcomes of siblings from the same household who had different 
levels of child health. These comparisons allowed him to account for unmeasured 
family and neighborhood background effects that, if not accounted for, may have led 
to biased estimates of the effect of child health on adult outcomes. Smith found that, 
except for educational attainment, poor child health has a large effect on adult out-
comes. Some of the financial impact of poor childhood health is reduced financial 
resources in the early adulthood. Another part of the financial impact is due to a 
decreased adult labor supply, which in turn reduces individual earnings and family 
income. 

42 
 Part I / Chapter 2
 By  “ forward-looking, ” economists mean that individuals consider not only 
the present costs and benefits of choices but future ones as well. For example, in 
deciding whether or not to have a knee replacement, the individual will consider 
current benefits, such as a reduction in pain and improved mobility, and also future 
ones, such as the length of time to re-replacement. Artificial joints, like natural 
joints, depreciate over time. 
 Economists assume that from today ’ s vantage point, a dollar of benefit or 
cost today is worth more than a dollar of benefit accrued or spent tomorrow. 
The trade-off between today and tomorrow reflects an individual ’ s time preference. 
Let  r be the rate of the individual ’ s time preference. Then a dollar received tomor-
row is worth only $1/(1 +  r ) today (1  >  r  ≥ 0). A person may be forward-looking 
but impatient. Then he or she has a high  r , and conversely for a more patient 
person. 
 Although decisions one makes about one ’ s health today have implications for 
one ’ s health tomorrow, another major distinguishing feature of health and health 
care is that decisions are often if not typically made under uncertainty. People eat 
delicious deserts, consume alcohol, smoke cigarettes, go to a physician for an 
annual physical examination, and follow a physician ’ s advice, all without knowing 
how these choices will actually affect personal health and well-being. The vast 
majority of people who smoke cigarettes do not get lung cancer or have a heart 
attack. Smoking only increases the probability of experiencing these adverse health 
outcomes. It is possible to know averages, but there is substantial variation about 
the averages for several reasons, including genetic and environmental factors and 
interactions among the various health behaviors. As an example of an interaction, 
not only does smoking make it more difficult to jog, but the mean probability of 
getting lung cancer possibly differs between jogging and nonjogging smokers in 
ways that are not even fully understood by medical experts. 
 Economists ’ assumptions may seem implausible, and admittedly they 
often are. In the context of health and health care, an objection to the rationality 
assumption is that if people use the best information they have, this may not be 
good enough. After all, one reason for visiting a physician is to obtain information 
about the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. There is asymmetric 
information between the physician and the patient. If the physician acts in the 
patient ’ s best interest — that is, in economic terminology, if the physician is a perfect 
agent for the principal, in this case the patient — the well-informed physician-
patient team can make a decision as a fully informed patient would. However, if 
the physician has interests of his or her own, the rationality assumption may 
not hold. 
 Economists typically defend their assumptions in the following way. Assump-
tions are made to make economic models more tractable and to yield predictions 
which then can be tested empirically. The assumptions are a building block, a 
means to an end, not an end in itself. However, in recent years, even economists 

Health and Health Behaviors

have begun to challenge their traditional assumptions, and a new field, behavioral 
economics, is gaining in popularity. We will have more to say about behavioral 
economics below. 
 2.2 
 Health Production Functions 
 The Concept 
 A production function relates inputs to outputs. It is a technical relationship, for 
example, describing the relationship between the dose of drug administered to a 
patient and the resulting health outcome. Production functions are used in eco-
nomic analysis, but estimating relationships between inputs and outputs is largely 
the task of scientists, engineers, and other analysts, although economists also esti-
mate production functions. 
 A production function is expressed as: 
 Output ij = f i  (Input1 ij , Input2 ij ; Z ij ) 
(2.1) 
 In equation 2.1,  Output ij is the quantity of output  i produced in a given period 
by the  j th individual, and  Input1 i and  Input2 i are two input quantities used by 
person  j to produce output  Output ij . The function  f reflects a specific technology 
translating inputs into outputs. In a health context, we can take as an example a 
person who has been diagnosed with high blood pressure (hypertension).  Input1 ij 
is the number of meals person  j eats in a time period, say a year, during which the 
person adheres to a salt-free diet, and  Input2 ij is the number of days during the 
year in which  j takes antihypertensive medication. The variable  Z j represents indi-
vidual  j ’ s genetic makeup, which does not vary over time. The semicolon in front 
of this term indicates that  Z j is exogenous to the decision maker, that is, outside 
the decision maker ’ s control. By contrast, the  input s are decision variables assumed 
to be endogenous — within the decision maker ’ s control. The  Output ij could be the 
number of days during the year on which the person has a blood pressure reading 
within the generally accepted normal range. 
 Output ij ,  Input1 ij , and  Input2 ij represent flows — rates of output per unit of 
time, such as days during the year on which the person has a normal blood pres-
sure reading, number of days on which person  j takes medication for hypertension, 
and so on. Blood pressure is a concern not because it is that important in its own 
right but rather because persons with uncontrolled blood pressure are subject to a 
higher probability of acquiring specific chronic diseases, such as heart attacks and 
heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, or death. Therefore, for example, in a more 
complex model,  Output ij for person  j in various years may be inputs and the pres-
ence of heart disease or mortality may be outputs.

 Part I / Chapter 2
 Health Stocks and Flows 
 There is an important distinction between  stocks and  flows . A stock represents a 
quantity at a specific point in time. A flow represents a rate between two time 
periods. For example, on January 1 of a year, households have a specific amount 
of wealth, which is a stock. This stock generates a flow of income per day, month, 
or year. The numbers of cars a manufacturer has in its inventory is a stock, but the 
number of cars produced per hour is a flow. Likewise, a family possesses a certain 
number of automobiles on a date, a stock. This stock generates a specific amount 
of transportation services per day, month, or year. 
 In this sense, personal health on a given day represents a stock of capital. 
The corresponding flow is a healthy day or a day during which a person can 
perform his or her usual activities. The number of days in a month one has high 
blood pressure is a flow, as is the number of days in a month a person jogs. 
However, we know that consistently high blood pressure and many days of inactiv-
ity can adversely affect heart health, which is a stock. 
 2.3 
 The Demand for Health: Health as a Capital 
Stock 
 Evolution of a Person ’ s Health over Time 
 As first conceptualized by Michael  Grossman (1972) , a person ’ s general state of 
health corresponds to the person ’ s health capital.  1 The stock of health capital yields 
a flow of healthy days per unit of time.  2 Since we consider health in the aggregate 
rather than a particular aspect of health, we drop subscript  i , and for simplicity, 
we also suppress subscript  j , although we continue to describe the health of one 
individual. However, since the individual ’ s health varies over time, we include a 
subscript for  t , which may be a year or a shorter or longer time period. 
 The relationship between a person ’ s health stock ( H T ) and his or her health 
flow( h t ) per unit of time  t is given by 
 h t =  f ( H t ). 
(2.2) 
 The relationship between  h t and  H t is positive. A higher health stock in period 
 t yields a higher flow of healthy days. 
 Healthy days and other goods and services are valued by consumers. The 
number of healthy days and the consumption of other goods and services are 
linked. If the person loses time from work because of an illness, earnings fall. And 
since there is no savings in Grossman ’ s model, when family income falls, so does 
the consumption of other goods and services. People invest in their own health by 
utilizing personal health care services. Although other health inputs, including

Health and Health Behaviors

health behaviors, such as smoking and exercising, also affect  H t , to keep the analy-
sis tractable, we ignore this complication for now. Health services use is a flow; in 
Grossman ’ s framework, the use of health services represents a gross health invest-
ment by an individual. Gross investment is distinguished from net investment in 
that the latter incorporates depreciation of the health stock occurring during a 
period  t . Net investment is gross investment less depreciation. In this context, a 
person ’ s health deteriorates or depreciates each period at a depreciation rate of  δ , 
just as any item of plant or equipment depreciates. Knees wear out just as car 
engines do (  box 2.2 ).  
 The depreciation rate is assumed to be fixed at some value that is outside the 
decision maker ’ s control, that is, it is exogenous to the decision maker. The depre-
ciation rate not only varies among individuals but for a given individual varies 
over time; for now, consider only one individual (suppressing the subscript  j ) and 
let the depreciation rate be time invariant. The depreciation rate parameter  δ is not 
 Box 2.2 
 Humans Depreciate, Too! 
 Physical capital includes a plant, durable equipment, and endowments of resources, 
such as mineral deposits and arable land. Intangible capital includes intellectual 
property. Human capital consists of skills and knowledge from schooling, on-the-job 
training, and self-improvement. Health capital consists of cognitive function, physical 
function, and mental or emotional health. 
 It seems straightforward that machines depreciate. Intellectual property depreci-
ates since ideas and inventions become old and are replaced by newer ones. Cognitive 
skills depreciate. There is a distinction between fluid intelligence, measured by pro-
cessing speed on tasks, and crystallized intelligence, measured, for example, by one ’ s 
vocabulary. Fluid intelligence rises initially after birth, peaks at about age 14, and 
declines subsequently. Crystallized intelligence continues to rise throughout adult-
hood but at a decreasing rate until about age 65, when health shocks, such as strokes 
and the onset of dementia, begin to take their toll. Increased mental exercise improves 
crystallized intelligence and leads to a lower subsequent decline. Physical function 
peaks in early adulthood and declines at an increasing rate with age. For example, 
accumulation of plaque in blood vessels often begins in early adulthood. Chest pain, 
heart attacks, and strokes tend to occur much later in life (see  McFadden 2009  for a 
discussion of these points). Mortality rates increase with age. In 2007 in the United 
States, the probability at age 20 of dying within a year was 0.0013 for males and 
0.0005 for females. The probability at age 50 was 0.0055 for males, 0.0034 for females; 
at 65, 0.0167 for males, 0.0107 for females; and at age 85, 0.1059 for males, 0.0785 
for females (see  Social Security Online 2007 ). Clearly, the depreciation rate, as mea-
sured by mortality, increases markedly with age. However, for some aspects of human 
capital, the relationship between age and the depreciation rate is not monotonic, 
particularly at earlier ages.

affected by the person ’ s health care decisions. Let the person ’ s rate of gross invest-
ment in health be  I t , where  t is a time period, such as a year. The individual ’ s health 
stock evolves over time according to 
 H t =  I t  – 1 + (1  –  δ ) H t  – 1 . 
(2.3) 
 Equation 2.3 states that a person ’ s health at time  t equals the amount the 
person invested in health in time  t –  1 plus that part of the previous period ’ s health 
stock that did not depreciate between periods  t  – 1 and  t . The function g( ∙ ) for gross 
investment is 
 I t  – 1 =  g ( m t   – 1 ,  T H   t  – 1 ), 
(2.4) 
 where  m t  – 1 represents the amount of medical care utilized in a period (here in 
 t  – 1) and  T H is the amount of time the person spends obtaining medical care. This 
includes the time spent getting to the doctor, waiting for the doctor, and following 
the regimen prescribed by the doctor, such as taking prescribed medicines. 
 Gross investment,  I t , can never be negative, but  H t is larger or smaller than 
 H t  – 1 , depending on the amount of gross investment in period  t  – 1 and the depre-
ciation rate. Low gross investment or a high depreciation rate can lead to a decline 
in health. 
 Demand for Health and for Medical Care 
 The health production function (equations 2.1 and 2.2) depicts a technical relation-
ship between health, the output, and medical services and health behaviors, the 
inputs. A production function does not describe decisions, only the technical pos-
sibility of translating inputs into outputs. Demand for medical care is derived from 
the person ’ s demand for health. 
 In the general literature on investment, the optimal capital stock is the amount 
at which the cost of capital equals the marginal efficiency of capital (MEC) (  fig. 
2.1 ). The MEC reflects the percentage increase in output made possible by adding 
another unit of capital, all expressed as value (dollar) terms. To help understand 
the concept of MEC, suppose an investment of $100 yields additional output valued 
at $3 per year. Then the MEC would be the increase in the value of annual output 
per $100 of investment, or 0.03. The MEC schedule has a negative slope since the 
decision maker is assumed to rank its potential investments from highest to lowest 
in terms of their expected return (per dollar of investment). The cost of capital 
represents the amount per time period, such as a year, investors require to supply 
$100 of capital funds to the borrower. The borrower will not want to pay more than 
3 percent per period for funds that yield 3 percent. Thus, the equilibrium capital 
stock the firm will want to hold is at the level of capital at which the rate of return 
or MEC equals the cost of capital. In   figure 2.1 , the capital stock is on the  x -axis 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 47
and the cost of capital and the MEC are on the  y -axis. Investment moves the capital 
stock to the right along the  x -axis. The ultimate decision is about how much capital 
to hold. Investment is the way of achieving this end. 
 When an asset depreciates or appreciates over time, the cost of capital equals 
the  sum of (1) the cost of obtaining a dollar of capital for a period, say a year, at a 
rate  i , (2) the depreciation rate on the capital stock at  δ , and (3) the appreciation 
rate of a unit of capital at  a . A dollar of capital can come from borrowing (issuing 
debt) from issuing stock in one ’ s company, or from internal funds. Roughly speak-
ing, the cost of debt capital is the interest rate; the cost of issuing equity depends 
on dividends to be paid and the cost of diluting ownership and control in the 
company when issuing stock; and the opportunity cost is the cost of internal funds 
when the investment is financed by internal funds. All of these costs are in  i . 
Depreciation is also the cost of holding an investment good for a period. For 
example, if one operates a rental car business, the cost of capital is higher if the 
rate of depreciation on cars in the fleet is higher, holding other factors constant. 
Finally, the appreciation rate on the investment good is an offsetting factor. For 
example, a car may depreciate but, if car prices are rising, the latter is an offset to 
the former.  
 Before turning to health and medical care, it is useful to discuss an example 
from another context to illustrate the general principle. Suppose you owned a car

rental business. The decision is how many cars to own for rental purposes. You 
can borrow funds at a 5 percent interest rate, the cars depreciate at a rate of 25 
percent per year, and the general annual rate of inflation in car prices is 3 percent. 
Then the cost of capital is 27 percent. You stop adding to your fleet of cars at the 
point at which the rate of return on rental cars declines to 27 percent. Once you 
decide how many cars you wish to own, you buy or sell cars to achieve the optimal 
number of cars in your fleet. 
 The rate of return on cars reflects the revenue obtained from each car for the 
year, expenses on maintenance and upkeep, and labor and other costs of renting 
out the cars. If the rental price increases, the rate of return increases. If the wage 
of your mechanics increases, the rate of return decreases. If crime in the neighbor-
hood increases, necessitating hiring more guards for the company ’ s parking lot, the 
rate of return decreases. One reason that the MEC curve is downward sloping is 
that the demand curve for rental cars facing the firm is downward sloping. Perhaps 
there are diseconomies of scale in car rentals as well, especially at a single 
location. 
 The cost of capital as applied to health decisions is both similar to and dif-
ferent from the cost as it applies to a company ’ s investment decisions. Clearly, an 
individual does not issue stock for the purpose of making investments in his or 
her personal health. However, the person may draw on personal savings or borrow 
money from a bank to finance a stay in the hospital. Health capital depreciates. 
Knees can become arthritic. Replacements for natural knees also depreciate over 
time, and eventually may be replaced. Likewise, there is appreciation in medical 
prices. If the price of a knee replacement is expected to double, a person who would 
benefit from having this procedure may decide to obtain it sooner. In a health 
context, you as an investor can only buy, not sell, health assets. Capital stock is 
reduced through depreciation, which occurs over time. 
 The cost-of-capital schedule may be horizontal or positively sloped. If the 
latter, this means that the cost of capital rises with the amount of capital goods 
purchased. For simplicity, we draw the cost of capital with a zero slope. 
 The MEC of health depends on how a unit of investment affects the health 
stock, the variable cost of maintaining the stock (analogously, painting a house 
periodically to keep up its appearance), the productivity of investments in health 
capital, and the value the individual attaches to a one-unit change in health. Value 
depends on the individual ’ s preferences. People differ in how much they value 
health, just as they differ in how much they value housing, transportation, and 
other goods and services. There are likely to be important differences in the pro-
ductivity of health investments among individuals as well. For example, people 
may differ in their understanding of the physician ’ s advice for postoperative care. 
 The MEC (for marginal efficiency of investment a concept from macroeco-
nomics and the theory of investment in particular) is the rate of return on a unit 
of capital. In evaluating capital projects, one expects a decision maker to rank order 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 49
projects in terms of their (prospective) rates of return — from highest to lowest rates 
of return. Thus, the MEC schedule has a negative slope. 
 The optimal capital stock for the company, or in our context the optimal 
amount of health capital an individual desires to hold in a specific time period, is 
determined by where the cost of capital and the MEC are equal. Intuitively, if the 
cost of capital is 5 percent and the MEC is 8 percent, the company can increase its 
profits if it adds to its capital stock, and conversely if the MEC is only 3 percent. 
Investment, in our context, the consumption of personal health care services, and 
the time associated with such consumption are means toward an end — having the 
optimal amount of health capital. 
 Shifts in the cost of capital and MEC schedules change the optimal capital 
stock for an individual. First let ’ s consider an increase in the cost of capital stem-
ming from an increase in the person ’ s depreciation rate (  fig. 2.2 ). Suppose the 
individual is unexpectedly diagnosed with cancer, or we are comparing an elderly 
individual with a high depreciation rate with a student in her early twenties with 
a low depreciation rate. A high depreciation rate, holding other factors constant, 
implies a lower desired health care stock.  
 Now, consider shifts in the MEC schedule. An increase in input productivity 
(e.g., in the effect of an extra visit to a physician for consultation on personal health) 
raises rates of return and hence shifts the MEC schedule to the right. For example, 
consider the knee replacement. A better device — one that lasts longer or works

better — has a higher rate of return. Thus, the MEC shifts upward for this reason, 
and the health stock and investment, including in artificial knees, rise. Conversely, 
an increase in the price of an input used to produce a unit of capital, such as the 
artificial knee, shifts the MEC schedule to the left (  fig. 2.3 ). Since capital is  “ made ” 
by investment, the amount of investment per period declines as well. Conceptually, 
an increase in the value the individual places on being in good health relative to 
the value he or she places on flows from the other composite good also shifts the 
MEC schedule upward, resulting in more gross investment in health.  
 Another factor shifting the MEC schedule rightward is an increase in the 
returns on investments in health capital. The health flow may become more highly 
valued either because of an increase in utility of a healthy day or, with the caveat 
noted below, because of an increase in the return from market work — the person ’ s 
wage, since more healthy time allows higher earnings to accrue from market work. 
 Predictions of the Grossman Model 
 The Grossman investment model offers several predictions about the effects of 
changes that are exogenous to households on health capital and health investment. 
 A Reduction in the Price of Medical Care

in this market. The price reduction has two effects. It will lead to the substitution 
of medical care for other health inputs, such as self-care or the purchase and use 
of over-the-counter medicines. And it shifts the MEC to the right, which leads the 
person to want to hold more health capital and demand more medical care for this 
reason as well. Thus, the model predicts that a decrease in price leads to the greater 
use of medical care and improved personal health. 
 An Increase in the Individual ’ s Wage Rate 
 An increase in the person ’ s wage has two effects on medical care use and health 
capital. The higher wage increases the opportunity cost of time, in this sense 
making it more expensive to visit a physician. For this reason, an increase in wage 
affects health investment and health capital in the same way as an increase in the 
price of medical care does. But in addition, an increase in wage raises the return 
on a healthy day since the individual can earn more in a day when she is able to 
work. The latter effect tends to increase demand for health capital and health 
investment. Thus, a change in the individual ’ s wage rate has an ambiguous effect 
on a person ’ s medical care use and health capital. 
 An Increase in the Individual ’ s Age 
 Now consider the effects of a person ’ s age on medical care use and health (  box 2.3 ). 
In the Grossman model, the rate of depreciation ( δ ) of the health stock increases 
with age. This is a plausible assumption. For example, agility decreases with age 
at a higher rate than at lower ages. An increase in  δ reduces the amount of health 
capital the individual desires to  “ hold, ”  which, other factors held constant, reduces 
demand for medical care. But an increase in  δ also decreases  H directly (see equa-
tion 2.2). Thus, even though the desired health stock is lower, absent some increased 
investment,  H may be below its optimal level. This leads to increased demand for 
medical care. Although the individual ’ s optimal  H decreases with age, older persons 
use more medical care, a pattern observed in empirical studies. Death occurs in 
the Grossman model when the individual ’ s health stock declines below a minimum 
level,  H d , say below  H 2 in   figure 2.2 .  
 An Increase in the Individual ’ s Educational Attainment 
 On average, persons who have completed more years of schooling are in better 
health (  box 2.4 ). By contrast, the pattern of medical care use by educational attain-
ment is less clear.  Grossman (1972)  argued that education increases the productivity 
of investments in health. A more educated person is more likely to be sensitive to 
signs and symptoms of illness and to visit a doctor sooner in cases for which medical 
care is likely to be productive. If treatment is initiated earlier, it may be more pro-
ductive in improving health. Also, more highly educated individuals may be better 
in understanding the physician ’ s diagnosis and recommended treatments. For these 
reasons, we would expect the MEC schedule to shift to the right when the person

 Relationship between Health Care Expenditure Per Person and Age 
 Spending on personal health care services increases with age in all countries for 
which we have the information. Data on health care spending by age for 1992 and 
2000 in France provide an example (  fig. 2.4 ). Mean individual health care expendi-
tures per person increased with age in both years, but more so in 2000 than in 1992. 
The increase with age is explained by the Grossman model. The change in the rate 
of increase with age between 1992 and 2000 is not.  
 In France, there was little change in the relationship between age and health care 
spending for physicians ’ services between the two years. However, spending on 
pharmaceuticals and on hospitals rose much more markedly with age in 2000 than 
in 1992.  Dormont, Grignon, and Huber (2006)  attribute most of the change in the 
age-health spending relationship to the technological advances that occurred in the 
intervening years. For example, persons with a heart attack were more likely to 
undergo complex cardiac procedures in 2000 than in 1992.

 Effects of Educational Attainment on Adult Health 
 In the Grossman model, education improves individuals ’ efficiency in producing 
health. This means that persons with higher educational attainment are better at 
evaluating their health and seeking medical attention when it is appropriate to do so. 
They may also be better in understanding the physician ’ s advice and instructions. By 
being more efficient in health production, they demand higher levels of health. Thus, 
the model offers an explicit prediction that higher educational attainment causes 
higher levels of health stock, and the model is ambiguous about whether or not health 
care utilization is higher or lower. 
 Economists have been very interested in ascertaining empirically whether higher 
educational attainment leads to better health in adulthood. While the question is 
easily understood, demonstrating a causal effect empirically is actually quite difficult. 
Several problems must be overcome. First, the causal relationship can run both ways, 
from education to health and from health to education. More specifically, healthier 
youths may be more likely to stay in school. Thus, unless the researcher accounts for 
child, adolescent, and young adult health, as well as educational attainment, the 
measured effect of education on adult health may be overstated. Second, educational 
attainment may be correlated with other factors that affect both educational attain-
ment and health, and it is important to account for these other factors in empirical 
analysis. For example, persons who are more patient, that is, have lower rates of time 
preference (see this chapter ’ s discussion of discounting), may demand both more 
education and more health. Persons who are more motivated to pursue a professional 
career and want to become business executives or high-level government officials 
may decide to stay in school longer and be more careful about their health. Having 
more highly educated parents may be helpful for completing one ’ s homework, but 
such parents, being more efficient in health production, may also help their children 
learn good health habits. 
 Finding data on all of these possible correlates of educational attainment is indeed 
an arduous task. One way around this set of problems is to find variables causing 
changes in educational attainment that are not correlated with these other factors that 
may have independent effects on adult health. For example,  Albuoy and Lequien 
(2009),  using longitudinal data (data that follow individuals over time) from France, 
focused on two reforms, which raised minimum school attendance to age 14 and then 
from 14 to age 16. Changes in mandatory schooling attendance laws are plausibly 
unrelated to the personal and family characteristics possibly affecting adult health 
described above but are likely to have increased the mean number of years of school-
ing completed. The authors found empirical evidence that these reforms increased 
education levels, but although subsequent declines in mortality were observed, none 
of the declines were statistically significant. Thus, on the basis of this study ’ s findings 
alone, one cannot properly conclude that education improves health. The article 
includes a comprehensive literature review; many previous studies did not show a

has completed more years of schooling. More highly educated persons should be 
healthier for this reason, but the effect of education on medical care use is less clear 
since health inputs may be more productive for more highly educated persons. 
Hence, less medical care is needed to produce a given level of health. Education also 
affects the wage rate, but Grossman accounted for the wage effect separately.  
 2.4 
 Measuring Health Capital 
 Ideally, there would be a single metric of health capital, such as the market value 
of a building for physical capital, and measurement could be performed by simply 
placing one ’ s finger on a button, and the  “ health capital meter ” would provide a 
numerical value of the person ’ s health stock. Unlike physical capital, there is no 
accepted unitary measure of health capital. Moreover, there is no market price for 
good health, although health definitely has value. It is just hard to measure. 
Although difficult, in recent years there have been many attempts at quantification 
of the value of changes in health. There is no single commonly accepted measure 
of health status, but there are several widely used proxies. 
 Mortality 
 The most objective single health status measure is mortality. In the Grossman 
model, death occurs when health capital falls below a certain threshold. An 
advantage of mortality as a measure of health capital is that there is no interrater 
variability in mortality as there is in assessing other dimensions of health, cer-
tainly psychological states but even physiological dimensions. For example, on a 
causal effect. Failure to find a relationship does not mean that Grossman ’ s framework 
is wrong. Rather, it means that some rigorous empirical tests do not lend support to 
his hypothesis. 
 By using a cohort data set of education reform in Taiwan, another similar study 
found evidence that there is a causal relationship between parental education and 
child health ( Chou, Liu, Grossman, et al. 2010 ). In 1968, Taiwan extended the com-
pulsory education system from six years (primary school) to nine years (junior 
high school). Chou and her colleagues found that this reform led to a significant 
increase in years of schooling for individuals born after 1956, which in turn lowered 
the incidence of low birth weight and mortality of infants born in the period 1978 –
 1999. This result suggests that an increase in parents ’ schooling causes better infant 
health.

disability scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is totally disabled, one rater may rate inability 
to climb three flights of stairs as a 6. Another person may consider this a 9. Patients 
are often asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10. There is interpersonal 
variability in rating the same level of pain as well. 
 Mortality-based measures include life expectancy, measured at birth or later 
in the life course. Life expectancy measures median years of survival of the persons 
in a given cohort. The median is calculated at the 50th percentile of personal 
longevity. 
 Although mortality-based measures may be adequate for countries with low 
life expectancies, in countries in which longevity has increased markedly, so has 
the burden of chronic disease. Thus, researchers have characterized health in terms 
of measures that reflect the quantity as well as the quality of life. Grossman mea-
sured the flow from the stock of health as the number of healthy days in a year 
minus the number of days during which the person was ill or the number of days 
the person spent in bed. However, people often experience health losses that do 
not involve being in bed, or even being  “ sick ” in the usual sense of the word. For 
example, some people may have frequent headaches or stiffness in the neck or leg 
and continue to work or attend school. Or they might have a mental condition such 
as being depressed. A depressed person might go to work and conduct household 
activities, but not feel good about it. 
 Quality-of-Life Rating Scales 
 To account for such sources of variation in health, researchers have used two con-
ceptually different approaches. In one approach, used in some disciplines other 
than economics, such as psychology, quality of life is measured by a rating scale. 
A survey respondent is read a description of a case (e.g., about a person with a 
specific disease), and the respondent is asked to rate the case on a scale, for 
example a 10-point scale ranging from 0 for dead to 10 for asymptomatic ( Patrick 
and Erickson 1993 ;  Kaplan 1995 ). The responses are then used as a measure of 
quality of life for a person with this diagnosis or condition. Suppose the mean 
response for a particular ailment (e.g., serious migraine headaches) is 6.7 and 
persons with the ailment have a mean life expectancy of 20 years. The quality-
adjusted life-years interval for persons in this category is 20  × 0.67 or 13.4 years. 
In health care jargon, quality-adjusted life years are called QALYs. By contrast, a 
person with an amputated leg with the same life expectancy might hypothetically 
have 20  × 0.43 = 8.6 QALYs remaining. QALYs do have the virtue of describing 
health in a single metric, and this measure is widely used for this reason. Given 
the complexity of the human body, the health of each of us could conceivably be 
described in each of hundreds of metrics. 
 Economists have been critical of the use of rating scales to measure quality 
of life. In particular, economics focuses on choices people make subject to con-
straints, such as an income constraint. Consuming a good or a service means giving 

56 
 Part I / Chapter 2
up something else. With the rating scale, survey respondents could rate all illnesses 
and conditions as low or high life quality. One ’ s answer to one question has no 
direct bearing on one ’ s answer to another. 
 Quality of Life Derived from Trade-off Questions 
 We are about to introduce this book ’ s first application of decision making under 
uncertainty. Before proceeding, we describe an important concept. Suppose there 
are two alternative outcomes,  X 1 and  X 2. These are two different values of the same 
measure, which are realized at a future date.  X 1 and  X 2 may be prices of a share of 
stock, test scores, or the number of apples that grow on a tree. Let  Θ be the probabil-
ity that the value will be  X 1 and (1  –  Θ ) be the probability that the value will be 
 X 2 . Then the  expected value  of  X is 
 E ( X ) =  Θ X 1 + (1  –  Θ ) X 2 . 
(2.5) 
 The probabilities  Θ  and (1  –  Θ ) weigh the likelihood of each outcome occurring, 
where the weights sum to 1.0. 
 One method for deriving a measure of QALY is to use responses to  standard 
gamble  questions. People are read a description of life with a certain disease. Then 
they are asked the following trade-off question (actually a series of questions, but 
our description describes the underlying concept). Suppose you had this disease 
and there was a surgical operation that would either (1) cure you of the disease 
completely, and you would be in perfect health,  or (2) kill you during the operation 
painlessly and quickly. At what probability of death would you be indifferent 
between having the operation or not? The respondent is asked to assume that the 
operation would be completely covered by health insurance. For this reason, there 
would be no monetary cost to the respondent of undergoing the procedure. In this 
application, being in perfect health is set at a value of 1.0. Being dead is valued at 
0.0. Thus, the maximum probability of death the respondent would accept to 
undergo the operation reveals the decrement to health due to having the disease. 
 To see the standard gamble works, using subscripts to depict states of the 
world, let  U a be the person ’ s utility when perfectly healthy,  U d be the utility when 
dead,  U b be the person ’ s utility with the disease, and  Θ * be the probability of dying 
painlessly and quickly during the operation that makes the person indifferent 
between undergoing the operation or not. Then 
 U b = (1  –  Θ *) U a +  Θ * U d . 
(2.6) 
 Set  U a to 1.0 and  U d to 0.0. If the person answering the standard gamble ques-
tion gives us  Θ *, then we can determine the utility of being in the state with the 
disease  U b . For example, if  Θ * is 0.2, the utility of being in the state with the disease 
is 0.8. Values of  U b can be computed for a variety of disease states or for general 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 57
measures of health capital. In this example, the  Θ * values are weights. Using the 
standard gamble questions, the weights are elicited from survey respondents. The 
weights in this case reveal the relative utilities of being in the alternative health 
states. 
 Responding to a question about having an operation to cure one of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a medical term for chronic bronchitis and 
emphysema, lung diseases often caused by smoking, respondents gave a mean 
value of  Θ * of 0.423 and a median value of 0.325 ( Khwaja, Sloan, and Wang 2009 ), 
implying values of  U b of 0.577 (= 1.0  – 0.423) and 0.675, respectively. The  U b ’ s can 
be interpreted as QALYs. Interestingly, as reported by Khwaja, Sloan, and Wang, 
the mean value of quality of life with COPD obtained from current smokers was 
higher than the mean values obtained from former and never smokers, implying 
that smokers derive less utility loss from getting COPD than nonsmokers do, which 
may be one reason why they smoke.  3 To develop an index for a country as a whole, 
one would need to ask similar questions about a host of diseases and conditions 
and survey persons from across the country. 
 2.5 
 Adding Uncertainty: Decision Trees, Backward 
Induction, and Decision Making under Uncertainty 
 Grossman ’ s model was pathbreaking at the time his paper was published and is 
still considered an outstanding contribution. However, Grossman did not incorpo-
rate uncertainty into his model (see, e.g.,  Gilleskie 2008 ). Most decisions one makes 
about one ’ s health involve a high degree of uncertainty about the effects of deci-
sions. Thus, in analyzing decisions people make about their health and health care, 
it is important to consider uncertainty. But as in general happens, adding realism 
comes at the cost of added complexity. 
 The formal theory used by economists to evaluate decisions under uncer-
tainty was originally developed by John  von Neumann, a mathematician, and Oskar 
Morgenstern, an economist, in the late 1940s (see  von Neumann and Morgenstern 
1944 ). The underlying premise of this framework is that when outcomes from a 
decision are uncertain, people select the alternative that has the highest expected 
utility. We will have much more to say about their concept when we discuss indi-
vidual demand for private health insurance in chapter 4. 
 In the context of our standard gamble example, those persons who believe 
that the actual probability of dying during the operation is less than  Θ * will 
undergo the operation. Those who believe that the actual probability exceeds  Θ * 
will reject the operation and live the rest of their life with their disease (for exam-
ple, COPD). If the probability is less than  Θ *, a person ’ s expected utility is higher 
if she has the operation, and conversely if the probability is greater than  Θ *. The 
3.  An alternative 
interpretation is that 
the smokers knew 
they had a higher 
probability of getting 
COPD and they 
rationalized an 
unpleasant situation 
that they were likely to 
confront by minimizing 
its ad  verse 
consequences.

58 
 Part I / Chapter 2
pro bability  Θ * may be expected to vary among individuals. Those who attach a 
lower utility to being in a state of health with the disease will have a higher  Θ *, 
and conversely. 
 The standard gamble question depicts a problem of decision making under 
uncertainty. People who decide to undergo the procedure to cure their disease do 
not know in advance whether they will actually survive the operation or not. Ex 
ante, the probabilities of dying or being completely cured are between 0 and 1. Ex 
post, or after the operation, the probability of death is either 0 or 1. In other words, 
the effects of inputs on outputs are uncertain. 
 The example of having an operation to cure COPD is completely hypothetical. 
No such operation actually exists. Furthermore, although it is a useful analytic 
device, few persons undergo surgical procedures in which the probability of dying 
during the operation is as high as 0.2 or 0.4. Such a risk would only be undertaken, 
as a general rule, after all possible therapeutic alternatives had been exhausted. 
 A Realistic Application: A Pediatrician ’ s Decision about 
Ordering a Throat Culture 
 There are many realistic applications in which patients and their physicians make 
clinical decisions under conditions of uncertainty. As a case in point, consider 
whether or not a pediatrician should obtain a specimen for culture from children 
who visit the pediatrician ’ s office with sore throats.  4 There are three alternatives: 
give antibiotics to all children with sore throats, test all children for a throat infec-
tion and give antibiotics to all children who test positive, and give antibiotics to 
none of the children with sore throats. 
 To focus on the issue at hand, how people make decisions when the decision 
criterion is an expected value, we assume that the physician always acts in the 
best interest of the patient, and both the physician and the patient (or in this case 
the patient ’ s parent) are rational — that is, they consider the full range of benefits 
and costs in making a decision. 
 Costs in this context are the costs of the culture, of the antibiotics, and of not 
treating a strep throat. An untreated case of streptococcal infection may lead to 
rheumatic heart disease, which may in turn lead to disability, premature death, or 
cardiac surgery to repair a damaged heart valve resulting from rheumatic fever. 
Thus, days with strep throat represent a health flow, and inputs or health invest-
ments are the throat cultures and antibiotics (and implicitly physician time). 
Assume for now that antibiotics always cure strep throat, and there are no errors 
in the throat culture results. 
 The option to be selected is the one with the minimum cost. Cost incorporates 
both the costs of resources expended in diagnosis and treatment  and  the monetary 
equivalent of the utility loss from illness. By casting utility loss as a cost, we do 
not explicitly consider utilities in this application. Rather, utility is present but in 
the background as a factor determining cost. 
4.  This example is 
taken by  Keeler (1995).  
This chapter in a book 
on cost-effectiveness 
and cost-benefit 
analysis pro vides 
several applications of 
decision analysis.

Health and Health Behaviors 
 59
 By convention, in drawing the decision trees used in decision analysis, squares 
represent choice nodes. Circles represent states of nature with associated probabili-
ties of outcomes that are beyond the decision maker ’ s control. Throat cultures and 
antibiotic treatment have associated prices. The cost of an untreated streptococcal 
infection must be computed in terms of the loss in utility from a decrease in health 
capital attributable to rheumatic fever, which reflects both the loss of health capital 
and the utility loss associated with a unit of loss of health capital (  fig. 2.5 ).  
 Now let us consider each of the alternatives. One option is always to treat a 
sore throat ( “ treat, ” top of   fig. 2.5 ). The total cost is the sum of the cost of the anti-
biotic  C a and the cost of antibiotic resistance  C ar (also part of health capital, i.e., it 
makes a negative contribution to health capital), which occurs with a probability 
 Θ ar . The cost of antibiotic resistance depends partly on the availability of alternative 
antibiotics that may be effective against the bacteria causing infection in the future. 
If new antibiotics are anticipated, there is less reason for physicians to be cautious 
about prescribing currently available drugs because of a concern about drug resis-
tance. The decision maker believes that the probability of strep is a certain value  Θ s , 
and the probability the child does not have strep is (1  –  Θ s ). If the child does not 
have strep, the total cost is the cost of the throat culture. (There is no utility loss 
when there is no streptococcal infection.) The expected cost is (1  –  Θ s ) C c when the 
child has no strep versus  Θ s ( C c +  C a ) if the culture reveals the presence of strep. 
 The third option is not to culture or treat with an antibiotic ( “ no treat, ” bottom 
of fig. 2.5). Then the expected cost is  Θ s C rf, , where  C rf  is the cost of having rheumatic

fever, measured in terms of the utility loss from decreased health capital and the 
treatment cost needed to restore health capital to its level prior to the onset of 
rheumatic fever. 
 To select the option with the lowest cost, the decision maker computes 
expected costs by taking into account the probabilities of various outcomes and 
the costs to be incurred in the future. The optimal decision depends on the prob-
abilities  Θ ar and  Θ s , and the costs are  C ar ,  C c ,  C a , and  C rf . Changes in the probabilities 
and costs could dramatically change the optimal decision and hence the demand 
for cultures, antibiotics, and cures for damaged heart valves. If, for example, every 
child with a sore throat had streptococcal infection ( Θ s = 1), there would be no 
reason to test for strep, and similarly, if the probability of strep was nearly zero 
and the costs of untreated strep were low, there would be no need to test for strep. 
 For various reasons, these parameters may differ among countries. If antibiot-
ics are cheap and substitute antibiotics are readily available to handle drug resis-
tance, the demand for throat cultures may fall. 
 The pecuniary value of a unit of health capital may vary among countries and 
among persons within a country (see, e.g.,  Murphy and Topel 2006;   Hall and Jones 
2007 ; chapter 16, this book). The cost of a throat culture may vary because of dif-
ferences in the prices of cultures, whether or not cultures are subsidized by health 
insurance or available at a free clinic, and the distances a parent and child must 
travel to reach a facility at which cultures are administered. 
 Errors in Diagnostic Tests 
 In the above example, the culture results are never wrong. More realistically, tests 
are not perfect. Neither are treatments. For example, drugs and surgery vary in their 
effectiveness. Perhaps at some time in the future, advances in knowledge about 
genetics will make it possible to perfectly match patients and therapeutic approaches 
(e.g., various drugs within a drug class) perfectly, but the state of current knowledge 
falls far short of this ideal. 
 In   table 2.1 , of the 200 persons with no strep (as determined later after the 
initial culture was performed), the culture was positive in 20 percent (40/200) of 
children, suggesting strep, a false positive. On the other hand, of the 100 cases in

which the child actually had strep, the test yielded negative results 10 percent of 
the time, which are false negatives. A false positive result may have led to a treat-
ment that was not warranted and a false negative result may have led to no recom-
mendation for treatment when treatment was warranted. In total, 16.7 percent of 
tests yielded erroneous findings. 
 The existence of false positive and false negative test results may affect the 
optimal testing and treatment strategy. If the initial probability of having the disease 
is high, then a negative culture is likely to be a false negative. To the extent that 
this is so, the optimal strategy may be to administer the antibiotic without the 
culture. Conversely, if the initial probability of having the disease is low, then a 
positive test result is likely to be a false positive, in which case the optimal strategy 
may be to forgo both the test and the treatment, but this will also depend on the 
cost of untreated disease. The probability of disease in   table 2.1  is somewhere in 
the middle, in which case testing and treatment are likely to be the optimal 
strategy.  
 The decision tree and associated probabilities at first glance seem distant from 
the production function given by equation 2.1. But there is a definite relationship 
between the two. Suppose that the input is a physician visit in which sore throats 
are diagnosed and treated, and the output is measured in terms of cures. The mar-
ginal product of the visit will depend on both the accuracy of the culture and the 
effectiveness of the antibiotic in treating streptococcal infection. False negatives 
and false positives will lower the productivity of the visit. Cures in turn will affect 
health according to equation 2.2. 
 2.6 
 Consumer Choices about Health Behaviors: A 
General Framework 
 Unhealthy Behaviors 
 Above, we specified medical care and patient time associated with the receipt of 
medical care as components of health investment. It is a simple matter to add 
patient time allocated to activities that enhance health, such as time spent on 
physical exercise. However, not all time is spent on activities that improve health. 
Not only is time spent on activities that have no effect on health, but people often 
engage in health-reducing behaviors as well. Such activities as smoking, excessive 
alcohol and illicit drug use, driving at high speeds, and skydiving are often if not 
generally bad for one ’ s health. 
 In an economic framework, a person engages in health-decreasing activities 
because the outputs of such activities, such as getting intoxicated, experiencing 
thrills from taking risks, or impressing a member of the opposite gender, yield 
utility in their own right. Thus, for example, a person may smoke for enjoyment 

62 
 Part I / Chapter 2
even though the person knows that smoking is bad for his or her health in the long 
run. These are choices for which there is long-run pain for short-term gain. There 
are also activities with long-term gain for short-term pain, such as jogging, for some 
if not for all of us, or getting a colonoscopy. Getting a colonoscopy involves short-
term inconvenience (taking bad-tasting medication to clear one ’ s intestines the day 
before the procedure, with associated cramps, fasting, and loss of time from other 
activities) and out-of-pocket cost, but in the long run, screening for colon cancer 
may avert serious colon cancer, morbidity, disability, and death. 
 The Concept of Present Value 
 As an example of how initiating a habit harmful to one ’ s health can be viewed in 
an economic framework, we consider the decision to start and stop smoking. 
Smoking is both common and harmful to health. Because the benefits and costs of 
smoking do not all accrue simultaneously (some of the costs occur years after a 
person starts smoking), as a first step, we introduce the concept of present value 
( PV ) of an asset. 
 Suppose one possesses a bond that pays $1 a year for  T years. At the end of 
 T , the lender repays the purchase price of the bond. Then  PV is the following: 
 PV = 1/(1 +  i ) + 1/(1 +  i ) 2 + 1/(1 +  i ) 3 + 1/(1 +  i ) 4 . . . + 1/(1 +  i ) T 
+ purchase price/(1 +  i ) T . 
(2.7) 
 Other factors being the same,  PV is lower for higher values of  i , the discount 
rate, and conversely. With a higher value of  i , returns accruing in the distant future 
receive relatively less weight in present value than do returns accruing earlier. 
Conversely, costs incurred far in the future have less of an influence on  PV when 
 i is high. Many if not most health behaviors involve a trade-off between taking a 
precaution now in return for an improvement in health later. Smoking involves 
lack of precaution now, with adverse health effects, when they occur, often appear-
ing many decades after a person initiates the habit. 
 Fundamental Underlying Assumptions 
 Assumptions: Rational, Forward-Looking, and Time Consistency Described 
 In an economic framework, economists typically assume that people are (1)  ratio-
nal , that is, that they take into account all available information in making deci-
sions; (2)  forward-looking , considering future benefits and costs as well as those 
accruing currently; and (3)  time consistent , that is, they apply the same discount 
rate throughout the time horizon of the decision and over which the consequences 
of the decision are expected to occur. 
 To understand what being rational, forward-looking, and time consistent is 
not, consider the alternatives. An irrational person may be  impulsive , making 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 63
spur-of-the-moment decisions based on cues. Or the person may be  boundedly 
rational , that is, not able to fully evaluate the pros and cons of alternative options 
because the person is limited cognitively. Persons who do not take account of future 
benefits and costs in weighing options are  myopic . 
 Time-inconsistent  individuals apply a higher discount rate  i in the short run 
than they do in longer run. If benefits from the decision are realized first, such as 
enjoying a cigarette after a good meal, followed in time by costs, such as adverse 
health effects from being a smoker, a higher discount rate would tend to make 
future costs less important when discounted to the present. Since the discount 
rate for the decision of whether or not to smoke today is high relative to the dis-
count rate between tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and between the day 
after tomorrow and the day after that, the time-inconsistent individual reasons, 
 “ I ’ ll stop smoking tomorrow. ” (Tomorrow, the discount rate will be lower than 
today.) Thus, the future costs of smoking will loom larger in the decision whether 
or not to smoke tomorrow than it does in the decision about whether to smoke 
today. Similarly, a time-inconsistent individual would eat the apple pie with ice 
cream for dessert today, reasoning that he will start dieting tomorrow. Today, the 
benefit of dieting, the benefit of a trim waistline, is discounted at a high rate and 
hence not worth as much as when the decision is made tomorrow. Of course, 
tomorrow never comes. When offered apple pie tomorrow, the decision is like 
today ’ s. A time-inconsistent individual might well be attracted by a furniture store ’ s 
advertisement that buyers can buy furniture now, with payments to begin only 
next year. 
 In deciding whether or not to order a desert at a restaurant, a patron may 
reason that he will start dieting tomorrow to justify ordering the desert today. Like 
a rational economic agent, the patron is forward-looking in contemplating the 
downstream consequences of a current action. Following this reasoning, the patron 
knows he will enjoy the desert now and the consequences of the desert, weight 
gain and possible deleterious effects on health and appearance, will occur later. 
In deciding whether or not to consume the desert today, the person implicitly 
compares the benefit, the enjoyment of eating the desert now with the conse-
quence, not being able to fit into his clothes tomorrow. In thinking about dieting 
tomorrow, the person thinks that the comparison tomorrow will involve a benefit 
from the desert to be derived if the desert is consumed tomorrow versus a cost, 
which is not being able to fit in one ’ s clothes the day after tomorrow. Of course, if 
the person eats the desert on both evenings, it is possible that the clothes purchased 
tomorrow will not fit the next day, necessitating another purchase of even larger 
clothes. 
 More formally, on evening 0, the individual derives a benefit from the desert 
of  B 0. This benefit is compared with a cost of  C 1 /(1 +  i 0 ). Cost has a subscript of 1 
since the weight gain becomes apparent only tomorrow. If the former exceeds the 
later, he consumes the desert. On the second evening, the comparison is between 

64 
 Part I / Chapter 2
the benefit, still  B 0 , and the cost, still  C , but the  C is now divided by (1 +  i 1 ), where 
 i 1  <  i 0 . In other words, in the longer run, the patron is less present-oriented than 
in the short run. The problem is that the long run never arrives because although 
the patron knows better, he lacks self-control. These are called time-inconsistent 
preferences in that the discount rate between the first and the second day is not 
the same as between the second and the third day, or between the third and the 
fourth day, and so on. 
 To deal with lack of self-control, forward-looking agents may employ precom-
mitment devices. For example, one may forgo going to the restaurant altogether to 
avoid being tempted to order a caloric desert. Or when shopping, a person may 
not buy ice cream in the grocery store because he knows if it is available at home 
in the refrigerator, he will eat it as a midnight snack. The same goes for cigarettes 
or liquor in the home. For very obese persons, bariatric surgery, which reduces the 
effective size of the stomach, may be an effective self-control device. 
 Ex Ante Expectations and Decisions, Ex Post Realizations, and 
Revising Expectations from Learning 
 Analytically, a person makes a decision by working backward, starting at the end 
of the person ’ s time horizon and working backward to the decision point. The 
economic term for this thought process is  backward induction . People are assumed 
to make as sound a decision as possible given events that have already 
transpired. 
 Suppose there are  T time periods. Then in this model of backward induction, 
a person considers what the optimal decision is in period  T . The logic is then 
repeated for one period earlier,  T  – 1. The net result is an efficient string of choices 
leading back to the initial period, period 0. In period 0, the person makes decisions 
based on what he or she expects the future to hold. Over time, what was once a 
prediction becomes a reality — an outcome is either realized or it is not, and indi-
viduals may make midcourse corrections to accommodate new information that 
accumulates over time. 
 For example, to illustrate the difference between ex ante and ex post, the 
learning process, and midcourse corrections that result from learning, suppose a 
family is planning a picnic and chooses among three alternative days on which to 
have the picnic. On day 0, the family makes subjective judgments about the prob-
abilities that it will rain on days 1, 2, and 3, and it decides to plan the picnic for 
day 1. On day 0, the probabilities of rain on day 1 are between 0 and 1. On day 1 
itself, the probability of rain is either 0 or 1. It either rains or it does not rain. Based 
on whether or not it rains on day 1, the family may postpone the picnic from day 
1 to day 2 or 3, or based on the experience of having seen a heavy rain on day 1, 
they may revise the probabilities of rain on days 2 and 3 upward and decide to 
postpone the picnic to another season. Given the experience with day 1, the parents 
have learned something (perhaps not much) about the probability of rain at this 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 65
time of year and have revised their estimates of the probability of rain in the near 
term accordingly. 
 In the context of the smoking decision, although the probability of developing 
a persistent cough or a more serious chronic illness such as COPD is increased by 
smoking, not everyone who smokes develops a persistent cough or COPD. Some 
smokers may decide to quit smoking once they learn that smoking makes them 
cough. Others who do not cough when they smoke may reason that smoking may 
be harmful to others but not to themselves, and these people may be more likely 
to continue to smoke. In essence, the smokers learn over time about  their own 
health risks of smoking; this risk varies among smokers because of genetics and 
other factors. 
 Is the Economic Framework of Health Behavior Decision 
Making Plausible? 
 The economic framework of decision making just described will certainly give 
those who remember their teenage years, or who have been parents of teenagers 
recently, pause. One ’ s first reaction is likely to be, teenagers do not think this way! 
They do not think ahead to the consequences of their current actions. Many would 
say much the same about the behavior of adults as well. 
 Mainstream economists have several responses to these concerns. First, laws 
permitting adults to engage in potentially harmful health behaviors ordinarily 
assume that adults can make informed intertemporal choices. The alternative is to 
ask government to engage in loco parentis. Second, to the extent that adults, includ-
ing young adults, have difficulty forming probabilities and thinking about utilities 
in alternative states of the world, states they have not personally experienced, there 
is a role for public health education strategies, such as tobacco control programs, 
to provide this information. Third, people engage in health behaviors that are often 
contrary to their continuing to be in good health because they are physically 
addicted. The answer to this objection is that the decision depicted above occurs 
 before becoming addicted, and also, physical addiction can be represented in an 
economic framework as the (dis)utility of quitting. Fourth, economists argue that 
one should not judge a model by its assumptions but on the basis of empirical tests 
of its predictions. There is empirical evidence that people quit smoking after receiv-
ing bad news about their health ( Sloan, Smith, and Taylor 2003 ). Many of the health 
messages are quite serious and attributable to smoking, such as a heart attack, 
stroke, or the onset of COPD. People update their subjective beliefs about longevity 
following adverse health events ( Smith, Taylor, Sloan, et al. 2001 ). Information 
updating can be rational and part of an economic model of health decision making. 
If models based on alternative assumptions, for example myopia and time incon-
sistency, biased beliefs about the outcomes stemming from various health behav-
iors, let them compete with the traditional economic frameworks. If they provide 
better explanatory power, they are worth using.

 Economic Evidence on Health Behaviors and Public Policy 
Implications 
 There is a large literature on demand for medical care services. We leave a discus-
sion of empirical evidence from this literature to the next chapter. We discuss 
empirical evidence on health behaviors, including those that have potential adverse 
effects on health, here. 
 Economic models of decision making offer predictions of the effect of price 
changes on demand, and the economic analysis of health behaviors is no exception. 
Economists view empirical evidence that people respond to changes in prices of 
products that are potentially harmful to health as evidence that their framework 
has predictive value. When the price of a good, such as a pack of cigarettes, rises, 
the expected utility of becoming a smoker falls. Economic studies show that the 
demand for cigarettes and alcoholic behaviors respond to price changes (see, e.g., 
 Chaloupka and Warner 2000 ;  Cook and Moore 2000 ). 
 Economists distinguish between the  extensive margin  and the  intensive 
margin . The extensive margin refers to whether or not  any  amount of the good or 
service is consumed. The intensive margin refers to consumption, conditional on 
at least one unit being consumed. The decision to smoke, a decision at the extensive 
margin, is negatively correlated with the price of cigarettes, with an associated 
elasticity of about  – 0.48 (see  Cawley 2008 ). This suggests that raising the excise 
tax on cigarettes is an effective policy instrument for reducing rates of smoking. 
Price appears to be a factor in boys starting to smoke but not girls ( Gilleskie and 
Strumpf 2005 ). The decision to be a current alcohol drinker has a price elasticity 
of  – 0.55, and the prevalence of beer drinking among youths has a price elasticity 
of  – 0.2 ( Cawley 2008 ). On the intensive margin, for example the number of ciga-
rettes smoked by smokers per day, higher prices of cigarettes have a greater deter-
rent effect on heavy smoking (11+ cigarettes daily) than on lighter smoking (6 – 10 
cigarettes daily), but higher prices have important effects on both. 
 Gertler, Shah, and Bertozzi (2005)  reported the results of a survey of over 
1,000 prostitutes in Mexico. Unlike tobacco and alcohol, participation in commer-
cial sex involves negotiation between the consumer and the seller. The authors 
found, for example, that prostitutes charged 23 percent more for unprotected sex, 
a measure of quality of commercial sex services. This suggests that markets for this 
type of activity are not that different from markets for other goods and services. 
This finding also illustrates trade-offs between some other objective and good 
health. If the consumers of this service were mainly concerned about staying in 
good health, the price of prostitution services would be higher, not lower, for pro-
tected sex. 
 Some substance abuse treatment programs use financial incentives to rein-
force therapy. The incentives can take the form of vouchers that clients receive if 
they are compliant with therapy. One study estimated that vouchers increased 
compliance with therapy by an average of 30 percent ( Cawley 2008 ). Again, the 
subsidies raise the relative return of not using the addictive good. 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 67
 The assumption of rationality does not require that consumers have perfect 
information. As consumers learn more, their behaviors often change. One type of 
information relates to scientific findings, such as those embodied in the US Surgeon 
General ’ s report on the harms of smoking in 1964. There is some evidence that the 
report led to an immediate reduction in smoking rates (see  Cawley 2008 ), although 
whether or not the response was due to the report has been disputed since there 
was adverse publicity about the harms of smoking before the report appeared 
( Sloan, Smith, and Taylor 2002 ). 
 The Surgeon General ’ s report and journal articles about the adverse effects of 
smoking provide consumers with general information. Nearly everyone is able to 
tell a story about someone who smoked for decades and lived a long and healthy 
life. The effects of smoking indeed vary from individual to individual, and a person 
has no way of knowing in advance whether or not he or she will develop a smoking-
related illness. 
 2.7 
 Frontier Issues: The Behavioral Economics 
Critique — Theory and Evidence 
 Formal economic models of rational choice are attractive analytically, but they have 
many critics, even within the economics profession, and certainly among scholars 
in other disciplines. Each of us can tell stories that seem quite inconsistent with 
rational, forward-looking, and time-consistent decision making. 
 For example, teenagers think they are invulnerable. They can smoke and quit 
any time they wish.  5 Why would a buyer in autumn be lured to purchase a product 
by an advertisement offering no money down on the product and no interest pay-
ments until next year, although the seller may more than make up from its seeming 
generosity by charging higher interest after January 1 of the following year? A car 
dealer raises the hoods on its new cars for passersby to see. Why would a person 
buy a new car because he saw a bunch of hoods raised, presumably a subliminal 
greeting? As for health behaviors, why would seeing a comic-looking camel induce 
one to smoke Camels or young people running along a beach and laughing to drink 
beer? It would seem that the camel (e.g.,  “ Joe Camel ” in old Camel cigarette adver-
tisements, now banned by US law) would not reveal much information about the 
quality of the smoke or even about the quality of Camel cigarettes. Beer consump-
tion should reduce one ’ s ability to run on the beach, although perhaps it encourages 
one to laugh. 
 Economists specializing in the field of behavioral economics are borrowing 
concepts from the field of psychology to answer these questions. The use of addic-
tive substances is particularly interesting because their use and abuse seem to 
violate standard assumptions of economic models, but other health behaviors are 
pertinent as well. 6 
5.  An interesting 
economics article seeks 
to explain the 
phenomenon of 
 “ accidental ad  diction. ”  
See Orphanides and 
Zervos (1995).
6.  Decades ago, the 
Nobel Laureate in 
Economics, Herbert 
Simon, questioned the 
standard assumption of 
economics that people 
make rational 
decisions, argu ing 
people are partly 
rational because of 
limits in processing 
information relevant to 
some of the decisions 
they make. Some 
decisions are reached 
on an emotional or 
irrational basis. He 
coined the term 
 “ bounded rationality. ” 
More recently, cognitive 
psychologists  Tversky 
and Kahneman (1981)  
went even further than 
Simon, demonstrating 
that people do not 
make rational decisions 
even for simple 
problems. For their 
work, Kahneman was 
awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Economics. 
Tversky had died 
earlier, and Nobel 
Prizes are awarded only 
to living persons. All 
three sc  holars would 
question whether 
people have the 
cognitive capacity to 
make the rational 
choice of whether or 
not to begin and 
conditional on 
be ginning to quit 
smoking using the 
framework de  picted 
in equation 2.8, 
appendix 2A.

68 
 Part I / Chapter 2
 Cawley (2008 ), in a review of the literature on addictive behaviors, distin-
guished among three alternative models of addictive behavior: perfectly rational, 
imperfectly rational, and irrational. The best-known model that deals with addic-
tive behavior and that is based on the assumption of rationality is  Gary Becker and 
Kevin Murphy ’ s (1988)  rational addiction model. In their framework, addiction is 
a choice of a rational utility-maximizing individual with stable preferences. Three 
important features characterize addictive behavior: (1)  Tolerance . Higher levels of 
past consumption of an addictive good make a specific level of current consump-
tion less satisfying. (2)  Withdrawal . Addicted individuals feel worse when they 
stop consuming the good. (3)  Reinforcement . Persons who consume more of the 
addictive good derive higher satisfaction from consuming an extra unit; the higher 
marginal return from consuming more leads to even higher levels of consumption 
of the addictive good. 
 The Becker-Murphy model explains that even persons who consume addic-
tive goods can be forward-looking and use available information to compare future 
benefits with the adverse consequences of their present actions. In fact, a major 
motivation for the model was to show how the consumption of addictive goods 
can be incorporated into a standard economic framework. 
 Because of reinforcement, the model predicts that the way to successful ces-
sation is to quit  “ cold turkey. ” Gradual quitting does not work in this model 
because the addict will always derive a lot of satisfaction from smoking a cigarette. 
Thus, the path to successful quitting requires that the habit be broken, reducing 
marginal utility from smoking a cigarette. 
 Alternatively, individuals are imperfectly rational about the consumption of 
addictive goods. They are imperfectly rational in the sense that, while accounting 
for the future consequences of present actions, they may (1) have time-inconsistent 
preferences, (2) misperceive the probability of harm following from their current 
behavior, (3) have cognitive difficulties in forming probabilities or learning from 
the experiences of others, or (4) have imperfect information about their own prob-
ability of getting addicted. 
 Imperfect information about the probability of becoming addicted mainly 
applies to younger persons.  Orphanides and Zervos (1995)  and  Wang (2007)  devel-
oped models in which individuals have imperfect information about their own 
propensities to become addicted. Youths experiment with addictive goods and get 
addicted  “ unexpectedly. ” These models can explain such empirical failures of the 
perfectly rational addiction model as  “ randomness of addiction, ”  “ unhappy 
addicts, ”  and  “ failed attempts to quit smoking. ”  Fudenberg and Levine (2006)  
constructed a simple  “ dual-self ”  model that provides a unified explanation for 
phenomena unexplained by the perfectly rational addiction model, including time 
inconsistency/hyperbolic discounting. 
 In the dual-self model, people may know what is best for them, but they 
realize that in certain situations, when in the other self, they may not act in their 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 69
long-run self interest. Therefore, people employ self-control mechanisms. An argu-
ment against the use of excise taxes is their regressivity. Such taxes impose a rela-
tively higher burden on the poor than on the non-poor. However, the price elasticity 
of demand for cigarettes is higher for the poor than for others ( Gruber, Sen, and 
Stabile 2003 ). Using a framework of imperfect rationality,  Gruber and K ö szegi 
(2004 ) argued that excise taxes act as an aid to self-control, in that they help people 
control their ability to abstain from smoking cigarettes. When the benefit of promot-
ing self-control is considered, excise taxes are much less regressive than is typically 
alleged. 
 In the irrational model, decisions are mainly influenced by emotions experi-
enced when consumption decisions are made ( Loewenstein 2001 ). Emotional reac-
tions to risky situations often diverge from objective assessments of risks, and when 
a divergence occurs between effect and choices based on objective evaluation of 
risk versus benefit, emotional reactions tend to dominate. The consumption 
of addictive goods may result from visceral urges provoked by external cues, 
which lead to impulsive behaviors, which do not occur absent the external cues 
( Loewenstein 1999 ). 
 More formally, the decision maker ’ s brain switches between  “ hot ”  and  “ cold ” 
states ( Bernheim and Rangel 2004 ). The decision maker consumes harmful addic-
tive goods while in the hot state and makes rational choices while in the cold state. 
This framework is consistent with several stylized facts about addiction, such as 
the high likelihood of a relapse following quit attempts. Acting on emotions and 
impulses may explain how Joe Camel advertisements or raised automobile hoods 
increase the consumption of these products. 
 2.8 
 Summary and Conclusions 
 Analysis of decisions people make about their health is important for several 
reasons. Demand for personal health services, the subject of the next chapter, is a 
demand derived from demand for health. Health investments undertaken today 
have important implications for personal health at a later date, and these decisions 
are made under conditions of uncertainty. The subject provides an opportunity to 
review (or learn for the first time) the distinction between capital stock and invest-
ment flows and the determinants of optimal capital stock from the vantage point 
of the company owner, or in our case the individual decision maker. We describe 
how changes in age, wages, and educational attainment affect demand for health 
capital. Each one of these topics is an important subject in its own right. There are 
dozens of books and journal articles on each topic, or even more. We have merely 
scratched the surface in this chapter. Hopefully, some readers will continue their 
study of this important area. 

70 
 Part I / Chapter 2
 Health behaviors are highly germane to us all. The topic of health behaviors 
provides a fruitful context for investigating and assessing alternative models of 
personal decision making, including whether or not people are rational, forward-
looking, and time consistent when making important personal decisions — a very 
controversial set of questions that is by no means yet resolved. 
 Many of the concepts introduced in this chapter have very broad applicabil-
ity. For example, decisions such as the physician ’ s decision to test or not to test 
for streptococcal infection applies in a very wide variety of contexts, not just per-
sonal health and personal decision making. Firms evaluate various options on a 
daily basis, employing the same framework, at least implicitly. Government agen-
cies are often advised by outside groups to use such techniques, whether they 
actually use them or not.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 2.1 
 Economics often uses the household as the decision-making unit. What pre-
cisely is meant by a  “ household ”  as the term is used in economics? What do 
you see as the key advantages and disadvantages of analyzing the household 
as the decision-making unit in the context of health economics decision 
making? 

Health and Health Behaviors

 2.2  
 Economists often assume that people are rational and forward-looking in their 
decisions. What is really meant by the terms  “ rational ”  and  “ forward-look-
ing ” ? Give concrete examples of a decision in which people are likely to be 
rational and forward-looking and one in which this assumption seems less 
tenable. What empirical tests would you use to determine whether people are 
rational and forward-looking in a particular context or not? 
 2.3  
 In this chapter, as in economics literature, we refer to health as a form of 
 capital  and term it as  human capital . List at least two similarities and differ-
ences between  physical capital  and  human capital . By treating health as a 
form of capital, what are the costs and benefits (returns) of holding health 
capital? 
 2.4  
 What is meant by the term  “ behavioral economics ” ? Give three examples in 
which concepts from behavioral economics have been applied. In what ways 
did behavioral economics provide insights that standard neoclassical eco-
nomics would not have provided? 
 Exercises 
 2.1   A patient with arthritis of the knee is planning to have a knee replacement. 
He has applied for a loan for this surgery; the loan has an annual interest rate 
of 6 percent. The artificial knee can function for 10 years before it needs to be 
replaced. Fees for knee replacement surgery are expected to grow at 5 percent 
annually. 
 a.   Why is an artificial knee a form of health capital? 
 b.   Assume the artificial knee depreciates at a constant rate every year until the 
time of replacement, which is 10 years hence. What is the cost of this capital? 
 c.   Suppose that instead of a loan, the patient plans to pay the surgery from his or 
her own savings. Assume that the bank ’ s interest rate on savings deposits equals 
its rate on loans. Does this change your answer to (b)? Why or why not? 
 d.    Draw the COC (cost of capital) line on a graph, with health capital on the  x -axis 
and the COC rate on the  y -axis. What is the slope of the COC schedule? Explain 
why it looks the way it does. 
 2.2.   Suppose a hospital has 500 beds. It faces a demand curve  x = 1,200  – 2 p , 
where  p is the price of a bed day and  x is the number of patient days of care 
demanded. The fixed cost of adding a new bed is $150 and the total  housekeeping 
cost is given by  C = ( B /3.5), 2 where  B is the total number of beds. 

72 
 Part I / Chapter 2
 a.   Suppose the hospital ’ s market price is fixed at $250/bed day. What is the net 
marginal revenue to this hospital from an increase of one additional bed? 
 b.   With  p fixed at 250, graph the net marginal revenue curve, with the number of 
beds on the  x -axis and dollars on the  y -axis. Explain its shape. 
 c.   Suppose the hospital is restricted from increasing its capacity for now, but it 
can set the price for each bed day. What is the optimal price level for the hospital 
if the hospital ’ s objective is to maximize profits? Will the hospital fully use its 
current capacity in this case? 
 d.    Now suppose the hospital is considering building a branch in another town. 
There is no existing hospital in that town. The cost of each new bed and house-
keeping are the same as above, but the hospital ’ s demand curve in this other 
town is  x = 800  – 1.2 p . What is its profit-maximizing price per bed day? How 
many beds should the new hospital have? 
 2.3  Assume the health production function is  h = 365  – 1/ H , where  h is the 
number of healthy days a person has in each year and  H is the person ’ s health 
capital. Assume this person earns a wage of $100/day, and the marginal cost of 
health investment  π = 25 and is constant over time. The annual interest rate is 5 
percent, and health capital depreciates at a rate of 15 percent per annum. 
 a.   What does the MEC for this person ’ s health capital look like? Draw the MEC 
curve on a graph, with health capital on the  x -axis and the rate of return on the 
 y -axis. Explain the shape of this MEC curve. 
 b.   What is the cost of health capital in this problem? 
 c.   Find the optimal level of health this person demands under the above 
conditions. 
 d.    Suppose the person acquires a  chronic disease  and his health depreciation rate 
rises to 35 percent annually. How does this change your answer to part (c)? 
 e.   Suppose instead of having a chronic disease the person experiences a recession 
and his wage falls to $50/day. Assume the change in the price of time inputs 
accounts for 20 percent of the total change in cost of a unit of health investment. 
Show graphically how this change affects the MEC curve. What is the person ’ s 
optimal health demand now? 
 f.   Now focus on the role of human capital in this model. Suppose a person ’ s edu-
cational attainment increases. How does the MEC curve shift in this case? How 
does this shift affect the person ’ s investment in health capital? 
 2.4  A person with osteoarthritis of the knee (a common condition in middle-aged 
and elderly individuals) plans to have a knee replacement. Assume he has a 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 73
quasi-linear utility function ( U ( · )) over wage  w and his health  H . That is,  U ( w , H ) 
=  w + 10 4 ln H . Suppose with an artificial knee, the person can enjoy 20 additional 
healthy days annually during the next 10 years, during which he can earn a wage 
of $150/day. The annual interest rate is 2 percent. 
 a.   What is the increase in the person ’ s wage income if the person decides to get 
his knee replaced? 
 b.   What is the net present value of the monetary return on knee replacement 
surgery? 
 Now suppose that in addition to the above conditions, the person also has a current 
health capital of 500 units. In the next decade, the additional health capital attrib-
utable to the artificial knee is given in the following table:

 The patient discounts his utility from health capital at a 10 percent annual rate. 
That is, he is indifferent between receiving 100 units of health capital this year 
and receiving 110 units next year. 
 c.   What is the present value of his utility gain from having knee replacement 
surgery? 
 d.    If the total cost (including both the monetary loss from paying the surgical fee 
and the disutility from undergoing the surgery and recovering) is 30,000, should 
the person undergo the surgical procedure? 
 2.5   Suppose a person is asked a standard gamble question about three kinds of 
diseases. For each disease, the person decides to undergo surgery if the expected 
utility from the operation exceeds or is equal to the patient ’ s utility if he or she 
does not undergo surgery and continues having the disease. The person ’ s expected 
utility is therefore (1  –  Θ ) U a +  Θ U d , where  U a is the utility if the operation is suc-
cessful,  U d is the utility if it fails, and  Θ is the probability of failure. The patient 
assigns the following probabilities of surgical failure to the diseases: 
 Disease 
 A 
 B 
 C 
 Θ

 0.4 
 0.01 

74 
 Part I / Chapter 2
 a.   Assume  U a = 1 and  U d = 0. Then what is the utility of having each of the diseases 
if the person is indifferent between having and not having the operation? 
 b.   If the diseases are liver cancer, glaucoma, and dental caries, which one is most 
likely to be denoted as A above? 
 Viscusi and Evans (1990 ) took a similar approach to analyzing the loss in utility 
from being healthy to becoming sick. In the experiment they discussed in their 
paper, workers were randomly assigned to label four different chemicals: asbestos, 
TNT, sodium bicarbonate, and chloroacetophenone. The first two chemicals are 
quite dangerous and could cause death if they exploded. The third is rather harm-
less, and the fourth will only cause some tearing if proper treatment is not received. 
The authors asked the workers how much money they would have to receive in 
compensation if they were reassigned to label another chemical. 
 We will now apply the standard gamble concept to this problem. Assume the 
workers ’ utility function is  U ( w ) = ln w , where  w is the hourly wage received from 
the labeling work and  U (death) = 0. 
 c.   The probability of TNT exploding is  Θ TNT , and if it explodes, the worker cannot 
survive. Also suppose the wage of labeling sodium bicarbonate is  w S per hour. 
What is the minimum wage a worker must receive if he were reassigned to label 
TNT as a function of  Θ TNT and  w S ? 
 d.    Which labeling work must have a higher wage, asbestos or chloroaceto-
phenone? 
 e.   What is the wage function for chloroacetophenone? Use  w S as the benchmark 
again. Which value(s) do you need to be able to solve this problem? 
 f.   One major implication of Viscusi and Evans ’ s research is that people may have 
different utility functions when healthy than when sick. Suppose the utility 
function is  V ( w ) = 0.5ln w if the worker is sick but alive. How does this change 
your answer to part (e)? 
 2.6  Consider the following scenario, which is slightly different from the throat 
culture example in the chapter. A parent makes a decision about her child ’ s care 
when the child is suspected to be infected by streptococci. The parent has three 
choices: ask the physician to give her child an antibiotic without performing the 
culture, perform the culture and give the child antibiotics only if the result is posi-
tive, or do nothing. If the child receives an antibiotic without being infected, she 
will develop a resistance to antibiotics (i.e., antibiotics will not kill infections that 
the child may get in the future) with probability  Θ ar and cost  C ar for further treat-
ment. If she is infected and receives the antibiotic, she will be cured immediately 
without any side effects. If she is infected but not treated, the infection will develop 
into a rheumatic heart disease, which will cost  C rf as a result. The probability of 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 75
being infected before the treatment, which is known by the parent, is  Θ s . The cost 
of antibiotics is  C a and the cost of a culture is  C c . The values for these probabilities 
and costs are given below:

ics without having the test performed? 
 c.   If the parent ’ s object is to minimize expected cost, what is her optimal 
decision? 
 d.    What if the probability of infection fell from 0.5 to 0.2? Would this change your 
answer to part (c)?

 Appendix 2A: Application to Decision to Start and 
Stop Smoking 
 To illustrate how health behaviors fit into an economic framework when the out-
comes of the behaviors are uncertain, we model the decision of a person to start 
smoking and to quit smoking at a later date if he or she begins to experience adverse 
health consequences of smoking. The decision to start smoking is based on a com-
parison of the expected utility if the person smokes compared to the expected 
utility if the person does not smoke. Expected utility reflects (1) utilities in each 
period associated with each outcome of the decision, (2) beliefs about the probabili-
ties of various outcomes at the time the smoking decision is made, (3) decision 
rules to be used in the future conditional on observing specific types of informa-
tion, and (4) the person ’ s subjective rate of discount  r . 
 Suppose that there are three periods in one ’ s life: youth (period 0), young 
adulthood (period 1), and mature adulthood (period 2). In period 0, the person 
decides whether or not to begin smoking. In period 1, the smoker decides whether 
or not to quit. If the smoker does not quit before entering period 2, it is too late to 
change his or her mind. The person is in the hands of his or her genes and past 
smoking behavior. No one starts smoking after period 0. 
 When the person begins smoking in period 0, the person does not know how 
smoking will affect his or her personal health. In fact, in period 0, there are no 
adverse health events to signal whether or not the person ’ s genetic heritage is such 
that smoking will adversely affect health. Even the youth ’ s parents are likely to be 
too young to have experienced major health shocks from smoking yet. However, 
the person is assumed to know the probability that he or she will experience a 
signal of worsening health in period 1; an example of a period 1 signal is periodic 
coughing spells. Some smokers who experience periodic coughing spells in period 
1 develop COPD in period 2, but many coughers, in the fact the majority of such 
persons, do not get COPD. For smokers who continue to smoke into period 2, the 
probability of receiving bad news, that is, of getting COPD, depends on whether or 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 77
not the smoker received an adverse health signal in period 1. If the person receives 
bad news in period 1, he or she has a greater likelihood of receiving  additional 
bad news in period 2 — that is, the probability that COPD will develop — than 
if the person does not receive bad news in period 1. But even if the news in 
period 1 is good, there is still a chance that the person will receive bad news in 
period 2. 
 The decision to initiate smoking can be depicted by a  “ game tree ” (  fig. 2.6 ). 
Typically the games in game theory involve two players. Here the game is between 
the individual and nature, which is the other player. Nature reveals good or bad 
news, which the individual uses to decide whether or not to make midcourse cor-
rections, such as whether or not to quit smoking. 
 We now describe the four elements of the game tree: (1) utilities, (2) beliefs 
the individual has at the time the smoking decision is made about receiving good 
or bad news, (3) the decision rule guiding midcourse corrections in period 1, and 
(4) the person ’ s subjective rate of discount. 
 The utility of smoking is  U S . Smoking yields various benefits to the smoker, 
including enjoyment of the taste, relief of stress, having something to do with one ’ s

hands, and impressing one ’ s peers. Thus, when the person does not experience 
harm from smoking, he or she enjoys the utility of smoking  U S in each period with 
 U S  > 0. Let  U 0 be the utility of never smoking. To simplify the analysis, we set this 
utility to zero ( U 0 = 0).  U S  >  U 0 . 
 For persons who start smoking in period 0 and stop in period 1, we assign a 
utility of  U X , where  U X  < 0. This utility is negative because (1) there is a cost 
to breaking the smoking habit and (2) persons who quit may experience some 
permanent harm to health, although less that that for continuing smokers on 
average. We assume that if the person quits in period 1, he or she experiences 
the same health in period 2 as a person who never smokes. In period 2, if the 
smoker gets COPD, he or she is permanently disabled with a utility of  U SD , where 
 U SD  <  U X  < 0. 
 In period 1, nature determines whether the person receives good ( G ) or bad 
news ( B ) about the person ’ s health.  G news could be no smoking-related symptoms 
and  B news could be a smoking-related symptom such as becoming tired after 
walking several blocks, a symptom the person did not observe in period 1. Based 
on the signal received, the person can quit smoking with a net utility cost of  U X , 
which is negative. Otherwise, the person continues to smoke with utility at  U S . In 
period 2, nature reveals to the person whether the person will remain healthy with 
utility  U S or suffer a smoking-related disease, such as COPD, with associated utility 
of  U SD . 
 In period 0, the person has subjective beliefs about receiving good or bad 
news in periods 1 and in period 2, conditional on having received good or bad 
news in period 1.  Θ B is the probability of receiving bad news in period 1;  Θ G , 
the probability of good news in period 1, that is, of receiving no signal of adverse 
health in period 1 is (1  –  Θ B ) =  Θ G . Since in period 0 the individual has not yet 
received news that will first come in period 1, she also forms probabilities in period 
0 of the type of news she will receive in periods 1 and 2 if she decides to start 
smoking. Further, let  Θ BB be the probability that a smoker receives bad news 
in period 2, given that she received bad news in period 1; if the cough does 
not get any worse or goes away by period 2, goods news follows bad news. The 
probability of good news in period 2 conditional on bad news in period 1 is  Θ BG . 
The probability of bad news following bad news is higher than the probability of 
good news following bad news, that is,  Θ BB  >  Θ BG . Just because a smoker did not 
receive bad news in period 1 does not rule out the possibility that a smoker will 
develop COPD in period 2. For such persons, the period 2 probability is  Θ GB . 
Finally, there is the probability that smokers are indeed immune to the harms of 
smoking  Θ GG . 
 The third building block of the game tree is the person ’ s decision rule about 
whether or not to quit smoking, based on the new information received. In this 
highly simplified model, the only decision available to the person once smoking 
has been initiated in period 0 is whether or not to quit in period 1. The decision 

Health and Health Behaviors 
 79
to continue smoking or alternatively to quit is based on utilities in periods 1 and 
2, probabilities of receiving good or bad news given the information about the 
person ’ s health available in period 1, and the person ’ s discount rate. 
 Fourth, discount rates are expected to vary among individuals. Persons with 
higher discount rates are more likely to begin smoking in period 0 since the benefits 
of smoking accrue to the individual before the costs from this activity do. Since 
the focus here is not on discounting, we assume that individuals are time consistent 
with a single rate of discount ( r ). 
 To summarize, ex post, that is, during period 2, one will learn for sure 
whether or not one is immune to the health harms of smoking. But ex ante, that is 
when the initiation decision is made during youth, all the decision maker knows 
are the probabilities for periods 1 and 2. In period 1, the smoker decides whether 
or not to quit or not, with quitting only being an option in period 1. Afterward, the 
smoker continues as a nonsmoker. (In this scenario, the adage  “ it is never too late 
to quit ” does not apply. After period 1, it is too late.) In period 2, either the smoker 
gets COPD and becomes disabled for life (death does not add any new insights to 
this framework) or remains healthy for life.  7 
 In period 0, the expected utility for youths who are thinking about starting 
smoking is ( Sloan, Smith, and Taylor 2003 ): 
 U S +  Θ G max{ Θ GG U S + (1  –  Θ GG ) U SD )/(1 +  r ) 2 +  U S /(1 +  r ),  U X /(1 +  r )} 
+ {(1  –  Θ G )max( Θ BG U S + (1  –  Θ BG ) U SD )/(1 +  r ) 2 +  U S /(1 +  r ),  U X /(1 +  r ))}. 
(2.8) 
 If the value of equation 2.8 is positive, the youth starts smoking, and con-
versely, if the value is negative, the youth does not smoke and enjoys zero expected 
utility. 
 We now examine equation 2.8 term by term. In period 0, the person ’ s utility 
from smoking is  U S . In period 1, the person receives good or bad news in the form 
of smoking-related symptoms. In period 0, the decision maker thinks that these 
probabilities as  Θ G and (1  –  Θ G ), respectively. The second term, which begins with 
 Θ G , pertains to the period 1 decision in which the person receives good news in 
period 1 — no smoking-related symptoms, and the third term, which begins with 
(1  –  Θ G ), pertains to the period 1 decision in which the person receives bad news 
in period 1. 
 Now suppose the person obtains good news. Then she decides whether or 
not to quit. If the person continues to smoke, she obtains utility  U S in period 1, 
since it is too late to quit in period 2, realizes utility  U S if she remains in good 
health  or  U SD if she experiences a smoking-related disease in period 2. Alterna-
tively, if she quits in period 1, the utility in period 1 is  U X . The decision maker 
bases the decision on whether or not to quit in period 1 on whether utility from 
the vantage point of period 1 is higher if the person continues to smoke or not, 
which is what the max term implies. 
7.  The expected utility 
is the sum of utilities in 
each state (e.g., utility 
in good and in bad 
health), weighted by 
the pro bability that 
the state occurs. For 
example, if the 
probability of being in 
good health is 0.9, the 
probability of being in 
bad health is 0.1, and 
if the utilities in good 
and in bad health are 
90 and 30, respectively, 
the expected utility 
is 84.

 Part I / Chapter 2
 If the person receives bad news in period 2, except for the differences in the 
probabilities of utilities in period 2, the problem is the same as when good news 
is received. The probability of a bad outcome in period 2 is higher than when there 
is good news in period 1. Thus, the probability of quitting in period 2 is higher in 
this case. 
 Figure 2.6  and equation 2.8 illustrate how the composite of assumptions 
reduce the decision of whether or not to start smoking to appearing if all is 
known by the beginning smoker. In fact, by treating the decision as a sequence of 
first steps at each period, we allow the person to revise the perceived probabilities 
of good and bad news. The person may also update his or her beliefs about the 
probabilities based on receiving general information about the harms of smoking 
or observing, for example, a relative who smoked develop a chronically disabling 
condition. 
 In this framework, there is no explicit role for medical care. At the cost of 
added complexity, one could allow for the possibility that medical care is produc-
tive in treating any smoking-related disease that may occur in period 2, thereby 
linking a health behavior to medical care use. Medical care could reduce  U SD but 
at the cost of reduced consumption of other goods (to the extent that medical care 
is not covered by health insurance), which would reduce utility.  
 This analysis offers several important implications. First, people who are 
more optimistic about receiving good news later in the life course will be more 
likely to start smoking. Second, persons with a higher rate of time preference, 
a higher  r , are more likely to start smoking since the cost of smoking mainly 
occurs later in the life course — in this stylized example, only later. Third, persons 
who attach a lower cost to quitting or who derive more pleasure from cigarette 
consumption or impressing their peers would be more likely to initiate the smoking 
habit.

 Demand for Health Care Services 
 This chapter focuses on demand for health care services, including preventive, 
diagnostic, and therapeutic services. Examples of preventive services are vaccina-
tions, counseling about proper diet and physical exercise, and routine dental 
examinations, including teeth cleaning. A drug that lowers blood pressure or cho-
lesterol may prevent a heart attack or a stroke. The use of glucose monitoring 
equipment may prevent the onset of complications of diabetes. Diagnostic tests, 
such as mammography and colonoscopy (tests to detect cancerous or precancerous 
tumors of the breast and colon, respectively), are in a sense preventive as well in 
that these tests may detect polyps and very small tumors before they grow into 
larger malignant tumors. Various tests for detecting heart disease, such as electro-
cardiography, which measures the electrical activity of the heart, also fall in this 
category. Therapeutic services treat disease, by means of either drugs, or medical 
devices (such as a pacemaker for cardiac disease), or radiation, or a surgical 
procedure. 
 A person ’ s demand for personal health care services is a derived demand, 
with the final product being good health. Personal health care services are an 
input in the health production function, as are good diet, exercise, and adequate 
sleep. 
 Economists study demand for several reasons. First, individuals are fre-
quently insured for many health services. Demand curves for health services are 
downward sloping, as are demand curves for other goods and services. Insurance 
coverage lowers the price of health services to individuals, leading to increases in 
the quantity of such services demanded. Private and public health insurers need 
to know how responsive the quantity demanded is to price reductions that occur 

84 
 Part I / Chapter 3
when there is health insurance coverage. Private insurers need to know what 
premium to charge. Public insurers need to forecast budgetary outlays when they 
extend coverage to a new health service or for projections to determine the future 
financial status of the program. The change in quantity demanded for a change in 
the price of care paid out of pocket by insured persons is called  moral hazard . 
There is nothing immoral about moral hazard, although, as discussed in this 
chapter, the existence of moral hazard is important from the vantage point of social 
welfare. 
 A second reason for studying demand is to assess differences in the use of 
services among various groups, defined on the basis of household income, urban 
versus rural residential status, or race and ethnicity. While moral hazard is impor-
tant in terms of how it affects the allocation of scarce resources, how health services 
are allocated is important for equity reasons. In a market economy, the distribution 
of goods and services is most often left to the actions of market forces. Patterns of 
buying trucks and tennis shoes are not a public concern. However, consumption 
patterns of personal health care services are a legitimate public concern. For one, 
there are health externalities in the consumption of some services, such as vaccina-
tions. Such externalities arise because the health of person B is potentially affected 
by the consumption of the service by person A. When person A fails to be vacci-
nated for influenza, person B may be more likely to become infected with this 
disease. But the distribution of health services is also a public matter for reasons 
of social justice. There are externalities in consumption simply because person A 
does not receive adequate care, even if the failure to receive such care does not 
make person B more likely to become ill. Person B is made better off by person A ’ s 
consumption of the service simply because he feels good when A is receiving what 
she needs. Goods that have this property are termed  “ merit wants. ” There is a 
public interest in child nutrition not because malnutrition is infectious but, in part, 
because of a consensus that all children should have access to adequate diets. 
Another reason is that undernourished children may receive less education as 
children and be in poorer health as adults, an issue discussed in the previous 
chapter. 
 Third, forecasts of demand are needed for many long-term decisions, just as 
forecasts of future traffic flows are needed for planning the size of a bridge. Public 
policy makers need to consider future demand when making investments in 
medical school capacity or hospitals. Similarly, long-term forecasts of health care 
expenditures are needed for projecting revenue inflows needed to be allocated 
currently to cover future expenditure outflows. 
 Businesses involved in health services provision have a vital interest in 
demand, both for purposes of deciding on prices, quantity, and quality levels and 
also for gauging the profitability of investments in new products. Private insurers 
need to know about demand to structure plan benefits and pricing and set 
premiums. 

Demand for Health Care Services 
 85
 This chapter focuses on the responsiveness of quantity demanded to the price 
paid by the consumer-patient out of pocket. This topic encompasses the influence 
of prices on demand and interrelationships in demand among various types of 
personal health services. For example, if the price of a preventive service is reduced, 
what is the impact on the quantity of therapeutic services demanded? For example, 
if the price of blood pressure medication is reduced, can one expect savings in the 
use of therapeutic services devoted to the care of persons who have sustained heart 
attacks? 
 3.1 
 Basic Economic Concepts of Demand 
 Economists measure the percent change in quantity demanded for a percent change 
in price as a price elasticity. Elasticities are convenient for expressing the respon-
siveness of quantity demanded to price changes. Let  Δ x i be the change in quantity 
of good  i demanded for a given change in price  Δ p i . Then the  own-price elasticity 
is the percentage change in quantity,  Δ x i / x i , divided by the percentage change in 
price,  Δ p i / p i : 
 ( Δ x i / x i )/( Δ p i / p i ) = ( Δ x i / Δ p i )  ⋅ ( p i / x i ). 
(3.1) 
 With a linear demand curve, the own-price elasticity depends on the values 
of  p and  x at which the elasticity is evaluated. Often, the elasticity is evaluated at 
the mean values of  p i and  x i . A demand curve can be obtained by fitting a regres-
sion line to the data. 
 Alternatively, the price elasticity can be derived using the concept of arc 
elasticity. To see how an arc elasticity is calculated, suppose we have data on two 
quantity-price combinations, ( x 1 ,p 1 ) and ( x 2 ,p 2 ). Then the arc elasticity is given by 
 (( x 1  –  x 2 )/( x 1 +  x 2 )/2/( p 1  –  p 2 )/( p 1 +  p 2 )/2) 
= (( x 1  –  x 2 )( p 1 +  p 2 ))/(( p 1  –  p 2 )( x 1 +  x 2 )). 
(3.2) 
 The own-price elasticity is  “ elastic ” or  “ inelastic ”  depending on whether the 
elasticity of demand is less than  – 1 or greater than  – 1. The elasticity  ε i must be 
negative because  Δ x i / Δ p i is negative. If the elasticity is less than  – 1, then a 1 percent 
decrease (increase) in price leads to a more than 1 percent increase (decrease) in 
quantity demanded. Since expenditure is the product of price and quantity, if 
quantity rises by more than price falls, then expenditures rise when demand is 
elastic, and conversely for inelastic demand. 
 In assessing the elasticity of demand, it is important to consider whose 
demand one is measuring. A  person ’ s demand for a good may be inelastic but the 

86 
 Part I / Chapter 3
demand curve facing a single  firm may at the same time be highly elastic or even 
infinitely elastic. Think of the demand for gasoline. An individual ’ s demand for 
gasoline may be fairly inelastic, especially in the short run. After all, a vehicle 
consumes a certain amount of gasoline per mile. And one lives a certain distance 
from one ’ s place of employment. And there is a cost to trading in an automobile. 
For various reasons, it may pay to keep one ’ s car for a time even if the price of 
gasoline has risen considerably. While one can save some gasoline by driving at 
more constant speeds and by keeping the tires properly inflated, fundamentally it 
is hard to change the gasoline mileage on a given car. However, in the longer run, 
one can more easily trade cars and insulate houses in response to a dramatic 
increase in the price of gasoline or home heating oil. When the price of gasoline 
rises, people begin to think about trading in their  “ gas guzzlers ” for more economi-
cal cars, but actually doing this takes time. 
 Similarly, an individual ’ s demand curve for physicians ’ services may be fairly 
inelastic in the short run. When we are ill, we often seek care from our regular 
physician. There is a value to maintaining continuity of care. But in the longer run, 
if the physician raises his or her fees by a large amount, an individual, especially 
one without health insurance, may select another physician. 
 Changes in prices not only affect demand for the good or service whose price 
has changed (own-price changes), with the quantity response to such price changes 
expressed as own-price elasticities, but changes in the price of a good or service 
may also affect demand for other goods and services. Goods or services may be 
substitutes, complements, or neither substitutes nor complements. Two goods or 
services are substitutes if a fall (rise) in the price of one good or service leads to a 
fall (rise) in the quantity demanded of the other good or service. Two goods or 
services are complements if a fall (rise) in the price of one good or service leads to 
a rise (fall) in the quantity demanded of the other good or service. 
 In elasticity terms, define  ε ij = ( Δ x i / Δ p j )  × ( p j / x i ). If  ε ij is positive, good  i and 
good  j are substitutes; if  ε ij is negative, the two goods are complements; or if  ε ij is 
zero, there is no relationship in demand between the two goods, that is, demands 
for the two goods are independent. 
 Air travel and car highway travel are substitutes. The use of drugs for high 
blood pressure and inpatient hospital days for treating heart attack may be substi-
tutes. If the price of such drugs decreases and their use increases, the demand for 
hospital care may decrease. In technical terms, the cross price elasticity is negative 
in the case of complements and positive in the case of substitutes. 
 Several decades ago, economists asked whether ambulatory care, or care 
delivered in physicians ’ offices, and hospital care were substitutes or complements. 
If the two services are substitutes, offering health insurance for hospital care but 
not for physicians ’ services would decrease demand for services in physicians ’ 
offices. Conversely, if they are complements, people would not visit physicians. 
These persons would therefore not be referred to hospitals for treatment. Thus, this 

Demand for Health Care Services

imbalance in insurance coverage would cause hospital use to be lower than it 
would be if both services in physicians ’ offices and hospitals had similar rates of 
coverage. Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs typically are not covered by insurance, 
while physician visits are. People with insurance coverage for physicians ’ services 
would plausibly substitute physician visits for OTC medicines when they have a 
cold. Or would they? (See   box 3.1. )  
 3.2 
 Demand in the Context of Health Insurance 
Coverage 
 Health insurance is designed to reduce the price of health care services at the point 
of service, that is, when personal health care services are consumed. Health insur-
ance can take many forms. 
 Box 3.1 
 Are Visits to Physicians and the Use of Over-the-Counter Medications Substitutes? The Case of the 
Common Cold 
 Ii and Ohkusa (2002)  used data from a household survey from Japan to assess whether 
people with a common cold would increase their use of over-the-counter (OTC) 
medications if the coinsurance rate on spending on physicians ’ services, the fraction 
of total expenditure that insured persons must pay out of pocket, were increased by 
10 percent. In Japan, both physicians ’ services and prescribed medications but not 
OTC medications are covered by public health insurance. In Japan, physicians dis-
pense prescribed medications. 
 They found that the price elasticity of demand for medical services ranged from 
 – 0.23 to  – 0.36, which implies that a 10 percent increase in the coinsurance rate would 
decrease demand for such services from 2.3 percent to 3.6 percent. The 10 percent 
increase in the coinsurance rate would increase demand for OTC drugs to treat 
common colds, implying that physicians ’ services – prescribed medicines and OTC 
drugs are substitutes. The authors further reported that the savings in expenditures 
on physicians and prescribed drugs would be far higher than the increase in spending 
on OTC drugs. 
 Although physicians ’ services and OTC drugs are substitutes in the context of a 
common cold, whether or not two services or goods are substitutes or complements 
more generally is an empirical question. For example, one result of the RAND Health 
Insurance Experiment described below is that physicians ’ services and hospital care 
are complements. Complementarity likely arises in this latter context because it gener-
ally takes a physician ’ s referral to be admitted to a hospital. People who do not see 
physicians may be admitted to a hospital on an emergency basis, but they are much 
less likely to be admitted in nonemergency situations.

 Part I / Chapter 3
 One form is a  fixed dollar subsidy . The insurance policy specifies a fixed 
dollar amount that the insurer will pay for a particular type of service. This form 
of subsidy is often called an  “ indemnity ”  in the insurance industry. The insurance 
policy might pay $ I  for an office visit and $ I  for a particular kind of surgery. In 
 figure 3.1 , where the indemnity is set at $ I , the effect of introducing coverage paying 
$ I per unit of service is to cause a parallel shift in the demand curve by the amount 
$ I . The shift is parallel and outward (to the right) for this reason. If a patient were 
willing to pay $3 for a unit of service without insurance, with insurance offering 
an indemnity of $ I , the same individual is now willing to pay $3 + $ I since the 
insured person is assured that he or she will be paid $ I back after the insurer 
receives documentation that the services were rendered. If the willingness to pay 
is $9 for a unit without insurance, the same individual is now willing to pay $9 + 
$ I , and so on. The basic underlying willingness to pay out of the consumer ’ s own 
pocket has not changed.  
 Although, as seen below, indemnities have certain advantages, they suffer 
from one major disadvantage from the vantage point of the individual with such 
insurance coverage. The amount of the subsidy does not change as the price of the 
service changes. Thus, if one obtains care from a high-priced doctor as opposed to 
a lower-priced one, the subsidy is the same. This places individuals with such 
health insurance coverage at substantial risk of high out-of-pocket expenditures in 
the event of an illness, particularly a serious one, for which a high-priced doctor,

such as a leading specialist in a medical field, may be more productive than a 
lower-quality one. 
 On the other hand, while indemnities rank poorly in terms of expenditure 
risk protection (i.e., poor in terms of protecting ill persons ’ income net of spending 
on the personal health care services they receive), indemnities have an economic-
efficiency-enhancing aspect. This form of subsidy produces less of a distortion in 
demand than do other types of subsidies. Suppose that high- and low-priced physi-
cians are of equal quality. Then efficiency would dictate a consumer choice of the 
lower-priced physician. But complete health insurance insulates consumers from 
the price difference. However, with a fixed dollar subsidy, the difference in price 
accrues to the consumer, thus giving the consumer an incentive to search out the 
lower-priced physician. 
 An alternative to a fixed dollar subsidy is an  ad valorem subsidy . The term 
 ad valorem  comes from the Latin and means  “ according to the value. ” An ad 
valorem subsidy increases with increases in the price of the subsidized good or 
service. A simple insurance contract employing an ad valorem subsidy would pay 
a specific percentage of the price, say, 80 percent. In this case, the insurance policy 
pays 80 percent and the insured individual pays 20 percent of the charge. Ad 
valorem subsidies cause the postinsurance demand curve to rotate around the point 
at which the demand curve touches the  x - or quantity axis (  fig. 3.2 ).

 We leave it as an exercise for you to demonstrate why this is so. The fraction 
of the bill that the patient pays is called  coinsurance . In the 80/20 case, 0.2 is the 
coinsurance rate. Coinsurance is much less commonly used at present than in the 
past. In   figure 3.2 , demand curve  A is the consumer ’ s demand curve without health 
insurance and demand curve  B is the demand curve with a coinsurance rate of 
about 0.5. Demand curve  C shows the demand of a consumer with insurance that 
pays the entire bill — that is, the coinsurance rate is zero ( “ free ” care).  
 Many insurance contracts contain  deductibles or minimum amounts of 
expenditure that the insured person must bear before the insurer subsidizes care. 
There are two main justifications for deductibles. First, having a deductible means 
that the insurer will not pay for many services the individual with such insurance 
receives. There is a savings in administrative expense to the insurer by having to 
write fewer checks. Another reason is that over the range covered by the deduct-
ible, insurance will not affect demand for care (  fig. 3.3 ).

 Let the deductible in   figure 3.3  be the rectangle  ABC 0. The deductible is 
shown as the shaded area of a rectangle. With a deductible of this amount and a 
price of  p , the healthy ( h ) consumer will consume  0xh  , the same amount he or 
she would consume without insurance. However, with this deductible, consumers 
in medium ( m ) health and those who are sick ( s ) will consume  0
1
xm  and  0xs , 
respectively. At the margin, individuals in the latter two groups face a zero price 
of care. 
 We consider the effects of a higher deductible below. However, if the 
deductible is increased to  AHI 0, then the person in medium health consumes  0
2
xm  
units of medical services. The quantity demanded by the other two groups is 
unchanged. 
 Still another feature of insurance contracts is the  co-pay . In contrast to deduct-
ibles, which apply to total expenditures on health services, a co-pay is imposed 
for each unit of service. In a sense, it is the opposite of an indemnity. A co-pay is 
a deductible per unit of service, in contrast to the usual meaning of a deductible, 
which applies to a certain amount of expenditure that must be incurred by the 
insured individual before coverage applies. 
 In   figure 3.4 , the insured individual pays $ y per unit of service while the 
insurer pays the rest. For example, the insurance contract may specify that the 
insured person must pay $ y for each monthly prescription, with the insurer paying 
the rest. In this case, insurance has no effect on the demand curve up to the amount 
of the co-pay. Thereafter, if insurance pays the rest, the person will be indifferent 
whether the price of the drug charged the insurance plan is slightly above or much 
above the co-pay (  fig. 3.4 ). Thus, the demand curve is completely inelastic above 
the co-pay amount (pivots at  B ).  
 Table 3.1  provides a summary of alternative forms of health insurance and 
their impacts on demand curves for personal health care services. In practice, 
an insurance policy can be a mix of different forms of health insurance. For 
example, in the past, a typical health insurance policy in the United States was a 
policy with deductible plus coinsurance for the expenditure above the threshold 
of the deductible amount. More recently, co-pays have become more common, with 
correspondingly greater reliance on managed care to control use of services (see 
chapter 11). 
 The cost-sharing provisions of the health insurance plans Duke University 
offered its employees in a recent year, an example of health insurance plans pro-
vided by large employers in the United States, are described in   box 3.2 . The features 
of Duke University ’ s plans are illustrative. There is variation among health plans 
provided by US employers. The major provisions of Medicare, public health insur-
ance for the elderly, disabled, and persons with end-stage kidney disease in the 
United States, and Taiwan ’ s public single-payer insurance plan are described in 
 boxes 3.3 and 3.4 , respectively.

 Cost Sharing and Benefit Structure of Duke University Health Plans in 2009 
 The Duke University Health System is a large private US employer. As of 2009, it 
employed about 25,000 persons. Although private employers differ in their offerings, 
Duke provides an example of the type of health plan coverage offered by large employ-
ers in the United States. The offering is more generous than would typically be the 
case for small US employers. 
 For 2010, Duke offered employees an alternative of coverage under four health 
plans — three health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and a preferred provider 
organization (PPO). The HMOs provided coverage only if the insured individual 
obtained care from a provider within the plan ’ s network of providers. The PPO, by 
contrast, covered care from providers within and without the plan ’ s provider network. 
However, in a PPO, if care is obtained outside the network, the insured ’ s out-of-pocket 
payment is higher. The HMOs differed in whether they subjected the enrollee to an 
annual deductible or not. The HMO with the lower out-of-pocket premium ( “ basic 
HMO ” ) had a $500 deductible per person and a $1,500 deductible per family. When 
the Duke employee had family coverage, the operative deductible was the one that 
was satisfied first. The basic HMO and the PPO had coinsurance rates, but the coin-
surance amount was subject to a maximum stop loss. The other HMOs did not impose 
coinsurance. Plans had co-pays, which varied per unit of service. For example, 
co-pays for a visit to a primary care physician varied from $15 to $20. Those for 
specialist visits varied from $45 to $60 per visit. All plans covered a large number of 
types of service, including visits to physicians, various diagnostic tests, inpatient care, 
and ambulatory hospital care. There was a co-pay for a hospital admission that ranged 
from $450 to $700, depending on the plan. Pharmaceuticals were covered, but with 
substantial cost sharing unless the mail-order program was used. The maximum 
lifetime payment was $2 million for each plan. The monthly premium for an indi-
vidual plan, which the employee paid through payroll deduction, ranged from $23 
to $99 per month. The corresponding premiums for family coverage ranged from $225 
to $444 per month. In addition, the employer made monthly contributions to 
premiums.

 Cost Sharing and Benefit Structure of US Medicare 
 US Medicare covers persons over age 65, those with end-stage kidney disease, and 
persons whom Medicare accepts as disabled. It consists of four parts: hospital insur-
ance — Part A, which covers inpatient care in hospitals, skilled nursing facility care, 
hospice care, and home health care; medical insurance — Part B, which covers physi-
cians ’ services and outpatient care and some preventive care services; Advantage 
Plans — Part C, which provide health care coverage by health maintenance

 Cost Sharing and Benefit Structure of Taiwan ’ s Universal Health Insurance Plan 
Box 3.3
(continued)
 The universal health insurance program in Taiwan, termed NHI, for national health 
insurance, is financed by payroll taxes, with large government subsidies from general 
revenue. The NHI provides comprehensive coverage, including outpatient visits for 
Chinese and Western medicine, dental services, hospital stays, emergency services, 
prescription drugs, and rehabilitation services. 
 To deal with moral hazard, NHI has implemented demand-side cost sharing for 
outpatient visits, hospital inpatient care, and prescription drugs. For outpatient visits, 
the fixed co-pay per visit in 2009 ranged from New Taiwan dollars NT$50 to NT$360 
(in December 2008, the exchange rate was NT$32.85 to US$1), depending on the type 
organizations (HMOs) or preferred provider organizations (PPOs) as alternatives to 
conventional fee-for-service Parts A, B, and D; and prescription drug coverage — Part 
D, which provides coverage for prescription drugs. 
 Part A is provided at no out-of-pocket cost to persons who qualify for Medicare. 
Part A covers the entire cost of inpatient stays above a deductible. Skilled nursing 
facility care is provided for up to 100 days following a three-day minimum stay in 
an inpatient hospital. 
 Part B charged a monthly premium of $96.40 in 2009; individuals with an adjusted 
gross income of more than $85,000 or married persons with adjusted gross incomes 
of more than $170,000 paid higher monthly premiums than this. Part B also imposed 
an annual deductible. Medicare imposed a 20 percent coinsurance on Medicare-
approved Part B expenses above the deductible. Patient cost sharing was often paid 
by private Medicare supplemental insurance plans (Medigap plans). 
 Medicare Advantage Plans were required to at least cover all types of services 
covered by Parts A and B. Such plans may offer additional coverage, such as for 
vision, hearing, dental, or health and wellness programs, as well as prescription 
drugs. Some Medicare Advantage Plans have provider networks, which restricts the 
beneficiary ’ s choice of provider. Each plan could charge different out-of-pocket costs, 
usually co-payments, but also coinsurance and deductibles. Out-of-pocket premiums 
vary by plan. 
 Unless obtained through an Advantage Plan, Medicare coverage for prescription 
drugs could be obtained through Part D. Such plans assess a monthly premium. 
Enrolled persons pay an annual deductible, co-payments, and coinsurance. Most 
Medicare drug plans have a coverage gap (termed the  “ donut hole ” ). After the benefi-
ciary has spent a certain amount on Medicare-covered prescription drugs, he or she 
must pay all medication costs out of pocket up to a limit. Coverage for drug expen-
ditures begins above this limit.

 The Concept of Time Price 
 Up to now, we have not taken account of the fact that the out-of-pocket price one 
pays for care is not the only price the consumer of personal health care services 
faces. To visit a physician, one has to take time from one ’ s usual pursuits to travel 
to the physician ’ s office or clinic, then wait for the physician in the waiting room 
and spend time in an examining room, only to repeat the travel time on the way 
home. Further, there are the out-of-pocket expenses of gasoline, tolls, transit fare, 
and other expenses. In many cases, a parent, spouse, or caregiver accompanies the 
patient, which may add an appreciable amount to the full price of a visit to a phy-
sician. We limit the analysis to money and time cost of the physician visit here to 
simplify the discussion. 
 Consider the  full price  of an office visit,  p f : 
 p f =  cp +  wt , 
(3.3) 
 where  c = coinsurance rate,  p = the physician ’ s fee,  w = the value of the person ’ s 
(patient ’ s) time per unit of time, and  t = total patient time consumed by a visit. The 
variable  w is the value of the person ’ s time spent doing other activities, for example 
forgone earnings or the value of time spent in parenting. For some individuals, 
especially those with an insurance policy with a low  c ,  wt  could be a more impor-
tant determinant of the full price than  p is. 
 The concept of time prices offers a useful framework for explaining several 
stylized facts observed in countries throughout the world. First, in many countries, 
 “ free ” care is provided in public clinics. The term  “ free ” is placed in quotation 
Box 3.4
(continued)
of provider and the accreditation level of the hospital. The coinsurance rate for hos-
pital inpatient services was 10 percent for stays under 30 days. There was no drug 
co-pay if the drug expenditure per visit was under NT$100. The drug co-pay was 
NT$20 when the drug expenditure per visit ranged from NT$100 to NT$200. The 
co-pay increased by NT$20 for each NT$100 increase in the amount of expenditure 
on drugs per visit. The maximum co-pay was NT$200. Overall, co-pays for prescrip-
tion drugs were low, ranging from NT$20 to $200, depending on the amount of drug 
expenditures per outpatient visit. 
 To protect households from high out-of-pocket expenditures, there was an out-of-
pocket expenditure ceiling for hospital inpatient services; the ceiling was NT$19,000 
per admission and NT$31,000 per year. In addition, there was a co-payment exemp-
tion for specific groups of persons, including persons with payer-defined catastrophic 
illness, low-income persons, veterans, and persons living in remote areas.

marks because typically patients have long waiting times in such facilities, some-
times much longer waits than in private physicians ’ offices. Patients differ in their 
 w ’ s and hence in the importance of  wt  as a fraction of  p f . For this reason, one would 
expect sorting, with people with a low  w selecting sources of care with a higher  t , 
such as care at public outpatient clinics, and persons with a higher  w selecting 
sources of care with a low  t even if the  p is higher, such as care at private physi-
cians ’  offices. 
 Second, as  c is reduced, all persons have an incentive to select care with low 
 t ’ s. At the limit, where  c = 0, people will not be concerned about fees at all. They 
will select sources of care with the lowest  wt , care sites near their homes or work-
places and those with low waiting times. The demand for free public clinics may 
 Box 3.5 
 Time Prices and Demand for Care 
 Time consumed in the receipt of personal health services takes several forms: travel 
time, time spent waiting at the physician ’ s office, time spent during the visit, and 
time spent on visit follow-up, such as time devoted to purchasing drugs prescribed 
during the visit. A barrier to the use of care, especially in lower-income countries, is 
distance to the provider. Greater distance imposes costs on users, in the form of both 
the time spent in travel per se and the out-of-pocket costs incurred in paying for 
transport. 
 A few empirical studies have investigated the role of distance from providers. A 
study of demand for medical care in rural Kenya ( Mwabu, Ainsworth, and Nyamete 
1993 ) reported that both distance from health care facilities and user fees were more 
of a deterrent to the use of care for women than for men. Elasticities of use with 
respect to distance were between  – 0.1 and  – 0.3. 
 A study of choice of health care provider in Nigeria ( Ichoku and Leibbrandt 2003 ) 
found that given the decision to visit a health care provider, the probability of visiting 
a particular facility decreased by about 0.1 for each additional kilometer that the 
person lived from that facility. The same study found that waiting time in the clinic 
did not have a statistically significant effect on choice of that facility. An earlier study 
of demand for health care in Nigeria ( Akin, Guilkey, and Denton 1995 ) found that the 
longer it took to travel to a facility, the more likely the individual was to select that 
facility for care. The authors cautioned that this time cost variable was obviously 
proxying for something other than time cost, or some other factor may have explained 
this implausible finding. 
 In a study of the utilization of public health centers in Portugal ( Lourenco and 
Ferreira 2005 ), the researchers failed to find a relationship between total time spent 
at the center and demand for care at the center. However, total time reflects time spent 
with health care providers in part, and such time may be considered to be a  “ good, ” 
in contrast to other forms of time cost, which plausibly are  “ bads. ” 

Demand for Health Care Services

be expected to fall. Thus, the public provision of complete insurance ( c = 0 or 
nearly 0) should lead to a decline in the number of free public clinics. 
 Third, reductions in  c will reduce the elasticity of demand with respect to 
fees (money prices). At  c = 0, this elasticity will be zero.   Box 3.5  describes some 
empirical evidence on the impact of time prices on demand for personal health 
care services.  
 3.4 
 Empirical Studies of Demand 
 Data Used in Demand Studies 
 Observational Data 
 Many empirical studies of demand for personal health care services have been 
conducted since about 1970. While economists have emphasized the roles of price 
and income as determinants of demand, many other studies have focused on other 
demand determinants, including psychological, sociological, and cultural factors, 
as well as public policies that may affect the utilization of and expenditures on 
care. A later section in this chapter provides a brief review of the evidence on 
demand determinants other than price and income, but as a text on health econom-
ics, our emphasis is on the roles of prices and income. 
 The vast majority of studies are based on  observational   data . These data are 
not obtained from randomized controlled trials, to be described later. They are 
called observational because persons are not randomly assigned to treatment and 
control groups. Rather, data on individuals ’ characteristics and activities are simply 
recorded as reported to interviewers or as written in clinic (medical) records or 
administrative records. 
 Surveys record many characteristics of the respondent and may include ques-
tions on the respondent ’ s health insurance and income. Clinic records are likely 
to have medical information that cannot easily be obtained from household surveys. 
Yet the number of clinics from which the samples are drawn is often small (fre-
quently only one clinic), and there is a risk that evidence from a clinic or a few 
clinics may not generalize to individuals selected from a larger pool. Administra-
tive data often come from public or private insurers in the form of claims data. 
Claims data often have detailed information on patient diagnoses and the proce-
dures performed. And claims databases can be quite large in terms of the number 
of individuals included. However, they may lack information on characteristics of 
the individual that are often obtainable from household surveys. 
 Although the pros and cons of various types of observational data differ, they 
share one common disadvantage for analysis of the effects of price on the utiliza-
tion of and expenditures on personal health care services. People who expect to 

98 
 Part I / Chapter 3
use more health services in the future may select health plans offering more gener-
ous insurance coverage than persons who do not expect high rates of use in the 
future. Or if there is no law compelling individuals to have health insurance cover-
age or it is not provided by the government, young, healthy persons may decide to 
forgo health insurance altogether. The phenomenon of basing one ’ s choice of insur-
ance on one ’ s expected future use of covered services is called  adverse selection 
(see chapter 1). 
 Adverse selection is not unique to insurance. Suppose that one wanted to 
compare the effectiveness of drug A with that of drug B in the treatment of a spe-
cific disease. If the researcher used observational data, she would assemble infor-
mation on persons with the disease who used drug A or drug B, perhaps from clinic 
and insurance files. The researcher would compare the health outcomes of persons 
taking drug A versus drug B. A serious methodological deficiency of this approach 
is that doctors are likely to prescribe drug A for those patients for whom drug A 
is more appropriate, and similarly for drug B. Thus, a comparison of drugs A and 
B would reflect not only the relative effectiveness of the drugs but also character-
istics of the patients treated with each of the drugs. For example, if drug A has 
more undesirable side effects but is truly more effective, the drug might be con-
sumed disproportionately by patients with more serious forms of the disease. 
Because these patients are sicker, they will have poorer health outcomes with or 
without use of the drug than will users of drug B. If patient health could be mea-
sured fully and accurately, there would be no adverse selection problem. However, 
in practice, full and accurate measurement generally is not possible. 
 Randomized Controlled Trials 
 For this reason, regulatory authorities require that studies of drug effectiveness and 
safety be based on information obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
rather than on observational data. The latter type of data is used for postmarketing 
surveillance, for example, to document adverse side effects from the drug after it 
has been widely marketed. RCTs are conducted over a shorter time period and on 
much smaller samples than become available after a drug has been marketed glob-
ally and for several years. 
 In an RCT, a drug company or medical device manufacturer (e.g., a manufac-
turer of artificial joints or of cardiac pacemakers), desiring to gain regulatory 
approval to market a new drug or medical device, advertises for volunteers among 
persons with the disease treated by the drug. Volunteers are then randomly assigned 
to one of the study drug treatments. In the best of these studies, double-blind 
experiments, neither the patient nor the physician knows to which drug group the 
patient has been randomly assigned. Random assignment, particularly with double 
blinding, eliminates the effect of physician decision making about the choice of 
drug that is likely to be systematically related to patient health in ways that the 
physicians but not the researcher can observe. Once the influence of drug selection 

Demand for Health Care Services 
 99
related to patient health factors not observable to the researcher has been elimi-
nated, the observed differences in outcome can be attributed to the effects of the 
drug itself. 
 RCTs are very common in studies of drug outcomes but are extremely rare in 
social science research. One reason is that RCTs are expensive in general and in 
the social sciences tend to be even more expensive than in medical research. 
Second, double blinding is not possible in social science research. When a double-
blind protocol is used in a drug RCT, not only does the patient not know whether 
he or she is in the treatment or control group, the physician prescribing the drug 
does not know this either. 
 While people can be randomly assigned to insurance plans, there is no way 
of concealing the plan to which people are assigned. One cannot coat a health 
insurance plan in the same way one can coat a pill (to disguise the fact that the 
pill contains an inert substance or is a generic drug already on the market) used 
in the control group to make it look identical to a pill being evaluated by the RCT. 
 But in spite of these disadvantages, an RCT to measure the effects of insur-
ance has the advantage of avoiding the adverse selection problem described above. 
A study participant has the option of not participating in the RCT at all, but, given 
participation, the person has no choice of insurance plan. Of course, a participant 
cannot be forced to stay in the RCT. Attrition is a problem in RCTs of all types for 
this reason, and social experiments are no exception ( Philipson and Hedges 1998 ). 
Because RCTs are so expensive and eliciting participation and attrition are likely 
to be more consequential in studies of longer duration, RCTs are generally con-
ducted for only a short time period. The RCT described in the next section, which 
lasted for three to five years, is on the lengthy side among RCTs. Also, given the 
expense of administering RCTs, sample sizes are kept at a level likely to allow 
statistically significant findings but may not be sufficiently large to detect rare 
outcomes, such as from a drug. Also, the sample sizes may be insufficient to yield 
reliable estimates for population subgroups, such as racial or ethnic minorities or 
elderly persons. 
 Natural Experiments 
 There is another type of experiment that is much less costly than most RCTs. This 
is a  natural experiment . These experiments take advantage of a change in the fea-
tures of a health insurance plan. For example, in the 1990s, government health 
authorities in Belgium increased co-payment rates for three types of physicians ’ 
services — office visits to general practitioners (GPs), home visits by GPs, and visits 
to specialist physicians ( Cockx and Brasseur 2003 ). Since the insurance was not 
voluntarily purchased but provided by the government, the change was totally 
outside the individual person ’ s or the person ’ s physician ’ s control. 
 The change was  exogenous to the persons affected by the change. Thus, any 
change in use could be attributed to the change in co-payments, with one proviso. 

100 
 Part I / Chapter 3
Some other factor, say a recession or a natural disaster, could have affected 
use of services, and this other factor might have coincided with the change in 
the co-payment. For this reason, the authors used a control group that consisted 
of Belgians for whom the co-payment did not change. The latter group would 
have also been affected by these other factors but not by the change in 
co-payments. 
 The researchers computed the mean difference in quantity post versus pre 
for persons in the treatment group  T ( Δ x iT ), minus the mean difference in quantity 
for the same post period for the control group  C ( Δ x iC ). The change in price for the 
treatment group was  Δ cp jT . For the control group,  Δ cp jC was zero since the change 
in the co-payment did not apply to these individuals. The difference in difference 
between treatment and control groups is called a difference-in-difference 
estimator. 
 Using this approach,  Cockx and Brasseur (2003)  found price elasticities of 
 – 0.13 for men and  – 0.03 for women. These price elasticities are low, but not atypi-
cal for price elasticities of demand for personal health care services. The  – 0.13 
elasticity for men implies that a 1 percent increase in price would reduce the 
quantity of services demanded by 0.13 percent. 
 A prior study for the same country by  van de Voorde, van Doorslaer, and 
Schokkaert (2001 ) but using a longer time period and a different methodology 
found price elasticities of demand for GP office visits in the  – 0.16 to  – 0.12 range. 
Elasticities for GP home visits ranged from  – 0.39 to  – 0.28 and for visits to special-
ists were  – 0.10. 
 The RAND Health Insurance Experiment 
 The Research Issues 
 Many studies of demand for personal health care services have been conducted 
using observational data. However, one RCT of effects of insurance coverage on 
demand for personal health services, though now about three decades old, even 
today, is the most widely cited study of demand for personal health services by 
far. This RCT study is called the Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) and was con-
ducted by economists, physicians, and others at the RAND Corporation during the 
1970s. We continue to discuss the study more than three decades after it was com-
pleted because the HIE remains the classic study of demand for personal health 
care services. 
 The HIE addressed these specific research issues. First, how does cost sharing 
affect demand for personal health services? Is the demand response to increased 
cost sharing different for poor than for non-poor persons? One might expect poor 
individuals to be more responsive to changes in the out-of-pocket (money) price 
than non-poor individuals. One reason is that the money price is a higher propor-
tion of the full price of a unit of services for poor than for non-poor individuals. 

Demand for Health Care Services 
 101
For this reason, increasing cost sharing would have a greater impact on consump-
tion of services by the poor. 
 Second, how does cost sharing affect demand for particular services (e.g., 
hospital, mental, and dental services)? One might expect that cost sharing would 
have a greater impact on demand for services that people regard as discretionary 
or that can easily be postponed, such as physical examinations, than on demand 
for emergency care, such as to fix a broken bone. 
 Third, does consumption of personal health care services improve personal 
health? The presumption for many decades was that receipt of more medical care 
leads to better health, but this proposition has been increasingly questioned in the 
last three decades or so. In particular, some medical care may be highly productive, 
but other types may not be. Or some people may be consuming care at a margin (a 
considerable amount of care) at which additional units of care are no longer pro-
ductive in terms of improving health. The HIE began a very active line of research, 
called  health outcomes research , which has involved evaluation of various preven-
tive, diagnostic, and therapeutic services using observational data. 
 Fourth, does insurance paid on a capitation basis result in lower health care 
expenditures than insurance that pays on a fee-for-service basis? Under pure capita-
tion, health insurance plans pay health care providers a fixed amount per person 
per year, and for this premium, the insured person is entitled to all care deemed 
medically necessary at zero or a very low out-of-pocket price to the policyholders. 
The provision of additional services does not result in additional payment to health 
care providers as it does under fee-for-service arrangements. In fact, the provider 
incurs additional cost per additional unit of service and no additional revenue. 
Since the marginal cost of providing an additional service is positive — that is, time 
and other inputs, such as medical supplies, are consumed in supplying additional 
units of service — providers lose money when they supply additional services. For 
this reason, providers may ration care. By rationing, we mean supplying fewer 
services than the consumer demands at a given price. A plausible hypothesis is 
that the utilization of personal health care services is lower when people are 
covered by capitated insurance plans than under insurance that pays providers on 
a fee-for-service basis. 
 HIE Study Design 
 The HIE enrolled about 2,000 nonelderly families from six different areas in the 
United States for a period of three to five years ( Newhouse and the Insurance 
Experiment Group 1993 ). Persons older than age 62 were excluded. Families were 
randomly assigned to one of fourteen fee-for-service insurance plans differing in 
(1) coinsurance or cost-sharing rates and (2) maximum expenditures (MDE). An 
MDE is a limit on total out-of-pocket expenditures for medical services incurred 
in a year, often called a  stop loss . If, for example, the stop loss is $1,000, this means 
that insured individuals can expect to pay no more than $1,000 per year out of 

102 
 Part I / Chapter 3
pocket. Every dollar of expenditure above the stop loss is fully covered by the 
insurance plan. The difference between gross and net (i.e., out-of-pocket) expen-
diture rises with increases in the coinsurance rate. If the coinsurance rate is 0, the 
difference is $1,000. If, however, the coinsurance rate is 0.25, the difference is 
$4,000, which means that the insured individual is subject to some cost sharing 
until gross expenditure reaches a $4,000 threshold. 
 At the time of enrollment in the HIE, families exchanged their own health 
insurance policies for an HIE policy. The match between study participants and 
their existing insurance policies and the HIE policies they received in return was 
random. 
 Participation in RCTs is not random, however. As in all RCTs, individuals ’ 
participation in the HIE was entirely voluntary. To induce people to participate, 
participants in the HIE received sufficient compensation up front so that they could 
not be financially worse off than with their existing policy even if they reached 
the maximum out-of-pocket level of expenditures (hold harmless clause). One of 
the HIE plans covered all care for free, that is, at no cost to the family. At the other 
extreme, people paid 95 percent of expenses out of pocket up to the stop loss, 
which was set at 10 percent of the family ’ s income. 
 Thus, under the latter HIE plan, if the person was a member of a household 
with $20,000 in annual income, the stop loss would have been $2,000 per year. 
The person would pay 95 percent of the medical expenditures until the gross 
expenditure (expenditure before insurance was paid) reached $2,105.26 per year. 
Additional expenditure was covered in full. The HIE included this plan type to 
measure the effect of only providing insurance coverage for large expenditures on 
demand for care. 
 There were also intermediate levels of cost sharing, 25 percent and 50 percent. 
There was also an individual deductible plan, which imposed an up-front deduct-
ible for $150 for outpatient care but provided complete coverage for hospital inpa-
tient care. The purpose of the individual deductible plan was to gauge whether 
inpatient and outpatient (ambulatory) care are substitutes or complements. If com-
pared to the free care plan, hospital utilization was lower under the individual 
deductible plan, this would indicate that ambulatory and inpatient care are com-
plements. Conversely, if hospital utilization was higher under this plan, this would 
suggest that the types of care are substitutes. 
 In addition, some persons were randomly assigned to a single capitation plan 
in Seattle, Washington. Since out-of-pocket payments incurred by families were 
negligible under this plan, a comparison of use in the free plan versus the capita-
tion plan provided evidence on the effects of capitation on demand for care. 
 HIE Results 
 Table 3.2  summarizes estimates of the impact of cost sharing on use of hospital 
inpatient and ambulatory care. Ambulatory care is care provided to persons that 

Demand for Health Care Services 
 103
does not involve an overnight stay in a hospital or other health care facility. 
Increased cost sharing caused families to use less care. The likelihood or probabil-
ity of use of any service during the year varied from 86.8 percent for families 
assigned to the free plan to 67.7 percent for persons assigned to the 95 percent 
plan. 
 Considering these four plans, total expenditures (paid by the families and the 
insurance plan to which they were assigned) per enrollee on care varied from $982 
to $679 per year (nominal US dollars).  1 Comparing the individual deductible plan 
with the free plan, both of which offered free hospital care, rates of at least one 
admission per year were 9.6 percent for enrolled families with the individual 
deductible and 10.3 percent for those on the free plan. Also, outpatient expendi-
tures and the number of face-to-face visits per year were lower for enrolled families 
with the individual deductible than for those on the free plan. Thus, imposing a 
deductible on outpatient care resulted in lower use of both outpatient and inpatient 
care, implying that outpatient and inpatient care are complements, not 
substitutes.  
 While conducting an RCT trial in the social sciences, though not unique to 
the HIE, is highly unusual, another innovation was to measure the impact of cost 
sharing on health. As just seen, imposing a cost-sharing provision reduced the use 
of services. But does the lower rates of use result in people becoming less healthy? 
 Results from the HIE imply that for the vast majority of persons, the 94 
percent of persons who did not have low income and were not in poor health, there 
was little or no measurable effect on health outcomes for any of the cost-sharing 
plans compared to free care, with a couple of exceptions.

 Part I / Chapter 3
 Persons covered by the free care plan were more likely to keep their eyeglass 
prescriptions up to date and to have somewhat better oral health. For a subgroup 
of low-income persons initially in poor health, especially those with high blood 
pressure, imposing cost sharing did adversely affect health. This result implies that 
providing free care for particular services and subpopulations may be desirable, 
but that providing free care to everyone does not result in a measurable improve-
ment in health for the population as a whole. 
 The result is highly provocative, especially since countries around the world 
are allocating ever larger shares of their national product to personal health care 
services. While the HIE finding on health outcomes is correct given the study 
design, some design elements may be responsible for this result. For one, persons 
older than 62 were not included in the HIE study. Health tends to depreciate at an 
increasing rate during the sixties and later in the life course. Second, a three- to 
five-year follow-up period, understandable since the HIE was so expensive to 
conduct, may have been insufficiently long to allow the HIE researchers to docu-
ment a relationship between health services use and health. The HIE researchers 
hypothesized that discretionary health care services may be more price-elastic than 
nondiscretionary services. The HIE examined the impact of cost sharing versus free 
care on overall visits to emergency rooms, and emergency room visits by diagnosis. 
The diagnoses were categorized as more urgent and less urgent by a panel of emer-
gency room physicians (  table 3.3 ).  
 If we focus now on the category  “ visits with any of the above diagnoses ” for 
 “ more urgent ” versus  “ less urgent ” diagnoses, there was a 23 percent difference in 
emergency room visits per 10,000 persons for the more urgent diagnoses between 
the plans that imposed some cost sharing and the free plan, with those with cost 
sharing having a lower rate of emergency room visits. By contrast, for less urgent 
diagnoses, the difference was 47 percent. These results imply that (1) imposing 
cost sharing leads to lower utilization of the emergency room and (2) the reduction 
is greater for less urgent — presumably more discretionary — diagnoses than for more 
urgent diagnoses. In a few cases (chest pain/acute heart disease, surgical abdominal 
disease, head injury, and acute alcohol/drug reaction), the cost-sharing group had 
higher utilization. These diagnoses in particular may require care as soon as it can 
be obtained, and thus demand may be particularly nonresponsive to cost sharing 
for these diagnoses. Also, for some of the individual diagnoses, the sample sizes 
were undoubtedly quite small, and thus mean rates of use were highly subject to 
random variation. That cost sharing provided a greater deterrent to more discretion-
ary use of emergency rooms than to less discretionary uses is a finding favorable 
to requiring cost sharing in health insurance plans. 
 Physician researchers on the HIE team classified health conditions into one 
of four categories based on their judgments about the effectiveness of personal 
health care services in improving the health of persons with the conditions. The 
categories were (1) highly effective, (2) quite effective, (3) less effective, and (4)

rarely effective, as well as a fifth category, rarely effective, but self-care by the 
patient is effective (  table 3.4 ).  
 “ Effectiveness ” in relation to medical care is a complex concept. A person 
may visit a physician with a common cold or the flu, for example, to obtain reas-
surance that the cold is nothing worse or to obtain immediate symptomatic relief, 
even though in time the cold or the flu would run its course without the visit. For 
adults, cost sharing has the most effect on the use of highly effective acute care 
services and the least effect on the use of highly effective chronic care services. 
The use of rarely effective care services is decreased by cost sharing at almost the 
same rate as is the use of highly effective acute care services. For children, the 
largest decrease in use as a result of cost sharing is for highly effective chronic care 
services and the smallest decrease is for the use of acute and acute chronic highly 
effective care services. These results imply that rather than cost sharing eliminating 
ineffective services, there is a mixed pattern — both effective and ineffective ser-
vices are eliminated by cost sharing. But in the end, as noted above, imposing cost 
sharing did not have a negative effect on overall health for the vast majority of 
persons enrolled in the HIE. 
 A substantial proportion of dental care services can be postponed and are 
elective. For example, a middle-aged person perhaps could use a new crown on a 
tooth. But replacing the existing crown can wait, and perhaps the existing one is 
satisfactory, if not as good as it once was. Although routine cleaning is probably 
good for preventing major dental problems, it is often easy for people to postpone 
such preventive care. These examples are different from obtaining medical care for

a serious acute illness, such as pneumonia, or postponing surgery for a cancer a 
doctor just discovered. 
 The HIE covered dental expenditures with the same types of plans offered by 
hospital inpatient and ambulatory medical services. The results for dental visits 
and expenditures revealed a much greater response in the first year than in 
the second year of the experiment (  table 3.5 ). Not shown in the table is the 
greater response to cost sharing in the final year of the HIE than in the next to final 
year.  
 Why the utilization and expenditure response would be greater in both the 
first and the last year than in the intervening years is readily explained. We return 
to the example of the crown and the middle-aged person. The dentist had been 
telling the person for a while that he ought to get his crown replaced, but the den-
tist ’ s fee for the replacement was a deterrent since the man did not have insurance 
coverage for dental care. (Until about the 1990s, having insurance coverage for 
hospital and ambulatory medical care was much more common than was coverage 
for dental services.) Now that the man is enrolled in an HIE dental plan with not 
much cost sharing, he decides it is time to listen to his dentist and replace the 
crown. In the last year of the HIE, he realizes he will soon be without coverage. So 
he decides to have all the dental care he is likely to need in the future done in the 
final year of the HIE. 
 Table 3.5  shows that the probability of any use of the dentist is not much 
different between the first and the second year of the HIE. Thus, the effect of cost 
sharing on timing of the use of services is greatest for persons who see the dentist 
at least once during the year, not on the probability of seeing a dentist one or more

times during the year. However, cost sharing in both years does affect whether or 
not people make at least one visit during the year to the dentist. 
 An implication of the findings for dental services is that cost sharing is clearly 
a deterrent to the use of such services. If the government were to offer universal 
coverage of such services, it should expect an initial surge in demand for such care. 
 Effects of Deductibles 
 Many health insurance plans are structured to have a deductible, a minimum 
amount that the insured person must spend on covered services before the insur-
ance policy pays anything. In addition to assessing the effects of coinsurance on 
demand for care, the HIE also assessed the effects of deductibles. The HIE research-
ers initially hypothesized that raising deductibles from a near zero level would 
have very little effect on demand, raising deductibles from a moderately sized 
deductible would have much larger deterrent effect on demand, and raising deduct-
ibles that were already high would have little effect on demand ( Newhouse and 
the Insurance Experiment Group 1993 , 139). 
 The reason a change from a very low deductible would have very little effect 
is that low deductibles are likely to be satisfied with virtually any use of services. 
For example, if a $5 deductible were increased to $6, this would have little effect 
if a physician visit were priced at $50. Anyone who visited the doctor only once 
would have satisfied either deductible. 
 Now suppose the deductible were set at $5,000. Then at the margins relevant 
for most people, it would be as if they had no insurance coverage at all. Raising 
the deductible to $5,010 would have no effect. However, suppose the deductible 
were $750. Then raising the deductible to, say, $775 might have an effect on 
demand for personal health care services if many persons incur annual expendi-
tures on such care in this range. 
 In fact, the HIE researchers found that both small and medium-sized deduct-
ibles affected demand. However, the effect tapered off, so that after a certain point, 
increasing the deductible did not decrease demand further.  
 Cost Sharing: Greater Effect on Demand for Low-Income Than 
High-Income Families? 
 One of the important goals of the HIE was to compare the effect of cost sharing by 
level of family income. The HIE researchers ’ expectation when designing the study 
was that cost sharing would have a greater effect on lower-income than on higher-
income households. The reasoning was that lower-income families would postpone 
or forgo care to the extent possible if they had to bear the cost themselves. On the 
other hand, more affluent families would not be as likely to postpone or forgo care. 
 However, the researchers found that cost sharing ’ s effects did not vary accord-
ing to the family ’ s place in the distribution of income (  table 3.6 ). The researchers 
divided the distribution of income into thirds (terciles) and found little variation

in price elasticities by income tercile. We leave it as an exercise to compute price 
elasticities by tercile.  
 Income Effects on Demand for Care 
 The discussion to this point has focused on the effects of changes in price to the 
patient on demand for care. Gauging the effect of family income on demand is also 
of substantial interest to health policy makers and to others. The effect of income 
on demand, as measured by the HIE, is complex. The demand for many if not most 
goods rises with income; such goods are called  “ normal goods ” for this reason. But 
in addition, persons with higher income are likely to have a higher opportunity 
cost of time. For this reason, the consumption of goods and services requiring time 
on the part of consumers, such as personal health care services, may decline with 
increases in income. Personal health services themselves differ in terms of time 
required from patients. Taking a prescription drug requires little patient time. By

contrast, spending time as a patient in a hospital can require quite a bit of patient 
and family time. More affluent families may hire a person to watch over the patient 
at the hospital, such as a nurse ’ s aide. Less affluent families may depend on a 
family member for this purpose. 
 Still another consideration is that in some countries, notably the United 
States, public insurance for persons under the age of 65 is available only to persons 
with low income and few assets. When this is so, the money price of services 
declines with income. To the extent that physicians and other health providers 
charge lower prices to low-income persons who lack health insurance (see  Kessel 
1958  for an analysis of this phenomenon in the United States in the 1950s), low-
income persons ’ demand should be expected to be higher than it would be in the 
absence of such price discrimination. 
 Income elasticities may be calculated in essentially the same way as arc price 
elasticities. The part of the formula relating to quantity remains the same. However, 
two income points replace the two price points in the arc elasticity formula 
described above. 
 Before turning to the HIE results, we need to discuss one important design 
feature of the HIE that has an important effect on income elasticities of demand in 
one important respect. The HIE set a stop loss at 10 percent of annual family 
income. At this level, a single hospitalization would be likely to trigger the stop 
loss provision. Thus, families with high expenditures on personal health care ser-
vices were likely in effect to have had full coverage for services, largely indepen-
dent of their incomes. This factor may have reduced income elasticity estimates 
derived from the HIE. 
 Table 3.6 can be used to calculate income elasticities of demand for care. 
Holding the type of plan constant, one can compute income elasticities along any 
of the rows in the table. For example, among those randomized to the free care 
plan, 82.8 percent, 87.4 percent, and 90.1 percent, respectively, on average used at 
least one unit of care during the year. However, for hospital admissions, the rela-
tionship between income and utilization is U-shaped: 10.6 percent of those in the 
lowest income tercile were admitted at least once in the year, but only 10.1 percent 
of those in the middle tercile were admitted. But among persons in the highest 
tercile of family income, 10.4 percent were admitted to hospitals at least once in 
a year. Similarly, expenditures exhibit a U-shaped pattern by income tercile, being 
highest for the lowest income tercile, lowest for the middle, and second highest 
for the highest income tercile. 
 This pattern plausibly reflects two factors. First, the HIE researchers did not 
control for factors other than family income, such as health status. It is likely that 
the health of income earners in households in the lowest tercile was poorer than 
in the other terciles. Hence, spending on health care services among families in 
the lowest tercile could have been increased relative to the other terciles as a result 
of poor health. Second, the HIE plans ’ stop loss provision was plausibly somewhat 

Demand for Health Care Services 
 111
more likely to have been applied for persons with low family income. This feature 
of the HIE reduced differences in utilization and expenditures below the differ-
ences that would have occurred if no stop loss provision had been in place. 
 The fact that the percentage of any use of personal health care services in a 
year rose by tercile reflects the fact that hospital care is much more expensive than 
physicians ’  services. Thus, the effect of the stop loss was less for physicians ’ ser-
vices than for hospital services, and variations in the any use percentages were 
driven by variations in use of physicians ’ services. 
 Effects of Capitation on Use of Services 
 While the vast majority of persons in the world with health insurance have insur-
ance that pays providers on a fee-for-service basis, some plans pay a group of 
providers a fixed amount per enrollee. 
 From the standpoint of out-of-pocket payments imposed on patients, capi-
tated plans most closely resemble a free plan. Although capitation plans often 
impose a co-payment per visit, co-payments tend to be low. After the co-payment 
is paid, insurance covers the rest. 
 While comparisons of use are available from many sources, they are based 
on observational data. One might expect that healthier persons would subject 
themselves to rationing under a capitated insurance plan since they expect to use 
few services during the year. If so, lower utilization under fee-for-service arrange-
ments than under capitation may reflect differences in the health of enrollees in 
the two types of plans rather than reflect differences in the plans ’ payment methods. 
 The HIE provides empirical evidence on the effects of capitation versus fee-
for-service plans on the use of and expenditures on personal health care services. 
The HIE randomly assigned 1,149 persons who had been enrolled in fee-for-service 
plans during the previous year to a capitated plan in Seattle in the US state of 
Washington. In addition, 733 persons who had been enrolled in the same capitated 
plan in the previous year were selected as controls. The latter were controls in the 
sense that they had selected the capitated plan on their own, presumably because 
they believed they would be better off in doing so. Thus, by comparing use and 
expenditures of the randomly assigned enrollees who selected capitation volun-
tarily, the researchers could measure whether those who selected the plan volun-
tarily had different use and expenditure patterns from those who were randomly 
assigned to the plan. Further, by comparing results between those randomly 
assigned to capitation with the results for the fee-for-service plans to which all 
enrollees were randomly assigned, the HIE researchers could estimate the differ-
ences in use and expenditures between capitated and fee-for-service insurance 
plans. 
 Utilization patterns for the capitated control group (those enrolled in the 
capitated plan before the HIE) and the capitated experimental group (those who 
were randomly assigned to capitation by the HIE) were quite similar (  table 3.7 ). 

112 
 Part I / Chapter 3
Although the percentage of enrollees using any covered services during the year 
and expenditures per year were slightly higher for the control group than for the 
experimental group, the percentage of persons in the control group admitted to a 
hospital at least once during the year was lower than for the experimental group. 
Thus, there is no evidence that healthier persons selected capitation over fee-for-
service plans as would have been the case if utilization and expenditures were 
consistently higher in the control group than in the experimental group.  
 However, many researchers and policy makers have questioned whether this 
conclusion is generalizable and holds today. The general consensus is that healthier 
persons are more likely to select capitated plans. For one, maintaining an existing 
relationship with one ’ s existing fee-for-service physician is more important if one 
is in the midst of a health crisis. Also, being able to select a physician who really 
specializes in the disease or condition you have is much more important when you 
have a serious chronic condition. 
 More striking are the differences between the capitated groups and the various 
fee-for-service groups. The estimates for the fee-for-service groups are similar to 
but not exactly the same as those reported above, for a (not important) methodologi-
cal reason. Because cost sharing is similar, the most direct comparison is between 
the capitated experimental group and the free fee-for-service plans. Expenditures 
were 28 percent lower for the experimental group than for the free fee-for-service 
plan. The difference between expenditures between the capitated control and the 
free fee-for-service groups was 23 percent. Expenditures for the two capitated 
groups were similar to those for the 95 percent fee-for-service plan. Thus, doctors 
policing utilization and with patients having no financial incentive for health care

cost control was equivalent to no policing by doctors and patients paying virtually 
all of the bill up to a stop loss. 
 There were 40 percent fewer hospital admissions and hospital days among 
persons enrolled in the two capitated groups than among persons enrolled in the 
free fee-for-service plan (  table 3.8 ). The number of face-to-face visits with physi-
cians was roughly similar among the three plans. The number of preventive visits 
per year was higher in the two capitated groups, plausibly reflecting the incentive 
that providers face under capitation to keep their enrollees healthy and thus out 
of the hospital, the most costly site of care.  
 Other Empirical Evidence on the Effect of Price on the 
Quantity Demanded 
 The use of and expenditures on prescription drugs have both been increasing. As 
a result, in the United States, private health insurance plans have implemented 
various forms of cost sharing. Using data from thirty US employers with fifty-two 
health plans,  Goldman, Joyce, Escarce, et al. (2004) found that the demand for 
prescription drugs used intermittently, such as antihistamines and some pain 
killers, was more sensitive to co-payment changes than was the demand for drugs 
used on an ongoing basis by persons with a chronic illness. Price elasticities for 
individual prescription drugs ranged from  – 0.44 to  – 0.08. 
 One approach to both cost containment and quality assurance is based on the 
use of a drug formulary. A formulary is a list of drugs, those that were covered by 
public or private insurance plans, or in the case of hospitals, drugs stocked by the 
hospital for use at the facility. Hospitals were the first to adopt formularies on 
a widespread basis. The hospital formulary stocked drugs recommended by

physicians on the medical staff. The motives were to reduce the number of types 
of drugs that the hospital held in inventory and to stock those drugs that medical 
staff members believed to be effective. 
 Some private insurance plans in the United States have implemented a three-
tier formulary to encourage physicians to prescribe less expensive drugs. The 
lowest co-pay is charged for generic drugs, that is, for chemical formulas no longer 
under patent. The middle-level co-pay is charged for branded (patented) drugs. The 
highest-level co-pay is charged for branded drugs not in the formulary. Having a 
preferred drug list, that is, drugs in the first two tiers, is potentially beneficial to 
health plans in that by concentrating its purchasing on fewer drug products, it 
gains market power to negotiate favorable prices from pharmaceutical manufactur-
ers. Yet by having drugs in the third tier, the insurer allows some insurance cover-
age for drugs that may offer some added potential benefit to some patients by being 
more effective treatment for some individuals or avoiding adverse side effects that 
some patients may have with the less expensive drugs. 
 Some studies have investigated the effects of three-tier cost sharing on demand 
for pharmaceuticals. For example,  Huskamp, Frank, McGuigan, et al. (2005)  evalu-
ated a natural experiment, which occurred when the health plan for a large US 
employer implemented a three-tier co-pay plan for its pharmaceutical benefit. The 
authors concluded that the plan increased out-of-pocket payments by the employees 
enrolled in the plan, but it also increased the plan ’ s bargaining power with pharma-
ceutical manufacturers, resulting in lower prices for drugs paid for by the plan. 
 Empirical Evidence on the Effects of Health Insurance on Demand in 
a Low-Income Country 
 In Vietnam, individuals are covered by one of three types of health insurance or 
they are not insured. The three types of insurance are (1) a compulsory plan, (2) 
voluntarily purchased health insurance, and (3) a health insurance program for the 
poor. The compulsory plan covers currently employed and retired civil servants, 
employees of state enterprises, employees of private enterprises with more than 
ten employees, employees of foreign-owned organizations, the disabled,  “ people 
of merit ” (e.g., mothers, widows, and orphans of veterans), invalids of the armed 
services, and elderly persons aged 90+. No family members are covered by the 
compulsory plan. Coinsurance varies for some high-technology diagnostic services 
from 20 percent to 50 percent. Compared to persons with no insurance, the com-
pulsory plan increased the probability of hospital admission by 117 percent 
( Sepehri, Simpson, and Sarma 2006 ). For enrollees in the voluntary plan and the 
plan for the poor, the probabilities of admission were 53 percent and 185 percent 
higher than for the uninsured, respectively. Mean lengths of stay by insurance type 
were 18 percent, 2 percent, and 39 percent higher for the compulsory, voluntary, 
and plan for the poor relative to the uninsured group, respectively. The percent 
differences are larger than anything observed for hospital utilization from the HIE.

The authors of the Vietnam study did control for other demographic and health 
factors, but the large differences suggest there may be still some other unmeasured 
differences that account for some of the differences. Bias due to omitted factors 
would not occur in an RCT such as the HIE. 
 3.5 
 Welfare Analysis 
 Economists perform welfare analysis to determine whether or not a particular 
change increases or decreases societal well-being, or  “ welfare. ”  Since a demand 
curve for a good or service reflects individuals ’ maximum willingness to pay at 
different levels of quantity, demand curves are used in welfare analysis. 
 A demand curve can be viewed from two perspectives. In one, the demand 
curve gives the quantity demanded conditional on the price of the good or service. 
From this perspective, the consumer is given a price and then responds with a 
quantity he or she is willing to purchase at that price. Then the price can be varied 
and another quantity elicited. From a second perspective, the demand curve gives 
the maximum amount the person is willing to pay per unit, conditional on purchas-
ing a specific number of units. Graphically, using the first perspective, one starts 
with a value on the  y -axis, which is then associated with a quantity on the  x -axis. 
Using the second, one starts with a quantity on the  x -axis and elicits a value from 
the consumer on the  y -axis. 
 The second perspective is used by economists in welfare analysis, a method-
ology that compares the social benefits versus the costs of a particular policy 
change. Here the change involves a change in provision of a health insurance plan, 
such as an increase in the plan ’ s deductible. 
 We start with the concept of  consumer surplus . The demand curve represents 
the maximum the individual is willing to pay for a specific quantity of the good 
or service. In   figure 3.5a , the consumer demands nine units at a $0 price. For eight 
units, she is willing to pay somewhat more per unit. At the market price of 0 A , 
she demands five units. The consumer is willing to pay most for the first unit, 
somewhat less for the second unit, and so on. At price  p , she pays an amount 
0 ABC. However, she values the five units more than 0 ABC, which is what she 
pays. The value is given by the area 0 DBC . 0 DBC is the sum of 0 ABC and the 
triangle  ADB . The triangle is called consumer surplus, which represents the value 
the consumer attaches to the purchase over the amount she actually pays, which 
is 0 ABC. The shaded rectangles give approximately actual amounts of consumer 
surplus for each unit purchased. However, it simplifies the analysis by approximat-
ing this series of rectangles by a triangle.  
 Now suppose that the price per unit falls from  p to zero. Then the consumer 
will purchase units until the value of the marginal unit is zero. This occurs after 

116 
 Part I / Chapter 3
nine units are purchased in   figure 3.5a . From the individual consumer ’ s vantage 
point, paying a zero price is advantageous. Who from the standpoint of a private 
individual could not be in favor of this? However, from society ’ s standpoint, this 
is overconsumption unless the marginal cost of producing nine units is zero, which 
is highly unlikely. Suppose instead the marginal cost equals  p , which would occur 
under perfectly functioning competitive markets. Then for each unit after five, the 
consumer is not willing to pay as much as  p = marginal cost (MC), and more value 
is used up in resources to produce the nine units than the consumer, here a rep-
resentative of all consumers, is willing to pay for them. 
 Setting price at zero results in a welfare loss of  BEF  in   figure 3.5b . With a 
zero price, there is a welfare loss of  BFE.  Providers are paid 0 AFE  by insurers. 
Although people pay nothing for the services they receive at the point of service, 
insurers must collect the 0 AFE  that they pay the providers. So consumers pay this 
as a premium, or as taxpayers if the insurance plan is provided by governments. 
Thus, in sum, the representative consumer is willing to pay up to 0 DBE  for  x . 
services and pays 0 AFE in premiums. So the consumer enjoys the consumer 
surplus of  ADB but incurs a welfare loss of  BFE . From what we have said thus far, 
the consumer is better off without health insurance. If she has no insurance, she 
pays a price  p and enjoys the consumer surplus of  ABD . However, if she has com-
plete insurance, that is, she receives  “ free ” care at the point of service, the benefit 
 ADB is offset at least in part by the welfare loss,  BEF . The area  BEF  may more than 
offset the consumer surplus  ADB .

 117
 Economists use demand curves to value the benefit of a particular public 
project, or we could use demand curves to value whether or not the provisions of 
a particular national health insurance plan are socially optimal. The consumer 
surplus is a measure of social benefit to consumers under some restrictive assump-
tions. First, one must trust that consumers are knowledgeable about the benefits to 
themselves when they make purchasing decisions. Especially, outside of the eco-
nomics profession, there is widespread skepticism that consumers are able to assess 
the benefits, and for this reason, other measures of benefit are used. Second, there 
can be no externalities in receipt of the service. If, for example, the service is a 
vaccination against a communicable disease, summing over individual consumer 
demand curves will underestimate social benefit. Third, one must assume that the 
income effects of price changes are small. 
 This assumption is not totally realistic since a product price decrease increases 
the consumer ’ s real income. However, for decreases in price of most products, the 
increase in real income is small unless many product prices fall together. In public 
policy deliberations, the quantity demanded is often taken at the level of observed 
consumption, which under complete insurance may be a mean quantity per con-
sumer where the demand curve intersects the quantity axis. Such consumption 
levels are sometimes considered to be the level of  “ need, ” which is compared to a 
measure of supply to determine whether there is a surplus or a shortage of a given 
type of health care personnel. But the quantity at which the demand curve

intersects the quantity axis may be far higher than the level of use that is socially 
optimal. 
 Newhouse and Sinaiko (2008 ) have pointed out an important limitation of 
the welfare analysis just described, namely that demand for particular personal 
health care services may be interrelated, which at a minimum greatly adds to the 
complexity of welfare analysis. Suppose, for example, taking a drug to reduce high 
blood pressure on a regular basis reduces the probability of having a heart attack. 
Then taking the drug should affect the demand for curative care from hospitals and 
physicians. It is necessary to consider these effects as well. If the individual has 
health insurance coverage for hospital and physicians ’ services, it is unlikely that 
this person ’ s demand for the blood pressure medication will fully reflect the benefit 
of reduced use of hospital and physician care at some later date. 
 3.6 
 Other Determinants of Demand for Personal 
Health Care Services 
 Although economists, as we have done in this chapter, tend to emphasize the roles 
of the price of personal health care services and income as determinants of the 
demand for care, there are clearly many other important demand determinants. As 
discussed in chapter 2, health services are an input into the production of health. 
Except perhaps for hypochondriacs or persons who find visiting the doctor enter-
taining, the vast majority of people seek care to improve their personal health. The 
final output is health. The flow from the health stock, healthy days or their equiva-
lent, is an argument in individuals ’ utility functions. People are at a higher level 
of utility when their health is good, holding other factors constant. 
 In chapter 2, we showed how a person ’ s age can be incorporated into a stan-
dard economic framework. A person ’ s health stock tends to depreciate with age, 
and higher rates of depreciation lead to more investment in health. In an effort to 
restore good health, people demand knee replacements, plastic surgery to remove 
lines in the face that grow more numerous with age, drugs to decrease levels of 
blood glucose for persons who develop diabetes, the prevalence of which increases 
with age, and so on. 
 Likewise, economics can at least partially explain differences in the use of 
health care services by a person ’ s educational attainment. More educated persons 
may be more efficient in health production (see  Grossman 1972a, 1972b ) because 
they are better able to detect signs and symptoms of illnesses earlier, better able to 
understand physicians ’ recommendations, or more efficient in searching among 
physicians to select a physician for a particular condition they might have. Fur-
thermore, education may affect time preference, the trade-off of costs and future 
returns from an investment ( Fuchs 1982 ;  Becker and Mulligan 1997 ). 

Demand for Health Care Services 
 119
 Economists can incorporate such demand factors in their models, but they 
cannot eliminate the possibility that such variables as age and educational attain-
ment operate through other causal pathways than implied by economic theory. In 
an economic framework, many of these demand determinants other than price and 
income appear as preference differences in the person ’ s utility function. In econom-
ics, we say that individuals maximize utility, and we write down a general utility 
function. However, with very few exceptions, economics does not provide explana-
tions of how preferences are formed. For example, different cultures have different 
views of illness and death or of privacy, which may affect the use of personal health 
services. Economics must take these preferences as given. We economists have no 
theory as to why an individual may get more extra utility from another unit of 
transportation, for example, than from another unit of health. 
 Other demand factors are biologically determined. Economics cannot explain 
individual differences in genetic makeup or how these genetic factors affect health 
and the derived demand for personal health services. 
 Further, in a larger model, health behaviors and the use of personal health 
services are jointly determined. For example, a person with mild diabetes might 
be able to control his or her disease with moderate exercise and a healthy diet. 
Some persons may have a distaste for exercising, preferring to take pills for diabe-
tes. Since the pills require a prescription, this type of person may be more likely 
to visit a doctor. 
 In sum, economics is very useful for explaining how price and income affect 
demand for health services. Through models such as  Grossman ’ s (1972a, 1972b ), 
an economic framework can provide a partial explanation for the roles of such 
variables as educational attainment and age as demand determinants. But other 
disciplines have other explanations that are equally plausible. Economics can 
explain a lot, but there is a lot we economists cannot explain. To gain a fuller 
understanding of the determinants of demand for health care services and health, 
it is important to work with scholars in several disciplines. 
 3.7 
 Summary and Conclusions 
 In combination with the previous chapter, this chapter has provided an economic 
framework for studying price and income determinants of demand for personal 
health services. We have also described alternative sources of data for testing 
hypotheses about demand relationships and estimating responsiveness of the quan-
tity demanded to price and income changes. The difference between observational 
data and data from RCTs is an important one; the issues that lead one to conduct 
an RCT have many other applications than just studies of demand for personal 
health services. This chapter has devoted considerable attention to the RAND 

120 
 Part I / Chapter 3
Corporation ’ s HIE study. Although this study is now old, it remains the landmark 
study of demand for health services. Given the considerable expense of the study, 
it is highly unlikely that it will be repeated any time in the future. 
 While the HIE continues to be regarded as a pathbreaking study, no study is 
without limitations. In the case of the HIE, major limitations are that it only focused 
on the demand side of the market — quantity and price depend on both supply and 
demand, and, except possibly for the comparisons of fee-for-service and capitation 
methods of payment, it did not investigate how providers respond to various incen-
tives or disincentives to supply additional services. Having a stop loss set at 10 
percent of personal income and excluding persons over age 62 also limits the infer-
ences that can be drawn from the HIE findings. 
 The HIE study shows that the amounts people pay out of pocket for health 
services does affect demand. Lowering the out-of-pocket price results in a welfare 
loss even though, as described in chapter 4, out-of-pocket price reductions also 
result in a welfare gain that is partially offsetting or could more than offset the 
welfare loss described in this chapter. 
 In the HIE, individuals were assigned health insurance plans randomly as 
part of the experiment. In the real world, whether or not a person is covered by 
health insurance at all may be a matter of personal choice, as the provisions of the 
plan conditional on deciding to be insured may be. For this reason, choice of health 
plan, health services ’ utilization, and even health may be jointly determined, or at 
least determined as a sequence of closely related choices. Chapter 4 ’ s analysis of 
demand for private insurance thus follows directly from the discussions of demand 
for health and demand for personal health services in chapters 2 and 3.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 3.1  
 Give examples to illustrate how the following can be substitutes or 
complements:  
 
  physician and hospital services; 
 
  physician services and prescription drugs; 
 
  dentist and dental hygienist services; 
 
  optometrist and ophthalmologist services; 
 
  office manager and physician. 
 3.2  
 Prior to 1970, private health insurers in the United States usually treated 
maternity care differently from other medical expenses; maternity care was 
either excluded entirely from coverage or subject to a flat lump-sum cash 
( “ indemnity, ”  in insurance jargon) benefit. Why do you think this was so? 
(Please give a reason other than discrimination against women, which might 
have been a reason as well but does not illustrate the economic principle we 
are looking for.) During the 1970s, twenty-three US states mandated that treat-
ment related to pregnancy be covered by insurers in the same way as any 
other types of treatment were, and in 1978, such coverage became uniform 
throughout the United States. Would mandated maternity benefits make 
working in a salaried position more or less attractive to women? Would it 
make women of childbearing age more or less attractive to employees? Would 
it increase or decrease the number of births performed by cesarean section 
(surgical removal of the baby from the mother ’ s uterus, a more expensive 
method of delivery than a normal delivery)? Who do you think bore the 
expense of implementing this mandate — consumers in the form of higher 
product prices, firms ’ owners in the form of lower profits, or employees in 
the form of lower pay? Explain your answer. 
 3.3  
 Does the welfare loss from overconsumption of medical care in the presence 
of health insurance coverage imply that consumers will not demand health 
insurance? Why or why not? 
 Exercises 
 3.1   Suppose a demand curve has the form  x = 100  – 10 p . What is the quantity 
consumed at  p = 5? What is the elasticity of demand at  p = 5? Suppose the demand 

122 
 Part I / Chapter 3
curve is a demand curve facing the firm, such as a physician ’ s office. At what level 
of  p is marginal revenue zero? Why may the demand curve for the firm have a 
negative slope? When marginal revenue is zero, what is the price elasticity at this 
level of  p ? Would giving the patient a $5 subsidy per visit tend to increase or 
decrease the elasticity of demand? Justify your answers. 
 3.2  Suppose that the price of a unit of medical care is $100 and the person ’ s 
insurance policy covers up to $100,000 in expenditures incurred on behalf of the 
insured individual per year. Show graphically how the maximum payment limit 
affects the quantity demanded. Assume a zero co-pay up to the limit. 
 3.3  An individual has preferences for an aggregate consumption commodity ( x ) 
and health ( H ) represented by a utility function  U ( x ,  H ) =  α ln( x ) +  β ln( H ). The price 
of the aggregate commodity ( x ) is  p x and the price of medical care ( m ) is  p m . The 
input of medical care ( m ) produces health ( H ) via a health production relationship 
that can be represented by the function  g ( m ) = ln( m ); that is,  H = ln( m ). 
 a.  Compute the optimal demand for medical care ( m ), the aggregate consumption 
commodity ( x ) and health ( H ) as functions of prices ( p x ,  p m ), income ( y ), and 
the parameters of the model ( α ,  β ). You may assume a standard budget 
constraint. 
 b.  Calculate the price elasticity of demand for medical care. 
 3.4  Explain the difference between a  “ stop loss ” and a  “ deductible. ”  Let the 
demand curve for an individual be  x m = 30  –  p m . Suppose all doctors charge $10 
per unit of care consumed. Let there be a deductible of $100 and a stop loss of 
$200. Let the coinsurance rate be 0.5. What is the effect of such insurance on the 
demand for medical care? 
 3.5 
 a.  Show the effect graphically of a deductible on the demand for medical care. 
 Assume no insurance coverage initially. Then assume there is an insurance policy 
with a $500 deductible. The price of medical care is $50 per unit. After the deduct-
ible is satisfied, the health insurance plan pays for 75 percent of expenses. 
 b.  Now assume the policy does not have a deductible but pays 100 percent of 
expenses up to a stop loss of $2,000. Show this graphically. 
 3.6  The following questions are based on   table 3.2 : 
 a.  Compute arc elasticities for free to 25%, 25% to 50%, and 50% to 95% plans 
for face-to-face visits. What do these results imply about the price elasticities of 

Demand for Health Care Services 
 123
face-to-visits that is relevant to public policy? Compute arc elasticities for 
expenses overall. Again, what are the implications for public policy? 
 b.  How does mean predicted expenditure compare in the free versus the 95% 
plan? 
 c.  Cost sharing for outpatient services (individual deductible plan) produces a 
different pattern than does cost sharing for all services. Explain. 
 d.   The admission rate for the individual deductible plan lies roughly midway 
between the free plan and the family coinsurance plan rates. Explain. 
 3.7 
 a.  How are the income terciles in   table 3.6  defined? 
 b.  How do probability of any use, probability of admission, and expenses change 
with increases in income? What accounts for the differences in patterns across 
the three categories? 
 c.  How does cost sharing affect expenses in each of the three income groups? 
Describe with elasticities. Based on your calculation, please answer the question 
on whether the demand response to increased cost sharing is different between 
the poor person and the non-poor person. Are your results obtained from   table 
3.6  consistent with theoretical prediction? 
 3.8   Suppose that doctors were to increase direct advertisement to the public about 
their services (with no other changes in the economic environment). What would 
you expect to happen to the demand for medical care (in the short run)? Explain 
graphically. Do not write more than five lines. What might you expect to happen 
in the long run (e.g., over 5 to 10 years)? Do not write more than five lines for this 
part as well. 
 3.9   Explain which of the following types of insurance coverage would most likely 
cause the most major problems resulting from moral hazard. (If you do not know 
some of the medical terms, check out Google.com.) 
 a.  indemnity payments of $10,000 for each eye or limb lost or indemnity payments 
of $50 for each day spent in the nursing home; 
 b.  arthroscopic surgery for knee injuries or amputation of the foot; 
 c.  family counseling or electroconvulsive therapy; 
 d.   decongestants or antibiotics. 
 3.10   Bill ’ s new insurance policy contains a prescription plan that provides all 
drugs through a local pharmacy with a $2 co-payment. Under the old insurance 

124 
 Part I / Chapter 3
plan, Bill had to pay for his own medication and purchased nine inhalers at $17 
apiece to help control his asthma. With the new plan, Bill purchases fifteen inhal-
ers, keeping some of the spares in his glove compartment and desk, since he only 
has to pay a $2 co-payment for each one. How much are the six additional inhalers 
worth to Bill? How much do they cost him? How much do they cost the insurance 
company? Is Bill better off or worse off under the new plan? 
 3.11  Use the equation for time price given by equation 3.3 in the text to answer 
the following questions. 
 a.  Would you expect the elasticity of demand with respect to  c to be higher or 
lower for a business executive than for a day laborer? Explain your answer. 
 b.  Who would be more likely to use a  “ free clinic ” (free in the sense that the money 
price of services = 0)? Why? 
 3.12  Suppose the county in which you live provides flu shots at pharmacies in 
the county for $5. Facing a budgetary crisis, the county raises the price of flu shots 
to $10. After two flu seasons, the county observes that the percentage of the popu-
lation getting flu shots decreased from 50 percent to 40 percent. Calculate the 
implied arc elasticity of demand. What is potentially wrong with this calculation, 
and what additional data would you need to collect to fix it? 
 3.13  Assume there are two drugs designed to treat high blood pressure, drug A 
and drug B. Blood pressure readings from patients taking drug A are consistently 
higher than those of patients taking drug B. Does this mean that drug B is more 
effective than drug A? Why or why not? Describe how a randomized controlled 
trial could be set up to settle this issue.

 Demand for Private Health 
Insurance 
 While most countries, especially high- and middle-income countries, offer some 
public health insurance coverage, private health insurance is also marketed in most 
of these countries. The same underlying concepts apply to both public and private 
health insurance in that both protect covered persons against the risk of incurring 
out-of-pocket expenditures for personal health services ( “ expenditure risk ” ). In this 
chapter, we focus on the demand side of private insurance market, leaving the 
topics of supply of private health insurance to chapters 10 and 11 and public health 
insurance to chapter 12. 
 The fundamental reason people demand insurance is that they are risk averse. 
This chapter starts with the concepts of expected utility and risk aversion. We show 
how risk aversion causes individuals to demand insurance and why risk-averse 
individuals are willing to pay more than their expected losses for insurance. Since 
there are administrative costs to running an insurance company, a necessary condi-
tion for the existence of an insurance market is that people be willing to pay more 
than their insurance policy ’ s expected loss. 
 While the provision of insurance can improve the well-being of members of 
society, it is possible for people to have too much coverage, that is, to be overin-
sured. Overinsurance arises when the welfare loss due to moral hazard, discussed 
in chapter 3, exceeds the welfare gain arising from insurance ’ s expenditure risk 
protection feature. 
 Initially, we assume there is only one insurer offering one insurance plan. Of 
course, realistically, there are likely to be many insurers with many plans in a 
market. With many insurance products available to an individual, healthy indi-
viduals may tend to buy lower-cost policies offering less coverage, such as plans 

128 
 Part I / Chapter 4
with higher deductibles, coinsurance, or co-pays, since they do not expect to 
become ill. By contrast, persons in poor health may demand more complete cover-
age. Adverse selection in health insurance markets arises when individuals select 
insurance policies based in part on their individual health when the health of the 
individual is not fully reflected in premium differences. A possible consequence 
of adverse selection in private insurance markets is that certain types of insurance 
coverage, especially relatively complete coverage, become unavailable. Although 
having cost sharing reduces moral hazard and the welfare loss associated with it, 
at least some persons, those who are very risk averse, are made worse off when 
complete insurance is unavailable. 
 This chapter begins with a discussion of the relationship among health, 
health insurance, and the use of personal health care services. Here, unlike in the 
previous chapter, the major choice being made is the selection of a health insurance 
policy by an individual. Expected use of services during the policy year potentially 
plays a role in such choices. Willingness to pay for an insurance policy depends 
in part on the extent to which the person is tolerant or intolerant of bearing risk; 
the latter type of person is said to be risk averse. Using a minimal number of 
assumptions, we show how individuals decide on their willingness to pay the 
insurer for risk bearing. When insurers rather than individual risk-averse consum-
ers bear risk, there is a welfare gain to such individuals. This gain, however, may 
be offset in part or in full by the welfare loss from moral hazard, which we 
described in the last chapter. The model we describe offers several predictions 
about how various factors affect demand for private insurance. 
 The two major threats to the existence of private insurance markets are adverse 
selection and moral hazard. We discuss why adverse selection may arise in insur-
ance markets and what insurers can do about it, as well as the effects adverse selec-
tion may have on the functioning of insurance markets. We then describe the results 
of empirical studies of adverse selection in various types of insurance markets. 
Overall, although there is some evidence of adverse selection, which certainly 
played out in the story about the Harvard University health plan we describe below, 
there is also evidence against adverse selection in some insurance markets. Since 
the empirical evidence on adverse selection is mixed, the presence or absence of 
adverse selection should be assessed on an insurance market – specific basis. 
 4.1  
 Relationships among Health, Health Insurance, 
and the Use of Personal Health Care Services 
 The demand for personal health services and the demand for health insurance are 
closely linked. First, provisions of the health insurance policy, such as deductibles, 
co-pays, and stop losses, influence the quantity and types of services demanded. 

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 129
Second, the person ’ s expectation of the quantity and types of services to be used 
in the period to be covered by the insurance policy may influence the person ’ s 
choice of health insurance plan. Two persons with the same demographic charac-
teristics and even with the same health history may nevertheless expect vastly 
different utilization of personal health services during the next policy year. The 
insurer may be at a disadvantage in knowing these differences when the health 
insurance premium is set. If so, there is asymmetric information between potential 
buyers and sellers of insurance. Those buyers who expect to incur expenditures 
during the policy year in excess of the premium will want to purchase the insur-
ance policy. Those with expected expenditures below the premium may want to 
reject the policy and look elsewhere or perhaps not purchase insurance at all. 
 Many decisions, such as which college or university to attend, career choice, 
and choice of spouse, have uncertain outcomes. In chapter 2, we described uncer-
tainties in future health that lead to uncertainties about the future use of personal 
health services. 
 The uncertainty driving the demand for health insurance arises from the 
random nature of health and illness. In the absence of some institutional factors to 
be described below, if one knew with certainty what one would pay for personal 
health care services next year, there would be no demand for health insurance. 
Conditional on being alive, we can quite be sure that we will eat two or three 
meals a day and brush our teeth twice daily next year. We do not buy insurance 
coverage for next year ’ s food expenditures or toothpaste because future expendi-
tures on these items are reasonably certain. Yet we may or may not be involved 
in a motor vehicle accident, and our homes may or may not be destroyed by fire. 
For this reason, there is a demand for automobile insurance and homeowners ’ 
coverage. 
 Health per se is uninsurable. Although there are income replacement insur-
ance policies, usually known as disability insurance, in general, one cannot pur-
chase an insurance policy on one ’ s own health ( Arrow 1963 ). Health care providers 
are compensated based on the care they give rather than on the outcomes of such 
care, with very rare exceptions such as are discussed in box 4.1. For example, there 
is no market that would compensate persons if they were unable to walk or if their 
heart or lung capacity dropped below a certain threshold. However, markets for 
health insurance supply insurance policies that cover services in the event one 
breaks a leg or if a heart attack or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
damages one ’ s heart or lungs.  
 Why is health uninsurable (with rare exceptions such as those described in 
box 4.1)? In a hypothetical world in which hospitals and physicians did not exist, 
there might still be a private market to protect individuals against loss due to 
illness. People would likely seek protection from income loss due to illness and 
premature death and for other losses such as expenditures on a caregiver should 
they become unable to care for themselves.

 4.2 
 Insurance Concepts and Terminology 
 It is difficult to analyze the decisions of participants in health care markets without 
considering health insurance. Although widespread, insurance is a specialized 
subject with its own terminology and concepts. For this reason, we begin our 
analysis of demand for health insurance coverage with a description of some fun-
damental terms and concepts. 
 First-Party and Third-Party Insurance 
 Insurance may be categorized in several ways. One important distinction is between 
first-party and third-party insurance. First-party insurance protects policyholders 
against losses occurring as the result of accident, injury, illness, or some other 
adverse event to the policyholder him- or herself. Health, disability, and life 
 Box 4.1 
 Optimal and Second-Best Health Insurance 
 As originally pointed out by Kenneth  Arrow (1963) , one of the first economists to 
receive the Nobel Prize in Economics, the first-best solution for coping with uncer-
tainty in health care would be to have health insurance that paid for health to be 
restored to its original state, that is, the state of health before the illness or injury 
occurred. Such insurance is not marketed in large part because health care providers 
are not paid in proportion to the share of original health restored. 
 There is one case in which payment on the basis of health improvements is made. 
 Leonard (2003)  reported on methods of paying traditional healers in Africa. Such 
healers are often paid based on the health outcomes they achieve. Traditional healers 
can enforce outcome-contingent payment because patients believe that healers are 
agents of higher powers, As a result, healers can enforce and verify outcomes of treat-
ment of gall illness or injury conditions. Healers have a reputation of poisoning or 
cursing patients with whom they are displeased. Thus, if a patient does not pay the 
healer for the value added in health attributable to the healer ’ s effort, the healer may 
revoke the health improvement or invoke a curse. Since payment is outcome-contin-
gent, the healer has an incentive to exert effort up to the point at which the marginal 
benefit from extending extra effort equals the marginal cost to the health of doing so. 
Patients may also have an incentive to exert effort in their treatment, and there may 
be complementarities between healer and patient efforts. 
 Of course, the marginal product of healer effort has not been demonstrated empiri-
cally. We need not assume that the marginal product is zero or even negative, espe-
cially when combined with patient effort to improve health outcomes. There is no 
conceptual reason that empirical analysis of outcomes in the context of healers could 
not be conducted. If it is possible to elicit cooperation from healers in research proj-
ects, this seems like a worthwhile undertaking.

insurance, and the kind of motor vehicle insurance that covers losses incurred by 
one ’ s own motor vehicle ( “ collision insurance ” in the United States), are examples 
of first-party insurance. 
 Third-party insurance protects policyholders against the loss incurred by 
others when the loss is attributable to an action or inaction on the part of the poli-
cyholder for which the policyholder is held responsible. For example, homeowners 
may insure against injuries to others that occur on the policyholders ’ premises. 
Suppose during a snowfall, the policyholder-homeowner forgets to clear the 
walkway and a visitor falls and breaks a bone. The homeowner may be held respon-
sible for this injury since he or she failed to take adequate precautions, namely, to 
clear the walkway or post a sign that the walkway was slippery; the homeowner 
may thus be held responsible for covering the cost of the accident. Similarly, motor 
vehicle operators purchase insurance to cover the losses to others caused by an 
accident. Physicians purchase insurance to cover the losses to others from medical 
injuries attributable to an inaction or action of physicians. This is medical mal-
practice insurance (see chapter 7). 
 Pecuniary and Nonpecuniary Loss 
 Health insurance covers a range of expenditures associated with the receipt of 
personal health care services, but it does not include payment for nonpecuniary 
loss. Such loss includes loss attributed to pain and suffering or loss of consortium 
(e.g., loss of the companionship of a spouse), or loss of a chance at life. Although 
becoming sick or injured can be highly unpleasant and painful, and lead to a loss 
in utility, there is generally no private first-party insurance protection against such 
loss from pain and suffering. A possible reason is that people may feign or exag-
gerate pain in order to collect from the insurance company, which is a form of 
moral hazard. 
 However, such nonpecuniary loss is generally covered by third-party insur-
ance. A possible reason is that in a third-party context, the injurer has an incentive 
to question claims of the injured party that the latter incurred nonpecuniary loss 
as a result of an accident or surgery, and demands for payment for nonpecuniary 
loss are potentially subject to review by a court of law. By contrast, there is no such 
review of first-party insurance claims. 
 The Price of Insurance 
 Like all goods and services, demand for insurance depends on its  “ own ”  price. In 
the context of insurance, it is necessary to consider two prices. The first is the 
premium on the health insurance policy. The second is the loading factor on the 
policy. 
 The premium is the sum of two parts, the actuarially fair premium and the 
loading factor. The actuarially fair premium is the amount that an insurer expects 

132 
 Part I / Chapter 4
to pay for covered expenditures incurred by the policyholder during the policy 
year. The policy year represents the time period for which the premium, and 
hence coverage, applies. The loading factor consists of costs associated with the 
business of insurance, such as the cost of marketing health insurance, claims pro-
cessing, and other costs, plus a profit, all expressed on a per policy basis. For 
example, if the insurer expects to pay $800 for the person ’ s medical expenditures 
if the person becomes ill, which has a probability of 0.4, and to pay out nothing 
for medical expenditures if the person remains healthy, the expected value (a 
concept described in chapter 2) of insurer payments on behalf of the policyholder 
is $320. 
 However, the insurer incurs costs per insured individual in excess of 
$320 for several reasons. First, it incurs expenses marketing the company ’ s 
products to potential customers and enrolling customers in its plans. Second, there 
are costs of claims processing. Third, the insurer must pay suppliers of capital. 
Capital funds may be in the form of equity (retained earnings, sale of stock in 
the company) or debt capital (sale of bonds, bank loans). Capital has an associated 
cost even if capital funds come from retained earnings, in which case use of the 
funds incurs opportunity costs. If the retained earnings were not used in the busi-
ness of insurance, they could potentially have been used in another business 
pursuit. 
 Thus, if the insurer charged a premium of only $320, it would operate at a 
loss. The loading factor on an insurance policy is the price of insurance. The 
loading factor may be high, even as a proportion of the expected value of insurer 
payments to physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers for covered 
services. 
 Holding all other factors constant, including the individual ’ s expectation 
of his or her future loss, as this price rises, the quantity of health insurance 
demanded falls. Policies offering full coverage have higher premiums than those 
with substantial cost sharing, but the loading may not be correspondingly 
higher. 
 The theory of demand for insurance explains the following phenomenon. 
Why do people purchase insurance at all? Why do they not self-insure? Why 
pay a price for purchased insurance when insurance can be obtained free 
of the loading by self-insuring? Why would one ever pay a load on an insurance 
policy? Why not simply save an amount equal to the actuarially fair premium 
and forgo purchasing health insurance, which is a rationale for precautionary 
saving? 
 The theory of the demand for insurance explains why people are willing to 
pay a load that is at least as great as required by insurers to supply health insur-
ance. People are willing to pay a load because they are risk averse. Most persons 
are risk averse (see, e.g.,  Barsky, Juster, Kimball, et al. 1997 ). This is the conclusion. 
We now describe the basis for this conclusion.

 Diminishing Marginal Utility of Wealth and 
the Demand for Insurance 
 Utility of Wealth 
 People desire income and wealth because it enables them to consume goods and 
services. Thus, since consumption yields utility, so does income and wealth. In 
the single-period model we use here, income and wealth are equivalent. Utility is 
never observed; rather, it is hypothesized to underlie the consumption choices 
people make. 
 Consider three possible relationships between utility and wealth ( U ( W )) in 
 figure 4.1 . In all three, utility rises with consumption, but it rises at different rates 
per unit increase in wealth. That is, the marginal utility of wealth ( Δ U / Δ W ) is 
always positive. However, the slope of the marginal utility of wealth differs among 
the three curves.  
 Curve  A shows a positive marginal utility of wealth, but the marginal utility 
of wealth decreases as wealth increases. When there is a positive but diminishing 
marginal utility, we mean that the individual prefers more wealth to less wealth,

irrespective of how much wealth the individual has. However, the extra or marginal 
utility the individual obtains from possessing an extra unit of wealth declines with 
each additional unit of wealth obtained. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth is 
lower at  W h than at  W s . The notion that people have diminishing marginal utility 
of wealth provides a justification for progressive taxation of income or wealth. If 
a rich person values a dollar less at the margin than a poor person does, transfer-
ring a dollar from the rich to the poor increases society ’ s well-being. Persons with 
the utility function depicted by curve  A in   figure 4.1  are said to be  risk averse . 
 Alternatively,  U ( W ) may be linear (curve  B ). Then marginal utility, although 
positive, is a constant value; the marginal utility of wealth does not change as 
wealth changes. Such persons are said to be  risk neutral . 
 In the third category (curve  C ), the marginal utility of wealth increases with 
increasing wealth. Under this condition, the marginal utility of  W h exceeds mar-
ginal utility at  W s . Such persons are called  risk lovers . To the extent that people 
are risk neutral, a case can be made for proportional rather than progressive taxa-
tion. If risk lovers are in the majority, there is a case for regressive taxation. 
 The curves in   figure 4.1  could be drawn if we were to elicit from an individual 
the number of utils, a theoretical measure of happiness the person derives from 
each level of wealth. These curves themselves show utility derived from specific 
amount of wealth  obtained with certainty . Although incorporated in an analysis of 
decision making under uncertainty below, these curves give utility for hypotheti-
cal, certain levels of wealth. Utils are a theoretical concept. No one has ever seen 
a util. Thus, rather than ask people about their utils, analysts infer utility in more 
indirect ways. 
 Expected Utility 
 Many outcomes, including future health status, are uncertain. Uncertainty is every-
where, and since health and longevity are so important to human beings, uncer-
tainty about future health and personal health expenditures is among the most 
important uncertainties people face. 
 The concepts described in this section were formalized more than 60 years 
ago by  John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944 ). The concept of expected 
utility maximization remains the workhorse of economic analysis of decisions 
made under uncertainty. If there were no uncertainty, expected loss would be  L 
(the loss conditional on a loss occurring) and the probability of a loss occurring, 
 Θ , would be one. There would be no market for insurance. 
 Expected utility is distinct from expected loss. Imagine that at a given point 
in time, such as a year, an individual can have either wealth  W h if he or she 
is healthy  or wealth  W s if he or she is sick.  W h  >  W s , and expected loss ( EL ) = 
(1  –  Θ )0  –  Θ L =  –  Θ (W h  –  W s ). Individuals derive a level of utility from having  W h 
available for consumption,  U ( W h ), and a level of utility to having  W s ,  U ( W s ), where 
 U ( W h )  >  U ( W s ). At this level of generality, without knowing the parameters of the 

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 135
utility function, which would tell us how much more utility accrues to the indi-
vidual in the healthy than in the sick state (then plugging in values of  W , we would 
know values of  U ), we do not know how much higher  U ( W h ) is than  U ( W s ), only 
that the utility is higher. In this simple model, the only way that health affects 
utility is through its effect on personal wealth. We do not allow utility to be a direct 
function of health here. 
 As we will show more formally below, ordinarily only risk-averse individu-
als, that, individuals with the  A -type utility of wealth curve (  fig. 4.1 ), demand 
insurance. Risk lovers (curve  C individuals) gamble and do not demand insurance. 
A risk-neutral individual would not be willing to pay any more than the actuarial 
value of the loss for insurance. 
 It is possible for a utility function to be both convex and concave with respect 
to the wealth axis (  fig. 4.2 ). People may be risk lovers when very poor, but at higher 
levels of wealth may demand insurance.  Friedman and Savage (1948)  explained 
the coexistence of gambling and insurance on this basis. They observed that poor 
people often engage in actuarially unfair gambles, that is, they pay more than the 
expected value of prizes (a concept explained more fully below), while more afflu-
ent persons often buy insurance against potential income loss.

 Part I / Chapter 4
 Having reviewed these concepts and remarks about utility of wealth func-
tions, we now turn to a more formal explanation of the model of demand for 
insurance.  
 4.4 
 Model of Demand for Insurance 
 The Basic Model 
 We assume: 
 1.  A representative individual maximizes his or her expected utility. 
 2.  If the person becomes ill, he or she incurs a fixed loss,  L . 
 3.  The probability of loss  Θ is fixed. 
 4.  The individual chooses between two courses of action: (1) buy insurance, and 
thereby incur a relatively small but certain loss in the form of an insurance 
premium, or (2) self-insure and pay no premium, but face a low probability of 
a large loss if the person becomes ill and a large probability of no loss. 
 5.  The marginal utility of wealth (or income) is decreasing in wealth (income); that 
is, the person is risk averse. 
 6.  Only wealth, not health, affects the marginal utility of wealth. This means that, 
holding wealth constant, the individual enjoys an extra dollar of wealth and the 
added consumption from this wealth the same, irrespective of whether the 
individual is in the healthy state or the sick state. Alternatively, one can think 
of the marginal utility of wealth and consumption being different in different 
health states. Suppose an individual became sick. Would the individual derive 
more or less utility from watching a big-screen television set, traveling to a 
mountain resort, or receiving care from a private duty nurse? Clearly, we are 
unable to logically deduce whether or not the marginal utility of consumption 
would rise or fall with diminished health. 
 If the person remains well,  L = 0 and wealth =  W h . However, if he or she 
becomes ill, the loss is  L , and the person is left with  W s . W s =  W h  –  L . Ex ante, it 
is expected loss ( EL ), not loss per se ( L ), that is relevant to the individual in decid-
ing whether or not to purchase an insurance policy.  EL   <  L .  W h  –  EL  =  W w .  W w thus 
reflects the weighted average  EL .  
 While the utility function ( U ( W )) shows utility as a function of wealth, this 
utility function only applies for certain wealth. If wealth is uncertain because the 
individual faces the possibility of a loss, owing, for example, to an illness, the 
relevant concept is expected utility rather than utility. When the individual faces 

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 137
the loss  L with probability  Θ , his or her expected utility ( EU ) is not  U ( W w ) but 
rather a weighted average of the utilities when well and when sick. 
 The expected utility of wealth is given by 
 EU ( W ) = (1  –  Θ ) U ( W h ) +  Θ U ( W s ). 
(4.1) 
 EU ( W ) is not  U ( W w ) but, if the person is risk averse, is something less than 
 U ( W w ). Let  W w ′ be the wealth for which  EU ( W ) equals  U ( W w ) — the utility from the 
gamble equals the utility from a certain level of wealth. Then let  U ( W w ) ′ be the 
level of utility when  W w ′ is certain. Then the individual could give an insurance 
company up to ( W w  –  W w ′ ) in a premium  above  the expected loss on the insurance 
policy and still be as well off as if he or she did not buy insurance and faced the 
prospect of an uncertain  W h or  W s . Ex post, that is, after the year is over, the person 
never attains this level of wealth without insurance, but rather has  W h or  W s , 
depending on whether the person stayed healthy or not.  W w is a weighted average 
of mutually exclusive outcomes. 
 Graphically,  U ( W s ) is at point  A in   figure 4.3 and  U ( W h ) is at point  B . The 
cord connecting points  A and  B represents the locus of expected values of  U ( W s ) 
and  U ( W h ). As  Θ increases, the expected value moves along the cord to the left, 
and conversely for reductions in  Θ .  
 We digress for a moment to show that the cord connecting  U when healthy 
and when sick is linear. We take as given that there are only two outcomes, being 
healthy and becoming sick. Then the expected utility is a weighted average of 
utility when healthy. Recall that  EU  = (1  –  Θ ) U ( W h ) +  Θ U ( W s ). Now suppose that 
the probability of becoming sick rises from  Θ to  Θ  δ  . The  EU becomes  EU ′ = (1  – 
 Θ  δ  ) U ( W h ) +  Θ  δ  U ( W s ).  EU ′  <  EU . If ( Θ  δ  / Θ ) = 0.9,  EU ′ = 0.9 EU . Expected loss and 
expected utility vary as  Θ varies. 
 Now consider how much utility the person derives from  W w , which is  W h 
minus the expected loss from health expenditures incurred by the individual. If 
the insurer set the premium of the insurance policy at its actuarial value,  W w is the 
level of wealth the person would have left over after paying this premium. But note 
that  W w  corresponds to utility levels at points  C and  D . Utility at  D is higher than 
at  C . Point  D is the utility this risk-averse individual would obtain if the wealth 
level  W w were certain. However, without full insurance,  W w is an expected value, 
not a certain value. Thus, the risk-averse individual prefers certainty to the chance 
that he or she will end up with  W w . The utility difference between a certain and 
an uncertain wealth of  W w is the vertical distance between points  D and  C . 
 Since utility is higher at  D than it is at  C , an insurer can charge a premium 
in excess of the actuarial value of the loss, and the risk-averse person will still be 
better off or at least not worse off than with an uncertain level of wealth with the 
expected value  W w .  EC in f  igure 4.3  represents the maximum amount above the 
actuarial value of the loss that the person would be willing to pay to have a certain 

138 
 Part I / Chapter 4
rather than an uncertain level of wealth. The utility of wealth at  E is equal to the 
expected utility of wealth at  C . If the insurer extracts less money than  EC from the 
individual, the individual ’ s utility exceeds the value at  E, and wealth is greater 
than  W w  ′  . 
 Effects of Shifts in the Utility Function, Changes in  Θ , and 
Changes in  L on the Decision to Purchase Insurance 
 Shifts in the Utility Function 
 Now suppose that the utility of wealth in the healthy state increases. The person 
now values  W h more than previously and the utility of  W s stays the same. Then 
the slope of the cord connecting the two utilities increases (becomes steeper), and 
the cord becomes closer to the utility function. Or the person now values  W h less 
than before, and the distance between the cord and the utility function become 
farther apart. 
 To generalize, the distance between the utility function depends on the extent 
to which marginal utility decreases as wealth increases. A greater distance between

the utility function and the cord implies that the individual is willing to pay a 
greater premium in excess of  EL . A greater distance implies a higher willingness 
to pay for insurance, that is, a higher demand for insurance. 
 If marginal utility does not vary with wealth, that is, if it is a constant value, 
the cord and the utility function coincide. The person is  risk neutral , and the 
maximum amount the person is willing to pay for insurance above  EL  is zero. 
Under these circumstances, an insurance market cannot exist. Insurers would 
not be willing to supply insurance at a zero loading. Thus, a prerequisite for the 
existence of an insurance market is a diminishing marginal utility of wealth (or 
income). 
 Change in Probability of Incurring a Loss (Becoming Sick) 
 When  Θ , the probability of incurring a loss because of illness, decreases, the actu-
arially fair premium decreases. There is a corresponding upward movement along 
the cord in   figure 4.3 . (The reverse occurs for increases in  Θ .) 
 Suppose that  Θ becomes so small that the point on the cord is almost at point 
 B . Then the distance between the cord and the utility curve becomes very small. 
When this distance is small, it is easily shown that the line (parallel to the wealth 
axis) from the point on the cord to the utility curve becomes very small as well. 
When this line is short, willingness to pay a premium much above the actuarially 
fair premium is low as well. In other words, demand for insurance is low. 
 Likewise, for points on the cord near  A , the probability of incurring a loss is 
nearly 1.0. There is not much demand for insurance when losses are nearly certain 
to occur, either. 
 To generalize, holding other factors constant, demand for insurance is highest 
when  Θ is in the midrange and lowest when  Θ is nearly 0.0 or 1.0. 
 Change in the Magnitude of the Loss Conditional on Incurring a 
Loss (Becoming Sick) 
 Because of health care cost inflation, which has occurred in many countries, the 
potential loss conditional on becoming sick has increased, especially in those 
countries without comprehensive public health insurance systems. 
 An increase in  L means that  W s moves to the left. Thus the cord from  A to  B 
lies below the cord shown at   figure 4.3  except at point  B , which is the same as in 
the figure. A lower cord implies a greater horizontal distance between the cord and 
the utility curve. A greater distance implies that demand for insurance is higher 
than for a lower  L . The inference is that an increase in  L , holding other factors 
constant, boosts demand for insurance. 
 The Risk-Lover Case 
 Thus far we have seen that risk-averse individuals may be better off with insurance 
and risk-neutral persons do not demand insurance. Now consider the third case, 

140 
 Part I / Chapter 4
in which the marginal utility of wealth is increasing (not decreasing or constant). 
Persons with an increasing marginal utility of wealth do not insure but rather 
engage in gambling. An increasing marginal utility of wealth means that the person 
values receiving an extra dollar more when wealthy than when poor. 
 Now let the person ’ s initial wealth be  W A (  fig. 4.4 ). The probability of winning 
is  Θ w . Then the expected gain is  EG , where  EG =  Θ w G and  G (=  W C  –  W A ) is the 
amount the gambler wins if he or she wins. A risk lover is willing to pay more 
than  EG for the opportunity to gamble. The person in  figure 4.4  has higher utility 
when  W A is uncertain (point  A ′ ) than when wealth is certain (point  A ). So the 
person has a maximum willingness to pay for a gamble, which is  W A  –  W A . ″ 
This loading factor is a substantial share of the price of the gamble, which is 
 W A  –  W B .  
 Implications of Theory: Determinants of Demand for 
Insurance 
 The above framework yields several predictions about who will demand insurance 
and under which circumstances insurance will be demanded. First, let ’ s consider 
the price of insurance. Risk-neutral persons and risk lovers do not demand

 141
insurance. Willingness to pay for insurance among risk-averse individuals depends 
on the extent to which the marginal utility of wealth declines with increases in 
wealth. Increases in the loading should lead to decreased demand for insurance. 
The first persons to drop out of the insurance market when premiums increase are 
the relatively less risk-averse individuals. 
 Second, demand for insurance depends on the size of the loss incurred by 
the household when people become sick. Hospital care tends to be expensive. By 
contrast, a follow-up office visit (a revisit) is typically  relatively  less expensive. 
With higher loss, holding the degree of risk aversion constant, the cord becomes 
more distant from the utility function. 
 For this reason, we expect higher demand for insurance for services with a 
high associated loss than for services with a lower associated loss. In the United 
States, private hospital insurance coverage grew widespread before private insur-
ance for physicians ’ services became widespread. 
 Third, to the extent that the marginal utility of wealth declines with increased 
wealth, one would expect relatively less affluent persons to have a greater demand 
for insurance than more affluent persons. A $1,000 loss to a millionaire generates 
a lower loss in utility than the same loss occurring to an individual with an annual 
income of $10,000. 
 However, in reality, more affluent persons are more likely to be covered by 
insurance. As discussed below, this fact does not contradict the expected income 
hypothesis; rather this empirical pattern reflects various policy and institutional 
factors. 
 Fourth, demand for insurance reflects variance of loss. Probabilities of loss 
near 1 or near 0 have a low variance. The variance is highest at the middle of the 
0 – 1 interval, that is, at  Θ = 0.5. 
 Finally, as indicated above, the expected utility model assumes that demand 
for care is not responsive to price. Rather,  L is assumed to be fixed. But, more 
realistically, the quantity of care demanded is generally responsive to changes in 
its price. Thus, the demand for insurance coverage for services whose demand is 
relatively price inelastic is relatively high. 
 Recall from the previous chapter that the welfare loss from insurance cover-
age depends on the price elasticity of demand for the service. The welfare loss is 
higher when the price elasticity of demand is higher. When the price elasticity is 
higher, the expected loss is higher, leading to a higher premium. Even if the indi-
vidual does not consume more services when insurance is complete, in setting the 
premium of the insurance policy, the insurer assumes that the quantity demanded 
will be greater when the price to the user is lower. So the premium will be higher. 
 The decision to purchase insurance is made before illness strikes. Ex ante, 
the consumer is unlikely to want to pay for all the services that people with com-
plete coverage use. 

142 
 Part I / Chapter 4
 The Premium of a Health Insurance Policy 
 Let  R be the health insurance premium of a health insurance policy. Then 
 R = (1 +  L d )(1  –  c ) pxEL , 
(4.2) 
 where  R is the premium,  L d is the loading,  c is the coinsurance rate specified in 
the insurance policy,  p is the price of medical care, and  x is the number of units 
of medical care.  px =  EL , where  EL  is expected loss. For example, if the loading is 
0.4 and  c is 0.2, the premium is 1.4 times 0.8 times  EL . 
 As explained more fully in chapter 10, the loading is much lower for insuring 
groups, especially large groups organized by a large employer, than for insuring 
individuals, and lower for larger than for small insuring groups. The loading 
reflects administration and marketing cost, the cost of claims processing, a hedge 
against adverse selection, and profit. 
 4.5 
 Empirical Issues 
 Why Do the Probability and Magnitude of the Loss Vary? 
 The probability of loss is first and foremost a function of a person ’ s health history. 
If one has had cancer or a heart attack in the past, the probability of getting another 
bout of cancer or a heart attack tends to be higher. Of course, there is inter-year 
variability, and poor health in the recent past is not a perfect predictor of health 
in the following year. Insurance coverage, income, and access to health care provid-
ers also affect the loss probability. The above model of demand for insurance 
assumes that insurance has no impact on either  p or  EL . But the empirical evidence 
suggests otherwise. 
 Demographic characteristics, such as age and gender, are positively associated 
with service use. A healthy 85-year-old has a higher probability of suffering a major 
health shock than does a healthy 35-year-old. Moreover, recommendations for 
preventive care and screening vary by age. Females tend to use more medical care 
than males, for example, during the childbearing years. However, these expendi-
tures are largely predictable — that is,  Θ is near 0.0 or 1.0 — and hence, based on the 
above model (and disregarding institutional factors discussed below), one would 
expect less demand for insurance coverage for such services. 
 The size of the expected loss reflects medical care prices and the person ’ s 
health. A serious illness is generally more costly to treat than a less serious one. 
As indicated above, type of care is also a factor. A unit of inpatient hospital care 
tends to be more costly than a unit of physicians ’ services in an ambulatory setting. 
There are regional differences within a large country and inter-country differences 
in physicians ’ practice patterns. Thus, for example, there is geographic variation 

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 143
in how a specific form of cancer is treated. Thus,  EL  will differ for this reason as 
well. 
 Why Income Affects Demand for Insurance 
 Income elasticities of demand for private health insurance are consistently positive 
(see, e.g.,  Marquis, Buntin, Escarce, et al. 2004 ). Although higher income shifts the 
demand curve for private insurance outward and to the right, underlying the 
overall positive relationship are factors that lead to decreased as well as increased 
demand for insurance. 
 As emphasized above, only risk-averse individuals demand insurance. And 
higher degrees of risk aversion should lead to higher demand for insurance. The 
marginal utility of wealth and income is thought to be higher for the poor than for 
the affluent. For this reason, more affluent individuals should demand less, not 
more, insurance. Most of the other factors affecting demand for insurance, however, 
support a positive relationship between wealth or income and demand for 
insurance. 
 Demand for insurance reflects the person ’ s expected loss ( EL ). To the extent 
that personal health care services are a normal good, one expects the use of such 
services to rise with income. However, the demand for hospital care does not 
monotonically rise with income since poor persons tend to be relatively heavy 
consumers of hospital care (see chapter 3). But other services, particularly elective 
services, are likely to be positively related to a person ’ s income. As  EL  increases, 
so does the demand for insurance, particularly if the individual ’ s subjective belief 
about his or her future loss is not reflected in the insurer ’ s premium, which is the 
phenomenon of adverse selection. 
 The role of income as a factor shifting the demand curve for personal health 
care services is made more complicated by the role of time prices. The time 
price is part of the full price of care (see chapter 3). More affluent persons are 
likely to have higher time prices. For this reason, higher-income persons would 
demand less care. But on the other hand, since the opportunity cost of time is 
higher, the cost of time lost from work due to illness is also higher ( Blau 
and Gilleskie 2008 ). For this reason, people with higher time prices would 
demand more care, especially care that would reduce the probability that the 
illness worsens. 
 Two factors add to the complexity of income ’ s role in the demand for insur-
ance. First, lower-income persons are more likely to be eligible for public insur-
ance. In the United States, this public insurance is called Medicaid. In Germany, 
there is a similar program to Medicaid (see chapter 12). In addition, statutory insur-
ance is compulsory only for individuals below a certain level of annual compensa-
tion. After this level is reached, the individual may opt out of statutory insurance 
and purchase private insurance instead. For this reason alone, the demand for 
private health insurance would rise with income. 

144 
 Part I / Chapter 4
 Further, in the United States, employer contributions to an employee ’ s health 
insurance are not counted as personal income. Since personal income tax rates rise 
with income, what is in effect a public subsidy of private health insurance pur-
chases rises with income. Thus, in establishments in which compensation tends 
to be high, there is an incentive for employees to want to receive compensation in 
the form of such fringe benefits as health insurance. Thus, we would expect 
employers to offer more complete insurance coverage when compensation levels 
are higher. US law requires that the same health insurance plan be offered by an 
employer to all employees irrespective of the amount the employee is paid. Yet 
when the median worker is paid more, it is more likely that the employer will offer 
more generous benefits to all of its employees ( Goldstein and Pauly 1976 ). 
 The loading factor is much lower for private group insurance than it is for 
individual coverage. Holding other factors constant, persons with high incomes are 
more likely to be employed than are those with low incomes. Thus, higher-income 
persons are more likely to have health insurance, and more complete health insur-
ance, than are lower-income persons for this reason as well. 
 4.6 
 Health Insurance and Welfare: The Deadweight 
Loss of Excess Insurance Revisited 
 Any politician who claimed that his or her constituents were overinsured would 
almost surely lose the next election. Yet some economists have made the case that 
people sometimes have too much insurance. While surprising at first glance, the 
argument that people are sometimes overinsured has both theoretical and empirical 
support. There is a welfare gain to risk-averse individuals from having insurance. 
Above, we defined the maximum premium that a risk-averse person is willing to 
pay for a given amount of insurance. If the person has to pay this maximum amount 
for insurance, then there is no welfare gain from expenditure risk reduction. But 
if he or she pays anything less than this maximum amount, there is a welfare gain. 
Assuming that one can find a functional form that well approximates the utility 
function in   figure 4.3 , and that the amount spent on premiums is less than the 
maximum willingness to pay, one can calculate the welfare gain from the provision 
of health insurance. The calculations themselves are a bit complex, but the under-
lying concept is quite straightforward. 
 Offsetting this welfare gain is the welfare loss arising from moral hazard (see 
chapter 3). If demand curves for personal health care services were totally unre-
sponsive to the price paid by the policyholder out of pocket, there would be no 
welfare loss, but empirical evidence, as discussed in the previous chapter, conclu-
sively demonstrates that the quantity of personal health care services demanded is 
somewhat price responsive. 

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 145
 The welfare loss from moral hazard depends on the area of a triangle whose 
base varies directly with the change in quantity demanded when price to the con-
sumer falls. People are overinsured if the welfare loss arising from moral hazard 
is larger than the welfare gain from expenditure risk reduction. More than three 
decades ago, based on his calculations of welfare loss versus welfare gain, Martin 
 Feldstein (1973)  concluded that the empirical evidence showed that people in the 
United States had too much health insurance. 
 Manning, Newhouse, Duan, et al. (1987)  analyzed the welfare loss of moving 
from the 95 percent family plan with a $1,000 stop loss (in the RAND Health Insur-
ance Experiment; see chapter 3) to a free plan. The authors concluded that the 
welfare loss from increased moral hazard in the free plan from the switch would 
amount to $37 – $60 billion, compared to the annual health expenditure in 1984 in 
the United States of around $200 billion. They acknowledged that it would be 
appropriate to deduct some amount for the welfare gain from additional expendi-
ture risk protection in the free plan, but given the $1,000 cap, the added risk pro-
tection would be small. 
 Although this type of study is compelling, being based both on economic 
theory and empirical evidence, the conclusion holds only under the assumptions 
that economists typically make in such an analysis. For example, to the extent that 
there are externalities in consumption, that is, that person A is made worse off if 
a seemingly deserving person B does not obtain care, one cannot simply sum areas 
of triangles lying above individual demand curves, as we did in chapter 3. 
 This externality provides another rationale for insurance provision. Others 
may argue that having health insurance is something akin to a constitutional right 
every member of a society has. If so, there is not much economic analysis can say 
about whether the amount of health people in a country possess is too little, too 
much, or just right. 
 4.7 
 Role of Tax Subsidies in Demand for Health 
Insurance 
 In the United States, health insurance provided as a fringe benefit is not subject to 
any form of taxation, either the Social Security or Medicare payroll taxes on earn-
ings or the personal income tax. Thus, if one has a marginal tax rate of 40 percent, 
for example, then, compared to a dollar of wage compensation, a dollar of com-
pensation in the form of health insurance benefits is worth $1.67. The relative 
advantage of receiving compensation as a health insurance benefit increases with 
increases in the person ’ s marginal tax rate. 
 Since the marginal tax rate on personal income rises with income, the benefit 
is worth relatively more to higher earners. For this reason alone, it is not surprising 

146 
 Part I / Chapter 4
that in the United States, the fraction of persons with health insurance coverage 
rises with the level of wealth. Decreasing risk aversion with increased income is a 
reason that demand for health insurance should be lower among the affluent, but 
this effect may be more offset by such factors as the tax subsidy of health insurance 
premiums. 
 This tax subsidy also serves to limit employee awareness of increasing health 
insurance premiums. There have been proposals to limit the amount of health 
insurance benefit subject to this tax exclusion ( “ tax cap ” ), but none of these pro-
posals have been enacted into law by the US Congress. Another type of proposal 
would be to exchange the tax exclusion for a refundable tax credit when the tax-
payer purchases a qualified health insurance policy. A tax credit is a subsidy fixed 
in monetary terms. It is subtracted from the taxpayer ’ s total tax obligation. If the 
tax payer, for example, owed $10,000 in taxes and the tax credit was $1,000, this 
person would pay $9,000. The refundable feature means that if subtracting led to 
a negative amount, that amount would be paid to the taxpayer as a tax refund. 
 Suppose the tax payer owed $0 in taxes. Then a $1,000 tax credit would result 
in a tax refund of $1,000. 
 The advantage of a refundable tax credit is that, unlike the tax exclusion, the 
tax credit does not increase with the taxpayer ’ s income but rather is a fixed amount. 
Also, since the tax credit is fixed and does not depend on the insurance premium, 
people have a financial incentive to shop for efficient plans and pay for expensive 
add-on features in full. Under the current system in the United States, more expen-
sive insurance plans are subsidized in that the taxpayer pays only (1  – the tax-
payer ’ s marginal tax rate) for each dollar of additional expense. 
 Even though the advantages of a tax cap or a tax credit are well understood 
in the United States, there is political opposition to implementing a tax cap on the 
grounds that it represents an increase in taxes, which it does to higher-income 
taxpayers and to taxpayers located in geographic areas that have relatively high 
prices of health care services; thus the objection is on normative rather than on 
positive grounds. Refundable tax credits are sometimes opposed because it is 
argued that individuals in poorer health may require a higher refundable tax credit 
since they may be expected to pay more for health insurance on average. Currently, 
if persons in poor health are employed or if they have access to an employer-based 
health insurance plan through a family member who is employed, they are not 
surcharged for being in poorer health. However, if refundable tax credits were 
adopted, employer-based insurance coverage would probably become less common, 
and individuals would more often obtain health insurance outside their employ-
ment. It is under such circumstances that insurers may impose premium surcharges 
on individuals in poorer health. 
 The importance of the tax subsidy as a determinant of demand for health 
insurance depends on the price elasticity of such demand. Most estimates of the 

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 147
price elasticity are between  – 0.2 and  – 1.0, although estimates above  – 1.0 have been 
reported. Even an elasticity as low as  – 0.2 implies that the tax subsidy has an 
important distortionary effect on demand for insurance.  1 
 4.8 
 Adverse Selection 
 How Adverse Selection May Arise in Health Insurance Markets 
 In most markets, more choice is preferred to less. In private health insurance 
markets, individuals have choices: (1) when they seek to obtain health insurance 
on their own, as they do for individual health insurance in the United States; (2) 
when they purchase private supplemental health insurance that covers health 
expenditures not covered by a public health insurer, as with Medicare in the United 
States; (3) when they choose between a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan 
and Medicare operated by a health maintenance organization; and (4) when they 
purchase private insurance rather than completely rely on the public National 
Health Service (NHS) in the UK or when individuals select a sickness fund that 
operates under Germany ’ s statutory health insurance program. 
 When health insurance is employer-based, as is much health insurance in the 
United States, employees often have a choice of several health insurance plans 
sponsored by the employer. Plans may differ, for example, in what they cover and 
how much cost sharing they require. 
 A compelling argument can be made that competition among health insurers 
and choices of plans offered by each insurer and by employers allows for satisfac-
tion of diverse preferences and provides a mechanism whereby the market can 
weed out inefficient insurers — those insurers that are slow claims processors or 
that make frequent errors in claims processing, are affiliated with providers that 
consumers do not prefer, mistreat providers so that providers do not want to deal 
with them, or offer a structure of covered benefits that is unappealing to many 
consumers. 
 People do indeed have diverse preferences, including differences in risk 
preferences. 2 A more risk-averse individual may be expected to demand health 
insurance policies with smaller amounts of cost sharing. Younger families may be 
expected to be more interested in having insurance with generous maternity ben-
efits. Older individuals may be more interested in coverage for long-term care (e.g., 
home health services, nursing home services). 
 As long as insurers can anticipate use of services during the term of the insur-
ance contract as well as insured persons can, insurers should be able to accurately 
predict the health expenditures of their policyholders in advance of the policy year. 
Thus, for example, an insurer would expect an older person to use more and 
perhaps more complex services during a policy year than a younger person would.

and Adamache (1986) ,

2.  Risk preferences 
represent only one type 
of preference. Other 
types include time 
preference, differences 
in the marginal utility 
of current consumption, 
and preferences for the 
consumption of 
particular goods and 
services.

 Part I / Chapter 4
The insured ’ s age is easily observed by the insurer, and the law permitting, the 
insurer can adjust premiums to reflect such age-related differences in health ser-
vices use. 
 However, under some circumstances, the individual may know more about 
his or her health than do insurers. Suppose an individual has been experiencing 
chest pains when climbing several flights of steps. The individual expects she may 
have heart disease but has not visited a doctor for this concern yet. She figures that 
she will be using a lot of services during the coming year in diagnosing and treat-
ing this disease. The insurer knows nothing about this and does not adjust the 
premium accordingly but instead charges a premium appropriate for the average 
person in the individual ’ s age and gender category and geographic area. 
 Faced with premiums charged by each insurer/policy, the individual selects 
a policy with little cost sharing, since this will mean lower out-of-pocket payments 
for medical services during the coming year. The insurer will lose money on this 
person but it does not know this in advance. More generally, what we have just 
described is adverse selection in health insurance markets. One could perhaps 
argue that the insurer could require that the insured undergo a thorough health 
examination before the insurance policy is issued. However, unless the patient 
self-reports his or her symptoms, the physician may have to administer many types 
of tests involving several organ systems in order to detect underlying illness. 
 Consider how costly it would be to screen for heart disease if the persons 
being screened reveal no information on their symptoms. Some persons may show 
what seem to be abnormalities on tests but these results may be normal for the 
person and do not signify underlying diseases. These are false positives (see 
chapter 2). Very many persons would have to undergo screening to find a few true 
positives. 
 Where this is lawful, private insurers can and do adopt practices to combat 
adverse selection. One approach is to exclude preexisting illnesses in the insurance 
contract. Such measures can vary in stringency. For example, an insurer could 
refuse to pay for services related to a condition that it argues would have been 
known previously by the insured. However, some insured individuals would legiti-
mately have health shocks during the policy year that they did not know about or 
suspect would occur in advance of purchasing the health insurance policy. Some 
people do indeed experience heart attacks or discover that they have cancer unex-
pectedly, and they have a legitimate desire for expenditure risk protection from 
such events. Even persons with a prior illness may be surprised as well as unhappy 
about a reoccurrence. 
 Alternatively, an insurer could insert a clause that provides a reduced 
premium in the second year for persons who use the plan sparingly in the first 
year. 3 But then the insurer would have to charge a higher premium to all newly 
insured individuals in the first year as it learns the health risks of the newly insured 
individuals. 
3.  One of us has a 
dental insurance policy 
that includes a 
provision of this type. 
Both adverse selection 
and moral hazard 
are particularly 
problematic for dental 
insurance. On moral 
hazard in this context, 
see chapter 3.

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 149
 In some jurisdictions, most recently in the United States as part of national 
health reform legislation enacted in 2010, the law prevents the insurer from insert-
ing preexisting condition clauses into insurance contracts. The argument for these 
statutory prohibitions is that such clauses are unfair to persons with adverse health 
histories. 
 In addition, some jurisdictions prevent insurers from using a person ’ s health 
history as a basis for setting premiums. In some areas with such statutes, the insurer 
is allowed to vary premiums on a limited basis, such as by age, gender, and geo-
graphic location (region, urban versus rural, etc.). These are called  community 
rating  laws. The term community rating applies because premiums are set equally 
for broad classes of individuals. 
 At least at first glance, the rationale for a community rating law may seem 
strange to some. Should not people be asked to pay more for insurance if their 
expected losses are relatively high? A rationale for community rating is that we do 
not pick our parents, and thus our genetic makeup is given to each of us. If one 
has genes that predispose one to get certain diseases, there should be no financial 
penalty for this. But even if community rating can be justified on equity grounds, 
it can adversely affect the workings of a competitive private health insurance 
market. 
 Under competition, people would pay the expected value of their health care 
expenditures under the insurance contract. But under community rating, people 
pay more or less than these expected values, depending on their health. In fact, 
under community rating, adverse selection can occur without asymmetric informa-
tion between insured individuals and insurers. The insurer may know that the 
insured is sick and how sick the insured is, but the insurer cannot use this infor-
mation in setting the premiums that insured individuals pay. 
 In the United States, most private health insurance is part of the fringe benefit 
package from the individual ’ s employer. At the time of open enrollment, employ-
ees, especially those persons employed by large organizations, can choose among 
health insurance plans with differing characteristics. Among the characteristics are 
the amount of cost sharing and the health care providers included in the plan. 
Residents of a particular geographic location may prefer a particular plan because 
the doctors that work near the employee ’ s home are affiliated with a particular 
plan. 
 To the extent that the employee selects a plan based on where she lives or 
based on her risk preferences, there is no problem of adverse selection. However, 
if she knows she is sick, she may select a plan with more complete coverage. Then 
there is an adverse selection problem. The insurer will anticipate that the relatively 
ill will predominantly select certain plans, and adjust the premiums for such plans 
accordingly. The insurer in this case and certainly the employer are likely to have 
detailed records on the employee ’ s use of services in the past, but it is considered 
unethical and generally illegal to take use this information for premium setting. 

150 
 Part I / Chapter 4
The insurer can use this information in the aggregate to set the premium for a 
certain plan, but for a particular plan, there can be no variations in premiums 
among employees of a particular organization. And if the insurer offers insurance 
coverage to several organizations, it can vary premiums among employers. 
 Adverse selection in insurance markets can result in some types of plans not 
being offered in the marketplace at all. For example, risk-averse individuals may 
prefer nearly complete coverage, but when there is adverse selection, such policies 
may not be available in the marketplace. 
 Adverse Selection and Unraveling in Insurance Markets 
 Adverse selection is not unique to private health insurance markets. It exists in 
other insurance markets as well. A very well-known exposition of adverse selection 
and its effects is a theoretical article by  Michael Rothschild and Joseph Stiglitz 
(1976) . In this section, we apply some of the basic arguments in this famous article, 
using the market for health insurance as a case in point. Rothschild and Stiglitz ’ s 
analysis applied to all types of privately purchased insurance. 
 Assume initially: 
 
 
 All people are identical. Each person requires $800 of care if he or she 
becomes ill. 
 
 
 If the person becomes ill and receives treatment, he or she survives. 
 
 
 There is no moral hazard. For example, people do not change their consump-
tion of personal health care services because they have health insurance. 
 
 
 There are two insurance policies in the market, one offering a maximum 
payment of $600 for medical treatment and the other offering complete insur-
ance — $800 worth of coverage. 
 
 
 The premium  difference of the two policies is $60 per year or $5 per month, 
reflecting differences in expected loss between the two policies plus an addi-
tional load reflecting the added cost of administering the higher limit policy. 
 
 
 The additional load represents the minimal added cost of providing the more 
complete coverage. 
 
 
 The choice between two policies is made by the individual based on the 
individual ’ s risk aversion. 
 
 
 The load on the insurance policies is efficient — that is, the amounts that 
would prevail in a perfectly competitive insurance market. 
 Given these assumptions, a person buys more complete coverage if willing-
ness to pay for the extra coverage is greater than or equal to the marginal cost of 
supplying it ( MC =  EL + load). The expected loss ( EL ) is independent of the person ’ s 
degree of risk aversion. Thus, even if the insurer had all possible information about 

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 151
people it insures, it would not charge different premiums except to reflect the limits 
on coverage ($600 versus $800 maximum payment in the event of an illness). 
 In deciding between the policy with the lower maximum or the higher 
maximum payment limit, the question for the consumer is only whether or not the 
extra $60 is worth it, given his or her own risk preferences. Those who are more 
risk averse may find the $800 limit policy more attractive, but this depends on 
precisely how risk averse the person is. 
 If the world were as simple as depicted above,  Rothschild and Stiglitz ’ s (1976)  
contribution would lie in describing the complexity of insurance markets with 
asymmetric information and the adverse effects of such asymmetric information. 
 Above, there was only one type of person with a probability  Θ of an illness 
occurring during the year (  fig. 4.5 ). There could be many such persons. The impor-
tant point is that there is no difference in expected loss, only in the degree of risk 
aversion  
 Now assume that there are two types of persons, one person having a higher 
probability of becoming ill: the one with the lower probability having a probability 
 Θ L and the one with a higher probability having a probability  Θ H of becoming ill 
( fig. 4.6 ). The  L -type consumer might have a different genetic makeup as reflected 
in a different family history of disease than does the  H -type. But the insurer does 
not know which type of genetic makeup each person has. The insurer does not 
know the difference between  Θ L and  Θ H but rather assumes that the individuals are 
equally likely to become ill, and just uses the probability  Θ in calculating the pre-
miums it charges for the two plans. 
 Assume that there are an equal number of  L -type and  H -type persons. Hence, 
 Θ = ( Θ L +  Θ H )/2. The insurer charges both individuals the same $60 difference in 
premium. 
Θ
 Figure 4.5 
 Adverse Selection: Only One Health Type of Person 

152 
 Part I / Chapter 4
 Under these circumstances, the person with the adverse family history picks 
the $800 coverage policy. The  L -type person picks the more limited $600 coverage 
policy (  fig. 4.7 ). During the year covered by the policies, the insurer notices that it 
is making money on the $600 policy and losing money on the $800 policy. For this 
reason, the next year the insurer sets the premium  difference  between the two types 
of policies at $80 (  fig. 4.8 ). 
 To continue, we need a finer distinction among types of individuals based 
on their true probabilities of becoming ill. Assume that there is further heterogene-
ity in the high-probability category, there being two types,  HL and  HH , with  HH 
having a higher probability of becoming ill than  HL .  
 Now  HH  picks the $800 plan, but given the higher premium difference,  HL -
type persons opt for the $600 plan. Next year the premium must rise even more. 
 HH -type people continue to opt for the $800 plan. Again the premium difference 
rises until there are few if any policyholders in the high-option plan. 
 Since policyholders are assumed to be equally risk averse, the choice of insur-
ance policy is always made on the basis of policyholder ’ s expected loss and the 
premium difference. But after rounds of premium increases and increasingly 
higher-risk persons selecting the high-option plan, the high-option plan eventually 
becomes unavailable in the market. There is virtually no one left to choose it. 
 One could conclude from this that it is just tough luck for the high-option 
plan. After all, the market for automobiles priced at over $100,000 (US$) is thin. 
On the other hand, many people would conclude that a high-option health insur-
ance plan is not really the equivalent of a $110,000 automobile. Not having com-
plete health insurance available will penalize highly risk-averse individuals who 
absent the unraveling process would want such insurance.

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 153
 To continue the above example, some individuals who would have been 
willing to pay for the more complete coverage are priced out of such coverage. In 
the end, they purchase $600 coverage when they would have preferred the $800 
coverage if it were available at (their)  EL + load. 
 In the real world, insurance policies differ in many ways, not just in dollar 
limits on coverage. Some policies offer additional benefits (e.g., cover more visits 
a year, cover more drugs). Some policies, as in the example, have a higher ceiling 
on dollar outlays per year or per life. Some policies have lower co-pays than others. 
Some policies offer lower deductibles than others. Some policies offer more choice 
of physicians (i.e., cover the services of more physicians). 
 But the general conclusion is the same. Under adverse selection, some types 
of high-option coverage may become unavailable in the marketplace because of a 
process analogous to the health insurance example described above.

Insurer observes an $80 difference

because EL for the higher-risk
person is almost (less load) $80
higher than for insuring the low-risk

to $80 per year.

 Adverse Selection and Unraveling: The Case of Harvard 
University 
 Cutler and Reber (1998)  described how unraveling occurred in Harvard University ’ s 
health insurance benefit offering. One case study alone does not establish that 
adverse selection and unraveling are empirically important phenomena in the 
United States and in other countries with private health insurance markets. But 
the Harvard experience serves to illustrate the concepts. 
 As background for this case study, we start with a brief description of the 
history of health insurance in the United States. Before the 1930s, there was essen-
tially no private health insurance market. People paid for personal health care 
services out of pocket. During the depths of the Great Depression of the 1930s, 
there are stories of patients who were farmers paying for a doctor ’ s visit with 
chickens in lieu of cash, which such patients often did not have. 
 Some of the insurance plans that evolved in the 1930s paid health care pro-
viders on the basis of the provider ’ s accounting cost, with the patient paying next 
to nothing out of pocket. Other plans paid a fixed dollar payment per unit of service 
such as for a doctor ’ s visit, with the patient generally paying out of pocket the dif-
ference between what the insurer paid and the physician ’ s fee. Still other plans 
paid a percentage of the doctor ’ s usual fee (often 80 percent) after a deductible was 
exceeded (say, $100). 
 During World War II, when employers faced a shortage of workers owing in 
part to the large number of men who enlisted in the armed forces and wage controls 
imposed by the government, employers increasingly began to offer health insurance 
coverage through the workplace as a way to attract employees. Further, as noted 
above, the US government did not tax employer-provided health insurance. 
Employer outlays for such insurance were considered a cost of the employer doing 
business; nor were such outlays subject to individual personal income taxation. 
 This generous tax policy undoubtedly contributed to the growth of employer-
based group health insurance in the United States. For many employees, the tax 
benefit was worth more than the load included in health insurance premiums. 
Under such circumstances, employees would want as many goods and services 
covered by insurance as possible, including services that the individual was sure 
he or she would use in the forthcoming year. 
 Particularly given the generous tax policy, health insurance plans became 
ever more generous. In general, employers at first offered only one plan to all 
employees. US law required that the provision be the same for all employees, 
irrespective of their level of compensation. When employers started to offer more 
than one plan, employers tended to subsidize the more expensive plans more, with 
the result that high-option plans cost the employee about the same in terms of the 
amount deducted on a regular basis from the paycheck as did lower-option plans. 
There was a definite financial incentive for employees to select higher-option 
health insurance plans when they were given this choice. 

156 
 Part I / Chapter 4
 Employer outlays for health insurance continued to increase in the US. Up 
to a point, both employers and employees were satisfied with this situation, even 
if a large part or all of the added outlays resulted in lower take-home pay for 
employees ( Pauly 1997 ). 
 As employer outlays for employees ’ personal health care services continued 
to rise and reached a certain point, employers began to question the wisdom of 
their practices. Harvard University, a large employer in the Boston area, was no 
exception. 
 Harvard University experienced the same types of problems as did many 
employers in the United States. Harvard offered several health insurance plans and 
subsidized the more costly ones. Then in 1995, Harvard changed to making a fixed 
dollar contribution to each plan it offered, with the employees paying the differ-
ence if they selected a higher, more costly option plan. 
 The most generous plan was a preferred provider plan (PPO) offered by Mas-
sachusetts Blue Cross-Blue Shield. The PPO option offered coverage of care pro-
vided by  “ preferred providers, ” those providers with contracts with the plan, as well 
as  “ non-preferred providers, ” who did not have contracts with the plan. Patients 
paid more out of pocket if they obtained services from the latter type of provider. 
 The theory underlying the change to a fixed dollar subsidy made a lot of 
sense. Now, given employee free choice but being responsible dollar for dollar for 
the difference between the lowest-cost option and the one they chose, employees 
would become price-conscious shoppers. They would realize that high-option 
plans with associated high amounts of moral hazard (and welfare loss from moral 
hazard) might not be for them, and such persons would opt for plans with lower 
premiums. 
 However, the Achilles ’ heel of a program of this sort was adverse selection. 
Having free choice of provider is logically more attractive to persons with serious 
chronic illnesses. After all, if you knew you had cancer, you would be interested 
in being treated by the best among the cancer specialists, and such specialists may 
not be affiliated with a particular health plan. (Health maintenance orga nizations, 
or HMOs, generally only cover care provided by physicians in their provider net-
works. PPOs, by contrast, provide partial coverage for care provided outside their 
networks, but they provide more coverage if care is obtained from a member of the 
PPO ’ s physician or hospital network. Chapter 11 provides further discussion of 
HMOs and managed care more generally.) For lesser conditions, obtaining care 
from the best physician may not make much difference to the outcome. 
 What happened after 1995 followed the pattern of the above health insurance 
example. Out-of-(employee)-pocket premiums for the Blue Cross-Blue Shield PPO 
plan kept rising and employee enrollment in the plan kept falling, to the point that 
Harvard stopped offering the plan to employees as an option. 
 Were employees made worse off as a result? The answer is probably  “ yes. ” 
Clearly, the sick employees who could no longer take advantage of Harvard ’ s cross 

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 157
subsidy of the higher-cost health plans were made worse off, but others were made 
worse off as well. Among these were employees who lived in parts of the Boston 
area far from the locations in which providers with contracts with the plans that 
continued to be offered had their offices and clinics. Also, risk-averse persons who 
would be willing to pay for the type of insurance offered by the PPO if the premium 
reflected only their expect loss plus an efficient load were made worse off. 
 Cutler and Reber (1998)  performed a welfare calculation of the net benefit of 
switching from a system in which a proportion of the cost of each plan was sub-
sidized, with the result that higher-cost plans were subsidized more, to a fixed 
dollar contribution per health plan that required the Harvard employee to pay the 
difference if the employee selected a higher-cost plan. They estimated savings of 
5 – 8 percent of baseline spending by Harvard University on the health benefits it 
offered employees. 
 These savings came at least in part from introducing a system in which 
employees had a greater incentive to be conscious about the costs of their health 
care. As a result, the Harvard health plans monitored provider behavior more care-
fully, installed new information systems, and denied payments for certain (presum-
ably low-benefit) procedures. At the same time, there was a welfare loss from 
risk-averse employees not being able to enroll in the PPO, which amounted to 2 – 4 
percent of baseline cost. Some risk-averse employees were no longer able to join 
the PPO, which they would have preferred. 
 Overall, the efficiency gains offset the welfare loss, implying that the switch 
to fixed dollar per employee contributions was worthwhile for Harvard University 
to undertake. Cutler and Reber estimated that the savings to Harvard (5 – 8 percent 
of baseline spending) were greater than the welfare loss from adverse selection (2 – 4 
percent of baseline spending). 
 Cutler and Reber made another important but somewhat subtle point about 
their welfare analysis. As a result of increased competitive pressures — after the 
change in policy, employees had a financial incentive to select less expensive 
health plans — Harvard ’ s health plans bargained more aggressively with health care 
providers in the Boston area and obtained contracts offering the providers lower 
pay. Unless the quantity and quality of services were adversely affected by these 
actions, the savings from obtaining lower pay from providers amounted to a transfer 
payment from hospitals and doctors to the plan, Harvard, and its employees, not 
an efficiency gain. Consumers gained and providers lost. 
 Empirical Evidence on Adverse Selection in Private Health 
Insurance Markets 
 Theory and one case study do not demonstrate that adverse selection in health 
insurance markets is generally an important phenomenon in the real world. To see 
whether or not adverse selection is important in the real world, it is necessary 
to turn to the empirical evidence.  Cutler and Zeckhauser (2000 , 617 – 621) provided 

158 
 Part I / Chapter 4
a comprehensive table of studies offering empirical evidence on adverse selection 
in health insurance. With one exception, the vast majority of studies listed are 
based on data from the United States. Of the thirty-two studies listed in their 
review, only five did not find empirical evidence of adverse selection in plan 
choices. However, a quite rigorous, more recent study using data on single employed 
individuals who responded to the National Medical Expenditure Survey, a national 
survey of utilization of and expenditures on personal health services in the 
United States, by  Cardon and Hendel (2001)  did not find evidence of adverse 
selection. 
 The one non-US article reviewed by Cutler and Zeckhauser is a study by  van 
de Ven and van Vliet (1995 ) from the Netherlands. That study used survey and 
claims data from the largest Dutch insurer, Zilveren Kreis. In the Netherlands since 
almost 1975, in an attempt to deal with adverse selection, there has been increasing 
differentiation of premiums for individual health insurance. Premiums differ by 
age, gender, family size, health status at time of enrollment, and health habits 
(smoking, drinking, exercise), and there is a bonus system reflecting the person ’ s 
past claims. Persons with no claims experience a reduction in premiums ( van de 
Ven, van Vliet, Schut, et al. 2000 ). Sophisticated methods have been developed for 
estimating premium subsidies so that persons in poor health can pay for risk-rated 
insurance policies ( Stam, van Vliet, and van de Ven 2010 ). We discuss risk adjust-
ment later in this chapter. 
 We review three additional studies of the experience outside the United 
States here, both of which find empirical evidence for adverse selection.  Savage 
and Wright (2003)  studied demand for private insurance for hospital care in Aus-
tralia, a country with a public hospital system but with private hospitals that offer 
shorter queues — that is, a shorter time to admission to the hospital — as well as 
higher amenity care, such as nicer hospital rooms. Savage and Wright found some 
evidence that persons with adverse health conditions are more likely to demand 
private insurance for hospital care. However, since the study did not indicate the 
extent to which premiums for such coverage or the underwriting policies of insur-
ers (i.e., willingness to insure particular types of persons) varied by health status, 
it is unclear whether adverse selection was truly present in this market. 
 Sapelli and Vial (2003)  evaluated the extent of adverse selection in the 
Chilean health insurance market. As in Australia, there is a public as well as a 
private system. Sapelli and Vial concluded that the public system obtains patients 
who are less healthy on characteristics observable by the insurers (and researchers). 
By contrast, on nonobservable health variables, which can potentially lead to 
adverse selection, they found empirical support only for adverse selection for 
hospitalizations. The authors concluded that private insurers in Chile do not in 
general face adverse selection. 
 Wang, Zhang, Yip, et al. (2006)  examined adverse selection in the context of 
a subsidized private insurance plan in a poor rural area of China. Although the 

Demand for Private Health Insurance 
 159
subsidized plan achieved a 71 percent rate of enrollment, a substantial share of the 
population eligible for the plan, persons in worse health were more likely to enroll. 
 To combat adverse selection, the plan set the household as the enrollment 
unit. Presumably one member of the household would be in especially poor health, 
and the utilization experience of the entire household would be more nearly rep-
resentative of utilization by families overall. However, nearly a third of households 
enrolled only some household members. Adverse selection was likely among these 
partially enrolled households. 
 These more recent studies and ones we do not describe here indicate that 
adverse selection  may  exist in any context in which health insurance is voluntarily 
purchased. Whether or not adverse selection exists in any particular situation is 
highly context-specific. One needs to analyze each case separately. Insurers can 
adopt subtle practices to protect themselves against adverse selection. We discuss 
these subtle practices further below. 
 Finally, two recent US studies did not find evidence of adverse selection in 
health insurance markets. One analyzed choices made in the Medigap health insur-
ance market ( box 4.2 ) and the other studied decisions about whether or not to 
obtain private insurance for long-term care services, nursing home, hospice, and 
care provided to disabled persons in the home (  box 4.3 ).

 Advantageous Selection in Markets for Private Health Insurance: Evidence from the US Medigap Insurance 
Market 
 Conventional asymmetric information models, such as the one by  Rothschild and 
Stiglitz (1976) , assume one-dimensional private information and predict a positive 
correlation between insurance coverage and ex post realization of loss. In the Roth-
schild-Stiglitz framework, the private information is about the probability of experi-
encing a loss during the period covered by the insurance policy. But individuals may 
have private information about other motivations for purchasing insurance, and these 
motivations may lead to people one would not normally expect on the basis of prob-
ability of loss to purchase complete insurance coverage. In fact, private information 
about these other motivations may lead to advantageous as opposed to adverse 
selection. 
 Fang, Keane, and Silverman (2008 ) examined sources of advantageous selection 
in the US Medigap insurance market. Medigap is private health insurance that covers 
services not covered by Medicare, as well as cost-sharing obligations Medicare 
imposes on beneficiaries. The advantage of studying Medigap is that insurance poli-
cies are standardized by the US government, making features of individual Medigap 
policies easy to compare. 
 The authors regressed total medical expenditure in a year on a binary variable 
(have Medigap = 1, do not have Medigap = 0) and other explanatory variables. They 
found that when not controlling for the individual beneficiary ’ s health status, those 

160 
 Part I / Chapter 4
Box 4.2
(continued)
with Medigap incurred annual expenditures on personal health care services that 
were about $4,000 lower than did those without Medigap. However, controlling for 
health status, beneficiaries with Medigap incurred annual expenditures $1,900 higher 
than those who did not have Medigap coverage. This latter result implies advanta-
geous, not adverse, selection. The authors investigated sources of advantageous selec-
tion. One key hypothesis was that persons who purchase Medigap insurance are more 
risk averse than others. This would make sense, given the analysis of risk aversion 
presented in the text of this chapter. However, the higher expenditures associated 
with having a Medigap policy were only slightly changed once the authors included 
an explanatory variable for the individual ’ s risk preferences. 
 Another possibility the authors investigated was whether Medigap policyholders 
differed in cognitive ability. Cognitive ability may act as a source of advantageous 
selection via its effect on individuals ’ information about health risks. Cognitively able 
individuals may be more knowledgeable about potential health risks, and therefore 
may be more likely to purchase Medigap. The authors found that among the factors 
explaining why Medicare beneficiaries purchase Medigap policy, cognitive ability is 
particularly important. 
 Clearly, the existence of adverse selection in insurance markets is not a foregone 
conclusion. There may be differences in the extent of adverse versus advantageous 
selection even among various health insurance markets.  
 Box 4.3 
 Selection in the Market for Private Long-Term Care Insurance in the United States 
 Finkelstein and McGarry (2006 ), studying the private long-term care insurance market 
in the United States, documented the importance of multidimensional heterogeneity 
among potential purchasers of insurance, which was also described in box 4.1. Using 
longitudinal data on individuals who were age 70 and older at baseline, the authors 
found a statistically insignificant correlation between long-term care coverage in 1995 
and the use of nursing home care during 1995 – 2000, even after controlling for insur-
ers ’  assessments of a person ’ s risk type. The evidence could be consistent with  “ no 
asymmetric information ” or  “ multidimensional information. ” 
 The survey they used asked in 1995,  “ What do you think are the chances that you 
will move to a nursing home in the next 5 years? ” Persons giving a higher probability 
in response to this question were more likely to have been in a nursing home after 
the survey through 2000, but they were also more likely to have purchased long-term 
care coverage. Although health can to some extent be observed by the insurer, the 
response to a question about the person ’ s beliefs about entering a nursing home in 
the foreseeable future can only be known to the person. The person in applying for 
an insurance policy will have to answer questions about his or her health truthfully

 “ Risk Adjustment ” and Adverse and Preferred 
Risk Selection 
 In a country with a single-payer system that offers no choice of health plan and 
applies to everyone, adverse selection is not an issue (see chapter 12). However, 
in countries in which choice of health plan is a matter of individual choice, adverse 
selection may exist even if having health insurance coverage is mandatory and 
health insurance premiums are subsidized. For example, in Germany, persons with 
earnings below a certain threshold must be covered by a statutory health insurance 
plan (sickness fund). However, they are free to choose among plans, and different 
plans charge different contribution percentages, or shares of employee compensa-
tion that the employer and employee must pay in equal amounts to the health plan. 
 In the United States, under Medicare, beneficiaries can select standard fee-
for-service Medicare, the beneficiary ’ s default choice, or they can enroll in a Medi-
care HMO if an HMO plan is offered in the beneficiary ’ s geographic area. Medicare 
provides a per enrollee subsidy if the beneficiary enrolls in a Medicare-qualified 
HMO. This subsidy is based on beneficiary demographic characteristics and loca-
tion, but it is not based on beneficiary health status. 
 Not surprisingly, given the heterogeneity in health among persons with the 
same broadly defined demographic characteristics, HMOs that enroll US Medicare 
beneficiaries are eager to attract individuals who are relatively healthy. Here the 
health plans rather than the beneficiaries are the main actors, and the phenomenon 
is  preferred risk selection  (also called advantageous risk selection). With preferred 
Box 4.3

and completely, but as a practical matter, it is difficult for an insurer to obtain infor-
mation about an individual ’ s aversion to being in a nursing home or lack thereof. 
After controlling for objective measures of the person ’ s health, what is left in the 
question about the probability of entering a nursing home in the next five years is 
information about individual preferences, which is private. Further, they found that 
while risk-averse persons were more likely to have private long-term care insurance, 
they were actually less likely to enter a nursing home during 1995 – 2000. 
 The bottom line is that observing health characteristics is not enough to know 
whether or not a person will be a high utilizer in the future. In this application, risk 
aversion affects demand for insurance, as the theory would lead us to have expected, 
but this does not translate into high rates of utilization of long-term care. 
 This important study provides even more evidence that the presence or absence 
of adverse selection must be examined on a case-by-case basis. Generalization to all 
private insurance markets is itself a risky proposition.  

162 
 Part I / Chapter 4
risk selection, insurers employ subtle techniques to attract persons who are likely 
to be less costly to insure. Insurers can influence who wants to join their plans by 
locating their facilities in geographic areas where beneficiaries are likely to be 
healthier, not retaining the best physicians in fields in which treatment is costly, 
not affiliating with major university hospitals that offer highly specialized care, 
and other approaches to  “ cream skimming. ” 
 To counter the incentives HMOs have to  “ cream skim, ” that is, to market 
themselves to and enroll the lowest utilizers of personal health care services, a 
public health insurance program might do well to risk adjust its per enrollee 
subsidy so that the subsidy reflects health status as well as demographic charac-
teristics and beneficiary place of residence. 
 Glazer and McGuire (2000)  described how US Medicare and other govern-
ments that subsidize health insurance plans can do a better job based on health 
data on individuals that are available to health plans. Various approaches for risk 
classification have been developed that can also be of use, but no single method 
is foolproof ( Frank, Glazer, and McGuire 2000 ;  Robinson 2008 ). 
 Ideally, it would be possible for a government agency to require that persons 
eligible for its program stick a finger in a meter that would accurately record all 
aspects of the person ’ s health. However, no such meter has been developed, and it 
is therefore necessary to deal with imperfect substitutes, such as claims data sub-
mitted by health care providers to insurers, which contain information on the 
insured person ’ s diagnoses and services rendered during the patient encounter. No 
single method of risk adjustment is foolproof ( Iezonni 1997 ). 
 4.10 
 Summary and Conclusions 
 In the end, how one views the adverse selection problem depends on how one 
views the appropriate structure of health care financing and delivery more gener-
ally. In contexts in which people are not given a choice of health plans, such as in 
single-payer systems, adverse selection is not an issue. On the other hand, if one 
views the role of government in a quite limited way, such as mainly providing a 
safety net for the poor, with others being asked to fend for themselves in the private, 
adverse selection is not much of an issue either. 
 In the long run, absent government intervention to preclude it, insurers can 
develop effective methods to combat adverse selection. For one, they can refuse to 
renew insured individuals who prove to be costly in any policy year. Insurers can 
ask for medical records prior to enrolling an individual. An issue for societies to 
decide, however, is whether or not active attempts by private insurers to skim the 
market conforms to the society ’ s social norms. A middle course is to improve risk 
adjustment from time to time and  “ grin and bear ” adverse selection in the interim. 

Demand for Private Health Insurance

 To the extent that it exists in health insurance markets, the adverse selection 
issue is not unique to such markets. For example, why do almost new cars sell for 
much less than brand-new cars? George  Akerlof (1970)  reasoned that new cars are 
of two types, good cars and  “ lemons. ” While the two types look alike, the owner 
knows from experience that his or her car is repair-prone. Hence, those  “ pre-
owned ”  cars that are put up for sale are disproportionately lemons. Although 
prospective buyers may not be able to detect a lemon by inspecting it, they are 
only willing to purchase such cars if they are able to do so at a discounted price. 
 When it exists, insurers can combat adverse selection in various ways, includ-
ing refusing to renew the health insurance policies of persons who used substantial 
amounts of personal health services during a year, refusing to cover preexisting 
conditions, and applying blanket refusals to accept persons with certain health 
characteristics or other characteristics judged by insurers to be positively correlated 
with adverse selection. However, these practices may be viewed by society as 
inherently unfair. Statutes outlawing such practices have often been enacted for 
this reason. However, when the law is too strict, insurers may not be willing to 
supply health insurance. 
 Another option when adverse selection is perceived to be quantitatively 
important is to eliminate insurance choices by statute. But this approach has dis-
advantages as well, in particular not recognizing diversity of preferences among 
individuals. Moreover, a dose of choice and competition in insurance markets may 
be a good thing. Competition ferrets out those sellers who do not provide a product 
that buyers want or who are inefficient suppliers. 
 Group health insurance provided through employment is still another option. 
Since people select employers for several reasons, health insurance being only one, 
employer provision of health insurance is a potential solution to adverse selection. 
But over time, again to satisfy diverse preferences among employees, employers 
have offered several plan options. This opens the door to adverse selection, espe-
cially when coupled with a policy of fixed dollar contributions, as Harvard Uni-
versity decided to do. 
 In the end, there is no simple answer. Economists can only offer options with 
trade-offs.

 The Market for Physicians ’  
Services 
 Physicians are the captains of the health care team. Physicians provide three dis-
tinct types of services. First, they provide advice to their patients about disease 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, including referrals to other sources of per-
sonal health care services and prescriptions for drugs that could not be purchased 
by the patient without a physician ’ s recommendation. Second, physicians them-
selves perform preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic services. Third, physicians 
certify the presence of illness and disability to other parties. Certification of a dis-
ability is typically required before a person can receive compensation for a dis-
ability or coverage for particular services under a health insurance policy. Although 
there are partial substitutes for physicians, for some tasks, the only substitutes are 
other physicians. 
 Economists often make a conceptual distinction between the  “ long run ” and 
the  “ short run. ” In the short run, at least one factor of production is fixed. In a 
model in which capital and labor are the two factors of production, in the short 
run, capital is assumed to be fixed but labor varies. In the long run, both capital 
and labor vary. In the context of physician supply, short-run decisions relate to 
physician decisions about pricing, hours of work, and the number of patients seen 
per unit of time, as well as the mix of patients seen, where the term  “ mix ”  reflects 
the composition of patients according to insurer type in countries with multipayer 
systems, as well as composition with respect to types of medical problems for 
which patients are seen. 
 Long-run decisions include decisions about entry and exit from practices of 
various types. These decisions involve choices about medical school capacities, 
the career decisions of students — the decision to become a physician, specialty 

172

choice, and practice location, including choice of country of practice and choice 
of geographic location within a country — and the choice of practice type, such as 
whether to work for the government or to be in private practice, and if so, whether 
to practice alone or in a group. All of these can be seen as long-run decisions. The 
choice of practice type and location are somewhat shorter-run  “ long-run ”  decisions 
than are occupational choices and choice of specialty. 
 In economic models, an assumption is typically made that economic agents 
are forward-looking. Thus, for example, in much the same way that expectations 
about the future influence health behaviors (see chapter 2), knowledge that physi-
cians ’  fees will be fixed at a low level by price controls is expected to influence 
students ’  career decisions. Forecasts of growth in demand for care are likely to 
influence decisions medical schools make about the number of students they 
admit. Thus, the short and long run are inextricably linked. However, the vast 
majority of medical schools are run by governments or private nonprofit organiza-
tions. Casual empiricism suggests that medical school capacity often responds to 
anticipated demand, but there are no formal economic models of medical school 
decision making. There are models that forecast future demand for physicians. The 
remainder of this chapter is organized around long- and short-run decisions in the 
market for physicians ’ services. 
 5.1 
 Medical School Capacity and Concepts of 
Physician Shortage and Surplus 
 Policy discussions of impending shortages and surpluses of physicians are 
closely linked to decisions about medical school capacity. Starting a new medical 
school typically involves years of planning. Given the length of the medical 
education process, it takes years after a student is first admitted to medical school 
until the supply of practicing physicians is affected. Because the lag between deci-
sions about capacity and the effect on supply is so long, medical school planners 
need to be forward-looking and face many uncertainties in their planning 
activities. 
 Outside economics, surplus and shortage are typically measured relative to 
a measure of  “ need ”  (see chapter 8 for a discussion of these concepts in the context 
of professional nurses). To an economist,  “ need ” is not a useful concept. We know, 
for example, that two people who are identical in terms of their health are likely 
to use health care services at highly different rates for various reasons, including 
personal preferences and wealth. 
 In the framework used by economists, prices adjust until markets clear, that 
is, until market forces lead to a price at which the quantity demanded is equal to 
the quantity supplied. If the price is below the market-clearing price, there is excess 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 173
demand or a  “ shortage, ” and if price is above the market-clearing price, there is 
excess supply or a  “ surplus ”  (  fig. 5.1 ).  
 Before dismissing the noneconomic concept of shortage and surplus 
entirely, let us consider the rationale for this concept. First, medical education is 
expensive, and the expense is borne to a considerable extent by the public at large. 
If physician fees dropped to a certain level, some physicians might decide to 
become taxi drivers. This might be acceptable if the cost of medical education were 
fully borne by the medical student, but it is much less so when public subsidies 
finance medical education, the much more usual case. Second, in a perfectly com-
petitive market, consumers are fully knowledgeable about the products they 
consume. 
 But in this context, there is the issue of asymmetric information we have 
already described — physicians knowing more about medical technology than their 
patients do. There is a widespread concern, particularly among noneconomists, 
that when facing a surplus, physicians may  induce demand  for their services. For 
example, when one revisit may be appropriate, a physician who is paid on a fee-
for-service basis might recommend more than one revisit because it is in the physi-
cian ’ s financial interest to do this. And the unknowing patient would conform to 
this recommendation by keeping the appointment. 
 Even if physicians do not generate extra demand, more physicians are likely 
to make medical care more accessible. With more physicians, patient travel time

is likely to decrease as physicians locate in more remote areas, waiting time to an 
appointment may fall, and physicians may spend more time with each patient. 
Lower travel time reduces the full price of care (see chapter 3) and hence increases 
the quantity of physicians ’ services demanded. Higher quality, perhaps in the form 
of longer visits, may be expected to increase demand and spending on physicians ’ 
services as well. Of course, whether the higher expenditures result from physicians 
providing more highly beneficial care to patients or reflect higher utilization rates 
with low marginal benefit to patients makes a big difference. 
 Partly because of reservations about the applicability of the conventional 
supply-demand model to medicine, various commissions charged with making 
recommendations about the future need for physicians forecast need based on 
projections of future population and its demographic composition. More sophisti-
cated analyses project frequencies of various types of diseases the future population 
is likely to have. Forecasted need is then compared to forecasted supply, which 
reflects the number of medical school graduates, net inflows into or outflows of 
graduates from the country, and projected rates of retirement from practice, as well 
as losses to activities other than the practice of medicine (e.g., research, teaching, 
administration, careers outside medicine). 
 The predictions from these projection models have often proved to be quite 
inaccurate. In the United States, in the 1980s, a high-level commission predicted 
there would be a surplus of physicians in that country by the year 2000. By any 
measure, this surplus never materialized, and more recent predictions are for an 
emerging physician shortage in the United States ( Cooper 2004 ). 
 Whatever number of students medical schools accept, the number of appli-
cants tends to be far greater than the number of acceptances. Particularly in view 
of the public expense, medical schools desire the admission process to be selective. 
As explained by  Friedman and Kuznets (1945) , the motive for limiting medical 
school capacity may be to boost physician incomes. They attributed high physician 
incomes to such entry barriers. This view seems to fit the United States better 
during years in which medical school capacity was very limited — after about 1910 
following the Flexner Report, which led to the closing of many US medical schools, 
to about 1970 than in more recent years. 
 5.2 
 Physician Supply in the Long Run 
 Choice of Medicine as a Career 
 Without denying the importance of nonmonetary incentives, economists have 
tended to focus on responses to monetary incentives as motivators of occupational 
choice. But economists recognize that nonmonetary factors are important as well. 
For example, in the context of career choice, economics is clear that if aspects of 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 175
a job are undesirable, pay must be increased to compensate the employee for the 
undesirable factor. These are  “ compensating wage differentials. ” 1 
 Before presenting the empirical evidence, it is useful to think about career 
choices in conceptual terms. We start with the notion that for each individual  i 
and each career alternative  j , there is a stream of anticipated future earnings ( Y ij ) 
and nonmonetary attributes of the occupation ( A j ). Among the nonmonetary attri-
butes are the occupation ’ s prestige, its intellectual content, the types of people one 
interacts with, the flexibility of the work schedule, the risk of injury, and job-related 
stress. 
 Values of  Y ij vary not only by  j but also by  i because people have different 
earnings potential in different types of work. There are innate differences among 
people in physical and mental abilities and in their personalities. Further, indi-
viduals differ in the utility that they attach to earnings and the nonmonetary attri-
butes of the job. 
 Let  U i  =  U i ( Y ij ,  A j ). 
(5.1) 
 People derive utility from consumer goods and services that they can pur-
chase from their earnings and from the nonmonetary attributes of each 
occupation. 
 Y ij and  A j are substitutes. A higher level of anticipated earnings can compen-
sate an individual for accepting work in an occupation with a lower  A j . Since the 
value of adding an additional unit of  A j (the marginal utility of a unit of  A j ) differs 
among individuals, people will require different compensating earnings differen-
tials to make them equally well off if they select an occupation with a lower  A . 
Suppose, for example, that some people place a high value on having a flexible 
work schedule, and work flexibility can be thought of as an index varying from 
 “ very inflexible ” to  “ very flexible, ” while others attach little importance to such 
flexibility. If the career generally demands an inflexible work schedule, holding 
other factors constant, the person who values a flexible schedule will require a 
higher earnings differential to offset the utility loss from having to work irregular 
hours or hours during which the person faces other demands on the person ’ s time, 
such as for child care. As another example, some people may be attracted to a 
career in which there is a lot of interaction with other people. Others might want 
to work alone. For the latter type, a substantial amount of interpersonal interaction 
with patients is a  “ bad. ”  For sociable persons, such interpersonal contact is a 
 “ good. ”  Bads are offset by higher earnings, and conversely for goods. 
 Now suppose that the career options are medicine or becoming a college 
professor. College professors have flexible work hours while physicians often do 
not. Then for the individual who values flexible hours, anticipated earnings will 
need to be higher in medicine than in college teaching for the person to be attracted 
to a medical career. Depending on the nonmonetary attribute and the individual ’ s 
1.  See, for example, 
 Nicholson (2008 ) for 
a discussion of 
compensating wage 
differentials in the 
context of medicine.

176 
 Part II / Chapter 5
utility function, that is, how much the individual values (or dislikes) a unit increase 
in the attribute, the compensating earnings differential could be positive or 
negative. 
 Following this reasoning, one can imagine that some persons are attracted to 
medicine at a very low level of anticipated earnings, which may be far below the 
level of earnings in the other occupations the person is considering. These are 
individuals who place a very high value on the nonmonetary attributes of being a 
physician — possibly the prestige or the satisfaction gained from helping patients. 
Other individuals are less strongly motivated by the nonmonetary attributes and 
are more motivated by money, which can be used to purchase goods and services. 
For these persons, to be attracted to a medical career, anticipated physician earn-
ings can be lower for those who attach greater value to such nonmonetary attributes 
of a medical career. 
 This heterogeneity in preferences explains why the supply curve for a given 
occupation is likely to be positively sloped. When the pay level is relatively low, 
people who place a high value on such nonmonetary attributes of the work are 
attracted to the occupation. But to attract others, pay must rise (  fig. 5.2 ).  
 Earnings in an occupation are determined by both the demand for and the 
supply of persons to the occupation. The demand curve for any input, including 
an hour of a person ’ s time devoted to work in an occupation, reflects both (1) the 
contribution of a unit of the input to additional output — the input ’ s marginal 
product (MP) — and (2) the contribution of additional output to additional revenue 
or marginal revenue (MR). Thus, the employer ’ s maximum willingness to pay for 
a given quantity of the input is the product of MP and MR, or the marginal revenue 
product (MRP). An increase in MP, for example from a technological change that 
makes physicians more productive (e.g., a medical information system), shifts the 
demand curve for physicians outward. Equilibrium earnings are determined at the 
intersection of the supply and demand curves. As shown in   figure 5.2 , for equilib-
rium earnings  E *, the corresponding employment is  L *. 
 The equalizing earnings differential between the two occupations depends 
on where the MRP (or value of the marginal product, which is the product of MP 
and the product price if the product market is competitive) crosses the supply curve 
for each occupation. Characteristics of jobs that are unattractive to potential entrants 
shift the supply curve to the left, and good ones shift it to the right. Of course, 
there is heterogeneity among individuals in valuations attached to specific charac-
teristics associated with occupation. One may think of the supply curve as the 
amount needed to bribe person to enter the occupation — the more that is consid-
ered  “ bad ” about the occupation, the higher the bribe must be (  fig. 5.3 ).  
 The theory of equalizing earnings differentials, or equalizing after accounting 
for nonmonetary characteristics of jobs, assumes free entry into occupations. In 
fact, of course, entry into medical school is not free. In the United States in recent 
decades, there have been two to four times more applicants than are accepted by 
medical schools.

 Part II / Chapter 5
 In a study using US time series data for the years 1934 – 1966,  Sloan (1971)  
found that the number of applicants to medical school in the United States was 
positively related to physician earnings but negatively related to medical school 
tuition — tuition being the price of medical education. In every year, the number of 
applicants far exceeded the number of places in first-year classes of medical 
schools; 2 the number of applicants increased in years in which the probability of 
acceptance increased. He also reported that students with A averages in colleges 
were less responsive to monetary incentives than were those with B averages, 
perhaps because a greater proportion of the A students selected medicine to pursue 
an academic career rather than to enter private medical practice. To our knowledge, 
there are no more recent studies of this issue. 
 Physicians make several important decisions about their careers: (1) whether 
or not to become a physician, (2) choice of specialty, (3) geographic location, and 
(4) type of practice (e.g., independent solo, group, or salaried practice). Several 
pertinent questions are the following: (1) How important are financial incentives 
in the choice of medicine as a career, choice specialty, and practice location? (2) 
How do physicians select practice types, and in turn, how do the incentives associ-
ated with each affect physician incentives? These questions are important in every 
country. 
 Physician Choice of Specialty 
 In contrast to the choice of medicine as a career, there are numerous studies of 
choice of physician specialty by medical students. Many studies focus on the role

of changes in the internal rate of return or present value of earnings streams in 
various specialties on specialty choice. For this reason, we begin with a description 
of these concepts. 
 Concept of Present Value 
 Let  PV j be the present value of returns net of the cost of an investment in training 
in occupation  j and  i be the market rate of interest,  R jt be earnings in year  t ,  C jt 
be the cost associated with the investment in training for occupation  j in year  t , 
 n be the number of periods (years) in which the person expects to be active 
in the occupation  j , and  S jn the value of the sale of the asset at year  n , for example, 
the sale of a physician practice, a subsidy provided to the person at retirement.  3 
Then 
 PV j = ( R j 1  –  C j 1 )/(1 +  i ) + ( R j 2  –  C j 2 )/(1 +  i ) 2 + ( R j 3  –  C j 3 )/(1 +  i ) 3 . . . 
+ ( R jn  –  C jn )/(1 +  i )  n +  S jn /(1+ i) n 
(5.2) 
 The investor undertakes the project if  PV j is positive or zero. If  PV j is negative, 
the project is not undertaken. If the investment is a building or research on a new 
drug (see chapter 9), there is conceptually no limit to the number of investment 
projects that can be undertaken. However, for investments in human capital, the 
investor can generally select only one investment. For example, the person chooses 
to become either an engineer, or a lawyer, or a physician. Thus, the decision maker 
takes the  PV j of each alternative occupation into consideration in making the 
choice. 
 In a competitive capital market and one in which the risk of default on the 
loan does not differ among individuals, the value of  i is fixed at some constant 
value. Holding other factors constant, if the interest rate rises,  PV j falls, and con-
versely for a decrease in the interest rate. 
 In markets for human capital, the assumption of competitive capital markets 
and uniform default risk is unlikely to hold, for several reasons. Most important, 
a substantial amount of investment in human capital comes from family savings 
and the earnings of family members. There is likely to be substantial heterogeneity 
in the value households attach to a dollar of funds allocated to educational invest-
ments. In particular, for capital-starved households, the value attached to such 
funds may be substantial and is likely to increase with the amount invested. In 
economic terminology, the marginal cost of funds is the cost of raising a dollar of 
funds as a function of the amount of funds raised. For example, if the person raises 
$ x for a investment, the cost of raising the last dollar may be  C . The cost of raising 
$ x + 1 may be  C ′ , where  C ′  >  C (  fig. 5.4 ). Scholarships and grants for education 
lower the cost of capital for education, shifting a positively sloped marginal cost 
of funds to the right.  
3.  This framework is 
described in detail 
in  Becker (1964) .

180 
 Part II / Chapter 5
 Concept of Internal Rate of Return 
 The internal rate of return on an investment is the internal rate  r , which makes the 
present value of the right-hand side of equation 5.2 zero. 
 0 = ( R j 1  –  C j 1 )/(1 +  i ) + ( R j 2  –  C j 2 )/(1 +  i ) 2 + ( R j 3  –  C j 3 )/(1 +  i ) 3 . . . 
+ ( R jn  –  C jn )/(1 + i)  n +  S jn , 
(5.3) 
 where  n shows the time horizon relevant for the project ( n = number of periods). 
 If the value of  r which satisfies equation 5.3 is greater than or equal to the 
marginal cost of funds or  i — the assumption here being that the marginal cost of 
funds does not vary with the size of the investment — the project is undertaken. If 
this  r is less than the marginal cost of funds, the project is not undertaken. For 
careers, a person can accept only one  “ project. ” The choice of projects is mutually 
exclusive. 
 An application of these concepts is  Weeks, Wallace, Wallace, et al. (1994) , 
who computed costs and returns in alternative careers, including medicine, as well 
as returns to specialization within the medical field in the United States for the 
year 1990.  4 The authors compared returns and costs in several occupations: busi-
ness, law, medicine, and dentistry. Within medicine, the authors computed profit-
ability of investments in primary care specialties, such as pediatrics, general or

family medicine, and general internal medicine, and in procedure-oriented special-
ties, such as radiology and general surgery. 
 For cost, the authors measured tuition and fees in each year the person was 
engaged in the educational process, length of training, and the opportunity cost of 
being in school. If the person was not in school, it was assumed that the individual 
would have earned the amount equivalent to that of a high school graduate who 
was employed on a full-time basis. For returns, the authors generally used median 
earnings in the occupation or specialty by age group. 
 As is usual in this type of study, the authors used cross-sectional earnings 
data. The underlying assumption is relative earnings by age in an occupation or 
specialty will remain unchanged in decades to come. Hours of work per week differ 
by occupation and among the physician specialties.  5 For physician specialties, the 
study accounted for length of residency programs assuming completion without 
interruption. The authors wanted to control for grade point averages in occupations 
at entry, but data were not available. The rationale for adjusting for grades is that 
entry into some types of professional training is much more competitive than it is 
for others. To the extent that physicians earned higher grades before entry into 
medical school than did others who entered training for other careers, earnings 
differentials between medicine and other occupations may be overstated since 
persons who become physicians may have greater motivation to work and greater 
ability, which would have resulted in relatively high earnings if they had entered 
the other occupations as well as medicine. To the extent that this is so, observed 
differences in earnings between medicine and earnings in other occupations may 
be overstated. 
 The authors used different interest rates to discount future earnings of alter-
natively 0.05, 0.07, and 0.10. These rates are higher than long-term real interest 
rates on riskless securities, which are about 3 percent. A rationale for using a rate 
higher than for riskless securities is that the earnings stream is likely to be risky. 
Earnings in many occupations are subject to considerable variation. Weeks and 
coauthors begin their calculations after the person graduates from high school. 
Thus, year 1 is the first year of college. The first year of medical school in the 
United States is year 5. 
 The internal rates of return on investments in selected occupations or special-
ties were as follows: business, 0.29, law, 0.25; dentistry, 0.21; procedure-based 
medicine, 0.21; and primary care medicine, 0.15. Thus, although the rate of return 
of 0.15 for primary care was far above interest rates that have prevailed in the 
United States in most of the past century, it was much lower than the 0.21 for 
procedure-based medicine. Even procedure-based medicine returns were lower 
than returns for business and law.  6 A principal difference between medicine and 
business and law is that the length of training is much shorter in business and law 
on average than in medicine. And even though policy makers have stressed the 
importance of attracting more trained personnel into the primary care medical 
5.  To eliminate this 
source of variation in 
earnings, the authors 
ad justed earnings for 
differences in hours of 
work by occupation/
specialty. Particularly 
since it is not possible to 
account for the many 
other differences among 
the occupations and 
the specialties, it is 
questionable wheth  er 
the hours-of-work 
ad justment should 
have been made.
6.  Procedure-based 
specialties include 
radiolo gy, diagnostic 
cardiology, and surgical 
specialties. In such 
fields, the main focus 
is on performing 
procedures rather than 
on providing medical 
advice to patients and 
maintaining the health 
of patients over the 
longer term. Physicians 
in procedure-oriented 
specialties tend to earn 
more than their 
colleagues in primary 
care specialties.

182 
 Part II / Chapter 5
fields, returns on education in procedure-based fields remained appreciably higher 
( table 5.1 ).  
 As an alternative to the rate of return calculations, Weeks and coauthors 
showed the results of their present value calculations by occupation/specialty. 
Ranked in terms of highest present value to lowest using an interest rate of 0.05, 
the ranking was as follows: procedure-based specialty medicine, law, dentistry, 
business, and primary care medicine. Using an interest rate of 0.10, the relative 
ranking of present value between dentistry and business reversed. However, pro-
cedure-based medicine remained at the top and primary care medicine at the 
bottom. Overall, investments in professional education yielded substantial finan-
cial rewards (  table 5.1 ). 
 The relatively brief training periods in law and business increases rates of 
return in these occupations. Given the assumed interest rates in the present value 
calculations, all of which are far below the estimated rates of returns, the present 
value estimates are far less sensitive to lengthy training periods than are the rates 
of return calculations.  Weeks and Wallace (2002) , using 1997 data, updated the 
earlier analysis (which was based on 1990 data), finding that primary care physi-
cians remained at the bottom in terms of rate of return on their education. However, 
among the professional groups studied, primary care medicine realized the largest 
percentage gain in net present value of all the groups. Primary care remained at 
the bottom despite policy initiatives implemented to encourage entry into primary 
care during the 1990s. 
 The higher earnings in procedure-based than in primary care fields of medi-
cine are not unique to United States. For example, Lin, Kao, Tang. et al. (2005) 
documented a similar pattern in Taiwan, a country with public national health 
insurance. In Taiwan, the national health insurance program controls the amount 
and rate of remuneration of physicians (see chapter 12).

 Nicholson (2008 ) summarizes rates of return from physician specialty train-
ing. The returns on training in some procedure-oriented specialties, such as anes-
thesiology and radiology, exceed 1.0, which is equivalent to a 100 percent return 
on a dollar invested in training in these specialties. These high rates of return occur 
from a combination of much higher earnings in these fields than in family practice 
and the relatively short residency training periods in these fields. At least in the 
United States in the latter part of the twentieth century, there were definite finan-
cial incentives for physicians to specialize in certain fields. 
 Based on an analysis of students ’ earnings expectations,  Nicholson (2005)  
reported that medical students underestimate physicians ’ earnings. The median 
student underestimated physician earnings by 15 percent between 1974 and 1998, 
and the median absolute value of the estimation errors (considering both under- 
and overestimates of earnings) was 26 percent of actual earnings. Although stu-
dents ’  assessments were relatively inaccurate and downward biased, accuracy 
improved by 35 percent between the first and fourth years of medical school. Spe-
cialty choice is likely to be made during the third and fourth years of medical 
school. 
 To the extent that earnings differ appreciably among physician specialties, 
do earnings differences systematically affect choice of specialty? As discussed more 
fully in  Nicholson (2008 ), some studies find that rates of return on specialty train-
ing have virtually no impact on specialty choices, while at least one study finds a 
substantial effect. A difference is that the studies showing no effect used data on 
actual patterns of entry, while the study with the large effect used students ’ desired 
specialty choices as the dependent variable. The difference between the two is that 
limits on openings in specialty training programs can constrain students ’ actual 
choices. One would expect that admission to specialty training would be especially 
tough in those fields for which the rate of return is relatively high, unless, of course, 
specialty boards, which control entry, allow the number of positions to increase 
when admission becomes increasing tough to gain. In fact, such boards appear not 
to increase slots sufficiently to meaningfully decrease the difficulty of entry. One 
study estimated that about half of the differential in earnings between primary care 
and non-primary care physicians is due to entry barriers in latter ( Bhattacharya 
2005 ). 
 While economists, starting with  Friedman and Kuznets (1945),  have main-
tained that entry barriers in medicine are motivated by the collective financial 
self-interest of the medical profession, physicians point to justifications for high 
financial returns on medical education and to high returns in some specialties that 
are not financially motivated. For example, one reason advanced for limiting capac-
ity in residency programs (hospital-affiliated specialty training programs for 
medical school graduates desiring to enter a specialty) is that residents in a spe-
cialty should perform a minimum number of procedures during their training in 

184 
 Part II / Chapter 5
order to become proficient in these procedures; without limits on program size, 
there may not be a sufficient number of patients to provide adequate training 
opportunities. A related issue is that if there are too many practicing physicians 
in a particular specialty, the volume per specialist may be insufficient for the spe-
cialist to maintain his or her skills, and quality of care would suffer as a result. 
Limits on specialty training capacity plausibly reflect both financial and nonfinan-
cial motives. 
 Physician Geographic Location Decisions 
 A major public policy issue in virtually all countries concerns the maldistribution 
of physicians geographically. In large cities, there are often many physicians. By 
contrast, there are few physicians relative to population in many rural areas, even 
though the population is far smaller there. There are substantial differences in 
physician availability in large cities as well, with physicians being less plentiful 
in areas of the city where predominantly low-income families reside.  7 
 A simple economic model of the spatial distribution of firms predicts that 
physicians in a given specialty will tend to locate so as to equalize their patient 
loads. Assuming constant demand per person, if there are twice as many physicians 
in one location than in another, there will be twice as many physicians in the 
specialty in the former than in the latter location ( Newhouse, Williams, Bennett, 
et al. 1982 ). Below a certain population threshold, there will be no specialists of a 
given type in a community. The threshold depends on the total number of special-
ists in the market. 
 Suppose, for example, there are 100 physicians to be allocated to various 
geographic locations in a country. The population size is 100,500. Further, the 
100,500 people are distributed in three locations, one with a population of 80,000, 
another with a population of 20,000, and a third with a population of 500. Assum-
ing that physicians will locate to equalize the physician-to-population ratios in the 
three locations, the largest town will get 80 physicians, the second largest 20, and 
the third town, no physicians. Now suppose the number of physician increases to 
210. In equilibrium, there will be slightly fewer than 500 patients per doctor. The 
smallest community will now get a doctor. Thus, there is a case for increasing 
the country ’ s total physician supply in order for the smallest communities to have 
their own physicians. 
 However, increasing aggregate supply is an inefficient approach to solving a 
maldistribution problem. First, for the least populous community to obtain one 
physician, it is necessary for physician supply in the two larger communities to 
more than double. 
 The above framework assumes that physicians are indifferent about where 
they locate. Yet in reality, communities vary in their nonfinancial attributes (e.g., 
quality of schools, libraries, recreational opportunities), and physicians and their 
families are likely to prefer some communities to others for this reason. Given

the distribution of 
gen eral practitioners

described by  Shannon 
and Cutchin (1994) .

heterogeneity in preferences of persons who enter the medical profession, one 
option is to select medical students who are likely to prefer a particular geographic 
location. For example, students who have families in rural areas may prefer to live 
there, holding other factors constant. Or to the extent that physicians like to locate 
near large bodies of water or in the mountains, it may be desirable to attract stu-
dents who have lived in areas far from water and mountains under the presumption 
that many such persons like living in such areas. 
 Second, the above framework assumes that per capita demand for physicians ’ 
services is constant. However, per capita demand is higher among persons with 
health insurance coverage and high incomes. Thus, if the small community in the 
above example is also relatively poor, it may not attract a physician even if 
the aggregate supply rose to 210. 
 Third, the above framework does not explicitly consider the possibility that 
physicians will locate strategically. If population density differs within a market, 
a physician may locate so as to be near a population cluster and hence, attract 
disproportionately large amounts of patients within the cluster. For example, a 
physician would locate in between two population clusters rather than outside 
one. 
 Rosenthal, Zaslavsky, and Newhouse (2005 ) studied geographic location pat-
terns of physicians in the United States between 1979 and 1999, a period during 
which aggregate physician supply in this country nearly doubled. For most special-
ties studied, there was a diffusion of physicians to smaller communities as aggre-
gate supply increased. However, in specialties with relatively few physicians, the 
smallest communities still lacked a physician in 1999. 
 The authors cautioned that physician-to-population ratios may not be fully 
accurate measures of individuals ’ access to a physician. Gauged in terms of travel 
time to a physician in a particular specialty, access in nonmetropolitan areas adja-
cent to major metropolitan areas was higher than in nonmetropolitan areas distant 
from large cities. 
 The Economics of Physician Group Practice 
 Another set of choices physicians face is the type of organization in which they 
will practice. In some countries, many physicians practice in groups that are inde-
pendent of other organizations, such as hospitals. In the United States, market 
changes are leading greater numbers of physicians to select employed practice, 
such as hospital employment. However, independent practice remains the 
predominant practice arrangement. Group practice offers a number of potential 
advantages. 
 Economies of Scale and Scope 
 First, being in a group may allow the physician to exploit economies of scale and 
scope.  Economies of scale  are realized when unit cost decreases as output increases. 

186 
 Part II / Chapter 5
Often such economies arise because the initial investment of capital is spread over 
a larger output as output increases. Examples are medical equipment, such as a CT 
scanner or a computer system for medical records or patient billing. Another source 
of economies of scale is that larger firms may have more market power in markets 
for inputs they purchase. 
 Economies of scope  exist when the provision of one type of output makes it 
possible for another type of output to be produced more efficiently. Suppose, for 
example, that a radiologist practices with a general surgeon. There may be efficien-
cies in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer if a rapid and accurate diagnosis can 
be followed by a timely surgical procedure. With technological change in com-
munication, however, some sources of economies of scope may have lessened. For 
example, a radiologist in India may interpret a scan obtained in the United States, 
while the surgeon sleeps, and the interpretation may be available for the surgeon 
the next day. 
 Referrals 
 Second, a motive for young physicians to join a group practice is to build practice 
volume by gaining referrals. There may be gains from trade between more estab-
lished physicians wanting to reduce practice volume and newer physicians wanting 
to build it. By practicing together, the referring physician can share in the patient 
revenue from the referred patients that would be likely to occur if the practices 
were separate. A young physician may gain from a revenue-sharing arrangement 
initially, but as he or she gains experience with the practice, this physician may 
be expected to subsidize other, less experienced colleagues. Some physicians join 
groups to be able to practice medicine rather than spend a lot of time in business 
management. Income pooling with other physicians in the practice provides a form 
of insurance against the risk of reductions in income in a particular year. 
 Coverage of Patients 
 Third, many physicians select group over solo practice because this arrangement 
offers coverage of patient emergencies during nights and weekends. Coverage is 
particularly useful in such fields as obstetrics. Babies want to be delivered nights, 
weekends, and holidays, as well as during normal business hours. 
 Reduction in Earnings Fluctuations 
 Fourth, group practice tends to result in reduced fluctuations in earnings, a situa-
tion likely to be preferred by risk-averse physicians. Physicians in groups may be 
paid in several ways. One option is salaried practice. In this case, the group receives 
fee-for-service revenue, but employed physicians receive a fixed salary. Within a 
time period, such as a year, there are no fluctuations in salaried physician earnings. 
While this may appeal to risk-averse physicians, salaried physician practitioners 
do not have a direct financial incentive to be concerned about either practice cost 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 187
or revenue. For this reason, practice cost may be higher and volume of service 
lower than it would be if the physician faced financial incentives to be efficient 
and to exert effort. Another option for group practices is expense sharing. Accord-
ing to this arrangement, physicians share practice expenses, but each physician 
receives his or her billed revenue. Particularly if by incurring additional expense, 
the physician can generate more revenue, there is an incentive to incur additional 
expense. Without any monitoring of individual physician behavior, each physician 
has an incentive to incur extra expenses, especially when the group size is large. 
 To see this, suppose that 100 physicians in a group share expenses. Then, 
assuming equal expense sharing, the cost to an individual physician of adding a 
dollar in practice expense is only $0.01.  8 For this reason, expense-sharing practices 
are likely to have some type of monitoring of individual physicians to oversee 
individual physician use of practice resources. 
 More typically, physicians in groups share revenue as well as expense. The 
practice ’ s tax on individual physician revenue may vary from ( N  – 1)/ N , where  N 
is the number of physicians in the group, to other arrangements in which revenue 
shares vary with various factors, such as the amount of revenue generated by the 
individual physician. 
 Even in a two-physician equal revenue- and expense-sharing practice, mar-
ginal revenue from seeing patients is cut in half. This plausibly reduces individual 
physician effort. Fortunately, with as few as two partners, observing the other 
partner ’ s effort should not be that difficult. Nor should it be as difficult to agree to 
mutually beneficial levels of effort. With a much larger group, however, monitoring 
the effort of individual physicians and agreeing on rules regarding levels of indi-
vidual physician effort are likely to be more difficult to achieve. But a larger group 
offers the individual physician more risk protection from negative shocks to 
revenue. 
 Empirical Evidence 
 In a study of group practices in the United States,  Gaynor and Gertler (1995)  
hypothesized that (1) more financially risk-averse physicians join groups and (2) 
physician groups place more emphasis on reducing financial risk to individual 
group members ( “ risk spreading ” ) and correspondingly less emphasis on providing 
financial incentives for individual physician effort. Using data from a large cross 
section of physician practices of varying sizes and compensation arrangements, 
Gaynor and Gertler found that compensation arrangements with greater revenue 
sharing significantly reduced individual physician effort. When physicians were 
not rewarded for extra effort at the margin, they saw fewer patients. This mattered 
especially when the number of physician group members was large. At the limit, 
revenue and expense sharing reduces individual physician incentives to the point 
at which the individual physician member gains virtually no additional income 
from seeing an additional patient, as occurs in salaried practice. Physicians in 
8.  See, for example, 
 Newhouse (1973) .

188 
 Part II / Chapter 5
Gaynor and Gertler ’ s sample with a greater taste for steady income selected salary 
compensation. The choice of a large versus a small group practice, a partnership, 
or solo practice involved a trade-off between risk protection in a large revenue- and 
expense-sharing practice and efficiency in a smaller practice. When, in addition, 
economies of scale and scope are also considered, the trade-offs become more 
complicated. Other research from Canada shows that physicians have higher output 
when they are organized on a fee-for-service basis than on a salaried basis ( Ferrall, 
Gregory, and Tholl 1998 ). 
 5.3 
 Physicians ’ Short-Run Decisions 
 Overview 
 Now we assume that the physicians are in place, and we describe the market for 
physicians ’  services, conditional on choices of occupation, specialty, location, and 
practice mode having been made. This separation is made for analytic convenience. 
In practice, people make personal choices with long-run implications. Thus, physi-
cians forecast prices and outputs and profits (incomes) in various settings well or 
not so well and make specialty, location, and practice type choices accordingly. 
 The market for physicians ’ services is often cited as a case in which standard 
economic analysis does not apply (  box 5.1 ). Policy decisions often are based on a 
premise of failure in the market for physicians ’ services (  box 5.2 ). 
 Some public policy makers and some scholars reach this conclusion for 
several reasons. First, there is the impression that people do not know much 
about medical care and the production of health. For this reason, the assumption 
of perfect information, which underlies the perfect competition framework, is 
questioned. 
 Second, higher-income individuals sometimes pay higher fees than those 
with lower incomes, seemingly for the same quality of service. Unless the price 
differences are positively related to quality differences, this may be an indication 
of price discrimination ( Kessel 1958 ). Under perfect competition, sellers do not 
possess the market power to price discriminate. 
 Third, not only is there variability in physicians ’ fees within small geographic 
areas but fees tend to be  higher in areas with higher ratios of physicians to popula-
tion. It is argued that if competitive forces operated, fees would generally be lower, 
not higher, in such areas. 
 Fourth, a point related to the second, expenditures on physicians ’ services 
appear to be higher and expenditures per physician not that much lower or lower 
at all in areas with higher numbers of physicians per capita population ( Schwartz, 
Williams, Newhouse, et al. 1988 ). If so, medical organizations have no real financial 
motive to lobby for barriers to entry to protect their incomes.

 Box 5.1 
 Is the Market for Physicians ’ Services Really Unique? 
 The tripartite role described in this chapter ’ s introduction is not unique to physicians. 
An automobile mechanic, for example, might determine the need for a repair and 
then offer to perform the repair. Mechanics may certify that an automobile is in good 
condition. Similarly, lawyers perform at least two of the roles, as do insurance adjust-
ers. Lawyers may assess the merits of a potential client ’ s legal claim and then, 
conditional on the client agreeing to this, represent the client ’ s legal interests. An 
insurance adjuster may assess the damage caused by a storm to a house and estimate 
the amount of money needed to repair the damage. As with physicians and lawyers, 
the underlying assumptions are that the adjuster is competent and trustworthy and 
that the estimate includes the materials and labor needed to restore the house to its 
condition before the storm occurred. 
 In all of these markets, consumers know less than the professionals do. The patient 
knows less about medicine than the physician does, the automobile owner knows 
less about transmissions than the mechanic, the client knows less about law than the 
lawyer, and the homeowner knows less about the cost of materials and labor than 
the insurance adjuster. 
 How can one be sure that the physician or other professional or business is suf-
ficiently trustworthy? One approach is to rely on competitive forces. For example, 
following an instance of poor performance, such as lost luggage on a flight, the con-
sumer may use another airline the next time. For many physician encounters, reliance 
on competitive forces may suffice. Suppose, for example, the physician seems 
distracted during a routine physical examination. The patient who had no illness 
detectible may select another physician subsequently without incurring major harm. 
For some products, such as automobiles, there are reliable sources of written 
information on frequency of repair, or for airlines on frequencies of late flights or lost 
baggage. Consumers can rely on this information as an accurate description of the 
product ’ s quality, and, based on quality and price, consumers can make informed 
product choices. 
 The competitive approach faces two challenges in the context of medical care. 
First, performance failures can sometimes result in serious harm. Of course, the same 
may be said for automobiles and airplanes that crash, but in some industries the 
consequences of performance failures (e.g., the failure of a few pages in a textbook to 
be printed) are plausibly less. Second, there are problems in rating the quality of 
individual physicians based on their performance records. A heart surgeon may 
experience a high death rate in performing heart surgery not because the surgeon is 
incompetent but because he or she operates on patients with difficult conditions who 
are at higher risk from surgery. Also, in contrast to automobile frequency-of-repair 
records, which may be based on hundreds of thousands of cars, the caseload of an 
individual physician may be too low to provide a reliable basis for evaluating the 
physician ’ s failure rate. Safety records are evaluated not on a pilot-specific basis but 
rather on the performance of all the airline ’ s pilots.  

190 
 Part II / Chapter 5
 Box 5.2 
 Policy Responses to Perceived Physician Market Failure 
 If reliance on competitive forces is misplaced, then what are the alternatives? One 
alternative is to rely on  professional norms . Professional norms are rules of behavior 
widely accepted by the profession. These rules may be enforced, but they are suffi-
ciently inculcated that members of the profession generally abide by the rules even 
if they are not enforced. 
 On graduating from medical school, physicians are asked to take the Hippocratic 
oath, which states they will put their patients ’ interest first. However, professional 
norms do not guarantee that quality will be maintained. After all, a physician may 
have a good attitude but not be competent. Physicians may not be most up-to-date 
about technical advances in their fields. 
 Other forms of self-regulation and external regulation allegedly designed to safe-
guard quality of care include medical school accreditation, licensure, and certification 
in a physician specialty. High-quality medical education may lead to high quality of 
care, but again, there is no guarantee. For one, a physician is likely to practice for 
forty years or so after graduation, and there can be substantial technological change 
(and some forgetting) over this period. Economists tend to be suspicious of licensure 
since the licensure process can be used to bar entry into the profession. In contrast 
to licensure, which is required for a physician to practice, certification indicates that 
the physician has certain educational preparation and has passed certain tests. A 
noncertified physician can still practice medicine or even perform services common 
to a specific specialty. But even certification does not ensure quality. In practice, few 
physicians are ever decertified. 
 Other quality assurance mechanisms in health care in the United States employ 
peer review at the level of the medical staff of a hospital (discussed in chapter 7) and 
by insurers. With hospital peer review, physicians on the medical staff determine who 
can have and retain privileges to practice at the hospital. In some rare cases, poor 
performance by a physician may lead to exclusion from the insurer ’ s network of 
physicians. 
 No method of quality assurance is foolproof. The method on which the vast majority 
of countries rely is to require that the physicians satisfy certain educational require-
ments and take an examination prior to becoming licensed. Worldwide, the capacity 
of accredited medical schools places an upper limit on physician supply. Many physi-
cians emigrate from the country from which they receive their basic medical educa-
tion. Thus, the supply in any country will depend on whether it experiences net 
inflows or outflows of physicians.  

The Market for Physicians’ Services

 Fifth, when the prices of physicians ’ services are set administratively, either 
by a government agency or by a private insurer, the quantity of physicians ’ services 
sometimes increases after the price is reduced. In  “ normal ”  markets, one might 
expect quantity decreases following a reduction in an administrative price.  
 A normal competitive market is characterized by many buyers and sellers; 
each buyer and seller is a price taker. No individual participant in a competitive 
market is able to affect price. Equilibrium price and quantity are determined at the 
intersection of industry supply and demand curves. In the sense that there are 
many buyers and sellers, the market for physicians ’ services resembles a perfectly 
competitive market. 
 In the market for an agricultural product such as oranges, which is a perfectly 
competitive product market, orange growers plant, fertilize, and harvest based on 
an anticipated price of oranges over which growers have no control. Similarly, food 
wholesalers, retailers, and ultimately consumers of oranges as individuals have no 
control over product prices. Rather, price is determined by the impersonal forces 
of supply and demand for oranges. If there is one quality level, then there is one 
price. If, by contrast, there are several qualities, there are different prices reflecting 
the different qualities. Price differentials reflect both the marginal cost of producing 
additional quality as well as consumer willingness to pay for products of different 
qualities. If, for example, orange growers employ extra fertilizer to obtain larger 
oranges, the growers must be able to recover the extra cost of the fertilizer in the 
prices they obtain from selling the oranges in order for them to invest in the fertil-
izer. Similarly, people need to be willing to pay more for larger oranges. 
 In sum,  “ normal ” markets provide a variety of quality levels. There is nothing 
in quality variation per se that necessarily impedes the workings of a competitive 
market. We observe differences in quality of hotels, restaurants, clothing, toys, and 
many other goods and services. 
 In some settings, physicians are price takers, but this occurs when health 
insurers set prices that physicians who care for patients with the insurers ’ coverage 
are often obliged to accept as payment in full. When physicians are price takers, 
the quantity of service often increases in response to administered price decreases. 
 In other settings, patients pay physicians directly on a fee-for-service basis. 
In such situations, the physician is often a price setter, not a price taker. Especially 
when physicians set prices for services, there is often substantial price dispersion 
for the same service in a given geographic area. Prices of physicians ’ services are 
often higher in areas in which there are more physicians. Normally, in a competi-
tive market, one would expect that an increase in supply would lead to lower prices. 
 Some of these stylized facts that seem to be inconsistent with a competitive 
market can be easily reconciled with economic theory. Other facts are less easily 
reconciled. We first see how far we can go in reconciling stylized facts of the physi-
cians ’ services market with standard economic models when (1) physicians ’ fees 
are set by market forces and (2) physicians ’ fees are set by a public or private 

192 
 Part II / Chapter 5
administrative organization. While individual physicians are price takers if the 
product market is perfectly competitive, they are also price takers when their fees 
are set by a government agency or a private insurer. 
 Reconciling Stylized Facts of the Physicians ’ Services Market 
with Standard Economic Models 
 Why the Demand Curve Facing the Individual Physician May Be Downward Sloping 
 As noted above, price differences can exist under perfect competition. But the dif-
ferences reflect differences in quality, and whether physicians who charge higher 
prices are really better physicians is questionable. It seems necessary to look at 
other explanations for price differences within geographic areas, such as within 
cities. 
 To the extent that the market for physicians ’ services is  monopolistically 
competitive  rather than  perfectly competitive , differences in prices for the same 
services, such as within a city, are readily explained. In monopolistically competi-
tive markets, each seller faces its own product demand curve. Price differentials 
among sellers in a market can persist in the long term. 
 In a perfectly competitive market, the demand curve facing the individual 
seller is flat. If the seller charges a price above the market-clearing price, the seller 
loses all customers. For example, a grower cannot sell an orange for any amount 
above the market-clearing price for oranges. There may be differences in prices, 
but this price variation is easily explained. For example, prices tend to be higher 
when oranges are sold at greater distance from where they are grown. If a seller 
has a large supply of oranges on hand, the seller may fear that the oranges may 
spoil sitting on the shelves and offer oranges for sale at a lower price than otherwise 
for this reason. 
 In a market in which perfect competition does not prevail, the demand curve 
facing the individual seller is downward sloping. The quantity demanded rises as 
price falls. In such markets, rather than supply the quantity at which marginal cost 
equals price, the quantity is set where the marginal cost equals the marginal 
revenue (  fig. 5.5a ). The price of all goods or services sold depends on the quantity 
supplied; the seller takes this into account in deciding how much quantity to 
supply.  
 Why might the physician ’ s demand curve be downward sloping rather than 
perfectly horizontal? First, search among doctors is costly for patients. If the patient 
is satisfied with a doctor, the cost of further searching may not be worthwhile. 
Thus, a patient may not leave his or her physician even if the physician ’ s price is 
slightly above another ’ s (but see   box 5.3 ).  
 A second reason to expect that physicians face downward-sloping demand 
curves is that people may be willing to pay more for the convenience of visiting a 
physician who is geographically closer to the patient. Thus, if a physician who is 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 193
10 miles away cuts his or her fee, a patient might be disinclined to switch from a 
physician who is located much closer. On the other hand, to attract patients from 
distant as opposed to nearby locations, the physician may have to offer services at 
a lower price. 
 Under  monopolistic competition , there are no important barriers to entry, and 
each seller ’ s demand curve is negatively sloped. Thus, as more (monopolistically 
competitive) sellers enter the area, the demand curve shifts in until each seller 
earns zero profits. The zero profit equilibrium is shown in   figure 5.5b , at point  C . 
 Why Are Physicians ’ Fees Often Higher in Markets with More 
Physicians? 
 The monopolistic competition model can explain why price dispersion may exist 
in a particular geographic area as well as among areas, but the model is not directly 
useful for explaining why physicians ’ fees are higher in areas with more physicians 
relative to population. 
 Practice Input Price Differences 
 One explanation for such fee differentials is that the costs of some inputs in the 
production of physicians ’ services are higher in areas in which physicians tend to 
be numerous. Since office space tends to be more costly in central cities than in 
the suburbs than in rural areas, some patients who work or live downtown or for 
whom downtown locations are geographically accessible may be willing to pay

 Box 5.3 
 Search, Experience, and Credence Goods 
 Economists distinguish among  search ,  experience , and  credence goods . Physicians ’ 
services are sometimes experience goods and sometimes credence goods, but rarely 
search goods. 
 For a  search good , it is possible to learn a lot about the good ’ s characteristics before 
purchasing it. Suppose one is considering the purchase of an automobile. There are 
numerous ratings of the car ’ s performance, durability, appearance, and other dimen-
sions of quality. Especially with the Internet, it is possible to compare the prices of 
alternative dealers. While one may learn something from a test drive of the automo-
bile, much information about specific automobiles can be gleaned from other informa-
tion sources. 
 By contrast, to assess an  experience good , the consumer must first consume a unit 
of the good. For example, before seeing a physician for the first time, a person does 
not know whether or not the physician is a good match for him or her. Once a con-
sumer has found a good match and the physician learns a lot about you and your 
health, changing to another physician and repeating the exercise may be quite costly. 
It seems unlikely that many patients would switch doctors just because the price of 
another doctor was slightly lower than one ’ s regular doctor. The presence of health 
insurance will also diminish the consumer ’ s incentive to change physicians. If a large 
part or all of the price difference is covered by health insurance, people should be 
much less responsive to price differences among doctors. 
 With an experience good, consumers are fairly knowledgeable about the seller after 
consuming it. There are some goods and services for which consumers are not well 
equipped to gauge quality,  credence goods . Advice is likely to be part of the service 
sought. Consumers do now know which quality of the good or service that they need. 
These are credence goods. Consuming the good requires faith. Clearly, attending 
church, synagogue, a mosque, or a temple requires an element of faith. But so do 
some rarely performed types of medical care. In such cases, it is hard to ask others 
about their experiences. Further, even if the person you asked has had a favorable 
experience, this may not be the case for you because of differences in genetic makeup 
or some other factor. With credence goods, goods for which attributes are difficult or 
impossible for consumers to evaluate, there is a concern that consumers are vulner-
able to self-serving behaviors on the part of suppliers. In the context of medicine, it 
is often difficult for patients to evaluate what the physician is doing or not doing. 
It is certainly difficult for a patient undergoing surgery to know what is going on. Nor 
is it possible for insurers and others outside the operating room to know precisely 
what happened there. The market may not provide sufficient incentives to deter such 
fraudulent behavior ( Dulleck and Kerschbamer 2006 ).

more to visit a physician who is located downtown. Particularly in large cities, 
geographic location could be an important source of price variation. This could be 
a reason that fees tend to be higher in the center of New York City (Manhattan) 
than in the suburbs, although the physician-to-population ratio is much higher in 
Manhattan. 
 The Pauly-Satterthwaite Model 
 Differences in office space cost may explain some price dispersion, but often dis-
persion in physicians ’ fees within cities is far greater than can be explained on the 
basis of space cost alone.  Pauly and Satterthwaite (1981) and earlier work by  Sat-
terthwaite (1979)  suggest another reason. 
 They argued that patient search cost is higher in large cities than in smaller 
cities or in nonmetropolitan areas. Higher search cost in turn is expected to make 
the demand curves facing individual physicians less elastic, surely less than infi-
nitely elastic. Demand is less elastic because if the physician were to raise prices, 
patients would have less information and would face higher search costs in learn-
ing about the prices of other physicians in the area. Holding other factors constant, 
price is higher when the demand curve facing the individual seller is less elastic.  9 
 Indeed, there is something to be learned from asking other people about their 
doctors. Pauly and Satterthwaite described the search process as follows. Suppose 
one were a new to a city and were a guest at a party. The guest would ask someone 
who has lived in the city for some time,  “ Do you know anything about Dr. Johnson? 
Is he a good doctor? ” If there are only one or two doctors in the town, the person 
would certainly be likely to know something about Dr. Johnson. But in a large city, 
it would often be necessary to ask many persons at the party about Dr. Johnson 
before finding someone who actually knew something about him. In this sense, 
search cost is higher in large cities, resulting in more inelastic physician demand 
curves and higher prices. 
 There are other questions that the newcomer could ask, and the answers to 
these questions would not vary by city size. For example, one could ask the person 
about his or her doctor or whether the person knows of a doctor he or she would 
recommend. If the line of questioning proceeded in this way, there would be no 
difference in search cost between a large and a small city. The Pauly-Satterthwaite 
explanation is interesting, but it does not fully resolve the issue of why physicians ’ 
fees are often higher in cities in which relatively many doctors practice relative to 
the city ’ s population. 
 The Quality-Amenities Model 
 In another framework, as more physicians enter a market, qualitative changes in 
the product occur. For example, waiting time in the physician ’ s office may decrease 
and physicians may spend more time with patients on average. Travel time to a 
physician from work or home may decrease.

how price is set by a

power in its product 
market here. We suggest

on microeconomics 
for an explanation.

 Part II / Chapter 5
 Nearly everywhere in the world, patients spend time in a waiting room before 
being seen by a physician. While they can be distressing to patients, such waits 
have an economic explanation, however. 
 If a physician were to maintain a zero wait time in the office, there would be 
times during which patients would be unavailable to be seen by physicians. Some 
patients may arrive late and others may forget they had an appointment. With many 
patients in the physician ’ s waiting room, it is less likely that the physician will be 
unoccupied because no patient is available. When physicians are more numerous 
relative to the number of potential patients in the market, physicians are more 
likely to wait, and conversely. An increase in quality should lead to an increase in 
price, both in perfectly competitive markets and in those with monopolistic 
elements. 
 When there are more physicians in a market, there is a greater heterogeneity 
of practice styles, including some  “ boutique practices. ” Such practices offer more 
professional time for patients and shorter waits, among other differences. But such 
boutique practices tend to charge higher prices ( Boardman, Dowd, Eisenberg, et al. 
1983 ). 
 The astute reader will see a definite parallel between the quality-amenity 
model and our depiction of the market for oranges above, a market we said was 
perfectly competitive. If in fact we could explain physician fee variation by varia-
tion in characteristics and this variation were not responsible for increased search 
cost, it would be appropriate to characterize the physicians ’ services market as 
competitive. 
 Summing Up 
 We now take stock of how well the standard models do in accounting for the 
stylized facts of the physicians ’ services market when price is set by market 
forces. 
 On the first, consumer ignorance, in the standard models, obtaining informa-
tion is costly to consumers, more so for some types of services than for others. It 
is easier to find out whether an obstetrician is a good doctor by asking others than 
whether a brain surgeon is good because relatively few people undergo brain 
surgery. In general, economists do not test the assumptions of their models but 
rather test the models ’ predictions. Hence, economists have little evidence to add 
directly to the debate as to whether or not consumer ignorance is truly widespread 
in markets for physicians ’ services. 
 On the second fact, economists explain that higher-income persons may 
purchase a higher quality of services, where quality includes but is not limited to 
such product attributes as waiting time and length of visit with the physician. 
However, we cannot know for sure whether or not quality differences fully 
explain the price differences observed with a market, the third stylized fact. On 
the fourth point, qualitative changes occur when physician density increases, and 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 197
it is conceptually possible that these changes may explain some of difference in 
expenditures on physicians ’ services among geographic areas, but there is insuf-
ficient evidence to conclude that such changes explain all or even the major part 
of the difference. 
 Reconciling Stylized Facts of the Physicians ’ Services Market 
with Standard Economic Models: Fees Set Administratively 
 Quantity Increases with Administered Price Decreases 
 In many countries, especially those with government-provided health insurance, 
individual physicians, practicing alone or in groups, have no or at most only very 
limited power to set prices. When there is public health insurance, price tends to 
be set by the government (see chapters 12 and 13). Also, large private insurers often 
dictate prices to individual physicians, who can either accept the price schedule 
presented to them or refuse to accept payment and patients from this payment 
source. The physician ’ s decision is then how much quantity of which types of 
services to provide to persons covered by the insurance plan. 
 Backward-Bending Supply Curve of Physicians 
 Initially assume that the physician produces one type of service and there is one 
insurer, which sets the product price. Under these assumptions, and because physi-
cian time is the major input in medical practice, we can analyze the physician ’ s 
response to price in terms of a model of labor supply. The concept of a supply 
curve is introduced here since it applies only when the firm is a price taker. If the 
firm sets its product price, economists generally assume that the firm ’ s decisions 
are guided by profit maximization rather than by utility maximization, the motiva-
tion assumed here. 
 In the usual model of labor supply, the individual decides how much labor 
to supply given the wage, which is exogenous to the individual. Here, since the 
physician ’ s wage rate is substantially determined by the administered price, we 
use wage and price interchangeably. 
 A reason for the negative relationship between prices and quantities pro-
vided — that is, quantity increases when the administered price is reduced — may 
be that the physician labor supply curve is backward bending or negatively-sloped 
throughout. The concept of a backward-bending labor supply curve comes from 
microeconomic theory. 
 Rewrite equation 5.1 as follows: 
 U i =  U i ( Y i ,l i ). 
(5.4) 
 According to equation 5.4, individual  i ’ s utility is a function of income or goods 
and leisure ( l i ). As the hours of work increase, leisure hours decline and utility 
falls. 

198 
 Part II / Chapter 5
 Y i = ( T  –  l i ) w +  Y o . 
(5.5) 
 The person ’ s income depends on the number of hours he or she works ( T  –  l i ), 
where  T is the total amount of time available to the individual to allocate between 
market work and leisure, and  Y oi is the other income the individual receives which 
is unrelated to work hours, such as from investments or public subsidies. In this 
framework, the individual ’ s decision problem is to find that level of  l i that maxi-
mizes utility subject to the constraint given by equation 5.5. 
 A decrease in the price of a physician ’ s service leads to a decrease in physi-
cian hourly compensation,  w . The trade-off between goods and leisure is given by 
the wage. Suppose that the physician has no other source of income and has a 
maximum of 80 hours per week to devote to work ( T = 80). (The rest of the 88 
hours in the week is presumably devoted to various personal activities, including 
eating and sleeping.) If the physician works 80 hours weekly, weekly earnings are 
80 w , where  w is the hourly wage. An increase in the wage raises maximum weekly 
earnings, and conversely for a decrease in the wage.  
 In   figure 5.6 , before the reduction in the price, the physician has  l A hours of 
leisure and can consume  G A units of goods and services. After the price decrease, 
the new equilibrium is  l B hours of leisure and  G B consumption units. Since  l A

exceeds  l B , this implies that the person works more hours at  B than at  A . Consump-
tion is lower at  B than at  A. 
 Underlying the change in leisure and consumption are two effects: a  substitu-
tion effect  and an  income effect . At a lower wage, according to the substitution 
effect, the reduced wage reduces the price of leisure, and for this reason, the physi-
cian works fewer hours per week. He  “ buys ” more leisure. However, assuming that 
leisure is a normal good — more of it is consumed at higher income levels — the 
lower wage induces the physician to work longer hours since the physician is 
poorer following the reduction in wage. If the income effect dominates the substitu-
tion effect, as shown in   figure 5.6 , a reduction in the administered price leading 
to a lower wage increases work hours. As work hours increase, the quantity of 
service provided increases.  10 
 Thus, according to standard economic theory, a reduction in an administered 
price could lead to an increase in hours of work and hence in output. However, 
does empirical research on physician work hours support a negative relationship 
between the physician wage and work hours? Actually, the empirical research 
conducted to date supports either a zero or a positive effect, not a negative effect 
of the physician wage on physician labor supply ( Sloan and Steinwald 1975 ; 
 Noether 1986 ;  Rizzo and Blumenthal 1994 ;  Showalter and Thurston 1997 ;  Baltagi, 
Bratberg, and Holm å s 2005 ). In sum, at least to date, there is no empirical support 
for the strong income effects that would lead physicians to provide more care fol-
lowing an administrative price cut. 
 Other Empirical Evidence on the Effects of Administered Price Reductions on 
Volume of Physician Services 
 There has been some empirical research on the effects of administered price 
changes on the quantity of services supplied. In a study of procedures  “ overpriced ” 
by the US Medicare program (thought to be priced well above marginal cost) for 
which Medicare reduced prices in 1990,  11  Nguyen and Derrick (1997)  found no 
statistically significant effect on volume of services following the price reductions 
overall, but for the 20 percent of physicians who experienced the greatest price 
reduction, the authors found that a 1 percent reduction in the administered price 
led to a 0.4 percent increase in volume of the procedure provided.  Yip (1998)  
studied overpriced Medicare procedures in New York and in the state of Washing-
ton in the United States and found that cuts in administered prices did lead to 
volume increases. 
 Summing Up 
 The concept of the backward-bending supply curve is useful for explaining physi-
cian supply responses to administered price reductions. While the theoretical 
concept is clear, the empirical evidence is not. Some studies show that administered 
price reductions increase volume of service, but many studies do not show this.

 Part II / Chapter 5
 Reconciling Stylized Facts of the Physicians ’ Services Market: 
Other Models 
 Target Income and Supplier-Induced Demand 
 Standard economic theory takes one only so far in explaining the important styl-
ized facts of the physicians ’ services market. A substantial number of health econo-
mists and probably the majority of researchers from other disciplines who study 
the physicians ’ services market maintain that standard economic models are inap-
propriate in this application. But if standard economic models do not do the job 
of explaining physician behavior, are the alternative frameworks really any better? 
 According to the target income (TI) hypothesis, physicians set price and 
output to achieve an income target ( Y Ti ). Setting aside practice cost (expenses 
incurred by the physician for nonphysician inputs, such as for receptionist pay, 
office rent, and utilities) to simplify the discussion and adding cost leads to no 
additional insights. Let  Y Ti =  p i  ×  x i , where  p i and  x i are the price and quantity set 
by physician  i . According to the TI hypothesis, if physicians become more numer-
ous relative to the population and hence  x i decreases, physicians raise  p i to achieve 
 Y Ti . This presumably can explain the observed fact that prices are often higher in 
areas with greater physician density (see, e.g.,  Fuchs 1978 ). 
 The TI hypothesis possibly can explain the positive relationship between 
the price of physicians ’ services in markets in which physicians have price-setting 
power and the existence of a relatively high physician-to-population ratio. However, 
the TI hypothesis suffers from two major flaws. First, it is not clear how the income 
target  Y Ti is set. There are many possibilities, probably too many. For example, a 
physician with more children might have a higher  Y Ti . A physician living in an 
affluent neighborhood might have a higher  Y Ti , as would a physician desiring to 
purchase an expensive sports car. 
 Second, there is an infinite number of combinations of  p i and  x i that can 
satisfy the target. Presumably, although not in the model, if leisure is valued by 
the physician, he or she would want to work as little as possible. Then why not 
set  x i at 1, letting price of a single unit of service be sufficiently high to achieve 
the target? In sum, the TI hypothesis does not make for a very satisfying theory of 
physician behavior. 
 An alternative to the target income hypothesis is the physician-induced 
demand hypothesis (PID), originally proposed by  Evans (1974) . In standard eco-
nomic theory, demand curves are stable. Perhaps they can be shifted outward by 
an advertising campaign, but at a minimum, shifting demand is costly. According 
to the PID hypothesis, information between physicians and patients is so asym-
metric that a physician can shift out the demand curve for his or her services when 
it is in the physician ’ s self-interest to do so. Shifting involves recommending a 
service such as a revisit or a surgical procedure whether or not the recommended 
care is of potential benefit to the patient. The key feature is that under PID, demand 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 201
is shifted in the physician ’ s interest not in the consumer ’ s. The only reason a con-
sumer would accept this situation is asymmetric information between doctors and 
their patients. 
 In a standard economic framework, the patient visits the doctor to obtain 
information and assumes the doctor will make recommendations that the patient 
would make if the patient were as knowledgeable as the doctor. A monopolist can 
select price-quantity combinations along a stable demand curve to maximize profits. 
 With PID, however, the physician presumably has this power (unless the 
payment system requires that the physician be a price taker), but in addition, 
patients do not learn from any source how to distinguish between beneficial and 
nonbeneficial or even harmful care, and therefore the physician can set the demand 
curve wherever he or she desires. 
 There is a potential constraint on demand inducement, namely, professional 
ethics. Because of professional norms or some other reason, a physician may feel 
guilty about shifting demand for financial gain, but being ethical is a normal good. 
If demand is pushed too low by an influx of physicians and demand per physician 
and income falls dramatically, ethics may be less of an impediment to demand 
inducement than if physician income is considerably higher. 
 In the work-leisure analysis described above, there are two arguments in the 
physician ’ s utility function: consumption and leisure. In the PID hypothesis, there 
are three arguments, consumption, leisure, and the physician ’ s ethics ( Evans 1974 ; 
 McGuire and Pauly 1991 ). Shifting demand outward is good for consumption in 
that there is additional income to purchase more goods and services, but it is bad 
for leisure since the physician needs to work harder if he or she shifts out demand. 
Also, ethical considerations militate against demand shifting. However, if con-
sumption is low, demand shifting is more likely. In the PID hypothesis, the quantity 
of services provided by each physician may increase following an administered 
price decrease. 
 Interestingly, to the extent that PID characterizes physicians ’ services markets, 
it is not limited to those cases in which physicians are paid on a fee-for-service 
basis. Under capitation, physicians may have a financial incentive to deliver less 
service than a well-informed patient would want to obtain. PID can exacerbate this 
problem. A physician could deliver even less care under capitation with PID than 
in the absence of PID. 
 Thus, depending on the method of physician payment, PID leads to either 
too much or too little care being provided. Further, the demand curves that are 
used in welfare analysis (see chapters 3 and 4) have no meaning under PID. By 
definition, if the patients ’ demand curves are easily shifted because patients lack 
the knowledge about the care they would benefit from, it is inappropriate to use 
demand curves as a measure of patient willingness to pay for care. 
 The PID model is less of a conceptual straw man than is the target income 
hypothesis. In an important paper,  McGuire and Pauly (1991)  showed in a 

202 
 Part II / Chapter 5
theoretical analysis that the TI is just an extreme case of the operation of income 
effects. At any income above the TI, a decrease in price does not affect physician 
supply. However, if price is reduced just a dollar below the target, physicians 
increase supply to reach the income target as they would in the backward-bending 
supply curve analysis described above. But, as noted above, the empirical evidence 
does not support strong income effects on physician labor supply. 
 Empirical Findings on TI and PID 
 Economic theory is important for providing a framework for analysis. However, 
empirical research is needed to gauge actual relationships among variables. We 
now turn to a brief review of empirical research on the PID hypothesis. 
 In assessing these results, several key points should be kept in mind. First, 
the fundamental question is not whether or not PID  ever exists. There can be little 
doubt that some PID exists, especially for credence-type medical services. Rather, 
the issue concerns the empirical importance of PID. How widespread is PID? And 
to the extent that it is widespread, which public policies are likely to be most suc-
cessful in countering it? 
 Several studies have been conducted by Jonathan Gruber and colleagues, 
using data from the United States. This research overall provides mixed evidence 
on the empirical importance of PID.  Gruber, Kim, and Mayzlin (1999)  focused on 
the choice of cesarean versus normal deliveries. The fee for cesarean sections tends 
to be higher than that for normal deliveries, and there is a concern that high cesar-
ean rates in the United States may reflect financial incentives facing individual 
physicians. In this study, the authors examined whether changes in the relative 
fees for cesarean sections and normal (vaginal) deliveries paid by Medicaid, the 
US public program financing care of the poor, affect the relative frequency with 
which cesarean sections and normal deliveries are performed. As explained more 
fully below, physicians are price takers if they participate in the Medicaid program. 
That is, if they accept Medicaid patients for care, they must accept Medicaid ’ s fee 
as payment in full. Physicians are free not to accept such patients. 
 Using the theory of the firm generally used by economists, there are no 
income effects. Thus, if the relative fee of cesarean sections falls, one would expect 
more normal deliveries. By contrast, under PID, one would expect a fall in the price 
of cesarean sections to lead to an increase in cesareans as physicians induce 
demand for such services to achieve and increase in income. The authors found 
that a decrease in the relative price of cesarean sections relative to normal deliver-
ies led to a decrease in the relative number of cesarean sections performed, evi-
dence against the PID.  Mitchell, Hadley, and Gaskin (2002)  reported similar results 
for physician responses to changes in the relative prices of ophthalmologic services 
paid under the US Medicare program. 
 Gruber and Owings (1996)  assessed whether or not the declining fertility rate, 
a 13.5 percent decrease in the US national fertility rate between 1970 and 1982, a 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 203
change that is not under obstetrician-gynecologists ’ control but one that would be 
expected to reduced their incomes, led to an increase in cesarean section deliveries 
(which are higher priced than normal deliveries), as the PID hypothesis would 
predict. The authors reported that cesarean sections rose as a consequence of the 
fertility rate decrease, evidence favorable to PID. A 10 percent decline in the birth 
rate led to a 3 percent increase in the cesarean section rate. 
 Early studies of PID (e.g.,  Fuchs 1978 ) interpreted evidence of a positive 
relationship between quantity of physicians ’ services provided and physician 
availability (the physician-to-population ratio) as evidence in support of PID. 
However, this positive association is evidence for both PID and standard economic 
models. In the latter, more physicians would be expected to enter a market in which 
there was more demand. Also, as physicians become more numerous, they are 
likely to be more accessible to patients; for example, they might locate their 
offices closer to where patients work and live, and demand would increase for this 
reason. 
 Dranove and Wehner (1994)  argued that the birth rate is not likely to respond 
to changes in the availability of physicians who perform obstetric deliveries. Yet 
they found that the birth rate is higher in areas with more physicians who deliver 
babies. This study should remind us to take a cautious view of studies inferring 
PID from a positive correlation between quantity and physician supply. It is much 
more likely that obstetricians locate in areas where there is a high demand for 
obstetric care per obstetrician than it is that a greater supply of obstetricians leads 
to more pregnancies. It is critical to identify the mechanism according to which 
quantity increases with increased supply. Some recent studies have found some 
direct evidence of a quantity-setting effect consistent with PID,  Chalkley and Tilley 
(2005)  for dentists in the UK and  Lien, Ma, and McGuire (2004)  among substance 
abuse counselors in the United States. Yet  Carlsen and Grytten (1998) , using data 
on physician visits and the provision of laboratory services in Norway, found no 
empirical evidence of inducement. 
 The bottom line is that the empirical evidence on PID is mixed. TI is so con-
ceptually flawed that it has not been assessed empirically. A first empirical step 
in such an analysis would be to evaluate how income targets are set by physicians. 
PID may exist some of the time and in certain countries, depending on how the 
health care system is structured and financed and the extent to which consumers 
of personal health care services possess adequate knowledge of quality, appropri-
ateness of services, and prices. 
 Public Policy Implications if PID Is Supported by Empirical Evidence 
 The public policy implications appropriate for a world in which PID is a dominant 
force are rather bleak. One popular approach — adopted, for example, by the Medi-
care program in the United States and by statutory health insurance in Germany — 
is for the government to set an expenditure target for spending on physicians ’ 

204 
 Part II / Chapter 5
services. After the target is reached, a percentage increase in quantity is offset by 
an equivalent percentage reduction in price. Thus, while individual physicians 
may induce demand, in the aggregate, the programs are protected against induce-
ment. While this type of policy may  “ work ”  from the standpoint of cost contain-
ment, individual patients may be adversely affected by unneeded treatments or 
shortages of care in instances in which PID does not operate (but rather the avail-
ability of certain beneficial types of care is adversely affected). Also, if the policy 
is practiced over a period of years, prices will become very low. To the extent to 
which price falls well below the marginal cost of supplying the service, will physi-
cians continue to supply it? 
 One solution for PID is thought to be capitation. In response to a concern 
about capitation, Ireland switched to this type of system for payment for general 
practitioner services provided to lower-income persons ( Madden, Nolan, and Nolan 
2005 ). However, under PID, capitation leads to  underprovision  of care. Capitation 
provides incentives that encourage physicians to limit medical expenditures. There 
is empirical evidence that these incentives work to limit expenditures ( Gaynor, 
Rebitzer, and Taylor 2004 ), but quality of care is about the same in capitated as in 
fee-for-service plans ( Miller and Luft 2002 ). 
 McGuire (2008)  described a fee structure that may be optimal even in situa-
tions in which the PID model is valid. We do not discuss his proposal here, but 
suggest to readers that the proposal and the background he provided are well worth 
reading not only for the proposal but also as a review and extension of the models 
presented in this chapter. 
 5.4 
 Price Discrimination 
 Background 
 With the spread of health insurance, price discrimination of the kind described by 
 Kessel (1958)  based on pricing practices prevailing in the 1950s, charging higher 
prices for high-than for low-income patients, has become much less common than 
it once was. However, another type of price discrimination has arisen in countries 
with multiple insurers, such as the United States. 
 In the United States, private health insurers tend to make higher payments 
for physicians ’ services than does Medicare, and Medicare pays more than Medic-
aid. Since the mid-1990s, insurers in the United States have increasingly required 
that physicians adhere to the fee schedules established by the insurers. That is, 
although there may be deductibles and co-pays, physicians can accept the fee 
determined by the insurer as payment in full.  Balance billing,  or charging the 
patient more than the scheduled amount, either is limited to a percentage 
above the scheduled amount or is completely prohibited. Before the mid-1990s, 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 205
physicians had greater latitude in setting their own fees. Often, patients received 
a bill from the physician and collected reimbursement directly from the insurer. 
The insurer paid patients for care received using the cost-sharing approaches 
described in chapter 3. 
 Medicaid was implemented in the mid-1960s with the objective of improving 
the access of low-income persons to  “ mainstream ” medicine. However, fees paid 
to physicians for providing services to persons covered by Medicaid have tended 
to be far below those paid by other insurers. Further, Medicaid requires that its 
payment be payment in full. There can be no balance billing. As a consequence, 
many US physicians refuse to accept Medicaid-insured persons. 
 Physicians ’  decisions to accept Medicaid can be analyzed assuming that 
physicians are profit-maximizing, price-discriminating monopolists. To price dis-
criminate, there must be two distinct product markets, each with its own demand 
curve. To obtain higher profit from price discrimination, there must be differences 
in the price elasticities of demand between the two markets. There can be no resale 
of product from the low-priced to the higher-priced market, which clearly applies 
in the case of personal services. 
 Theory 
 To see how price discrimination works in the context of physicians ’ services, we 
assume that the physician faces two demand curves. In one market, the physician 
can set his or her fee. Insurance affects the position and shape of this demand 
curve, but the only constraint on physician fee setting in this market is market 
forces. In the other market, the physician is a price taker. If the physician accepts 
a patient for care who has this type of insurance coverage, the physician must 
accept the insurer ’ s payment as payment in full. Physicians are free to accept or 
reject patients on a patient-specific basis. That is, the physician may decide to 
accept up to a certain number of patients of this type and reject the others. Medicaid 
has paid physicians on this basis since its inception ( Sloan, Mitchell, and Cromwell 
1978 ). 
 The demand curve in the first market is  D P (  fig. 5.7 ). The demand curve in 
the first market is downward sloping. Marginal revenue (the addition to total 
revenue when another unit of service is sold) associated with  D P is  MR P . While the 
physician is a price setter in the first (non-Medicaid) market, the physician is a 
price taker from Medicaid. We assume that, in the Medicaid market, the physician 
can sell as many services as he or she wishes at the price set by the Medicaid 
program. In other words, the price elasticity of demand in this market is infinite. 
The requirement that the elasticities of demand differ between the two markets is 
thus satisfied. In addition, there is an administrative cost per unit of output. The 
administrative cost represents the cost of collecting payment from Medicaid (  ĝ ) and 
from non-Medicaid sources (  ğ ). For example, if there are delays in payment and 
the physician has to remind the insurer or Medicaid that he has not been paid, his 

206 
 Part II / Chapter 5
administrative cost rises. Since the administrative cost differs by payer, we subtract 
the per unit administrative cost from the prices in the two markets. 
 Other than for administration, a common cost function for the physician firm 
applies to both markets. Costs include the imputed value of physician time and 
cost of nonphysician labor and capital inputs. 
 The marginal cost curve (the change in total cost per unit change in volume 
of service) for the practice is MC. Since the total cost of treatment in both markets 
is assumed to be identical in the two markets, MC is also identical in both markets. 
Marginal cost equals marginal revenue net of   ğ in this market at ( x 1 ,  p 1 ), which 
gives the output in the first market and the associated price to patients in this 
market.  
 In the second market, in which the physician is a price taker, the demand 
curve is infinitely elastic.  p M  –   ĝ =  MR M .  M stands for Medicaid. The demand curve 
is flat and net of the per unit administrative cost equal to marginal revenue for two 
reasons. The physician has no control over price in this market, and it is further 
assumed that, for all practical purposes, there is an infinite number of patients in 
this market that the physician can accept.

 In this model, the physician is assumed to first accept for care those patients 
who are most profitable; the physician accepts patients in decreasing order of 
profitability. According to this rule, the physician starts with patients in the first 
market, accepting these patients up to ( x 2 ,  p 2 ), which is determined by  MR M =  MR P . 
From this point, the physician accepts patients in the second market until the 
physician reaches quantity  x T . The number of units accepted from the price-taking 
market is  x T  –  x 2. The rest of the units come from the first market. 
 Now suppose the price in the second market falls to  p ′ M . Then total output 
falls to  x ′ T . Output to the first market rises to  x 3 , which is determined by  D M ′ =  MR p . 
Since output in the first market rises, price falls in this market from  p 2 to  p 3 . Output 
to the second market falls from  x T  –  x 2 to x ′ T  –  x 3. The model ’ s main implication is 
that patients covered by the public program represented by the second market lose 
some access to physicians after the price cut. Total physician output falls, but the 
change in output is due to the decrease in output allocated to persons in the second 
market. Persons in the first market benefit from a reduction in price, and output 
to this market increases. 
 The next step is to assess the effects of changes in variables that are exogenous 
to the physician on the physician ’ s decision variables: output to both markets and 
price in the price-setting market. We distinguish between two cases. In case 1, the 
physician serves only the non-Medicaid market. In case 2, the physician serves 
both markets ( fig. 5.8 ). (For the mathematical expressions underlying the predicted 
effects of changes in exogenous variables, see  Sloan, Mitchell, and Cromwell 
[1978].) 
 The model predicts unambiguously that an outward shift in the non-Medicaid 
(price-setting) demand curve will raise output in the non-Medicaid market. If the 
physician did not accept Medicaid patients before the shift (case 1), the physician 
will not accept such patients following the shift. If the physician serves only the 
non-Medicaid market, the outward shift in non-Medicaid demand will have no 
effect on output to Medicaid patients. Rather, the physician will increase output 
to non-Medicaid patients. 
 An increase in demand in the non-Medicaid market may be caused by an 
increase in the population age or an increase in the per capita income of persons 
not on Medicaid. An increase in a non-Medicaid fee schedule would have the same 
effect qualitatively as an increase in demand in the non-Medicaid market due to a 
change in population size or a change in the demographic composition of the 
population, such as population aging.  
 If the shift is sufficiently large, and the physician was treating Medicaid 
patients before the shift, the physician may decide to close the practice to Medicaid 
patients. The physician will consider a dollar decrease in per unit administrative 
cost fully equivalent to a dollar increase in price. 
 An increase in a factor affecting practice cost, such as an increase in the wage 
rates of nonphysician personnel employed by the physician, would raise marginal 

208 
 Part II / Chapter 5
cost. If the physician was participating in both markets before the change, the 
physician would be expected to reduce output to Medicaid patients first. Output 
to the Medicaid market would be reduced until marginal revenue from Medicaid 
patients equaled marginal cost, which is assumed to fall with decreases in output, 
such as decreasing from  x T  –  x 2 to  x T ′  –  x 2 , as shown in   figure 5.9 . Output to the 
non-Medicaid market would not be affected as long as the physician was accepting 
Medicaid patients, such as  x 2 in f  igure 5.9 . But once the physician became a non-
participant in Medicaid, output in the non-Medicaid market would fall until mar-
ginal revenue in the non-Medicaid market equaled marginal cost.  
 Empirical Evidence 
 Economists have conducted much empirical analysis of physician decision-making 
based on this two-market model or variants of it. Overall, these studies documented 
a strong relationship between Medicaid fees relative to other payers and physician 
participation in Medicaid (see  Sloan, Mitchell, and Cromwell 1978 ;  Hadley 1979 ; 
 Held and Holahan 1985 ;  Mitchell 1991 ;  Adams 1994 ). Decreases in fees paid for 
providing services to Medicaid patients reduce physician willingness to accept

Medicaid patients, and conversely for increases in such fees ( Sloan, Mitchell, and 
Cromwell 1978 ;  Baker and Royalty 2000 ;  Cunningham and Hadley 2008 ). Publicly 
employed physicians see fewer Medicaid patients when Medicaid fees increase 
( Baker and Royalty 2000 ), but this is presumably because Medicaid patients ’ access 
to private physicians has increased. Studies using data on Medicaid-covered indi-
viduals in general provide support for the framework. For example, in one study, 
when Medicaid fees increased, Medicaid recipients were more likely to have a 
usual source of medical care and were more likely to visit a physician ( Shen and 
Zuckerman 2005 ). 
 The lesson for Medicaid programs is that they compete for physician time. 
Medicaid fees and ease of collection are important determinants of physician will-
ingness to accept Medicaid patients for care. 
 We have described what economists call third-degree price discrimination 
here. There is also first-degree price discrimination, which involves charging each 
consumer the price that represents the consumer ’ s maximum willingness to pay 
for the good or service. Physicians can price discriminate over quantities for the 
same consumer as well as across consumers.

 Summary and Conclusions 
 Economists distinguish between the short and the long run. This chapter has been 
organized around this conceptual distinction. Our analysis of long-run decisions 
included choice of occupation, such as a career in medicine; choice of physician 
specialty; choice of geographic location; and choice of practice mode. Since this 
book is about health economics, we focused on financial incentives and their role 
in career choices. While money affects students ’ choices, clearly other incentives 
matter as well. The economic analysis of long-run decisions physician make has 
been predominantly of US data. In the United States, there are definite financial 
returns to specialization. One remarkable finding is that although there has been 
a lot of public rhetoric emphasizing the importance of primary care, there is sub-
stantial financial incentive not to enter primary care fields, and this differential 
has persisted over time. The framework for analyzing geographic location of physi-
cians assumes that market pressures cause physicians to locate in smaller com-
munities when physicians become more numerous in the aggregate. This assumes 
that physicians cannot generate demand for their own services. If they can, physi-
cians could continue to locate in large cities without experiencing a decline in 
their earnings. Group practice offers several advantages, including diversification 
against the risk of reduced earnings, since incomes within the group are pooled. 
Yet such pooling may dilute financial incentives that individual physician members 
of the group face to devote effort to seeing patients and to practicing efficiently. 
 The short-run decisions involve choices about price and output, the quality 
of such output, and physician hours of work. The major question is whether or not 
standard economic models adequately describe markets for physicians ’ services. 
Our clear bias as authors is first to examine standard economic models to be sure 
they do not provide adequate explanations of the stylized facts. In fact, they do 
describe some features of these markets. Others who start with a bias that standard 
economic models may not be relevant in this context are attracted to the nonstan-
dard models, especially the physician-induced demand model. The fact that more 
doctors leads to higher rates of utilization of physicians ’ services can be explained 
by standard models. The anomalies of pricing are less adequately explained by 
such models. We conclude that the empirical evidence supporting PID is not strong, 
but the evidence on the other side is insufficiently strong to rule it out either. 
Empirical evidence for the two-market model described at the end of this chapter 
is stronger than the evidence for PID on balance. This two-market model is based 
on a standard economic framework of price discrimination. Empirical evidence in 
support of this model, if anything, supports the relevance of a standard economic 
framework. 
 The debate in the health economics community about the adequacy of stan-
dard economic approaches for analyzing the physicians ’ services market continues,

albeit at a reduced level, and we cannot resolve this debate here. Economists have 
debated the issue since the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the controversy is not 
fully settled yet.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 5.1  
 List three factors that are plausible influences on physicians ’ marginal revenue 
product and explain your answers. 
 5.2  
 In this chapter, we noted there is some empirical evidence that beginning 
medical students systematically underestimate physicians ’ earnings. What 
might explain why prospective medical students and beginning medical stu-
dents tend to underestimate earnings in this occupation? 
 5.3  
 The physician (supplier)-induced demand model has been proposed as a 
framework for explaining important features of physicians ’ services markets. 
Answer the following questions about physician-induced demand: 
 a.  What is meant by physician-induced demand? 
 b.  Specifically which stylized facts about physicians ’ services markets does PID 
attempt to explain? 
 c.  What empirical evidence has been used to support the PID hypothesis? 

212 
 Part II / Chapter 5
 d.   What would be the consequences of an increase in physician supply on the 
price of physician services, the quantity of physician visits, and total physician 
expenditures according to the PID hypothesis? How would these predictions differ 
from those of a conventional economic model of physician behavior? 
 5.4 
 Explain the distinction between perfectly competitive and monopolistically 
competitive markets. Which type of market structure provides a better descrip-
tion of the market for physicians ’ services? Justify your answer. 
 5.5 
 Define  “ search, ”   “ experience, ”  and  “ credence ” goods. Which label best 
applies to each of the following? Discuss each case and justify your answers. 
 a.  notebook computer; 
 b.  physician office visit; 
 c.  applying for admission to medical school; 
 d.   surgical treatment; 
 e.  prescription drugs. 
 5.6 
 If the internal rate of return on legal education were twice that of the internal 
rate of return on medical education, how would you determine whether or 
not this is an equilibrium differential? Be sure to explain the distinction 
between the difference in compensation that represents an equilibrium dif-
ferential from one that does not. 
 5.7 
 As reported in Gaynor and Gertler ’ s paper, more than 60 percent of US physi-
cians practice in some type of group setting. 
 a.  List the pros and cons of group practices as compared to solo practice. That is, 
what benefits can physicians receive if they join the group practice, and what costs 
do physicians or society as a whole need to pay for group practices? 
 b.  Which of the following doctors are more likely to join group practices, other 
things being equal? Explain your answers. 
 i.  risk-averse versus risk-neutral physicians; 
 ii.  young versus mature physicians; 
 iii.  male versus female physicians. 
 5.8 
 The Pauly-Satterthwaite model was developed to explain why physicians ’ 
fees tend to be higher in markets with more physicians relative to the 
population. 
 a.  Using graphs, show why physicians ’ fees may be higher in geographic areas in 
which physicians are relatively numerous. 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 213
 b.  What is the argument that search costs are higher in market areas with more 
doctors (according to the model)? How would the existence of other organizations, 
such as governments and private health insurers, as participants in the market for 
physicians ’  services affect the analysis? 
 5.9  
 Suppose you are contemplating a career as a physician, and you hear the 
following news from your country. Explain whether the following news is 
 “ good news ” or  “ bad news ” for your decision to choose medicine as a career. 
Good news means that the event increases your financial incentive to become 
a physician, and vice versa for bad news. Discuss each case separately, and 
justify your answers. Identify uncertainties that add ambiguity to the 
analysis. 
 a.  The share of gross domestic product spent on health care has increased substan-
tially over time and is expected to increase in the future. 
 b.  Payment reform will lead to a switch from fee-for-service payments to a capita-
tion plan. 
 c.   The government announces it will build a new medical school in your state. 
 d.   The government announces it will implement national health insurance that 
will provide comprehensive benefits to every citizen.

 5.2  Suppose a country has a total of three cities: city A has a population of 
550,000, and cities B and C have populations of 200,000 and 10,000, respectively. 
Say there are 60 physicians in the country. Assume that per capita demand for 
medical care is the same in the three cities, and the cities are equally desirable 
places in which to practice medicine and live. 
 a.   How will the physicians be allocated among the three cities if physicians ’ earn-
ings are to be equalized among the cities? 
 b.   Suppose physician supply increased by a third in the country. How would this 
affect the allocation of physicians among the cities? 
 5.3  Suppose the country ’ s national health insurance authority cuts the price it 
pays physicians for performing a procedure. Use a goods-leisure analysis (goods 
or income on one axis and leisure on the other) to answer the following 
questions: 
 a.   A backward-bending supply curve of labor can be derived from the indifference 
curve analysis of goods and leisure. Explain using graphs (one for the indiffer-
ence curve analysis and the other for the supply of labor function corresponding 
to the indifference curve analysis). 

The Market for Physicians’ Services 
 215
 b.   Isolate income and substitution effects from a decrease in the wage rate. ( Note : 
In isolating the income and substitution effect, the practice is to draw a line 
parallel to the new price line and tangent to the indifference curve where the 
person was  before the price change.) 
 c.   Now assume that Medicare is the only payer. Medicare decreases the unit price 
of a service from $34 to $24. Show how the goods-leisure analysis is useful for 
addressing this question. (You will need to translate price per unit of service 
into work hours. Just make an assumption and state what it is.) 
 5.4   Analyze the effects of the following changes on the physician ’ s decision to 
participate in the Medicaid program and on the number of visits provided to Med-
icaid and privately insured patients. 
 a.   A cut in the fee Medicaid pays physicians for a visit (and Medicaid requires 
physicians who accept this payment to accept it as payment in full). How would 
the cut affect the number of visits provided to Medicaid patients? Use a graph. 
Show the point at which the doctor will not provide care to Medicaid patients 
at all. 
 b.   A $10 increase in the amount a private insurer pays per visit. Show the effect 
of the price change on the provision of care to Medicaid and private patients. 
 c.   A 15 percent increase in the wage rates of nonphysician personnel employed 
in the practice. (You need to assume a fraction of practice expense that goes to 
the wages of nonphysician personnel.) How will this wage change affect physi-
cian participation in Medicaid? Show graphically. 
 5.5   In 1988, there was a Medicare fee reduction in the United States. Medicare 
cut the payment for open heart surgery by 2 – 15 percent. Answer the following 
questions: 
 a.   For thoracic surgeons, who perform open heart surgery, what is the income 
effect of this fee cut? 
 b.   What is the substitution effect induced by this fee cut, again for thoracic 
surgeons? 
 c.   What happens when the income effect dominates the substitution effect? Does 
an insurer realize savings from a fee cut when the income effect dominates the 
substitution effect? Explain your answer. Suppose you were director of your 
country ’ s national health insurance program. What public policies would you 
implement if you knew that the income effect dominates the substitution effect?

 Hospitals 
 Worldwide, hospitals incorporate the latest in medical technology in a country and 
tend to care for the most acutely ill persons. Patients seek hospital care either 
because they have an acute illness, such as pneumonia, or because they are expe-
riencing particularly serious adverse consequences of a chronic illness, such as a 
heart attack among persons with heart disease. 
 This was not always so. In the nineteenth century, in such countries as the 
United States and the United Kingdom, hospitals tended to be almshouses, caring 
for the poor, while more affluent persons received care at home. Given very inad-
equate infectious disease control in hospitals, patients ran the risk of acquiring 
diseases during their hospital stays that they did not have on admission. During 
the first half of the twentieth century, infection control in hospitals improved 
appreciably. Especially in high-income countries, hospitals made most of their 
strides in technology adoption during the latter half of the twentieth century, but 
at the same time, more sophisticated technology and more intensive care in hos-
pitals led to increases in hospital costs. 
 During much of the latter part of the twentieth century and on into the 
twenty-first century, governments and private insurers in high-income countries 
have devoted much effort to hospital cost containment. One reason why care in 
many hospitals is so expensive is that hospital care tends to be very labor-intensive. 
More often than not, labor in hospitals is not a substitute for capital. Rather, 
technological change is embodied in plant and equipment, for example in surgi-
cal suites and medical imaging equipment. A considerable amount of labor is 
needed to operate the technology. Thus, capital and labor in hospitals are often 
complements. 

220 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 The hospital occupies a central place in health systems in all countries. This 
chapter describes important theories of hospital behavior and why the private not-
for-profit ownership form is dominant in many countries. We present empirical 
evidence on differences in hospital performance by ownership. One special feature 
of hospitals involves the relationship between the medical staff and the hospital, 
and this relationship is evolving, as described in the chapter. A major policy deci-
sion in every country is how to pay hospitals for services rendered. We discuss 
alternative payment arrangements, the role of public regulation in this sector, and 
reliance on competition as opposed to hospital regulation as a method for achieving 
socially desirable outcomes. 
 6.1 
 Context 
 Aside from the technological sophistication of many hospitals, important among 
the distinguishing characteristics of hospitals is that relatively few hospitals 
are organized on a for-profit basis. This is in contrast to physicians ’ practices, 
pharmaceutical companies, and nursing homes, which are most often organized 
on a for-profit basis. Rather, private not-for-profit and public ownership forms 
are most numerous, with the relative shares of not-for-profit and public forms 
varying substantially among countries. A not-for-profit or public hospital may 
be expected to make decisions about the mix and amount of services it provides 
and pricing based on considerations other than pure profit seeking. Profits 
cannot be distributed to shareholders, or more generally  “ residual claimants, ” as 
occurs with for-profit organizations. Residual claimants are parties that receive the 
balance remaining after labor and capital inputs have been paid. This limitation 
on the distribution of profits has been termed a  “ nondistribution constraint ” 
( Hansmann 1996 ). Rather than distribute profits, such funds may be allocated to 
other uses, for example, to providing a higher level of quality than the market 
demands. 
 The dominance of organizational forms other than the for-profit form leads 
to several questions, addressed in this chapter. First, how do hospital not-for-profits 
differ from their for-profit counterparts, and what is the economic rationale for this 
form of organization? Second, how does ownership form affect hospital perfor-
mance? This latter question is important in sectors other than health care. Countries 
make various decisions about ownership in a variety of sectors of the economy, 
such as whether or not to nationalize telephone or airline companies or keep 
them private. Third, who is the residual claimant — the party to whom profits and 
losses accrue after all revenue has been received and all inputs in the production 
process have been paid — when the hospital is not-for-profit: physicians at the 
hospital? Hospital administrators? Trustees? And why does the identity of the 

Hospitals 
 221
residual claimant matter? Private hospitals may have three types of managers: 
administrators employed by the hospital, the medical staff, and hospital trustees. 
Rather than report to hospital trustees, public hospital administrators may report 
to public officials within a municipality ’ s department of health. 
 Hospitals are not the only type of organization in which for-profit entities are 
a minority. Libraries, museums, and houses of worship are other examples. Our 
discussion of not-for-profitness and its effects is applicable to such types of orga-
nizations as well — with some differences in detail reflecting differences in product 
markets and attributes. 
 In some countries, such as the United States, physicians who practice at 
hospitals (the  “ medical staff ” ) are generally not employed by hospitals but rather 
are affiliated with independent physicians ’ practices. There are medical staff orga-
nizations in hospitals, which set operating rules for the provision of medical care 
within hospitals, but medical staff organizations typically do not become involved 
in financial transactions. In many other countries, for example Germany, the 
medical staff is employed by the hospital. Other physicians are in independent 
practice but do not treat patients within the walls of the hospital. 
 The separate organizational forms of physicians and hospitals are not 
unique to the hospital sector. For example, independent farmers form purchasing 
cooperatives. These cooperatives serve the collective interests of individual 
independent farmers by allowing them to purchase supplies such as seed and 
fertilizer at lower prices than they could if they purchased individually rather than 
collectively. 
 Increasing hospital costs, which have far outpaced inflation and the growth 
of gross domestic product, have led governments to adopt several alternative 
approaches to regulating hospitals, including imposing controls over hospital entry 
into a market and controls over hospital prices and budgets. Again, although regu-
lation is common in the hospital sector worldwide, such regulation is not unique 
to hospitals. For example, private transportation companies (e.g., taxis, buses) are 
often subject to regulation. Antitrust enforcement has become increasingly common 
in such countries as the United States. However, such enforcement is clearly not 
unique to the hospital sector in that country. 
 6.2 
 Alternative Models of Hospital Behavior 
 The Profit-Maximizing Hospital: The Base Case 
 Even though most hospitals are not-for-profit, the for-profit ownership form is the 
most common in most other sectors, and for-profit decision making provides a 
useful framework for comparing the other frameworks presented below. We assume 
that health care delivery in the country is essentially private. The models described 

222 
 Part II / Chapter 6
in this chapter are most applicable to high-income countries. Furthermore, since 
the authors have been based in the United States, the models are mostly directly 
applicable to US hospitals, but they offer useful frameworks for other countries as 
well, although with some modifications to reflect institutional practices in these 
countries. Chapter 13 describes health care systems in which the provision of 
services is public. 
 Initially we make these assumptions: First, the hospital decides on the quan-
tity of services it will provide during a given period, say a day.  1 A measure of 
quantity is the number of patients hospitalized at the facility in a day. 
 The hospital faces a downward-sloping demand curve for its services. As 
explained earlier, having a downward-sloping demand curve means that the orga-
nization has the power to set price. The hospital ’ s product market is not perfectly 
competitive. In most hospital markets, there are few sellers, if for no other reason 
than residents are likely to prefer nearby hospitals to those at greater differences, 
which in and of itself confers some market power on individual hospitals. Another 
factor affecting the competitiveness of individual hospitals is the market power of 
purchasers of hospital services. Where insurers or governments have market power, 
individual hospitals have less market power, and conversely. If the market for 
hospital services were competitive or if a government agency had the power to 
dictate the prices hospitals charge, the demand curve facing the organization would 
be horizontal. 
 With a downward-sloping demand curve, there is a one-to-one relationship 
between quantity of output  x and  p , the price the organization charges for the single 
product it sells.  p =  p ( x ). 
 Let profit be  π . Then 
 π =  p ( x ) x  –  C ( x ),  
 where  C ( x ) is the total cost of producing output at quantity  x . 
  dC

 is the first derivative of total cost with respect to  x .

 is the firm ’ s marginal cost. Total revenue  R ( x ) is  p ( x ) x . Marginal revenue is

 Quantity is set at the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. 
Once optimal quantity  x * has been determined, optimal price  p * is read from the 
demand curve. The optimal values are shown graphically in chapter 5, figure 5.5a. 
 In the previous chapter in the monopolistic competition model, marginal 
revenue was shown to equal marginal cost at the point at which profit was zero. 
Monopolistic competition is more realistic in the physician than in the hospital 
market since physicians are often numerous in a market. By contrast, there are 
typically few hospitals — often only one. Figure 5.5b depicts optimal price-quantity 
combinations under monopolistic competition. In this model, profit is zero in 
equilibrium. This is shown with the average cost curve tangent to the average 
revenue curve. By contrast, in the simple monopoly case, the firm is likely to earn 
a profit shown by the rectangle (see fig. 5.5a). 
 Now consider a case in which the firm has control over both the quantity and 
the quality of the product it provides. Let the quality level be  y . Then the problem 
for the firm is to set quantity, quality, and hence price, which rises with increases 
in quality but falls with increases in quantity. Total cost  C is positively related to 
both  x and  y . 
 Profit  π =  p ( x,y ) x  –  C ( x,y ). 
(6.1) 
 Finding the optimal levels of  x and  y that maximize  π involves setting  x * 
at the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost and  y * at the 
quality at which marginal revenue from changes in  y equals the marginal cost of 
changing  y .

 Intuitively, the firm finds the quantity-quality combination that yields the largest

 An important implication of this model is that firms will provide different 
levels of quality. Quality will be higher when the price increase associated with 
an increase in quality is higher, that is,

 A Model of a Private Not-for-Profit Hospital 
 The Model ’ s Basics 
 The above model is for firms that have profit maximization as an organizational 
objective. Other models have been developed to depict hospital behavior when the 
hospital is not organized on a for-profit basis.  
 In an oft-cited model of a not-for-profit hospital developed by Joseph  New-
house (1970) , hospitals are not interested in profit for its own sake. Rather, the 
hospital is interested in maximizing utility ( U ), which depends on the amount of 
quantity and quality of care the hospital provides. Let  U =  U ( x,y ). The hospital 
maximizes utility subject to a constraint. 
 To derive the constraint, consider the hospital ’ s demand and average cost 
curve in   figure 6.1 . The demand curve relates price to quantity of hospital care 
demanded; the average cost is a function of quantity as well. Both demand and 
average cost curves are defined for a given quality level. When quality changes, the

 Hospital Demand and Cost Curves for Hospitals with High ( H ) and Low ( L ) Quality 
Figure 6.1 shows intersections when quality is allowed to vary from  L  to  H , not optimal quantity ( x ), when

Hospitals 
 225
demand and cost curves must shift, the former, however, only if patients are willing 
to pay a higher price for a higher-quality level. If not, the demand curve does not 
shift. The demand curve shifts outward (rightward) as quality is increased. But the 
average cost curve ( C / x =  AC ) also increases with increases in hospital quality.  
 The demand curve relates average price to quantity. Let  R be the hospital ’ s 
total revenue. Then average revenue or price is  R / x . Thus, where the demand and 
average cost curves intersect,  R =  C , such as at the intersection of  D L and  AC L and 
 D H and  AC H , profit is zero. Since demand and average cost curves are defined for 
a single quality level, when quality changes, so do the intersections of the two 
curves. An increase in quality leads to an intersection at a higher level of  x if for 
a given increase in quality, the demand curve shifts by more than the average cost 
curve, as seen when quality increases from a low level ( L ) to a high level ( H ), and 
conversely if the average cost curve shifts more than the demand curve, as when 
quality increases from  H to  HH  (  fig. 6.2 ).  
 A curve connecting the points of intersection of demand and average cost 
curves defines the hospital ’ s production possibility curve (  fig. 6.3 ). In the model, a 
not-for-profit hospital earns zero profit. The points along the production possibility 
curve represent points on which the hospital can operate. Points inside the produc-
tion possibility curve are also feasible, but they do not yield zero hospital profit.

to right to left. 

226 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 The production possibility curve is positively sloped at low levels of quality 
but negatively sloped at higher levels of quality (  fig. 6.4 ). There is an intuitive 
explanation for this pattern. At low levels of quality, a given increase in quality is 
highly valued by patients, resulting in relatively large outward shifts in demand 
relative to smaller upward shifts in average cost. At some level of quality, the two 
shifts are equal, and for higher levels of quality increase than this, the demand 
curve shifts out less than the average cost curve shifts up. Then the intersections 
move to the left, that is, to lower levels of quantity than if average cost had shifted 
less than the demand curve shifted.  
 Thus far, the hospital ’ s levels of quality, quantity, price, and average cost are 
indeterminate. There are infinite combinations of these variables. To see how the 
hospital selects optimal levels of these variables, we recall that the hospital has a 
utility function,  U , which depends on the same variables as does the production 
possibility curve,  x and  y . Utility is maximized at the point of tangency of the slope 
of the  U and the production possibility curve (  fig. 6.4 ). Since the slope of the hos-
pital utility function is negative, depicting various combinations of  x and  y yielding 
the same utility, the tangency occurs mostly on the negatively sloped portion 
of the production possibility curve.

Hospitals 
 227
 Hospital utility functions are likely to differ among hospitals. Some hospitals 
may place a higher value on providing a high quantity of hospital care. Others 
may be more oriented toward providing high quality at the sacrifice of some 
quantity. 
 How is the hospital ’ s utility defined? A first step is to identify who maximizes 
utility, that is, who makes choices on the hospital ’ s behalf. Newhouse allows 
for several hospital  “ bosses ” (our term), including hospital administrators, 
medical staff, and trustees. There is only one  U , and the relative importance of 
each group in forming the hospital ’ s  U may be expected to differ among hospitals, 
as do relative preferences for  x and  y . For this reason, exactly which combination 
of  x and  y  will be chosen by the hospital cannot be determined from the model. 
However, it is possible to assess the effects of certain changes that are beyond the 
hospital ’ s control (exogenous changes) on the hospital ’ s production possibility 
curves. 
 Thus far, we have been silent about what Newhouse meant by quality of 
hospital care. In the Newhouse model, quality is equated with money. A hospital 
with an average cost of $100 per patient day is half as good as one with a $200 
average cost. Presumably the $200 hospital employs twice the level of inputs than 
the $100 per hospital day hospital does and in this sense is twice as good. This is 
admittedly a crude measure of quality. We defer our discussion of how quality of 
care is measured in the real world to chapter 7.

 Effects of Exogenous Changes in Wage Rates, Population Size, 
Fraction of Persons with Health Insurance Coverage, and Subsidies 
of Hospitals 
 Exogenous changes, a general concept, here refer to changes beyond the hospital ’ s 
control. Endogenous changes are ones the hospital makes in response to changes 
in various exogenous factors. 
 Important among the exogenous changes are the following: an increase in the 
wage rate of the hospital ’ s employees, an increase in the population in the hospi-
tal ’ s market area with health insurance coverage, and implementation of a fixed 
dollar subsidy per  x by the city administration. We assume here that hospitals are 
price takers in markets for their labor. This means that hospitals must respond to 
wage increases offered by other potential employers of their labor. We also assume 
that the hospital has no influence over the public subsidies it receives. It is plau-
sible that a change in the population with health insurance is exogenous to an 
individual hospital. 
 We leave it as exercises for readers to figure out how the production possibil-
ity curve will shift in response to each change. A fixed dollar subsidy per  x will 
allow the hospital to charge patients a price that is less than average cost. 
 The Pauly-Redisch Model of the Not-for-Profit Hospital as a 
Physicians ’ Cooperative 
 Another well-known model of hospital behavior but one that emphasizes a com-
pletely different aspect of hospital behavior is by  Pauly and Redisch (1973) . This 
model, too, has stood the test of time. 
 In the United States, up to now, physicians who practice in hospitals most 
frequently do so as independent agents.  2 Although employment arrangements for 
physicians are becoming more common, most physicians who practice at a hospital 
are not employees of the hospital. Some but not the majority of physicians have 
contractual relationships with hospitals. Contracts have been most common among 
specialists whose presence is critical to hospital operations, including emergency 
room physicians, anesthesiologists, radiologists, and pathologists. 
 There is a medical staff organization at each hospital that is under the physi-
cians ’  control. The hospital administration and his or her staff are responsible for 
employing hospital personnel such as nurses and laboratory technicians, purchas-
ing medical supplies, and providing hospital plant and equipment and the main-
tenance thereof. 
 The medical staff organization grants individual physicians  “ staff privileges, ” 
which allow physicians to practice at the hospital. Physicians admit their 
patients to hospitals where they provide care for their patients. The medical staff 
organization sets many if not most of the clinical policies at the hospital, for 
example, which physicians are allowed to perform surgical procedures at the hos-
pital, and limits on the types of surgical procedures that individual physicians can 
2.  In some countries, 
such as France, 
physicians who work in 
private hospitals are 
paid on a fee-for-service 
basis for the services 
they provide. However, 
the medical staff of 
public hospitals is 
salaried ( Burstall and 
Wallerstein 1994 , 377).

Hospitals 
 229
perform. Staff members who are employees of the hospital or self-employed but 
with a contractual arrangement with the hospital work with physicians who are 
not employees. 
 Hospital trustees serve on the board of the hospital. They meet periodically 
to review hospital operations and finances. Trustee approval is generally required 
to approve major changes in hospital policy or for major investments in hospital 
plant and equipment. At least historically, hospital trustees have had an oversight 
role, but they have often been fairly passive decision makers, relying for many of 
their decisions on the recommendations of the hospital administration and medical 
staff. In the United States, trustees may be specialized in health care, but more 
often they bring other experiences to the hospital board, such as business experi-
ence. Some hospital boards expect trustees to be actively involved in raising funds 
for the hospital. Since not-for-profit and public hospitals do not have shareholders, 
shareholders do not elect board members. Many board members are appointed by 
existing trustees or hospital executives, which potentially raises concerns about 
the independence of such board members, whether hospital performance is ade-
quately scrutinized, and the power of boards constituted in this way. If boards are 
not powerful, this enhances the relative power of other hospital stakeholders, 
including the physicians who practice there. 
 The medical staff organization has the formal responsibility of evaluating 
physician competence before a physician is allowed to join the hospital medical 
staff. The organization is formally responsible for oversight of quality of care at the 
hospital. A stated rationale for medical staff organizations is quality assurance. 
However, by limiting entry, medical staffs may also have an anticompetitive effect 
on the market for hospital care. The Pauly-Redisch model focuses on such possible 
anticompetitive effects. 
 All medical staffs scrutinize physician credentials prior to admitting a 
physician to membership. However, membership on some medical staffs is closed. 
That is, the medical staff bars additional physicians from being included on 
the hospital ’ s medical staff. The medical staff would not state that the entry 
barrier reflects self-serving anticompetitive motives. Rather, the rationale is likely 
to be cast in terms of lack of operating room capacity or lack of hospital capacity 
to allow additional physicians to admit their patients to the hospital more 
generally. 
 While hospitals ’ organizational structure in principle is designed to safeguard 
quality of patient care, from another vantage point the structure may bear a similar-
ity to a cartel designed to maximize profits for the residual claimants, the group of 
individuals who receive the profit if a profit is made. Not-for-profit hospitals do 
not formally distribute profits to shareholders. This does not mean that profits 
are not earned; nor does it mean that profits are not distributed in some implicit 
form, for example, in the form of equipment that physicians use in their practices 

230

and for services for which they can bill separately, free and reserved parking for 
medical staff, hospital personnel who provide follow-up for surgical patients in 
the hospital, allowing the surgeon to see other patients in his or her hospital office, 
and travel to resort areas for meetings. 
 In their seminal paper,  Mark Pauly and Michael Redisch (1973 ) noted the 
similarity between hospitals ’ medical staff organizations and other cooperatives, 
including workers ’ cooperatives, that existed in some socialist countries, such as 
the former Yugoslavia, or farmers ’ cooperatives in capitalist countries. 
 A cooperative may form for various reasons. For example, a farmers ’ coopera-
tive may form to enable farmer members to realize economies in purchasing of seed 
and fertilizer or to own farm equipment jointly. The farmer members remain inde-
pendent entrepreneurs. Any profit the cooperative earns is shared by the members. 
In some respects, the farmers ’ cooperative resembles the physician group practice 
described in chapter 5. 
 The Pauly-Redisch model relies on several assumptions. First, although the 
patient who is hospitalized receives two bills, one from the hospital and the other 
from the patient ’ s physician, a widespread common practice in the United States, 
the patient cares only about the  total  price of the hospital stay, not the separate 
charges of the hospital and the physician. For this reason, demand as measured by 
the number of hospital stays demanded depends on the total price per hospital 
stay. A hospital stay typically spans several days. In this model, length of stay is 
assumed to be fixed. 
 Second, the Pauly-Redisch model takes the term  “ not-for-profit ”  literally. The 
hospital earns zero profit.  3 Any profit earned as a result of running the hospital 
accrues to the physician members of the medical staff. 
 Let  p be the total price of the hospital stay and  x be the total number of stays 
demanded. Then  p =  p ( x ). Price  p includes payment to the hospital and to the 
doctor. Let  p h be the price the hospital charges. The hospital must break even. That 
is, revenue or  p h x =  wL +  cK , where  w is the wage rate paid hospital employees,  L 
is the number of persons employed other than physicians,  c is the price of capital, 
and  K is the units of capital employed. 
 Total revenue is distributed between the hospital and the hospital ’ s physi-
cians (medical staff). Then  px  =  p h x +  Y M M , where  Y M is the mean income per 
physician on the medical staff and  M is the number of medical staff members at 
the hospital. The product  Y M M may be rewritten as  Y M M = ( p  –  p h ) x . Then  Y M = 
(( p  –  p h ) x )/ M . Substituting  wL   –  cK for  p h x yields  Y M = ( px   –  wL   –  cK )/ M . 
 Quantity  x is produced by three inputs, physicians working at the hospital, 
nonphysican labor, and capital. The quantity  x =  x ( M,L,K ). Since  p =  p ( x ), when  x 
increases,  p falls. Thus, adding more hospital inputs  M ,  L , and  K increases  x and 
causes the price to fall. 
 Input levels  M ,  L , and  K , which determine hospital output levels, are set 
to maximize income per doctor at the hospital. The collective decision of the

the United States,

hospital ’ s doctors is thus to maximize  Y M , where  Y M = ( px   –  wL   –  cK )/ M . The total 
collective income of the doctors on the hospital ’ s medical staff is the product of 
income per doctor and the number of doctors on the medical staff. Mathematically 
this is done by taking the first derivatives of  Y M and setting them to zero. These 
are termed the first-order conditions. 
 For non-physician labor,  Y M is maximized when this condition is satisfied:

 The first term on the left side is the marginal product of labor. The term in

of labor and marginal revenue is the marginal revenue product of labor. Equation 
6.3 indicates that the hospital hires labor until the marginal revenue product 
( MRP L ) equals the wage rate. This equilibrium condition for the optimal amount of 
labor for the hospital to employ ( L *) is shown in   figure 6.5 .  
 The same analysis applies for capital, but then  K is substituted for  L and  c is 
substituted for  w . For capital, maximizing income per physician requires setting  K 
to  K *, where the marginal revenue product of capital is equal to the rental cost of 
capital  c . 
 The condition for the optimal medical staff size  M * is more complicated.

 Multiply the equation by  M  and move the second term to the right side of the 
equation. This fraction, the first term, equals  Y M , the second term, which is income 
per doctor or, equivalently, the average revenue product of physicians at the hos-
pital. The left side of the equation is the marginal revenue product of physicians 
( MRP M ). Thus,  M *, the optimal number of physicians on the medical staff of the 
hospital, is set at the point at which the average revenue product equals the mar-
ginal revenue product of physicians. 

232 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 The equilibrium is shown graphically in   figure 6.6 . The  MRP M curve is nega-
tively sloped. The other curve is the average net income of physicians on the 
medical staff,  Y M . Average net income initially rises with increases in hospital 
medical staff size  M , reaches a maximum, and then decreases as additional physi-
cians are added. Income per doctor is maximized at the quantity of medical staff 
members where the marginal revenue product of physicians equals average net 
income, which is the optimal medical staff size ( M *) from the collective financial 
vantage point of physicians on the hospital ’ s medical staff. This is a private 
optimum, not a social optimum.  
 Thus far, we have assumed that the hospital medical staff can attract the 
number of physicians that is consistent with maximizing income per doctor on 
the hospital ’ s medical staff. That is, once it decides how many doctors it wants, 
the doctors can be attracted and paid  Y M . 
 This assumption may be realistic for some communities, particularly in very 
large cities, but not for others, such as smaller communities. If the supply curve of 
physicians were infinitely elastic, like  S M (f  ig. 6.7 ), then there would be more phy-
sicians available to the hospital than  M *. If so, the hospital ’ s medical staff would 
have to turn down applications for membership on the medical staff. In such a 
case, membership is  “ closed, ” and no applicants even if qualified on medical 
grounds would be able to join.

 But in many communities, hospitals face positively sloped supply-of-
physicians curves (  fig. 6.8 ). The slope is positive because physicians are heteroge-
neous with respect to their preferences for specific locations. For example, 
physicians and their families may place different emphasis on living near 
their relatives, being in a community with good schools, living near the beach or 
near the mountains, and so on. At a low income per physician, a hospital will 
attract those physicians with ties to the location, perhaps because they were born 
and raised in the location. To attract additional physicians, income will have to 
rise. At some income, physicians with preferences for locating near a beach 
or practicing in a major teaching hospital may be willing to locate in a moun-
tainous community and practice at a nonteaching hospital. The notion of compen-
sating wage or income differentials developed in the previous chapter applies here 
as well.  
 Figure 6.8  shows two alternative supply-of-physicians curves for individual 
hospitals,  S L and  S H . The reason that  S L lies upward and to the left of  S H is that 
it is located in an area that is generally less attractive to physicians than the area 
for which  S H is the relevant supply curve. Suppose, for example, that the crime 
rate is much higher in one city than in another. Then, holding other factors 

234 
 Part II / Chapter 6
constant, physicians will require to be paid more to offset the undesirability of 
living and working in a high-crime area. 
 Recall that  M * is the number of physicians on the medical staff at the point 
at which the marginal revenue product of physicians equals the average net income 
of physicians. Suppose that the supply curve intersects the average revenue product 
curve to the left of  M *, a situation depicted by the intersection of  S L with the 
average revenue product curve in  figure 6.8 . Then the hospital will not be able to 
attract as many physicians as it desires. 
 There are two implications. First, such hospitals will maintain an open 
medical staff, welcoming all qualified physicians who wish to practice there. 
Second, the hospital may complain to public policy makers that the area faces 
a physician shortage. Governments might respond by implementing incentives 
for physicians to practice in the community. 
 The goal of attracting more physicians to the area can be accomplished in 
several ways. For example, the government may subsidize the educational expenses 
of persons who agree to practice in a  “ shortage area ” for a few years after entering 
 Figure 6.7

the practice of medicine. Or the community may be able to convince the govern-
mental authority to open a medical school nearby. This medical school would 
attract individuals who had roots in the area and would be willing to practice in 
the community upon graduation. 
 A different picture emerges if the relevant physician supply curve is  S H . Then 
the physician supply curve intersects the average revenue curve to the right of  M *. 
In this situation, more physicians will be available than the hospital ’ s medical staff 
desires. In this situation, the medical staff will restrict entry. The medical staff will 
be  “ closed. ”  That is, not all qualified physicians who apply will be admitted to the 
medical staff. 
 Up to now, we have assumed that there is full agreement among the residual 
claimants, the physicians on the hospital ’ s medical staff, about the optimal levels 
of each input,  L ,  K , and  M . Not only is there full agreement, at least after the input 
decisions have been reached, but every member of the medical staff works in the 
collective interest of the medical staff as a whole. 
 However, human nature may differ from the ideal, which is that decision 
makers always serve the collective interest. In practice, individual physicians may 
find it financially advantageous to use resources to their own individual advantage.

the collective, the nurse may effectively substitute for the physician ’ s time. Or a 
physician may use the hospital ’ s office staff for personal use. Because of individual 
pursuit of self-interest, the collective may break down. This may be a particularly 
serious problem for large hospitals where there are many physicians on the medical 
staff, making the actions of individual physicians harder to monitor. Also, if there 
are more physicians, the actions of one  “ bad apple ” have less of a deleterious effect 
on the performance of the organization as a whole. This serves as a disincentive 
for monitoring. 
 In practice, hospital medical staffs in the United States do implement various 
rules and employ monitoring systems to guard against individualistic behavior. 
However, rule making and monitoring require resources, and these resources add 
to the cost of hospital care. 
 Physician-Hospital Organizations 
 A recent development in the United States has been the growth in the number of 
physician-hospital organizations, or PHOs. These organizations are more formal 
combinations of medical staff and hospitals than the arrangements described above. 
One of the major activities of PHOs is joint marketing of their product to insurers. 
Rather than have insurers negotiate contracts separately with the hospital and each 
physician, the PHOs negotiate with each insurer as a single bargaining unit. The 
negotiations encompass not only physicians ’ services performed in the hospital 
but physicians ’ services performed in physicians ’ private offices as well. Conceptu-
ally, PHOs can be efficiency-enhancing and hence in the public interest, or alter-
natively they may detract from economic efficiency ( Cuellar and Gertler 2006 ). 
 The argument for PHOs goes as follows. In an environment in which health 
care providers compete for health care contracts from health insurers, PHOs may 
facilitate the use of financial incentives to members of the PHO to lower cost and 
improve quality of care, especially since care for an episode of illness or for a 
chronic disease typically spans both inpatient and ambulatory care settings, includ-
ing physicians ’ offices. The greater scale of PHOs than hospitals and physicians ’ 
offices working administratively separately makes it feasible to adopt large-scale 
management information systems that can be use to track patients ’ care and out-
comes — thereby, for example, avoiding the waste of duplicate testing. The PHO 
may be better positioned to monitor quality of care in ambulatory care settings than 
other organizations. PHOs may allow for better sharing of expensive equipment 
and facilities than is possible under the more separate arrangement described by 
the Pauly-Redisch model. 
 On the other hand, PHOs also may increase the bargaining power of hospitals-
physicians vis- à -vis individual health insurers. In the United States, unlike in some 
countries, such as Germany, where statutory insurers negotiate jointly, negotiations 
are conducted separately with each insurer. The default in the absence of a 
PHO is negotiation between individual physicians and individual insurers and 

Hospitals 
 237
individual hospitals and individual insurers. Physicians have more bargaining 
power if they conduct collective negotiations than if they bargain individually. 
 Many geographic markets are insufficiently large to support more than 
one PHO. While hospitals are often monopolists in their market areas, physicians 
typically are not. The PHO may allow the physicians in a market to leverage 
bargaining power through the hospital ’ s monopoly position. In one empirical 
investigation,  Cuellar and Gertler (2006 ) found that integration in the form of 
PHOs has little impact on efficiency, but markets with PHOs do have higher prices, 
especially markets in which the PHO operates in less competitive health care 
markets. 
 Summing Up 
 We have described three organizational forms of hospitals: for-profit; private not-
for-profit; and a private not-for-profit form in which physicians on the hospital 
medical staff are the residual claimants. A profit-maximizing hospital does not 
provide zero quality or even the minimum quality allowed for by public regulations 
but rather that quality level at which it maximizes profits. The hospital takes 
account of consumers ’ valuations of quality and picks that quality level at which 
consumers ’ marginal valuation of quality (the amount that consumers are willing 
to pay for an extra unit of quality, e.g., a reduction in the minimum nurse response 
time of a minute) equals the marginal cost of raising quality, such as the extra cost 
of achieving a minute in response time, by, for example, hiring additional nurses 
or improving information technology, which leads to better communication with 
patients. 
 In Newhouse ’ s private not-profit hospital model, consumers ’ valuations of 
quality are reflected in the position of the hospital ’ s demand curve for care. Inter-
sections of demand curves or, equivalently, average revenue curves and average 
cost curves determine the feasible set of attainable quantity-quality combinations 
that the hospital can achieve. The ultimate choice of the quantity-quality combina-
tion depends on the preferences of the hospital decision makers. If the decision 
makers place an emphasis on accepting large numbers of persons in the community 
for care, then quantity will be weighted more heavily in the final quantity-quality 
decision. Conversely, if the decision makers are oriented toward prestige, they 
might select a combination involving relatively higher quality and lower quantity. 
The key point is that quantity-quality in the Newhouse model depends on decision 
makers ’  preferences at least in part. By contrast, a profit maximizer ’ s quantity and 
quality decisions are totally driven by impersonal market forces. If the government 
is the insurer, then it is the government ’ s demand curve that matters. 
 In the Pauly-Redisch framework, the hospital breaks even, but input levels 
are set to maximize profit per physician on the hospital ’ s medical staff. The Pauly-
Redisch model is silent about the quality of hospital care. However, at the cost of 
adding complexity, quality could be included as a decision variable. Output would 

238 
 Part II / Chapter 6
then have quality and quantity dimensions, and the hospital production function 
would reflect this. 
 We have not explicitly presented a model for public hospitals, the third major 
ownership form. The for-profit and the physicians ’ cooperative models provide 
inappropriate frameworks for public hospitals. However, the Newhouse model 
encompasses public as well as private not-for-profit hospitals. Public hospital deci-
sion makers may be expected to place greater weight on promoting access to hos-
pitals, especially for low-income persons. Also, private not-for-profit hospitals 
need to break even or nearly so. Public hospitals may have a higher allocable deficit 
per patient stay, with the loss being made up by a public subsidy. Public hospitals 
break even, but a large part of revenue comes from the public sponsor of the 
hospital. 
 6.3 
 Hospital Ownership and Performance 
 Why Are For-Profit Hospitals a Minority? 
 Whether the hospital is organized as a for-profit organization or as some other form 
affects both the hospital decision-making process and actual decisions. But why 
are only a minority of hospitals organized as for-profit organizations? Countries 
differ appreciably in the relative shares of public and private not-profit hospitals. 
Generally, the public sector dominates in low- and middle-income countries,  4 
but the private not-for-profit sector tends to be larger in many high-income 
countries. 5 
 One might attribute the preponderance of private not-for-profit and govern-
ment hospitals to historical factors, but this type of explanation is not very satisfy-
ing. One puzzling fact is that personal health care services other than hospital care 
are often provided by for-profit organizations. Physicians in many countries prac-
tice as for-profit organizations. With few exceptions (e.g., public vaccine manufac-
turers), pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are for-profit. We put 
this puzzle aside for a moment to consider answers economists have given to the 
question of why alternatives to the for-profit organizational form are dominant in 
hospital sectors. 
 Fiduciary Relationships and Complex Output 
 In a seminal article on distinctive features of health care, Kenneth  Arrow (1963)  
argued that the not-for-profit form is a response to a market failure in the health 
care sector. Ideally, people would be able to purchase insurance, which would 
cover the cost of restoring an individual ’ s health to the level that prevailed before 
a health shock, such as a heart attack, occurred. People are able to buy such insur-
ance for other hazards. For example, insurance covers the cost of restoring a

damaged automobile to its state before the collision or the injury victim is given 
cash, which is equivalent in value to the automobile prior to the collision. 
Health insurers are not in a position to guarantee that they will restore the insured 
individual to the state existing before an accident or illness occurred. Rather, per-
sonal health care services are covered without any guarantee that the person ’ s 
health will be as good as new after therapy. For this reason, it is important that 
people can trust health care providers to act in the best interests of their patients. 
At the very least, providers can focus on doing their best, and not be sidetracked 
by considerations of financial self-interest. Consumers may view organizations 
that do not place profit making as their primary objective as more trustworthy 
than those that view profit maximization as their overriding organizational 
objective. 
 The importance of trust is made even more important given the complex 
output of hospitals. Often when a patient is admitted to a hospital, neither the 
underlying diagnosis nor the appropriate course of therapy is known. Given the 
rapid pace at which decisions are often made and the fact that patients may often 
not be well positioned to make fully informed decisions under these circumstances, 
it is important that patients can trust that hospital personnel are making those 
decisions that patients would make if they were fully informed and able to make 
decisions, and that hospital personnel do not place cost saving ahead of concern 
for what is best for the patient. A profit-seeking hospital, by contrast, may have a 
greater incentive to cut corners or promote therapeutic alternatives that are more 
profitable to the hospital but not necessarily better for the patient. 
 In an important sense, hospital care is an experience good (see chapter 5). 
However, while for the consumption of restaurant services, a patron who is not 
satisfied with the taste of the food at a restaurant may not return, a hospitalized 
patient who experiences a serious adverse outcome in a hospital may die, thus 
precluding future options. 
 Noncontractible Quality 
 Many aspects of quality are easily observed by the parties involved in a transaction. 
Patrons of a restaurant can monitor the appearance of the food, its tastiness, variety, 
and whether or not it is served at the appropriate temperature. However, the bacte-
rial count of the food is not readily observable and perhaps may only be observable 
if and after the patron suffers from food poisoning. Without minimizing the aggra-
vation of food poisoning, we note that at least such adverse outcomes are observ-
able soon after the meal is over. 
 Similarly, some aspects of hospital care are readily observable: the attractive-
ness of the rooms, the food, whether or not staff members come quickly when called 
by patients, and the attitudes of hospital personnel. Because these product attri-
butes are observable to patients and their families as consumers, these aspects of 
quality are contractible. 

240 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 However, many aspects are not nearly as readily observable by patients, for 
example, the accuracy with which radiographs are interpreted or the quality of 
laboratory personnel. Some medical errors may be immediately apparent, but 
others may only become evident sometime after the hospitalization, such as 
whether or not all cancer cells were removed during cancer surgery. 
 Profit-seeking organizations may be more easily tempted to skimp on the cost 
of care and the quality of inputs, which are not as easily monitored by patients, 
than organizations set up according to a different objective.  Hart, Shleifer, and 
Vishny (1997 ), who did not apply their conceptual analysis specifically to hospitals 
but rather to a range of institutions, suggested, for example, that a for-profit prison 
might skimp on input quality since the patrons, the prisoners, are not well posi-
tioned to seek an alternative provider of prison services.  6 Quality can be contract-
ible only when either its provision can be enforced contractually or unsatisfied 
customers can switch to a competitor that provides quality at the level the customer 
demands without suffering undue harm. For the same reason that, with a few 
exceptions, prisons are not-for-profit, and most hospitals are not organized on this 
basis either. 
 Public Goods 
 For private goods, consumption by one individual reduces the amount that another 
individual can consume of the same good. By contrast, with a public good, an 
individual can consume the good without diminishing its use by others.  7 In eco-
nomic terminology, consumption of the good is not  rival . 
 Most hospital care falls in the category of a rival or private good. After one 
patient  “ consumes ”  a given surgical procedure, another patient cannot consume 
it. However, some hospital outputs are public goods. For example, hospitals gener-
ally maintain some excess capacity to be used in a large-scale medical emergency, 
such as an accident involving several motor vehicles. Hospitals may be involved 
in public health campaigns of various types. Unless explicitly compensated for 
this, a for-profit hospital would generally be unwilling to provide public goods. Of 
course, even a for-profit hospital might engage in some public good provision as a 
type of advertising. If the for-profit hospital can convince potential patients that 
it is community-oriented, not a crass profit seeker, this could be good for its 
business. 
 Implicit Subsidies 
 In the Newhouse model, hospitals typically provide more quality than a profit-
maximizing hospital would provide. In essence, such higher quality is cross-sub-
sidized by the hospital forgoing profits it could have realized if it had not provided 
so much quality. Cross subsidies involve transferring funds from one profitable 
activity to another less profitable or unprofitable activity. Some hospital services 
or some types of patients have traditionally been unprofitable or relatively less 
6.  We explain this 
model in detail in 
chapter 13.
7.  See chapter 1 for a 
discussion of public 
goods.

Hospitals 
 241
profitable, for example, obstetric care in contrast to cardiac care. An argument 
against the for-profit form is that some of these subsidized activities are highly 
socially worthwhile but will only be provided if they can be cross-subsidized 
( Weisbrod 1988 ). The argument is that society desires that certain activities take 
place, although there is no willingness to make explicit payments to provide finan-
cial support for them. 
 Economists have sometimes countered this argument, which contends that 
the existence of implicit subsidies allows hospitals to support hospital decision 
makers ’  pet projects but ones that are not really favored by the citizenry more 
generally. 
 Explicit Subsidies 
 Even if tax law permitted deductions for charitable giving to for-profit organiza-
tions, it seems unlikely that donors would be predisposed to make donations, 
which would have the effect of enriching shareholders. By contrast, not-for-profit 
organizations do not have shareholders. Thus, to the extent that society wishes that 
the preferences of voluntary contributors be honored, it makes sense to have recipi-
ent organizations, such as hospitals, be not-for-profit. 
 Cartels 
 The Pauly-Redisch model of the hospital describes the private not-for-profit hos-
pital as a physicians ’ cooperative. The more pejorative term cartel may also apply 
to such an organization. The private not-for-profit form possibly facilitates cartel-
izing in two ways. First, there is no competition with shareholders for the residual 
(profit). Second, the physicians can enjoy the benefits of favorable tax treatment 
that are provided to such organizations. 
 Low Profits 
 Finally, the share of hospitals under for-profit ownership may be low because 
profits are insufficient for such hospitals to enter the market. And given the absence 
of for-profit hospitals, other types of hospitals fill the gap. In the United States, 
however, hospitals have been profitable, particularly in certain years ( American 
Hospital Association 2002 ). 
 Empirical Evidence on Hospital Ownership and Performance 
 Allegations against For-Profit Hospitals 
 In the United States in particular, where publicly traded for-profit hospital com-
panies have gained a foothold, for-profit hospitals have come under attack. The 
critics of for-profit hospitals have voiced several concerns, including lack of com-
munity benefit, cream skimming, diversion, and exploitation ( Hyman 1998 ). Lack 
of community benefit refers to the claim that for-profit hospitals do not produce 

242 
 Part II / Chapter 6
their share of public goods, such as provision of charity care to indigent patients, 
or medical education or biomedical or clinical research, for which they do not 
receive an explicit public subsidy.  “ Cream skimming ” refers to an allegation that 
for-profit hospitals locate in geographic areas in which mainly relatively affluent 
persons live ( Norton and Staiger 1994 ), have a focus on profitable services, and 
eschew providing services that are not profitable or caring for patients who ex ante 
(i.e., before the patient is admitted) appear to be unprofitable to the hospital. Diver-
sion implies that for-profit hospitals allocate too much to administration, market-
ing, and taxes — spending that could have been more productively allocated to 
providing patient care ( Woolhandler and Himmelstein 1997 ). Exploitation can be 
construed to mean that for-profit hospitals charge higher prices, channel demand 
to their facilities, including facilities that treat patients after they are discharged 
from the hospital, and may even induce demand. It has also been alleged that for-
profit hospitals upcode diagnoses with the express purpose of obtaining higher 
payments from the government ( Silverman and Skinner 2004 ). 
 Upcoding diagnoses means that hospitals figure out the algorithms used by 
insurers for purposes of determining payment. There is often some discretion in 
how a patient ’ s diagnoses are coded. The hospital knows that if it uses certain 
codes or presents the codes in a certain rank order, it will receive higher payment. 
It is not that hospitals falsely state the diagnoses that led to the patient ’ s admission 
to a hospital. Rather, it knows that some codes pay more than others, and it can 
use these codes or order of codes to obtain a higher payment. For example, a patient 
may have two or more diagnoses. Listing one before the others may yield a higher 
payment than if the others are listed first. 
 As with many important controversies, there is another side. The most 
common arguments relate to efficiency and standardization. Since for-profit hos-
pitals have well-defined residual claimants, in a closely held, non-publicly traded 
hospital company, the owners may be physicians or other entrepreneurs who 
started the hospital. For publicly traded hospital companies, the owners are mainly 
shareholders with no direct role in provision of hospital services. Owner-
shareholders presumably have a stake in having a profitable company and are not 
tolerant of inefficiency. The residual claimants in the case of hospitals not operated 
on a for-profit basis are not nearly as well defined, except perhaps in the Pauly-
Redisch framework. Officially, a not-for-profit hospital is affiliated with a religious 
organization or a community in which it is located. But perhaps a religious orga-
nization or a community will have less incentive to monitor efficiency. Likewise, 
for public hospitals, the ultimate residual claimant is the taxpayer, but taxpayers 
have much to worry about other than the efficiency of hospitals run by the govern-
ments to which they pay taxes. 
 Another aspect of efficiency relates to scale economies. It is asserted that 
being part of a chain of hospitals is a source of scale economies. There may be 
scale economies in data management, for example, but the scale economies have 
not yet been documented empirically. 

Hospitals 
 243
 Standardization means that for hospitals in a chain, various features are the 
same. When a consumer goes to a fast-food restaurant or a hotel that is part of a 
chain, he or she is likely to have some idea about the quality and type of service 
to expect in advance of actually consuming the service. Such familiarity facilitates 
consumer search and is efficiency enhancing. On the other hand, standardization 
may limit the responsiveness of hospitals in the chain to variations in the prefer-
ences of local populations. 
 There is now a vast empirical literature on the relative performance of hos-
pitals by ownership form. We start with a discussion of one study of the issue to 
illustrate how such studies are done. Then we review the findings of a much larger 
number of studies on the issue. 
 Empirical Analysis of the Effects of Ownership on Hospital Performance 
 In  “ Hospital Ownership and Cost and Quality of Care: Is There a Dime ’ s Worth 
of Difference? ”  Sloan, Picone, Taylor, et al. (2001)  investigated how for-profit 
hospitals in the United States compare on cost and quality. That for-profit hospitals 
would differ in quality from their private not-for-profit counterparts is suggested 
theoretically by the Newhouse model. The empirical analysis of Sloan et al. 
was limited to data on persons over age 65 enrolled in Medicare, the public 
insurance program covering persons over age 65 in the United States, who were 
admitted to hospitals with a primary diagnosis of hip fracture, stroke, coronary 
heart disease, or congestive heart failure — common diagnoses among elderly 
persons who are admitted to hospitals. The outcome measures studied were: sur-
vival, changes in functional and cognitive status, and changes in living arrange-
ments (e.g., admission to a nursing home). Survival was measured at one month, 
six months, and one year following admission to the hospital. Presumably, if hos-
pital quality is better, the probability of survival will be higher, holding many other 
factors constant. 
 Functional status refers to the person ’ s ability to physically and mentally 
perform various activities of daily living, such as bathing, shopping, and doing 
one ’ s laundry. Cognitive status refers to the person ’ s ability to reason and think 
through problems. The conditions for which the patients were admitted often have 
long-run adverse effects on functional and cognitive status. Stroke is associated 
with dementia. Through pathways that have not been well documented, elderly 
persons with hip fractures not only often have more limited physical function as 
a permanent condition following hip fractures but often suffer cognitive decline as 
well. The quality of care received in the first few days of a hospital stay may affect 
the patient ’ s functional and cognitive status in the long run. 
 The question the authors addressed is whether or not the decline in function 
and cognition is less if the patient is admitted to one of the hospital ownership 
types than to the others. Persons who are more functionally or cognitively impaired 
may not be able to live alone, and thus move to living with children or to a nursing 

244 
 Part II / Chapter 6
home or other facility in which assistance with tasks of daily life is provided. In 
effect, an elderly person ’ s living arrangement is another proxy for functional and 
cognitive status, which is good to have, since there may be measurement errors in 
any single scale, and it is important to know how robust findings are to changes 
in use of a particular scale. 
 The authors also measured payments Medicare made on behalf of the patient 
starting with the day the patient was admitted to the hospital through six months 
following the admission date. The six-month period included the Medicare pay-
ments for the hospital stay and payments by Medicare after the patient was dis-
charged from the hospital. Post-discharge payments included payments for 
physicians ’  services, nursing home stays, home health care, visits to hospital out-
patient clinics, readmissions to hospitals, and hospice care. 
 Although Medicare paid hospitals a fixed amount per case for a particular 
diagnosis, hospitals may be able to secure higher payment by manipulating the 
diagnosis codes or transferring the patient to a facility that is paid on some other 
basis, such as a nursing home for posthospital care to which payment is per day. A 
profit-seeking hospital may be more inclined to discharge a patient from the hospital 
early, which would not have adversely affected the payment for the stay but would 
have increased payments made to the hospital if the hospital owned the facility to 
which the patient was transferred. For each patient in their sample, the authors 
tracked all payments made by Medicare on behalf of the patient from the day the 
patient was admitted to the hospital to six months after the admission date. 
 The authors found no difference in the probabilities of patient survival 
according to the ownership of the hospital to which the person was initially admit-
ted following a health shock. With a few exceptions, they did not find statistically 
significant differences in the other health outcome measures either. 
 However, Medicare spent much more if the person had been admitted to a 
for-profit hospital for one of the conditions included in the study. The authors 
concluded that  “ for-profit hospitals were more expensive to Medicare, especially 
in terms of payments other than for the index hospitalizations.  8 The higher cash 
flow to for-profits plausibly reflects their greater incentive to maximize reimburse-
ments from payers by various means including formal and informal contractual 
relationships with suppliers of health care services ” ( Sloan, Picone, Taylor, et al. 
2001 , 18). By  “ formal and informal contractual relationships, ” the authors mean 
owning or other affiliating with a provider other than a hospital — a nursing home, 
a hospice, or a home health agency. Services rendered by the latter types of provid-
ers are covered by Medicare, especially following a hospital stay. 
 Reviews of the Literature on the Effects of Ownership on Hospital 
Performance 
 There are two systematic reviews of the evidence in the literature on studies of 
adverse health outcomes following hospitalization.  Devereaux, Choi, Lachetti, 
8.  The index 
hospitalization was the 
hospital stay for which 
the person was entered 
into the analysis 
sample.

Hospitals 
 245
et al. (2002 ) concluded that the evidence overall shows that for-profit hospitals 
have a slightly worse record on patients surviving treatment at their facilities rela-
tive to private not-for-profit facilities. On the other hand,  Eggleston, Shen, Lau, et 
al. (2008 ), based on a summary of a far larger number of empirical studies, empha-
sized differences in methodologies among studies as a major source of the differ-
ences in findings. Judging from the display of information in their study, even when 
researchers found a statistically significant difference in survival probability by 
ownership type, the difference was very small. 
 In contrast to quality or outcomes as endpoints, there is little debate among 
experts over the relatively costliness of for-profit hospitals. Despite the arguments 
of advocates of for-profit hospitals, there is no evidence that potential efficiency 
gains have been realized. Of course, one can always argue that such hospitals are 
better in satisfying the wants of patients. But the argument that they provide a 
better match with patient preferences has not been rigorously demonstrated, either. 
 Our discussion of hospital ownership thus far has implicitly assumed that all 
hospitals with a particular form of ownership act alike. There is empirical evidence 
that private not-for-profit hospitals behave differently, more like for-profits, when 
they face competition from for-profits (see, e.g.,  Duggan 2002 ). Other literature 
relates changes in behavior to changes in ownership and observes that hospitals 
learn from experience. In one study ( Picone, Chou, and Sloan 2002) , hospitals 
converting to for-profit status cut costs following conversion, which was followed 
by an increase in patient mortality and an increase in cost attributable to an 
increase in hospital input levels. 
 6.4 
 Regulation of Hospitals 
 Context 
 One of the major health policy lessons from the twentieth century is that an infu-
sion of funds into the health sector without simultaneously implementing cost 
controls will inevitably lead to high rates of increased spending on health care 
services. For example, in 1966 the United States implemented Medicare, public 
insurance for the elderly and severely disabled, and Medicaid, public insurance 
for the indigent, without simultaneously introducing cost controls ( Finkelstein 
2007 ). By 1972, public policy makers were already surprised by the rapid rise in 
spending on these public programs, far greater than had been anticipated by the 
actuaries who estimated program cost prior to implementation of the programs. 
Since the most complete coverage was for hospital care, increased spending was 
most evident in this sector. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, US states and the 
federal government began to implement hospital cost-containment programs ( Sloan 
1980 ). 

246 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 By contrast, Taiwan implemented national health insurance in 1995 with 
little or no subsequent increase in spending. The key difference between the two 
countries is that Taiwan, which had the advantage of benefiting from other coun-
tries ’ experiences, coupled the increase in coverage with implementation of strict 
controls over hospital revenues (see chapter 12). 
 The following discussion assumes that hospitals are independent entities and 
hence subject to external regulation and payment. However, as explained in detail 
in chapter 13, in some countries, hospitals are run by the government and are not 
independent entities. In the United States, many hospitals are government-owned; 
they receive public funds from the entity that owns the hospital as well as from 
higher levels of government. This has led to unintended consequences, as described 
in   box 6.1 . We defer further discussion of public hospitals to chapter 13.  
 Box 6.1 
 Intergovernmental Transfers, Fiscal Shenanigans, and Hospital Patient Mortality 
 Intergovernmental transfers, that is, transfers from a higher level of government, such 
as a national government, to a lower level of government, such as a state, county, or 
municipality, are quite common. There are at least three justifications for such trans-
fers of funds. First, there may be widespread interest in promoting a particular activity 
at a more local level. Second, there may be a motive to redistribute money from more 
affluent areas to areas in which people are less affluent. Third, higher levels of gov-
ernment may be more efficient in collecting tax revenue. However, there is wide-
spread concern that transfers of public funds from a higher level to a lower level of 
government may substitute for, or in economic terminology  “ crowd out, ” spending 
by the lower level of government. 
 In the United States, as described more fully in other chapters, Medicaid is a 
federal-state program that focuses on financing care for individuals living in low-
income households. The federal government sets broad standards for Medicaid, such 
as standards for eligibility, while each state develops more detailed standards and 
program characteristics on its own that are consistent with the federal standards. 
 One mechanism for funding hospitals under Medicaid is the Disproportionate 
Share (DSH) Program. The purpose of this program is to provide funding to hospitals 
that care for large numbers of indigent persons. DSH, like Medicaid more generally, 
is financed by a federal-state matching formula. 
 Baicker and Staiger (2005)  investigated the extent to which states could use the 
DSH federal-state matching formula to their advantage. Government hospitals operat-
ing in cities and counties have historically provided substantial amounts of care to 
indigent persons. Some funding for these facilities is raised locally, but a substantial 
amount of funding comes from intergovernmental transfers, such as from state to local 
governments. States are required by Medicaid to match federal contributions to DSH. 
But rather than have the DSH funds represent an additional source of funding for 
these hospitals, states have effectively used funds they would otherwise have spent 
on local government hospitals for matching purposes. 

Hospitals 
 247
 To illustrate, suppose a state made a $25 million annual contribution to a local 
hospital. After DSH was implemented, the state labeled the $25 million a match. 
Therefore, in the extreme, the hospital could receive a $25 million contribution from 
the federal government without the state spending any extra funds (assuming a 50-50 
match, which is the match for many states). The authors found that this type of 
practice was widespread following implementation of DSH. These are the  “ fiscal 
shenanigans. ” 
 Given this result, Baicker and Staiger asked a second question. Were patient out-
comes at hospitals improved as a result of the DSH program? Of course, to the extent 
that there were fiscal shenanigans, outcomes should have improved less than they 
otherwise would have improved. A program structured like DSH would be expected 
to improve patient outcomes for at least two reasons. First, indigent persons are likely 
to be relatively sensitive to changes in hospital quality. Second, quality should 
improve not only for these patients but for more affluent patients as well since the 
increase in DSH funds, net of the shenanigans, is likely to be used to improve facili-
ties and upgrade staffing, which in turn should lead to improved quality, on average. 
The authors measured changes in mortality for two types of patients, infants and 
persons admitted to hospitals for heart attacks. In both cases, DSH led to better out-
comes. These results are plausible since despite the crowding out of funds, DSH did 
lead to some increased funding of hospital services for large numbers of indigent 
persons. 
Box 6.1

 Retrospective Cost Reimbursement 
 In many countries, hospitals are paid on a  retrospective cost  basis. For example, 
when first implemented, Medicare, like some other major private health insurers 
in the United States, paid hospitals on this cost basis. What this means is if a hos-
pital incurred a dollar of expense and Medicare accounted for, say, 35 percent of 
that hospital ’ s patient load, the hospital would be entitled to a payment of $0.35. 
If the expense were $2.00, the hospital would be entitled to a payment of $0.70 
from Medicare. The system was retrospective in that hospitals were paid for their 
expenses after the expenses were incurred. During the year, hospitals would receive 
payments based on a cost projection. However, after the year, hospital accountants 
would finalize data on expenses incurred, and a final settlement would be made 
based on this number. A hospital that wasted its resources would be entitled to a 
higher payment from insurers like Medicare. Hospitals therefore had little incen-
tive to be efficient. Higher costs generated higher revenue for the hospital. 
 If the vast majority of a hospital ’ s patients have insurance and the payment 
by the insurers for care provided by the hospital is not fixed, that is, it is 
paid based on actual costs incurred after they are incurred (retrospective cost 

248 
 Part II / Chapter 6
reimbursement), the stage is set for a  “ medical arms race. ” The arms race, non-price 
competition rather than competition based on price, works as follows. 
 When people have nearly complete insurance coverage for hospital care, 
the demand for such care is very inelastic. Both industry demand and hospital 
demand are inelastic. From the vantage point of the hospital, incurring higher 
cost leads to higher revenue. The hospital wants to attract patients. But to do this, 
it needs to attract patient referrals from the physicians in the community. The 
hospital has no financial incentive to say no to a demand by physicians that it 
acquire some new expensive equipment that the physician wants for his or her 
hospital practice. In fact, the hospital knows that the insurers will cover the acqui-
sition and operating cost of such equipment. Hence, the hospital has every incen-
tive to say yes to physician demands. If the hospital refuses to go along with the 
physician ’ s demand, the physician may admit his or her patients to another hos-
pital in the community. Since the physician ’ s threat is more credible if there are 
other hospitals in the community, the medical arms race is worse when there 
are several hospital competitors. In communities in which a single hospital has a 
monopoly, the hospital can reason that the physician has no other option but 
to admit patients to its facility. The patients may not care about hospital costs 
and prices, but they will care if they are likely to travel to another community 
for care. 
 Normally, increased competition would lower cost and the difference between 
price and the cost of producing a good or service ( “ price-cost margins ” ). But with 
cost-based reimbursement and nearly complete insurance coverage (meaning that 
the patient pays little or nothing out of pocket for care), increased competition has 
the opposite result. As cost rises, quality may rise. But even if it does, it may be 
much higher than is socially optimal. A higher than socially optimal level of quality 
arises when the marginal willingness to pay for one unit increase in quality is less 
than its marginal cost. Furthermore, hospitals have an incentive to acquire plant 
and equipment that may be underutilized. Under retrospective cost-based reim-
bursement, if only ten patients use an item of equipment during the year, the cost 
of the equipment (debt service, depreciation, rental if the hospital rents rather than 
owns the equipment) would be allocated among the insurers in the same way as 
if 1,000 patients had utilized it. 
 The astute reader is likely to ask, if the system was so flawed, why have so 
many insurers around the world, both private and public, implemented it at one 
time or other, and why is the system for paying hospitals commonplace in many 
countries, even today? 
 Retrospective cost reimbursement makes sense when output and the process 
of producing the output are difficult to specify in advance. Imagine the task of 
developing new aircraft for combat missions. Especially when a country is at war, 
the aircraft is badly needed for combat. Manufacturers would not agree to develop 
the aircraft for a fixed price since it is not at all clear how difficult it will be to 

Hospitals 
 249
develop new aircraft that fulfills the government ’ s requirements or, if the govern-
ment is in a hurry to obtain the aircraft, how costly it will be to accelerate develop-
ment and manufacturing processes. So rather than offer fixed price contracts, the 
government offers cost-based contracts. The manufacturer ’ s cost is subject to exter-
nal audit and has to be reasonable in the view of government accountants. But if 
audit standards are met and developing the aircraft costs more than anticipated, 
the government is willing to cover the cost overrun. 
 For example, the government may not cover cocktail parties or trips to an 
exotic island for staff or even for customers, if the business purpose were not clear. 
But it may well cover cost overruns due to a project being more complex than 
anticipated even if rigorous measures of the added complexity are not presented. 
 Similarly, governments provide research grants on a retrospective cost basis 
to universities and other research entities. Research outcomes are often highly 
uncertain, and research output is often difficult to quantify even after the fact. 
Hence, there is a strong case for cost-based reimbursement in some situations. 
Universities and other research entities generally like retrospective cost reimburse-
ment, and if anything, would lobby against proposals to abolish it. 
 Advocates of retrospective cost reimbursement of hospital care argued that 
hospitalized patients are very heterogeneous, even those patients admitted with 
the same primary diagnosis. There has been some concern that paying a fixed price 
for the care of a patient with a specific diagnosis may be unfair to hospitals that 
happen to treat patients with relatively severe forms of the disease. The care of 
such patients may require relatively sophisticated technology and high levels of 
nursing care. There is a concern that, if these additional costs are not covered, 
hospitals will refuse to accept those patients who require extra care. 
 In countries with pluralistic financing systems, methods of payment tend to 
be pluralistic as well (see chapter 11). In the United States historically, some health 
insurers paid hospitals on a retrospective cost basis. Other insurers paid based on 
hospital prices (charges). These insurers paid a percentage of hospital charges or 
a fixed dollar amount per covered service (e.g., $X for an appendectomy, called an 
 “ indemnity ” ), with the patient paying the difference between the fixed dollar 
amount and the hospital ’ s charge out of pocket. When the insurer paid on the basis 
of a percentage of hospital charges, the hospital could know that the insurer ’ s pay-
ments would rise if the hospital raised its costs and prices or just its prices. In 
this important sense, charge-based reimbursement strongly resembles cost-based 
reimbursement. 
 Regulatory Responses 
 Most countries in the world with substantial health insurance coverage for hospital 
care and with cost-based reimbursement of hospitals have implemented some form 
of regulation to temper the rise in spending on hospital care. As a result, cost-based 
reimbursement of hospitals without controls has become a rarity. 

250 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 The major forms of hospital cost-containment controls consist of entry regula-
tion and price and revenue regulation. Arguments for regulation are (1) moral 
hazard exists in the presence of health insurance and (2) some government inter-
vention is needed to counter the perverse incentives of the cost-based reimburse-
ment system. Regulation primarily arises in countries in which hospitals are mainly 
private. In a country in which hospitals are public, such as in the UK (see chapter 
13), public entities have exclusive responsibility for decision making. 
 Entry Regulation 
 Entry regulation applies to the entry of new hospitals as well as the expansion of 
services at existing hospitals.  9 The concept has been applied in sectors other than 
health care. For example, routes of bus lines and airlines may be regulated, as may 
the entry of new bus and airline companies. Similarly, the entry of liquor stores 
and bars is often subject to government regulation. A major argument for entry 
regulation is that  “ excess competition ” is not in the public interest. Excess com-
petition includes the medical arms race, but it may also apply in industries in 
which price wars lead to insolvencies. While excess competition of this sort may 
be undesirable, particularly in such sectors as insurance ( Munch and Smallwood 
1980 ), there is also a risk that entry regulation provides a de facto franchise 
for incumbents in an industry. In fact, the major advocates for such regulation are 
often incumbents. 
 In some countries, such as Canada and Germany, entry regulation in the 
health field is combined with capital budgeting. Capital and operating funds are 
available only if the regulatory agency approves the project. In the United States, 
the two functions are separate. In the US states with such regulation, hospital 
capital projects meeting the criteria for regulation must be approved by a public 
agency before construction can begin. Building a hospital or acquiring equipment 
without approval is illegal. The applicant for regulatory approval of a capital 
project presents its plans for financing the project. However, applicants obtain 
financing from banks, bond issues, and internal funds. Governments have no 
capital budgets for hospital plant and equipment purchases. 
 In principle, there is a strong case that entry regulation can combat hospitals ’ 
incentives under retrospective reimbursement to acquire plants and equipment. To 
gain regulatory approval, a hospital must present detailed plans and projections of 
use and show that the investment is needed. Going ahead with investments that 
are not approved can be an outright violation of the law, or place payments to 
hospitals from government health insurance plans in jeopardy. 
 In the United States, entry regulation takes the form of state certificate of need 
(CON) laws. For many years, states were required under federal law to enact CON 
laws. However, the federal law is no longer in effect, and several states have con-
sequently dropped their CON laws. State CON laws cover several types of health 
9.  For a much more 
detailed review of the 
US experience with 
hospital regulation, 
see  Salkever (2000) .

Hospitals 
 251
care services, including hospitals, but they exclude physicians ’ private offices. 
Under cost-based reimbursement, as we have seen, there is an incentive to build 
various forms of hospital capacity with the knowledge that health insurers will 
foot the bill even if the capacity is not demanded and is underutilized. 
 Central to these laws is the notion that the need for facilities can be defined 
for a particular geographic area.  “ Need ”  is not a word in the vocabulary of econom-
ics. Economists distinguish between  “ need ” and  “ demand. ” To economists, it 
seems unlikely that a fixed number of facilities is  “ required ”  for a given population. 
There are substitutes for hospital care, including ambulatory care. This means that 
as hospitals raise their prices, purchasers will find other sources of care when it 
is feasible to do so. 
 Historically, CON agencies in the United States have specified specific stan-
dards to which CON applicants must adhere, notably, that bed construction not 
result in a community with more than four beds per 1,000 population. But critics 
of CON ask what would happen if a community had 3.5 or 4.5 beds per 1,000 
population? Presumably the marginal benefit of beds declines as beds are added, 
but it seems more reasonable to assume that marginal benefit declines in a smooth 
fashion rather than only at a specific bed ratio. Further, it is likely that communi-
ties differ in the extent to which they derive benefits from adding hospital capacity, 
and not only because of differences in the demographic composition of the com-
munity, a factor the CON review process generally considers. Under complete or 
nearly complete health insurance coupled with cost-based reimbursement, there 
may well be overinvestment in hospital capacity. But basing allocations of hospital 
capacity on fixed predetermined ratios does not ensure socially optimal levels of 
investment either. 
 In recent years in the United States, CON ’ s programmatic emphasis has been 
expanded to include access to care and to quality of care. The argument for a role 
for public regulation to safeguard access is that a free market results in an inequi-
table distribution of capacity. In particular, hospitals will want to locate in parts 
of the city where middle-income and high-income persons live and will not want 
to locate in impoverished neighborhoods. CON programs can prevent hospitals 
from locating or relocating in more affluent areas. Also, CON can impose require-
ments that hospitals provide minimum amounts of care to the poor or to persons 
without health insurance as a prerequisite for obtaining a certificate. However, the 
extent to which such provisions are enforced after the facility is built is unknown. 
 As for quality, there is a vast literature on the relationship between the quan-
tity of services provided by a hospital and health outcomes. Under cost-based 
reimbursement and similar payment systems, there is likely to be a proliferation 
of hospitals offering a particular type of service, in particular a particular surgical 
procedure, such as open heart surgery. Hospitals, and surgeons at these facilities, 
that undertake low numbers of specialized sophisticated procedures are not likely 

252 
 Part II / Chapter 6
to have the good health outcomes that their counterparts with a higher volume 
have. As in other areas, practice makes perfect. Further, there are important fixed 
costs in running programs for some complex procedures. For example, for open 
heart surgery, not only is the equipment expensive but a certain number of special-
ized personal must be available at all times. In a low-volume program, equipment 
and staff are likely to be idle much of the time. 
 The empirical evidence on the effectiveness of CON programs in the United 
States in constraining the growth in hospital cost has been mixed, with some 
studies suggesting that CON has actually increased spending on hospital care. 
Before turning to the evidence, it is useful to consider why entry regulation may 
not have the intended cost-constraining effect. 
 First and most important, in the United States, the agency that approves 
capital expenditures does not have a budget for capital expenditures. Thus, the 
agency stands to face political opposition from the hospital and its allies when a 
CON application is declined. Yet in approving a hospital ’ s application, the agency 
does not bear any direct cost consequences from its decision. 
 Second, the CON applicant has a major stake in the outcome of its applica-
tion. By contrast, individual citizens have little interest and stake in the outcome 
of the review. Although having a hospital nearby may be personally advantageous 
someday, most citizen voters are not admitted to hospitals most of the time. The 
issue of patient travel time or more generally access to hospitals is likely not to be 
a very salient political issue. Opposition to a given application is not likely to come 
from the members of the public at large but rather from potential competitors of 
the applicant. CON programs favor the status quo. CON may confer a de facto 
franchise on existing hospitals. 
 Third, entry regulation does not apply across the board but only to certain 
types of facilities, including hospitals. Thus, for example, a CON program may 
deny a hospital a CON for an expensive piece of imaging equipment. Yet this barrier 
can be circumvented by acquiring the same equipment for use in physicians ’ 
offices, which are exempt from CON regulation. 
 Salkever and Bice (1976)  performed the earliest empirical analysis of the 
effects of entry regulation on hospital investment and capital stock. These authors 
found that CON constrained the growth of hospital beds in US states with CON, 
but actually increased hospital investment in plant assets per hospital bed. Salkever 
and Bice argued that CON programs had a ratio of beds to population to serve as 
a benchmark and thus could turn down applicants for hospital beds if building the 
beds would lead to a ratio in excess of four beds per 1,000. But the CON programs 
did not have explicit criteria for judging other types of investments in hospital 
capacity, such as for specialized hospital equipment, say, the number of CT scan-
ners per capita population in the hospital ’ s market or  “ catchment ”  area. Thus, 
when they lacked fixed criteria, the CON panels had more difficulty saying no to 
a hospital application. Consequently, when CON limited hospital bed construction, 

Hospitals 
 253
the funds were channeled into other types of hospital investments. These results 
were confirmed by subsequent empirical analysis ( Sloan and Steinwald 1975 ; 
 Sloan 1980 ,  1983 ), which found that CON regulation did not reduce capital expen-
ditures on hospitals or decrease other indicators of hospital spending. 
 Many US states have been reluctant to discontinue their CON programs even 
after federal law permitted them to do so. Many states did drop CON. The concern 
among the states that retained CON has been that removing CON would lead to a 
surge in health care spending, including spending on hospital care. If CON pro-
grams had really been effective in constraining spending, this would be a legitimate 
concern. However, the empirical evidence does not support the view that CON has 
been effective in cost containment.  Conover and Sloan (1998)  investigated whether 
or not states that dropped CON experienced a surge in health care spending sub-
sequently. Based on their empirical analysis, they concluded that concerns about 
a surge are unfounded. 
 Much less is known about CON ’ s impacts on access to and the quality of 
hospital care than about its effect on hospital cost and spending on hospital care. 
In the CON application process, some weight may be given to the potential effects 
on access of underserved populations, including the uninsured. However, 
how important are these considerations in the  actual  approval process, and what 
mechanisms do states employ to ensure promises are kept? It is often asserted by 
program officials and advocates for CON that access is an important consideration 
in CON approval of projects, but systematically assembled empirical evidence is 
lacking. 
 Custer, Ketsche, Sherman, et al. (2006,  274) studied data on individual hos-
pitals to analyze the relationship between CON and the share of inpatients classi-
fied as  “ self-pay, ” that is, those who have no health insurance coverage and 
therefore pay for care out of pocket. The authors did not find that CON programs 
increased the share of such persons admitted to hospitals. A related but conceptu-
ally distinct issue pertains to the geographic distribution of hospital inpatient and 
outpatient facilities. In particular, does CON improve the geographic distribution 
of such facilities, such as addressing an imbalance in distribution of hospital facili-
ties relative to population between large cities and rural areas? Up to now, there 
have been no empirical studies of this issue. 
 There is solid empirical evidence that health outcomes are better in hospital 
facilities that have higher volume for several services, in particular cardiac services. 
 Birkmeyer, Siewers, Finlayson, et al. (2002) showed that very high-volume facilities 
achieved substantial, and statistically significant, surgical mortality reductions for 
coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) ( – 20 percent), aortic valve replacements ( – 24 
percent), and mitral valve replacements ( – 23 percent). 
 Moreover, studies have examined the impact of CON on outcomes following 
CABG surgery. One study focused on the determinants of surgical mortality 
for CABG procedures performed during 1994 – 1999 in the United States 

254 
 Part II / Chapter 6
( Vaughan-Sarrazin, Hannan, Gormley, et al. 2002 ). Mortality adjusted for differ-
ences in case mix severity by hospital was 22 percent higher in eighteen states 
that had no CON regulation of open-heart surgery units during this period com-
pared to twenty-six states that maintained such regulation during the entire 
period. Mean patient volume per center was 84 percent higher in states with CON 
regulation than in those without, supporting the idea that CON led to improve-
ments in outcomes by regionalizing facilities. While this study controlled exten-
sively for various patient characteristics, it did not control for other factors that 
may have affected health outcomes. Moreover, the use of cross-sectional data 
limited the authors ’ ability to reach conclusions about cause and effect, as it is 
conceivable that states without CON regulation of open heart surgery (coronary 
artery bypass graft, CABG) had worse surgical outcomes for reasons unrelated 
to CON. 
 A different study compared the outcomes of persons undergoing CABG from 
three years prior to the US state of Pennsylvania ’ s elimination of CON to three 
years after ( Robinson, Nash, Moxey, et al. 2001 ). Despite a 25 percent increase in 
the number of open heart surgery programs after CON was lifted, the authors found 
no statistically significant difference in the number of CABG operations performed 
statewide or any difference in the mortality experience of hospitals that were 
approved under CON to perform CABG compared to those that implemented CABG 
surgery programs following CON ’ s removal. 
 A strength of this study is its longitudinal comparison focusing on the impact 
of lifting CON. The disadvantage is that it is a case study of a single US state, one 
that happened to also have a statewide public performance monitoring system that 
included hospital reporting of CABG outcomes. In the absence of this reporting 
system, the results may have been very different. 
 Nevertheless, despite the limitations of past research on CON programs ’ 
impact on quality of care, it appears that CON programs have a favorable impact 
on the outcomes of hospitalized patients admitted with some primary diagnoses. 
But other approaches may also have a favorable impact on quality without having 
the negative feature of conferring de facto franchises on incumbents, which CON 
programs have. 
 Price-Revenue Regulation and Prospective Payment 
 Entry regulation is designed to limit a medical arms race that may occur under 
retrospective cost reimbursement of hospitals. Entry regulation is in effect a bandage 
that seeks to counter the adverse effects of retrospective cost reimbursement 
without changing the payment system itself. A more direct policy option is to 
change the payment system itself. This can be done by specifying terms of hospital 
payment before rather than after care is delivered. Payment systems that specify 
payment terms in advance are called  prospective payment  systems. 

Hospitals 
 255
 A necessary condition for paying hospitals prospectively is having a defini-
tion of the product to be paid for. Under retrospective cost reimbursement, the 
insurer pays for costs incurred by the hospital in caring for the persons it insures. 
No measure of product or output is needed. The insurer merely reimburses for 
expenses incurred on behalf of persons while they are hospitalized. The difficulty 
of arriving at a consensus about how hospital output should be measured has been 
an impediment to the adoption of hospital prospective payment. 
 Hospital output can be measured in several ways. The most detailed unit of 
output is the individual service, such as administration of a drug (e.g., aspirin or 
a fluid administered intravenously), room and board for a day, minutes the patient 
spent in the operating room, and so on. Slightly more aggregated is a patient day, 
which bundles all services performed during a 24-hour period. At the next level 
is the hospital stay, which combines the days the person spent in the hospital 
during a stay. 
 Alternatively, the hospital may be paid on a  capitation  basis. When paid on 
a capitation basis, the hospital is under contract with a health insurer and is paid 
a fixed dollar amount per year for each person in the plan, whether or not the 
person receives care at the hospital. 
 Still another approach is for the hospital to be paid a fixed amount per year 
for operating its facility, called a  global budget . This amount, set in advance of the 
year to which it applies, is designed to cover all care delivered by the hospital 
during the year. This  total budget  approach is used in Canada (see chapter 12). 
 Price and revenue regulation is a very broad category. About the only common 
feature such regulatory programs have is that payment is set in advance of service 
provision. The category encompasses price controls in which hospital prices for 
each service are frozen and subject to annual updates according to a specific 
formula, prospective payment using the day or the stay as the unit of output, capi-
tation plans, and total hospital budgeting. 
 Hospitals face substantially different incentives under prospective payment. 
Under retrospective cost reimbursement, by raising costs, hospitals generate more 
revenue. By contrast, under prospective payment, hospitals gain by reducing cost 
since payment tends to be invariant with respect to a hospital ’ s cost. 
 Each prospective payment method has advantages and disadvantages. 
Systems that use individual services as the unit of output have the advantage of 
making payment highly individualized so that payment can reflect the complexity 
of a specific patient ’ s condition and treatment. However, there are important dis-
advantages that probably outweigh this advantage. In particular, individual ser-
vices may be mispriced. If the price is set too low, there is an incentive for 
underprovision. Conversely, if the price is set too high, well above the marginal 
cost of delivering the service, hospitals have an incentive to overprovide the 
service. 

256 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 In the United States, the Nixon administration ’ s Economic Stabilization 
Program (ESP), implemented for a while in the early 1970s, began as a price freeze 
( Salkever 2000 ). All price freezes  “ work ”  in the very short run in that inflation is 
contained. However, in the longer run, important distortions emerge since 
the normal market process of price increases and decreases does not exist. For 
example, if a price is held below its market-clearing level, product shortages can 
and almost surely do ensue. After a brief period during which all prices were 
frozen, ESP substituted a system of controlled prices for the price freeze. Price 
controls, which predominated in certain sectors of the US economy, including 
health care in general and hospitals in particular, allowed for exceptions to help 
deal with shortages as they arose. When controls were lifted, a major bout of hos-
pital cost inflation ensued. Overall, the experience with price controls in the 
United States during the 1970s, as well as during World War II, is not worthy of 
repeating. 
 Alternatively, some prospective payment systems pay hospitals on a per diem 
(day) basis. Payment is for all services provided during the day. While far simpler 
to administer than a piece-rate system, per diem payment gives hospitals an 
incentive to increase length of patient stay. Typically, substantial resources are 
devoted to diagnosis and treatment during the first few days of a stay. As the patient 
remains in the hospital, the intensity of care is likely to decline. Thus, average cost 
often declines as the patient ’ s length of stay increases. If the payment is fixed and 
average cost declines with longer stays, hospitals can profit by extending patient 
stays. 
 The hospital admission or case has been used as the unit of output for 
payment, most notably by Medicare ’ s prospective payment system (PPS) in the 
United States. PPS replaced retrospective cost reimbursement that Medicare had 
used as the basis for paying hospitals previously. With the case as output, in addi-
tion to being conscious of the costs incurred in the provision of care, which applies 
to all prospective payment systems, hospitals have an incentive to reduce length 
of stay, thereby increasing profit per case since the payment it receives does not 
decline as length of stay declines. However, patients may be discharged from hos-
pitals both  “ quicker and sicker, ” although the empirical evidence indicates overall 
that the Medicare PPS system resulted in quicker discharges but not sicker patients 
following discharge. A disadvantage of using the case instead of the patient day as 
the unit of output is that payment may not track severity of disease as well as a 
per diem system does. Thus, with per case payment, the hospital is generally 
placed at a disadvantage in accepting patients with relatively severe conditions 
among those with the same diagnosis for care. 
 Capitated systems have not proved to be popular to date with hospitals or 
with the public more generally. From the hospital ’ s vantage point, under capitation, 
the organization is asked to accept a risk that the persons for whom the hospital 
receives a capitated payment may prove to be less healthy than anticipated. 

Hospitals 
 257
In addition, the hospital is being asked to undertake a risk-bearing role as an 
insurer does. The hospital may not have a sufficiently large patient base to 
adequately diversify away the risk of individual patient variation in the use of 
hospital care. 
 Global budgeting has been applied in Canada ( Rozek and Mulhern 1994 ). 10 
For example, when universal hospital insurance (Medicare) was first implemented 
in Ontario, Canada, the Ministry of Health engaged in an extensive line-by-line 
review of each hospital ’ s budget. Based on these data, the Ministry set up global 
budgets for each hospital. The global budgets, administered by the Ministry of 
Health, cover the hospital ’ s operating costs and equipment depreciation; other 
capital costs and graduate medical education are funded through other methods. 
In addition to Ministry allocations, hospitals receive approximately 20 percent of 
total hospital operating funds from sources other than those of the Ministry (e.g., 
from the workers ’ compensation program, payments for care provided to people 
living outside Ontario, differential room charges, and income from endowments 
and parking lot fees). The starting point for a hospital ’ s budget is the previous year ’ s 
funding level. The funding level is increased each year to account for four different 
areas of designated increases: inflation, growth, new and expanded services, and 
life support. The increases in the global budget to account for inflation and growth 
are set by formula, while the other two are subject to negotiations between each 
individual hospital and the Ministry. 
 The purpose of the inflation adjustment is to increase hospital budgets to 
compensate hospitals for increases in the prices they pay for hospital inputs they 
purchase. The growth payments are meant to pay hospitals for the increased costs 
resulting from increases in the volume of services they provide, such as increases 
in outpatient visits or in patient days, using existing equipment and facilities. If a 
hospital wants to add a new program or expand an old one, it must receive permis-
sion to do so from both the Ministry of Health and the local planning agency. The 
capital costs to support a new program come from fund-raising and appropriations 
from the Ministry; the operating costs associated with a program can be included 
in the budget only with Ministry approval. Many high-technology services, such 
as diagnostic imaging and laboratory services, are available only in hospitals. Thus, 
control over the hospital ’ s budget is the primary tool used to limit the growth of 
such services. A small number of programs, mainly in teaching hospitals, are des-
ignated life support programs, such as hemodialysis and cardiac surgery. The 
increase in the costs associated with these programs is funded through the life-
support program. 
 While global budgets give government substantial control over hospital 
spending, they have important disadvantages. First, inequities among hospitals 
develop over time. Hospitals with high initial budgets, due for example to ineffi-
ciency not accounted for in setting up initial budgets, tend to maintain relatively 
high budgets over time. Second, the growth payments reward hospitals that do not

global budgeting in 
Canada draws on  Lave, 
Jacobs, and Markel 
(1992 ).

reduce length of stay and otherwise maintain outputs at inefficiently high levels. 
In two provinces, there is evidence of bed blockers ( Rozek and Mulhern 1994 , 282). 
Bed blockers are patients who have been hospitalized for a long time but for whom 
the marginal cost to the hospital per extra day in the hospital is low. By having 
bed blockers, hospitals can maintain volume while reducing the average cost of 
patients in the hospital. Such cost containment runs completely counter to effi-
ciency enhancement. Third, there is no adjustment of changes in case mix either 
at the hospital level or in the hospital ’ s catchment area. One could say these are 
just details in implementation. But when there are larger numbers of hospitals in 
a particular jurisdiction, as a practical matter, it would be very difficult to custom-
ize individual hospital budgets to reflect each hospital ’ s situation and maintain 
incentives for efficiency. The Canadian province of Ontario has addressed these 
deficiencies in large part by deviating from pure global budgeting and adopting 
some features of US payment systems of hospitals. 
 There is a large body of empirical research on the performance of rate and 
revenue regulation in the hospital sector. The vast majority of empirical studies 
are for the United States. Thus, our brief overview of empirical findings focuses 
on evidence from the United States. 
 The Nixon administration ’ s ESP lasted only three years. Overall, based on the 
 “ war stories ” of ESP, this approach is unlikely to be implemented any time soon, 
except perhaps during a major war or other national crisis. However, the empirical 
findings are mixed. Studies assessing the ESP experience include  Ginsburg (1978) , 
 Sloan (1981,   1983 ),  Lanning, Morrisey, and Ohsfeldt (1991) , and  Antel, Ohsfeldt, 
and Becker (1995) . 
 Prospective payment programs implemented by a few US states (other than 
Maryland, which used individual services as outputs) used either the per diem or 
the case as the unit of output. As  Salkever (2000)  emphasized, empirical findings 
on the effect of these programs on hospital cost have varied over time. Early studies 
(e.g.,  Sloan 1980, 1983 ;  Coelen and Sullivan 1981 ) generally found that these pro-
grams reduced hospital costs below what they would have been in the absence of 
these programs. However, later studies (e.g.,  Antel, Ohsfeldt, and Becker 1995 ) 
failed to find an effect on cost. One reason for the change may be the growth of 
competitive forces in the hospital sector, described below, as well as the introduc-
tion of Medicare PPS. Over time, states have dropped rate-setting programs, which 
is consistent with the empirical evidence of a diminishing effect of such programs 
on hospital. 
 Medicare PPS applies only to Medicare, not to all sources of hospital payment 
as did the state rate-setting programs.  Antel, Ohsfeldt, and Becker (1995),  using 
state-year data for 1968 – 1990, found that if anything, PPS increased cost per hos-
pital admission. However, other studies ( Coulam and Gaumer 1991 ;  Gold, Chu, 
Felt, et al. 1993 ) found that PPS reduced hospital costs. Based on his assessment 
of the findings overall,  Salkever (2000)  concluded that PPS did reduce hospital

cost. At a minimum, PPS changed the psychology of hospital managers. No longer 
was there a reward for inefficiency. 
 6.5 
 An Alternative to Regulating Hospitals: 
Increasing Competition among Hospitals 
 Description 
 While the medical arms race represents a form of competition, it is a different form 
from what economists typically mean by competition. First, in the medical arms 
race, competition is not based on differences in competitors ’ prices. Prices are 
irrelevant to the physician ’ s decision about the hospital to which his or her patient 
is admitted. Second, generally when competition prevails in product market, the 
consumer makes informed choices based on comparisons of prices and product 
attributes. 
 The physician has tended to dominant in deciding whether and to which 
hospital the patient is admitted. In an important sense, if there is a consumer of 
hospital services, it has been the patient ’ s physician. Private or public insurers 
have had no voice in this decision. In fact, in the United States, there were 
laws preventing insurers from influencing choice of hospital. Insurer influence 
on choice of hospital was considered to be interference in the practice of medi-
cine. Given that insurers had to pay for care the patient received at any facility 
of the physician ’ s and the hospital ’ s choosing, insurers were placed at a sub-
stantial disadvantage in negotiating contracts with individual hospitals. A hospital 
could essentially force the insurer to pay virtually any cost or price the hospital 
demanded. 
 Since the early 1980s, statutory changes have resulted in a major change in 
the way that hospital care is purchased in the United States. The result has been 
an increase in hospital competition, but competition in the sense that economists 
use the term. The new system relies on competition among health insurance plans. 
Plans compete on the basis of premiums, benefit structure, and the hospitals and 
physicians affiliated with each plan. 
 The statutory change has involved enactment of  “ selective contracting ” 
laws. Under such laws, insurers can contract with fewer than all hospitals and 
physicians in a geographic area. With the power of walking away from a hospital 
that demands too high a payment, insurers have been granted substantially 
greater bargaining power vis- à -vis hospitals. An inefficient hospital now faces the 
threat of losing important contracts and hence large numbers of patients. Now, 
in contrast to the situation that prevailed under retrospective cost reimbursement 
and similar payment systems, the hospital has a much clearer incentive to be 
efficient. 

260 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 A second major development, which also occurred in the United States in 
the 1980s, was the implementation of the Medicare PPS system. In contrast to 
private health insurers, Medicare does not have the power to exclude hospitals 
from its network. But PPS pays a fixed amount per hospital stay, and the amount 
is independent of an individual hospital ’ s costs. Thus, an inefficient hospital 
potentially would provide care to Medicare beneficiaries at a loss. 
 Whereas before, with more hospitals in a market area, a medical arms race 
might have been likely to ensue, under the new, more competitive regime, more 
hospitals mean lower costs and prices, holding other factors constant. In fact, if a 
hospital has a monopoly in its market area, it would be relatively well positioned 
to negotiate with individual insurers. If an insurer wants to do business in the area, 
it has to deal with the monopolist hospital. However, under selective contracting, 
when there is competition among hospitals, insurers can exclude a hospital with 
which it cannot arrive at an agreement on prices. 
 Empirical Evidence on the Effects of Competition under the 
New Regime 
 We can view competition among hospitals in the post-PPS era in two ways: direct 
observation of change, and empirical analysis of the effects of PPS and other 
changes that accompanied PPS. 
 Prior to the 1980s, there was little competition among US hospitals. Many 
hospitals were (and many are) nonprofits in the community they served. Hospital 
marketing departments, if they existed, were small. Hospitals saw themselves to a 
greater or lesser extent as public utilities. 
 Since the 1980s, hospitals have increasingly had to bargain with insurers over 
terms of payment. Many have greatly expanded their capacity to deliver care on 
an ambulatory basis. Hospitals now frequently advertise for patients. The advertise-
ment in   figure 6.9  is an example of a major teaching hospital aiming to attract 
patients with a specialized condition (disease of a heart valve) from a geographic 
area far larger than the city where it is located. Patients with Medicare and some 
private insurance plans may be covered by insurance if they travel to a distant 
hospital for care. However, many patients would be restricted by their insurance 
policies to use hospitals in their networks.  
 Although the new system has attractive features, empirical analysis was 
needed to rigorously demonstrate its effects. 
 Robinson and Luft (1985)  assessed the effect of the medical arms race on 
hospital costs in the 1970s and early 1980s. They computed the number of com-
petitors faced by each hospital in the United States. A 15-mile radius from a hos-
pital was considered sufficiently close for another hospital to be in competition 
with the hospital in question. Controlling for a large number of other factors, they 
found that hospitals with more competitors had higher costs per admission. Simi-
larly, other studies found that hospitals with more competitors had higher ratios

of hospital employees to patients, a higher probability of having cardiac facilities 
at the hospital, and more special services, such as mammography and cobalt 
therapy (for cancer) ( Luft, Robinson, Garnick, et al. 1986 ;  Robinson, Garnick, and 
McPhee 1987 ;  Robinson 1988 ). Subsequently,  Zwanziger and Melnick (1988)  
focused on the change in the relationship among costs, technology diffusion, and 
the number of competitors after the change in payment practices introduced by 
Medicare in 1983, as well as the selective contracting law ’ s implementation in 
California in 1982, and found that the positive relationship between the number 
of competitors of a hospital and measures of hospital cost evident in 1983 had 
disappeared by 1985. 
 Keeler, Melnick, and Zwanziger (1999) , using data from the period after PPS 
was implemented, 1986 – 1994, reached the same conclusion. Over this period, the 
relationship between concentration of hospitals in a market and hospital prices 
steadily changed, with the relationship between hospital prices and competition 
in local markets being stronger toward the end than at the beginning of their obser-
vational period. 
 Keeler and co-authors measured competition within a local market in this 
study and many others measured by the  Herfindahl-Hirschman Index  (HHI), 
 HHI =  Σ s i 2 , 
(6.5) 
 where  s i is the fraction of total hospital discharges in the market that hospital  i has. 
In other studies, output has been defined as patient days rather than discharges. 
 The summation in equation 6.5 includes all hospitals in the hospital ’ s market 
area. If the hospital is a monopolist, that is, has all discharges in the market, the 
HHI is 1. If there are four hospitals with unequal number of discharges, the HHI is 
0.15 2 + 0.35 2 + 0.27 2 + 0.23 2 = 0.27, for example. As the number of hospitals in a 
market rises, the HHI approaches zero in value. The key assumption underlying 
the use of the HHI as a measure of competition is that sellers find it easier to collude 
in price-setting when the HHI is higher. 
 The conclusion that the medical arms race was important before 1983 has 
been challenged by  Dranove, Shanley, and Simon (1992) , who argued that the 
Robinson-Luft analysis was misspecified and the results could be attributed to 
confounding. By confounding, researchers mean that other variates not included 
in the model but should have been included and are systematically related to 
explanatory variables included in the model leads to biased parameter estimates 
on the included explanatory variables. 
 Although empirical evidence in support of the medical arms race hypothesis 
has been challenged, retrospective cost-based reimbursement clearly gave hospitals 
an incentive to compete by offering a broader and rich range of services. Whether 
or not the incentive per se has contributed to hospital cost inflation is another 
matter. 

Hospitals 
 263
 Empirical Evidence on the Effects of Increased Competition on 
Hospital Quality 
 A major issue with competition among hospitals is whether or not increased com-
petition leads hospitals to reduce quality or increase it. The conventional wisdom 
among health professionals decades ago was that competition reduced quality. This 
thinking relied on the view that only health professionals could judge what was 
good for patients, and patients and other non-health professionals were incapable 
of determining the care they needed. Consumer preferences were regarded as 
unimportant and not to receive weight in health decisions. Against this back-
ground, there were bans on advertising by health professionals and other profes-
sionals, such as lawyers. It was unprofessional to discuss fees. Competition among 
hospitals such as occurs in other sectors was viewed as unseemly. 
 In the era in which many say that the medical arms race ruled in the United 
States, the general conclusion was that competition increased quality. Yet under 
the new regime, as hospitals compete for contracts in a competitive market, might 
there be a tendency for hospitals to cut quality, especially noncontractible quality? 
Several studies of US markets have addressed this issue. 
 A well-cited study using data on persons hospitalized for heart attacks from 
the US Medicare program by  Kessler and McClellan (2000) , entitled  “ Is Hospital 
Competition Socially Wasteful?, ” focused on the effect of hospital competition on 
quality of care using mortality following hospitalization as the outcome measure 
of quality. The authors ’ measure of hospital competition was the HHI in the hos-
pital ’ s market area. The HHI is likely to be endogenous to a hospital ’ s quality since 
its market share, which is part of the calculation of the HHI, is likely to depend 
on the hospital ’ s quality level. Hospitals with poor quality should attract fewer 
patients, holding other factors constant. 
 Kessler and McClellan accounted for endogeneity of the HHI by estimating 
equations to predict each patient ’ s choice of hospital based on the distance from 
place of residence to alternative hospitals in the market as an important explana-
tory variable.  11 Given the emergency nature of a heart attack, people will consider 
relative distances a major factor in choice of hospital. It seems unlikely that a 
person would base the choice of housing location on the quality of nearby hospi-
tals, especially if the person does not have a chronic condition that may lead to a 
hospital admission on an emergency basis. If the latter assumption is acceptable, 
Kessler and McClellan ’ s technique allows examining the concentration of hospital 
output without considering that some hospitals may offer better cardiac care and 
attract patients for this reason. 
 Kessler and McClellan ’ s key finding was that before 1991 in the United States, 
increased competition among hospitals in a market reduced quality despite the 
medical arms race, but after 1991, increased competition in a market area increased 
quality. They attributed the change to the changed Medicare payment policy imple-
mented in 1980s and to the growth of HMOs during 1990s. Although much of the 
11.   These studies re -
quire a measure of 
competition among 
hospitals and the usual 
measure of choice is the 
HHI. The use of the HHI 
has been subject to 
several critiques. One is 
theoreti cal. The ideal 
measure would gauge 
the elasticity of the 
individual hospital ’ s 
demand curve. The HHI 
is not such a measure. 
This is a somewhat 
subtle point and thus 
merits some discussion 
here. The elasticity of 
demand measured in 
chapter 3 using data 
from the RAND Health 
Insurance Experiment 
and other data sources 
is an industry demand 
curve. The industry 
de mand curve is the 
(ver tical) sum of 
demand curves of 
individual consumers in 
a market. By contrast, 
the relevant demand 
curve for an analysis of 
competition among 
sellers in a market is the 
individual seller ’ s 
demand curve, in this 
context, the individual 
hospital ’ s demand 
curve. It is quite 
possible that the 
industry demand curve 
is quite inelastic, that 
is, the quantity 
demanded is quite 
unresponsive to price, 
and the individual 
seller ’ s demand curve 
is virtually flat 
(horizontal). With a flat 
demand curve, if the 
seller raises its price a 
tiny bit above the 
market-clearing price, 
the seller stands to lose 
all sales. For example, 
the demand for gasoline 
is much less elastic 
than is the demand 
curve for an individual 
gas station. The same

growth in HMO enrollment involved persons not enrolled in Medicare but 
rather in other health insurance plans, they argued there was a spillover from the 
private insurance market to Medicare. If higher quality were offered to privately 
insured patients, as a practical matter, it would be offered to Medicare beneficiaries 
as well. 
 Gowrisankaran and Town (2003)  used data on hospitalized patients with all 
different types of payment sources in Los Angeles, California. The patients were 
admitted either for pneumonia or for a heart attack. In this study, increased com-
petition for Medicare patients decreased quality, but increased competition for 
privately insured patients who were enrolled in HMOs increased quality. The 
results for Medicare contradict the findings of  Kessler and McClellan (2000) . One 
reason why increased competition could lower quality is that the price paid by the 
insurer is less than the marginal cost that the hospital incurs in treating patients. 
But as  Gaynor (2006 , 38) notes, the treatment of heart attacks is thought to be highly 
profitable, even when the payment source is Medicare. 
 The results of the Gowrisankaran and Town study point to the danger of 
generalizing from a single study. The question of whether or not increased competi-
tion leads to higher or lower quality is still unsettled empirically. And whether it 
does or does not is likely to depend on particulars, such as whether the hospital 
possesses market power to set prices for its services or the price is set high exter-
nally, such as by an insurer-purchaser, relative to the marginal cost to the hospital 
of providing the service. 
 6.6 
 Summary and Conclusions 
 One distinguishing feature of hospitals is that the vast majority are organized as 
not-for-profit enterprises. This chapter has explored possible reasons for the pre-
dominance of not-for-profit hospitals and has described economic models relevant 
to not-for-profit hospitals ’ behavior. Still another possibility that we did not explore 
is that not-for-profit hospitals maximize profits and use these profits to subsidize 
unprofitable activities. 
 Relationships between physicians and hospitals differ among countries. In 
this chapter, we have emphasized US hospitals, where hospitals and medical staffs 
are most often organized as separate entities, although hospitals have appropriately 
been called  “ the doctor ’ s workshop. ” In many other countries, physicians either 
practice in hospital settings or as ambulatory care physicians. When a person is 
hospitalized, the person obtains care from a physician other than the one the person 
sees on an ambulatory basis. The separation of hospital-based from ambulatory care 
physicians virtually eliminates the possibility of the cartel-like arrangement in the 
Pauly-Redisch model of the physicians ’ cooperative or in a physician-hospital 
organization. 
presumably goes for 
hospitals. In the case of 
hospitals, the high 
elasticity of demand 
faced by the individual 
hospital is not because 
pa tients tend to choose 
hospitals based on 
small differences in 
price. Rather, it is the 
insurers that cover the 
patients that do this. 
And under selective 
contracting, insurers 
can channel patients to 
hospitals in their 
networks. Another 
problem with the HHI is 
that there is, as noted 
above, substantial 
evidence that quality of 
care increases with the 
number of procedures 
that a hospital 
performs. The HHI 
considers market 
shares, not levels of 
output.

Hospitals 
 265
 Competition among hospitals is generally on a non-price basis to the extent 
that it exists at all. In the United States, price competition among hospitals is 
growing and replacing the regulatory approaches that were implemented as 
solutions to high rates of hospital cost inflation in the 1960s and 1970s. 
 In theory, price competition has attractive features. Whether or not societies 
are better off with a competitive hospital sector remains to be seen. Price competi-
tion among hospitals appears to have been successful in controlling the growth of 
hospital costs. However, empirical evidence on the quality of care under conditions 
of price competition is mixed. 
 Quality measure and quality assurance are both complex issues in the health 
care field. The next chapter analyses issues of quality of care in both hospital and 
ambulatory care.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 6.1  
 Who are decision makers in hospitals? Do the hospital ’ s decision makers differ 
in the Newhouse model and the Pauly-Redisch model? If so, explain how they 
differ. 
 6.2  
 Suppose a for-profit hospital makes its decisions by adopting the rule of profit 
maximizing and another not-for-profit hospital follows the decision rule 
described by the Newhouse model. Which hospital is likely to be more effi-
cient? How can hospital efficiency be measured? 

266 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 6.3 
 What is meant by the term  “ physicians ’ cooperative ” ? Give three examples 
of cooperatives in markets other than for physicians ’ services and explain the 
motivation for forming such cooperatives. 
 6.4 
 In the Pauly-Redisch model, physicians on the medical staff are the residual 
claimants. 
 a.  What is meant by the term  “ residual claimant ” — in general and in this context? 
 b.  What is meant by closed versus open staffing of hospitals? Describe the circum-
stances under which staffing is closed and open, using a graph. 
 c.  In what sense might closed staffing be a good thing from the standpoint of 
doctors? From the standpoint of consumer welfare? In what sense might closed 
staffing be disadvantageous to consumers? 
 6.5 
 Describe at least three arguments in the economic literature to justify the fact 
that not-for-profit hospitals, both private and public, tend to be more numer-
ous than for-profit hospitals in many health care systems around the world. 
 6.6 
 What is the theoretical relationship between hospital ownership and hospital 
performance? Do private not-for-profit hospitals enjoy any advantage that 
might increase their measured efficiency relative to that of for-profit hospi-
tals? What do the Newhouse and the physicians ’ cooperative models imply 
about the efficiency of private not-for-profit hospitals relative to that of for-
profit hospitals? 
 6.7 
 Overall, what does the empirical evidence show about the relative perfor-
mance of for-profit and private not-for-profit hospitals? 
 6.8 
 What is meant by the expression  “ medical arms race ” ? What are precondi-
tions for such a race to occur? What are the consequences of hospital competi-
tion induced by a medical arms race? 
 6.9 
 Explain the distinction between retrospective cost-based reimbursement and a 
prospective payment system (PPS), such as the one operated by the Medicare 
program in the United States. Why do health care payers generally prefer PPS 
to cost-based reimbursement but providers often prefer cost-based reimburse-
ment to PPS? 
 Exercises 
 6.1  Hospitals are thought to be subject to economies and diseconomies of scale 
and scope. What is meant by economies/diseconomies of scale and scope? What 
are sources of scale economies/diseconomies and scope economies/diseconomies 

Hospitals 
 267
in hospital settings? List and discuss up to three each for scale and scope 
economies. 
 6.2   Assume the hospital is a monopolist with a demand function given by  p = 
404  – 2 x , where  p is price of hospital care and  x is the quantity of hospital care, 
and a cost function given by  C = 300 + 4 x + 8 x 2 , where  C is total cost. Compute 
marginal cost and average cost. In addition, calculate the hospital ’ s profit-
maximizing output, price, revenue, and profit. 
 6.3   Now assume that the hospital is a monopolist with a demand function that 
incorporates quality of care as well as quantity. Quality enters into both the demand 
and cost functions according to  p = 100  – 3 x + 4 √ y and  C = 4 x 2  + 10 x +  y , where 
 p is the price of hospital care,  x is the quantity of hospital care,  y is the quality of 
hospital care, and  C is total cost. Compute the hospital ’ s profit-maximizing output, 
quality, price, revenue, and profit. 
 6.4   Suppose that a hospital has a production function of the type Ln x =  γ +  α ln S 
+  β ln B , where  x is the quantity of output,  S is the level of hospital services (e.g., 
radiographs, laboratory tests, patient physical therapy sessions), and  B is number 
of hospital beds;  γ ,  α , and  β are parameters. The hospital buys  S at price  p S and  B 
at price  p B . 
 a.  Compute the hospital ’ s marginal product and its average product. 
 b.  If regulators force the hospital to decrease the amount of  B by 10 percent, what 
must the hospital do to maintain quantity  x ? 
 c.  If the hospital maintains quantity  x , what will be the effect of the regulation on 
total hospital expenditures? Explain your answer. 
 6.5   As described in the chapter, in Newhouse ’ s model, the hospital maximizes 
utility, which depends on levels of quantity and quality of care, subject to a 
break-even constraint (price equals average cost). Use this model to analyze 
the effects of the following exogenous changes in the hospital ’ s production possi-
bility curve — that is, the hospital quantity-quality frontier (as shown in   fig. 6.3 ) —
 and the hospital ’ s optimal choices of quantity and quality of care (as shown in 
 fig. 6.4 ). 
 a.  an increase in the wage rate paid to the hospital ’ s employees; 
 b.  an increase in the number of persons with health insurance coverage in the 
hospital ’ s market area; 
 c.  implementation of a fixed dollar subsidy per unit of hospital care by the city 
government. 

268 
 Part II / Chapter 6
 6.6  Based on the Pauly-Redisch model, analyze the effects of the following exog-
enous changes on the optimal number of physicians on a hospital ’ s medical staff 
(as shown in   fig. 6.6 ). 
 a.  an increase in the wage rate of the hospital ’ s employees; 
 b.  an increase in the number of persons with health insurance coverage in the 
hospital ’ s market area; 
 c.  implementation of a fixed dollar subsidy per unit of hospital care by the city 
government. 
 6.7  In some settings, physicians are employed on a fixed salary basis by the hos-
pital. In others, physicians function as independent entrepreneurs and bill for care 
they deliver to hospitalized patients separately from the hospital ’ s bill for its ser-
vices. Describe three differences that you would expect to arise under these distinct 
employment/compensation arrangements for physicians. 
 6.8  Suppose there are two hospitals in town, Adam Hospital and Brown Hospital. 
Both hospitals face similar demand and cost functions. Thus, using the terminology 
of the Newhouse model, both hospitals have a similar production possibility curve. 
However, utility functions differ between these two hospitals. The boss of Adam 
Hospital focuses on increasing access to health care in the community and hence 
places a higher value on providing a high quantity of hospital care. By contrast, 
the boss of Brown Hospital focuses on increasing the quality of health care in the 
community and hence places a higher value on adopting the new medical 
technology. 
 a.  Show graphically how these two hospitals make choices of optimal quantity 
and quality (given their different objective functions). Which hospital is more 
likely to become a large hospital (in terms of hospital beds)? Explain your 
answer. 
 b.  Assume that the local government imposes an entry restriction to limit expan-
sion of hospital beds in the community. Specifically, the government requires 
a certificate of need if a hospital adds more than 100 new beds. Which hospital 
is more likely to be affected by such entry regulation, and why is this so? 
 c.  Assume that the local government adopts a regulation to restrict adoption of 
new medical technology. Specifically, the government prohibits small hospitals 
(e.g., those hospitals with 250 beds or fewer) from adopting new and expensive 
medical technology. Which hospital is more likely to be affected by this entry 
regulation? Explain your answer. 
 6.9  Assume there is only one hospital in a small town. This hospital faces a 
demand function given by  p = 304  – 2 x , where  p is the price of hospital care and 

Hospitals 
 269
 x is the quantity of hospital care, and a cost function given by  C = 500 + 4 x + 8 x 2 , 
where  C is total cost. 
 a.  Suppose the local government imposes price regulation on hospitals that freezes 
the price of hospital care at 250. Show the effects of this price ceiling on the 
hospital ’ s quantity of care and its revenue and profit. Be sure to indicate what 
the values of quantity, revenue, and profit would be in the absence of such 
regulation. 
 b.  If the local government were to further lower the maximum price that the hos-
pital can charge to patients to 240, compute the effect of this new price ceiling 
on the hospital ’ s quantity of care and its revenue and profit, compared to the 
older, higher price ceiling. Will this hospital remain in the market or will it exit? 
Explain your answer. 
 6.10   Suppose Town A and Town B each have four hospitals. The following table 
gives the bed size and output of each hospital. 
 Town A 
 Town A 
 Town B 
 Town B

 Based on the above information, what is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) 
for each town? Which market (Town A or Town B) is more concentrated? Does your 
answer depend on how you measure hospital market shares?

 Quality of Care and Medical 
Malpractice 
 At first glance, it must seem unusual that a health economics textbook would 
devote considerable attention to quality of care. A popular but inaccurate view of 
economics is that the discipline deals only with cost and money. Accordingly, it 
would be legitimate to think that health economics deals with health care cost 
containment and the cost-effectiveness of specific health care technologies. After 
all, as explained in chapter 14, cost-effectiveness is a ratio of cost to some health 
outcome resulting from the use of the health care technology. Yet as we have seen 
in previous chapters, health care quality issues keep coming up. Since quality 
reflects the use of scarce resources and people are willing to pay varying extra 
amounts more for it, quality is very much an economic issue. 
 This chapter focuses on health care quality — how it is measured, the levels 
of quality that are currently delivered, how well the market works in delivering 
socially optimal levels of quality (and what economists mean by  “ socially optimal 
quality ” ), public policies that are appropriate when markets fail to deliver socially 
optimal quality levels, and the pluses and minuses of public policies designed to 
promote quality. There are some minuses!

 Quality differs in markets for almost an endless list of goods and services. Some 
individuals are willing to pay more for a higher-quality good or service; such higher 
quality is supplied if the additional amount consumers are willing to pay for such 
extra quality is equal to or greater than the marginal cost of providing the extra

 Part II / Chapter 7
quality. Higher quality may reflect a combination of better materials being used to 
manufacture a product, more investment in design to achieve a more attractive 
product, and more resources being devoted to identifying product defects before 
the product is sold. In addition, higher quality includes a greater redundancy of 
inputs in the production process, which allows the firm to accommodate stochastic 
variation in demand for its product, greater product variety, more consumer assis-
tance in production selection at the point of sale, faster delivery, and more lenient 
product exchange and return policies. 
 Governments do not regulate the quality of T-shirts or picture frames. Presum-
ably the quality of the T-shirts and picture frames that markets provide is adequate 
to satisfy consumer wants. If it is not, presumably other T-shirt and picture frame 
suppliers will take their places in the marketplace. Externalities are not generally 
an important feature of either T-shirts or picture frames. While onlookers may 
become upset by the language or image on a T-shirt, the adverse reaction most 
directly adversely affects the wearer of the T-shirt. Further, we can safely assume 
that consumers are good at judging the types of products they want. If people want 
T-shirts with elaborate designs and in loud colors, the market will presumably 
provide such products. 
 A key rationale for government intervention in regulating quality is asym-
metric information between buyers and sellers of the product. But public regulation 
may be warranted even when information is not asymmetric. Even when full infor-
mation is available to consumers, some argue that consumers and sellers make bad 
decisions and thus require the benefit of public regulation to constrain or channel 
choices (see  Breyer 1982 ). For example, consumers may borrow more money than 
is prudent, and banks may be too willing to lend to such consumers. These prac-
tices may lead to defaults, which, when widespread, can have an adverse effect on 
the economy overall. This type of externality has provided a rationale for govern-
ment intervention in credit markets. 
 Individuals do not always have full information for making decisions. For 
one, markets may fail when parties to a transaction provide misleading or false 
information to others or fail to mention facts that these other parties may regard 
as pertinent to making a specific choice. Consumers of medical care may not be 
well positioned to evaluate the characteristics of alternative products, and they 
certainly are not as well positioned as the seller of the product, which reflects 
asymmetric information. For such goods, an element of trust on the part of the 
purchaser is required. Such goods are called  credence goods . 
 At least some types of medical care, such as emergency room visits, complex 
surgery, and hospital stays for some conditions, logically fall in the category of 
credence goods.  1 Since consumption of credence goods is inherently based on trust, 
it seems unlikely that we would observe advertisements for B-quality hospital care 
in the way that we observe advertisements for low-priced hotel rooms. Hospitals

chapter 5 for a

goods.

might claim that their care is of the highest quality, but they would be reluctant to 
assert that their care is A quality, and their competitor across the street offers 
B-quality care. These claims are sometimes made in direct-to-consumer advertise-
ments of pharmaceutical products ( Berndt and Donohue 2008 ), but only two coun-
tries allow such advertisements, the United States and New Zealand. 
 The localized nature of hospital and physicians ’ services has limited the 
amount of rating of quality by national organizations. The same applies to other 
services as well. For example,  Consumer Reports  rates the quality of cell phone 
service in some large US cities, but service in the vast majority of locations is not 
rated. Hotel chains that are national or international receive quality ratings, but the 
presumption is that the quality of these facilities does not vary meaningfully in 
different geographic locations. 
 The quality of goods is often rated. One can obtain data comparing fuel con-
sumption, speed, agility, and other characteristics of automobiles under controlled 
conditions. Frequency-of-repair records of various motor vehicles are not subject 
to controlled conditions. Different automobiles are often driven differently. Mini-
vans seem unlikely to be run in drag races as some sports cars often are, or, if drag 
races are unseemly, minivans are unlikely to be seen racing around mountain 
curves as in television advertisements for some sports cars. Yet owners of sports 
cars may be more cautious about having regular oil changes than minivan owners 
are. These types of comparisons are likely to be more useful within a category of 
motor vehicle rather than across categories. 
 Because quality comparisons are commonplace, automobile manufacturers 
must consider the marginal cost versus marginal return of increased investments 
in quality lest they market their products at uncompetitive prices and lose 
market share. The Big Three automobile producers in the United States have 
learned this lesson the hard way by losing substantial market share. This has driven 
them to substantially improve the quality of their products in recent years. For 
automobiles, market forces provide a strong incentive for manufacturers to make 
cost-quality trade-offs. Cars with favorable frequency-of-repair records command 
much higher prices as both new and used cars than do cars with unfavorable 
records. 
 In the health care sector, quality varies, but the relationship between product 
quality and price appears to be much weaker than that for many goods and services. 
The localized nature of these markets is only one reason for the difference. Other 
reasons include the large number of low-volume providers — some inefficiently 
small, the complexity of the products, and the important role of professional norms. 
Reliance on such norms means that patients are to trust their physicians and physi-
cians are to be worthy of such trust and are not to exploit such trust for their own 
personal gain. Frequency-of-repair records of motor vehicles have their counterpart 
in rates of adverse health outcomes that result from the receipt of medical care. 

278 
 Part II / Chapter 7
Injuries that occur as a result of receipt of medical care are called  iatrogenic inju-
ries . While we are often willing to overlook differences in consumer behavior, such 
as fast driving or poor maintenance, when comparing frequency of automobile 
repair, health care providers rightly warn that comparisons of rates of adverse 
health outcomes arising from the receipt of medical care may be misleading because 
patients differ in severity of illness in ways that are difficult to measure. Thus, for 
example, if patient outcomes are compared to gauge hospital quality, some hospi-
tals accept relatively sick patients for treatment, and if the comparisons fail to 
account for these differences, the reported differences in patient outcomes will 
yield misleading inferences about quality differences. In such cases, quality differ-
ences are likely to be overstated. A hospital with a high rate of adverse outcomes 
may actually be better than one with fewer such outcomes. 
 Hospitals fearing that a high adverse outcome rate may adversely reflect their 
reputation consequently may seek to admit patients for care who will make them 
look good, and severely ill patients may be denied access. Car dealers, in contrast 
to doctors and hospitals, would not be likely to query potential customers about 
their driving records and habits. If they did, they would almost certainly lose 
market share to car dealers that did not make such inquiries. In contrast to hospi-
tals, few would blame a car dealer with a service department if its customers had 
a high rate of accidents (unless the accidents could be directly attributed to a failure 
of the car dealer to take precautions, such as to check whether or not the bolts on 
the wheels were tightened after a tire rotation). Few would blame the dealer even 
if the new cars it sold had an unfavorable repair record. But hospitals stand to be 
blamed for poor outcomes, if the outcomes become widely known. Few journalists 
are likely to adjust the rates of adverse hospital outcomes for differences in the 
hospital ’ s patient case mix. 
 However, if patients (or even their doctors, when making a patient referral to 
another doctor) are unable to judge the quality of care of particular hospitals and 
doctors, these health care providers have little to gain financially from reducing 
rates of adverse outcomes. Even though there are nonfinancial reasons for providers 
to be concerned about quality (e.g., ethics, professional norms), the financial incen-
tive to improve quality seems to be less than it should be, although admittedly, 
quality is difficult to measure in the context of health care. 
 Health care executives often seem to view various investments in quality as 
costly and unprofitable, which is consistent with the view that adequate financial 
incentives for quality promotion are lacking at present. Also, many hospitals are 
still operated as free-standing independent organizations, and physicians ’ practices 
are generally much smaller than hospitals. Thus, the high fixed cost of investments 
in quality, such as investments in computerizing patient records, can be an impor-
tant impediment to undertaking such investments. In the absence of adequate 
market incentives, the role of ensuring quality falls to public regulation and civil 
litigation.

 Characteristics of Health Care Quality 
 How Economists View Quality 
 In most markets, firms produce heterogeneous goods with various attributes, and 
quality is one of the important attributes that distinguish one good from the other. 
If markets function well, goods with different quality levels would be sold at dif-
ferent prices. Since producing a high-quality good is relatively costly to firms, firms 
charge a higher price for a high-quality good. Thus, for most goods, high quality 
means a high cost or a high price. Quality then is a one-dimensional concept and 
can be simply measured by  “ money, ” either by cost or price. This is the concept 
employed in many economic literatures, including the Newhouse hospital model 
described in chapter 6. 
 In the context of health care, however, quality is a multi-dimensional concept 
that incorporates the ability, effort, and time that physicians spend in making a 
diagnosis and providing treatment, as well as various attributes of the delivery of 
health services, such as attentiveness, care, and diligence. Some types of quality 
are contractible, among them the number of meals patients receive daily while 
hospitalized, the size of hospital rooms, and the presence of a nurse at a nursing 
station 24 hours a day. However, other elements of quality are  “ noncontractible, ” 
such as the quality with which radiographs are interpreted or the probability that 
a physician washes his or her hands after examining a patient ( McGuire 2000 ). 
Noncontractible quality means that the aspect cannot be used as a basis for payment 
because it is difficult to incorporate time, attentiveness, care, or diligence in a 
payment system. Noncontractible quality is of value to the consumer, but the con-
sumer is not well positioned to measure it. Since such quality, like contractible 
quality, is costly to produce and the consumer cannot really know whether it is 
provided or not, there is a temptation not to provide it, particularly because added 
payment for added resource use may not be forthcoming. 
 When markets do not provide socially optimal levels of quality, other 
mechanisms can arise to compensate for this form of market failure. Globally, 
at least four approaches have been used to improve the quality of health care 
(t able 7.1 ). 
 The first approach relies on professional norms, which involve self-regulation 
by professionals. The second approach relies on government to implement various 
form of regulation to ensure quality. The third approach is to rely on competitive 
forces to achieve socially optimal quality, or at least to move in this direction. 
Various policies may be needed to push competitive forces in the right direction. 
The final approach involves the use of tort law, which creates the threat of a lawsuit 
initiated by injured patients to provide an incentive for physicians to eschew low-
quality (suboptimal level) of care. Later sections of this chapter analyze each of 
these four mechanisms in detail.  

280 
 Part II / Chapter 7
 How the Quality of Personal Health Care Services Is Measured 
 The quality of health care services can be measured by structure, process, or 
outcome ( Donabedian 1985 ). Measures of  structure describe input use, for example, 
the number of full-time-equivalent nurses per hospital bed, or whether or not the 
hospital offers particular types of services, such as cardiac surgery, the availability 
of drugs at a facility, and descriptors of infrastructure ( Mariko 2003 ). Measures of 
staffing may reflect employee absences (  box 7.1 ).  
 Process  refers to how care is delivered. For example, how long does it take 
after a person arrives at a hospital emergency department complaining of chest 
pain to be examined by a physician? When patients are discharged from the hos-
pital, with what frequency are they given prescriptions for medications appropriate 
to their conditions? In what percentage of cases are persons in high-risk groups 
vaccinated for illnesses that could cause them substantial harm? Are the appropri-
ate diagnostic tests ordered, given the patient ’ s signs and symptoms (  box 7.2 )?

 Staffing Net of Absences: A Structural Measure of Quality of Care 
 One major problem plaguing many low-income countries, but not unique to them, is 
health worker absenteeism.  Chaudhury, Hammer, Kremer, et al. (2006)  reviewed 
empirical evidence on absenteeism from several countries: Bangladesh, India, Indo-
nesia, Peru, and Uganda. On average, 35 percent of health workers were absent when 
observed by the researchers in these countries. Absenteeism rates varied from 25 
percent in Peru to 40 percent in India and Indonesia. Physicians were relatively more 
likely to be absent than were other health workers, probably because they were 
working in private practice during the hours the public clinics were open. Absentee-
ism was higher in lower-income countries than in those with relatively high incomes. 
In a study using data from rural Tanzania ( Klemick, Leonard, and Masatu 2009 ), 
persons were less likely to select clinics for care if the facility had relatively high 
rates of absenteeism, but this result was not statistically significant at conventional 
levels. 

Quality of Care and Medical Malpractice 
 281
Some databases track this type of detail on process quality. This allows researchers 
to uncover the extent to which the care for each patient aligns with medically 
appropriate measures and to use this information to evaluate hospitals according 
to the care they provide.  
 There is some evidence that process-of-care measures are related to other 
quality measures, such as a hospital ’ s general reputation. For example,  Chen, 
Radford, Wang, et al. (1999)  reported that hospitals rated as the best in the United 
States by  U.S. News and World Report ’ s influential list of  “ America ’ s Best Hospi-
tals ” performed better than average on most process measures in treating patients 
hospitalized for heart attacks. But even these outstanding hospitals were not 
perfect, providing a prescription for beta-blockers, a drug recommended for all 
persons who have experienced a heart attack, to only 75.0 percent of such patients 
at the time of discharge from the hospital. 
 Outcome  measures gauge effects of care. For example, among persons hospi-
talized for heart attacks, what percentage of persons admitted to a specific hospital 
with a primary diagnosis of a heart attack are alive a year following hospital admis-
sion (  box 7.3 )? What percentage of patients develop a hospital-acquired infection 
(e.g., pneumonia) during a stay at the hospital? How frequent are adverse health 
outcomes due to prescribing the wrong medication? How often is there a surgical 
 Box 7.2 
 Measures of Process Quality of Care 
 Das, Hammer, and Leonard (2008)  documented the quality of medical advice in low-
income countries, primarily from studies conducted in Tanzania, India, Indonesia, 
and Peru. Measures of quality of advice are process measures in that they describe 
how care is delivered using measures that are hypothesized to be systematically 
related to the quality of care. They measured process quality in two ways, through 
medical vignettes and direct observation of the doctor-patient interaction. A medical 
vignette describes a clinical scenario. Symptoms are first described to a physician. 
Physicians are then asked about the follow-up questions they would ask and the 
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures they would perform. Physicians who ask the 
appropriate questions and mention the appropriate procedures are judged to be more 
competent. The other approach is direct observation of what physicians actually do 
with actual patients, without or with surveys of patients about the physician-patient 
interaction as the patients leave the clinic. 
 The study reached quite pessimistic conclusions. Quality of care was observed to 
be quite low in low-income countries. Low competence of physicians was com-
pounded by low effort. Physicians were more knowledgeable than was evident from 
the care they actually provided. The poor were placed at a particular disadvantage 
because of poor quality of medical advice.  Leonard, Masatu, and Vialou (2007 ) 
describe the process of quality analysis in one country, Tanzania, in greater detail.

procedure on the wrong body part because, e.g., of a misinterpreted X-ray? What 
is the mean improvement in physical functioning following knee replacement 
surgery?  
 At first glance, it would always seem preferable to use outcome measures to 
gauge an organization ’ s quality. And in an ideal world, such measures would be 
preferable. Patients value good outcomes, which are reflected in higher patient 
utility. If patients and their physicians possess accurate measures of outcomes and 
if they are valid and reliable indicators of quality, there would be less reason to 
know much about structure and process. 
 But outcome measures also have limitations. First, outcomes data are often 
unavailable, and other types of measures of quality are used for this reason. Second, 
adverse outcomes occur for reasons other than poor medical care. There is substan-
tial heterogeneity in patients ’ conditions on admission to a hospital or at the time 
of a visit to a doctor ’ s office. For example, some patients have advanced cancer. 
Others have cancer in a very early stage. In comparing outcomes among providers, 
it is important to adjust for these differences. Such  “ risk adjustments, ” although 
feasible, can be quite complex in their own right. 
 Third, outcomes measured at a subsequent point in time may be truly attrib-
utable to other factors. For example, the mortality rate one year following admis-
sion to a hospital for a heart attack reflects not only the quality of care provided 
 Box 7.3 
 Outcomes-Based Measures of Quality of Care 
 Bj ö rkman and Svensson (2009 ) describe a randomized field experiment that entailed 
community-based monitoring of public primary health providers in Uganda. The 
experiment was based on the presumption that the quality of care in low-income 
countries, such as Uganda, is poor because monitoring of health care providers tends 
to be lacking. The rationale for the monitoring intervention was that although indi-
vidual patients can perceive problems with quality of care, they generally do not have 
knowledge about outcomes for the clinic or community as a whole. For this reason, 
and because monitoring a public facility is a public good (other patients benefit from 
an individual patient ’ s monitoring effort), there will suboptimal levels of monitoring 
if monitoring is not organized at the community level. 
 In this experiment, local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) helped organize 
grassroots efforts at the community level that provided monitoring of clinic services. 
Communities with and without this intervention were selected at random. 
 The study used various process indicators of quality, but in addition, outcome-
based measures of quality of care were included in the evaluation of effects of the 
intervention. In particular, the authors documented a statistically significant reduc-
tion in low-birth-weight infants and a 33 percent reduction in under-age-five mortal-
ity in the treatment communities.  

Quality of Care and Medical Malpractice

by the hospital and the patient ’ s condition at admission but also important inter-
vening events that may have occurred after the patient was discharged from the 
hospital. 
 Fourth, outcome measures have a random component. Some adverse events 
occur for reasons that cannot be anticipated in advance. For example, a patient 
may have an adverse reaction to a drug for reasons that are unknown to physicians, 
irrespective of how competent they are. 
 For these reasons, outcome measures are inherently noisy. The task for the 
researcher or quality-of-care evaluator is to extract the quality signal out of the 
noise. 
 It is conceptually possible but impractical to measure  every  relevant aspect 
of quality. For example, whether or not a physician routinely reports test findings 
to patients is a measure of process quality, but there are many such measures that 
could be monitored. 
 7.3 
 Adverse Events and Negligent Injuries 
 The Issues 
 If quality is higher than the level at which marginal social cost equals marginal 
social benefit, quality is too high. However, recent publicity about the frequency 
of iatrogenic injuries (those caused by an action or inaction during the course of 
diagnosis or treatment) suggests the opposite. Care is not of the quality level it 
should be. 
 The causes of the observed rates of iatrogenic injury are not entirely clear. 
But the message is,  “ getting medical care may be harmful to your health. ” Although 
the estimates are US-specific, it seems unlikely that the United States is unique 
among countries in this regard. A study conducted in New Zealand used a similar 
research methodology ( Bismark, Brennan, Paterson, et al. 2006 ) and reached similar 
conclusions as the prestigious Institute of Medicine ( IOM 2000 ) did in a well-
publicized US report,  To Err Is Human . The IOM concluded that 98,000 deaths 
occur in US hospitals annually as a result of avoidable, medical errors — more 
deaths than from motor vehicle accidents, AIDS, and breast cancer. 
 How the Estimates of Adverse Outcomes Were Generated 
 Since the mid-1970s, three major studies of the epidemiology of medical injuries 
among patients hospitalized in the United States have been conducted (  table 7.2 , 
see section 7.8).  2 These studies involved assembling information on process of care 
and health outcomes from patients ’ medical records. Once the data were assem-
bled, medical experts made judgments about whether the adverse outcomes could 
have been prevented if care recommended by expert panels had been followed. 
2.  These studies were 
conducted in the US 
states of California, 
New York, Colorado, 
and Utah.

284 
 Part II / Chapter 7
 For each medical record, physician reviewers who participated in the epide-
miologic assessments of medical errors graded the confidence that an adverse event 
occurred on a scale from 0 to 6 ( Brennan, Leape, Laird, et al. 1991 ). If the confidence 
level exceeded 1, a judgment was made whether or not there was negligence. Then, 
raters also noted the confidence level in this judgment. There were two physician 
reviewers for each record, and the physicians conducted their reviews indepen-
dently. When there was disagreement between the reviewers, this was noted by a 
medical records analyst and resolved by an independent review by a supervisory 
physician. 
 The Quality of the Estimates 
 To Err Is Human,  which summarized the results of the previous studies, received 
substantial publicity in the United States, and to a lesser extent throughout the 
world. On the one hand, one can argue that the number of iatrogenic injuries is 
high, even if the report ’ s point estimates are wrong. However, the estimates of 
deaths per annum resulting from hospitals ’ medical errors are indeed less precise 
than the IOM ’ s message implied. For one, medical accidents, unlike motor vehicle 
and workplace accidents, are not discrete events. Many persons enter the hospital 
in a frail condition and hence are particularly vulnerable to medical errors. But 
even if the error had not occurred, many persons admitted to a hospital do not 
have a long life expectancy. For this reason, life years lost would be a much more 
precise characterization of the harm attributable to errors. 
 Negative outcomes do occur, and with an appropriate level of informed 
consent; patients know or should know about these before agreeing to undergo or 
to forgo a procedure. To determine whether or not an error has occurred, it is nec-
essary to parse the adverse event into a part that reflects an error (and hence sub-
standard care) and a part that represents an unfortunate mishap but at the same 
time an appropriate level of care. 
 Another methodological issue is inter-rater variability in assessments of 
quality. Quality assessment, especially at the level of a overall judgment as to 
whether or not the quality of care given to a particular patient was adequate or not, 
is not totally objective but rather is subject to individual interpretation. Despite 
safeguards undertaken by the study investigators, including training of medical 
records reviewers, what is poor quality to one reviewer may be seen as adequate 
quality by another. There are just too many permutations and combinations of situ-
ations for any training process to result in fully consistent measurements of quality. 
 Concluding that these medical assessments are a  “ gold standard ” of quality 
measurement would be to give them too much credit. Nevertheless, the epidemio-
logic studies of medical injury were pathbreaking, particularly at the time they 
were conducted. Furthermore, the studies required substantial resources and 
patience to conduct at the high standard at which these studies were conducted. 

Quality of Care and Medical Malpractice 
 285
 In many cases, the underlying quality-of-care issue is not that complex, 
however. The most common adverse event in one of the three studies was adverse 
reactions to drugs (19 percent), followed by wound infections (14 percent). Docu-
menting adverse reactions to drugs or wound infections should not require appre-
ciable technical and specialized skills, but whether or not the care that preceded 
the adverse outcome was truly substandard often involves a greater amount of 
subjectivity. 
 Identifying other alleged errors is likely to require more specialized expertise. 
The reviewers identified errors in management in 58 percent of the adverse events, 
with nearly half of these attributed to negligence. Failure to diagnose was also 
common, as were adverse events in the emergency room ( Leape, Brennan, Laird, 
et al. 1991 ). 
 Reviewers examined medical records from one hospital admission that indi-
vidual persons had. With this limited amount of information, the reviewers could 
not have known about outcomes that became evident months or even years after 
the hospitalization evaluated in the study occurred. At the time of discharge from 
the hospital, there may have been no adverse outcomes. Many major injuries, such 
as birth injuries, are latent for years, and the fact that an injury had occurred 
becomes evident only gradually. Of course, this would lead to an underestimate of 
the amount of iatrogenic injury. 
 Do Observed Rates of Medical Errors and Adverse Outcomes 
Represent a Market Failure Justifying Government or Other 
Intervention? 
 Despite some technical limitations of these studies, they made an important con-
tribution in demonstrating that iatrogenic injury is an important public health 
issue. Whether or not observed rates of medical errors and adverse outcomes rep-
resent a market failure, thus justifying some form of external intervention, is a 
complex issue. At one level, the solution would seem to be improved information 
with the appropriate amount of risk adjustment for variation in patient severity of 
illness. If potential consumers were to become knowledgeable of relatively high 
error rates in advance of being admitted for treatment, some would argue that this 
would be a sufficient safeguard. If so, the next question is why such consumers 
have not been adequately informed to date. 
 The reason may be as simple as that information is a public good. Individual 
consumers are not well positioned to gather the requisite data for themselves and 
make the appropriate risk adjustments.  Consumer Reports , for example, publishes 
comparisons of quality of quite a number of goods and services.  Consumer Reports 
derives most of its revenue from subscription and store sales of the magazine, 
although it does accept donations. Car magazines provide detailed comparisons of 
automobile quality, often head-to-head comparisons of cars in the same category. 

286 
 Part II / Chapter 7
The publishers of car magazines are for-profit businesses that derive their revenue 
from magazine sales and advertisements. 
 In the case of health care, one would expect that private organizations would 
arise to provide such information, possibly with private or public subsidies. The 
high cost of assembling this information may cause market failure and provide a 
rationale for government involvement in a market-perfecting activity. What makes 
this type of information provision costly is that especially for some important but 
rare outcomes, to achieve statistical reliability it may be necessary to assemble large 
amounts of data, in addition to the necessity of risk adjustment. This is in contrast 
to automobiles, for which monitoring gas mileage and braking may require testing 
only one vehicle. 
 7.4 
 Supply-Side Quality-of-Care Safeguards and 
Government Oversight and Regulation 
 Overview 
 Historically, there has been widespread skepticism, including among health profes-
sionals, that consumers are sufficiently well equipped to adequately gauge quality 
of care. The underlying assumption until late in the twentieth century was that 
health care providers know about and can adequately assess quality. Or the pre-
sumption was that all doctors and hospitals are good. 
 Prior to the regulation of pharmaceuticals, there were many accounts of sales-
people marketing cures for all types of ailments to an unsuspecting public. Before 
the twentieth century, becoming a physician did not take much formal education. 
In the United States, proprietary medical schools often provided medical educa-
tion. To the extent that there are medical errors today, they undoubtedly pale in 
comparison to the rates of errors in the nineteenth century and earlier. However, 
except for anecdotal accounts of individual cases in which errors occurred, errors 
were not measured. 
 Professional Norms 
 The policy  “ cure ” for bad quality of medical care decades ago was not to rely on 
the judgments of consumers but to regulate the supply side through a combination 
of professional norms, self-regulation by medical professionals, and government 
regulation.  “ Professional norms ” specify how a professional is supposed to act, as 
reflected, for example, in the Hippocratic oath, written in 400 B.C. 
 Professional norms are enforced first and foremost by the professional him- or 
herself. But other members of the profession are asked to look over their shoulders 
for unprofessional behavior of their peers. If professional norms have been deemed 
to have been seriously violated, a health professional may be subject to formal 

Quality of Care and Medical Malpractice 
 287
sanctions. In less extreme cases, however, enforcement involves informal sanc-
tions. In recent times, medical school admissions committees assess applicants ’ 
reasons for wanting to become physicians and the likelihood that they will comply 
with professional norms. 
 Peer Review 
 The main rationale stated for medical staff organization of hospitals is to safeguard 
the quality of the hospital ’ s care (see chapter 6). Medical staffs do this by reviewing 
credentials, other qualifications, and experience prior to admitting a physician to 
the medical staff. Subsequently, once the physician is admitted to the medical staff, 
the organization is responsible for overseeing the quality of care provided by the 
physician at the hospital. Peer review in ambulatory settings often occurs 
informally. 
 One rationale for hospital peer review by medical staff, although a compara-
tively recent one, is that some internal mechanism for quality monitoring is needed 
if hospitals are really to compete with each other. But there are risks to such peer 
review. In particular, medical staff peer reviewers are likely to be competitors of 
the individual physicians they review. Banning a physician in part or in full may 
allow peer reviewers to improve their own competitive position ( Blumstein and 
Sloan 1988 ). Physicians denied hospital privileges have often sought legal remedies 
on the grounds that the medical staff ’ s decision was modified by a desire to reduce 
competition. Also, to what extent peer reviewers systematically modified monitor 
medical errors is unknown. The Pauly-Redisch model (see chapter 6) suggests that 
medical staff operate the hospital in their own collective financial interest, which 
is clearly a reason for hospital medical staff organization in addition to quality 
assurance. The model does not prove that the cartelization process it describes 
actually exists. To know this, one would need to conduct empirical analysis in a 
number of hospital settings, which has not been done to date. 
 Licensure 
 The oldest quality safeguard is licensure by governments. However, licensure is at 
best a weak safeguard of quality. Unless a physician moves to another jurisdiction, 
licensure is a once-and-for-all process, although many jurisdictions impose con-
tinuing medical education requirements as a condition for continued licensure. 
Unlike driver ’ s licenses, which require periodic reexaminations, physicians are 
typically licensed for life. Hospitals and other medical facilities are also licensed 
by governments, but less is known about how such licensure actually works in 
practice. 
 Economists have long been suspicious of the professional licensure process. 
In health care, providers have for too long insisted to the public that  “ we are 
all good. ” While there may be an interest in quality assurance, professionals 
have a financial incentive to limit supply (see, e.g.,  Friedman and Kuznets 1945 ). 

288 
 Part II / Chapter 7
Delicensure is rare and done in response to very major lapses and major miscon-
duct. In one US state, Florida, even physicians with very high and persistent 
medical malpractice rates were investigated by the licensing board only very rarely 
( Sloan, Mergenhagen, Burfield, et al. 1989 ). State licensure boards in the United 
States have changed, largely in response to political pressures that they serve the 
public interest ( Ameringer 1999 ). 
 Certification 
 Certification differs from licensure in that the certifying body indicates only that 
the medical professional or facility has satisfied certain requirements and, unlike 
licensure, imposes no absolute barrier to entry. Rather, consumers are to observe 
whether or not the provider is credentialed and by whom in making his or her 
purchasing decision. Given that there is no absolute barrier to entry, the anticom-
petitive effects of certification seem less than for licensure (see, e.g.,  Friedman 
1962 ). Moreover, certification, if done properly, may even be pro-competitive in 
informing consumers about providers ’ qualifications. In the United States, physi-
cians may be certified through twenty-four different specialty boards. Not all of 
these boards require recertification, and those that do typically require it only every 
7 to 10 years, which may be too infrequent in specialties subject to rapid techno-
logical change. 
 7.5 
 Mandatory Error Reporting 
 Description 
 To a far greater extent than the purely supply-side quality assurance mechanisms, 
in particular reliance on professional norms, peer review by medical staffs of 
hospitals, and licensure laws, mandatory error reporting requires suppliers to 
provide information to a public authority on their adverse outcome or error rates, 
which is published and used by consumers in making decisions about choice of 
provider. 
 Mandatory reporting of adverse outcomes is frequently proposed as a patient 
safety initiative. The reports of adverse outcomes can be used by government regu-
latory agencies to identify where errors are occurring ( Marchev, Rosenthal, and 
Booth 2003 ). If reporting systems provide timely and complete information to regu-
lators, this should, at least in principle, improve the agencies ’ role as monitors. 
 From 1986 to 1992, the US Medicare program reported risk-adjusted hospital 
mortality rates  3 for Medicare beneficiaries admitted to hospitals. One study found 
that hospitals for which there was an adverse report did not experience much 
change in demand ( Mennemeyer, Morrisey, and Howard 1997 ). Although the 
results were statistically significant at conventional levels, when the reported mor-
3.  See chapter 6 for 
a discussion of risk 
adjustment.

Quality of Care and Medical Malpractice

tality rate doubled, the patient volume at the hospital decreased by only one patient 
per week. 
 We can speculate as to the reasons for the small demand response. One reason 
may be that consumers do not value these differences in quality, but this explana-
tion seems implausible. Another is that the elderly are not well positioned to make 
detailed comparisons among hospitals. Some elderly persons are frail and suffer 
from cognitive limitations. On the other hand, elderly persons are likely to know 
many other persons, including friends and relatives, who are admitted to hospitals, 
and hospital issues are frequently discussed. However, at the other extreme, the 
elderly may be quite knowledgeable and aware of the deficiencies of such report 
cards — that some variations among hospitals reflect random noise, severity of 
patient illness at admission that has been inadequately accounted for, and there 
may be appreciable within-hospital quality differences. This extreme position is 
probably not correct either. In any case, facing political pressure, for a time, Medi-
care dropped its report cards. Some state governments in the United States began 
publishing them subsequently. 
 Peterson, DeLong, Jollis, et al. (1998) , who analyzed the New York experience 
with providing information on patient outcomes, found that the rate of cardiac 
surgery in New York increased following the introduction of report cards; fewer 
New York residents underwent bypass surgery out-of-state. Taken at face value, 
this result suggests that patients value this form of quality monitoring. 
 Dranove, Kessler, McClellan, et al. (2003 ), who analyzed the experience of 
cardiac surgery report cards in New York and Pennsylvania, reported that patients 
who before surgery had attributes associated with a higher probability of surviving 
the surgical procedure were more likely to be selected for treatment following 
publication of the report cards. They attributed such favorable selection for treat-
ment to public disclosure of hospital-specific mortality rates — just as the critics of 
public disclosure had feared. 
 Dranove and coauthors compared effects pre – and post – mandatory reporting 
and used as a control group for the same time periods neighboring states that did 
not implement mandatory reporting. This is called a  “ difference-in-difference ” 
approach. One difference is post versus pre in the treatment group (New York and 
Pennsylvania hospitals) and the other is the difference for the same two periods 
in the control group (hospitals in the neighboring states). Use of the control group 
allowed the authors to account for  other changes that occurred during the time 
period during which report cards were implemented but that were not related to 
report cards. For example, technological progress common to all of the states may 
have resulted in changes in the types of patients getting treatment and their health 
outcomes. Dranove and coauthors found that, following the implementation of 
report cards, persons undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery had incurred $300 
less in health expenditures  before  they received surgery than did persons in the 
control states. The lower expenditures suggest that the persons in the post – report 

290 
 Part II / Chapter 7
card implementation group in New York and Pennsylvania were relatively healthy 
at the time they were admitted to the hospital. Also, mean expenditure prior to 
surgery did not change in the same time interval as it did in the control states. 
 This evidence suggests that report cards led New York and Pennsylvania 
hospitals to select disproportionate numbers of persons who would be likely to 
survive their heart attacks and surgery in the post – report card period. Thus, access 
of the relatively sick to such services may have deteriorated — a form of  “ gaming ” 
to report cards that may not be in the public interest. We should not view such 
gaming as entirely bad since hospitals in the past may have been performing 
cardiac surgery on some persons who were at high risk and may have been better 
off with less aggressive therapy.  4 
 Jin and Leslie (2003 ) studied the effects of introducing hygiene quality grade 
cards in a non – health care setting — at restaurants in Los Angeles in 1998. The 
authors found that grade cards caused restaurant health inspection scores to 
increase, consumer demand to become sensitive to changes in restaurants ’ hygiene 
quality, and the number of food-borne illness hospitalizations to decrease. 
 Although the finding is interesting, there are important differences between 
hospitals and restaurants. Consumers are relatively well positioned to make 
informed choices among restaurants. Hygiene ratings are posted in a prominent 
place in the restaurant. Hence, a patron who is unsatisfied with the rating can walk 
out before being served. The frail and very elderly do not constitute such an impor-
tant share of the business of restaurants as they do of hospitals and nursing homes. 
And a favorable selection of restaurant patrons is not the issue it is for hospitals. 
In contrast to a cardiac surgeon, restaurants would have considerable difficulty in 
gauging the risk of patrons getting food-borne illnesses when they entered the 
restaurant. 
 Implications 
 Each quality assurance mechanism is deficient in some respect. None will do the 
job of ensuring patient safety by itself. More information is not necessarily better 
than less information if the data are not properly adjusted for patient case mix 
(severity). This can be done with methods that currently exist, but data assembly 
and adjustment can become very expensive. When the stakeholders — physicians 
and hospitals — do not like the results, one can expect vigorous political opposition 
to release of data on patient outcomes. 
 While the idea of providing information to consumers has its pitfalls, so does 
supply-side regulation of quality. The temptation is great for suppliers to pursue 
financial self-interest as well as or even instead of quality assurance. A knowledge-
able public is at least a partial safeguard. Without pressure from market forces, 
satisfying consumer wants for high-quality care seems unlikely. On the other hand, 
quality provision consumes resources. When patients are fully insured, the same 
type of welfare loss we have described for quantity (see chapters 3 and 4) can occur 
4.  Other findings from 
the  Dranove, Kessler, 
McClellan, et al. (2003 ) 
study also support the 
conclusion that report 
cards led to a smaller 
fraction of patients 
un dergoing cardiac 
surgery within a day of 
their admission to the 
hospital for a heart 
attack, implying that 
report cards might 
cause some hospitals to 
withhold immediate 
treatment be  cause of 
the risk of poor report 
card scores. Following 
the introduction of 
report cards, there was 
increased use of less 
expensive substitute 
technologies such as 
coronary angioplasties, 
again suggesting an 
increased use of bypass 
surgery among low-risk 
heart patients. Thus, 
the results obtained 
by Dranove and 
co-workers suggest that 
what changed following 
the introduction of 
report cards was the 
case mix of persons 
undergoing such 
surgery, not the quality 
of care provided to 
patients.

in the quality dimension. In the end, attainment of socially optimal levels of quality 
will require some out-of-pocket outlays by consumers, either in the form of higher 
health insurance premiums if persons want to have access to higher-quality (and 
more expensive) providers through the health plan ’ s network or cost sharing at the 
point of service. 
 7.6 
 Tort Law as a Mechanism for Improving 
Patient Safety and Health Care Quality 
 Why Other Quality Assurance Mechanisms May Fail 
 Medical malpractice is only one of several quality assurance mechanisms but the 
most controversial one by far. While medical malpractice has received the most 
publicity in the United States, it has become a public policy issue in high-income 
countries around the world, mainly because of the rise in medical malpractice 
insurance premiums (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
2007). 
 The trial bar, lawyers representing plaintiffs in medical malpractice cases, 
has argued, with considerable justification, that there would be no role for tort 
liability if the other quality assurance mechanisms functioned well. However, 
absent effective private mechanisms and government intervention, tort liability 
with contingency fees gives injury victims, irrespective of their financial status, a 
way to address grievances while simultaneously helping to prevent injuries for 
someone else. Based on the resolution of the legal dispute, a warning is issued 
about the consequences of failure to exercise due care. This is a contentious issue 
with lawyers for the defense. 
 Physicians ’ compensation is not based on the health outcomes of their patients 
(see chapter 5). However, lawyers paid on a contingency fee basis do receive out-
come-based compensation. If the plaintiff wins, they earn a percentage of the 
award. If, however, the case is resolved without the plaintiff receiving compensa-
tion, the lawyer receives nothing. 
 Before describing tort law in general and medical malpractice in particular, 
it is useful to consider why the other quality assurance mechanisms might fail to 
accomplish their stated purposed. There are several reasons. 
 First, public bureaucracies may be beholden to special interests or simply 
unresponsive, given the internal incentives of staff or understaffing. For one, some 
public employees may desire positions in regulated industries where pay is often 
higher than in government. Persons interested in being employed by firms they 
regulate may not want to be touch on a future employer. 
 More generally, the capture theory of public regulation implies that regulation 
is often used to protect existing sellers rather than to pursue the stated goals of 

292 
 Part II / Chapter 7
regulation ( Sage 2003 ). For example, medical licensure may be captured by those 
with licenses who rather than discipline those who repeatedly make medical errors 
use licensure to restrict entry. 
 Second, given the complexity of medical care, it is difficult for public agen-
cies or private credentialing organizations to oversee all aspects of care that may 
potentially affect quality. Third, imposing  and  enforcing minimum standards runs 
the risk of denying care to persons in areas in which care is generally inaccessible. 
Finally, individual health care providers lack an incentive to honestly disclose 
indicators of quality, in large part because their competitors may not be as truthful 
and so may gain a competitive advantage. This is an important rationale for public 
disclosure requirements. 
 A basic difference between tort law and the other quality assurance mecha-
nisms is that with tort law, the injury victim, not the government or a health care 
provider, initiates the action. The injury victim and patients more generally have 
a direct stake in ensuring that quality care is provided. However, as we shall see, 
medical malpractice, like the other quality assurance mechanisms, is far from 
perfect. 
 The ABCs of Tort Law 
 Tort Law Defined 
 In contrast to criminal law, which is enforced by government agencies, civil law 
relies on enforcement by private parties under rules promulgated by the public 
sector. One branch of civil law is tort law. A tort occurs when someone deliberately 
or through carelessness causes harm to another person or property. In common law, 
a tort is a civil or private wrong for which the law provides a remedy in the form 
of monetary payments and other remedies for the injured party or parties — the 
victims of wrongdoing. Under tort law, enforcement is performed by injury victims 
rather than by public officials, thus possibly overcoming the reluctance, or the lack 
of resources, of public officials to observe and act upon observed departures from 
regulatory rules. 
 By contrast, under criminal law, public officials prosecute parties accused of 
breaking the law. Criminal law is more effective than tort law when law breakers 
are likely to be  “ judgment proof, ” that is, unable to pay for the damage they caused. 
With few exceptions, criminal law is not applied in the context of injuries related 
to medical care (see   box 7.4  for exceptions).  
 Tort law applies to civil wrongs arising from extracontractual liability, that 
is, for wrongs other than those arising from a breach of contractual obligations. Tort 
law has several goals, among the most important of which are (1) to deter miscon-
duct and hence injury and (2) to compensate injury victims. There are also other 
objectives, such as meting out justice and providing a safety valve for airing 

Quality of Care and Medical Malpractice 
 293
victims ’ grievances. These latter objectives are important to maintaining a civil 
society. However, the deterrence is most directly pertinent for promoting the 
public ’ s health. 
 The Socially Optimal Injury Rate 
 An insight of economics is that optimal deterrence does not require that the injury 
rate be zero. Rather, the socially optimal rate of injuries would be zero only if the 
cost of averting injuries were zero. Conceptually, the goal of injury prevention is 
to minimize the total cost of injuries consisting of (1) the costs resulting from the 
injury and (2) the costs of averting it. Costs resulting from an injury include, but 
are not limited to, expenditures on medical care and rehabilitative services; the 
costs associated with reduced longevity; increased disability, pain, and suffering; 
and property losses. The costs of averting injuries range from investments in the 
goods or services themselves and in redundancy (backup systems to be used in the 
event of failure) to the time and effort involved in monitoring. 
 More specifically, let  e be a potential injurer ’ s expenditure on accident pre-
vention during a specific time period,  Θ ( e ) be the probability of an accident occur-
ring, like  e defined for a specific time period, and  D ( e ) be total loss incurred by 
the accident victim(s) should an accident occur. As a potential injurer (e.g., a 
 Box 7.4 
 Medical Malpractice Criminal Law 
 While in most countries, medical malpractice lawsuits are brought as civil actions, 
there are exceptions in which medical malpractice cases are prosecuted as criminal 
actions. In civil cases, the plaintiff is the private party who alleges an injury. By 
contrast, in criminal cases, rather than be brought by a plaintiff, who is typically 
represented by an attorney, the case is brought and pursued by a public prosecutor. 
This means that rather than seek representation by an attorney, an employee of the 
state must be convinced that the case is worth bringing. Another substantial difference 
between civil and criminal penalties is that the latter may include not only monetary 
penalties in the form of fines but incarceration as well. 
 In both Japan and Taiwan, physicians potentially face both civil and criminal 
liability in medical malpractice lawsuits ( Yang, Tsai, and Chiu 2009 ). In Taiwan, 
criminal lawsuits are the more common of the two. Injured patients and their families 
can seek legal counsel and file a civil lawsuit or can go to prosecutors to seek an 
indictment under criminal law. Most do the latter because it is both more convenient 
and less expensive. Prosecutors are obligated under Taiwan ’ s Criminal Code to inves-
tigate allegations brought to their attention. Convicted physicians face up to five years ’ 
imprisonment if convicted of a wrongful death charge. Cases involving physical 
injuries are considered to be lesser crimes and are subject to less severe penalties, 
including probation.  5

medical provider) spends more resources to avoid injury, the probability of an 
accident ( Θ ) and the total loss associated with the accident ( D ) decline. 
 Then the social objective is to find the  e that minimizes total social cost. 
 e +  Θ ( e ) D ( e ). 
(7.1) 
 In f  igure 7.1 ,  e is a 45-degree line from the origin since effort on accident 
prevention is measured by monetary expenditure, which is equal to the dollar value 
expressed on the vertical line. The expected loss  Θ ( e ) D ( e ) declines as  e increases, 
but at a decreasing rate of decline. The sum  e +  Θ ( e ) D ( e ) declines up to the point 
where the curve for the expected loss intersects with the 45-degree line and 
increases with further units of  e . For this reason,  e * is considered to be the socially 
optimal investment in prevention because the total social cost is the minimum at 
this point.  
 In other words, the total social cost of injuries is minimized by investing in 
injury prevention up to the point at which the marginal cost of injury prevention 
equals the marginal benefit of such investments, which is the value of reductions 
in injury cost ( Calabresi 1970 ). Investing an infinite amount in injury prevention 
would only be optimal if the costs resulting from the injury were infinite, which

is implausible. In addition, allocating infinite amounts to injury prevention would 
leave no resources to satisfy other wants. In promoting socially appropriate deter-
rence, the task of tort is to provide signals to private decision makers about how 
much they should invest in injury-prevention activities. 
 Now suppose potential injurers faced no potential loss from the injuries they 
might cause. Then from a private standpoint, and assuming that accidents cause 
no damage to oneself, the optimal level of  e would be zero. Potential injurers would 
allocate much less than the socially optimal amounts to injury prevention. 
 The Negligence Rule: Only One of Several Alternative Liability Rules 
 Under a rule of  strict liability , the injurer bears the loss if it is determined that the 
injurer  caused  the loss. Alternatively, under a  negligence liability rule, the injurer, 
not the injury victim, bears the loss if it can be determined that (1) a loss occurred, 
(2) the injurer in fact caused the loss, and (3) the loss occurred because of the 
injurer ’ s failure to exercise due care, where the ideal is that due care is set at the 
socially optimal level of care defined in the conceptual terms ( e *) above. The third 
step is key, but rather than specify a socially optimal level of care, courts use the 
concept of  “ standard of care. ” The standard of care has traditionally been defined 
as the care level prevailing in the area in which the injury occurred, but this defi-
nition is shifting at least in some places to a criterion of whether the defendant 
deviated from  “ reasonable ” conduct. 
 In sum, to prevail in a tort lawsuit under a negligence rule, the plaintiff must 
prove that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, the defendant 
breached this duty by failing to adhere to the standard of care expected, and this 
breach of duty caused an injury to the plaintiff. 
 Alternatively, returning to f  igure 7.1 , if the potential injurer faced a  strict 
liability rule, he or she would be responsible for any losses that the injurer causes. 
Under this rule, the potential injurer would select the optimal amount of care  e * 
since investment minimizes his or her expected loss. 
 Still another alternative is that potential injurers operate under a  negligence 
rule. Under these circumstances, there is an additional condition to causation for 
payment, namely, that the injurer did not adhere to a due care standard when the 
accident occurred. Then if the due care standard is set at  e * or higher, the injurer 
pays nothing. If, however,  e is less than  e *, the injury pays the accident victim ’ s 
loss. Thus, for  e equal to or greater than  e *, the injurer ’ s cost equals  e . For  e less 
than  e *, the injurer ’ s cost is  e +  Θ ( e ) D ( e ). The potential injurer ’ s cost is thus lowest 
at  e * (  fig. 7.2 ).  
 Under both negligence and strict liability rules, socially optimal amounts are 
allocated to prevention. There is likely to be more litigation under strict liability, 
however. The legal cost of proving both causation and failure to set injury precau-
tion at  e * or higher is likely to be higher under negligence because proving that 
the injurer failed to exercise due care can be very costly. 

296 
 Part II / Chapter 7
 The rationale for strict liability is that one party is better positioned to imple-
ment measures to avoid the injury. For example, the manufacturer of lawn mowers 
can prevent injuries by installing barriers between the blade and the lawn-mower 
users. This precaution is designed to prevent even a careless lawn-mower user from 
injuring him- or herself. Under a negligence rule, the defense could argue that the 
user was careless and this led to the accident, but determining whether or not the 
user had indeed been careless or as an amateur was just unaware may involve 
substantial litigation cost. 
 Contracts versus Torts 
 An alternative to imposing liability on health care providers would be to achieve 
injury prevention by contract. This is not feasible in some contexts. For example, 
it is not feasible for individual drivers of motor vehicles to contract with drivers 
they have never met to establish mechanisms specified in contracts for accident 
prevention. 
 Contracting might work as an alternative to medical liability, however. Indi-
viduals would purchase insurance from an enterprise, such as a managed care 
organization (MCO; see chapter 11). The enterprise would then contract with spe-
cific hospitals and physicians to supply care at a particular level of quality. To

ensure quality, these hospitals and physicians could implement specific patient 
safety programs agreed upon with the MCO in advance. The insurance contract 
could also provide a schedule of indemnity payments to compensate insured indi-
viduals if an iatrogenic injury occurred. 
 According to the Coase theorem ( Coase 1960 ), if all parties are fully informed 
about risk and if contracting is costless, then the allocation of resources to loss 
prevention, which is what exercising due care is about, will be the same, whether 
or not losses reside with the injury victim or with the injurer. Whether or not the 
injurer or the injury victim bears the loss, there is an incentive for potential injur-
ers to take safety precautions. 
 However, even if we accept Coase ’ s premise, if consumers in general or 
patients in particular misperceive risks, or if contracting is costly, then loss preven-
tion may be insufficient ( Spence 1977 ;  Shavell 1980 ). Indeed, the risks of adverse 
outcomes may be misperceived (i.e., perceived to be less than they really are) or 
consumers or their agents (e.g., MCOs) may not be well positioned to monitor the 
quality of care received. If so, absent some type of intervention in the market, such 
as imposing liability, fines, surcharges, or some other penalty on potential injurers, 
the rate of risky procedures will be too high, and the amount of care undertaken 
per procedure may be too low compared to the socially optimal level. 
 At first glance, it may seem obvious that consumers misperceive risks and 
are not well positioned to monitor quality. However, the issue is more complex 
than this, and in the end, the accuracy of risk perceptions and the extent of quality 
monitoring are empirical issues. Health care consumers may be knowledgeable 
about some risks, such as the risk of adverse outcomes in the case of routine preg-
nancies, but highly uninformed about care for a very rare condition ( Pauly 2001 ). 
Markets may often be adequate in conveying differences in quality, though perhaps 
not as frequently as one would like. But even when markets fail, there are quality 
assurance mechanisms in addition to tort. 
 If  no liability  is imposed, such as under a no-fault system (see chapter 10), 
each party to an accident bears his or her own loss. Potential injurers have nothing 
to lose in the event of an accident as injurers but they bear the full loss if they are 
injury victims. In the context of medical malpractice, patients, not providers, are 
the victims. But in other contexts, such as motor vehicle liability, each driver can 
be either an injurer or a victim. 
 Under no liability, potential injury victims invest in precaution up to the 
point at which the marginal cost of precaution equals the marginal benefit mea-
sured in terms of averted losses, which is at the socially optimal care level. Under 
the negligence rule, by contrast, the injurer compensates the victim only if he or 
she fails to exercise due care, which by assumption is set at the socially optimal 
precaution level. At the same time, potential injury victims expect that others 
(potential injurers) will exercise due care and thus not have to pay the victim in 
the event an accident occurs. Given this assumption, the optimal care level for 

298 
 Part II / Chapter 7
injury victims is at the due care standard. Under the negligence rule, accidents 
would occur (at the socially optimal level), but no one would ever be negligent. 
This theoretical prediction, of course, runs counter to the facts. 
 When the Negligence Rule Leads Private Parties to Select a 
Socially Optimal Precaution Level 
 The above theoretical results about effects of the negligence rule apply only under 
very restrictive assumptions. Among the most important assumptions are the fol-
lowing: (1) due care standards, when applicable, and damages are set appropri-
ately — the former to reflect the socially optimal care level and the latter as an 
accurate measure of losses incurred; and (2) claims for damages are filed whenever, 
but only when injuries are truly caused by an action or an inaction of an injurer 
under strict liability and whenever there is causation and the due care standard is 
breached under the negligence rule. 
 In reality, fewer than the appropriate number of medical malpractice claims 
are filed because of the transactions costs of obtaining payment for losses incurred. 
Moreover, insofar as under the negligence rule, it is necessary to demonstrate both 
causation and damages, one would expect to observe more claims under strict 
liability than under the negligence rule. 
 Tort Liability under Attack 
 Since about the 1970s, especially in the United States, tort liability in general, not 
just medical malpractice, has been under attack from critics, who cite the costly 
and capricious nature of tort liability and its impact in higher prices and decreased 
availability of those goods and services particularly likely to be involved in litiga-
tion. Criticisms have not been applied equally to all areas of tort. The least criticism 
has been directed toward routine personal injury torts, such as slip and fall cases 
and automobile accidents. In the middle are cases that are brought by individual 
plaintiffs, as opposed to class action suits. This category includes medical malprac-
tice suits. The third category, the most controversial one, includes mass torts cases 
in which many plaintiffs join together in suing a large entity such as a publicly 
held corporation (e.g., over silicone breast implants, cigarettes, or pharmaceutical 
products such as Vioxx). 
 Much of the criticism is emotionally charged, based on anecdotes, and often 
devoid of analytic content and replete with factual errors (see, e.g.,  Haltom and 
McCann 2004 ;  Baker 2005 ). Concerns are raised more frequently during times of 
rising insurance premiums, but the major concern among scholars of tort law is 
the actual performance of tort in attaining the above objectives. 
 However, critics, including scholars, have raised some fundamental issues, 
which merit careful scrutiny. There is now a large body of empirical evidence on 
the performance of tort liability as it has been applied in several contexts. Most 
pertinent to this book are concerns about deterrence. 

Quality of Care and Medical Malpractice 
 299
 Most important, as discussed more fully below, there is no evidence that the 
threat of tort deters medical injury, although such evidence exists for other applica-
tions of tort law, such as for dram shop liability and to a lesser extent for motor 
vehicle liability ( Sloan, Stout, Whetten-Goldstein, et al. 2000 ;  White 2004 ). 
 Why the threat of a civil lawsuit is effective under some circumstances and 
not under others is not entirely clear. One reason, not the only one, may be that 
the underlying technology of injury prevention is easier in some areas than in 
others. Having a bartender order a taxicab for a patron who has consumed too many 
beers is a simpler technology than preventing a mishap in transplanting an organ 
or even in preventing a mix-up in distributing medications in a hospital since so 
many hands are involved in this activity. 
 The above-stated rationale for tort assumes that the legal system is efficient 
and accurate in adjudicating claims. At some point, inefficiencies and inaccuracies 
would tip the balance against the use of tort liability. Inefficiencies and inaccura-
cies have been alleged by the critics of tort liability in general and of medical 
malpractice liability in particular, who point to the long time it takes to resolve 
tort claims, the substantial cost of claims resolution, and errors in determining 
liability and setting damages. Based on the statements of the critics, this hardly 
seems like an efficient and accurate system. However, advocates for tort view it as 
an effective private mechanism for meting out justice, especially when other 
systems, such as self-regulation by business and professional organizations and 
public regulation, fail to achieve their stated purposes. Defenders of tort liability 
further argue that individualized justice is expensive to achieve and hence is inher-
ently expensive.

 While most has been written about medical malpractice in the United States, it 
exists in countries throughout the world (OECD 2007). Many of the complaints 
about medical malpractice one hears in the United States are also heard in other 
countries. 
 Medical malpractice involves a number of parties, each with its own objec-
tives and constraints. For analytic purposes, we consider four distinct but inter-
related markets. The first market is for medical care, where consumers are patients 
and physicians are suppliers of care. Second, there is the legal market, where both 
injury victims and physicians as defendants demand legal services, supplied by 
lawyers and the courts. Third is the market for medical malpractice insurance. In 
this market, the consumers are physicians and other health professionals and the 
suppliers are medical malpractice insurers. Finally, there is the market for 

300 
 Part II / Chapter 7
government activity, in which the law-as-market view posits that legislation and 
government activity is a good demanded and supplied much like other goods. We 
describe the first two markets here. 
 Medical Care Market 
 Individuals may select physicians, a hospital, and other health care providers based 
on perceived quality, distance, and other factors. Conceptually, providers take 
account of downstream liability cost in setting their professional care standards. 
Ideally, providers could be sure they could escape liability by exercising the stan-
dard of due care set at the socially optimal care level. At least three impediments 
stand in the way. 
 First, courts are likely not to set the care standard at socially optimal levels 
or they may be inconsistent in the standards they set. Realistically, medical care 
is so multifaceted there is no way courts could set consistent standards for every 
medical situation, although setting consistent standards for situations that fre-
quently lead to lawsuits would be helpful. 
 Second, as explained below, the number of lawsuits against health care pro-
viders falls far short of the number of medical errors that are committed by these 
individuals and organizations. This is not unique to medical malpractice. Citations 
of drivers who exceed the speed limit are far rarer than the number of drivers who 
exceed such speed limits. Underclaiming or too few citations can lead to exces-
sively careless behavior. 
 Third, the vast majority of physicians have complete insurance for their 
medical malpractice losses ( Danzon 1985 ). Consequently, physicians do not bear 
a financial cost for the negligent injuries they cause. Nor, in contrast to motor 
vehicle liability insurance, are medical malpractice premiums experience-rated 
( Sloan 1990 ; OECD 2007). Although complete non-experience-rated insurance may 
be expected to blunt any deterrent effect that imposing medical liability might 
otherwise have, being sued does exact a price in terms of psychological distress 
and possibly loss of reputation as well. Furthermore, the time and earnings losses 
associated with being involved as a defendant in a lawsuit are not covered by 
medical malpractice insurance. 
 A distinction is often made between  “ positive ”  and  “ negative ”  defensive 
medicine in discussions of medical malpractice.  Positive defensive medicine  refers 
to increases in the cost of personal health care services attributable to the threat of 
being sued. Confronted with the threat of suits, physicians may order more tests, 
perform more surgical procedures, and undertake other medical interventions than 
they might in the absence of this type of threat. 
 Negative defensive medicine  applies to a physician ’ s withdrawal of care as a 
result of retirement, location change, or the dropping of procedures that often lead 
to lawsuits, such as those associated with obstetric care. That the threat of liability 
may affect the activity level that potentially exposes an agent to litigation is not 

Quality of Care and Medical Malpractice

unique to medical malpractice. For example, the cost of products liability may 
cause the manufacturer of a product to raise its price. Following the price increase, 
the quantity demanded falls, and eventually the manufacturer goes out of 
business. 
 For an economist, a test or procedure or other intervention becomes  “ defen-
sive ” when, in the view of an informed decision maker, ex ante, the marginal 
benefit is less than its marginal cost. Using this definition, to the extent that the 
threat of medical malpractice litigation increases the provision of care for which 
marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost, then such litigation serves its desired 
purpose, and conversely. 
 Several other definitions have been used in the field. For example, the  US 
Office of Technology Assessment, US Congress (1994,  13), defined defensive medi-
cine as the following way: 
 Defensive medicine occurs when doctors order tests, procedures, or visits, or avoid 
high-risk patients or procedures, primarily (but not necessarily solely) to reduce their 
exposure to malpractice liability. When physicians do extra tests or procedures primar-
ily to reduce malpractice liability, they are practicing positive defensive medicine. 
When they avoid certain patients or procedures, they are practicing negative defensive 
medicine. 
 The first definition, from the economics and law tradition, uses the concept 
of optimal care as the level of care that would maximize consumer well-
being, given available scarce resources. This optimal level of care calls on health 
professionals ’  assistance to serve as the patient ’ s agent to the extent that patients 
are not able to select optimal care on their own. The goal of tort liability is to 
encourage socially optimal choices. The US Office of Technology Assessment 
definition, based on a view shared by the vast majority of health professionals, 
begins with a very different premise. Medical liability has little or nothing to do 
with optimal care. Instead, the threat of being sued is an unnecessary disruption, 
and changes in resource allocation attributable to the threat are inherently 
wasteful. 
 Ideally, medical malpractice would lead to the provision of optimal levels of 
care. 6 But there may be under- or overdeterrence (the latter called  “ defensive medi-
cine ” ). If the threat of liability is excessive or imposed arbitrarily, overdeterrence 
could result. Overdeterrence occurs when quality is supplied at a level above the 
socially optimal level. For example, physicians may overprescribe diagnostic tests 
and therapeutic procedures. The threat of lawsuits may also cause physicians 
to avoid certain types of procedures and locations. Again, we cannot generalize 
that such responses are desirable or undesirable. If a physician is not competent 
in performing a procedure because, for example, he or she performs few of them, 
then the threat is a positive outcome. On the other hand, if the threat truly 
6.  See, for example, 
 Shavell (1980) .

drives competent physicians from care that is demanded, the threat may be counter-
productive. 
 Legal Market 
 In the legal market, individuals who have experienced iatrogenic injuries and who 
may have been passive in their role as patients become active participants as plain-
tiffs. In the vast majority of claims, as with other personal injuries, lawyers are 
paid on a contingency fee basis, which typically amounts to 33 – 40 percent of total 
compensation to plaintiffs ( Sloan, Githens, Clayton, et al. 1993 ). 
 In the event the plaintiff drops the case or the plaintiff loses at verdict, the 
plaintiff ’ s attorney receives no compensation. For this reason, attorneys have a 
strong incentive to accept only those cases that are likely to result in compensation 
greater than or equal to the legal cost they incur, including a return on their own 
time. Medical malpractice litigation can be quite complex in that technical details 
are often involved, at least relative to other legal disputes, as for example automo-
bile accidents, for which causation may be more easily determined and for which 
a police report exists. There is empirical evidence that attorneys specializing in 
medical malpractice litigation obtain higher levels of compensation for their clients 
( Sloan, Githens, Clayton, et al. 1993 ). 
 Critics of the legal market in the context of medical malpractice allege that 
(1) lawyers frequently encourage persons with adverse outcomes from the receipt 
of medical care and who have nonmeritorious claims to file lawsuits, (2) liability 
laws unduly favor plaintiffs, and (3) plaintiffs are overcompensated for their losses. 
There are concerns that jury decisions are unduly swayed by the severity and cir-
cumstances of the plaintiff  ’ s injury, but these criticisms are rebutted with empirical 
evidence from other studies (see, e.g.,  Vidmar 1998 ,  2004 ). 
 Researchers have conducted much empirical analysis on medical malprac-
tice, particularly in the United States.  7 The results of empirical analysis fail to find 
that injury victims are overcompensated for their losses when they sue for medical 
malpractice ( Sloan, Githens, Clayton, et al. 1993 ). Although plaintiffs in medical 
malpractice cases lose most often at trial ( Sieg 2000 ), this does not mean that 
medical cases as a group are frivolous, although perhaps some are. Rather, plaintiff 
attorneys sometimes go to trial rather than drop a case for strategic reasons. If 
plaintiffs ’ lawyers never went to trial, they would lose bargaining power in settle-
ment negotiations. The vast majority of medical malpractice lawsuits are either 
dropped or settled without much court involvement. 
 Viewed from a societal perspective, the primary role of the medical liability 
system must be quality assurance. When quality of care is high, the risk of iatro-
genic injury decreases. Thus, the failure to regulate quality and therefore deter 
injury is a major deficiency of medical malpractice as it exists today. We turn to 
empirical evidence on medical malpractice as an injury deterrent in the following 
section.

 Does the Threat of Medical Malpractice Suits 
Deter Iatrogenic Injuries? 
 One series of influential studies has documented the frequency of medical error 
rates in hospitals. Three major studies of the epidemiology of medical injuries 
among patients hospitalized in the United States have been conducted since the 
mid-1970s (  table 7.2 ). The earliest study was based on reviews of 20,864 patient 
records in California in 1974 ( Mills, Boyden, and Rubsamen 1977 ). Building on the 
methods of the California study, the Harvard Medical Practice study reviewed 
records of 31,429 patients hospitalized in the state of New York during 1984, and 
reviewed litigation records ( Weiler, Hiatt, Newhouse, et al. 1993 ). More recently, 
Colorado and Utah used the New York methodology in reviews of medical records 
of persons hospitalized in Colorado and Utah ( Thomas, Studdert, Burstein, et al. 
2000 ;  Mello and Brennan 2002 ). Rates of injury due to receipt or nonreceipt of 
medical care were highest in the California study and lowest in the studies con-
ducted 18 years later in Colorado and Utah (  table 7.2 ). However, the share of inju-
ries attributed to negligence was highest in Utah.  
 In the Harvard study, the best known of the three, two physician reviewers, 
working independently, rated their confidence that an adverse event attributable 
to the receipt or nonreceipt of medical care occurred, based on reviews of each 
medical record on a scale from 0 to 6 ( Brennan, Leape, Laird, et al. 1991 ). Similarly, 
the reviewers assessed negligence. When there was disagreement among the review-
ers, this was noted by a medical records analyst and resolved on independent 
review by a supervisory physician. This was an  “ implicit review, ” meaning that it 
was up to the physician to make an assessment of negligence without following 
explicit specialty-specific criteria. 
 The study reports there were 7.6 times as many negligent injuries as there 
were claims; only 2 percent of negligent adverse events resulted in medical

malpractice claims. Thus, only a small fraction of cases that could have resulted 
in medical malpractice lawsuits were in fact filed. But also troubling was the high 
frequency of  “ invalid ” claims, those not matching the study ’ s determination of 
liability from raters ’ evaluations of the medical records, which outnumbered valid 
claims by a ratio of three to one ( Studdert, Mello, and Brennan 2004 ). From these 
studies, it is evident that errors occur in both directions: not enough valid claims 
were filed and too many invalid claims were filed. 
 A recent study placed medical malpractice in the United States in a more 
favorable light.  Peters (2007)  synthesized the findings of a dozen empirical studies 
on the relationship between malpractice settlement rates and quality of care. He 
found that both the likelihood of a settlement payment and the amount paid in 
settlement were closely related to the quality of the underlying claim of medical 
malpractice. In fact, all studies except the Harvard study found a correlation 
between settlement rate and case quality. Peters found that the number of categories 
claims used in the study made a material difference. The studies that divided the 
claims into three categories, such as negligent, not negligent, and uncertain, showed 
a stronger link between negligence and settlement outcome than the studies using 
two categories, such as negligent or not negligent. In addition, Peters found that 
only 10 – 20 percent of claimants with low-odds of winning claims received a settle-
ment. This figure corresponds to a normal rate of disagreement when independent 
observers rate performance. 
 A second group of studies provides empirical evidence on medical malprac-
tice ’ s role in deterring iatrogenic injuries. Although medical malpractice, like tort 
liability more generally, has many goals, at the top of the list is injury deterrence. 
Whether or not the threat of tort liability actually deters is fundamentally an 
empirical question and cannot be decided based on theoretical arguments alone or 
on the basis of casual empirical observations. Overall, the quantitative evidence 
on this issue is conflicting and does not support the notion that the threat of 
medical malpractice litigation reduces medical errors or improves medical quality 
in general. 
 Empirical analysis of this issue has used two approaches. One approach is to 
examine providers within a government jurisdiction, more specifically a US state, 
and determine whether or not injury rates or practice patterns consistent with 
higher quality of care occur in areas within the jurisdiction in which the threat of 
medical malpractice lawsuits is higher. The other approach is to examine the effects 
of changes in tort law affecting the probability of being sued and examine whether 
or not these changes affect the rates of adverse outcomes. 
 The first approach was implemented in a study of adverse outcomes in the 
forty-nine New York hospitals conducted for the Harvard study described above 
( Weiler, Hiatt, Newhouse, et al. 1993 ). The threat of a malpractice claim was mea-
sured as the fraction of negligent injuries (as determined by the researchers ’ assess-
ments of medical records at the hospital) that actually resulted in a medical

malpractice claim. Dependent variables for the equation measuring the threat of 
lawsuits on outcomes were the fraction of hospitalizations that resulted in injuries, 
and the fraction of all injuries that were attributable to negligence. The authors 
failed to obtain statistically significant results, implying no effect of variations in 
the threat on outcomes at these forty-nine hospitals. 
 A research study using the second approach resulted in a highly cited paper 
on the topic of defensive medicine by  Kessler and McClellan (1996 ). Although the 
focus of the study is on defensive medicine, it is also useful as an outcomes study 
because tort reforms that reduced the threat of lawsuits should have increased the 
rates of adverse outcomes to the extent that tort liability was an injury deterrent. 
Empirical details are provided in   box 7.5 .  
 Box 7.5 
 Empirical Analysis of Defensive Medicine: The Kessler-McClellan Study 
 Kessler and McClellan (1996) used longitudinal data on all elderly (aged 65+) Medi-
care beneficiaries who were hospitalized for a new acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
or newly diagnosed ischemic heart disease (IHD) in 1984, 1987, and 1990. The key 
explanatory variables were tort law reforms implemented in the state in which the 
beneficiary was admitted for treatment. The authors assessed the effect of the statutory 
changes on total hospital Medicare payments during the year after the admission for 
the AMI or IHD to measure the effect of the statutory changes on intensity of treat-
ment. If the changes succeeded in reducing the extent of defensive medicine, one 
should see reductions in treatment intensity or cost attributable to these changes. 
Kessler and McClellan also studied the impact of the tort reforms on patient outcomes 
because if higher cost resulted in better health outcomes, this would not be considered 
to be defensive medicine. Rather, it would be seen as good care. 
 Using Kessler and McClellan ’ s methodology, defensive medicine is reduced if 
the reforms reduced treatment intensity but did not adversely affect patient out-
comes. Their outcomes measured mortality within one year of admission for the 
treatment for AMI or IHD and whether the patient experienced a subsequent AMI 
or heart failure, judged by admission for either condition in the year following 
the index event. Kessler and McClellan combined reforms into two variables: 
 “ direct ” and  “ indirect. ”  Direct reforms include caps on damage awards, the abolition 
of punitive damages, no mandatory prejudgment interest, and collateral source rule 
reform. 8 
 Punitive damages are obligations of the defendant to pay amounts over and above 
the amount needed to compensate the plaintiff for losses incurred. Incurred losses 
include pecuniary losses, such as for medical care and lost wages, and nonpecuniary 
loss, such as losses due to pain and suffering. The goal of punitive damages is to 
punish the defendant by more than the amount of loss needed to restore the plaintiff 
to his or her previous condition. Prejudgment interest refers to interest payments the 
defendant might otherwise be compelled to make on losses unpaid to the plaintiff 
8.  Punitive damages 
maybe awarded when 
the defendant ’ s action 
is found to have 
deliberatively harmed 
the patient or 
represented conduct 
not befitting a 
professional. A few 
states have abolished 
punitive damages in 
medical malpractice 
cases even though 
punitive damages are 
rarely paid in the 
context of medical 
malpractice. 
Prejudgment interest 
refers to interest 
payments on the loss 
between the date of 
injury or the date a 
lawsuit is filed and the 
date the verdict is 
reached. Limits on 
prejudgment interest 
have the effect of 
reducing such interest 
payments.

306 
 Part II / Chapter 7
 Kessler and McClellan concluded that liability reforms reduced defensive 
medicine practices, given their results showing that reforms reduced the cost of 
care while not adversely affecting outcomes. For those concerned with defensive 
medicine, the results are generally good news. However, if the issue of interest is 
the deterrent effect of tort liability, the lack of an effect of relaxing the threat of 
liability on health outcomes is not favorable news. 
 A follow-up study by  Sloan and Shadle (2009 ), which in addition to examin-
ing hospitalizations for heart disease examined the effects of the same tort reforms 
on the cost of hospitalizations for breast cancer, stroke, and diabetes, found no 
effect of the tort reforms Kessler and McClellan examined on Medicare payments 
from the time of the injury to the date on which the case is resolved, whether or not 
the defendant is found to be liable for the injury. 
 The general rule in countries that use the common law system, such as the US 
and the UK, is that the payments plaintiffs receive for a loss from their insurers are 
not deducted from the amounts they receive in a medical malpractice verdict. When 
the rule is modified, such amounts are deducted from the medical malpractice 
payment award. 
 Indirect reforms included other reforms that may affect pressures from tort on care 
provision but affect awards only indirectly, such as limitations on the plaintiff ’ s 
attorney ’ s contingency fees, which may make it more difficult for injury victims to 
file medical malpractice claims. Indirect reforms are limits on contingency fees, 
mandatory periodic payments, JSL reform, and the availability of a patient compensa-
tion fund. The study controls for the effects of other factors by including explanatory 
variables for state and year. 
 Under the contingency fee system, the lawyer for the plaintiff is paid only if he 
or she wins the case, and conditional on winning, the lawyer receives a certain pre-
determined share of the payment to the plaintiff, in the United States, generally 33 – 40 
percent. Some tort reforms place an upper limit on this percentage. 
 In general, payment is made to the plaintiff in a lump sum. Some critics of medical 
malpractice argue that the percentages going to plaintiffs ’ lawyers are too high. Caps 
on contingency fees represent such limits. Since the plaintiff ’ s attorney still incurs 
the cost of his or her side of the case, but with limits on contingency fees, the attorney 
may receive a lower payment. In this way, such limits reduce the incentive lawyers 
have to represent medical malpractice plaintiffs. 
 Kessler and McClellan found that in states adopting direct reforms, compared to 
states without reforms, Medicare payments for hospital care during the first year 
declined 5 – 9 percent. Similarly, in states with indirect reforms, Medicare payments 
declined 1.8 percent. Mortality was almost entirely unchanged in reform and nonre-
form states.

for hospitals, and with one exception found no effects of the reforms on health 
outcomes either. This lack of findings on hospitalizations for a broader range of 
diagnoses raises a question whether or not Kessler and McClellan ’ s findings, which 
were only for heart disease, generalize. However, the Sloan and Shadle results do 
support an important inference from the Kessler and McClellan study, namely, that 
relaxing the threat of lawsuits would not lead to worse health outcomes, as oppo-
nents of tort reform argue it would. 
 Several studies have assessed the effect of the threat of medical malpractice 
lawsuits on the probability that a cesarean section may be performed rather than 
a vaginal delivery. These studies are useful as birth injuries are a frequent allega-
tion in medical malpractice suits, more frequent than allegations of failure to 
perform a cardiac procedure ( Sloan, Githens, Clayton, et al. 1993 ). The results of 
these studies have been mixed. Using data from Florida,  Sloan, Entman, Reilly, 
et al. (1997)  reported that malpractice pressures had no effect on the method of 
obstetric delivery (cesarean versus vaginal delivery). However, an earlier study 
using data from New York State had found an effect ( Localio, Lawthers, Bengtson, 
et al. 1993 ).  Dubay, Kaestner, and Waidmann (1999)  used data from birth certifi-
cates from 1990 through 1992 to assess the impact of medical malpractice risk on 
cesarean rates and infant health. They found that a $10,000 reduction in malprac-
tice premiums could result in a 1.4 – 2.4 percent decline in the cesarean section rate 
for some mothers, except those of the highest socioeconomic status. The authors 
concluded that caps on total damages could reduce the number of cesarean sections 
by 3 percent and total obstetric charges by 0.27 percent. 
 More recently, studies by  Kim (2007) ,  Currie and McLeod (2008) , and  Yang, 
Mello, Subramanian, et al. (2009)  examined the impacts of tort reforms on the use 
and mix of obstetric services and on health outcomes. Kim used various measures 
of the risk of being sued and found that cesarean section rates and most other 
measures of physician behavior employed in the study (e.g., the use of forceps, 
vacuum extraction) were not affected by variation in the risk of being sued.  Currie 
and McLeod (2008)  found that reform of the joint and several liability (JSL) rule 
reduced complications of labor and procedure use, while caps on noneconomic 
damages increased them. JSL reform made it more difficult for a plaintiff to suc-
cessfully sue the physician ’ s hospital. To the extent that the hospital is a less 
dependable source of payment in the event of a payment for a claim resulting from 
care provided at the hospital, physicians have an added incentive to be careful. 
On the other hand, noneconomic damage caps reduce the amount that the physi-
cian can expect to pay in the event he or she loses a lawsuit. Thus, there is a 
reduction in the physician ’ s incentive to undertake precautions to avoid a medical 
mishap. Yang and coauthors (2009), using medical malpractice insurance premi-
ums and tort reforms as measures of the threat of liability, found that an increased 
threat of liability influenced the choice of delivery method (cesarean section versus 
vaginal delivery). However, the effect sizes are not large. 

308 
 Part II / Chapter 7
 When these studies are viewed as a group, it is difficult to find evidence of 
a consistent link between the threat of tort liability and a reduction in medical 
error rates. There is some evidence for positive defensive medicine. However, the 
case that positive defensive medicine is a  major factor driving up spending on 
personal health services, as is often alleged, is weak at best. 
 7.9 
 Summary and Conclusions 
 Much of health policy has focused on the quality of care. Many health care insti-
tutional arrangements reflect the motive to preserve and enhance quality. Histori-
cally, there has been a widespread suspicion that consumers of health care are not 
well positioned to judge the quality of care they receive, and this has led to sub-
stantial emphasis on supply-side approaches to quality assurance. Each perhaps 
has positive attributes, but each has its potential flaws as well. A general strategy 
of replacing demand-side with supply-side monitoring of quality is fraught with 
complexity and adverse side effects. In particular, it seems reasonable to expect 
that while most health professionals have an interest in providing a high quality 
of care, they are also likely to have other motives. Thus, professional norms and 
licensure, while well-intentioned, can be used to boost the profits of suppliers. 
Professional norms can reduce the flow of consumer information, thus conferring 
market power on individual sellers. Licensure can be used as a barrier to entry, 
conferring a de facto franchise on existing licensed professionals or at least using 
the licensure process to bar entry of those who follow undesirable commercial 
(read: competitive) approaches. Similarly, hospital peer review can be used both 
to improve the quality of hospital care and to bar the entry of physician competi-
tors to the hospital. 
 Medical malpractice has important flaws, which this chapter has documented. 
On the other hand, widespread opposition to medical malpractice stems in part 
from the fact that it empowers consumers to lodge complaints against providers. 
 Public policies that improve the flow of information to consumers, who in 
turn will be in a better position to make allocative choices, are promising. Even 
these policies, however, have some potential shortcomings, which we have identi-
fied. In particular, if providers are to be graded, they can improve their quality or 
they can select patients who because of their relatively light conditions help 
improve the providers ’ grades. This raises challenges for the information reports —
 how to classify patients according to their medical conditions prior to treatment 
and how to deal with small samples per provider, which decreases the reliability 
of the reports. Clearly, there are many situations in which insurers as purchasers 
of health care need to act in the interests of the persons they insure. In the end, 
demand-side quality assurance offers substantial promise. We have some way to 
go before this promise is fully realized, however.

to improving the quality of health care. Is more information necessarily better 
than no information? Why or why not? 
 Exercises 
 7.1  Suppose a physician receives a fixed payment ( ˆp ) for providing health care 
services to a patient and there is a probability of the patient incurring iatrogenic 
injury ( Θ ) that causes monetary loss to the patient ( ˆL ). Assume that the patient ’ s 
monetary loss is fixed once the injury has occurred. However, the probability of 
injury depends on the physician ’ s level of care ( e,  for effort). That is,  Θ =  Θ ( e ). 
The probability of injury decreases as the level of physician care increases (i.e., 
 Θ ( e )  < 0). In addition, the effort involved in increasing the level of care is costly 
to the physician in terms of time, stress, and nonphysician inputs the physician 
employs in his or her practice. Thus, the physician faces a cost function  C , which 
also depends on the level of care.  C =  C ( e ).  C ′ ( e )  > 0; cost increases with the level 
of care. Using this information, answer the following questions. 
 a.  Assume that the physician ’ s sole objective in practicing medicine is to maximize 
profit, list the physician ’ s objective (profit) function under the following liability 
regimes: (i) no liability, (ii) strict liability, and (iii) negligence liability. 
 b.  With the level of care ( e ) on the horizontal axis and the profit ($) on the vertical 
axis, show graphically how the physician determines the optimal level of care 
under each of the three alternative liability regimes. 
 c.  Use a graph similar to  figure 7.1 to show how to decide what the socially optimal 
level of care is. 
 d.   If the court has sufficient information to set the compensation ( ˆD ) equal to the 
injury victim ’ s monetary loss ( ˆL ), which liability rules can ensure that the phy-
sician ’ s optimal care level and the socially optimal care level coincide? Explain 
your answer. 

Quality of Care and Medical Malpractice

 e.  Using a graph, explain the distinction between strict liability and the negligence 
rule. Under what condition do we expect that these liability rules will achieve 
the same level of optimal care? 
 7.2   Suppose a patient who was injured because of a medical error (e.g., an adverse 
drug reaction) is thinking about whether or not to file a medical malpractice claim 
against his doctor. Suppose he is a  “ rational ” decision maker in the sense that he 
decides whether or not to file a claim based on his prediction of returns versus 
costs if he files. Let  Θ represent the probability of eventually receiving compensa-
tion if he files,  V  be the size of payment conditional on receiving any compensation, 
and  C be cost of filing and pursuing a claim. 
 a.  What is the expected value (payoff) of the claim to the injury victim at filing? 
 b.  Suppose patient A lives in a country where lawyers are paid on a contingency 
fee basis and patient B lives in another country where contingency fees are 
prohibited and lawyers are paid by the hour for their legal work. Suppose both 
the probability of receiving compensation and the size of payment conditional 
on receiving some payment are the same for patients A and B. Which person is 
more likely to file a medical malpractice claim? Explain your answer. ( Hint: Pay 
attention to incentives faced by both patients and their lawyers.) 
 c.  Suppose both patients C and D live in the United States, where lawyers are paid 
contingency fees, and the cases are comparable in the sense that the probabilities 
of receiving compensation are the same. However, patient C lives in a state 
where there is no cap on medical malpractice awards, while patient D lives in 
a state where there is a cap. Under these circumstances, which patient is more 
likely to file a medical malpractice claim? Why? 
 7.3   In recent years, many organizations around the world have published rank-
ings of both universities and hospitals. For example, the  U.S. News and World 
Report has regularly published  “ The Top 10 Best Universities in the US ” and  “ the 
Top 10 Best Hospitals in the US ” for many years. 
 a.  What are likely to be differences between the hospital ranking and the university 
ranking in terms of their information content? Which one is likely to provide 
more valid and reliable information for potential users? Why is this so? 
 b.  Would you expect there to be any difference between private and public agen-
cies in performing rankings of hospitals? Suppose both a private firm and a 
public agency were to publish a  “ 10 Best Hospitals ” list for the city where you 
live. Which organization ’ s ranking would be more valuable to probable hospital 
patients? Justify your answer. 
 c.  List the pros and cons of hospital rankings from the viewpoint of the 
consumer.

 Part II / Chapter 7
 d.   How would you expect hospitals to respond to published hospital rankings? Is 
there any evidence to support your argument? 
 7.4  Conduct a field survey in the community in which you live (either your own 
survey or by searching websites) on price variations between low- and high-quality 
goods for each of the following six products: (1) digital camera, (2) college or uni-
versity tuition, (3) physician fees for a routine outpatient visit, (4) charge for a 
hospital day, (5) a midday meal at a full-service restaurant, and (6) monthly rent 
for a three-bedroom apartment. Among these six products, for which is the correla-
tion between price and quality likely to be the highest? The lowest? Explain why 
correlations for some products should be strong and for others weak or even nearly 
zero. 
 7.5  In   table 7.1 , we list four incentive mechanisms (professional norms, regula-
tion, market competition, and tort law) for ensuring high levels of health care 
quality. 
 a.  Among these four mechanisms, which one seems to play a relatively more 
important role in your country? Explain your answer. 
 b.  Do the four mechanisms listed in   table 7.1  also ensure high quality levels for 
higher education (university)? Why or why not? 
 c.  Medical malpractice claims (i.e., patients suing their physicians and/or hospi-
tals) are fairly common in many countries. Is it common for students to sue their 
university professors for a suboptimal quality of teaching? Can you conceive of 
tort law being used as mechanism for ensuring a high quality of higher educa-
tion? Why or why not?

 Nurses in Hospital and Long-
Term Care Service 
 Health care is a major source of employment of labor at virtually all skill levels, 
with the skill mix differing substantially among countries. Some health care 
workers have relatively minimal amounts of training specific to health care. Others 
acquire skills on the job. Still others acquire formal education in health care, which 
is later supplemented with on-the-job training and experience. Dominant among 
the latter are professional nurses, both in numbers and in responsibility for provi-
sion of health care on an ongoing basis. This chapter focuses on professional 
nurses. 
 Nurses are the largest group of health care professionals. Nurses assume 
important roles in the provision of various personal health services, in particular 
hospital-based, nursing home, and home health care. We begin this chapter with 
an overview of labor markets for nurses worldwide. We then describe two concepts: 
(1) economic concepts of surplus and shortage, terms that mean something different 
from their common meanings when used by economists, and (2) the role of mon-
opsony power in markets for nurses. 
 We then discuss the role of nurses in the production of hospital and long-term 
care services. Professional nurses provide much if not most direct care in hospitals. 
Professional nurses also often serve in supervisory roles in long-term care 
settings. 
 One important health policy issue concerns the quality of care in hospitals 
and nursing homes. Quality of care and approaches for improving it are increas-
ingly important to policy makers, especially in high-income countries. In this

 8.1 
 Labor Markets for Nurses Worldwide 
 Nurse labor is one of the primary inputs in the production of personal health care 
services. The labor supply decisions of nurses have important effects on access, 
quality, and cost of the health care provided to patients. For example, when nurses 
are scarce relative to patients in a hospital, the quality of care may suffer because 
nurses can pay less attention to each individual patient and patients are more likely 
to have to wait for nurses to provide any care at all. Although the relationship 
between nurse staffing and quality of care is an intuitively plausible one, only 
recently have studies actually quantified the relationship empirically. 
 Nurses ’  compensation accounts for a large portion of hospital labor costs 
globally. Because of societal pressures to maintain and improve quality of care and 
simultaneous pressures on health care budgets, labor supply decisions of nurses 
have become a major policy concern for health care policy makers in many coun-
tries. Health care administrators have spent much time worrying about how to 
attract nurses to their organizations while at the same time preserving their orga-
nizations ’ financial strength. 
 Professional nurses are employed in private and public hospitals, long-term 
care institutions, clinics, and other health facilities; some nurses are self-employed. 
A common metric used in making geographic comparisons of the distribution of 
nurses is the number of nurses per 1,000 population, hereafter referred to as  nurse 
density . 
 There are substantial differences in nurse density across countries (  table 8.1 ). 
Based on data from 175 countries for years around the year 2000, the global mean 
of nurse density is 3.56, with a range from 0.11 to 15.20 per 1,000 population. In 
 table 8.1 , we further group the countries into four groups according to their gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita in constant 2000 US dollars. Nurse density 
increased with a country ’ s income level. In low-income countries, there were 1.03 
nurses per 1,000 population. This ratio was 7.03 in high-income countries.  
 Despite the positive relationship between income and nurse density, there 
was still substantial variation among countries with similar income levels. For 
example, nurse density ranged from 0.80 to 15.20 in high-income countries. Accord-
ing to another data source, which documents density for member countries of the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the number of 
nurses per 1,000 population ranged from 1.7 in Turkey and Korea to 14.8 in Ireland 
( table 8.2 ).  
 Several factors account for variation in the number of nurses relative to popu-
lation among countries. Three plausible factors are GDP per capita, per capita 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 321
expenditures on personal health care services, and physician density. On the first, 
the simple correlation between a country ’ s nurse density and its GDP per capita is 
0.71 (  table 8.3 ), confirming that nurse density increases with income. In addition, 
the parameter estimate from a regression of nurse density on GDP per capita yields 
an estimated elasticity of nurse density with respect to income of 0.53. This elastic-
ity estimate implies that, on average, a 10 percent increase in GDP per capita leads 
to a 5.3 percent increase in the country ’ s nurse density. A clear implication is that 
a reason for low nurse density in some countries is that the countries are at a low 
level of economic development.  
 Second, countries that spend more on personal health care services per 
person may well buy more  caring  (or subjective components of personal health 
care services, which are nevertheless important to people) but relatively little 
additional  curing (or physiological health).  1 Since nursing is a  “ caring ” profession, 
part of nurses ’ responsibility is to reduce pain and suffering and mitigate the 
inconveniences associated with the receipt of personal health care services, it is 
plausible to expect that countries spending more on health care would have a 
higher nurse density. Based on data from 175 countries, the simple correlation 
between nurse density and share of GDP allocated to personal health care services 
is 0.37, indicating that nurse density increases with a country ’ s commitment of 
resources to personal health care services (  table 8.3 ).

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 323
 Using a parameter estimate from a regression of nurse density on this share, 
the estimated elasticity of nurse density with respect to the share of GDP allocated 
to personal health care services is 1.17, indicating that a 10 percent increase in 
GDP share spent on health care leads to an 11.7 percent increase in nurse density. 
 However, the above relationship does not hold if the analysis is limited to 
high-income countries. An OECD study ( OECD 2004 ) reported no statistically sig-
nificant relationship between nurse density and health expenditures as a percent-
age of GDP. This lack of a relationship in this analysis may reflect a relatively small 
sample size as well as heterogeneity in nurse remuneration levels among high-
income countries. 
 Third, the correlation between nurse density and physician density is 0.72 
( table 8.3 ). The parameter estimate from a regression of nurse density on physician 
density yields an estimated elasticity of nurse density with respect to physician 
density of 0.62, indicating that a 10 percent increase in physician density leads to 
a 6.2 percent increase in nurse density on average. This suggests that specific health 
care technologies adopted in a country may be simultaneously physician- and 
nurse-using. 
 If variation in physician density alone accounted for most of the variation in 
nurse density among countries, then one would expect to observe small differences 
in the ratio of active nurses to active physicians among countries. However, in fact, 
there is appreciable intercountry variation in ratios of active nurses to physicians 
( table 8.2 ). Some countries, such as Ireland and Canada, employ about five nurses 
per physician, while other countries, such as Korea and Turkey, employ only about 
one nurse per physician. 
 Furthermore, international differences in nurse density may reflect differ-
ences in quality of health care that may not be readily measured at the country 
level. At the individual hospital level (discussed more fully below), several studies

have documented that patient outcomes are better when nurse staffing is higher. 
However, it may be inappropriate to infer that a relationship at the level of a hos-
pital or nursing home extends to a country as well. 
 Although countries differ in nurse density, there are many similarities in labor 
markets for nurses among countries, at least among high-income countries. First, 
the number of nurses per 1,000 population increased during 1990 – 2003 in most 
high-income countries except Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Poland (  table 
8.2 ). The mean annual growth of active nurses per 1,000 population ranged from 
0.7 percent in Iceland to 3.4 percent in Finland between 1990 and 2003. The 
increase in number of nurses probably reflects a strong growth in demand for per-
sonal health care services, resulting in part from technological advances and to 
some extent from population aging. However, just because nurse supply has grown 
does not necessarily mean that it has grown sufficiently. Whether or not the growth 
in the supply of nurses has kept up with the increase in demand for personal health 
care services is an important policy question to be examined in greater detail below. 
 Second, the labor market for nurses has several distinctive characteristics that 
apply to many high-income as well as lower-income countries. Among these, the 
most important is that nursing has predominantly been a female profession, over 
90 percent female in fifteen OECD countries. In South Korea, nearly 100 percent 
of nurses are women. 
 An important consequence of this extraordinarily high share of female nurses 
is that, at least until quite recently, most nurses have not been the primary earners 
in their households, and nonwage factors are likely to be important determinants 
of labor supply. Despite its importance to patients and to health care, nursing has 
long been perceived as a  “ vocation ”  rather than a  “ profession ”  in many societies 
( Heyes 2005 ). Furthermore, high proportions of registered nurses in many countries 
are dissatisfied with their jobs ( Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, et al. 2001 ). Among many 
job attributes,  Shields and Ward (2001)  found evidence that dissatisfaction with 
promotion and training opportunities has a stronger impact on intentions to quit 
nursing jobs than does workload or pay. Nursing is often very stressful with a very 
flat career path, relatively low earnings growth, and often limited opportunities for 
professional advancement ( Steinbrook 2002 ). 
 Third, there is a widespread perception of excess demand for nurses in 
several countries, although in a few countries the perception is one of excess 
supply. Excess demand for nurses is not a new phenomenon. Many countries, such 
as the United States and United Kingdom, have experienced recurring periods of 
excess demand for nurses since at least the end of World War II ( Shields 2004 ). 
Also, excess demand is not limited to countries with relatively low nurse density 
but exists in other countries as well, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, and 
Norway ( OECD 2004 ). 
 In common parlance, conditions of excess demand are termed  “ shortages ” 
and those of excess supply are termed  “ surpluses. ”  In economics, such shortages 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 325
and surpluses are temporary unless there is a restraint on wage changes, which 
keep the labor market from clearing, that is, reaching an equilibrium in which the 
quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. 
 However, the market-clearing process may be impeded by constantly shifting 
demand and supply curves. A situation of persistent excess demand may arise from 
a trend in which growth in the supply of nurses fails to match an increased demand 
for nurses. During the past four decades, many countries experienced a sustained 
growth in demand for personal health care services, which in turn increased the 
 derived demand for nursing services. 
 By contrast, several factors have restrained the growth in the supply of nurses. 
Women now have more career options than previously. For example, while medi-
cine once was dominated by males, many females now enter medical school, 
and a career in medicine competes with nursing. In other markets, such as the 
market for gasoline, price increases lead to market clearing. In markets for nurses, 
however, markets often seem to fail to clear, and if they do, it is only with a sub-
stantial lag. 
 Why markets for nursing do not seem to clear is an important public policy 
issue. Consumers are willing to pay for such care and would be better off if these 
wants were satisfied. 
 8.2 
 Supply of Nurses: Too Many or Too Few? 
 Economic Concepts of Surplus and Shortage 
 Although there is widespread agreement in many countries that a shortage of 
nurses exists, concepts of shortages and how to measure them differ. Nonecono-
mists, including many health policy analysts, tend to use two different approaches 
to define shortage. The first is a need-based approach that identifies the number 
of nurses  required to perform certain tasks according to the professional judgment. 
There is a shortage if the number of nurses needed exceeds the current employment 
of full-time-equivalent nurses. A second approach uses a ratio technique that com-
pares the current nurse/population ratio to the future nurse/population ratio and 
defines as a shortage a projected future ratio less than the existing one ( Lane and 
Gohmann 1995 ). 
 Economists define a shortage quite differently. A shortage exists when the 
quantity of nurses demanded exceeds the quantity of nurses supplied  at the current 
market wage  (  fig. 8.1 ). 2 In the standard supply-and-demand framework of econom-
ics, the quantity of nurses demanded declines with increases in the real nurses ’ 
wage and the quantity supplied increases with increases in the real wage. The 
intersection of a demand curve ( D 1 ) and a supply curve ( S 1 ) determines the equi-
librium market wage at  w 1 and employment level at  N 1 . 
2.  Similarly, a surplus 
exists when the 
quantity demanded for 
nurses is less than the 
quantity supplied of 
nurses  at the current 
market wage .

326 
 Part II / Chapter 8
 Assume that there is an exogenous shift — an outward shift in demand from 
 D 1 to  D 2 for nurses — owing to a factor external to the market for nurses, such as 
higher per capita income. Assuming that the market wage is fixed at its current 
level ( w 1 ) for some reason, such as public regulation or union contract, then the 
quantity of nurses demanded is  N 2 while the quantity of nurses supplied remains 
at  N 1 since the market wage level remains constant. Therefore, there is an excess 
demand for nurses at the existing market wage, and the magnitude of the shortage 
is the horizontal distance between  N 2 and  N 1 , ( N 2  –  N 1 ).  
 Assume the vertical line  RR  indicates the ideal level of required nurse staffing 
using clinical or medical criteria. The number of nurses required to satisfy this 
professional standard is  R , and the quantity of nursing labor supplied at the current 
market wage is  N 1 . Therefore, the shortage of nurses as measured by this noneco-
nomic approach is  R  –  N 1 . This example illustrates why there are differences in 
the estimated magnitude of shortages, depending on whether the economic 
approach or a noneconomic approach is utilized. 
 Furthermore, different approaches for measuring shortage or surplus may 
lead to different conclusions about whether a surplus or a shortage of nurses exists. 
For example, if we assume that there is a further exogenous increase in the supply

of nurses resulting from a change in government policy on recruiting nurses from 
overseas, then the supply curve of nurses become  S 2 (  fig. 8.2 ). In this case, the 
quantity of nurses supplied becomes  N 3 while the quantity of nurses demanded 
remains at  N 2 when the market wage is fixed at  w 1 . Thus, there is an excess supply 
(surplus) of nurses according to the economic approach. The surplus of nurses is 
equal to  N 3  –  N 2 . However, according to the noneconomic approach, there is a 
shortage of nurses because the number of nurses needed (determined by the  RR 
line) exceeds the quantity of nurses demanded at the current wage level ( N 2 ). The 
shortage of nurses is  R  –  N 2 .  
 Lane and Gohmann (1995)  showed how different approaches to defining 
shortages lead to different conclusions about whether or not a shortage or surplus 
exists. They used US data from 1991 to estimate parameters of equations for the 
demand for and supply of nurses. Using their parameter estimates, they defined a 
county as a shortage area if the quantity demanded exceeded the quantity supplied 
by more than 10 percent. Among the 1,880 counties in their analysis, the empirical 
model designated 423 US counties as shortage areas. By contrast, the noneconomic 
approach used by the US Office of Shortage Designations placed 565 counties in 
this category. The two approaches agreed on the shortage status of only 133 
counties.

 Different approaches for identifying shortages not only lead to different con-
clusions as to when and where shortages exist, the different approaches also result 
in different recommended policies for remedying a shortage. The noneconomic 
approach focuses on identifying a fixed need without considering market mecha-
nisms that generally lead to market clearing. Thus, the only policy option implied 
by the noneconomic approach is to shift the supply curve to eliminate a 
shortage. 
 By contrast, the economic approach implies consideration of a range of 
market mechanisms, including changes in technology, substitution possibilities 
reflecting the relative availability of factors of production, and the wage adjustment 
process. The economic approach consequently provides policy makers with more 
options for eliminating a shortage, and for the working of market mechanisms that 
complement public policies ( Lane and Gohmann 1995 ). 
 Even if we accept the economic approach as a useful guide to policy making, 
a question still remains as to why there are persistent shortages of nurses in many 
countries. A persistent nursing shortage requires two necessary conditions (  fig. 
8.1 ): (1) the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied, and (2) wage 
rigidity, so that market wages do not adjust instantaneously to an excess demand 
for the factor of production, in this context, nurses. We explain the persistence of 
nursing shortage from the perspective of these two necessary conditions. 
 The demand for nurses is a derived demand, derived from a product demand —
 the demand for acute health care and long-term care services. During the past three 
decades, many countries have experienced rapid growth in demand for health care, 
which reflects increased health insurance coverage, rising personal incomes, popu-
lation aging, technological change, and other factors (see, e.g.,  Newhouse 1992 ). In 
particular, the average annual growth rate in real health care expenditures has 
exceeded the average annual growth rate in real GDP for some time. As a result, 
the demand for nurses has increased steadily. By contrast, growth in the supply of 
nurses has not matched the rapid increase in the demand for nurses in many coun-
tries. Many countries thus appear to be suffering from nurse shortages. Although 
each country may have some specific policies that affect the supply of nurses, there 
are some common factors among countries that contribute to the slower increase 
in the supply of nurses. 
 Although the increase in the supply of nurses lags behind the increase in 
demand for nurses, the shortage would not occur if market wages could adjust 
instantaneously. Therefore, an important question to be asked in addressing the 
persistent shortage of nurses is why markets fail to clear. If wage rates adjust in 
response to the market disequilibrium between demand and supply, then the short-
age (or surplus) of nurses will be eliminated as wages rise (or fall). In this case, a 
shortage is only a temporary phenomenon. However, if there is a failure of wages 
to adjust rapidly, then the market disequilibrium will prevail in the long run. 
Therefore, it is important to ask why there is a failure of wage adjustment in the 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 329
labor market for nurses. There are two major explanations: (1) public regulation of 
nurses ’ pay and (2) monopsony power in labor market for nurses. 
 Role of Public Regulation 
 Many countries rely on the public sector to finance  and  deliver health care services 
(see chapters 11 – 13). With government substantially involved in the financing and 
provision of services, the government often finds it advantageous to regulate prices 
of health care services, and most health care workers are government employees. 
Government wages may not be responsive to market forces, or there may be a lag 
in wage adjustment ( Shields 2004 ).  
 Box 8.1 
 Unintended Consequences of Pay Regulation in Labor Markets for Nurses 
 The economic literature has shown that the net advantages of different jobs will tend 
to be equal if there is a wage competition in labor markets. As a result, a higher pay 
or a wage premium is necessary to compensate for a more risky job. Similarly, a job 
located in an area with higher cost of living receives a higher pay. The pay regulation 
of the public sector restricts the wage adjustment across heterogeneous geographic 
labor markets and hence undermines the equality of net advantages across different 
jobs, which in turn can have harmful unintended consequences. In this box, we 
review two recent studies that show the evidence of unintended consequences arising 
from pay regulation in the labor market for nurses. 
 In the UK, pay for nurses and physicians in NHS hospitals is regulated to a precise 
national scale that is almost uniform across the country and allows only minor dif-
ferences in pay between different areas. Since the private sector does not regulate the 
wage and the supply of labor is determined by the relative pay offered in different 
jobs, the little spatial variation in nurses ’ pay affects the competitiveness of pay for 
nurses between local labor markets, which in turn affects recruitment and retention. 
Elliott and colleagues empirically measured the competitiveness of pay for nurses by 
calculating the difference between standardized spatial wage differentials (SSWDs) 
estimated for nurses and comparator occupations, hereafter referred as the SSWD gap 
( Elliot, Ma, Scott, et al. 2007 ). The authors first showed that there are substantial 
variations in SSWDs between different areas. They then estimated the effect of the 
SSWD gap on the ability of the NHS to attract and retain nurses, as measured by 
vacancy rates for qualified nurses. The estimated coefficient is significantly negative, 
indicating that NHS nursing vacancies are lower if NHS nurses have higher wages 
than persons in the comparator occupations. For every 10 percent increase in the gap 
between the relative pay of nurses and that of their comparators, vacancy rates in the 
NHS decrease by 0.18 to 1.71 percentage points, depending on the comparator group 
chosen. 
 Another recent study further empirically examined the effect of the wage gap 
between nurses and other occupations on hospital outcomes. Propper and Van Reenen 

330 
 Part II / Chapter 8
 Under dual public financing and provision, the government may operate 
under a fixed budget constraint (  fig. 8.3 ). Given a fixed budget, the public health 
care system can employ more nurses if the wages of nurses are set at lower levels, 
and vice versa. Thus, the budget constraint can be expressed as a rectangular 
hyperbola with the vertical axis representing the wage rates and the horizontal axis 
the number of nurses employed, shown as the  B curve in   figure 8.3 . Although the 
 B curve represents a potential long-run trade-off, at a point in time, public employ-
ers are generally restrained from reducing employment by work rules, such as those 
pertaining to seniority. The downward-sloping ( D ) and upward-sloping ( S ) curves 
represent the demand and supply of nurses, respectively. The horizontal line ( w g ) 
represents the wage level of nurses, which is set by the government. Persistent 
nurse shortages exist because  w g is lower than the equilibrium market wage ( w *). 
When nurses are offered  w g , the quantity supplied of nurses is  N s , which is deter-
mined by the intersection of  w g and the supply curve. However, at  w g , the quantity 
measured the above-mentioned wage gap by wage level outside of the regulated sector, 
hereafter referred to as outside wage ( Propper, and van Reenen 2010 ). The authors 
argued that nurses supply less labor (including lower participation rates, fewer quali-
fied staff offering themselves for work, and higher rates of vacancies and turnover) 
when better outside opportunities are available locally, as measured by higher wages 
in the outside labor market relative to the wage inside the hospital. Thus, areas with 
higher outside wages would be at a disadvantage in recruiting, retaining, and motivat-
ing higher-quality workers. Consequently, higher outside wages lead to poorer out-
comes of hospitalized patients. Their empirical study lends support this view, finding 
that a 10 percent increase in the outside wage is associated with a 4 – 8 percent increase 
in mortality within 30 days of emergency admission for patients with acute myo-
cardial infarction. They also found that the negative association between firm 
performance and the outside wage is unique to the regulated sector (hospitals) because 
they did not find the same relationships in other 43 service sectors in which their 
pay was not regulated. This result suggests that the negative effect of outside wages 
on hospital performance is not simply due to fewer staff or general UK labor market 
conditions. Rather, there is evidence that this effect arises from the fact that hospitals 
in high-outside-wage areas tend to rely disproportionately on temporary agency staff, 
which in turn is associated with poorer health outcomes. 
 An important policy implication from these two studies is that a uniform increase 
in wage rates for nurses is not an effective approach for easing a shortage of nurses 
and improving quality of health care. Rather, a more effective approach for reducing 
nursing shortages in the NHS is to introduce policies leading to a greater responsive-
ness of nurses ’ pay to local labor market conditions, that is, paying more to reduce 
excess demand gaps for nurses.

of nurses demanded is  N d , which is determined by the intersection of  w g , the 
demand curve, and the budget constraint. Since the quantity demanded exceeds 
the quantity supplied at  w g , there is a shortage of nurses, the horizontal distance 
between  N d and  N s .  
 Governments have several options for eliminating a shortage. First, the regula-
tory agency can increase the wage, perhaps to a higher wage but one still below 
the market-clearing wage. The higher wage in turn increases the quantity of nurses 
supplied through these two channels: (1) increased hours of work per nurse already 
employed and (2) an increase in labor force participation and employment of 
persons trained in nursing. Also, the increase in wage level may induce a substitu-
tion of other inputs for nurses, such as a reduction in the skill mix of nursing 
personnel or the use of relatively more nurse-saving capital. 
 For example, the use of disposable supplies may save nurse time. By config-
uring hospital space in certain ways, it becomes easier to view activities on the 
hospital floor, and hence it may be possible to employ nurses more efficiently. As 
a result, the quantity of nurses demanded decreases. 
 Changes in quantity supplied and demanded working together reduce the gap 
between demand and supply. Therefore, an increase in the government-determined 
wage and the budget share can potentially reduce the magnitude of nurse shortages. 
However, the phenomenon of a nurse shortage still exists as long as the wage rate

offered by public employers is below the market equilibrium wage, and the budget 
constraint cannot sustain the employment level under the market equilibrium 
wage. 
 Second, nurse shortages can be mitigated or eliminated by policies that shift 
the supply curve outward. In the short run, a shift of labor supply curve can be 
achieved by recruiting more nurses from overseas. Many high-income countries 
have adopted this strategy for solving their nursing shortages. But this approach 
just shifts nurse shortages from high-income countries to other countries unless 
the other countries have nonemployed nurses. In the long run, a shift in the labor 
supply curve may be achieved by increasing nursing school enrollments.  
 Box 8.2 
 International Nurse Migration 
 Many countries have relied on recruiting nurses from foreign countries as a strategy 
for solving the problem of a nursing shortage. This strategy has accelerated interna-
tional nurse migration. As a result, nurses from other countries, hereafter referred as 
foreign nurses, are likely to play an increasingly large role in providing nursing care 
in several developed countries. As shown in   figure 8.4,  the major host countries of 
international nurse migration include Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the 
United States, and the UK. In these countries, the share of foreign nurses ranges from 
3 percent in Germany to 21 percent in New Zealand. In terms of total number 
employed, the United States is the largest host country of foreign nurses, although its 
share of foreign nurses is only about 5 percent. According to the World Health Orga-
nization ’ s 2006 World Health Report, nearly 100,000 foreign nurses are employed in 
the United States. Furthermore, the relative importance of foreign nurses has increased 
rapidly in the United States if we count the share of foreign nurses from employment 
growth. Between 1983 and 2003, foreign nurses accounted for nearly one-third of the 
total growth of nurse employment in the US nurse labor market ( Buerhaus, Staiger, 
and Auerbach 2004 ). 
 The major source countries of foreign nurses are India, Nigeria, Philippines, South 
Africa, and Zimbabwe, which are middle- and low-income countries. In addition, the 
nurse density per 1,000 population in these source countries ranges from 0.45 to 4.72, 
which in general is significantly lower than the nurse density in host countries 
( Aiken, Buchan, Sochlaski, et al. 2004 ). Thus, it is important to explore further the 
consequences of international nurse migration. 
 There are two important consequences of international nurse migration. On the 
one hand, international nurse migration imposes a negative externality on the source 
countries in the sense that host countries ’ use of international recruitment to fill their 
vacancies may exacerbate nursing shortages in the source countries. For example, 
Zimbabwe, a country whose nurse density is only about 1.29 per 1,000 population, 
lost 32 percent of its nurses to employment in the UK between 1999 and 2001 ( Kingma 
2007 ). On the other hand, migrant nurses send money home to their families, and 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service

 Both of these approaches have shortcomings. The approach of increasing 
wages substantially may be infeasible because of seniority rules. Public systems in 
particular are likely to have rules protecting the jobs of currently employed persons. 
Increasing wages appreciably will lead to wages far greater than the minimum 
levels of compensation many nurses in the workforce require for supplying the 
labor they supply. Thus, there is an increase in economic rents. And shifting 
supply, particularly through increases in the capacity of nursing schools, will 
take time for a meaningful increase in the supply of active nurses to be realized. 
A more feasible approach is a mixed strategy that combines both wage adjustment 
and supply-shifting approaches. For example, wages may be increased somewhat 
and more funds allocated to the employer ’ s budget, in effect shifting the budget 
such remittances have significantly contributed to the decline in the poverty rate in 
several low-income countries, such as Uganda. Furthermore, remittances from foreign 
nurses and other migrants constitute a significant portion of the GDP in several source 
countries, and the importance of remittances to the national economy may even 
exceed foreign direct investment. For example, total recorded remittances (from 
foreign nurses and other migrants) account for about 10 percent of GDP in the Philip-
pines ( Kingma 2007 ).

constraint curve ( B ) outward. Meanwhile, some combinations of supply-side poli-
cies, such as recruiting more nurses from overseas and increasing nursing school 
enrollments, may shift the supply curve outward. 
 The curves in figure 8.3 are drawn to illustrate general propositions. The 
theory makes no statement about the actual positions or shapes of these curves. 
 There are important empirical questions, the answers to which should guide 
public policy. First, how responsive is the nurse labor supply to changes in the 
wage rate? If the supply curve is quite inelastic, offering a higher wage will not 
elicit much added supply. Second, to the extent that supply increases, does the 
increased supply primarily come from increased hours of work, from higher rates 
of labor force participation of nurses not currently employed, or from persons not 
currently trained as nurses and nurses from other countries? Third, what is the 
relative effect of changing wages versus shifting the supply curve in reducing 
nursing shortages? If the labor supply decisions of nurses are responsive to wage 
changes, then the adjustment in the wage is an effective approach for coping with 
nurse shortages. Otherwise, shifting the labor supply curve becomes a more effec-
tive policy option to address the issue of nurse shortages. We examine the evidence 
on these empirical questions below. 
 Role of Monopsony Power 
 An alternative explanation for a persistent shortage of nurses is monopsony in 
nurse labor markets. Monopsony occurs when there is a single buyer in an input 
market, which is parallel to the concept of monopoly when there is a single seller 
in a product market. Buyers may possess monopsony power in an input market if 
(1) they are a single buyer and (2) the mobility of the input is restricted to that 
market. 
 Hospitals in single-hospital markets may be monopsonists if they are the only 
buyers of a specialized type of personnel and if the personnel are not in a position 
to consider alternative sources of employment outside the local market because 
commuting or moving is costly. Because both conditions are often satisfied in the 
context of nurses, especially with regard to hospital employment, the labor market 
for nurses is often offered as an example of monopsony ( Hirsch and Schumacher 
1995 ;  Boal and Ransom 1997 ). 
 Even if many hospitals are monopsonists in the market for nurses, this cer-
tainly cannot be true of many other hospitals, particularly the many hospitals 
located in metropolitan areas, unless they are involved in collusive wage agree-
ments among the competing hospitals; such collusive arrangements would have to 
be established on a market-by-market basis. The existence of collusion in wage 
setting in one geographic market does not necessarily imply it exists in other geo-
graphic markets. 
 Alternatively, rather than there being a single buyer of a specialized input 
such as professional nurses, employers may compete with one another to some 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 335
extent. In markets with few buyers, the labor market for nurses may be appropri-
ately described as  “ oligopsonistic ” rather than monopsonistic, which is parallel to 
the concept of oligopoly in a product market ( Bhaskar, Manning, and To 2002 ). 
Both oligopsony and monopsony describe a market in which employers have the 
ability or market power to set the wage rate. 
 By contrast, the employer does not possess any market power to influence 
market wage rates determined in a perfectly competitive labor market; the employer 
is a  “ wage taker ” rather than a  “ wage setter. ” When a wage taker, the individual 
employer must accept the wage rate determined by market forces, and there is only 
one single market wage rate for a given quality of worker. 
 The monopsony case is simpler than the oligopsony case since with the latter 
one must consider strategic interactions among employers, and the results of any 
conceptual analysis are likely to be weaker. Thus, we focus on monopsony here. 
The bottom line for monopsony is that both the wage rate and employment levels 
are lower than would prevail under perfect competition. 
 In   figure 8.5 , the downward-sloping curve represents the marginal revenue 
product (MRP) of nurses, which also represents the demand for labor. The MRP is 
the product of the marginal product of the input, in this case nurses, and marginal 
revenue. For example, if adding a nurse will allow the hospital to accept four 
additional patients for treatment, the MRP is four times the marginal revenue,

which, since marginal revenue is less than the product price, is less than the hos-
pital ’ s price of care.  
 The lower upward-sloping curve is the labor supply curve, indicating that 
more workers are drawn into employment as the wage rises. The single employer 
realizes that to attract more nurses, it has to offer a higher wage rate. The analysis 
makes the fairly realistic assumption that it is not possible for employers to wage 
discriminate among employees, that is, to offer a higher wage to a newly employed 
worker than to an existing worker. 
 For this reason, an increase in the wage rate must be paid not only to 
new employees but to existing ones as well. Suppose the hospital has 100 
employees and the wage is $20 per hour. To attract another employee, the hospital 
raises the wage to $21. However, it cannot simply pay the new employees $1 extra. 
Rather, it must pay $121 extra per hour — $100 more to its existing workers and 
$21 to the new worker, which is the marginal labor cost (MLC). 
 An important implication is that the MLC curve lies above the upward-
sloping labor supply curve (  fig. 8.5 ). The MLC curve, not the supply curve, is the 
relevant curve the employer uses in determining how many workers it wants to 
employ. In making this decision, a firm pursuing profit maximization determines 
its optimal employment level at the point where MRP equals MLC, shown as point 
 B in f  igure 8.3 , and optimal employment is  l m . 
 At this employment level, the monopsonist determines the wage level from 
the labor supply curve, point  C in   figure 8.5 , with a corresponding wage level of 
 w m . At this wage, the firm ’ s demand for labor is  l m *, which is determined by an 
MRP corresponding to wage level  w m (point  D ). Therefore, a  “ shortage ” of labor 
exists, as measured by the difference  l m *  –  l m , in the sense that the firm desires to 
hire additional workers at the monoposonistic wage ( w m ), but it cannot do so while 
simultaneously maximizing profit. This is because the firm needs to raise wage 
rates to attract more workers beyond  l m , and a higher wage above  w m would 
decrease its profitability. However, the firm may post the difference  l m *  –  l m as the 
number of job openings it has. It will constantly be looking for workers for posi-
tions it cannot fill. 
 Policy makers, however, may be misled into thinking that the difference 
represents true excess demand, and implement policies designed to close the gap. 
Even if they do not act on this information, the existence of vacancies may be 
interpreted as a shortage, and this shortage may be reported to international agen-
cies such as the OECD. 
 A key assumption underlying the monopsony model is limited mobility of 
labor, which may occur for three possible reasons. First, the workers may not have 
perfect information about alternative possible jobs. Second, it is costly for workers 
to move between employers, especially when they are geographically dispersed. 
Third, workers may have heterogeneous preferences for different jobs ( Bhaskar, 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 337
Manning, and To 2002 ). If mobility of labor were free, workers would switch jobs 
if employers continued to offer wages below the competitive levels. But with 
limited mobility of labor, the employer reasons that it is unlikely that the worker 
will leave, which confers market power to set a wage below the level that would 
prevail in a competitive market. In a competitive labor market, the equilibrium 
wage is  w c , which is set at the intersection of the labor supply curve and the MRP 
curve, and the corresponding employment level is  l c (f  ig. 8.5 ). 
 This result has two important implications. First, under competition, employ-
ers can hire all the workers they want at the going wage. Thus, there is no excess 
demand or shortage in the economic sense in the labor market. Second, the wage 
paid to employees is equal to their MRP. Both outcomes suggest that the later 
market equilibrium is efficient. 
 By contrast, in a monopsonistic market, the equilibrium is not efficient for 
these reasons. First, vacancies persist under monopsony. Second, employment 
under monopsony ( l m ) is less than that which prevails in a competitive market ( l c ). 
Third, the equilibrium wage level under monopsony ( w m ) is less than the workers ’ 
MRP, as shown by the vertical distance between points  B and  C . The gap between 
MRP and wage under the monopsony is: 
 E = ( MRP  –  w )/ w = 1/ ε ,  
(8.1) 
 where  ε is the elasticity of the supply of labor to the employer with respect to the 
wage.  E measures the departure of wages paid to employees from their MRP in 
percentage terms. In the economics literature,  E is often interpreted as a measure 
of  “ exploitation, ”  or more precisely as the amount of exploitation that employees 
are exploited ( Boal and Ransom 1997 ). 
 Also,  E is often used to measure the employer ’ s market power. According to 
equation 8.1, the departure of wage from the MRP is inversely related to the elas-
ticity of labor supply, indicating that the more inelastic labor supply is to the 
employer, the wider is the gap between the MRP and the wage. In a perfectly com-
petitive market,  E is zero since the elasticity of labor supply approaches infinity 
and hence the employer does not possess any market power. The value of  E is rela-
tively large if the elasticity of labor supply is small, indicating that employers 
facing relatively inelastic labor supply curves possess relatively much market 
power. 
 The monopsony model is attractive, at least theoretically, for describing 
important stylized facts about nurse labor markets. Particularly in countries with 
public health care systems, the government is the buyer of services of specialized 
health personnel. However, the monopsony framework is based on an assumption 
of profit maximization, and it is a stretch to apply this model to public employers. 
While the model seems more applicable to private employers, it is important to 

338 
 Part II / Chapter 8
recall that many health care employers, especially hospitals, are organized on a 
private not-for-profit basis. 
 Such organizations may have many different goals. It is conceptually possible 
that such an organization may have such nonpecuniary objectives as teaching, 
research, or providing care to the poor (see chapter 6). However, to serve these 
objectives, it may want to behave as a profit maximizer would in input markets. 
In this sense, the monopsony model could still be applicable. In the end, whether 
or not health sector employers are monopsonists or oligopsonists cannot be decided 
on the basis of theory alone. Rather, this is an empirical question. We return to this 
issue below. 
 8.3 
 Empirical Estimates of Nurses ’ Response to a 
Wage Change 
 There are two approaches to test empirically whether the labor market for nurses 
is a monopsony. The first approach is to estimate the elasticity of labor supply of 
nurses to an  individual  hospital. In general, the elasticity of labor supply to an 
individual firm will differ substantially from the elasticity of labor supply to the 
market as a whole. In fact, in a competitive labor market, the individual firm faces 
an infinitely elastic labor supply curve even if the curve for the market as a whole 
is upward sloping. However, under monopsony, the two supply curves are the 
same. As shown in equation 8.1, the difference of the wage from the corresponding 
MRP is inversely related to the elasticity of labor supply. Thus, the wage elasticity 
of labor supply yields an estimate of the extent of measuring monopsony power. 
In addition, estimating the wage elasticity of labor supply provides an empirical 
basis for understanding the extent to which nurse labor supply responds to wage 
changes, which in turn provides useful evidence for evaluating whether increasing 
nurse pay is an effective policy instrument for easing shortages of nurses, as econo-
mists define them ( Shields 2004 ). 
 The second approach for gauging monopsony power and its extent is to 
examine the relationship among hospital wages, employment, and market struc-
ture. The rationale for this approach is that the presence of an upward-sloping labor 
supply curve is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the existence of mon-
opsony power. Thus, estimating the wage elasticity of nurse labor supply is insuf-
ficient to demonstrate evidence of a monopsonistic outcome. Rather, the 
determinants of wage and employment outcomes must be directly tested ( Hirsch 
and Schumacher 1995 ,  2005 ). 
 The monopsony model predicts that nurses ’ wages decline as hospital con-
centration increases. While strictly speaking, a monoponist is a single purchaser 
of a specialized factor of production, having fewer employers in a market may 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 339
facilitate collusive arrangements among employers that compete for the same types 
of labor. 
 Several studies have estimated the effects of wage on the labor supply of 
nurses since 1970.  3 These studies apply diverse econometric and other statistical 
methods to data from various countries. Most use cross-sectional data at the level 
of the US state, the hospital, or the individual nurse, while only a few studies have 
employed individual-level panel data on nurses. 
 The wage elasticity estimates for the nurse labor supply from previous studies 
fall within a wide range, from  – 0.39 to 2.8, but most estimates fall within a nar-
rower range, from 0.1 to 1.5 ( Antonazzo, Scott, Skatun, et al. 2003 ;  Shields 2004 ). 
This is still an enormous range, with estimates around 0.1, implying that supply 
is inelastic, to estimates in excess of one, implying a considerable supply response 
to wage changes. 
 There are four important questions to be addressed in estimating the labor 
supply of nurses. First, does an increased wage provide an incentive for nurses to 
increase the number of hours they work? In theory, the effects of changing the wage 
rate on number of hours worked are twofold, which can be described by a substitu-
tion effect and an income effect. The substitution effect describes the incentive that 
workers have to work more as the wage rises. The wage represents the opportunity 
cost (price) of leisure (not working), and leisure becomes more expensive when 
wages increase. But assuming that more leisure is demanded when income 
increases, workers also have an incentive to work less when wages increase. The 
income effect indicates the extent to which an increase in the wage leads to a 
reduction in the number of hours worked because the demand for leisure increases 
as the rising wage increases the nurses ’ incomes. The two effects operate in oppo-
site directions, a wage increase leading to more hours according to the substitution 
effect and fewer hours according to the income effect. 
 At a low wage, the income effect may not be sufficiently strong to dominate 
the substitution effect. Therefore, the increase in wage often leads to an increase 
in the number of hours worked, which suggests that the labor supply curve is 
upward sloping (  fig. 8.6 ). However, as wage rates rise, the negative income effect 
on work hours may become sufficiently large to outweigh the positive substitution 
effect on work hours. The number of hours worked may consequently decrease as 
the wage rises, which leads to a backward-bending labor supply curve.  
 Only a few empirical studies provide evidence of a backward-bending labor 
supply, that is, where the wage elasticity of the labor supply is negative ( Bognanno, 
Hixson, and Jeffers 1974 ;  Link 1992 ). The majority of such studies find that the 
wage elasticity of the labor supply is positive, suggesting that the nurse ’ s labor 
supply is upward sloping. 
 The second question concerns the relative effectiveness of the wage increase 
on labor force participation and on the number-of-hours decision for those who 
work. In practice, some qualified nurses may decide not to go to work because the

reviews on these

prevailing market wage is below their reservation wage. The reservation wage 
represents the minimum wage required to elicit a unit of labor from the supplier 
of labor. This minimum wage reflects the person ’ s productivity in nonmarket work 
(work in the household, e.g., child care, help with children ’ s homework, cooking, 
cleaning, paying bills, and purely leisure time). For a person to supply a unit of 
labor, the market wage must be at least as high as the reservation wage. 
 In this case, an increase in wage leads to an increase in the nurses ’ labor 
supply at both the extensive and intensive margins. The extensive margin involves 
the decision to participate in a market transaction at all. In this application, this 
is the decision to participate in the nurse labor market. The intensive margin 
involves the decision of how much to transact, in this application, the amount of 
labor to supply, conditional on supplying at least one unit of labor to the market. 
An increased wage may encourage some nurses who previously had not sought 
work to do so — the decision at the extensive margin. But it also may encourage 
more hours of work by those who participate — the decision at the intensive margin. 
Whether or not the participation effect exceeds the hours-of-work effect or the 
converse cannot be decided theoretically but rather is an empirical question. 
 Some empirical studies assess only the determinants of nurse labor force 
participation, while others focus only on hours-of-work responses to wage changes 
and other factors.  Sloan and Richupan (1975)  used 1960 US Census data to assess 
both. They found that the number of hours worked is more responsive to wage

changes than is labor force participation. They reported that a 1.0 percent increase 
in nurses ’ wage rates increased their labor force participation by 1.8 percent and 
increased the number of hours worked by 2.8 percent. 
 By contrast, a study conducted with 1980 data from the UK by  Phillips (1995)  
suggests that labor force participation is more responsive to wage changes than is 
the number of hours worked. He found that a 1.0 percent wage increase led to an 
increase in labor force participation of 1.4 percent but led to an increase in hours 
worked of only 0.15 percent. Even though the two studies addressed both partici-
pation and work hours, the results come from two different countries and two 
distinct time periods. Work patterns of women were different in 1980 than in 1960, 
a period before women ’ s rights in the workplace were emphasized. 
 The third empirical question is whether or not labor supply is more respon-
sive to wage changes in the long run than in the short run. Theoretically, one would 
expect the mobility of nurses across markets and the adjustment of working hours 
to likely be higher in the long run than in the short run. Thus, the magnitude of 
employer market power is likely to be lower in the long run than in the short run. 
 Empirical research by  Sullivan (1989)  provides empirical evidence in support 
of this premise. His results indicate that the wage elasticity of the labor supply of 
nurses over a one-year period is 1.26 and over a three-year period is 3.86. These 
results thus indicate that hospitals have very substantial monopsony power in the 
labor market for nurses and that the monopsony power in the short run (1/1.26 = 
0.79) is substantially larger than in the long run (1/3.86 = 0.26). This inference 
applies only to markets with a single employer or at most a few who can collude. 
Establishing such evidence from aggregate supply curves is not a sufficient condi-
tion for monopsony but rather a first step. 
 Finally, we consider methodological issues of the various studies. Three 
emphasized here are issues related to (1) the samples used in the empirical analy-
sis, (2) establishing that wage rates truly affect supply, and the observed relation-
ship is not driven by effects of supply on wages, and (3) measurement errors in 
wage rates from survey data ( Antonazzo, Scott, Skatun, et al. 2003 ). 
 Some of these problems have been overcome by using better data or appropri-
ate econometric techniques. For example, to handle the problem of reverse causal-
ity, that is, wage rates affecting supply  and supply affecting wage rates,  Staiger, 
Spetz, and Phibbs (1999)  took advantage of data from a natural experiment.  4 In 
1991, the US Veterans Administration, which operates hospitals throughout the 
United States, changed its method for setting nurses ’ wages from paying nurses 
based on a national scale to paying nurses according to a system that set wage 
levels referenced to data from local wage surveys. Thus, in some areas wages fell 
and in others they rose, but the change in wages was independent of changes in 
nurse supply. 
 Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs estimated a short-run elasticity of labor supply to 
an individual hospital of 0.1, the lowest supply elasticity estimate in the literature. 
4.  On natural 
experiments, see 
chapter 3.

342 
 Part II / Chapter 8
This suggests that other estimates that do not explicitly account for reverse causal-
ity may be overestimates of the true relationship. 
 Askildsen, Baltagi, and Holm å s (2003 ) addressed the same issue by using 
longitudinal data obtained on nearly 20,000 Norwegian nurses observed over a 
six-year period (1993 – 1998). They obtained a labor supply elasticity of 0.21, almost 
the same as Staiger, Spetz, and Phibbs did. 
 As emphasized above, estimating the labor supply elasticity is only one step 
in ascertaining whether or not a market for nurses is monopsonistic. If there is 
more than one buyer of labor, there is an issue of whether or not they collude in 
setting wages. Since direct evidence of collusion is difficult for us as outsiders to 
this market to observe, economists study factors that would facilitate such 
collusion. 
 At the top of the list is a concentration of labor purchasers. Some early studies 
found a statistically significant effect of market concentration on nurses ’ wages. 
For example,  Link and Landon (1976)  observed that wages are lower when there 
are fewer hospitals in a geographic area or, in economic terminology, when hospital 
markets are more concentrated. Unfortunately, market concentration is associated 
with other factors, such as population density, which are also likely to be associ-
ated with wages. In a rural community, there is likely to be only one hospital 
employer, but in a city with a million residents, there are likely to be many. Thus, 
a result that wages are lower in markets with a highly concentrated hospital sector 
may only mean that concentration is negatively correlated with population density, 
and it is density, not concentration, that affects wages. In the end, it may really 
take some direct empirical evidence of coordination among hospital employers in 
a large city to establish the existence of monopsony there ( Adamache and Sloan 
1982 ;  Boal and Ransom 1997 ). 
 Hirsch and Schumacher (1995) tested the presence of monopsony power by 
examining relative nursing versus non-nursing wage rates across markets that they 
argued were more and less likely to be monopsonistic. By measuring nursing wages 
relative to non-nursing wages within the same labor market, this study controlled 
for differences in cost of living and other area-specific factors. 
 In theory, the monopsony model predicts that the relative nursing/non-nurs-
ing wage is lower in labor markets that are small and with a limited number of 
employers. Based on data from the 1985 – 1993 US Current Population Surveys, 
however, Hirsch and Schumacher found no evidence to support this prediction. 
 Ten years later,  Hirsch and Schumacher (2005)  presented a new method for 
obtaining evidence on monopsony in nurse labor markets. They used the fraction 
of new recruits from nonemployment (unemployment or outside the labor force) 
as a new measure of monopsonistic power. Conceptually, mobility of labor reduces 
the ability of individual employers to set wages. Thus, they predicted that the lower 
the proportion of new hires coming from employment with other firms (i.e., the 
higher the fraction of new recruits from nonemployment), the lower are expected 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service

wages, other things being equal. This relationship was not supported empirically, 
however, implying that monopsony power is lacking in this sector. 
 8.4 
 Nonwage Determinants of the Nurse Labor 
Supply 
 Nurses ’ decisions to supply labor to the market are plausibly motivated by a 
number of factors in addition to wages. For one, nursing is a profession for which 
intrinsic rewards are important, such as being able to function in the workplace as 
a decision maker (see, e.g.,  Shields 2004 ;  Heyes 2005 ). 
 Although unlike in other social sciences, the focus of economic analysis has 
been on the effects of financial incentives, particularly in recent years there has 
been some theoretical research on nonfinancial incentives as well. In this research 
there is a distinction between intrinsic motivation, the desire to perform a task for 
its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, in which explicit rewards, including pay, 
promotion, and recognition (e.g., medals for outstanding performance) or penalties 
to elicit willingness to perform tasks (see, e.g.,  Golden and Sloan 2008 ). This body 
of theoretical research, which is based on a substantial amount of experimental 
and field research by noneconomists, indicates that extrinsic motivation may 
crowd out effort that would have been forthcoming in the absence of extrinsic 
motivators. 
 For example, offering compensation for a task may suggest to the worker that 
he or she either is not motivated to perform the task, absent the incentive, or faces 
a high cost of performing it. In the former case, offering an incentive makes the 
worker think that the boss does not trust his or her motivation to do the task 
without a bribe. In the latter case, the boss knows that the task is arduous and tries 
to bribe the worker to undertake it. Absent an explicit incentive, the worker may 
think that the task is easy. With the bribe, the worker becomes suspicious that he 
or she is being unduly influenced. 
 In health care, societies have traditionally relied on professionalism, intrinsic 
motivation, to achieve desirable outcomes. This has been thought to provide a 
motivation for health professionals to perform in the interests of patients. There is 
a risk that offering explicit rewards for good acts will crowd out intrinsic 
motivation. 
 While much of the economic literature focuses on wage as a motivator,  Heyes 
(2005)  presents a simple model suggesting that increasing the wage may actually 
decrease the proportion of employed nurses who view nursing as a vocation, and 
hence the overall performance of nurses in patient care may decline.  Heyes (2005)  
models how the nurse views this work as a dichotomous variable. A nurse who 
does not place an emphasis on the professional aspect of nursing will work if and 

344 
 Part II / Chapter 8
only if the market wage exceeds her reservation wage. By contrast, nurses who 
view nursing as a professional career will choose to work if and only if the market 
wage plus a premium (a nonpecuniary benefit or intrinsic reward) is greater than 
their reservation wage. At a given market wage, individuals who view nursing as 
a profession are more likely to choose this field as a career, other factors being 
equal. Therefore, the proportion of employed nurses who have a professional ori-
entation to nursing decreases as market wages increase. 
 This conclusion is the opposite of the  efficient wage hypothesis , which main-
tains that higher wages boost job performance ( Summers 1988 ). A key assumption 
in Heyes ’ s model that leads to this difference in conclusions is that more highly 
productive nurses tend to have lower reservation wages. Thus, an important impli-
cation of his model is that there is an efficiency loss arising from the employment 
of the wrong type of nurses if the policy makers try to raise nursing wages to reduce 
an excess demand for nurses. 
 Utility from being a professional in nursing is a nonwage attribute of the 
nursing profession that may affect nurse labor supply. Conversely, data from the 
British National Health Service (NHS) in the UK and from Norway indicate that 
job dissatisfaction is a major factor in nurses ’ decisions to quit ( Shields and Ward 
2001 ;  Holm å s 2002 ). Sources of dissatisfaction may relate to extrinsic as well as 
intrinsic factors. In the Norwegian study, nurses working at hospitals with a high 
occupancy rate or a relatively large number of hospital beds per nurse were more 
likely to quit their jobs. 
 Having discussed determinants of nurse supply, we now turn to the demand 
side. As previously discussed, the demand for nurses reflects their MRP. Included 
in MRP is the marginal product of the nurse. Although in a traditional setting, the 
product might be considered an output such as a hospital day, in health care, the 
trend has been to consider more refined measures of output (see chapter 7). 
 8.5 
 Nurses in the Production of Hospital Services 
 Do Higher Nurse-to-Patient Ratios Improve the Quality of 
Hospital Care? 
 Nurses provide an important input in the production of personal health care ser-
vices, of which hospital inpatient care is an excellent but by no means the only 
example. Nurses monitor changes inpatient status, which can lead to early detec-
tion and prompt intervention that improves individuals ’ long-term health and 
saves patients ’ lives. When staffing levels are lean, nurse workloads tend to increase, 
which in turn may decrease the effectiveness of nurse surveillance in hospitals. A 
widely held notion is that inadequate nursing staffing is a major impediment to 
the provision of high-quality hospital care ( Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, et al. 2002 ). The 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 345
high variability of nurse staffing levels in hospitals, which includes low staffing 
on the left tail of the distribution of hospitals by nurse staffing levels, has raised a 
serious policy concern about whether or not hospital nurse staffing levels are 
adequate to provide safe and effective care. Furthermore, hospitals around the 
world have faced dramatic changes in their operating environments since about 
the 1990s for various reasons, including the diffusion of managed care in the United 
States and the reforms of the hospital payment system in many other countries, 
including the United States ( Gaynor and Haas-Wilson 1999 ). 
 Insofar as spending on nursing personnel amounts to approximately 30 
percent of hospital budgets on average, many hospitals have reduced nurse staffing 
as one of their strategies to respond to a tightening in the market environment 
( Mark, Harless, McCue, et al. 2004 ). This trend, in combination with the persistent 
shortages of nurses, has led to studies being conducted to examine the relationship 
between nurse staffing and the quality of hospital care empirically. 
 Overall, empirical support for the view that richer nurse staffing leads to 
better patient care is mixed. Recent studies in the medical literature have tended 
to be more supportive of a relationship between staffing and quality than those in 
the economics literature have. 
 The existing literature can be divided into (1) cross-hospital studies, (2) 
within-hospital comparisons, and (3) longitudinal studies. The cross-hospital 
studies conduct cross-sectional analyses by comparing different hospitals at a point 
in time. For example, in a study published in a major medical journal,  Aiken, 
Clarke, Sloane, et al. (2002)  used data from 168 communities in the US state of 
Pennsylvania to examine the impact of nurse staffing levels on patient outcomes. 
Aiken and coauthors measured nurse staffing by the mean patient load per nurse. 
Patient outcomes were 30-day mortality (the percentage of patients who died 
within 30 days of the date they were admitted to the hospital) and  “ failure to 
rescue ”  (the percentage of cases in which patients died who would not have died 
had they received appropriate care). The authors found that hospitals with higher 
nurse-to-patient ratios had lower probabilities of adverse patient outcomes occur-
ring, after controlling for the patient and hospital characteristics. 
 Similarly, in another medical article reporting results from data on 799 hos-
pitals in eleven US states,  Needleman, Buerhaus, Mattke, et al. (2002)  examined 
the relationship between time spent per patient by nurses on patient outcomes, 
fourteen types of outcomes (including shorter length of stay; lower rates of urinary 
tract infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, shock or cardiac arrest; 
and failure to rescue) occurring during hospitalization. They reported that more 
time spent by professional nurses with patients led to better patient outcomes in 
general, but they found no relationship between time spent by professional nurses 
and the probability of  in-hospital  death. 
 Although these cross-hospital studies imply that richer nurse staffing gener-
ally leads to better outcomes of care in hospital settings, they are subject to criticism 

346 
 Part II / Chapter 8
on the grounds that it may not be nurse staffing per se that leads to improved 
outcomes but rather the effect of some third omitted factor. For example, an institu-
tion may have other types of staffing that produce better outcomes or may have 
stronger nursing leadership that advocates both for more nurse employees and for 
hospital-wide processes leading to higher quality of care at the facility. In economic 
jargon, failure to include such third factors leads to  “ omitted variables bias, ” that 
is, to an overstatement (in this case; see  Mark, Harless, McCue, et al. 2004 ;  Evans 
and Kim 2006 ) or an understatement of a variable ’ s true effect. Such a third vari-
able may be medical technology.  
 Box 8.3 
 Correlation versus Causation 
 The debates in the literature regarding the effect of nurse staffing on the quality of 
health care provided do not align with whether there is a positive relationship 
between nurse staffing and health outcomes. Rather, the debates focus on whether 
this positive relationship is a causal relation or just a correlation. The causation argu-
ment states that an increase in the level of nurse staffing causes an improvement in 
health outcomes. However, the correlation argument states that there are common 
third variables that are important determinants of both nurse staffing and quality of 
health care. One or more third variables affect both nurse staffing and health outcomes 
in the same direction. Thus, there is an observed positive relationship between nurse 
staffing and quality of health care. These two arguments can be illustrated by the 
following graph: 
 The causation hypothesis emphasizes that the positive relationship between nurse 
staffing and quality of health care comes from the direct causal relation, that is,  X 
causes  Y . The third-variable hypothesis emphasizes that any observed positive rela-
tionship results from an indirect correlation — that is, one or more third variables, 
such as  Z , affects  X and  Y in the same direction simultaneously. 
 In this chapter, we have mentioned that a potential third variable that affects both 
nurse staffing and quality of health care in the same direction is medical technology. 
Whether the causation hypothesis or the third-variable hypothesis provides a better 
explanation of the positive relationship between nurse staffing and quality of health 
care is an empirical issue and requires a more rigorous study.

 The debate on causation and third-variable hypotheses is not unique in the posi-
tive relationship between nurse staffing and quality of health care. There are many 
similar cases. For example, there is also a debate over the explanation for the observed 
positive correlation between schooling and health: one explanation argues that there 
is a causal relationship that runs from increases in schooling to increases in health; 
while the other argues that differences in one or more third variables ( Z ), such as 
time preference, affect both schooling and health in the same direction ( Grossman 
2000 ). Another example is the observed positive correlation between schooling and 
earnings. In this case, the potential third variable is ability, which affects both school-
ing and earning in the same direction. In chapter 16 of this book we discuss another 
similar case, the observed positive correlation between population health and national 
income. In this case, the potential third variables that affect population health and 
national income in the same direction include the quality of social institutions and 
the governing ability of the government. 
 The debates over causation or third-variable hypotheses have important policy 
implications. More specifically, they directly affect the effectiveness of government 
policy to promote a policy such as the legislation on minimum nurse-to-patient ratios, 
if the government accepts the causation hypothesis that an increase in say staffing 
will lead to an increase in health. However, the effectiveness of such a policy will 
decline or even completely vanish if there is no such causal relationship between 
staffing and health. For example, the return on the minimum-nurse-staffing policy 
will be higher if there is a causal relationship between nurse staffing and quality of 
health care. If, however, the third-variable hypothesis is relevant, then increasing the 
level of nurse staffing will not effectively accomplish the goal of improved health 
outcomes. 
Box 8.3
(continued)
 Since hospitals differ in many ways other than nurse staffing, gauging the 
effects of changing levels of staffing at the same hospital is an attractive approach. 
For example,  Bell and Redelmeier (2001)  used data from Canada to compare patient 
outcomes within the same hospitals for patients admitted to hospitals on weekends 
and on weekdays. In practice, the level of nurse staffing in hospitals, even relative 
to the number of patients in the hospital, is often lower on weekends than on 
weekdays. Thus, to the extent that nurse-to-patient ratios affect patient outcomes, 
one would expect that in-hospital mortality rates among patients admitted to hos-
pitals on weekends might be higher than among patients admitted at other times. 
Based on observations from more than three million admissions and controlling 
for other factors (differences in age, sex, and coexisting disorders), the authors 
found that weekend admissions are associated with significantly higher in-hospital 
mortality rates than are weekday admissions among patients with three diseases, 
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, acute epiglottitis, and pulmonary embolism, 

348 
 Part II / Chapter 8
conditions for which outcomes are thought to be relatively responsive to nurse 
staffing levels. 
 However, a weakness of this study is that the types of patients admitted on 
weekends may be more likely to be admitted on an emergency basis even if the 
diagnosis is the same ( Evans and Kim 2006 ). Patients admitted on weekends may 
differ from others in ways not observable to the researcher. Probably the major 
reason that patients are admitted on weekdays rather than on weekends is that 
their physicians prefer a weekday admission. But another reason is that in light of 
reduced staffing on weekends, there is a higher risk to patients should a major 
complication arise. For these reasons, patients admitted to hospitals at different 
times do not make up random samples. Rather, patients are admitted on weekends 
because it is difficult for them to receive adequate care at home — for example, 
patients who experience difficulty breathing. It is possible that the observed dif-
ferences in patient outcomes arising from different timing of hospital admissions 
attributed by researchers to differences in nurse staffing are really attributable to 
differences in illness severity that are not recorded in the data. 
 Recent studies have employed longitudinal data to examine the relationship 
between nurse staffing and the quality of hospital care. The advantage of longitu-
dinal data is that researchers have enough information to control for hospital 
heterogeneity and changes in hospital quality over time. For example, using data 
obtained from 422 hospitals in the United States during 1990 – 1995 and a sophis-
ticated econometric method applied to longitudinal data on these hospitals,  Mark, 
Harless, McCue, et al. (2004)  found that increasing nurse staffing reduces in-hos-
pital mortality. However, the marginal effect of increased nurse staffing on mortal-
ity decreases as the level of nurse staffing rises, indicating there are diminishing 
returns to adding nursing staff. 
 The diminishing marginal effect suggests that adding more professional 
nurses to a less well-staffed facility leads to a greater improvement in quality 
of hospital care than at a well-staffed facility. This finding is confirmed by 
another similar study of the impact of managed care penetration on the relationship 
between nurse staffing and the quality of hospital care ( Mark, Harless, and McCue 
2005 ). But more important, this study found that the relationship between nurse 
staffing and the quality of hospital care depends on the level of managed care 
penetration in the hospital ’ s market area. In markets with a higher penetration of 
managed care, higher nurse staffing is associated with lower mortality. However, 
this relationship does not hold for hospitals in market areas with a lower penetra-
tion of managed care. A plausible explanation for this result is that the expansion 
of managed care forces the hospital to reduce slack resources and hence makes 
the effect of increasing nurse staffing on the mortality rate more readily 
discernible. 
 Although longitudinal studies offer several advantages for controlling for the 
effect of factors not included in the analysis, there is still another methodological 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 349
issue, namely, that hospitals with adverse outcomes may adjust their nurse staffing 
levels in an effort to reduce them. In economic terminology, staffing may be endog-
enous to outcomes at the facility. 
 To deal with feedbacks from outcomes to staffing,  Evans and Kim (2006)  
defined a measure of nurse staffing that should not reflect outcomes at the hospital. 
They took advantage of the fact that the number of nurses present at a hospital on 
a given day tends to be determined one or two weeks in advance. Thus, on a given 
day, the nurse-to-patient ratio is influenced only by the patient census at the hos-
pital. Richness of staffing at any given point in time fluctuates with the number of 
hospital admissions, which is generally beyond the control of the hospitals. With 
a fixed staffing level, the effective staffing level decreases as the number of hospital 
admissions increases, and vice versa. Other things being equal, an unanticipated 
increase in hospital admissions may reduce the nurse-to-patient ratio below the 
ratio desired by the hospital. The authors used these unanticipated fluctuations in 
staffing to identify a relationship between staffing and outcomes. 
 Based on a census of hospital discharges from the US state of California over 
the 1996 – 2000 period,  Evans and Kim (2006)  estimated the impact of effective 
hospital staffing levels on patient outcomes, measured by length of stay, in-hospital 
mortality, and hospital readmission rates. Although the patterns in their data dis-
played considerable day-to-day variation in staff-to-patient ratios, they did not 
generally find a statistically significant impact of staffing on outcome. Thus, a 
person who happens to be admitted to the hospital on a busy day should not have 
a special concern about the care he or she will receive. 
 Public Policy Responses 
 The potential impact of nurse-to-patient ratios on quality of hospital care com-
mands more than academic interest. In the United States, evidence indicating that 
nursing staffing affects the quality of hospital care has been cited in policy debates 
about whether government should enact a law to require that hospitals maintain 
minimum ratios of nurses to patients. In 1999, California enacted a law regulating 
minimum nurse-to-patient ratios for its hospitals, which went into effect in January 
2004. The minimum nurse-to-patient ratios set by government regulation range 
from one to one in surgery operating rooms to one to eight in newborn nurseries 
( Evans and Kim 2006 ). Similar regulation has been imposed on hospitals by the 
state of Victoria, Australia ( OECD 2004 ). 
 Although governments ’ role in requiring minimum nurse-to-patient ratios has 
been motivated by the goal of improving patient outcomes, there are costs and 
benefits of such mandates. On the cost side, the major impact of mandatory 
minimum staffing ratios is that hospitals below the minimum levels face an increase 
in their wage bills. The cost impact is likely to be especially large in areas in which 
nurse labor markets are tight. Especially in such situations, a substantial increase 
in wages may be needed to induce sufficient increases in nurse labor supply, given 

350 
 Part II / Chapter 8
the above-mentioned evidence that nurses are very unresponsive to wage changes. 
One study estimates that hospitals in California would incur US$400 million annu-
ally to achieve the legislated minimum nurse-to-patient ratios ( Evans and Kim 
2006 ). 
 A recent study found evidence that the minimum-nursing-staff legislation 
raises the wages of nurses in California ( Mark, Harless, and Spetz 2009 ). Compared 
to nurses employed in metropolitan areas outside California, this study found that 
nurses in California metropolitan areas experienced a higher growth rate in real 
wages by more than 12 percent during the period 2000 – 2006. 
 Furthermore, regulation of minimum nurse-to-patient ratios restricts the sub-
stitution of health care inputs in the production of hospital care, which in turn 
may have an adverse impact on hospital productivity. The implicit assumption 
behind the regulation is that only additional nurses can improve patient outcomes, 
but hospitals employ many types of personnel that also may be productive in this 
respect. 
 In   figure 8.7 , hospitals could employ two types of labor inputs to produce a 
given quantity of output: (1) nurses and (2) other personnel. The line  EN represents 
the isocost line, indicating that hospitals can employ different combinations of 
nurses and other personnel with a given budget. The curves  x 2 and  x 1 represent

isoquants, indicating that hospitals can produce the same output with different 
combinations of two labor inputs.  
 The optimal input mix of personnel is at point  A , given factor prices of the 
two inputs.  “ Optimal ” means that the hospital can produce a given output (in this 
case,  x 2 ) with a minimum cost. At this optimal choice (point  A ), the hospital 
employs nurses by  N 1 and other personnel by  E 1 . 
 However, the minimum-staffing regulation requires that the hospital employ 
nurses at  N 2 , which in turn forces the hospital to operate at point  C under a given 
budget. At point  C , the hospital cannot produce as much output for a given wage 
bill (the isocost curve). In this sense, the law introduces inefficiency in the alloca-
tion of resources. This suggests that there is an opportunity cost of regulation that 
discourages innovation in the development of other types of health professionals 
by hospitals. In addition, the minimum-staffing regulation restricts innovation in 
the amounts and combinations of input use, such as labor and capital. 
 The analysis does not end here. On the benefit side, there are two potential 
effects of the legislated minimum nurse-to-patient ratios. First, patients may benefit 
from a better quality of hospital care. But the existing literature has produced 
no consensus on the magnitude of effect of nurse staffing levels on patient out-
comes. Studies published in medical journals (e.g.,  Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, et al. 
2002 ) have concluded that increased staffing improves quality of care, while 
some economic research reaches the opposite conclusion ( Evans and Kim 2006 ), 
namely that increases in staffing have no statistically significant effect on patient 
outcomes. 
 Second, richer staffing reduces the workload per nurse, thus increasing 
nurses ’ job satisfaction ( Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, et al. 2002 ) by, for example, decreas-
ing  “ burnout ”  (emotional exhaustion due to job stress) and decreasing quit rates 
( Shields and Ward 2001 ). Nurse staffing in hospitals generally is subject to high 
turnover rates ( Frijters, Shields, and Price 2007 ). A reduction in nurse turnover 
arising from the mandating legislation on minimum nurse-to-patient ratios may 
provide a benefit to hospitals in this regard, that is, savings from reducing the 
administrative burdens and job training. However, whether or not cost savings 
arising from reduced nursing staff turnover are sufficiently large to compensate for 
the increased costs of higher staffing levels is unclear. If the benefits of increasing 
nurse staffing to hospitals are high, there is a question about why there is not higher 
staffing absent these laws. 
 Of course, whatever the overall benefits and costs, benefits and costs are 
borne by different parties. Nurses clearly benefit from increased demand for their 
services. To the extent that patient care is improved, patients benefit, particularly 
if the cost of the improvement is borne by others. The costs of such legislation are 
mainly borne by insurance premium payers and taxpayers, and perhaps by hospi-
tals in terms of direct costs of hospital personnel and costs of efficiency loss — costs 
not forward-shiftable to others. In the end, it is the  “ owners ” (perhaps ill-defined; 

352 
 Part II / Chapter 8
see chapter 6) who are the residual claimants and ultimately bear the burden of 
the added cost that cannot be shifted. As was discussed in chapter 6, identifying 
who the residual claimants are is difficult in this context. 
 8.6 
 Nurses in the Production of Nursing Home 
Services 
 Overview 
 In the health field, a distinction is made between acute care and long-term care. 
By  acute care , insiders in the field mean hospital and physician services, even 
though many, if not most, of such services are provided to individuals with chronic 
conditions on an ongoing basis. But any single spell of illness is typically only of 
short duration. 
 By contrast,  long-term care  refers to care delivered over a long time horizon. 
For example, while a person may be in a hospital for a week for a hip replacement, 
the person might be in a nursing facility for rehabilitation and later for residential 
care for months and even years. 
 Long-term care includes care in nursing homes, home health visits (care 
provided in the home by health care professionals), hospice care (care provided 
for terminally ill patients in a variety of settings), and  “ informal ”  care provided by 
families on an unpaid basis. By far the largest component of paid long-term care 
is nursing home care. Thus, we limit our discussion of long-term care to nursing 
homes. 
 Nursing homes (residential care facilities) are major employers of nurses, 
professional nurses, and in even greater numbers nursing personnel with substan-
tially less educational preparation than professional nurses receive. For various 
reasons, including population aging, the demand for long-term residential care is 
increasing rapidly around the world, especially in high-income countries. Many 
elderly enter a nursing home when they are no longer able to live independently. 
In high-income countries, nursing home residents account for 5 – 10 percent of the 
population aged 65 and older. From a lifetime perspective, a man who reaches age 
65 and lives in the United States has a one in three chance of being admitted to a 
nursing home prior to death. For women, this probability exceeds 50 percent 
( Norton 2000 ). 
 Nursing homes provide long-term care using a mix of professional nursing 
staff and nonprofessional staff. Nursing staff includes professional nurses, also 
called registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and nurses ’ aides 
(NAs), who provide most direct care to patients, such as helping residents with 
activities of daily living, including eating, dressing, bathing, toileting, and walking. 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 353
RNs usually provide in-house training for the nursing aide staff. They also deal 
with medical emergencies, sometimes until a physician can be consulted. 
 In the United States in 1987, on average, there were 51.2 full-time-equivalent 
nursing staff per 100 residents in nursing homes. By type of nurse, there were 5.6 
RNs and 9.4 LPNs, with the rest (70 percent) being NAs ( Cohen and Spector 1996 ). 
 These categories of nurses differ appreciably in terms of education and train-
ing and are imperfect substitutes for each other. Thus, both the number of nursing 
staff and the mix at a nursing home may affect the quality of care provided at the 
home. 
 In this section, we examine three important questions concerning nurse staff-
ing and quality of care in nursing homes: (1) What are the major economic factors 
accounting for variation in nurse-to-resident ratios ( “ intensity ” ) and mix of nurse 
staffing in nursing homes? (2) What is the relationship between nurse staffing and 
patient outcomes in nursing homes? (3) What is the rationale for the government 
regulation of staffing levels and mix in nursing homes? For example, an Institute 
of Medicine (part of the US National Academy of Sciences) report recommended 
a minimum standard of 24-hour staffing of nursing homes in the United States 
( Davis, Wunderlich, and Sloan 1996 ). 
 Effects of Economic Factors on Nurse Staffing and Mix 
 In this subsection, we consider three  “ economic ” factors affecting nurse staffing 
levels and mix of staff in nursing homes: ownership type, wage rates, and methods 
of payment for nursing home care. In the United States, these three factors are 
well-studied determinants of nurse staff intensity in nursing homes. 
 Unlike hospitals (see chapter 6), the nursing home market in the United States 
is dominated by for-profit firms. For example, about two-thirds of the nursing 
homes were for-profit in 1995 ( Norton 2000 ). However, as with hospital care, 
nursing home care inputs are  “ noncontractible ” (see chapter 7) in the sense that it 
is nearly impossible to specify the type and level of care provision under all pos-
sible contingencies. Also, the output of nursing home care is difficult to observe 
by nursing home residents because they are often frail and disabled. The health 
and physical function of elderly in such facilities are expected to decline even if 
high-quality care is provided. Thus, the fact that health and function decline with 
time spent in a nursing home cannot necessarily be attributed to the level of care 
a nursing home provides. 
 Particularly because many nursing home residents do not have close relatives 
and friends who visit them very regularly, persons who make the decision to place 
an elderly person in a nursing home may not have good knowledge about how the 
home operates. Thus, because quality is difficult for residents to monitor and often 
there are no relatives and friends to monitor, asymmetric information between the 
nursing home and consumers is likely to exist ( Chou 2002 ). A profit-seeking 

354 
 Part II / Chapter 8
nursing home has an incentive to engage in cost cutting since it reasons that the 
effects of the cost reductions will not be observed by consumers. The incentive to 
cut cost may be weaker for the nonprofit firms because of the nondistribution 
constraint (see chapter 6). 
 For this reason, private nonprofit nursing homes may provide better quality 
of care than for-profit firms when asymmetric information is present. Chou found 
empirical evidence of a statistically significant difference in quality of care between 
for-profit and nonprofit homes when residents had no spouse and no child visiting 
within one month of admission. The difference in quality among ownership forms 
of nursing homes vanished when the residents had family members to monitor the 
quality of care, indicating that for-profit nursing homes are prone to compromise 
services that are difficult to observe. 
 Although Chou ’ s study did not directly examine the relationship between 
ownership of nursing homes and decisions about levels of nursing staffing but 
rather on outcome indicators such as presence of bedsores, her empirical evidence 
suggests that a reason for the difference in outcomes between for-profit and not-
for-profit homes may be differences in nursing staffing patterns. In fact, an earlier 
US study by  Cohen and Spector (1996)  reported that nonprofit homes have lower 
LPN staffing intensity and higher RN staffing compared to for-profit homes, that 
is, a higher skill mix of nursing staff. 
 Given the dominance of for-profit firms in the nursing home market, the deci-
sion on the optimal number and optimal mix of nursing staff is expected to be 
influenced by various incentives, such as the wage level of nursing staff, as well 
as reimbursement used by health insurers and the level of reimbursement. In the 
short run, with capital fixed, a profit-maximizing home chooses the cost-minimiz-
ing combination of labor and materials (e.g., restraints on the residents to keep 
them from wandering or drugs to induce them to sleep) to produce a given amount 
of nursing home care. Nursing homes can choose either labor-intensive or materi-
als-intensive methods to produce long-term care. Substitution between inputs 
depends on relative input prices. 
 Profit-seeking nursing firms more frequently adopt a materials-intensive 
method in markets in which wages of nursing staff are relatively high. Even if such 
nursing homes had price-setting power, they would have an incentive to minimize 
cost (see, e.g.,  Cawley, Grabowski, and Hirth 2006 ). However, a second factor rein-
forces such behavior. In the vast majority of high-income countries, including the 
United States, the government is the primary payer for nursing home care, and for 
such care, the government, not the nursing home, is the price setter.  5 A low and 
fixed output price places extra pressure on nursing homes to adopt input substitu-
tion in response to rising wages. 
 There are many examples of input substitution in nursing home care. For 
example, incontinence can be managed by a labor-intensive approach, including 
regularly scheduled toileting and bladder rehabilitation, or by a materials-intensive 
5.  For example, in the 
United States, through 
Medicaid and 
Medicare, the public 
sector paid 64 percent 
of total expenditures 
spent on nursing home 
care in 2002 ( Kumar, 
Norton, and Encinosa 
2006 ).

approach through urethral catheterization. Similarly, monitoring and controlling 
residents ’  behavior can be managed by a labor-intensive approach, such as personal 
monitoring, or by a materials-intensive approach, such as administering psychoac-
tive drugs. A reliance on materials-intensive inputs can increase the risk of morbid-
ity and mortality ( Cawley, Grabowski, and Hirth 2006 ). 6 
 Although most governments have adopted fixed-priced systems in recent 
years, previously, many used cost-based reimbursement. To the extent that nursing 
homes were paid on the basis of the costs they incurred, it should come as no 
surprise that cost-based reimbursement gave nursing homes an incentive to boost 
input use, including specifically nurse staffing. A study published in the 1990s 
reported empirical evidence consistent with this ( Cohen and Spector 1996 ). 
 Effects of Nurse Staffing Levels and Mix on Patient Outcomes 
 Research on the topic of the relationship between input levels and mix on patient 
outcomes in nursing homes predates similar research in a hospital setting ( Davis, 
Wunderlich, and Sloan 1996 ). Compared to hospitals, the nursing home production 
function is much less complex, and nurses are more dominant. This simplifies the 
task of assessing nurses ’ contribution to quality care in nursing home settings. 
 We review two recent studies on this subject here.  Schnelle, Simmons, Har-
rington, et al. (2004)  compared quality of care at nursing homes with high versus 
low staffing levels and found that highest-staffed nursing homes provided better 
quality of care on thirteen of sixteen care processes.  “ Care process ” refers to types 
of services provided to patients, especially under certain circumstances — for 
example, for patients who cannot move and are bedridden, the procedures to 
prevent bedsores. However, as with hospitals (although to a lesser extent), factors 
other than nurse staffing may affect care processes, and some of these factors may 
be systematically related to nurse staffing and mix. 
 In the second study, using data from 658 nursing homes and 2,663 residents 
of these homes in the United States,  Cohen and Spector (1996)  found that higher 
staffing improved patient outcomes, measured by mortality. Their results imply 
that a 10 percent increase in the RN-to-patient ratio decreases mortality by 1 
percent. They reported no statistically significant effect of RN staffing intensity on 
the functional status of patients. 7 
 Implications for Public Policy 
 As in hospital care, the evidence on the positive relationship between the intensity 
of nursing staff and the quality of long-term care has given rise to a policy debate 
about the need to impose minimum staffing laws on nursing home. The rationale 
for government regulation of this industry stems in part from the fact that govern-
ment is the major payer of long-term care. In addition, the presence of asymmetric 
information between nursing homes and their residents provides an incentive that 
for-profit homes take advantage of their residents to make a profit. This provides 
6.  Using longitudinal 
data from 1991 to 2000 
on nearly every nursing 
home in the United 
States, the authors 
em pirically assessed 
the impact of increases 
in local wages for 
nursing home workers 
on nurs ing staff 
intensity, materials 
intensity, and the 
quality of care in 
nursing homes. They 
found that higher 
wages led to a lower 
intensity of nurs ing 
staff for both nurses ’ 
aides and professional 
nurses. However, the 
re sults are not 
statistically significant. 
A plausible explanation 
for this result is that 
the existence of a 
minimum staffing 
requirement im posed 
by government 
regulation limits 
nurs ing home responses 
to wage changes. 
Although higher wages 
did not affect nursing 
staff intensity, the 
authors found that 
higher wages did lead 
to increasingly 
materials-intensive care 
provision. Specifically, 
they found that an 
increase of 10 percent 
in wages for nursing 
home workers yielded a 
2.63 percent increase in 
the share of residents 
who were on 
psychoactive drugs. 
Furthermore, higher 
wages were associated 
with lower quality of 
nursing home care, as 
measured by the 
percentage of residents 
with bowel and bladder 
incontinence as well as 
bedfast. They reported 
that a 10 percent

a rationale for government regulation through which minimum quality standards 
serve a role in protecting consumers. 
 While the policy content of government regulation of nursing homes varies 
among countries, the major focus of such regulation is on residents ’ safety and 
health outcomes. For example, in the United States, Congress passed the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) in 1987 (effective October 1990) to regulate the 
quality of care in the nursing home industry. OBRA contains: (1) minimum quality 
standards, (2) a survey and inspection process, and (3) an enforcement system. The 
minimum quality standards require all nursing homes to have at least eight hours 
of RN coverage per day and LPN coverage 24 hours a day. OBRA introduced stan-
dard enforcement procedures and severe penalties to deter nursing homes from 
violating these minimum quality standards ( Kumar, Norton, and Encinosa 2006 ). 
 Using data from the National Long-Term Care Survey, a household survey of 
US elderly persons,  Kumar, Norton, and Encinosa (2006) examined the impact of 
OBRA on the quality of nursing home care as measured by residents ’ outcomes. 
The results indicate that the overall effect of government regulation depends on 
the nursing home ’ s profitability, as proxied by the size of nursing home. 
 Kumar and colleagues reported that regulation decreases quality in less profit-
able (smaller) nursing homes. But the effect of government regulation on quality 
of care is positive in the more profitable (larger) nursing homes. The reason why 
larger nursing homes tend to be more profitable is that they can take advantage of 
economies of scale. Even a small nursing home needs to maintain certain admin-
istrative staff. For small homes, moreover, quality regulation forces homes to shift 
resources from unregulated areas to those areas subject to regulation. This may 
result in a decrease in overall quality, considering both dimensions monitored by 
regulation as well as some that are not. 
 In addition, the results show that the effect of regulation was higher during 
the transition period (from March 31, 1990, to April 1, 1991) than during the post-
transition period (from April 1, 1991, to April 1, 1993). Initially, nursing homes 
may have expected that the government would enforce its regulations. Later, it 
became apparent that some of the regulations would not be enforced. 
 Overall, the empirical evidence reported by  Kumar, Norton, and Encinosa 
(2006)  has two important policy implications for government regulation of minimum 
quality standards in the nursing home industry. First, the extent to which nursing 
homes comply with the regulation requirements depends on their size. Small 
nursing homes may face tighter financial constraints and be unable to adjust their 
nursing staff according to the minimum quality standards. Second, the effects of 
government regulation depend on whether the threat of law enforcement is cred-
ible. During the early period after the regulation became effective, the perceived 
threat for not complying with the regulatory requirements may have provided an 
incentive for providers to increase quality of care. However, nursing homes subse-
quently learned that the threat of law enforcement is not credible. 
in crease in wages was 
associated with a 
3.2 – 3.6 percent increase 
in the share of residents 
who were incontinent 
and an 8.6 percent 
increase in the share of 
residents who were 
bedfast.
7.  Earlier evidence on 
the effects of RN 
staffing in nursing 
homes on outcomes led 
an Institute of Medicine 
committee to conclude 
that higher RN staffing 
in nursing homes does 
improve outcomes. 
How ever, evidence 
published subsequently 
is mixed, giving reason 
for more caution about 
the relationship (see 
 Davis, Wunderlich, and 
Sloan 1996 ). This 
Institute of Medicine 
study concluded that 
there is weaker support 
for a relationship in 
hospitals than in 
nursing homes.

 Summary and Conclusions 
 In this chapter, we have investigated several important issues in labor markets for 
nurses and the role of nursing staff in the production of hospital and nursing home 
care. These are our major findings. 
 First, overall, the empirical literature indicates that nurse labor supply is 
quite unresponsive to wage changes. The most precise estimates of wage elasticity 
for the nurse labor supply range between 0.1 and 0.2, suggesting that (1) the nurse 
labor supply curve is upward sloping, (2) if other conditions hold, hospitals have 
substantial market power to set wages for nurses, and (3) if other conditions hold, 
the alleged nurse shortage is just that — it is alleged, not real. 
 Second, in many high-income countries, there is widespread concern that the 
supply of nurses is inadequate. A persistent shortfall in nurse supply may also be 
an effect of public regulation 
 Given the preconditions that must be satisfied for monopsony to exist, it 
seems unlikely that the model is appropriate in large cities unless one can dem-
onstrate that some collusive arrangement exists. For this reason, it is not surprising 
that there is no strong empirical evidence supporting monopsony in markets for 
nurses. The low responsiveness of supply to wages is a necessary but not a suffi-
cient condition for monopsony to exist. A more compelling explanation for persis-
tent excess demand for nurses is the continuing outward shifts in demand, coupled 
with lags in the supply response. 
 Third, given the importance of nursing staff in the production of hospital and 
nursing home care, quite a number of studies, diverse methodologically and in 
terms of the data used, have addressed the question of whether higher nurse-to-
patient ratios improve quality of care. Overall, the evidence is mixed, with some 
cross-sectional and within-hospital studies lending empirical support for a rela-
tionship but other studies, based on longitudinal data and using more advanced 
econometric techniques to control for various biases, finding at most limited empir-
ical support for a  causal  link between nurse staffing and quality. 
 Finally, arguments that there is a relationship between nurse-to-patient ratios 
and quality of care, with some empirical support, especially from studies published 
in medical journals, have raised policy concerns about whether public intervention 
in the form of minimum staffing laws is needed. If such laws can be justified at 
all, they may make more sense for nursing homes than for hospitals. However, even 
here there is no clear empirical evidence to support public regulation of quality. 
For nursing homes, the problem may be that governments have budgeted too little 
for enforcement. Thus, in reality, even with laws on the books, nursing homes that 
do not comply with the mandated standards may be able to continue this practice 
without threats of meaningful sanctions. Lack of regulation is not only a matter of 
inadequate resources for enforcement. In addition, regulatory agencies face a 

358 
 Part II / Chapter 8
dilemma. If they are too tough on the firms they regulate, this may cause some to 
exit, which in turn would lead to access barriers for elderly and disabled persons 
to nursing home care.

conditions that lead to a persistent nursing shortage? 
 8.4 
 What is a monopsony? Under what circumstances is a monopsony likely to 
arise? What is the empirical evidence that hospitals possess monopsony 
power in the market for professional nurses (including empirical tests of the 
monopsony hypothesis)? If hospitals possess such power, what are the 
implications for public policy?

 8.6  
 What practical difference does it make if nursing is viewed as a vocation 
rather than as a profession? If nursing is primarily viewed as a vocation, is 
increasing the nurses ’ wage likely to be an effective policy to ease a nurse 
shortage? Under such circumstances, what are the potential impacts of such 
policy on the quality of care? How would your policies as an employer differ 
if nursing is widely viewed as a profession? 
 8.7  
 What are the extensive and intensive margins in the nurse labor supply? 
Conceptually, would you expect that the extensive margin in the nurse labor 
supply is more responsive to wage change in modern society (such as in the 
2000s) than in a more traditional society in which women are viewed as 
 “ secondary ”  workers in families (such as in the 1950s)? Explain your answer. 
 8.8  
 What is the substitution effect of a wage increase? What is the income effect? 
What does the labor supply curve looks like if the income effect exceeds the 
substitution effect? For which of the following occupations is it more likely 
that the income effect of a wage change exceeds the substitution effect?

and not-for-profit nursing homes? Which type of nursing home would 
provide better quality of care to residents? Why?

to-patient ratios for hospitals? Who pays the costs and who receives the 
benefits of such regulation? 
 8.11  
 What is the economic rationale of government regulation of minimum nurse 
staffing for hospitals and nursing homes? Do you agree that such regulation 
is more justifiable for nursing homes than for hospitals? Why or why not? 
 Exercises 
 8.1   The Good Works General Hospital has a local monopoly in the sale of hospital 
services in its market area. Its product demand curve is  p = 30  – 0.4 x , where  p is 

360 
 Part II / Chapter 8
the price of a hospital day and  x is the number of hospital days per year at Good 
Works. Given this demand curve, derive the equation for marginal revenue (MR). 
 Good Works is the only employer of professional nurses in its market area. It faces 
a supply of nurse labor of  w = 5 + 0.9 E , where  w is the nurse hourly wage and  E 
is the full-time-equivalent of nurses employed by Good Works. What is the mar-
ginal factor cost of nurse labor? Assume each nurse can monitor four patient rooms 
per hour (with one patient per room) and Good Works is a profit maximizer. Then 
how many professional nurses should Good Works employ? At what hourly wage? 
What price should Good Works charge for a hospital day? 
 8.2 
 a.  Suppose that the supply function changed to  w = 10 + 0.9 E . What would be the 
new values of the hourly wage, the product price, and nurse employment? 
 b.  Assuming the original supply function of nurses, what would be the new values 
of the hourly wage, the product price, and nurse employment if nurses were 
able to monitor only two rooms per hour? 
 8.3  Consider the community (city or town) in which you live. Are local hospitals 
likely to be monopsonists? Why or why not? 
 8.4  For which of the following occupations is Good Works General Hospital likely 
to possess monopsony power? Discuss each occupation and justify your answers. 
 
  Receptionist 
 
  Hospital administrator 
 
  X-ray technician 
 
  Professional nurse 
 
  Nurses ’  aide 
 What do you think are the three most important nonwage determinants of nurse 
labor supply? Justify each answer. For each, how is the supply of nurse labor curve 
expected to change for a given change in the nonwage attribute? 
 8.5  Following the concept of full price in exercise 11 of chapter 3, let  Y represent 
full income, where  Y = wage income + nonwage income. 
 a.  Would you expect the elasticity of labor supply with respect to wage to be higher 
or lower for a nurse with a higher share of nonwage income than for a nurse 
with a lower share of nonwage income? Explain your answer. 
 b.  Based on your answer to (a), would you expect the elasticity of labor supply 
with respect to wage to be higher or lower for a  “ female profession ” (such as 

Nurses in Hospital and Long-Term Care Service 
 361
nursing) compared to a  “ male profession ” (such as pilot), other things being 
equal? Explain your answer. 
 8.6   Suppose  H = 0.5 w  – 5 is Mary ’ s labor supply curve, where  H is hours of work 
per week and  w is the wage rate per hour. What is the  “ reservation wage ” for Mary 
that she would like to go to work (participate in the labor market)? What is the 
wage elasticity of labor supply at  w = 100? Would Mary like to spend more hours 
on work if the wage rate increased to 150 per hour? Can you explain why? 
 8.7   Suppose the aggregate demand curve for a nurse in an island city is  N d = 
300  – 5 w , where  w is the hourly wage rate for nurses and  N d is the number of nurses 
demanded in this city. The supply of nurses is  N s = 5 w  – 100, where  N s is number 
of nurses supplied to market. In addition, the city government publicly announces 
that the city needs to hire 125 nurses in order to provide good-quality hospital care 
to its citizens. Meanwhile, the city government regulates the wage rate for nurses 
at  w = 30. 
 Answer the following questions: 
 a.  Use both economic and need-based approaches to calculate the nursing shortage 
under the current regulated wage rate. Do these two approaches yield the same 
estimates on the number of nursing shortage? 
 b.  If the city government decides to recruit nurses from overseas and this policy 
shifts the supply of nurse to  N s  ′  = 5 w  – 50, does this policy solve the problem 
of nursing shortage or just mitigate the extent of nursing shortage? Does your 
answer differ according to different definitions of  “ shortage ” ? Explain your 
answer. 
 c.  If the city government further announces raising the wage rate for nurses from 
30 to 40 and the policy that allows recruiting nurses from overseas remains 
valid, does the city government solve the problem of nursing shortage or create 
a new problem? Does your answer differ according to different definitions of 
 “ shortage ” ? Explain your answer. 
 8.8   Suppose a for-profit nursing home can produce long-term care services 
( x ) using two inputs: labor (such as nurses,  l ) and material (such as psychoactive 
drugs,  M ). Thus, the production function of the nursing home can be described 
as  x =  f ( l ,  M ). In addition,  w represents the market price of labor input (wage) 
and  p represents the market price of material inputs. Thus, the cost function 
of the nursing home can be described by  C =  w  ×  l +  p  ×  M . Answer the 
following questions: 
 a.  Use a graph to explain how the nursing home decides the optimal uses of labor 
and material inputs. 

362 
 Part II / Chapter 8
 b.  Suppose the government imposes a regulation on minimum nursing staffing 
and this minimum nursing staffing level exceeds the level the nursing home 
decides is optimal. Use a graph to explain the effect of government regulation 
on the nursing home ’ s input choices. Does regulation increase the cost of nursing 
home care if the nursing home wants to keep its output constant? What other 
choices can the nursing home make if the nursing home wants to keep cost 
constant in response to the government regulation? Consider another case in 
which the government does not impose any regulation on nursing home input 
use but the market wage of nurses increases substantially owing to an unantici-
pated policy shock, such as a government requirement that employers provide 
health insurance coverage to employees. Use a graph to explain the effect of the 
higher wage on the optimal use of inputs by the nursing home, and discuss the 
potential consequences of such a change on the mix of inputs and on the quality 
of nursing home care provided.

 Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers, profit-maximizing firms with long time horizons, 
decide on investments in new products. Among these new products, prescrip-
tion drugs are of particular interest since they are major inputs in the produc-
tion of good health. In addition, new prescription drugs are a major source of 
advances in health care technologies, which in turn often result in extending 
the capability of medicine to prevent and treat diseases and improve the quality 
of life. Once products are developed, there are issues of pricing and product 
promotion in countries in which the products become available. Some manu-
facturers concentrate on producing generics, which are chemically equivalent 
to branded products but are only sold after the patent on the branded drug 
expires. A patent gives the branded product a monopoly status until the patent 
expires. 
 This chapter focuses on the microeconomic decisions of pharmaceutical 
firms, including research and development (R & D) investment, pricing new prod-
ucts, competition between branded and generic products, advertising, and interna-
tional pricing. The firms ’ strategies reflect the actual and anticipated decisions of 
rivals and of governments. 
 Governments make decisions about drug approval, drug formularies, and 
patent protection. Unlike the vast majority of goods and services, pharmaceuticals 
are subject to entry regulation, similar in a sense to certificate of need regulation 
of hospitals described in chapter 6 in that government approval is needed before 
a drug can be marketed. Having a patent affects the entry of competitors, but does 
not give a firm the right to sell the patented product. Drug formularies are lists of 
drugs that are covered by a public or a private insurance plan. Exclusion from a 

368 
 Part II / Chapter 9
formulary may mean that use of the drug is not subsidized at all or is only partially 
subsidized by the insurance plan. 
 When a drug is not covered by a patent, competitors are free to enter the 
market for the product. Price competition is likely to result in an appreciable reduc-
tion in profit from the sale of the drug. As a result of these public policy decisions 
and others, the market may not provide a sufficient incentive to elicit company 
investment in the R & D needed to develop a new pharmaceutical product. Market 
size may be insufficient for various reasons. For example, the diseases treated by 
the product may be rare, or the diseases may be highly prevalent in low-income 
countries but the ability or willingness to pay for the product is insufficient, or 
there may be important health and financial externalities not captured by the indi-
vidual user of the drug and government intervention to take account of these 
externalities in use is lacking. We also discuss various policies to encourage phar-
maceutical innovation when the market alone provides an inadequate incentive 
for pharmaceutical R & D. 
 9.1 
 Companies ’ Decisions about Investments in R & D 
 Basic Facts of the Pharmaceutical R & D Process 
 The pharmaceutical R & D process consists of two distinct stages, discovery and 
development. The discovery stage includes basic science research and the applica-
tion of  “ upstream ” basic research to search for new compounds with which to 
develop new drugs. The development stage refers to  “ downstream ”  market-ori-
ented R & D, including preclinical testing and three phases of clinical trials to dem-
onstrate the safety and efficacy of the specific compound. Safety criteria are met if 
the probability of an adverse health effect from taking the drug is below some 
minimum threshold. Efficacy means that the drug generally works to produce the 
health outcome the manufacturer states that it does. 
 The drug development process is lengthy, risky, and costly   (table 9.1 ). On 
average, the three phases of clinical testing of a new drug take about six years in 
total. Following clinical testing, a New Drug Application (NDA) is submitted to the 
regulatory agency. In the United States, the mean time required for a decision to 
be reached on an NDA is about two years. In addition, the discovery stage also 
takes about six years. Adding all these steps together, the total amount of time 
required for developing new pharmaceutical products, from basic research to 
approval to market launch, is about 14 years on average in the United States.  
 Since there are many regulatory hurdles in the R & D process, many trials fail 
to pass these hurdles and hence can be abandoned at any time. As a result, there 
are higher failure rates in the drug discovery and development process than in 
developing products in many other sectors. For example, only 40 percent of drugs 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 369
for which an Investigational New Drug Application (INDA) is filed progress to 
Phase I testing and only 75 percent of drugs for which a first phase of clinical test 
is initiated progress to Phase II testing (  table 9.1 ). Combining the conditional prob-
abilities of success (at the probability of success at a stage, given success in the 
prior stage) at each stage together, the overall probability of success, which refers 
the unconditional probability of reaching a given stage, is extremely low. Only 8 
percent of drugs for which an INDA is filed eventually receive approval from the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing. 
 The cost of R & D in the pharmaceutical industry reflects the high cost of drug 
discovery and development while the drug is under development, the lengthy time 
period generally required to develop a new pharmaceutical product, and the low 
probability that a specific attempt to develop a particular drug will actually result 
in a marketable product ( Danzon, Nicholson, and Pereira 2005 ). The mean out-of-
pocket R & D cost to a pharmaceutical manufacturer for Phase I to III trials in the 
1990s ranged from $15.2 to $86.3 million (in 2000 US dollars) (  table 9.1 ). Pharma-
ceutical R & D takes on average 12 to 15 years to successfully develop a new drug. 
For a considerable time period, the pharmaceutical company incurs investment

cost without receiving any revenue from the sale of the drug. There is an  “ oppor-
tunity cost ” to R & D funds tied up over such a lengthy time horizon. 
 The Optimal Investment Decision from a Pharmaceutical 
Company ’ s Vantage Point 
 Given that pharmaceutical R & D is a complicated, lengthy, and risky process, firms 
face a two-step decision process. In the first step, the firm decides whether or not to 
devote resources to a specific R & D project. In the second step, the firm decides on 
the optimal price at which to sell the newly invented good. This price determines 
the profit flow at each date and hence the rate of return on the investment. 
 The problem is solved by backward induction. First, the optimal price is 
derived under the assumption that the R & D investment has already taken place. 
Optimal pricing in part reflects a government ’ s patent policies. Second, results 
from the first stage are used in calculating whether or not the investment should 
be undertaken, which is based on a comparison of  anticipated  marginal returns 
and the marginal cost of capital. Firms expend the resources if the marginal return 
is greater than or equal to the marginal cost of capital, and reject the project 
otherwise. 
 Marginal returns can be represented by a marginal efficiency of investment 
(MEI) schedule. The MEI schedule shows projects ranked by their internal rates of 
return (see chapter 5).  1 The ranking is in decreasing order of projects ’ internal rates 
of return (  fig. 9.1 ). The MEI declines as the firm invests more in a given period

1.  In chapter 2, we 
des cribe the marginal 
efficiency of capital 
(MEC) and here the 
marginal efficiency of 
investment. With the 
MEC, capital is on the 
horizontal axis. With 
the MEI, invest ment is 
on this axis. As 
discussed in chapter 2, 
investment is a flow 
while capital is a stock. 
Net investment is the 
difference between gross 
investment and 
de preciation. 
Depreciation equals the 
capital stock times the 
depreciation rate. In 
chapter 2, we depict 
human health as a 
capital stock. This

since projects are undertaken in decreasing order of their anticipated rates of 
return, starting with the project with the highest rate of return. The shape and 
position of the MEI curve reflects demand curves for final products as well as the 
marginal cost of manufacturing, packaging, and distributing the products once the 
investments have been completed.  
 The marginal cost of capital (COC) schedule shows the marginal cost of 
capital as investment activity expands in any period. The COC can have a zero or 
a positive slope. A positive slope indicates that the firm must pay a higher price 
for capital if it invests more. For simplicity, the COC curve is shown with a zero 
slope in   figure 9.1 , which is appropriate if the COC does not vary with the amount 
the firm invests. The position of the COC curve depends in part on creditors ’ 
assessments of the risk that the creditors will receive payment for principal and 
interest, that is, the borrower ’ s bankruptcy risk, as well as conditions in the capital 
markets more generally. 
 Optimal R & D investment by a pharmaceutical company is shown where the 
MEI and COC curves intersect, at point  E , and the amount of investment chosen 
by the firm is  I *. Here, anticipated marginal returns from investment in R & D, as 
reflected in the internal rate of return, and the marginal cost of funds for such 
investment are equal; at this level of investment, the firm achieves the maximum 
expected profit from its R & D investment. 
 Incentives for Pharmaceutical Innovation 
 Based on the above framework (illustrated in   fig. 9.1 ), we further assess the effects 
of specific government policies or exogenous factors affecting incentives for phar-
maceutical innovation. In this section, we analyze three types of incentives that 
aim to promote investment in pharmaceutical R & D: (1) pull incentives, (2) push 
incentives, and (3) combinations of pull and push incentives. 
 Pull Incentives 
 Pull incentives affect demand for the final product resulting from the invest-
ment in R & D and hence shift the MEI curve outward. Other factors being
equal, the new MEI curve (MEI ′ ) intersects the COC curve at point  E 1 (  fig. 9.2 ); 
the firm ’ s optimal R & D investment now becomes  I d . The increase in R & D invest-
ment, as measured by the difference between  I d and  I *, represents the amount 
of new R & D investment induced by an exogenous change that shifts the MEI 
curve outward. Such shifts occur, for example, in response to an increase in 
market size, reflecting in part governments ’ decisions to cover the new product 
under their public insurance systems, coverage decisions by private insurers, 
and an increase in the willingness of such insurers to pay a higher price for 
the new product than it previously did. The MEI shifts for other reasons as 
well, such as increases in population size, increases in the number of types of 
persons especially likely to use the new product, as well as growth in personal 

372 
 Part II / Chapter 9
income, which affects individuals ’ willingness (and ability) to pay for the new 
product.  
 Push Incentives 
 Push incentives are designed to reduce the cost of investing in new product devel-
opment. Push incentives can affect the marginal cost of funds to the firm for invest-
ments in R & D. For example, governments could grant pharmaceutical companies 
access to tax-exempt debt, which would reduce the interest rate the companies 
have to pay on their loans. The COC curve then shifts downward to COC ′ if there 
is an exogenous change that leads to a decrease in the user cost of capital for R & D 
investment (  fig. 9.3 ). Other factors being equal, the new COC curve (COC ′ ) inter-
sects the MEI curve at point  E 2, with  I c being the firm ’ s new optimal level of R & D 
investment. The increase in R & D investment, as measured by the difference between 
 I c and  I *, represents the new R & D investment induced by push incentives. Macro-
economic policies affecting market rates of interest also affect the COC. 
 In addition to the effective interest rate subsidy, or more generally, any mon-
etary policy that lowers the real rate of interest, push incentives also include 
government grants for basic research, a more generous depreciation policy, and an 
investment tax credit. These policies affect the cash flow associated with the invest-
ment, which in turn affects the MEI. Thus, a new public program of cash grants,

 Pull Incentives and Pharmaceutical Innovation 
 Several studies have documented the empirical relationship between pull incentives 
and pharmaceutical innovation from various settings. Here we illustrate with two 
examples. First, using data from the United States,  Finkelstein (2004)  investigated 
whether an increase in market size resulting from changes in health policies affects 
R & D investment behavior in the vaccine industry. In 1991, the US Centers for Disease 
Control recommended that all infants be vaccinated against hepatitis B. In 1993, 
Medicare provided insurance coverage for influenza vaccinations administered to its 
beneficiaries. These two policies increased the potential market size for vaccines, 
which in turn, in combination with the adoption of a no-fault compensation system 
for injuries attributable to the use of certain childhood vaccines in 1986, substantially 
increased the expected return from developing new vaccines for infectious diseases. 
By comparing changes in the number of new vaccine clinical trials between treatment 
diseases (affected by the policies) and control diseases (not affected by the policies), 
she found evidence linking the policy changes to rates of innovation in vaccine 
markets. Her estimates indicate that a $1 increase in annual expected market revenue 
from a vaccine leads to a six-cent increase in vaccine R & D investment. 
 Second,  Acemoglu and Linn (2004)  measured changes in market size from demo-
graphic trends in the United States. During a recent 30-year period, demographic 
trends led to a decline in the market for drugs mostly consumed by the young (ages 
0 – 30). By contrast, markets for drugs mostly consumed by the middle-aged increased. 
More specifically, Acemoglu and Linn ’ s measure of potential market size for each 
drug category involved a combination of the number of consumers and their incomes. 
The authors found that the change in potential market size has a significant positive 
impact on pharmaceutical innovation, as measured by the number of new drugs 
entering the US market. A 1 percent increase in potential market size leads to about 
a 4 percent increase in the entry of new drugs, in the form of either new nongeneric 
drugs or new molecular entities.  
although a push policy, would shift the MEI curve outward, as would an increase 
in the patent period or the price of the new product, both pull policies.  
 An example of a push incentive to promote pharmaceutical innovation is 
public investment in basic research. Such research may lead to new insights that 
provide scientific direction for the drug development process that occurs later. A 
characteristic of basic research is its public-good nature. For this reason, private 
firms do not have incentives to invest in such research. Rather, as with the financ-
ing of other public goods, such as national defense, the financing of basic scientific 
research is highly dependent on public funding. 
 Despite its public-good nature, basic research is not free from the firm ’ s 
standpoint ( Gambardella 1995 ). The dissemination of scientific knowledge from 

374 
 Part II / Chapter 9
public to private sectors can be quite costly and time-consuming. Firms must invest 
in knowledge capital so that they can access and absorb basic research findings 
( Cockburn and Henderson 1998 ). The form of investment in knowledge capital 
includes some in-house basic research and maintaining an extensive connection 
between pharmaceutical company scientists and publicly funded researchers 
through collaborative efforts in publishing scientific papers. 
 Cockburn and Henderson found that the number of co-authorships of scien-
tific papers is positively related to a firm ’ s private research productivity as mea-
sured by the number of important patents. Since private research mainly focuses 
on downstream market-oriented R & D for developing new drugs, Cockburn and 
Henderson ’ s empirical results suggest that upstream basic research and down-
stream market-oriented R & D are complements rather than substitutes in the phar-
maceutical R & D process. 
 Specifically, public investment in basic research stimulates companies ’ 
investments in R & D in three ways, by providing (1) fundamental biological and 
chemical knowledge of drugs, (2) medical knowledge for the design of human 
clinical trials required by regulatory agencies as proof of drug safety and efficacy, 
and (3) insights into potential new indications for drugs after they have been 
approved. Based on detailed case histories of the development of twenty-one 
important drugs introduced between 1965 and 1992, Cockburn and Henderson

 Additional R & D Investment from Simultaneous Implementation of Pull and Push Incentives 
found that two-thirds of these drugs were developed with at least some government 
financial support. This evidence suggests that increased public investment in basic 
research decreases the cost of acquiring knowledge capital for pharmaceutical 
innovation, which in turn provides an incentive for increasing spending on down-
stream R & D investment by private enterprises. 
 Combinations of Pull and Push Incentives 
 The relative effectiveness of pull versus push incentives cannot be deduced from 
theory alone but rather must be established by examining the empirical evidence. 
That is, in theory, the effect of push incentives ( I c  –  I * in   fig. 9.3 ) is not necessarily 
less than the effect of pull incentives ( I d  –  I * in   fig. 9.2 ). 
 Kremer and Glennerster (2004 ) argued that pull incentives tend to be more 
promising. With pull incentives, the reward is for results; with push incentives, 
by contrast, the rewards are more frequently based on promises. For example, an 
applicant for a government grant, a push incentive, can make various claims about 
the uniqueness of an approach, but once awarded the grant, there is no direct 
incentive to deliver on the promise except the threat that nonperformance will 
result in fewer grants in the future. Unfortunately, conclusive empirical evidence 
comparing pull versus push incentives is lacking. 
 A combination of pull and push incentives may stimulate more added invest-
ment than when only one type is applied alone (  fig. 9.4 ). For this reason, rather 

376 
 Part II / Chapter 9
than choose between the two, a government may be well advised to include a mix 
of pull and push policies in its pharmaceutical R & D investment stimulus package. 
Depending on the precise mix of policies implemented, this approach could shift 
the MEI curve outward and shift the COC curve downward at the same time, 
leading, for example, to a new optimal investment decision at  E 3, with  I c + d being 
the firm ’ s new optimal R & D investment. In this example, the new R & D investment 
induced by adopting both pull and push incentives simultaneously exceeds the 
new investment induced by pull or push incentives alone.  
 The 1983 US Orphan Drug Act is a well-known example of the use of both 
pull and push incentives by a government to promote pharmaceutical innovation. 
The rationale for the act was to stimulate R & D investment in drugs with relatively 
small potential market sizes (i.e., to treat rare diseases). The act provides a tax 
credit of up to 50 percent of certain clinical testing expenses incurred by pharma-
ceutical firms to generate required data for marketing approval. In addition, the 
act provides seven years of marketing exclusivity, which is a pull incentive 
that increases the expected market revenue from developing drugs to treat rare 
diseases. 
 Following implementation of the Orphan Drug Act, the mean annual number 
of new drugs brought to market for treating rare diseases increased appreciably. 
During the decade prior to enactment of the act, only one orphan product was 
developed by the pharmaceutical industry per year. Between 1983 and 1994, the 
FDA designated about 600 pharmaceuticals as orphan products, which allowed 
firms to obtain tax credits for clinical testing expenses. During the same period, 
the FDA also approved 111 orphan drugs for marketing, which allowed firms to 
obtain the protection of marketing exclusivity for seven years. 
 Disincentives for Pharmaceutical Innovation 
 Certain government policies provide disincentives for pharmaceutical innovation. 
For example, if country ’ s drug coverages and payment policies become more uncer-
tain, firms may add a risk premium in calculating their optimal investment deci-
sions as a consequence. The risk premium adds to the cost of capital; the COC 
curve shifts upward, and hence the intersection of the COC and MEI curves occurs 
at a higher point on the MEI curve, and the firm ’ s optimal R & D investment falls. 
Or the national agency responsible for approving new drug products for sale in a 
country can lengthen or add complexity to its drug approval process. This in turn 
delays the time at which positive cash flow from the new product can be antici-
pated and lowers the expected rate of return on investments in pharmaceutical 
R & D. The probability that a new drug will ever appear on the market is reflected 
in the MEI. If government regulatory agencies become more stringent in approving 
drugs, this too affects private investment in R & D. 
 A widely discussed disincentive for pharmaceutical R & D is price regulation. 
By definition, price regulation means that the government sets a regulated price 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 377
below the market price that firms would set in the absence of such regulation. By 
reducing prices of regulated products, such regulation decreases firms ’ expected 
returns from R & D investments; in other words, it shifts the MEI curve inward, 
which in turn decreases the pharmaceutical firm ’ s optimal R & D investment. Fur-
thermore, the decrease in returns from investing in R & D decreases the firm ’ s profit 
margin, thereby reducing the internal funds available to the firm for investments 
of all types. 
 The cost of capital from internal funds may be lower than that from external 
funds, such as debt and equity (the latter from issuing new stock in the company). 
To the extent that this is so, public policies that have the effect of reducing firm 
profitability can reduce retained earnings and lower investments in R & D. 
 When the cost of internal funds is lower than the cost of external funds, the 
slope of the COC is positive. Showing this in the framework of   figure 9.1  
would require that we draw the COC with a positive slope. Price regulation would 
then shift the COC curve upward and to the left, leading firms to invest less in 
R & D than before price constraints were imposed. Combining these two effects, 
it is apparent that price regulation provides a disincentive for pharmaceutical 
innovation. 
 Several studies have documented an empirical relationship between price 
regulation and investment in pharmaceutical R & D. Using a panel data set with data 
on fourteen large pharmaceutical firms in the world for the period 1994 – 1997, 
Vernon (2005) estimated the effects of expected profitability and cash flow on R & D 
investment intensity, as measured by the ratio of R & D expenditures to total sales. 
 His empirical analysis yielded three important findings. First, both pharma-
ceutical profit expectations and lagged cash flows had significant positive impacts 
on the amount firms invest in R & D. Lagged cash flow is the amount of revenue 
over cost accruing to the company in the previous period. Second, the mean pre-tax 
pharmaceutical profit margin in a nonregulated (the US) market was approximately 
four to five times as large as that in regulated (non-US) markets. Third, simulations 
revealed that R & D investment would decline by 23 – 33 percent if the United States 
adopted pharmaceutical price regulation. 
 Giaccotto, Santerre, and Vernon (2005)  used US industry-level data for the 
years 1952 – 2001 to estimate the relationship between real drug prices and R & D 
investment. They found that real drug prices (drug prices relative to the consumer 
price index for all goods and services) had a significant positive impact on 
R & D investment. The elasticity estimate of about 0.6 implies that a 10 percent 
increase in real drug prices leads to a 6 percent increase in pharmaceutical R & D 
investment. 
 In addition to the direct effect on a firm ’ s R & D investment behavior, price 
regulation adversely affects incentives for pharmaceutical innovation indirectly 
through its impact on market competition. Several studies have shown that drug 
price regulation leads to a downward-sloping price curve over the drug ’ s life

cycle — prices fall as more time from the date of drug introduction elapses ( Danzon 
and Chao 2000b ;  Ekelund and Persson 2003 ). Regulatory pressure on prices over 
the product life cycle may provide a disincentive for the pharmaceutical firm to 
develop new products with important therapeutic gains. Pharmaceutical firms 
based in countries with substantial regulation of pharmaceutical prices tend to 
focus on quick but minor innovations, such as introducing line extension through 
a stream of minor new products (e.g., new dosage forms) in order to obtain a higher 
price on the new products. 
 Grabowski and Wang (2006)  used global new chemical entities (NCEs) and 
first-in-class NCEs to measure the importance of pharmaceutical innovation. They 
defined global NCEs as those introduced in at least four of the G7 countries 
(Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the United States), the world ’ s 
largest pharmaceutical markets. They defined first-in-class NCEs as the first NCE 
in a therapeutic class. 
 They found that global NCEs accounted for over half of all NCE launches in 
the United States during 1982 – 2003, and first-in-class NCEs accounted for about a 
fifth of all NCE launches in the United States during the same period (  table 9.2 ). 
By contrast, the shares of global NCEs and first-in-class NCEs were only about 10 
percent and 3 percent, respectively, in Italy and Japan, implying that pharmaceuti-
cal innovation is retarded in countries with price regulation.

 Furthermore, price regulation reduces incentives for innovation through its 
impact on the launch delay of new drugs. Based on a sample of NCE launches 
between 1994 and 1998 in 85 major markets,  Danzon, Wang, and Wang (2005)  
found that the expected price of a new product in a country significantly affects 
the timing and occurrence of a launch in that country. Countries with lower 
expected prices tend to have fewer launches and longer launch delays. Such delays 
and fewer launches of new drugs or no launch reduce expected revenues that the 
firm can recoup from its R & D investment, thus lowering its incentive to invest in 
pharmaceutical R & D. 
 9.2 
 Pricing of New Drugs 
 Rationale for Patents and Public Policy Trade-offs 
 A patent is an exclusive right to use of knowledge of a new chemical structure, 
which in turn allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to have a monopoly on their 
new products for a fixed period of time to allow them to recoup their investments 
from the monopoly profit. The outcome of pharmaceutical R & D is knowledge about 
a new chemical structure. Once the new drug is marketed and available to potential 
competitors as well as patients, it is a relatively easy matter for a competitor to 
learn the chemical structure and develop a copy. A low cost of imitation implies 
a low cost of entry into the market for the product. Competition from imitators 
reduces the product ’ s price. Thus, an innovator could not generally recoup the cost 
of R & D investment without patent protection. 
 Compared to the high R & D cost per new NCE, the estimated cost of bringing 
imitative products (generic drugs) to the market is less than 1 percent of the R & D 
investment outlay incurred by the initial NCE developer ( Reiffen and Ward 2005 ). 
The generic imitator does not need to undertake many of the same safety and effi-
cacy tests as the innovator to gain regulatory agency approval. Under the current 
regulation in many countries, the primary requirement for generic manufacturers 
is that they demonstrate the bioequivalence of a drug to the innovator ’ s product. 
 The very large difference in the fixed cost of bringing a new product to market 
between innovators and imitators implies that patents are an important incentive 
for pharmaceutical R & D (  fig.9.5 ). As emphasized above, the cost of developing new 
pharmaceutical products is substantial. Once these products are developed, receive 
government approval, and are marketed, the high R & D expenditures become a fixed 
or sunk cost. The substantial high fixed cost leads to a decline in average unit cost 
per unit of output (AC) as firms increase the quantity of output. Compared to the 
high fixed cost, the marginal cost of producing, packaging, and distributing an 
additional batch of product tends to be quite low, much less than the AC. The 
marginal cost curve (MC) is a flat line and lies below a negatively sloped AC curve.  

380 
 Part II / Chapter 9
 Let  D be the demand curve. Marginal revenue corresponding to the  D curve 
is represented by MR curve. Under the patent system, innovators possess market 
power to set product price. To pursue maximum profit, the innovator sets its 
optimal quantity of output at the output level where marginal revenue equals mar-
ginal cost, which is  x 1. The innovator then prices the new drug at  p 1 . Since  p 1 
exceeds average unit cost at  x 1, the innovator earns a profit per unit of output, the 
vertical distance between points  b and  c . The profit that accrues to the innovator 
is the area of the rectangle  p 1 bcd . 
 This pharmaceutical research firm recoups its R & D cost from this profit, 
which creates the incentive for innovation. Monopoly pricing achieves dynamic 
efficiency — which means that there are adequate financial incentives for firms to 
undertake those R & D investments for products for which patient willingness to pay 
in the aggregate exceeds the full cost of bringing the products to market, including 
the cost of R & D investments. 
 However, monopoly pricing limits the use of the drug below the socially 
optimal rate of use and hence creates a loss in social welfare. At the monopoly 
price, there are consumers with a willingness to pay (as shown by market demand 
curve  D ) in excess of the marginal cost of producing the good. Thus, there is a 
welfare loss, equal to the area of triangle  abe.

 At a given point in time, pharmaceutical technology is fixed. The optimal 
allocation of resources in the short-run, or the output level consistent with static 
efficiency, is at the output at which marginal social benefit (SMB) from consuming 
the drug equals the marginal social cost (SMC) of producing, packaging, and dis-
tributing the drug. In the absence of externalities, static efficiency can be achieved 
by competition which drives the price of new drugs down to marginal cost,  p 2 , 
where social marginal benefit ( D curve) and social marginal cost (MC curve) are 
equal. However, since  p 2 is below the average unit cost corresponding to quantity 
of output  x 2 , this competitive price does not allow firms to recoup their R & D invest-
ment outlays. 
 The above analysis suggests that the cost structure of innovative firms, in 
combination with the patent protection that provides a legal barrier preventing 
entry by imitative firms, creates a time inconsistency problem in pricing new 
pharmaceutical products. There is a trade-off between static efficiency (in the short 
run) and dynamic efficiency (in the long run). On the one hand, patents allow firms 
to charge prices for new drugs at monopoly levels, which provides an incentive 
for innovative firms to develop new products. On the other hand, if competitively 
set prices are the ideal and the relevant reference point, there is a welfare loss from 
monopoly pricing. Thus, there is a trade-off between preserving incentives for 
innovation, on the one hand, and reducing the welfare loss by removing barriers 
to generic competition on the other. 
 During the period of patent protection, only one firm produces the drug based 
on a specific set of chemical ingredients. However, while such patent protection 
is a source of market power, it is incorrect to infer that the patent holder necessar-
ily possesses monopoly power in its market. The reason is that, in general, a par-
ticular disease (e.g., diabetes, depression) can be treated by various drugs that, 
although differing in precise chemical composition, have similar therapeutic 
properties. 
 For example, several drugs are designed to lower blood glucose levels of 
persons diagnosed with diabetes. There are also several antidepressants. An anti-
depressant on patent competes with other patented antidepressants and many other 
generic antidepressants whose patents have expired. A patent is for a specific 
combination of chemicals embodied in a product. Drugs in the same therapeutic 
category, say, antidepressants, but with different chemical compositions compete 
with one another. 
 Because of differences in chemical composition and genetic differences 
among patients, there may be a better match between drug and patients for some 
drugs in a therapeutic category than for others. Match is measured in terms of 
therapeutic effectiveness (did the patient get better?) and lack of adverse side effects 
(did the patient suffer adverse outcomes attributable to use of the drug, e.g., dry 
mouth for some antidepressants?). Or several drugs within the therapeutic category 

382 
 Part II / Chapter 9
may match well and others not so well. Since the interactions between patients 
and drugs vary appreciably among patients, it can be a major task for a physician 
to find a good match between the patient and the drug. Price is one factor, but the 
quality of the match is also a major determinant of drug choice. 
 Most branded drugs face some competition. Using a sample consisting of 148 
new branded drugs introduced into the US market,  Lu and Comanor (1998)  found 
that all but 13 had at least one competitor within the same therapeutic category; 
the mean number of competitors was 1.86. These findings imply that the market 
structure of branded drugs with patent protection more closely resembles a dif-
ferentiated oligopoly than a pure monopoly. 
 An oligopolist has few competitors, which are easily identified by all sellers 
in a market. Oligopolists ’ strategies are interdependent. Relevant strategies include 
pricing and advertising. It does make a difference to an individual oligopolist ’ s 
product demand, for example, if competitors follow its price decrease or keep the 
price as it was. 
 While there are many competitors in a competitive market, such as farmers 
growing tomatoes, there are few pharmaceutical manufacturers that have a branded 
product in a particular therapeutic category. In setting prices, an oligopolist takes 
account of price changes its oligopolist competitors might make if the oligopolist 
were to change its price. By contrast, an individual tomato farmer has no control 
over price. The farmer ’ s only choices (a nontrivial number) are how many tomatoes 
to grow, of which variety, and perhaps how much to invest in tomato growing, how 
often to water the plants, how much fertilizer to use, how to scare away the birds 
and insects, how much scaring to engage in, and so on. The farmer ’ s strategy is 
based on anticipated outcomes for the market as a whole, not on the behavior of 
particular (other) farmers. 
 Pricing New Drugs: Empirical Evidence 
 A new drug ’ s price is largely determined by demand conditions in the market. Such 
demand conditions include patients ’ valuations of the new drug and whether or 
not the new drug is covered by health insurance (see   fig. 9.5 ). Only a few countries, 
such as the United States and Germany, allow pharmaceutical firms to set the prices 
of their new products. Thus, the empirical evidence on pricing new drugs comes 
from these two countries. In most countries, the government sets the prices of 
pharmaceutical products. 
 Lu and Comanor (1998)  reported that the launch price of new drugs in the 
United States primarily reflects consumers ’ marginal valuations of the new drugs, 
not their marginal production cost. More specifically, pharmaceutical manufactur-
ers adopt a  “ skimming strategy ” to extract high prices from consumers willing to 
pay a lot for a new drug that represents a major therapeutic advance over existing 
competitive products. Manufacturers initially set the price of the new innovative 
drug two or three times higher than the price of the existing product. When com-

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 383
petitors follow with innovative but similar new products of their own, the origina-
tors gradually reduce their price as these competitors enter into the market. 
 For example, consider the market for antidepressants. About two decades ago, 
manufacturers introduced antidepressant drugs called selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs). Before the introduction of the first SSRI, which was Eli 
Lilly Company ’ s Prozac, other drugs, such as tricylics, were prescribed for depres-
sion; although effective, they had certain adverse side effects, such as causing dry 
mouth. 
 The SSRIs were a major therapeutic advance. However, over time, following 
Prozac, other companies introduced SSRIs, among them Zoloft and Paxil, which 
are not chemically identical to Prozac but are sufficiently similar to Prozac to be 
classified as SSRIs. While the older drugs competed with Prozac before the other 
SSRIs were introduced, the other SSRIs are closer substitutes for Prozac than the 
older drugs are. 
 By contrast, pharmaceutical companies often adopt a penetration strategy in 
pricing their new products that have little or no therapeutic advantages over exist-
ing products by setting launch prices at or below those of their substitutes. However, 
Lu and Comanor found that the mean real price increased substantially over time, 
presumably after the drugs became the drug of choice for a group of users. In the 
market for SSRIs, Prozac represented a major therapeutic advance. Zoloft and Paxil, 
while not identical to Prozac chemically and therefore possibly more effective and 
with fewer adverse side effects for some patients than Prozac (and vice versa), did 
not represent major therapeutic breakthroughs when they were introduced. Once 
an SSRI seems to work for a patient, physicians are reluctant to prescribe another 
SSRI. To change, the patient needs to gradually reduce the dosage of the currently 
prescribed SSRI and then take the new SSRI for a while to gauge its benefit. In this 
sense, once on an SSRI, a patient is  “ hooked ”  (not in the same sense as one is 
hooked on an illicit drug, but sufficiently so as to make the demand elasticity for 
the SSRI the patient is using quite inelastic). 
 Lu and Comanor also found that launch prices of drugs used to treat acute 
conditions, for example, anti-infectives, were set higher than those indicated for 
chronic illnesses, even after accounting for the degree of therapeutic advance. This 
evidence reinforces the previous finding that the launch price of new drugs depends 
primarily on consumers ’ marginal valuation of the products. Marginal valuations 
are high for new anti-infectives since many patients may have developed resistance 
to existing products. 
 Based on the data obtained from Germany,  Pavcnik (2002)  also found empiri-
cal evidence that the price of brand-name drugs is responsive to the change of 
demand conditions. Prior to 1989, prescription drugs were covered by statutory 
health insurance in Germany. Patients paid only a fixed prescription fee. In 1989, 
Germany introduced a reference pricing policy that imposes a maximum reim-
bursement price for a given product. The patient bears the excess cost out of pocket 

384 
 Part II / Chapter 9
if the market price of the pharmaceutical product exceeds the maximum reimburse-
ment. Because the consumer bears the amount above the reference price in full, 
implementing reference pricing should shift the demand curve for prescription 
drugs inward (relative to a policy in which insurance pays more for higher-priced 
drugs). As a result of the change to reference pricing, the markup of price over 
marginal cost declines. 
 The empirical results are consistent with this prediction.  Pavcnik (2002)  
found that the pricing behavior of pharmaceutical firms is very sensitive to poten-
tial patient out-of-pocket expenses. On average, price declines following the change 
in statutory health insurance reimbursement ranged from 10 to 26 percent. In addi-
tion, Pavcnik found that price declines were more pronounced for brand-name 
products than for generics. 
 9.3 
 Entry of Generic Drugs and Its Consequences 
 Competition between Generic and Brand-Name Drugs 
 When a patent on a brand-name drug expires, generic drugs enter the market, 
resulting in competition between generic and brand-name drugs. The entry of 
generics raises three important issues related to drug pricing. First, how do imita-
tive firms price their generic products? Second, how does the innovative firm, the 
producer of the brand-name drug, respond to the entry of generics? Third, how 
does the price regulation affect the competition between generic and brand-name 
drugs? 
 Several empirical studies have studied the pricing behavior of firms with 
generic products.  Caves, Whinston, and Hurwitz (1991)  reported that the launch 
price of generic products in the United States ranges from 40 to 70 percent of the 
price of the brand-name drug before the patent expired. Subsequently, the price of 
generic products declines as more generic products enter the market. 
 For example, the authors found that the generic price fell to about 29 percent 
of its pre-patent expiration price ( “ base price ” ) when there were 10 competitors in 
the market. As the number of competitors increased to twenty, the generic price 
was set at only about 17 percent of the base price. 
 Empirical results of recent studies are consistent with this finding, indicating 
that generic firms set lower prices when there are more competitors. The price of 
generic drugs at two years after entry declined to 54 percent of the original price 
level at the date of entry (  table 9.3 ). Thus, based on both theory and empirical 
evidence, the long-run equilibrium price of a generic product approaches the prod-
uct ’ s marginal cost (see, e.g.,  Reiffen and Ward 2005 ).  
 Firms with branded products adopt an entirely different pricing strategy. Both 
 Caves, Whinston, and Hurwitz (1991)  and  Grabowski and Vernon (1992)  found that 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 385
the prices of the original branded drug remained constant or even increased slightly 
after a generic ’ s entry. Based on a sample of ten major drugs in the United States, 
 table 9.3  shows that the mean price of brand-name drugs rose 9 percent two years 
after generic entry. The reason is that the market becomes segmented as the generic 
products enter the market. Price-sensitive consumers shift to generic products, and 
price-insensitive consumers continue using the brand-name drugs, even after 
patent expiration. The brand-loyal consumers may believe that the branded drug 
is better than the generic even though they are chemically identical, perhaps 
because the branded seller has better quality control. When the price elasticity for 
a product is lower, the price is higher. 
 With generic prices declining sharply and branded price rising slightly over 
time, the ratio of generic to brand-name prices should decrease over time. At date 
of generic drug entry, this ratio was 0.68. Two years after generic entry, this ratio 
declined to 0.33 (  table 9.3 ). 
 However, the story does not end here.  Hurwitz and Caves (1988)  reported that 
the branded firm lost more market share after generic entry when the price differ-
ence between branded and generic drugs was higher. Generic firms on average 
gained about 20 percent of market share at entry. Two years after entry, generic 
market share increased to about 73 percent (  table 9.3 ). 
 The above empirical findings come from the United States, where firms can 
freely set prices for their pharmaceutical products.  Danzon and Chao (2000b ) 
obtained evidence that price regulation undermines generic competition in regu-
lated markets, such as in France, Italy, and Japan. In these three countries, there is 
little association between drug prices and the number of generic competitors. This 
implies that a fixed regulated price serves to protect a generic firm from the adverse 
effects of competition from other generic firms on its product prices. In other 
words, under drug price regulation, there is no direct market pressure to lower 
prices as additional generic firms enter the market.

386 
 Part II / Chapter 9
 In addition, several empirical studies have demonstrated that the prices 
of branded drugs tend to fall substantially over time in markets subject to price 
regulation. Thus, in a regulated market, the seller of a brand-name drug has no 
latitude in affecting price through any competitive strategy ( Ekelund and Persson 
2003 ). 
 Combining the above two stylized facts from regulated markets, the price 
difference between brand-name and generic drugs in a regulated market is small 
and remains almost constant over time. By contrast, in a market in which pharma-
ceutical manufacturers are price makers, the real price of branded drugs may rise 
over time and the price of generic drugs may decline sharply as more generic drugs 
enter the market. Thus, in a free market, the price difference between brand-name 
and generic drugs is large at one point in time and increases over time as compared 
to a regulated market. 
 For example, in the United States, the average generic-to-brand price ratio 
declines to about 0.3 over three years after the first generic entry ( Saha, Grabowski, 
Birnbaum, et al. 2006 ). However, in a regulated market such as Taiwan, the average 
generic-to-brand price ratio is about 0.70 – 0.85 ( Liu, Yang, and Hsieh 2009 ). 
 Factors Affecting Generic Competition 
 Four factors are important determinants of the extent of generic competition: 
(1) the cost of generic entry, (2) the expected profit from generic entry, (3) public 
policies allowing generic substitution, and (4) incentives for generic substitution 
among consumers, physicians, and pharmacists. 
 The cost of generic entry is the most important determinant of generic com-
petition ( Grabowski 2007 ). Before enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, a 
generic firm in the United States had to undertake many of the same safety and 
efficacy tests as the branded firm did to gain the government approval for market-
ing its product. The high cost of new clinical trials served to deter market entry of 
generic drugs. As a result, about two-thirds of brand-name drugs with large sales 
whose patents had expired had no generic competitors in the early 1980s. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act established an Abbreviated New Drug Application 
(ANDA) for generic firms, which allows generic firms to rely on the safety and 
efficacy clinical trial data of the brand-name drug. Thus, the primary current 
requirement for generic firms to secure approval for generic entry is to demonstrate 
that their drugs are the bioequivalents of the branded products. This statute greatly 
reduced the cost of generic entry. Consequently, the entry of generics into the US 
market increased rapidly after 1984. The market share (based on drug quantities) 
of generic drugs rose from 19 percent in 1984 to 51 percent in 2002 ( Grabowski 
2007 ). 
 Since producers of generic drugs, like producers of brand-name drugs, are 
organized as for-profit enterprises, it is not surprising that generic entry is more 
likely in markets with larger expected revenues or higher profit margins. Several 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 387
studies have shown that the number of generic entrants significantly depends on 
the profit margins earned by firms with branded products. 
 Specifically, generic firms are more likely to enter markets for chronic condi-
tions with large sales. In addition, generic entry was positively related to the pre-
competition sales revenue received by the branded firm ( Grabowski and Vernon 
1992 ;  Morton and Scott 1999 ;  Morton 2000 ).  Danzon and Chao (2000b ) also found 
that low regulated prices for branded products at the time of patent expiration 
discourage market entry of generics in regulated markets. 
 The third factor affecting the extent of generic competition relates to whether 
or not institutional arrangements, embodied in law, public regulation, or custom, 
permit generic substitution. With generic substitution as practiced in the United 
States, the physician writes a prescription for a brand-name drug, such as Paxil. 
Unless the physician specifies otherwise, the pharmacist can substitute the generic 
drug equivalent if it is available. 
 In many Asian countries, such as China, Japan and Taiwan, physicians both 
prescribe  and  dispense drugs. Thus, they are in a position to profit directly from 
the sale of prescription drugs. This system, in combination with government regu-
lation of the reimbursement price for prescription drugs, allows physicians to 
capture the profit margin, the difference between the selling price and the acquisi-
tion price from the wholesale market. Given this arrangement, physician prescrip-
tion decisions do not reflect drug price differences but rather differences in drug 
profit margins. This in turn forces pharmaceutical manufacturers to compete in the 
wholesale market by cutting price below the selling price or the price that physi-
cians receive from health insurance when they prescribe the drug. Manufacturers 
can induce physicians to switch prescriptions to their drugs by increasing the profit 
margin offered to dispensing physicians ( Danzon and Chao 2000b ;  Iizuka 2007 ). 
Under this system, the only motivation for generic substitution is if generic firms 
offer higher profit margins to physicians than those for branded drugs. This is 
highly likely given that the entry (fixed) cost of generic drugs is far lower than for 
brand-name drugs.  Liu, Yang, and Hsieh (2009)  found evidence that obtaining a 
profit, the difference between the reimbursement amount and the acquisition price, 
has provided a major inducement for generic substitution in Taiwan. 
 In Western countries, by contrast, the separation of prescribing and dispens-
ing drugs has long been accepted practice. Since physicians typically prescribe by 
brand rather than by chemical name, generic substitution is possible only if the 
law expressly allows pharmacists to substitute generics for branded counterparts. 
For example, in the United States, by the 1990s, all states had enacted substitution 
laws that authorized pharmacists to substitute generic equivalents unless the pre-
scribing physician took specific steps to prohibit substitution, such as explicitly 
writing  “ dispense as written. ” By contrast, in other countries, such as France and 
Italy, generic substitution by pharmacists is not permitted ( Danzon and Chao 
2000b ;  Grabowski 2007 ). 

388 
 Part II / Chapter 9
 Given that the prices of generic products are lower than those of their branded 
counterparts, health insurers have a strong incentive to encourage generic substitu-
tion when permissive substitution laws permit this. In the United States, for 
example, health insurers have designed explicit incentives to increase utilization 
of generic drugs. Many health insurers offer incentives to consumers to increase 
the utilization of generic drugs by using a three-tiered cost-sharing approach. Under 
such an arrangement, the insurer imposes co-payments per prescription on its 
insured patients, and the amount of the co-payment varies with the tier of formu-
lary system (see chapter 3). 
 Health insurers also provide various incentives to influence physicians ’ pre-
scribing behavior. Among these, the most powerful incentive to enhance physi-
cians ’  willingness to comply with formularies is to provide physicians with 
financial incentives to avoid drug spending in excess of a certain amount. In addi-
tion, some insurers pay higher dispensing fees if pharmacists dispense generic 
drugs instead of their branded counterparts ( Grabowski 2007 ). Health insurers, 
such as managed care organizations, by affecting physicians ’ incentives, can have 
a major influence on the growth in use of generic products. In particular,  Saha, 
Grabowski, Birnbaum, et al. (2006)  found empirical evidence that the growth of 
enrollments in managed care plans in the United States markedly increased the 
market share of generic products, after controlling for other influences on demand 
for and supply of generic products. 
 Consequences of Generic Competition 
 Given that the prices of generic products are lower than those of brand-name drugs, 
the use of generic products is generally cost saving. The amount of cost savings, 
however, depends on the price difference between branded and generic drugs. As 
seen above, this price differential is larger in unregulated pharmaceutical markets 
than in markets in which prices are regulated. Thus, in an unregulated market, 
generic competition generates significant cost savings to health insurers and hence 
is an effective policy tool for cost containment. 
 Another important consequence of generic competition is its impact on phar-
maceutical innovation. Pricing new drugs by the criterion of static efficiency does 
not preserve incentives for pharmaceutical innovation, although it removes the 
welfare loss from monopoly pricing (see discussion of   fig. 9.5  above). It is conse-
quently very tempting for public decision makers in small countries to focus on 
static efficiency, that is, not providing adequate financial incentives for R & D, since 
they perceive that their policies will not affect the development of new products. 
Policy makers with short time horizons in larger countries may be similarly 
tempted. Therefore, a key policy challenge is how to achieve an appropriate balance 
between static efficiency, which reflects short-term benefits from greater price 
competition, and dynamic efficiency, which also reflects long-term benefits from 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 389
appropriate incentives for innovation. Generic competition provides an approach 
for achieving such policy balance. 
 Generic competition in unregulated markets often leads to a large decline in 
sales of brand-name drugs within a very short period, which in turn reduces phar-
maceutical R & D investment ( Grabowski 2007 ). A decrease in the expected revenue 
of R & D output decreases the incentive to invest in pharmaceutical R & D. However, 
under the current patent system, generic entry is an expected outcome following 
patent expiration. Thus, the threat of generic competition consequently forces firms 
manufacturing branded products (those still under patent) to implement various 
strategic responses in advance of patent expiration, especially on their important 
products, such as investing in new products and maintaining a healthy pipeline 
of products under development. This suggests that market pressure arising from 
generic competition is a key incentive for pharmaceutical innovation. The decline 
in generic competition resulting from price regulation weakens incentives for such 
innovation. 
 In short, generic entry promotes market competition, which in turn may 
outweigh the effect of revenue loss and provide a positive incentive for pharma-
ceutical manufacturers to increase investment in R & D. Therefore, in an unregulated 
market, generic competition potentially can achieve a good balance between static 
and dynamic efficiency. By contrast, in a regulated market, price regulation under-
mines generic competition, which in turn reduces the favorable effects of generic 
competition on pharmaceutical innovation. 
 9.4 
 Advertising 
 A key attribute of the pharmaceutical market is imperfect information about the 
effectiveness of particular drugs. Patients often lack sufficient information to know 
when specific drugs are appropriate for treatment. Therefore, physicians act as 
front-line professional agents, making consumption decisions on behalf of patients. 
Prescription drugs, in contrast to drugs purchased by consumers  “ over-the-coun-
ter, ” require a prescription from a physician, by definition. 
 However, even physicians may have difficulty in gauging the value of specific 
drugs in absolute terms and relative to their cost. One reason is that patients with 
a particular diagnosis tend to be heterogeneous, both with respect to the severity 
of their disease and in their genetic makeup. Especially because of genetic differ-
ences, drugs often work differently on different people, and the adverse side effects 
of drugs differ as well. People even differ on how willing they are to tolerate 
adverse side effects as a trade-off for a particular therapeutic gain. 
 Some people, for example, are very intolerant of the discomfort that may 
accompany taking a particular drug. Others are quite tolerant of discomfort, which 

390 
 Part II / Chapter 9
they are willing to bear as a trade-off for getting better. Some may suffer little dis-
comfort, while others face substantial discomfort from taking the same drug. 
 Another source of physician ignorance is the large number of new drugs 
introduced annually. It is difficult for individual physicians to keep up with thera-
peutic gains, adverse side effects, and prices of so many new drugs. Information 
on whether the quality of a new product exceeds the quality of an older one in its 
therapeutic class on average is often lacking. At least as of the 1990s, and we know 
of no objective evidence that the situation has markedly changed since then, there 
were few objective head-to-head comparisons of specific drugs ( Sloan, Whetten-
Goldstein, and Wilson 1997 ). 
 In a head-to-head comparison, effectiveness and adverse side effects of spe-
cific drugs are compared. By contrast, in a drug randomized, controlled trial (RCT), 
the drug is compared against either no drug treatment or an existing drug treatment, 
but not against the full set of pharmaceutical alternatives that a physician considers 
when making a choice of drug for a particular patient. 
 One reason for the lack of head-to-head comparisons is that such comparisons 
are often expensive to make, and public regulatory authorities do not typically 
require them. Long-term effects, either favorable or adverse, cannot be known from 
RCTs that precede regulatory approval. In addition, other applications of new drugs 
are often discovered following a drug ’ s initial introduction. For example, a drug 
that helps prevent osteoporosis in women may be found to be useful in preventing 
breast cancer. 
 Over time, physicians gain knowledge about patterns of heterogeneity among 
individual patients, both beneficial and adverse effects. Some amount of individu-
alized learning on the part of patients and their physicians occurs ( Crawford and 
Shum 2005 ), but this learning process can be costly in terms of health and the use 
of health care resources. 
 In response to the lack of information on quality, pharmaceutical manufactur-
ers rely on various forms of marketing and advertising to disseminate the quality 
information on specific drugs to physicians, such as sending sales representatives 
to visit physicians in their offices and provide them with oral explanations of the 
drug ’ s beneficial effects as well as written promotional materials and free samples. 
 In two countries, the United States and New Zealand, pharmaceutical com-
panies are allowed to advertise their products directly to consumers ( Berndt and 
Donohue 2008 ). In general, however, physicians are the targets of drug advertising. 
The following section analyzes the pharmaceutical firm ’ s incentive to spend 
resources on marketing, the composition of such marketing efforts, and their effects. 
 Companies ’ Incentives to Allocate Funds to Marketing 
 In many countries, prescription drugs are one of the most heavily promoted prod-
ucts. For example, in 1996, US pharmaceutical firms spent 14.2 percent of their 
sales revenue on product promotion (  table 9.4 ). In 2003, they spent 17.1 percent.  

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers

 As a profit maximizer, a pharmaceutical manufacturer expends marketing 
resources up to the point at which the incremental net revenue from sales resulting 
from the additional advertising expense equals that expense. Based on this condi-
tion, a classic paper showed that in equilibrium, the ratio of the optimal advertising 
expenditure ( A ) to sales ( S ) satisfies the following relationship ( Dorfman and 
Steiner 1954 ): 
 A / S =  E a [( p  –  MC )/ p ] =  E a / E p , 
(9.1) 
 where  E a is the advertising elasticity of demand, indicating the percentage change 
of the quantity demand in corresponding to a given percentage change in advertis-
ing expenditure;  p is the product price;  MC is the marginal cost; ( p  –  MC )/ p is the 
price-cost margin, which is equal to 1/ E p ; and  E p is the absolute value of the price 
elasticity of demand. 
 Equation 9.1 implies that firms allocate a larger share of their resources to 
advertising when (1) the price-cost margin is higher, (2) the advertising elasticity 
of demand is higher, and (3) the price elasticity of demand is lower. This equation 
is useful for explaining why pharmaceutical manufacturers allocate a relatively 
large share of their resources to advertising. 
 First, as discussed above, by conferring market power on firms, patent protec-
tion enables firms to price their products much above marginal cost. This high 
price-cost margin mainly reflects a combination of a high fixed (R & D) cost and a 
low marginal (production and distribution) cost. Therefore, compared to other 
industries, the price-cost margin in the pharmaceutical industry is very high. This 
high price-cost margin gives pharmaceutical manufacturers a major incentive to 
allocate resources to advertising. Given the low marginal cost of output in this

sector, pharmaceutical companies have a strong incentive to shift the demand 
curves for their products outward by advertising. 
 Second, drug advertising and detailing to physicians are important for inform-
ing physicians as drug prescribers about the availability of particular branded 
products and about their attributes (and scientific evidence on these attributes). 
Direct-to-consumer advertising is aimed at making the consumer aware of the 
product so that consumers can ask their physicians if the drug is appropriate for 
them ( Berndt and Donohue 2008 ). 
 Third, expenditures on prescription drugs are often covered by health insur-
ance, especially in high-income countries. An effect of health insurance coverage 
is to reduce the price elasticity of demand for prescription drugs. The price elastic-
ity of demand for prescription drugs ranges from  – 0.1 to  – 0.2, indicating that a 10 
percent increase in out-of-pocket payment leads to a decrease in the quantity of 
prescription drugs of only 1 – 2 percent ( Berndt 2007 ). For this reason, growth in 
insurance coverage for prescribed drugs should greatly increase pharmaceutical 
company spending on advertising. 
 Composition of Pharmaceutical Company Marketing 
 The promotional efforts of pharmaceutical manufacturers have traditionally tar-
geted physicians. Such efforts include advertising in medical journals, the provi-
sion of free samples to physicians, and detailing — one-on-one encounters between 
pharmaceutical sales representatives and individual physicians. 
 However, beginning in the 1990s, increased pressure for drug cost contain-
ment led pharmaceutical manufacturers to target consumers directly in drug pro-
motion in the two countries that permit it. One motive for direct-to-consumer 
advertising (DTCA) is to encourage physicians to prescribe drugs that are on the 
list of drugs covered by the insurance plan, that is, on the plan ’ s formulary. The 
other motive is a bit more indirect. If in response to DTCA, patients ask physicians 
sufficiently often about a drug not on the formulary, this will create pressure for 
its inclusion ( Scherer 2000 ). Other reasons for the growth of DTCA include increased 
consumer empowerment, growth in insurance coverage of prescription drugs, and 
the baby boom cohort becoming older and experiencing identifiable symptoms 
treatable with prescription drugs ( Berndt 2002 ). 
 The marketing practices of pharmaceuticals have changed in recent years 
with growth in DTCA and declines in such promotional expenses as on detailing 
( table 9.4 ). In 1996, drug manufacturers on average allocated about one-third of 
their promotional expenditures to detailing. By 2003, the share was about a fifth 
of promotional expenditures. Similarly, the share of promotional expenditure spent 
on medical journal advertising decreased from 5 percent in 1996 to slightly less 
than 2 percent by 2003. By contrast, the share of promotional expenditure spent 
on DTCA increased from nearly 9 percent in 1996 to nearly 15 percent in 2003. 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 393
 Detailing and its Effects 
 Except for the free sample provision to physicians, the largest component of mar-
keting is detailing to physicians (  table 9.4 ).  Detailing  mainly consists of marketing 
efforts to differentiate the detailer ’ s product from its competitors ’ in product attri-
butes other than price, such as evidence of drug efficacy, frequency of dosage per 
day, adverse interactions with other drugs, other adverse side effects, and indica-
tions for which the regulatory agency has granted approval of the drug. Detailing 
also seeks to promote brand loyalty among those prescribers already using the 
product. The quantity and quality of the new products affect the amount of detail-
ing that firms conduct, which serves to emphasize the role of information provision 
in detailing. 
 Berndt, Bui, Reiley, et al. (1995)  conducted an empirical analysis that revealed 
that both detailing to physicians and medical journal advertising raise both market 
demand and market share (relative to incumbents ’ ). Also, DTCA has a positive 
impact on market demand, although the estimated elasticity is relatively small. The 
sum of those three marketing elasticities ( E a ) is 0.76, indicating that a 10 percent 
increase in cumulative marketing information stock leads to a 7.6 percent increase 
in the market demand. Among the channels of marketing efforts they studied, 
Berndt and co-authors found that detailing to physicians is most effective, with an 
elasticity estimate of 0.55, which accounted for about 72 percent (0.55/0.76) of the 
overall effect of marketing on demand. 
 Direct-to-Consumer Advertising and Its Effects 
 Although the importance of DTCA has increased, not every firm in the two coun-
tries that permit it has selected DTCA as a promotional strategy.  Berndt (2007)  
reported that only 18 percent of the 391 major branded-drug companies marketing 
in the United States allocated any funds to DTCA, and expenditures on DTCA were 
highly concentrated on about twenty products. DTCA spending is targeted to spe-
cific therapeutic classes and drugs. DTCA intensity varies widely among therapeu-
tic classes, from relatively low for antidepressants to relatively high for nasal 
sprays. Based on panel data obtained on 169 drugs and 21 therapeutic classes 
during 1996 – 1999,  Iizuka (2004)  found that DTCA spending is positively associated 
with potential market size and drug quality (measured by whether or not the drug 
is a major therapeutic advance over the existing drugs) but negatively associated 
with the vintage of drugs and the entry of generic drugs. Conceptually, the elasticity 
of sales with respect to advertising ( E a ) is greater for higher-quality products and 
products with a larger potential market size. By contrast, advertising elasticities 
decline as drugs age and generic products enter the market. Hence, empirical find-
ings are consistent with the equation 9.1 ’ s theoretical prediction that firms devote 
a relatively large share of their resources to advertising when the advertising elas-
ticity is relatively high. 

394 
 Part II / Chapter 9
 Overall, empirical research on DTCA indicates that the primary effect of 
DTCA spending is to increase aggregate market demand for products in a 
therapeutic category rather than to raise market shares of individual pharmaceuti-
cal products. Specifically, the empirical evidence shows that the advertising 
elasticity of DTCA spending is around 0.1, implying that a 10 percent increase in 
DTCA spending leads to a 1 percent increase in market demand. In addition, 
empirical research has found that DTCA has a significant positive effect on 
demand for prescription drugs by increasing the share of physician visits during 
which the drug is prescribed. By contrast, the same empirical research has shown 
that DTCA spending has no significant effect on the choice of medication ( Berndt 
2007 ). 
 In sum, the major impact of DTCA is to motivate individuals to visit their 
physicians. Once patients come to physicians ’ offices, prescription choice is still 
primarily determined by physicians. DTCA is effective in increasing market 
demand, but does not significantly influence brand choice and individual pharma-
ceuticals ’  market shares. 
 Given the evidence that DTCA leads to an increase in demand for prescription 
drugs, does DTCA improve patient welfare?  Kravitz, Epstein, Feldman, et al. (2005)  
examined this issue using data from an RCT. This study yielded two important 
findings. First, DTCA mitigated undertreatment for patients visiting physicians 
with a major depressive disorder. Second, DTCA encouraged medically ambiguous 
and questionable utilization of antidepressant drugs for patients with adjustment 
disorders. Taken in combination, these results suggest that the expansion of market 
demand from DTCA may come from two sources: (1) reducing the undertreatment 
of serious illness and (2) increasing some overtreatment or possibly inappropriate 
treatment for patients with less severe symptoms. Thus, these findings, although 
limited to a single condition, suggest that the overall effect of DTCA on consumer 
welfare is ambiguous.

 International Pricing 
 Cross-National Price Differentials 
 Cross-national differences in pharmaceutical prices have long been a source of 
controversy in the public policy arena. People in countries with relatively higher 
prices of drugs often argue that they are paying too much for these products. 
Studies have made cross-national drug price comparisons ( Danzon and Chao 2000a ; 
 Furukawa 2007 ). 
 These studies show that not only does differential pricing for pharmaceuticals 
exist between high-income countries and low-income countries but there are appre-
ciable differences in prices among high-income countries as well. For example, 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 395
 Danzon and Chao (2000a ) found that pharmaceutical prices on average in Germany 
were 25 percent higher than US prices, whereas prices in France were 32 percent 
lower on average, after accounting for variations in dosage and product mix across 
countries. 
 Price differences reflect influences from both the demand and the supply 
sides of the market. On the demand side, many countries regulate drug prices, 
emphasizing static over dynamic efficiency, for two reasons. First, a single country, 
especially a small one, can free ride on larger ones, paying only the marginal cost 
of drug production, packaging, and distribution and allowing others to pay the 
fixed R & D investment costs. Second, given the long lag time between R & D invest-
ment and the launch of a new product, it is easy to pay low prices in the short run 
and suffer the long-run consequences at a much later date ( Danzon and Towse 
2003 ). 
 Prices of branded products under patent tend to be lower in regulated markets, 
such as France and Italy, than in the major unregulated market, the United States 
( Danzon and Furukawa 2003 ). By contrast, market competition often forces the 
price of a generic product down to marginal cost in the unregulated market, while 
regulation undermines the generic competition. Thus, the prices of generic prod-
ucts in several regulated markets, such as Japan and Italy, are higher than in the 
United States. 
 On the other hand, even absent government regulation, pharmaceutical man-
ufacturers as profit maximizers are motivated to engage in price discrimination 
across countries in order to increase their profits. There are two preconditions for 
price discrimination to occur: (1) markets must be separate with demand curves 
differing in their elasticities of demand, and (2) consumers must not be able to 
resell the product across markets. 
 The latter is automatically true of services, such as physician visits or hospital 
days, which cannot be resold. However, drugs are a good, not a service. Thus, resale 
across national boundaries is possible, but made more difficult by declaring resale 
illegal and enforcing the law. Elasticities of demand for pharmaceutical products 
are likely to differ because incomes differ among countries. Also health insurers 
have a major role in determining the price elasticity of demand for drugs. Assum-
ing that these two conditions hold, an optimal pricing rule across markets satisfies 
the following condition: 
 ( p j  –   MC j )/ p j = 1/ E p j ,  
(9.2) 
 where  p j is the price in country  j ,  MC j represents the marginal cost; and  E p j is the 
price elasticity of demand for pharmaceutical in country  j . It is plausible that mar-
ginal cost is the same across countries. Thus, according to equation 9.2, firms set 
price differentials across countries that are inversely related to the demand elastici-
ties for the product in these countries. 

396 
 Part II / Chapter 9
 Several empirical studies have demonstrated that demand is more elastic in 
lower-income countries. Thus, price-discriminating firms tend to price their prod-
ucts lower in such countries and set a higher price in high-income countries. 
 The Consequences of Differential Pricing 
 Compared to uniform pricing of individual pharmaceutical products globally, dif-
ferential pricing has had several important consequences. First, pharmaceutical 
manufacturers tend to sell more drugs with differential pricing than they would 
with uniform pricing. Under a uniform pricing rule, a profit-maximizing firm sets 
a price above the marginal cost, for example,  p 1 in   figure 9.6 . This arrangement 
would price out many consumers in low-income countries who are willing to pay 
prices in excess of the marginal cost but not a price as high as  p 1 . Thus, the welfare 
of these consumers would increase if they could buy the product at a lower price, 
such as  p 2 in   figure 9.6 . Pharmaceutical manufacturers would benefit from these 
additional sales as long as the lower price exceeded marginal cost and the markets 
could be separated. Hence, an important consequence of differential pricing across 
countries is increased access to pharmaceuticals for consumers in low-income 
countries, such as an increase in quantity of consumption from  x 1 to  x 2 , as shown 
in   figure 9.6 . Based on a simulation by comparing the regimes of one price per

country and a single global price,  Dumoulin (2001)  found that differential pricing 
increases access to drugs by a factor of four to seven.  
 Second, although the differential pricing promotes consumer access to drugs, 
it also creates an incentive for parallel trade. Under parallel trade, a particular 
product is imported from one country by a second country and then exported to 
the first country and sold in the first country at a price below the price of the same 
product sold directly by the manufacturer in the first country. For example, suppose 
the price of a particular drug manufactured in the United States is lower in Canada 
than it is in the United States because the US pharmaceutical manufacturer exports 
the drug to Canada at a price lower than it sells the same product in the United 
States. Subsequently the drug is exported from Canada to the United States and 
sold in the United States at a price well below the price at which the drug is sold 
by the manufacturer in the United States. 
 The re-importation of the drug into the United States in turn puts downward 
pressure on the price of the drug in the United States, thus reducing the Canadian-
US price differential that existed prior to reimportation. Pharmaceutical manu-
facturers clearly oppose this practice since it limits their ability to price 
discriminate. 
 Although the existence of parallel trade may increase the efficiency of the 
market in some sectors of the economy, there is no efficiency gain from parallel 
trade in the pharmaceutical market. The reason is that lower prices of pharmaceu-
ticals in some countries do not stem from a comparative advantage in lower R & D 
investment cost or from higher productivity. Rather, the price differentials usually 
result from strict price regulation, lower product liability cost, lack of patent pro-
tection, or lower per capita income, factors that lead pharmaceutical manufacturers 
to set lower prices ( Danzon and Towse 2003 ). Also, parallel trade may increase 
social costs through the extra costs paid for transportation, relabeling, and quality 
control. Despite these concerns, some countries permit the parallel trade of drugs. 
With parallel trade, the precondition of price discrimination that there is no resale 
of goods from low-priced to high-priced markets is violated. Overall, it seems likely 
that a threat of parallel trade would substantially limit cross-national differences 
in pharmaceutical prices. 
 Third, price differences across countries create an incentive for regulators to 
use drug prices in other countries as reference prices for regulating their domestic 
prices. This practice creates a negative externality to the extent that a lower price 
in low-income countries spills over to regulatory price setting in high-income 
countries. Many countries have formally adopted such  “ external referencing ” in 
regulating drug prices, including Canada, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, and Taiwan. 
This external referencing erodes separation of markets, a precondition for price 
discrimination to occur across countries. In response to the threat of external ref-
erencing, pharmaceutical manufacturers tend to set a uniform price or narrow the 
range of price differentials across countries. For example,  Danzon, Wang, and Wang 

398 
 Part II / Chapter 9
(2005)  found that pharmaceutical manufacturers frequently have attempted to 
obtain a uniform launch price from member countries of the European Union, and 
there is a delay in launch or no launch at all in countries that do not permit this 
target price to be used. 
 Fourth, price differentials across countries create an illusion of inequity in 
allocating joint R & D investment costs, which in turn can become a source of fric-
tion in international relations. Some policy makers consider price differentials 
among countries resulting from price controls a barrier to free trade and hence 
attempt to use the threat of trade sanctions to force other countries to set drug 
prices higher ( Reinhardt 2007 ). They often mistakenly assume that joint R & D costs 
should be allocated equally across all countries, at least among high-income coun-
tries. For this reason, lower prices prevailing in regulated markets often are inter-
preted as  “ cost shifting ” from low-price to high-price countries or  “ unfair sharing ” 
in allocating the R & D costs across countries. Therefore, the key to resolving con-
troversies over price differentials across countries lies in finding a satisfactory 
solution for equitably sharing the costs of R & D investments among countries. 
 Ramsey Optimal Pricing 
 The central issue in the international pricing of pharmaceuticals involves 
allocation of the joint costs of R & D investments among countries. Although the 
first-best or fully efficient solution requires product pricing at marginal cost, 
this approach would provide a disincentive for companies to invest in new prod-
ucts.  Danzon and Towse (2003)  argued that Ramsey pricing, described below, 
provides a second-best solution for optimally allocating costs of investments in 
pharmaceutical R & D among countries. This second-best approach provides a 
balance between static efficiency in drug utilization and dynamic efficiency in drug 
innovation. In addition, this approach also satisfies concerns that the solution be 
an equitable one. 
 The following are two necessary conditions for achieving the second best 
solution: 
 p j    MC j .  
(9.3) 
 Σ ( p j  –  MC j )    F .  
(9.4) 
 Inequality 9.3 states that price must be at least equal to marginal cost in each 
country. This condition ensures that the product will be supplied and the pricing 
will satisfy the static efficiency criterion that marginal benefit be greater than or 
equal to marginal cost. Inequality 9.4 states that the price-cost margins across 
countries are large enough when summed together to cover the global joint costs 
of R & D investment ( F ). This condition is a break-even condition for the firm and 
satisfies the dynamic efficiency criterion for investment in R & D.

 Ramsey optimal pricing, named for its developer, Frank P.  Ramsey (1927) , 
has been widely used for many types of pricing decisions, such as government 
price regulation of public utilities. The pricing rule gives an equilibrium solution 
of pricing structure among countries or among markets within countries that maxi-
mizes social welfare subject to the two constraints in inequalities 9.3 and 9.4. The 
equilibrium pricing solution is the following: 
 ( p j  –  MC j )/ p j =  D / E j p ,  
(9.5) 
 where  D represents a profit constraint indicating that the rate of return must be at 
least equal to the cost of capital. Equation 9.5 indicates that the markup of price 
over marginal cost in country  j is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of 
the demand for prescription drugs in country  j . If the marginal cost is the same in 
all countries, the Ramsey optimal pricing solution suggests that prices should differ 
across countries in inverse relation to their demand elasticities. 
 The Ramsey optimal pricing rule in equation 9.5 is a second-best efficiency 
solution because it minimizes the welfare loss resulting from the deviation from 
the first-best outcome. It suggests prices be set at a low markup over marginal cost 
for more price-sensitive consumers, and vice versa. 
 The underlying rationale is that price-sensitive consumers would reduce their 
consumption by a larger proportion if the manufacturers were to charge a uniform 
price. Because consumers in low-income countries on average have more elastic 
demand, the Ramsey optimal pricing rule implies that prices should be lower in 
lower-income countries, and vice versa. This is also consistent with a widely 
accepted view of equity that cross-national drug prices should reflect cross-national 
differences in ability to pay ( Reinhardt 2007 ). 
 Ramsey optimal pricing is very similar to the pricing rule adopted by a 
price-discriminating monopolist. Comparing price markups in equations 9.2 and 
9.5, the only difference is the term for the profit constraint  D . Thus, relative 
markups across countries are about the same under a profit-maximizing principle 
as under Ramsey pricing, but price levels may differ in absolute terms because the 
constrained profit may not be equal to the maximum profit. However, in the long 
run, entry and market competition may reduce the expected profits to normal levels 
at the margin. For this reason, price markups over marginal cost set by a profit-
maximizing firm with some market power approximate Ramsey prices in the 
long run. 
 Empirical Evidence on Ramsey Pricing of Pharmaceuticals 
 Taking income as a proxy for the price elasticity of demand (elasticity falls with 
increases in income), Ramsey pricing predicts a positive relationship between the 
pharmaceutical price level and per capita income.  Danzon and Furukawa (2003 ) 
tested this hypothesis by comparing mean price levels for pharmaceuticals in nine 

400 
 Part II / Chapter 9
countries: Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the 
United States. They used the  “ molecule-indication ”  as the unit of analysis and 
compared manufacturers ’ prices instead of retail prices in order to exclude the 
effect of wholesale pricing, retail markups, and taxes on cross-national price dif-
ferences. They first calculated overall price indexes relative to US prices for the 
eight other countries. Foreign prices are lower (higher) than US prices if index 
values are less (greater) than 100. The authors computed price indexes ranging 
from 67 for Canada to 127 for Japan (  table 9.5 ), which implies that Canada ’ s prices 
are 33 percent lower than those in the United States and Japan ’ s prices are 27 
percent higher than US prices. They then normalized the overall price indexes by 
income. That is, the overall price index is divided by the ratio of GDP per capita 
to US GDP per capita (GDP normalized to US level).  
 Price indexes relative to GDP per capita population ranged from 93 to 141 
among six high-income countries. By contrast, the value of the price indexes nor-
malized by income was greater than 500 for two middle-income countries. This 
suggests that price differentials were correlated with income within the high-
income countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the United 
States), but this relationship did not hold within the middle-income countries

(Chile and Mexico). Therefore, the prediction of Ramsey optimal pricing is only 
partially supported by the evidence obtained from high-income countries — drug 
price differentials among high-income countries being roughly proportional to 
income differentials. Cross-national price differentials among a wide range of 
countries with different income levels appear to deviate substantially from what 
might be expected from Ramsey pricing. 
 There are two plausible explanations for the weak relationship between per 
capita GDP and pharmaceutical prices. First, as discussed above, the threats of 
parallel trade and external referencing make the range of sustainable price differ-
entials smaller than they would be absent these phenomena. Thus, manufacturers 
are reluctant to grant a relatively lower price to low- and middle-income countries. 
Many manufacturers prefer to choose the strategy of delaying the launch or not 
launching at all if the price is considered by manufacturers to be too low. Second, 
there is a highly unequal distribution of income in some low- and middle-income 
countries, which in turn creates market segments within countries. Hence, a small 
but high-income subgroup dominates potential pharmaceutical sales. With support 
from the market of the high-income subgroup, the pharmaceutical manufacturers 
tend to charge a higher price, one that is unaffordable to other segments of the 
population and incompatible with the mean per capita income of these countries 
( Danzon and Towse 2003 ). 
 The weak relationship between cross-national price differentials and global 
income differences implies there is a welfare loss for consumers in low-income 
countries. Consumers in low-income countries either face an unaffordable price or 
a delay in the launch of new drugs, or even no launch at all. Therefore, increasing 
price differentials among countries potentially could substantially improve access 
to drugs in such countries. However, a sustainable, broad-based differential pricing 
structure is possible only if high-income countries forgo the temptation to engage 
in parallel trade and external referencing.

 Developing New Drugs: Rare Diseases and 
Diseases Prevalent in Low-Income Countries 
 Rewards as a Substitute for Patents: Overview 
 As mentioned above, firms ’ decision rule for deciding on R & D investment is based 
on profit maximization, not maximizing health gains; the allocation of resources 
to investments in R & D by pharmaceutical companies is guided by market demand 
(or ability to pay) rather than by health needs. In high-income countries, people 
are able and willing to pay more for good health than are those in middle- and 
low-income countries. For this reason, R & D expenditures are highly concentrated 
on prescription drugs that people in high-income countries demand. 

402 
 Part II / Chapter 9
 By contrast, there is a substantial disparity between ability to pay and unreal-
ized health benefits in lower-income countries. In such countries, not only is 
income low, but effective demand for disease prevention and therapy is also cor-
respondingly low. Consequently, R & D investments on diseases that are highly 
prevalent in such countries, such as tropical diseases, are low or even negligible. 
For example, new molecular entities (NMEs) for the treatment of tropical diseases 
in humans accounted for less than 1 percent of all NMEs licensed worldwide 
during 1975 – 1997( Kremer and Glennerster 2004 ). This suggests that a market 
mechanism based on the patent system may not generate a sufficient incentive for 
pharmaceutical innovation in some areas. The cause of this market failure is a 
maldistribution of income. 
 There is another type of market failure that can lead to suboptimal vaccine 
R & D investment arising from external benefits in consumption. The social benefits 
of vaccines include not only internal benefits from disease prevention accruing to 
individuals who are vaccinated but also external benefits from preventing the 
spread of disease to others. Individuals ’ maximum willingness to pay for vaccines 
plausibly does not reflect those external benefits. Vaccines for major communicable 
diseases may have much larger social benefits than many drugs. Pharmaceutical 
companies tend to earn lower profits from vaccines than from drugs. Companies 
thus have a lesser incentive to discover and develop new vaccines because of the 
relatively low profit, although their potential value to population health may be 
very high. 
 As a result of low income in many countries and the external benefits of vac-
cines, researchers have investigated other mechanisms to stimulate pharmaceutical 
innovation when the patent system fails. One promising alternative is a system of 
rewards paid by the government or private foundations (hereinafter referred as 
sponsors) to pharmaceutical firms. Under the reward system, the property rights 
of the innovation are purchased by the sponsors in the form of rewards; sponsors 
in turn place the innovation in the public domain, making it available freely to 
competing manufacturers. 
 One of the practical issues faced by the reward system is how to decide on 
the size of the rewards. Theoretically, the problem is rather straightforward. One 
could compute the consumer surplus, assuming pricing at marginal cost and at the 
output at which the demand curve intersects the marginal cost curve. This simple 
reward system gives a company with a new drug a subsidy in the amount of con-
sumer surplus from the sponsors as a reward to recoup its spending on R & D invest-
ment. The new pharmaceutical product in turn can be produced and sold in a 
competitive market by the innovator(s) at a competitive price. 
 Rewards have two advantages over patents. First, the sponsor can provide 
incentives for pharmaceutical R & D investment without granting the firms monop-
oly power over price and removing the legal barrier to entry to other firms. With 
rewards, new drugs can be sold at a price equal to marginal cost, which in turn 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 403
reduces the welfare loss from patents, increases the accessibility of new drugs, and 
reduces the cost burden on health insurers. Second, sponsors can select the mag-
nitude of research incentives by adjusting the level of rewards. For example, to the 
extent that there are consumption externalities, one would need to adjust for this 
since the consumer surplus as revealed by the market does not capture externali-
ties. The maximum price would be the area of the adjusted (for externalities) 
consumer surplus divided by the socially optimal output (again accounting for 
externalities). Based on these two advantages,  Shavell and Ypersele (2001)  con-
cluded that an optional rewards system, in which the firm can freely choose 
between rewards and patents, is superior to the patent system. 
 In practice, computing the maximum price or reward is more complex than 
this. For one,  Garber, Jones, and Romer (2006)  have cautioned that with insurance 
and moral hazard, the monopoly profit may exceed the relevant consumer surplus. 
The relevant surplus is calculated before insurance. Thus, it is conceivable that 
rewards to firms under the patent system are too high. 
 Also, the calculations involve new rather than existing products. Thus, many 
assumptions are required to obtain estimates of maximum prices or rewards. If 
rewards are set too low, incentives for innovation will be insufficient. However, 
there is also a risk that rewards may be set too high. If so, there will be too much 
investment in R & D ( Comanor 2007 ). 
 The following subsections analyze three proposals that use the reward 
system to provide incentives to develop new drugs and vaccines for developing 
countries. 
 Specific Proposals 
 Advance Purchase Commitments 
 Kremer and Glennerster (2004) have proposed using an advance purchase commit-
ment as an incentive to induce development of a malaria vaccine. The same 
approach is likely to be equally applicable as an incentive for promoting compa-
nies ’ investment in R & D on vaccines for other diseases highly prevalent in 
low-income countries or for pharmaceuticals designed for this purpose. This 
approach offers the innovator a subsidy of a fixed price per unit for a given number 
of units if the innovators develop a new vaccine that satisfies certain technical 
characteristics. 
 The rationale of this approach is to use the subsidy offered by the sponsors 
to close the gap between the high cost of investment in R & D for new vaccines and 
low ability to pay in low-income countries. Firms do not have an adequate incen-
tive to invest in vaccine R & D because the sustainable market price ( p ) is insuffi-
ciently high to allow it to recoup the R & D cost ( C ). If the sponsor offers a subsidy 
in the amount of  C / quantity  –  p per unit up to a certain quantity, then the total 
revenue received by the innovator equals the revenue from the market plus the 

404 
 Part II / Chapter 9
sponsor ’ s subsidy, which together with the subsidy may be sufficient to cover the 
cost of the investment in R & D. In sum, advance purchase commitments increase 
expected revenues from investments in R & D without limiting the role of patents. 
 A principal difficulty with advance purchase commitments, however, con-
cerns the sponsor ’ s need to specify the desired and feasible technical characteristics 
of a vaccine that has not yet been developed. This difficulty in turn creates two 
distortions in incentives for R & D investment ( Hollis 2007 ). First, firms lack incen-
tives to develop new products exceeding technical specifications set by sponsors. 
Therefore, it provides no incentive for a firm to conduct incremental innovation 
that could improve the quality of a new product over time. Second, sponsors run 
the risk of exhausting the funds available for subsidy if the technical standard is 
set too low. There would be too many products to subsidize. By contrast, the firm 
would have no incentive to develop the new product if the technical standard were 
set too high. If the sponsor were to allow some flexibility in interpreting the techni-
cal standard, the system would leave a great deal of discretion to members of the 
technical committee. This discretion in turn would make the subsidy program 
become committee- rather than market-driven. The funds for the subsidy would 
not be used in a socially optimal way as a consequence. 
 Optional Rewards Based on Therapeutic Effect 
 Hollis (2007 ) proposed an optional rewards system under which the pharmaceuti-
cal firm could choose between the reward and the patent system and the firm 
would be paid for pharmaceutical innovation directly by sponsors based on the 
therapeutic effectiveness of drugs if the firm opted for the reward system. This 
system explicitly links the profitability of drug innovations to their therapeutic 
impacts rather than to consumers ’ ability to pay. This payment scheme closes the 
gap between the pursuit of profit and the pursuit of better health and hence pro-
vides an incentive to channel R & D resources into the development of drugs with 
large potential health impacts rather than products demanded by relatively affluent 
persons. 
 Compared to advance purchase commitments, the advantage of the optional 
rewards system is that sponsors do not need to specify technical specifications in 
advance. Rather, sponsors need only evaluate therapeutic effectiveness after the 
new drugs have received regulatory approval. Therefore, the success of the optional 
rewards system lies in the details of implementation, such as whether or not there 
are valid and reliable measures of treatment effects and whether or not the com-
mitment of payment for innovative drugs is regarded as credible by the firms that 
do the investing. 
 Several countries have adopted various methods for comparing the costs of 
new drugs with their effects on health outcomes, a set of activities sometimes 
termed  economic evaluation . Although the methods have shortcomings and many 
practical issues remain, the international experience suggests that the process of 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 405
measuring therapeutic effect has proved workable, and to date, no country formally 
adopting economic evaluation has abandoned the policy. Although developing 
countries may have greater difficulty collecting data for measuring therapeutic 
effect than developed countries, there will inevitably be learning by doing. Some 
mistakes must be made for progress against some major diseases to be realized. 
Thus, the proposal for making rewards a function of both therapeutic impact and 
the number of persons affected is both a feasible and an efficient approach for 
inducing pharmaceutical innovation to combat diseases concentrated in low-
income countries (  box 9.2 ).  
 Box 9.2 
 The Health Impact Fund 
 Banerjee, Hollis, and Pogge (2010)  extended the concept of optional rewards into a 
practical system, the Health Impact Fund (HIF). The primary goal of the HIF is to 
solve the dilemma arising from the trade-off between  static efficiency  (increasing 
access to new drugs) and  dynamic efficiency  (preserving incentive for innovation). 
The HIF offers innovative pharmaceutical firms a choice between exercising their 
usual patent rights through high prices  or registering their product with the HIF. If a 
firm chooses option B, the plan would require the firm to sell its product worldwide 
at an administered price near the average cost of production and distribution, the 
break-even price ( p =  AC ), as in   figure 9.5 . In exchange, the firm would receive a 
stream of payments from the HIF based on the assessed global health impact of its 
drug. In other words, the HIF is an optional pay-for-performance scheme for new 
pharmaceuticals. Thus, the key issues for the real operation of the HIF are where the 
 “ pay ”  (funds) comes from and how to measure the  “ performance ” of a new drug. 
 According to  Banerjee, Hollis, and Pogge (2010) , funds for the HIF are to be pro-
vided by partner countries that agree to support it. They estimate that a reasonable 
starting level of funds would be US$6 billion per year. At this scale, the HIF could 
support the development of about two new drugs per year, sustaining a stock of about 
twenty medicines. Given the relatively large size of the funds, most countries are 
unable to institute the HIF single-handedly. Rather, international cooperation at the 
government level is an effective approach to set up the funds. They suggest that the 
founding partner states could begin the fund at a cost of 0.03 percent of their respec-
tive GDPs, given that a threshold participation of states represents about one-third of 
global income. 
 With regard to the measure of the performance, the HIF foresees offering firms a 
share of a fixed fund for each of 10 years, in proportion to the share of health impact 
of their registered product out of all registered products. For example, if all registered 
products were estimated to have saved twenty million  “ quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), a registered product that saved two million of those QALYs would receive 
10 percent of the fund (2/20).  

406 
 Part II / Chapter 9
 Priority Review Voucher 
 Ridley, Grabowski, and Moe (2006 ) proposed a reward system under which firms 
would receive a  “ priority review voucher ” if they successfully developed new 
drugs for treating diseases concentrated in low-income countries. The voucher 
would transferable and would give a privilege to the bearer of the voucher to use 
the priority review process in a new drug application for another drug. Compared 
to the standard review process, the priority review process for NDAs in the United 
States increases the effective patent life (EPL) by one year. The market value of a 
one-year increase in EPL for a  “ blockbuster drug, ” defined by the authors as a drug 
with annual sales exceeding $1 billion in its fifth year on the market, is approxi-
mately US$300 million. Thus, the voucher would generate substantial rewards to 
innovators, particularly if a market for the priority review voucher were to evolve. 
Then innovators could sell the voucher to other pharmaceutical firms that have 
the potential to develop a blockbuster drug. 
 The rationale behind this incentive scheme is to use the market mechanism 
in high-income countries to solve market failure in countries with lower incomes. 
By linking incentives in two different markets, this system provides benefits not 
only for lower-income countries but also for high-income countries. The drug that 
consumers and health insurers in high-income countries value more would reach 
the market sooner if the voucher market functioned well. Furthermore, the advan-
tage of the priority review voucher is that effective incentives for induced innova-
tion would not be limited by the amount of funds available to sponsors. Rather, 
the sponsor would rely on a market implemented in high-income countries to 
create incentives for pharmaceutical innovation in lower-income countries. The 
size of the reward would be determined by the market, instead of on the basis of 
the judgment of committee members or a cost-effectiveness analysis conducted by 
an outside advisory group. Both administrative and reward costs to sponsors (and 
taxpayers) would low, allowing this incentive scheme to be applied to a wider 
range of diseases than the two aforementioned incentive systems.

 Summary and Conclusions 
 This chapter has discussed several microeconomic decisions of pharmaceutical 
firms under the patent system, including R & D investment, pricing new products, 
competition between branded and generic products, advertising, and international 
pricing. We have also described how a reward system might be designed to foster 
pharmaceutical innovation when the patent system provides an insufficient incen-
tive for such innovation. 
 First, our analysis has shown that optimal investment R & D decisions by 
pharmaceutical companies are made by investing up to the point at which marginal 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
 407
returns from investment equal the marginal cost of capital. Governments can use 
various incentive designs affecting marginal revenue or the marginal cost of R & D 
investment to promote pharmaceutical innovation. 
 Second, the pricing of new drugs involves a trade-off between static and 
dynamic efficiency. In a pharmaceutical market not subject to price regulation, 
profit-maximizing pharmaceutical manufacturers set the prices of new products 
above their marginal costs, which allows the manufacturers to recoup the cost of 
their investment in R & D. Empirical evidence shows that the prices of new drug 
products primarily reflect marginal value, not the marginal cost of producing, 
packaging, and distributing drugs to consumers. 
 Third, after patent protection of a branded drug expires, the innovator faces 
competition from firms marketing generic drugs. Sellers of generic drugs adopt 
competitive product pricing to deter entry of other generic firms. However, firms 
selling branded products do not adopt this strategy to deter entry of generic prod-
ucts. Instead, the price of branded drugs may even rise after generic entry, even at 
the cost of the firm ’ s potentially losing substantial market share. Competition from 
generics has important effects on cost containment and pharmaceutical innovation. 
In an unregulated market, competition drives the price of generic products down, 
toward marginal cost. Thus, through generic competition, it is possible to achieve 
a good balance between static and dynamic efficiency. By contrast, in a regulated 
market, regulation undermines generic competition, which in turn has negative 
impacts on both the effectiveness of using generic substitution as a policy tool for 
achieving cost containment and incentives for innovation. 
 Fourth, pharmaceutical manufacturers have powerful incentives to spend 
resources on advertising. Such firms have spent a large share of promotion expen-
diture on detailing; in recent years, a small but increasing share of the promotion 
expenditure has been spent on direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA). The empiri-
cal evidence shows that both detailing and DTCA have significant positive effects 
on market demand, suggesting that demand for pharmaceuticals is responsive to 
advertising. 
 Fifth, pharmaceutical manufacturers have strong incentives to sell their prod-
ucts at different prices in different countries. This practice is beneficial to firms ’ 
profitability, as well as increasing consumer access to drugs. However, the cross-
national price differentials create an incentive for parallel trade and external ref-
erencing that serves to limit the size of price differentials that can be sustained. 
Cross-national price differentials of pharmaceuticals are relevant to a debated 
policy issue on how to share the global joint cost of R & D investments among 
countries. 
 A possible solution to this question is the concept of Ramsey optimal pricing, 
which implies that cross-national drug prices should reflect cross-national differ-
ences in ability to pay. The existing empirical evidence provides only weak support 
for this type of pattern, suggesting that the threat of parallel trade and external 

408 
 Part II / Chapter 9
reference pricing narrow the range of sustainable price differentials across coun-
tries, which in turn reduces consumer access to drugs in low-income countries. 
 Finally, we discussed the theoretical rationale and practical feasibility of 
using a rewards system to develop new vaccines, drugs for rare disease, and dis-
eases highly prevent in low-income countries. However, the specific proposals we 
have discussed are at present theoretical concepts rather than implemented payment 
schemes that have been subjected to rigorous empirical evaluation. By paying high 
prices in drugs prescribed for them, patents, especially in some high-income coun-
tries, will continue to do the heavy lifting in encouraging investments in R & D in 
the pharmaceutical sector for some time to come.

benefit will have any effect on the price elasticity of demand for prescription 
drugs by the US elderly? Will US pharmaceutical manufactures increase 
advertising intensity in response to this policy change?

generic competition. What are the major institutional factors that promote 
or undermine generic competition in your country?

tions hold in the pharmaceutical market? Why or why not? 
 9.7  
 What is parallel trade? What is the effect of parallel trade on the price dif-
ferentials of pharmaceutical products among countries if governments 
around the world do not ban parallel trade in the pharmaceutical market? 
Discuss the efficiency and equity implications of allowing parallel trade in 
pharmaceutical markets to flourish. 
 9.8  
 There is ample empirical evidence to show that on average, pharmaceutical 
prices in Canada are lower than those in the United States. Identify at least 
two important factors that cause price differentials between Canada and the 
United States. Do you think that the pharmaceutical manufacturers would 
lower the prices of pharmaceutical products in the United States if the 
Canadian government agreed to increase the reimbursement price of phar-
maceutical products in Canada? Explain your answer. 
 9.9  
 Assume that you live in a country that imposes strict price regulation on 
pharmaceutical products (e.g., Italy). Compared to the  “ average ” person in 
the United States, what are the benefits of drug consumption that you enjoy 
in your country? Do you think you should pay some  “ cost ” to realize such 
benefits? If so, which costs should you pay? 
 9.10  
 The World Trade Organization ’ s Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires all member countries to grant 

410 
 Part II / Chapter 9
and enforce 20-year patents on pharmaceutical innovations. Because most 
high-income countries already offered such protection, the main result of 
TRIPS has been to strengthen pharmaceutical patent rights in a group of 
low-income countries. Based on this chapter ’ s analysis, make theoretical 
predictions about the effects of TRIPS on the following: (1) R & D investment 
by pharmaceutical manufactures in high-income countries, (2) the prices of 
pharmaceutical products in low-income countries, and (3) cross-national 
differences in pharmaceutical prices. 
 Exercises 
 9.1  Suppose that the demand function of a pharmaceutical firm is  p = 20  – 0.5 x , 
where  p is the price of a prescription drug and  x is the number of prescription 
drugs demanded by patients. For simplicity, assume that the pharmaceutical firm 
can produce an extra pill at a constant cost, and hence the marginal cost function 
is  MC = 4. 
 a.  Compute the optimal price and quantity for the pharmaceutical firm if the firm 
receives patent protection from the government. 
 b.  Assuming that generic competition will drive down the price to marginal cost, 
compute the quantity of demanded for this product when the patent expires. 
 c.  Based on your answer, calculate the welfare loss that the patent system imposes 
on this product. 
 9.2  Suppose that a pharmaceutical firm receives approval for marketing a drug 
in country A and country B. The demand functions for this drug in countries A 
and B are  p = 84  – 2 x and  p = 124  – 3 x , respectively, where  p is the price of a 
prescription drug and  x is the quantity of the prescription drug demanded by 
patients. Assume that pharmaceutical markets in country A and country B are 
spatially separated and parallel trade is completely prohibited by the government. 
For simplicity, assume that there are no transportation costs and the marginal cost 
of producing an additional pill of drugs is constant at US$4, that is,  MC  = 4. 
 a.  Determine the optimal price for this pharmaceutical product in country A and 
country B if the firm seeks to maximize profit. 
 b.  Calculate the price elasticity of demand for drugs in country A and country B 
under such optimal pricing. 
 c.  Compare the relationship between the optimal price and the price elasticity 
between countries A and B. Is your result consistent with Ramsey optimal pricing?

 9.3   Use equation 9.1 to indicate which of the following prescription drugs are 
likely to receive relatively high advertising budgets from their parent pharmaceuti-
cal companies: Explain your answers. 
 
  new branded drugs for treating chronic disease; 
 
  new branded drugs for treating acute disease; 
 
  off-patent branded drugs for treating chronic disease; 
 
  generic drugs. 
 9.4   Use the framework in   figure 9.5  to show how to determine the optimal size 
of government reward that can preserve the same incentive for innovation as the 
patent system now has. Do you expect that the price and consumption of a specific 
pharmaceutical product would differ from that under the patent system if the gov-
ernment used the amount of the reward that you calculate to purchase the property 
right to a successful new pharmaceutical product from its pharmaceutical manu-
facturer inventor and make it freely available to competing manufacturers? Explain 
your answer. 
 9.5   Some researchers argue that pharmacogenomics (PG), which is the science 
of using genomic markers to predict drug response, can substantially reduce 
expected drug development costs through increasing the probability of technical 
success, requiring shorter clinical development times, and requiring smaller clini-
cal trials. Based on the analytic framework described by   figure 9.1 , what would 
you expect the impact of PG on R & D investment by pharmaceutical manufactures 
to be? 
 9.6   Suppose that a large pharmaceutical firm has the capacity to undertake six 
R & D investment projects, namely, projects A to E, and the expected marginal rates 
of return on these projects are 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2 percent, respectively. Assume 
that the size of the company ’ s investment does not affect its cost of capital and that 
the firm can finance the investment expenditure at an annual interest rate of 6 
percent with a long-term bank loan. 
 a.  Draw the COC (cost of capital) line and MEI (marginal efficiency of investment) 
lines on a graph with the number of R & D projects on the horizontal axis and 
the rates (COC, MEI) on the vertical axis. In how many R & D projects will the 
firm invest? 
 b.  If the government wants to use the industrial policy to bolster the economy and 
introduces a tax credit policy designed to reduce the cost of capital from 6 
percent to 4 percent, would a representative firm be likely to increase its invest-
ment in R & D? How many R & D projects would the firm undertake now? 

412

 c.  If the government imposes price regulation on all pharmaceutical products and 
this price regulation reduces the expected rate of return by 2 percent for every 
product, how many R & D projects would the firm undertake now?

 The Supply of Private Health 
Insurance 
 Having discussed the demand for private health insurance in chapter 4, we now turn 
to the supply of such insurance. Many countries have a private health insurance 
sector. However, the importance of this sector varies greatly among countries. 
 This chapter deals with these important issues related to supply. How do 
insurers reduce individuals ’ out-of-pocket health care expenditure risk? How do 
investments affect insurers ’ risk of insolvency and the premiums they charge? Why 
do underwriting cycles — cycles in premiums and in the availability of insurance 
coverage — arise in markets for insurance? Compared to other lines of insurance, 
how important are underwriting cycles in health insurance markets? Why is so 
much private health insurance in such countries as the United States provided 
through employment? And among employer-based insurance plans, why do so 
many employers self-insure? Why do insurers and self-insuring groups purchase 
reinsurance, and what forms does reinsurance take? What are the advantages and 
disadvantages of private provision of health insurance? What is the rationale for 
public regulation of private health insurance, and what forms does such regulation 
take? More specifically, what are the effects of government requirements that 
employers offer particular benefits as part of their insurance plans and, more gener-
ally, requirements that employers provide health insurance? What is meant by 
community rating of insurance premiums? What is the rationale for this practice? 
What are its likely effects? Why is private health insurance unlikely to provide 
coverage to all residents of a country, and what types of public policies may achieve 
universal health insurance coverage in a system built on private health insurance? 
What is meant by managed care and selective contracting? How does managed care 
compare with traditional insurance in terms of cost and quality?

 10.1 
 The ABCs of the Business of Insurance 
 Functions of Insurers 
 Insurers perform several fundamental functions. 
 Risk Bearing 
 First and foremost, insurers perform a risk-bearing function. During a year, one 
individual with health insurance coverage may have a hysterectomy, another may 
experience a heart attack, and still others may not use any medical care at all or 
very little of it because they remain healthy. A single individual can  “ diversify 
away ” some risk (eliminate some risk to him- or herself), such as investment risk 
(fluctuations in asset prices), by holding a well-balanced portfolio of equities, 
bonds, real estate, and other  “ alternative ”  investments (e.g., hedge funds). Thus, if 
values of shares on the stock market fall, the individual with a diversified asset 
portfolio can depend on the relative stability of the portfolio as a whole. People 
cannot diversify against all risk of fluctuations in their portfolios, but diversifica-
tion certainly helps. 
 The same individual cannot diversify away expenditure risk stemming from 
major adverse health events to self. One ’ s health, except for minor perturbations, 
is like holding one financial asset, not assets in a well-diversified portfolio. Yet by 
pooling  independent  risks, the risks of many individuals, insurers can diversify 
away losses accruing to individuals arising from adverse health events. 
 Many adverse events that individuals experience are likely to be independent 
of one another. When person A experiences a heart attack in a year, this has no 
impact on the probability that person B in another household will experience the 
same. (This is generally true of chronic but not acute infectious illnesses. In an 
epidemic, risks are correlated.) 
 If risks are completely independent, the risk per person in the pool of size  n 
is (1/ n ) multiplied by the variance in loss per insured. Thus, since  n is in the 
denominator of this expression for risk, per person risk declines as  n rises. However, 
if risks are correlated, the benefit of pooling is reduced in proportion to the extent 
of the correlation. There is not much to gain from pooling the risks of illness from 
an influenza epidemic that strikes many insured individuals in a locality at the 
same time, but in the twenty-first century, especially in high-income countries, 
such epidemics tend to be rare and account for a minor part of spending on per-
sonal health care services. 
 Similarly, there are opportunities for insurers that sell homeowner ’ s insur-
ance to diversify the risks of some mishaps, such as a fire in the kitchen or an old 
tree falling on a roof, but risk diversification becomes more problematic for insurers 
in the case of hurricanes or earthquakes, which are likely to affect many insured 
homes in a given locality or none at all. 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 419
 Some risks faced by health insurers are not easily diversified away, e.g., 
increases in prices insurers pay for personal health care services. If health insurers 
expect medical care prices to rise by 3 percent during the year and in actuality 
such prices rise four times as much, insurers would incur a loss. 
 However, fortunately, nondiversifiable risk tends to be less important in 
health insurance markets than in some other lines of insurance, for two reasons. 
First, the period being insured is typically only one year. Not much unanticipated 
inflation, for example, can generally occur within a year. Second, health insurers 
often negotiate rates of payment to physicians and hospitals in advance. Thus, even 
if physicians and hospitals were to raise their prices, these price increases would 
not apply to the health insurers, which have negotiated fixed fees for the duration 
of their contracts. 
 Nondiversifiable risk is a substantial problem in some other lines of insur-
ance, specifically those in which insurance claims arise from events occurring 
during a policy year but the losses payable under the terms of the insurance policy 
may actually be paid years later. Such is the case in lines of insurance with a long 
claims tail, such as medical malpractice insurance (see, e.g.,  Sloan and Chepke 
2008 ). Medical malpractice claims are often paid many years after the injury that 
led to the claim occurred, or even years after the claim was filed. By contrast, health 
insurance claims are filed immediately or almost immediately after the covered 
service is actually rendered. 
 A tool insurers employ for dealing with nondiversifiable risk is to purchase 
reinsurance. Essentially, the insurer ( “ primary insurer ” ) purchases insurance from 
another insurer to cover very large individual claims or to cover losses in the 
aggregate above some high dollar threshold. 
 Marketing and Underwriting 
 To acquire customers, insurers engage in marketing and underwriting. While mar-
keting serves to enlarge the pool of customers, underwriting entails assessing the 
probability that a potential customer will incur claims during a given year and 
setting the premium accordingly or, alternatively, deciding to reject the customer ’ s 
application for insurance coverage. It would seem logical that insurers would 
accept all comers and charge a premium to cover expected loss plus a competitively 
determined loading factor. However, in some cases, insurers may have difficulty 
assessing the frequency of claims the insured individual is likely to incur ex ante 
and, rather than run the risk of seriously underpricing the insurance policy, may 
decide to refuse to provide coverage to that individual. 
 One concern insurers have is that a person with a preexisting condition may 
demand large amounts of health insurance coverage because he or she predicts that 
he or she will be a high user of services in the near future. Such asymmetric 
information — the consumer knows more about future utilization than the insurer 
does — is called  adverse selection . Insurers often deal with adverse selection by 

420 
 Part II / Chapter 10
rejecting the person ’ s insurance application. Such practices have led to consider-
able political pressure in the United States to require that insurers take all comers, 
that is, everyone who applies for coverage. 
 Another concern relates to the high cost of marketing individual insurance 
plans and enrolling individuals in these plans. To reduce such marketing costs and 
improve consumer information about particular individual health insurance prod-
ucts, recent health reform in the United States calls for insurance exchanges to be 
implemented in the future (  box 10.1 ).  
 Claims Processing 
 Another function of insurers is to process claims. During the course of a year, a 
health insurer may process millions of health insurance claims. Health insurers 
 Box 10.1 
 What Are Health Insurance Exchanges? 
 Health insurance exchanges became a popular topic in the United States, following 
debate leading to passage of health insurance reform in the United States in 2010. In 
the United States, most private insurance is group-based, with the employer-based 
coverage being by far the predominant form of group health insurance coverage. 
 Compared to group coverage, individual health insurance coverage is quite expen-
sive. One reason for this is the cost of marketing health insurance policies to individu-
als and enrolling them in such plans, and often the lack of competition among 
insurers offering individual coverage. Although there are typically many insurers 
marketing products to individuals, premium and quality comparisons among insur-
ance products tends to be quite difficult. Consumer ignorance in turn confers market 
power on sellers of individual health insurance policies. 
 Health insurance exchanges, which are new organizational entities designed to 
create competitive insurance markets, serve several purposes (see, e.g.,  Kaiser Family 
Foundation 2009 ). First, they facilitate comparisons of plan characteristics by creating 
a classification system of plans. Characteristics of plans include cost-sharing provi-
sions, such as deductibles, coinsurance rates, co-pays, and out-of-pocket limits, that 
a policyholder can expect to spend in a given year, as well as lists of services covered 
by each plan. Second, in addition to presenting information on plan characteristics, 
exchanges provide information on plan performance, such as the availability of well-
ness programs and disease management program, and consumer satisfaction with 
plan administration. Third, exchanges assist with enrollment and with the applica-
tion of government subsidies for the purchase of insurance. Fourth, they can assist 
insured individuals in transitioning from one plan to another. Fifth, they can limit 
practices deemed undesirable that are subject to government regulation, such as 
denial of coverage due to a preexisting condition. 
 Exchanges are independent organizations that are governed by boards of directors. 
In the United States, they are to be implemented by 2014.  

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 421
are not unique in this regard. For example, motor vehicle insurers process many 
claims annually from accidents incurred by the persons they insure. 
 Loss Prevention 
 In addition, insurers engage in loss prevention to varying degrees. Such activities 
include negotiating contract terms, most important the prices of services paid to 
health care providers, and monitoring utilization to reduce payments for services 
with low marginal benefit to insured individuals. Absent loss prevention, individu-
als with complete or nearly complete insurance may demand services that offer 
little or no benefit. Some insurers operate disease management programs that seek 
to promote prevention and screening in order to reduce rates of adverse health 
outcomes of chronic disease and the associated expense in future years. 
 For example, a disease management program for diabetes would promote 
control of blood sugar (blood glucose) levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol 
levels and the use of various forms of screening, such as of the eyes and the 
lower extremities (legs, feet), since these practices are known to lower the rates of 
diabetic complications and hence lower spending on treating these complications 
in later years. Insurers have a greater incentive to offer disease management pro-
grams when turnover rates of the people they insure are low. A low turnover rate 
permits the insurer to capture the financial returns from disease prevention and 
screening. 
 Measuring the Financial Strength of Insurers: An Insurer ’ s 
Income Statement and Balance Sheet 
 Income Statement 
 An insurance company ’ s income statement records its revenue, expenses, and 
profits (or losses) for a particular period, its fiscal year. In the context of insurance, 
there are essentially two revenue streams — revenue from the sale of insurance and 
revenue from investments. Expenses consist of payments to policyholders (or to 
the parties to which policyholders have contractual obligations, e.g., the physicians 
from whom policyholders have received services), other expenses attributable to 
processing individual claims and writing checks, and expenses for marketing, 
managing investments, and general overhead. The difference between total revenue 
and total expenses is total profit, sometimes termed  surplus  in insurance jargon. 
The core of the insurance business is assuming (or  underwriting ) the risk of uncer-
tain future events in exchange for a premium. 
 Underwriting profits are the difference between premiums and  paid losses 
and other expenses associated with the sale of insurance in a fiscal year. Premium 
income is invested from the time it is received to the time that payments for loss 
and other expenses are made. For health insurance, the difference between the time 
premiums are received and the time payments are made to providers on behalf of 
insured individuals is relatively short. 

422 
 Part II / Chapter 10
 Balance Sheet 
 A firm ’ s balance sheet lists assets, liabilities, and equity, the latter being the differ-
ence between assets and liabilities. Because of government regulation of insurer 
solvency and insurers ’ own decisions to avoid bankruptcy, insurers are generally 
very conservative investors. For this reason, a large part of an insurer ’ s asset port-
folio is invested in fixed income (interest-bearing) securities. 
 Also important to an insurer ’ s bottom line is its liabilities, which consist of 
its reserves on the insurance policies it issues. When an insurer issues an insurance 
policy, it incurs a dollar obligation that both prudence and law or regulation dictate 
must be backed by assets of corresponding size. Losses are incurred throughout the 
policy year, not on the date the premium is received (or day 1 of the policy year). 
With some exceptions, insurers do not know immediately that a loss has actually 
been incurred, although they are increasingly trying to keep abreast of losses as 
they are incurred. 
 There is a distinction between unearned and earned premiums. Premiums 
switch from  “ unearned ” to  “ earned ” as the policy year evolves. Earned refers to 
the part of the policy year that has passed. Since that part of the policy year has 
elapsed, for earned premiums, there is a loss — either a loss the insurer has knowl-
edge of or does not have knowledge of. Corresponding to these are two types of 
loss, reserves incurred but not reported (IBNR) and case reserves. 
 As its name suggests, IBNR reserves are established to cover losses that have 
occurred but have not yet been reported to the insurer (e.g., a policyholder made 
a visit to physician but the claim has not yet been filed). Once the report is made 
and the insurer has determined the most likely loss from the specific claim, some 
part of IBNR reserves converts to a case reserve on that claim. The case reserve 
reflects the insurer ’ s best estimate of the loss that will ultimately result from that 
claim. The case reserve or, equivalently, the anticipated loss on the claim is not 
set in stone; rather, it is adjusted up or down periodically as new information 
pertinent to the claim is revealed to the insurer. 
 Insurers ’ Cash Flow, Income from Investments, and Premium 
Setting 
 Timing of Insurers ’ Revenue and Expenses 
 Insurers collect premiums in advance of paying losses. The time that elapses 
between the date premiums are collected and the date that losses are paid to poli-
cyholders differs appreciably by the line of insurance. The lag is short in such lines 
as health, homeowners ’ , motor vehicle, and term life insurance. It is long in some 
lines of liability insurance, including medical malpractice insurance, and in whole 
life insurance. 
 Between the time premium income is received and losses are paid, the insurer 
invests premium income, which yields a second type of income flow to the insurer, 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance

investment income. A longer lag between premium collection and loss payout 
allows the insurer to make more money from investments. 
 Investment Income 
 Insurers derive income from both underwriting and investments. Investments can 
help the insurer diversify away risk to the extent that underwriting losses are 
uncorrelated with investment returns. For some risks, for example, losses from 
work-related injuries and illnesses covered by workers ’ compensation, claims for 
disability under workers ’ compensation policies may be higher during recessions 
when investment returns are depressed. This seems less likely for health insurance, 
although to our knowledge there are no formal studies of this issue. 
 Higher Investment Income Leads to Lower Premiums on the Underwriting Side 
of an Insurer ’ s Business 
 Premiums are set based on forecasts of future losses from insurance written in a 
particular policy year, an adjustment for risk, the claims tail, and the anticipated 
returns to be earned on investments from the premium funds collected for the 
policy year, as well as market factors. Because it can earn investment return on 
premiums, the insurer can charge a premium that is below the anticipated loss on 
the insurance policy. Higher risk tends to result in higher premiums. A longer tail 
and higher  anticipated investment returns tend to result in lower premiums, and 
conversely. When an insurer computes a premium for a future period, it does take 
into account expected returns from investing money it collects from premiums that 
it will retain until payments on losses are made. The potential return is positively 
related to the length of the time period that elapses from the date the claim is filed 
until payment is actually made. 
 Investment income varies for two reasons: (1) rates of return on investments 
per year differ, and (2) the length of the time that premium income can be held in 
investments differs. In a competitive insurance market, the competitive process 
drives premiums to a level at which the marginal insurer can earn its cost of capital 
(the return it must pay its suppliers of capital) but no more. Thus, if rates of return 
on investments rise, other factors held constant, a dollar of premium income 
becomes more valuable for what it will bring to the insurer in terms of investment 
income. Thus, the competitive process drives premiums down to a level that yields 
a competitive rate of return on a dollar of investment in the insurance company. 
Premiums are expected to vary inversely with interest rates. When interest rates 
fall, which reduces the yield from investments, premiums rise to restore a competi-
tive return on investment, and conversely. The same principle applies to stock 
returns, but insurers tend to maintain asset portfolios that are not volatile, in part 
because of government regulation of insurer solvency. Also, in lines such as health 
insurance, the lag between premium collection and payment of losses is quite short, 

424 
 Part II / Chapter 10
a few months on average, which makes premiums relative insensitive to interest 
rate changes. 
 Other factors held constant, including annual rates of return on investments, 
premiums will be lower relative to anticipated losses paid to policyholders (under-
writing losses) and the longer the lag is between premium collection and loss 
payments, which for health insurance tends to be very short. One mistake some 
analysts of insurance markets frequently make is to attribute increased insurance 
premiums to poor investment returns. This is false reasoning. When considering 
returns on investments, insurance companies are forward — not backward — look-
ing. Forecasting future returns is fraught with uncertainty. Interest rates reflect 
many factors, including inflationary expectations and monetary policies of central 
banks. 
 In a competitive insurance market, no one should be willing to pay a higher 
premium to a company just to allow the company to recover losses from errors it 
made in past investments. If one insurer is a poor manager of its investments, 
another insurer with sound investments can enter the market and successfully gain 
business from the poor insurer/investor. Insurance is inherently forward-looking, 
with respect to both expected losses from policyholders on the underwriting side 
and expected gains from investments on the investment side of its business. 
 Reinsurance 
 Some premiums from a primary health insurer (the insurer that sells insurance to 
policyholders) may be ceded to a reinsurer. In this transaction, a primary insurer 
exchanges money (pays a premium) for a promise by the reinsurer to cover a spe-
cific expense, should the criteria for payment in the contract warrant this. Reinsur-
ance is insurance for the primary insurer, or in the case of health insurance an 
employer often self-insures for the insurance provided to its employees but pur-
chases reinsurance to cover unusually high losses. By reinsuring, the primary 
insurer reduces its liabilities and its risk of insolvency, but it sacrifices some 
revenue in return. 
 There are three common types of reinsurance contracts: quota share, aggregate 
stop-loss, and excess-of-loss reinsurance (see, e.g.,  Swartz 2006 , 104 – 105). Under 
quota share reinsurance, the reinsurer is paid a share of the premium collected in 
exchange for assuming a share of the losses. Under aggregate stop-loss reinsurance, 
reinsurance covers amounts above a threshold of aggregate loss incurred by the 
insurer during a policy year. Excess-of-loss reinsurance covers amounts above a 
threshold of the loss incurred by an individual insured. 
 Reinsurance is typically sold in layers of coverage for a specified range of 
losses. For example, under an excess-of-loss arrangement, the primary insurer 
might cover the first $100,000 of loss incurred by a single policyholder in a year, 
with the first layer of reinsurance being for the next $100,000 of loss and another 
layer being for over $200,000 to $1 million, and so on. 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 425
 Underwriting Cycles 
 Private insurance markets have been subject to boom-and-bust cycles, which are 
termed  “ insurance underwriting cycles ” ( Kipp, Cookson, and Mattie 2003 ;  Gross-
man and Ginsburg 2004 ). These cycles are characterized by a period in which 
insurers make profits, followed by a period of almost equal length during 
which insurers incur losses. Following the period of losses, premiums rise by more 
than losses increased, restoring profitability. 
 Several factors seem to explain cycles. First, premiums are set in advance of 
the period during which losses are realized. Loss projection is an imprecise process. 
Second, when profitable, there is insurer entry. In seeking to gain a foothold, 
entrants often underprice insurance. This leads to price cuts by incumbent firms, 
which also underprice. Third, solvency regulation may be partly responsible for 
the cycles. Regulatory agencies require that insurers maintain a minimum surplus. 
This may lead to overpricing in anticipation of low investment yields. High prices 
in turn attract entrants. Substantial premium increases may lead to demand for 
public policy makers to  “ do something ” about the rising price of insurance. 
 10.2 
 Are Insurers ’ Premiums and Returns 
Excessive? 
 Especially when insurance premiums rise, there is often a search for the  “ culprit. ” 
Often, in such situations, there are widespread complaints that  “ big ”  insurance 
companies earn excessive profits. Indeed, health care is costly, but such cost is also 
high for insurers. Unfortunately, there are no rigorous studies of whether or not 
premiums or returns accruing to private insurers are excessive or not. However, it 
is useful nevertheless to consider in general terms how one would conduct such 
an assessment. 
 In chapter 4, we stated that the premium equals the sum of the loading 
and the expected loss on an insurance policy. In this chapter, we have added a 
complication — namely, that premium income is typically collected before 
losses are paid. In the interim, insurers can earn investment income. As returns 
on investments rise and the length of the time elapsed between receipt of the 
premium and payment for losses increases, premiums fall in a competitive insur-
ance market. 
 Premiums may be excessive if (1) losses are excessive and (2) returns are 
excessive relative to the risk borne by insurers. Losses may be excessive if insurers 
engage in suboptimal amounts of loss prevention or are not effective in negotiating 
prices with physicians and hospitals. Optimal loss prevention occurs at the margin 
at which a dollar of expenditure on loss prevention yields a dollar saving in losses. 
If the saving is more than a dollar, such expenditure is too low, and conversely. 

426 
 Part II / Chapter 10
 Insurers may not be tough negotiators for at least two reasons. First, in the 
United States, historically hospital and physician associations established non-
profit insurance companies (Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans) and hospital offi-
cials and physicians were members of their boards of directors ( Adamache and 
Sloan 1983 ;  Pauly 1998 ). When formed, all Blue Cross Blue Shield plans were 
nonprofit. In the last few years, many Blue plans have converted to for-profit status, 
and this is no longer the case. Second, when there is only one hospital in a market 
area with which to negotiate, insurers may be ill positioned to obtain favorable 
terms from hospitals. This may be particularly true when insurers have to negotiate 
with a single physician-hospital organization (PHO) in a community (see chapter 
6). Antitrust policy may be (and has been) used to ensure that negotiations are 
arm ’ s length. 
 The issue of whether or not profits are excessive is more complex. Under 
competition, market forces drive returns down to the point at which the marginal 
rate of return on a company ’ s investments equals the marginal cost of capital. Since 
investors must be compensated for risk bearing by receiving a higher rate of return 
on their investments, the cost of capital is correspondingly higher for riskier invest-
ments. In particular, the finance literature distinguishes between diversifiable and 
nondiversifiable risk. At the most basic level, insurers diversify the risk of loss by 
pooling uncorrelated risks of individual insureds. By pooling, what is a risk of loss 
to an individual is a much smaller risk to the pool. In any period, most insureds 
are fortunate not to incur losses. Others are not so fortunate and incur losses. If 
individual losses are uncorrelated, risk pooling diversifies away much of the 
 “ underwriting risk ” (risk on the insurance line of business) of individual losses. 
Similarly, as already noted, insurers can diversify investment risk by holding a mix 
of different types of assets. 
 The insurer ’ s cost of capital reflects (1) the rate of return on a risk-free asset, 
such as a short-term government bond (e.g., a 90-day US Treasury bill), and (2) a 
return to nondiversifiable risk. A major potential source of nondiversifiable risk to 
a health insurance is adverse selection. If people with certain characteristics such 
that they think they will be heavy users in the next year systematically select insur-
ance plans with certain characteristics, for example, relatively complete coverage, 
then losses will be correlated. Or a breakthrough technology may be welcomed by 
insured patients because of the health benefit it confers, yet it may affect treatment 
patterns for many insureds with a particular condition. 
 Technological change is not as important a source of nondiversifiable risk for 
health insurance as it may be in other lines of insurance in which the claims tail 
is much longer. Health insurers can estimate the likely effect of an innovation on 
expenditures they will incur during the following policy year. 
 In the insurance industry, as in banking, there is a public policy concern 
about the effect of insolvency on the firm ’ s customers, in this context, the insurer ’ s 
policyholders ( Munch and Smallwood 1980 ;  Winter 1991 ;  Born 2001 ). There is a 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 427
public interest in protecting consumers from the risk of having paid a premium, 
becoming ill and using personal health services, and then learning that the insurer 
is insolvent. For this reason, there are laws and regulations designed to reduce 
insurance company bankruptcy risk. The total risk of an insurer ’ s portfolio affects 
the likelihood that it will become insolvent. Bankruptcy risk is reduced when 
insurers hold additional retained earnings (surplus) as a precaution against short-
falls. Another safeguard is reinsurance. However, reinsurance is highly experience 
rated. An insurer that uses its reinsurance will typically pay higher reinsurance 
premiums in the future. Insurers may take precautions to avoid bankruptcy volun-
tarily. The rationale for solvency regulation of insurers, however, is that these 
voluntary efforts may be insufficient, and some public oversight of individual 
insurers is desirable. 
 10.3 
 Private versus Public Provision of Health 
Insurance Coverage 
 Individuals ’  willingness to pay amounts above the policyholder ’ s expected loss —
 either from a premium that reflects more than expected loss or by investment 
returns that accrue from the time premiums are paid and the time losses are paid —
 allows a market for private insurance to exist. Despite widespread moral hazard 
and adverse selection, insurance generally is available. In many countries, most 
coverage is provided by public insurance, with private health insurance being an 
add-on or supplement to public coverage. As a supplement, private health insur-
ance covers services not covered by the public plan or provides coverage for a 
quality level not supported by the public plan, such as a better hospital room. In 
most countries, insurance for nursing home stays and other long-term care services 
are not covered by public insurance. There may be private markets for such cover-
age in such cases. 
 Among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
member countries, the United States is the only country in which a large share of 
the population mainly relies on private health insurance coverage. Only for persons 
over the age of 65 is there universal public coverage in the United States, under 
the Medicare program. And there is private supplemental health insurance cover-
age to cover cost sharing that Medicare imposes on beneficiaries, as well as services 
not covered by Medicare. 
 Most, but certainly not all, countries that are members of the OECD are high-
income countries. Among OECD members in 2005, the share of total expenditure 
on health services financed by private health insurance was by far the highest for 
the United States — 36.4 percent (  table 10.1 ). The second to fourth highest private 
insurance shares were for the Netherlands (19.4percent), Canada (12.7 percent),

and France (12.7 percent), with Germany and Switzerland close behind. Among 
OECD countries, Iceland, the Czech Republic, and Norway did not have private 
health insurance or insurance from other private funds.  
 Figure 10.1  shows the relationship between the share of health expenditures 
financed by out-of-pocket payment and by private health insurance. It suggests that 
the share of health expenditures financed by out-of-pocket payments is not neces-
sarily highest where the private health insurance share is the highest. For example, 
in Mexico, consumers bore a greater than 50 percent out-of-pocket share of personal 
health expenditures in 2005, and private health insurance accounted for only 3 
percent of health expenditures. In Switzerland, the out-of-pocket share was about 
30 percent in that year, and private health insurance accounted for only 9 percent 
of health care expenditures in that country.  
 The Case for and against Relying on Private Health Insurance 
for Provision of Coverage to a Population 
 Advocates of private health insurance systems make several arguments.  1 First and 
foremost, because private health insurers face a profit motive, they have a greater 
incentive to be responsive to policyholders than do managers of publicly financed 
systems. This type of responsiveness may take many forms. For example, if con-
sumers are willing to pay for a new technology, private insurers should be willing

to provide such additional coverage, although at a higher premium. Although they 
pay a higher premium, consumers are presumably better off by having access to a 
service that they value. By contrast, concerned with cost containment and being 
less responsive to consumers, and having monopsony power in health care markets 
(i.e., public insurers are in a position to dictate the prices they pay to hospitals, 
physicians, and other health care providers), public insurers may be less inclined 
to provide coverage for new technologies. This may serve as an important impedi-
ment to innovation. Also, in a public system, issues of what services to cover can 
become highly politicized. In the private sector, by contrast, coverage issues are 
private concerns. Private health insurers seem more likely to cover new technolo-
gies that they believe their customers will value. 
 There is an important difference between  static  and  dynamic   efficiency  (see 
chapter 9). If potential innovators become convinced that their new products will 
not be purchased, or will be purchased reluctantly and with a lag at prices that do 
not cover their cost of research and development, they will be less likely to bring 
innovative products to market. 
 In a competitive insurance market, insurers know they must provide value 
for the premium dollar or lose market share to their competitors. For this reason, 
they may be expected to be tough in negotiating contracts with health care provid-
ers. Inefficiency in health care provision must result in higher premiums. If private 
health insurers tolerate inefficiency on the part of providers and their competitors 
are not equally tolerant of such inefficiency, insurers stand to lose market share. 
 Second, given that people have different preferences, not only for risk but 
also for the types of services they value and hence want to have included in a 
benefit package, private health insurers can offer products that reflect this hetero-
geneity in preferences. When benefit structure is decided collectively and publicly, 
as a practical matter, it becomes more difficult to allow for such heterogeneity. 
 Third, the provision of public and of private health insurance are not mutu-
ally exclusive. For example, in the United States, Medicaid and particularly Medi-
care have contracted with private health maintenance organizations for provision 
of care to some persons enrolled in the Medicare program. 
 Despite these advantages of private health insurance, it has many critics as 
well. What proponents of private insurance view as advantages, some opponents 
see as disadvantages. 
 There is an argument that private insurance is not superior to public insur-
ance in satisfying consumer preferences. For one, most health insurance in the 
country with the largest private sector, the United States, is provided on a group 
basis. While the provisions of group health insurance plans may satisfy the median 
employee ’ s preferences (see  Goldstein and Pauly 1976 ), it is clearly difficult for 
group plans to satisfy individual employee preferences. Also, some differences in 
preferences may reflect adverse selection on the part of potential policyholders. 
Private health plans implement various restrictions to guard against adverse 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 431
selection, including implementing preexisting condition clauses, which disallow 
coverage for services for conditions that existed at the time the person joined the 
health plan, or they fail to renew insurance policies if the person incurred consid-
erable expense during the policy year, or premiums are raised to the extent that 
they are unaffordable to the policyholder. 
 As for private health insurance that supplements public health insurance 
coverage, there is the argument that private insurers free ride on the public plans. 
They potentially do this when they cover public plans ’ deductibles, coinsurance, 
and co-pays. Imposing cost sharing reduces the quantity of personal health services 
demanded (see chapter 3). Thus, eliminating or reducing cost sharing may be 
expected to increase outlays not only for the private supplemental plan but for the 
public plan as well. 
 The critics have additional arguments against the private provision of health 
insurance. Private health insurance is inefficient when measured in terms of 
administrative expense, which is much higher in the United States than in Canada, 
a country reliant on public health insurance (see, e.g.,  Woolhandler and Himmel-
stein 1991, 1997 ;  Woolhandler, Campbell, and Himmelstein 2003 ). If such admin-
istrative cost could be eliminated or at least reduced, the savings could presumably 
be reallocated to the direct provision of personal health care services. Administra-
tive expenses are incurred by both insurers and providers. Private insurers bear 
the costs of marketing and enrolling persons in their plans, particularly if no public 
coverage under the public insurance program is universal. Given high rates of 
turnover — many people switch private insurers annually — insurers constantly 
incur costs of enrollment. 
 In addition, by providing preventive services and actively managing chronic 
diseases, there are long-term savings in expenditures on personal health care ser-
vices to be realized. Because of all the churning of enrollees, health insurers do 
not devote a socially optimal amount of resources to disease prevention and man-
agement. Given the large number of insurers, it is difficult to track persons through 
the system. This leads to uncoordinated care and unnecessary testing, since medical 
information systems are not integrated. 
 Private insurers engage in some marketing practices that are widely viewed 
as contrary to the public interest. For example, persons with prior adverse health 
experience may be refused coverage. This is often viewed as unfair in that at least 
some adverse health experience cannot be helped. After all, one does not select 
one ’ s parents. 
 Insurers engage in the practice of  “ cream skimming ” in the context of health 
insurance, enrolling the healthy and rejecting those who are not so healthy. Insur-
ance contracts tend to be complex, making it difficult for consumers to compare 
contracts on premiums versus coverage provided by each insurance policy. 
 Finally, there is concern about the consolidation of health insurers in 
the United States and its implications for competition ( Robinson 2004 ). In most 

432 
 Part II / Chapter 10
states in 2002 – 2003, market concentration was at a level that would elicit concern 
by public agencies charged with antitrust monitoring and enforcement. Although 
market concentration is not a sufficient condition for exercise of market power, 
it facilitates the exercise of market power ( Hyman and Kovacic 2004 ). As dis-
cussed more fully below, in the United States, private insurance tends to be 
employer-based. Although there are efficiencies in employer-based coverage, there 
are also inefficiencies. Perhaps most important, there is the phenomenon of  “ job 
lock ” ( Gruber and Madrian 1994 ;  Madrian 1994 ). People who have a major illness 
in the family may be reluctant to change employers, even if they would be more 
productive in the alternative employment setting, because they may have to 
undergo a waiting period before benefits from the new employer take effect or 
otherwise. This introduces inefficiency into the operation of labor markets. There 
is an impediment to optimal matching of people to jobs in which they have a 
comparative advantage. 
 The case for and against private health insurance in the countries other than 
the United States are different from the United States in the sense that private 
health insurance in these other countries may tend to serve more as a political 
safety value, allowing more affluent citizens to obtain another tier of care, than as 
a vehicle for promoting efficiency in health services provision and for promoting 
technological change. 
 10.4 
 Employer-Based Private Health Insurance 
Coverage 
 Advantages of Employer-Based Coverage 
 In the United States, private health insurance coverage is primarily obtained 
through one ’ s place of employment. Employer-based coverage is much more wide-
spread than is individual private health insurance coverage for several reasons. 
First and foremost are the economies of scale in provision. It is much less expensive 
on a per-insured basis to provide insurance in large groups since marketing and 
enrollment costs per insured are substantially reduced in such settings, as is claims 
processing, to a perhaps lesser extent (  table 10.2 ). Insofar as the risk falls as the 
number of persons in the insuring group increases, employers with fewer than 200 
employees rarely self-insure ( Swartz 2006 , 68).  
 Second, insurance provided through the employer mitigates the problem of 
adverse selection (but at the same time makes insurance less responsive to indi-
vidual preferences of employees within an employment group), particularly in 
large employer groups. Most employees select their employer for a number of 
reasons, including pay, working conditions, opportunities for career advancement, 
vacation, and fringe benefits, of which health insurance is only one. An important 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 433
rationale for public insurance as well is to avoid adverse selection problems that 
may exist in private health insurance markets. 
 Third, in the United States, employer-provided self-insured (by the employer) 
private health insurance is subject to federal, not state, laws — more specifically the 
federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Thus, state 
insurance laws, such as those mandating that certain services be covered by 
all insurance policies sold in the state, do not apply to employer-based coverage. 
A mandated benefit might require inclusion of chiropractic services or home health 
care in the benefit package. To the extent that an insured person does not value or 
expect to use such services, the mandate effectively amounts to a premium increase. 
We return to the issue of health insurance regulation later in this chapter. 
 The provision of health insurance through employment is highly advanta-
geous to employees and their families in the United States since contributions 
made on behalf of the employee by the employer are not subject to either state or 
federal corporate or personal income tax. For persons in high marginal personal 
income tax brackets, this tax subsidy is particularly advantageous. For such persons, 
it may be rational to demand that even routine health care services be included in 
the benefit package since the value of the tax subsidy is likely to exceed the loading 
factor, especially if the person works for a large employer. 
 Typically, larger employers in the United States self-insure for payments 
made on behalf of employees for health services, but pay insurers for administering 
the insurance plan. Such employers tend to be sufficiently large to permit an ample 
amount of risk diversification. However, since the vast majority of employers are 
in a business other than insurance, they prefer to have private health insurers who 
are specialists in the health insurance business process and pay claims and negoti-
ate with individual physicians and hospitals over contract terms than to perform 
these functions themselves.

 Who Really Pays for Employer-Based Health Insurance 
Coverage? 
 Health insurance is only one of several types of fringe benefits that employers 
provide. The most important other fringe benefit is retirement benefits. But 
employers also offer educational benefits, paid vacation time, and paid sick 
days. 
 Employers and others argue that employer-provided health insurance cover-
age places a heavy burden on employers, especially in recent years, in light of the 
substantial increase in per employee cost of such coverage. There are statements 
to the effect that there is more health insurance in an automobile produced in the 
United States than there is steel. As a result, advocates for manufacturers and some 
media pundits have argued that US manufacturers are placed at a competitive 
disadvantage versus their competitors in other countries with large public health 
insurance systems. 
 This raises a fundamental question. When health insurance is provided 
through employment, who pays? The employee? The employer? Or some combina-
tion of the two? About one matter there is no debate: in a country like the United 
States, in which there is a substantial tax subsidy of private health insurance pre-
miums, the public pays for the tax subsidy in some way, certainly through higher 
tax rates on a narrower tax base than it otherwise would pay. 
 The matter of whether the employer or the employee pays for health insur-
ance provided through employment is a controversial issue, pitting the economists ’ 
view against the view of the public at large, including employers. 
 To see the economist ’ s argument, which is that the employee ultimately pays 
for health insurance through reduced compensation in other forms, we assume 
initially, as is plausible for most employees, that the employee values both health 
insurance benefits and earnings. The latter allows the employee to purchase goods 
and services other than health care (  fig. 10.2 ). Because both other consumption and 
health insurance are  “ goods, ” the indifference curve for each worker has the nega-
tive slope it does. 
 The employer is indifferent between paying a dollar in health insurance 
benefits or a dollar in wage income. Thus, the isoprofit curve  π 0 (constant level of 
profit) is linear with a negative slope of  – 1 since both other goods and services are 
denominated in dollars. If the health insurance benefit were to increase by $500, 
wage compensation would have to decline by $500 so that a constant level of profit 
was maintained. At point  M , the slope of worker A ’ s indifference curve and the 
slope of the isoprofit curve are tangent, and worker A chooses to be paid  H A in 
health insurance benefits and  w A in wage compensation. By contrast, worker B has 
a lower marginal valuation of health insurance as a fringe benefit and chooses to 
receive his entire compensation in the form of wages at  w B . Worker C is more pro-
ductive than workers A and B. He generates an isoprofit of  π 1 . His wage-health 
insurance compensation package is located at point  N .  

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 435
 Now, if the median employee is like worker B, then the employer pays a 
higher wage and does not offer health insurance. If the median employee is like 
worker A, the wage is lower and health insurance is provided. An important regu-
lation governing the provision of private health insurance as a fringe benefit in the 
United States is that all full-time employees in a firm must be offered the same 
health insurance benefit. Thus, at present, no insurance may be provided if many 
of the employees are of type B, but insurance would be provided if employees are 
of type A. In reality, employees of a given firm are likely to have heterogeneous 
preferences for wage income versus fringe benefits, including health insurance. 
 One reason is that some employees have spouses who receive private health 
insurance in the family through his or her job. Insurers coordinate benefits. This 
means if one ’ s spouse ’ s insurance covers a physician visit, there is no benefit from 
having one ’ s own policy cover it. We have little understanding of how the choice 
of plan offerings is done in practice. One study ( Goldstein and Pauly 1976 ) devel-
oped a model to explain this choice. 
 From the underlying microeconomic theory, we would expect that in a com-
petitive labor market, there would be a negative relationship between (1) the

provision of an insurance benefit with employment, and the generosity of such 
benefits if provided, and (2) the wage rate the individual employee receives. 
However, empirical research has found a positive, not a negative, relationship 
between wage compensation and compensation in the form of health insurance 
benefits ( Currie and Madrian 1999 ;  Pauly 2001 ). A reason for the positive correla-
tion is that employees who have health insurance through their place of employ-
ment have certain unmeasured characteristics that those employees who lack 
employer-based insurance do not have. Possibly employees who have health insur-
ance are more motivated workers than those who lack insurance, or perhaps they 
have skills not explicitly measured in the empirical studies . For example, worker 
C in   figure 10.2  may be more productive for these reasons than worker B is. But 
 w B is less than  w C , although the person has health insurance. 
 In other words, in empirical analysis, to gauge the impact of the provision of 
employer-based health insurance on wages paid employees, the researcher would 
like to compare compensation patterns between workers A and B, who are equally 
productive, but unless the researcher takes specific precautions, he or she will 
compare worker C with workers A and B, the former being on a higher isoprofit 
line than the latter. Unlike for health insurance (the Health Insurance Experiment; 
see chapter 3), there are no randomized controlled trials of employee compensation 
patterns. Rather, researchers desiring to assess the impact of the provision of 
employer-based health insurance on wages must use observational data (see chapter 
3). These are data from firms that make various choices about the health insurance 
plans they offer their employees, not data emerging from the random assignment 
of health insurance plans to employers. Ideally, the researcher would be able to 
control for ability or productivity differences among individuals in the sample, but 
such differences, though observable to employers, are not easily observed by 
researchers. 
 An econometric solution is the use of instrumental variables. Assume that 
the dependent variable is the employee ’ s earnings. Among the explanatory vari-
ables is whether or not the employee has employer-provided health insurance.  2 
With the instrumental variables approach, the researcher selects a variable that is 
correlated with the endogenous explanatory variable but does not affect the depen-
dent variable in the main equation — in this application, earnings. One such (instru-
mental) variable is whether or not the employee ’ s  spouse has health insurance 
through his or her place of employment. If the employee can secure health insur-
ance through his or her spouse ’ s place of employment, the employee may not be 
nearly as interested in obtaining health insurance from his or her own employer. 
Rather, other factors about the job held constant, he or she will prefer a job that 
offers a higher wage but no health insurance since he or she has coverage through 
the spouse ’ s place of work. At the same time, the spouse ’ s health insurance cover-
age is plausibly unrelated to the worker ’ s ability or productivity (unless there is 
assortative mating — spouses who are productive in the marketplace may also have 
2.  An alternative 
ex planatory variable is 
the generosity of the 
health insurance 
benefit, but this adds 
complexity to our 
discussion without 
adding much 
additional insight.

spouses who are productive in this respect); thus, unmeasured ability or productiv-
ity should not affect the person ’ s wage. 
 Olson (2002 ), who used this instrumental variables approach, found that 
women whose husbands had employer-provided health insurance were less likely 
to be employed in jobs that provided health insurance as a fringe benefit. In par-
ticular, he found that the probability that a woman whose husband had health 
insurance through his job was 15.5 percentage points less likely to work at a job 
providing health insurance than women whose husbands did not obtain health 
insurance through their place of employment. Overall, wives with health insurance 
obtained through their own employers worked for a wage that was about 20 percent 
lower than what they would have received working at a job without such benefits.  3 
This result implies that workers in the United States pay a considerable amount 
for receiving private health insurance through their employers. 
 10.5 
 Government Regulation of Private Health 
Insurance 
 Rationale for Government Regulation 
 Regulation is an important feature of insurance markets of all types. In all countries 
in which private health insurance policies are sold, insurance is subject to various 
forms of regulation. Four major justifications are (1) to prevent bankruptcies by 
maintaining insurers ’ solvency, (2) to keep premiums at nearly actuarially fair rates 
by preventing insurers from exercising market power in setting premiums, (3) to 
ensure the availability of coverage by implementing laws and regulations to ensure 
availability, and (4) to supply information to insurance purchasers to improve the 
performance of insurance markets and ensure fair play. Such regulation applies to 
insurance plans that are marketed to consumers, not to employer-based, self-
insured health care plans. 
 Historically, the main role of insurance regulation was to ensure the solvency 
of insurers in advance of insurer bankruptcy and to mitigate the losses of policy-
holders in the event that bankruptcies occurred. Solvency regulation, the rationale 
for which has already been discussed, is less important in a line such as health 
insurance since the claims tail is lower than for other lines of insurance, such as 
medical malpractice insurance. If the claim is likely to be paid years after the 
premium is paid, insurer bankruptcy becomes a very important issue. Also, sol-
vency regulation does not apply to self-insured employment-based insurance plans. 
 The purpose of insurance is to mitigate a policyholder ’ s financial risk; thus, 
if and when an insurer goes bankrupt, in the end, the insured party has not really 
been relieved of any risk. Additionally, individual purchasers may have insuffi-
cient information, combined with too much complexity for consumers of insurance 
3.  For a more recent 
empirical application, 
see  Lehrer and Pereira 
(2007 ).

438 
 Part II / Chapter 10
to really know which insurers are less likely to become insolvent. Toward this end, 
regulators monitor whether premiums are adequate to cover expected loss, with a 
reasonable load to cover the cost of administering the plan, and whether or not 
insurers are taking unreasonable financial risks with their investments. Ex ante (or 
before bankruptcy occurs), government oversight involves seeing that premiums 
are adequate to cover anticipated losses and expenses and that the asset mix of 
reserves is not too risky. 
 Another task of regulators is to restructure insurers for which insolvency 
seems imminent. Ex post mitigation of loss includes government requirements that 
insurers contribute to a risk pool or guaranty fund, which compensates policyhold-
ers who otherwise would not receive payment for losses they incur as a result of 
insurer bankruptcy. 
 An important objective of premium regulation is to prevent insurers from 
exercising market power in setting premiums. In contrast to solvency regulation, 
which guards against premiums being set too low, under premium regulation, 
governments monitor whether premiums are too high in order to ensure the public 
access to insurance at quasi-competitive rates. Excessive prices in the market may 
result from lack of consumer knowledge and high consumer search costs, which 
limit competition. In addition, competition may theoretically be diminished 
because it is difficult for insurers to determine consumers ’ risk level, creating an 
informational advantage for existing insurers and creating a barrier to entry. 
 When insurance premium spikes occur, governments are pressured to act in 
various ways to reduce premiums or limit further rises in premiums. On the other 
hand, insurers facing competitive threats or attempting to increase their market 
share may actually set premiums too low relative to expected losses. There is an 
analogy to the fairy tale Goldilocks and the Three Bears:  “ This porridge is too hot. 
This porridge is too cold. This porridge is just right. ” In the long run, it seems 
likely that the porridge, or the insurance premiums, may be just right. However, 
in the shorter run, the porridge may be either too hot or too cold — excessive prices 
when too hot and inadequate prices when too cold. 
 Another goal of insurance regulation is to ensure that insurance is readily 
available to potential purchasers. Some types of insurance are seen as essential for 
individuals to have. Health insurance falls in this category. 
 Without government intervention, insurers may find it desirable to exclude 
some potential policyholders. Such exclusions may take various forms ( Swartz 
2006 , 75 – 77). Insurers may outright refuse to issue a health insurance policy to 
some individuals. They may specialize in marketing to certain types of individuals 
who tend to be good health risks, such as persons who have left the armed services, 
persons engaged in a learned profession, or self-employed individuals. They may 
deny coverage to persons with specific preexisting health conditions. They may 
seek to attract relatively healthy individuals by subsidizing memberships in health 
clubs. 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 439
 However, it may be in the public interest that such risks be covered. Such 
concerns have arisen in the context of automobile insurance as well as health 
insurance. Being able to drive may be essential to maintaining employment, and 
the availability of liability insurance is directly linked to being able to drive in 
states with compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance laws. 
 The astute reader will think,  “ Wait a minute! Earlier in this book, you 
complained about adverse selection, and now you are criticizing insurers for 
trying to do something about this. ” The astute reader has a point. Insurers attempt 
to weed out persons who are likely to be heavy users of health services from their 
insurance pools. This is a way of combating adverse selection. But at the same 
time, societies apparently view health insurance as a right; you do not get to pick 
your parents or your genes, and further, it is unseemly when people who face 
adverse circumstances, such as being in bad health, are denied insurance 
coverage. 
 A final rationale for insurance regulation is information provision and fair 
play. Information provision and government review of policy forms (a government 
reviews insurance contracts to be sure the language is understandable, clear, and 
accurate and conveys the key features of the contracts) are more important when 
the customer is not highly educated or is an infrequent purchaser of coverage. The 
motive of fair play sometimes leads to requirements that insurers sell insurance to 
high-risk customers at premiums below the actuarial value of the loss. This has 
occurred in motor vehicle liability insurance most prominently, which has been 
combined with withdrawal restrictions forcing insurers to remain in an unprofit-
able market for longer than they would voluntarily choose. 
 Insurance Mandates: A Form of Private Regulation of Private 
Health Insurance 
 Insurance mandates take two distinct forms. The most common is a legal require-
ment that insurers that market policies offer a specific benefit, such as maternity 
stays, mental health services, and chiropractic care. One rationale for such require-
ments is that people may be insufficiently well informed about the benefits to be 
derived from such services because they have not used such services previously. 
Or they tend to underestimate the probability that they will need such services in 
the future ( Summers 1989 ). However, when the need arises, they will presumably 
be pleased that the services are covered. An unstated rationale for such mandates —
 and a very real reason that mandates exist — is that a professional group whose 
members supply the services benefits from insurance mandates in the form of 
increased demand and hence compensation. 
 The other form of mandate is a requirement that an employer provide health 
insurance to employees who satisfy some criteria specified by the law or a set of 
regulations formulated on the basis of the law, such as working more than a specific 
number of hours per week. 

440 
 Part II / Chapter 10
 Advocates of insurance mandates make several arguments in support of these 
laws and regulations. First, on equity grounds, it is argued that every person should 
have access to health insurance as a right. Second, the lack of health insurance 
leads to payment shortfalls, which, if sufficiently large, could lead to bankruptcies 
of suppliers of personal health care services. Uninsured persons are treated in 
hospital emergency rooms, often at little or no out-of-pocket cost to the uninsured 
person. As a consequence, the prices of emergency room services paid by insured 
persons rise. This burden is ultimately paid by those persons who have insurance — 
a cost-shifting argument. If this is so, then why doesn ’ t government provide health 
insurance in the first place? 
 Third, mandating private health insurance coverage as opposed to public 
provision of health insurance avoids the deadweight loss that would result from 
an increase in taxes to finance the public provision of health insurance. By  dead-
weight loss , economists mean a loss attributable to a change in allocation of scarce 
resources from the allocation that would have occurred in the absence of some 
distortion. For example, moral hazard involves a deadweight loss (see chapter 3). 
In the context of health insurance mandates, the deadweight loss may take the 
form, for example, of reduced incentives to work when marginal personal income 
tax rates are raised. 
 Suppose that the government required employers to provide a health insur-
ance policy valued at $1,000. This mandate would shift each employer ’ s demand 
curve for labor downward by $1,000 (  fig. 10.3 ), that is, from  D 0 to  D 1. However, at 
least some of the employees value the benefit. Thus, the aggregate supply curve of 
labor shifts downward from  S 0 to  S 1 , but the downward shift in labor supply is not 
as great as the downward shift in employer demand. The supply curve of labor of 
those persons who do not value getting health insurance through the job does not 
change. Thus, the wage-employment equilibrium changes from ( w 0 ,  E 0 ) to ( w 1 ,  E 1 ) 
following implementation of the mandate. Both wage rates and employment fall 
as a result of a requirement that employers offer health insurance to all of their 
employees. If, however, the supply curve shifts downward by as much as the 
downward shift in demand, implying that the employees ’ valuation of the mandate 
equals the cost of the mandate, then the mandate causes a decrease in wage rates 
but no change in employment (f  ig. 10.4 ).  
 Mandated benefits represent a tax equal to the difference between the employ-
ers ’ cost of providing the benefit and the employees ’ valuation of the benefit, not 
the cost of providing the benefit ( Summers 1989 , 181). From a societal vantage 
point, there is a question about how employees ’ valuations should be measured. 
To the extent that employees  “ undervalue ”  a service with which they have had no 
prior experience or underestimate the probability of using the service, it is not at 
all clear that ex ante valuations are meaningful and useful for making welfare 
comparisons. 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 441
 If, rather than mandating particular benefits, the government decided to 
provide coverage to all as a public benefit, the resulting welfare losses could be 
larger than with the mandate. Employers and employees who otherwise would 
have been unaffected by a mandate (nonemployed persons) would be subject to 
increased taxes. 
 Conceptually, the distortion could be minimized by imposing a head tax on 
everyone. A head tax is a tax of a fixed dollar amount per person. If one pays a 
specific sum just for breathing, distortions in economic activity are limited. On the 
other hand, head taxes raise questions of vertical equity (meaning that the rich 
should pay higher taxes than the poor) since the poor pay the same tax as the rich. 
By contrast, payroll or personal income taxes may be fairer, but they introduce 
distortions, such as in the worker ’ s work-leisure decision. 
 Mandated benefits have deficiencies if one views the lack of coverage as 
reflecting individuals ’ underestimating the probability of event occurring. Persons 
who are not employed are unaffected by an employer benefit mandate. Thus, if the 
objective is that obstetric care be covered, with mandated employer-based insur-
ance benefits, nonemployed women would not have such coverage. Another class 
of problems results from wage rigidities. For persons who earn the legal minimum

wage, mandated health insurance cannot result in a lower wage rate. Rather, the 
full effect of the mandate is on reduced employment. 
 The law generally requires that if an employer provides health insurance to 
its employees, the health insurance benefit must be the same for all employees. 
But the cost of providing the benefit plausibly differs markedly among employees. 
Older employees use much more health care on average than do younger employ-
ees. At younger ages, however, female employees are likely to use maternity ben-
efits. If wages can perfectly adjust — for example, if older workers ’ wages fall 
relative to those for younger workers — the market will adjust for the mandate 
without important changes in the relative employment of older versus younger 
workers occurring. However, if wage rigidities prevent such adjustments from 
occurring, that is, if cuts in absolute wages are difficult to implement, then employ-
ers affected by the mandate will seek to hire disproportionate numbers of younger 
workers or part-time workers, who may be exempt from the mandate. This type of 
distortion would not occur under public provision of the services. 
 One reason why mandated benefits are so politically popular is that the cost 
of such benefits does not appear in public budgets. Thus, politicians can claim 
they have delivered new benefits to their constituents without actually having to 
raise taxes. Superficially, mandated benefits appear to be  “ free, ” but in reality they

are not free. Even though the electorate is likely to pay for mandated benefits in 
terms of real wage reductions, perhaps not realized precisely at the time the 
mandate is implemented but gradually over time, the electorate may be insuffi-
ciently informed to recognize this. 
 Empirical studies have been conducted on the effects of mandated insurance 
benefits on wages and employment. There is a risk of overgeneralizing because 
there is likely to be variation in employee valuation of mandated benefits. Probably 
the best-known empirical study is by  Gruber (1994) , who studied the impact 
of mandated maturity benefits. The rationale for requiring that maternity benefits 
be an included insurance benefit relates to equal treatment of pregnant women 
and other employees. Before mandates were enacted by state governments in the 
United States and by the US government, health insurance benefits generally 
limited maternity benefits in two ways. Either there was no coverage for costs 
incurred during pregnancy or benefits were paid as a lump-sum benefit, indepen-
dent of the cost the family actually incurred for prenatal care and obstetric 
deliveries. 
 The Gruber study used a time series of US state cross sections, which took 
advantage of (1) the fact that the mandate applied to some employees within a state 
that had a mandate, (2) variation among states in having or not having mandates, 
and (3) changes in state laws requiring maternity benefits over time. Gruber found 
that employees who were likely to benefit, primarily young adult women or spouses 
with family coverage in the age group in which pregnancies are most likely to 
occur, bore the cost of the mandate in terms of reduced wages. For this reason, 
there was very little change in employment. 
 Mandates can have important effects other than on wage compensation and 
employment levels.  Schmidt (2007)  studied whether mandates to include the cost 
of infertility treatments in the health insurance package affected fertility rates. She 
found that mandates significantly increased first birth rates among women over 
age 35. 
 Klick and Markowitz (2006)  studied the impact of mandated mental health 
benefits on suicide rates. Suicides are often caused by mental illness. The authors 
found no effect of mandates on suicide rates. The effects of mandates seem to vary 
according to the benefits being mandated and also the details of implementation, 
such as the quantity of services covered required as part of a benefit package. 
 Community Rating 
 Views on the goals of health insurance differ both within and among countries. 
According to one view, demand for health insurance stems from a household ’ s 
desire for health expenditure risk protection. The aggregate demand for health 
insurance then is the sum of individual households ’ demand for coverage. It 
follows that premiums should reflect the loss anticipated for the household unit 
during the policy year. As the health of family members and hence anticipated 

444 
 Part II / Chapter 10
expenditures change, premiums should be adjusted accordingly. The sick should 
pay more for health insurance than the well do. 
 A contrasting view is that we are all in this boat together. Some people are 
more fortunate to be endowed with good health; others are less fortunate in this 
regard. While the healthy are lucky, they are unlucky in being obligated to subsi-
dize their fellow citizens who are less healthy than they are. The theory that we 
are all in the boat together and hence all are obligated to bear part of the burden 
is called the  solidarity principle  ( Zweifel and Breyer 1997 ). 
 With group employer-based insurance, the healthy implicitly subsidize the 
sick members of the group. Holding other factors constant, unhealthy or older 
employees are more costly to employers. To the extent that older workers are pre-
dominantly employed in certain job categories, it is feasible for employers to adjust 
wages downward to compensate for the higher anticipated health insurance outlays. 
In fact, there is empirical evidence that this does occur (see  Pauly 1997 , 90). 
 Even when employers do not self-insure, the insurance that they purchase is 
likely to be highly experience rated. That is, the premiums for year  t + 1 reflect 
losses actually incurred by the group in year  t . Self-insured groups are experience 
rated in that the self-insured entity bears the entire cost of the group (less the 
component that is borne by citizens at large, given the tax exclusion of health 
insurance benefits provided by employers). 
 In individual insurance markets, at least conceptually, matters might be dif-
ferent. Theoretically, if insurers had as much information as insured individuals 
do, there would be no cross subsidies. Every premium would be actuarially fair, 
that is, premiums would be set equal to expected loss, plus a competitively deter-
mined loading factor. 
 Recent empirical evidence for the United States implies that there are small 
differences in premiums among the healthy and sick in individual insurance 
markets, which implies that a considerable amount of risk pooling occurs. This 
may occur because insurers do not update premiums dollar for dollar for every 
dollar change in an individual insured ’ s health expenditure ( Marquis and Buntin 
2006 ). On the other hand, there  are some health-related differences in premiums, 
and many unhealthy individuals lack health insurance coverage of any type in the 
United States. 
 To protect persons in poor health within their jurisdictions, some US states 
have adopted the requirement that individual insurance premiums be community 
rated. Community rating means that premiums can reflect the experience of the 
community as a whole, with some differentials in premiums according to such 
factors as age and gender, but an individual ’ s health expenditure history is not to 
be used as a factor in premium setting. 
 To the extent that premium differences based on health are reduced by com-
munity rating, one would expect an increase in demand for community-rated 
insurance relative to demand without such laws, and this shift has been observed 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 445
(see, e.g.,  Buchanan and Marquis 1999 ), with higher percentages of unhealthy 
persons being insured and the healthy being uninsured. However, the empirical 
evidence indicates that any effect of community rating on the share of persons 
without health insurance is at most small ( Sloan and Conover 1998 ). 
 Managed Care Defined 
 Given the combination of high fees and little cost sharing at the point of delivery 
of services, along with the rising expenditures on personal health services that 
ensued, by the 1980s the stage was set for major changes in health insurance con-
tracts. Although managed care as a concept was decades old, meaningful growth 
of managed care enrollments in the United States first occurred during the 1980s. 
Managed care plans have grown very rapidly and have become the dominant form 
of health insurance contract in the United States ( Glied 2000 ). 
 Although there is no standard definition of managed care, three elements are 
important to any definition with the elements varying in importance by type of 
managed care plan (table 10.3). The first element is some management of utilization 
by the health plan. This may take the form of prior authorization by the insurer 
before a patient can be admitted to a hospital or undergo a major procedure, such 
as a surgical operation. In some health plans, restriction on choice of provider is 
accomplished through the use of gatekeeper physicians who must approve all 
referrals to specialists. Some managed care plans have used this gatekeeper arrange-
ment to restrict the use of specialty services by holding primary care physicians

(general or family physicians, general internists, pediatricians) financially respon-
sible for referrals.  Financial responsibility  means that the physician has a financial 
disincentive to refer his or her patients to other physicians or to admit them to 
hospitals. Another form of utilization control is ex post utilization review. The 
service is provided but payment for the service may be subsequently denied if the 
insurer determines that the service was not clinically justified or simply not 
covered. 
 Second, managed care plans impose limits on the physicians, hospitals, and 
pharmaceutical products covered by the plan. For example, a physician who is a 
high utilizer of diagnostic tests and has a low threshold for admitting patients to 
the hospital may be excluded from a health plan. To be covered by the plan, the 
patient must go to providers on the insurer ’ s list. If the patient sees a physician 
not on the list, coverage for the services provided by the physicians is denied. 
 Under a provider selection process called  selective contracting , managed care 
plans can decide to include some providers in their networks and exclude others. 
In contrast, under the traditional health insurance system, insurers are required to 
deal with all licensed providers. To do otherwise would be considered to interfere 
with the practice of medicine. 
 By requiring or encouraging patients to use selected providers, managed care 
plans gain bargaining power to obtain a lower price from providers with whom 
they contract. By increasing patient flow, the selected providers in turn have the 
potential of increasing quality of care through a volume-outcome effect ( “ Practice 
(through higher volume) may make perfect ” ). Selective contracting with providers 
and provider networks is potentially a valuable tool for managed care plans to 
reduce cost and improve quality. Since about 2000, managed care plans in the 
United States have relaxed their policies of steering their plan enrollees to particu-
lar health care providers ( Fang and Rizzo 2009 ,  2010 ). This may be a market 
response to the  “ managed care backlash ” described below. 
 The third element is financial incentives. There are financial incentives for 
providers and patients. A major financial incentive for providers to limit utilization 
is provided by capitation payment. Under capitation, the provider receives a fixed 
payment per patient per time period, such as a month. The cost of any services 
provided is borne by the provider. Thus, in contrast to the fee-for-service system 
that prevails under traditional health insurance, in which providing more services 
is likely to mean higher profit, under capitation, the provision of more services 
reduces profit (see, e.g.,  Cutler, McClellan, and Newhouse 2000 ;  Glied 2000 ;  Baker 
and Phibbs 2002 ). Because providers, particularly physicians, bear the cost of extra 
services at the margin, capitation payment amounts to supply-side cost sharing; 
physicians share in the full financial risk of illness ( Ellis and McGuire 1993 ). 
 Managed care plans have a strong incentive to search for low-priced provid-
ers. Under traditional health insurance, individual patients have little incentive to 
search for low-cost providers because they at most bear a small portion of the full 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 447
cost of care. Rather, the insurer bears the expenditure risk (and presumably is well 
positioned to do this, given the pooling of uncorrelated expenditure risks of indi-
viduals). In addition, the search cost is likely to be higher for individual patients 
than for health plans. For individuals, the receipt of health care is typically a rela-
tively rare event. For insurers, health care utilization is an everyday occurrence. 
Insurers ’  search costs are lower because they can take advantage of economies of 
scale in developing large information systems for searching. The benefits of search-
ing for low-cost providers are higher in managed care plans because coverage tends 
to be complete. (There is relatively little patient cost sharing.) Thus, if the plan 
saves $1,000, for example, by identifying and recruiting a low-cost physician to 
the plan, much if not practically all of the saving will accrue to the health plan. 
Managed care plans can use the network as a tool to influence the patient flow to 
the selected provider. The inclusion or exclusion of providers in the network can 
alter market demand faced by the individual physicians, which in turn gives such 
plans an important instrument to influence physician behavior in terms of their 
choice of quantity and quality of health care services ( McGuire 2000 ). 
 Managed care plans sometimes employ demand-side cost sharing to influence 
patient flows. As with traditional health insurance, demand-side cost sharing, 
in the form of co-payments or deductibles, is applied to control the use of health 
care services. In addition, managed care plans use demand-side cost sharing to 
encourage persons they insure to use services provided by providers within the 
plan ’ s own network ( Glied 2000 ), although to a lesser extent than traditional health 
insurers in the United States do. For example, some managed care plans employ 
differential cost sharing, which requires insured persons to pay a higher co-pay-
ment for using out-of-network services and imposes no or a lower co-payment for 
using services within the network. Multi-tiered pricing is also used to encourage 
the insured to use drugs on the plan ’ s formulary and to use generic rather than 
branded drugs. 
 There are three types of managed care plans in the United States (table 10.3). 
First, some managed care plans fully integrate insurance, financing, and care provi-
sion functions. These are group and staff model health maintenance organization 
(HMOs). An HMO plan covers services on a capitated basis, which means that the 
provider or organization receives a fixed payment per enrollee for the provision of 
services over a fixed time period, such as a year. When the organization rather than 
the individual physician is paid the capitated payment, the most common approach, 
physicians may be employed on a salaried basis, which is in sharp contrast to 
traditional health insurance, in which insurance and service delivery are fully 
separated and the role of the insurer is limited to paying bills, while payment to 
providers is made on a fee-for-service basis (table 10.3). 
 A survey of primary care urban California physicians ’ experiences with finan-
cial incentives in managed care plans conducted in 1996 documented the wide-
spread use of explicit incentives (40 percent reported being subject to such 

448 
 Part II / Chapter 10
incentives) for physicians to limit care, such as financial rewards for limiting hos-
pital admissions of their patients as well as limiting referrals to specialists ( Grum-
bach, Osmond, Vranizan, et al. 1998 ). Such incentives may be employed in addition 
to or instead of compensation of a salaried basis. An empirical evaluation of the 
effects of physician incentives in HMOs concluded that medical expenditures of 
HMOs were 5 percent lower than they would have been in the absence of such 
incentives ( Gaynor, Rebitzer, and Taylor 2004 ).  
 Other two types of managed care organizations are in between the traditional 
insurance model and the group/staff model. In one, through contractual arrange-
ments, insured individuals ’ choice of providers is limited to a defined set of inde-
pendent providers, independent practice associations (IPAs). In the other, preferred 
provider organizations (PPOs), insured individuals pay discounted fees if they 
receive care from providers in the PPOs ’ networks, but insured individuals receive 
some insurance benefits even if they see providers outside such networks. In 
essence, under this arrangement, a patient ’ s choice of providers is unrestricted, but 
the plans provide incentives to use selected providers and monitor the care pro-
vided. A point-of-service (POS) plan is a program in which enrollees may receive 
care within the PPO network or go outside the network and receive indemnity 
insurance, which is a fixed dollar subsidy per unit of service, with the insured 
person paying the full difference between the physician ’ s fee and the fixed dollar 
subsidy (see, e.g.,  Fang and Rizzo 2010 ). 
 The Effect of Managed Care on Market Structure and 
Providers ’ and Patients ’ Incentives 
 An important feature of managed care is selective contracting and network forma-
tion. Limiting coverage to a defined set of providers offers two advantages to 
managed care networks and to society more generally to the extent that competition 
among providers is welfare increasing. The first advantage is that selective contract-
ing allows managed care organizations to exclude providers it judges to be ineffi-
cient or of low quality. Second, by limiting the number of providers in its network, 
the organization gains bargaining power in its negotiations with providers. The 
advantage to providers of being in the network is that they receive a guaranteed 
set of customers. On the other hand, for giving providers this additional business, 
the managed care organization typically demands and obtains discounted prices 
on covered services. 
 This process by which physicians who charge higher fees may be excluded 
from the network substantially increases the price elasticity of demand facing the 
individual provider or provider group. If the physicians charge slightly more than 
the managed care network demands, they may lose access to many potential 
patients, specifically those patients enrolled in the managed care plan in question. 
The selective contracting process thus introduces price competition into medical 
markets where this is lacking under traditional health insurance plans. 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 449
 Negotiated discounted rates with a defined panel of providers may reduce 
the profitability of services and hence reduce rates of entry of new firms, although 
the providers may be compensated by increasing the flow of patients. Furthermore, 
managed care plans may encourage their enrollees to consume a different bundle 
of services than that consumed by patients with traditional health insurance, such 
as a shift from hospital inpatient to outpatient services or from curative care to 
preventive care ( Baker and Brown 1999 ). 
 Using mammography provision as an example,  Baker and Brown (1999)  
found that the growth of managed care led to consolidation of providers in this 
health care market. More specifically, they found that an increased managed care 
market share is associated with decreased numbers of mammography facilities and 
with increases in volume per facility for those facilities that remained in the 
market. 
 Selective contacting also alters consumer incentives. Under traditional health 
insurance, patients are free to choose their providers. But patients have little incen-
tive to select low-cost providers because patients bear only a small portion of the 
full cost of care and may lack knowledge about which providers are low cost. 
Advertising bans limit dissemination of price information. Thus, to learn about 
prices, it is necessary to actually visit particular providers. As a consequence, 
competition among providers is mainly on a non-price basis. For example, hospi-
tals tend to invest in new technologies and equipment to attract patients and their 
primary care physicians, described as a  “ medical arm race ” in literature (see 
 Dranove and Satterthwaite 2000;  chapter 6, this book). More intense competition 
among hospitals historically has been associated with higher, not lower, cost 
( Dranove, Shanley, and White 1993 ). 
 By contrast, managed care plans are relatively well positioned to search for 
low-cost providers, and with selective contracting, they can limit plan enrollees ’ 
use of services to those providers they select. The focus of market competition 
consequently shifts from non-price aspects to price.  Dranove, Shanley, and White 
(1993)  described this as  “ payer-driven competition, ” in contrast to  “ patient-driven 
competition ”  under traditional health insurance. 
 Selective contracting can effectively operate only when there is a choice 
among providers. Thus, selective contracting is more likely to succeed in markets 
where there are many providers and their operation is not at full capacity.  Dranove, 
Simon, and White (1998)  found that managed care plans are more likely to 
use selective contracting in markets with more hospitals with lower occupancy 
rates. 
 Under patient-driven competition, there is a negative relationship between 
price, such as the prices of hospital services, and market concentration. Under 
payer-driven competition, the relation between price and market concentration 
becomes positive because the managed care plans are more likely to obtain a lower 
price as the market becomes less concentrated ( Dranove and Satterthwaite 2000 ). 

450 
 Part II / Chapter 10
 Using data from the 1980s from the US state of California,  Dranove, Shanley, 
and White (1993) tested the price-concentration relationship, finding that prices of 
hospital services and market concentration (as measured by the Herfindahl-
Hirschman Index) were significantly negatively related in 1983. By contrast, the 
price-concentration relationship became significantly positive in 1988. Taken 
together, these results suggest that a switch from patient-driven to payer-driven 
competition occurred in California following the change in the law in 1982 that 
permitted payers to use selective contracting. 
 Many managed care plans use capitation as their major payment to physi-
cians.  McGuire (2000 ,  2008 ) developed a conceptual framework for analyzing the 
effect of capitation on physician incentives. Physician revenue is 
 R +  p s x ,  
(10.1) 
 where  R is a fixed amount representing capitation payments that is made indepen-
dent of the services provided,  x is the quantity of physician services, and  p s is the 
payment per unit of service. Thus,  p s x represents variable revenue, which depends 
on the quantity of services the physician provides. The revenue function incorpo-
rates the element of supply-side cost sharing if  p s is less than marginal cost per 
unit of service. If the physician only has patients covered by a pure capitation 
contract,  p s equals zero. Payers can design incentives to elicit desired behavior 
from a provider by choosing the appropriate combination of fixed revenue ( R ) and 
fee for variable revenue portion ( p s ). 
 Quality is essentially noncontractible in that it is difficult to use as a basis 
for payment. Noncontractible inputs include physician time, attentiveness, and 
diligence. Each potentially affects the outcomes of care, but these inputs cannot be 
directly monitored or set by the payer. The benefit the patient receives thus depends 
not only on the quantity of services but also on these hard to monitor qualitative 
aspects of care. The marginal benefit of quality is positive but declines, at least 
past some quality threshold. The provision of quality is costly to physicians, 
although not used as a basis for payment. The marginal cost of services is positively 
related to the quality level. 
 Patients value quality. Thus, although providing higher quality entails a cost 
to the physician, higher quality increases patient demand. In this way, physicians 
are rewarded for providing a higher quality of care by being able to attract more 
patients. 
 The physician chooses both quantity and quality (as measured by effort) of 
health care services to maximize profit. The distinction of quantity and quality in 
this model is that quantity is contractible but quality is not. 
 The optimal solution for the choice of quantity satisfies the condition that 
the marginal benefit received by the physician equals the marginal cost borne by 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 451
the physician. At least in principle, it is possible to design a payment scheme, that 
is, a combination of  R and  p s , to elicit socially optimal levels of quantity and quality 
from physicians. 
 Managed Care and Health System Performance 
 Overview 
 Although managed care offers several attractive features in theory, in the end, what 
matters is how it works in practice. Performance has been measured by indicators 
of spending, price, quantity (utilization per capita), quality, and technology adop-
tion. We first describe some individual studies and then report results from litera-
ture reviews that have been conducted on this subject. 
 Effects of Managed Care on Spending on Personal Health Care 
 Cutler and Sheiner (1998)  used variation in managed care penetration across states 
between 1988 and 1993 in the United States as a laboratory for examining the 
impact of managed care, measured by population share of HMO enrollments, on 
the growth of aggregate expenditures on health care services. They concluded that 
increased managed care plan penetration decreases growth in such spending. States 
with higher managed care penetration experienced substantially lower expenditure 
growth during this period. The systemwide savings from managed care mainly 
came from a reduction in expenditures for hospital care, which in turn primarily 
came from reductions in patient length of hospital stay. A 10 percent increase 
in the managed care share decreased the growth of hospital spending by about 
0.5 percent and total health care spending by about 0.4 percent, which implies 
that increased spending on physicians offset some of the savings in hospital 
spending. 
 Conceptually, managed care plans can reduce the growth of health care 
spending through four mechanisms. First, managed care organizations might reduce 
price through negotiating price reductions or searching for low-cost providers, 
using selective contracting as a negotiating tool. Second, such organizations might 
reduce the quantity of health services provided to patients through various forms 
of utilization review. Third, they might save money through offering lower quality 
at lower cost. Fourth, they might reduce the growth of health care spending by 
reducing the rate of technology adoption, because technology change in medicine 
has long been identified as a major driver of increasing spending in health care 
( Newhouse 1992 ). Given these four channels, how in fact do managed care orga-
nizations achieve their savings? 
 Cutler, McClellan, and Newhouse (2000)  addressed this question by compar-
ing prices paid and treatments received for a common set of conditions in different 
insurance plans. Their data came from two different sources: claims records from 
a large US firm offering both managed care policies and a traditional health 

452 
 Part II / Chapter 10
insurance policy, and state data containing inpatient claims for all persons people 
admitted to hospitals in the US state of Massachusetts. Focusing on care for patients 
with heart disease, Cutler and coauthors measured the difference in spending on 
services between persons enrolled in managed care and those with traditional 
insurance plans; they decomposed the difference in spending into a pure price 
component and a quantity/quality component. 
 They found a statistically significant difference in the mean level of payment 
for heart attacks between managed care plans and traditional insurance plans. For 
example, average reimbursement by HMOs was only 61 percent that of the tradi-
tional insurance policies. Procedure use was about the same between the two types 
of health insurance plans. However, the amount paid by managed care plans for a 
common bundle of services was only 57 percent of the amount paid by traditional 
health plans, after accounting for differences in patient characteristics. Health 
outcomes did not depend on the type of insurance plan selected. Cutler and col-
leagues concluded that virtually all the difference in health care spending between 
managed care and traditional insurance plans came from lower unit prices rather 
than from a reduction in the quantity or quality of services received.  4 With regard 
to the impact of managed care on quality of care, the existing literature indicates 
there is little difference in the quality of care provided under managed care plans 
and traditional insurance plan ( Glied 2000 ;  Baker and McClellan 2001 ). The empir-
ical evidence is inconsistent with the argument that managed care plans might save 
money by offering lower quality at lower cost. Rather, managed care provides care 
of comparable quality but at a lower cost. 
 However, simple comparisons of cost between the two types of plan ignore 
that managed care may affect the utilization of health care services persons enrolled 
in traditional insurance plans. These spillovers may occur through at least two 
mechanisms. First, where there are high levels of managed care penetration, the 
demand for certain types of services, such as hospital inpatient care, is likely to 
be low. This may lead to reductions in the capacity of such services, such as the 
number of hospital beds. Lower capacity in turn may make it more difficult for 
persons enrolled in traditional health insurance plans to be treated in these 
facilities. Managed care may reduce health cost growth by reducing rates of tech-
nology diffusion, which is recognized as a major source of health care expenditure 
growth. 
 Second, there will be spillovers in how patients are treated for specific condi-
tions. It is difficult for physicians to maintain different approaches to care based 
on the treatment philosophies and policies of individual insurers. Thus, once 
managed care becomes an important force in a community, physicians may decide 
to adopt the managed care style of practice for all of their patients. There is empiri-
cal support that this type of spillover effect occurs ( Baker and McClellan 2001 ; 
 Chandra and Staiger 2007 ). The growth of managed care results in the systemwide 
provision of high-quality care at lower cost. 
4.  The  gross  price of 
personal health care 
services (price charged 
by the provider) has its 
own impact on medical 
care demand. An 
increased price leads to 
a reduction in the 
quantity of services 
demanded (see chapter 
3). But it can also affect 
the choice of insurer 
( Dusansky and Koc 
2006 ), and the nature of 
the insurance contract 
can also affect demand. 
To the extent that 
managed care plans are 
relatively effective 
negotiators with 
providers, one would 
expect the relative 
demand for such health 
plans to increase during 
peri ods of medical price 
inflation.

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 453
 Although we have emphasized results from individual studies, the thrust of 
the literature is consistent with the findings from the studies just described. After 
reviewing many individual studies,  Glied (2000)  concluded that total health care 
spending in managed care plans tends to be about 10 – 15 percent lower than in 
other insurance plans, based on a review of seventy-nine studies published between 
1997 and mid-2001. Differences in expenditures do not reflect lower rates of visits 
to physicians among persons enrolled in managed care plans. If anything, such 
utilization tends to be higher in such plans ( Deb, Li, Trivedi, et al. 2006 ). 
 Not all empirical studies agree that managed care results in reduced expen-
ditures on personal health services or in the composition of reductions, to the 
extent that they exist. For example,  Shin and Moon (2007)  concluded that HMO 
plans reduce members ’ out-of-pocket spending relative to that of members of other 
health insurance plans. But they found no difference between HMOs and other 
plans in what the plans themselves spent. A comparison of utilization between 
fee-for-service and managed care among pregnant women and during labor and 
delivery yielded mixed findings, including higher rates of use of ultrasound use 
during pregnancy in managed care plans but lower rates of cesarean sections among 
women enrolled in such plans ( Turcotte, Robst, and Polachek 2006 ). 
 Effects of Managed Care on Diffusion of Technology 
 Managed care affects the diffusion of new and expensive technologies in several 
ways. First, to the extent that managed care plans pay less per unit of service for 
intensive treatments that depend on use of new medical technology and equip-
ment, the expected profitability from adopting a new technology declines, which 
in turn reduces the incentive for technology adoption. 
 Second, when prices paid providers fall, the price-cost margin of hospitals 
and other services is reduced, which in turn affects the overall financial position 
of providers of health care services. As a result, the availability of relatively low-
cost internal funds to finance the adoption of new technology decreases, potentially 
forcing adopters of new technologies to use higher-cost external funds to finance 
the capital projects. This raises the expected cost of adopting new technology and 
hence decreases such investment (see chapter 9). 
 Third, the growth of managed care has shifted the nature of competition from 
patient-driven to payer-driven competition. Under patient-driven competition, 
hospitals tend to compete on a non-price basis, such as through offering new tech-
nology. The cost of adopting new technology is then financed by increased revenue, 
either charge-based (fee-for-service) or cost-based reimbursement (see chapter 6). 
By contrast, under payer-driven competition, hospitals compete by offering lower 
prices to managed care plans. Early adoption of new technologies has consequently 
become less relevant for attracting patients to individual hospitals. 
 All three factors work to decrease technology diffusion in areas in which 
managed care plans enroll a large share of the population. Several empirical studies 

454 
 Part II / Chapter 10
provide support for this proposition. Using state data,  Cutler and Sheiner (1998)  
found that increased HMO enrollment was associated with less rapid diffusion of 
a range of new technologies in hospitals, and this effect increased over time. In 
addition, they found that the growth of managed care changed the composition of 
technology leaders in health care markets: states with high managed care activity 
that were formerly technology leaders became only average in new technology 
acquisition.  Baker (2001) reported that increases in HMO market share are associ-
ated with slower diffusion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as declines 
in the use of MRI procedures.  Baker and Phibbs (2002)  reported that increases in 
managed care activity are associated with slower adoption of neonatal intensive 
care units. 
 More recently,  Mas and Seinfeld (2008 ) examined the effects of managed care 
in general and HMO penetration in particular on the diffusion of thirteen technolo-
gies in the United States. These technologies included those used in diagnostic 
radiology (diagnostic radioisotope studies, ultrasonography, computed tomogra-
phy, MRI, positron emission tomography), radiation therapy (X-ray therapy, thera-
peutic radioisotope treatment, radioactive implants, megavoltage irradiation, 
stereotactic radiosurgery), and cardiac technology (cardiac catheterization, open 
heart surgery, and angioplasty). Although the magnitude of effect of HMO enroll-
ment on the presence of the technologies differed by technology, the effects were 
uniformly negative and statistically significant at conventional levels. 
 Although a less rapid diffusion of new technologies contributes to reduced 
long-term growth of health care expenditures, less rapid diffusion could have the 
unfortunate adverse side effect of reducing the rate of improvement in health out-
comes. Thus, the welfare effect of slower technology diffusion cannot be deduced 
without further considering its impact on health outcomes. 
 Baker and Phibbs (2002)  examined this issue by decomposing neonatal inten-
sive care units (NICUs) into two types, high- and midlevel, and found that slower 
diffusion of NICUs attributable to the growth of managed care primarily reflected 
a slower adoption in less sophisticated midlevel units. Increases in the availability 
of midlevel NICUs were associated with increases in mortality for very low-birth-
weight infants, but this relationship was reversed for high-level NICUs. This pattern 
of results suggests that the slower diffusion of technology may not necessarily 
produce a classical welfare trade-off between cost and outcomes. If reductions in 
the rate of technology diffusion are mainly attributable to changes in the adoption 
of technologies with low marginal benefits, these reductions may not adversely 
affect outcomes in a major way. 
 Miller and Luft (2002)  concluded that HMOs and traditional health insurance 
plans offer comparable quality of care, but that HMOs have a somewhat lower use 
of hospitals and other expensive services. However, they cautioned that HMO 
enrollees reported worse results on several indicators of access to care and had 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 455
lower levels of satisfaction with care received than did persons with traditional 
health insurance. Further, there was variability in quality within the HMO sector. 
 Xu and Jensen (2007) , studying the impact of HMO membership on functional 
status (ability to perform tasks of daily living) of the near elderly (persons near but 
below age 65), found that HMO members fared worse in that they experienced 
greater declines in functional status if they had chronic conditions. For the near 
elderly overall, however, there were no differences in functional status decline 
between persons enrolled in traditional fee-for-service insurance plans and those 
enrolled in HMOs. 
 Data from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment show a similar pattern as 
the Xu-Jensen study. In particular, per capita spending in a staff model HMO was 
40 percent lower than in a fee-for-service plan in the same city. While the health 
effects of plan membership were generally similar between HMO and fee-for-ser-
vice plans, low-income enrollees who began the experiment with health problems 
fared worse in the HMO than in the fee-for-service plan ( Ware, Brook, Rogers, et 
al. 1986 ). 
 The averages thus obscure some difference in quality among individual plans. 
 Gottfried and Sloan (2002 ) reviewed the evidence on the quality of care provided 
by HMOs versus that provided by non-HMOs in the treatment of specific condi-
tions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, geriatric problems, pregnancy, and 
pediatric disease. Like Miller and Luft, they described findings indicating that 
enrollees in HMO plans expressed dissatisfaction with some aspect of their experi-
ences, but overall, on most indicators, the quality of care financed by HMOs was 
comparable to that the quality of care financed by non-HMOs. 
 Rizzo (2005)  studied the impact of an individual ’ s HMO membership on the 
probability of receipt of various types of preventive services. After all, HMO stands 
for  “ health maintenance organization. ” So at least the rhetoric is that these orga-
nizations strive to keep their members well. Rizzo evaluated the relationship with 
eight alternative measures of preventive care and found that preventive care was 
more likely to be used by HMO members than by members of traditional health 
insurance plans. 
 Finally,  Aizer, Currie, and Moretti (2007)  investigated whether managed care 
harms the health of infants when enrollment in managed care is mandatory. The 
US state of California ’ s Medicaid program requires some pregnant women to be 
enrolled in managed care as a condition of coverage. The authors found that Med-
icaid managed care decreased the quality of prenatal care the women received and 
increased the rate of low-birth-weight infants, premature births, and infant deaths. 
At least in this case, health care providers responded to managed care incentives 
to reduce the costs of care by limiting services provided in a way that led to 
decreases in infant health. Perhaps there is a lesson here: that competition among 
managed care originations does not suffice to ensure quality when the persons 

456 
 Part II / Chapter 10
served are vulnerable and do not have the exit option of leaving a plan with which 
they are dissatisfied for another plan. On the other hand, there is some empirical 
evidence that is more favorable to Medicaid managed care as contrasted with Med-
icaid coverage provided on a fee-for-service basis.  Mitchell and Gaskin (2007)  
reported that caregivers of Medicaid children visiting fee-for-service providers 
encountered greater difficulty navigating the health care system. In particular, 
levels of comprehensive care plan assessment and primary care provider case 
management were seen to be better for Medicaid recipients seeking managed care 
than fee-for-service providers ( Mitchell and Gaskin 2007 ). 
 The Backlash against Managed Care 
 Much of the empirical evidence is quite favorable to managed care plans in general 
and to HMOs in particular. Nevertheless, from about the mid-1990s through the 
early 2000s, there was a backlash against such plans. Although most consumers 
generally were satisfied with the overall quality of managed care, the US public 
developed a general concern about the quality of such care ( Sloan and Hall 2002 ). 
Dissatisfaction appears to have stemmed from perceived restrictions on access to 
emergency room care, specialists, and other forms of care that may potentially be 
beneficial to individuals covered by such care. Physicians complained that they 
faced constraints on care decisions imposed by such plans. 
 In sum, curbing service use is painful, and much easier to talk about in 
general than when it actually applies to actual specific situations. The public 
does not like losing specific benefits, although traditional health insurance 
may impose a welfare loss on society more generally. No one represents the 
welfare loss. Consumers, by contrast, are good about representing the losses they 
incur as individuals. The backlash led to the enactment of managed care patient 
protection laws designed to reduce the ability of managed care organizations 
to constrain cost growth. Such laws included laws providing direct access to 
specialists without having to have prior authorization from a primary care 
physician gatekeeper, laws requiring minimum patient hospital stays for obstetric 
deliveries,  “ prudent layperson standards, ” which protect coverage for emergency 
room visits when in the judgment of a prudent layperson such care is warranted, 
and  “ any willing provider ” laws, which require plans to accept providers who 
apply to be covered — a direct assault on the concept of selective contracting. 
Overall, the enactment of patient protection laws neither affected the utilization 
of services nor improved patient satisfaction with care ( Sloan, Rattliff, and Hall 
2005 ). 
 Private Health Insurance and Universal Health Insurance 
Coverage 
 A system based on private health insurance coverage, even if subsidized, as it 
is in the United States, will not lead to coverage of the entire population unless 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 457
there are mandates for coverage and a public provision for disadvantaged groups 
in the population. The main reason why some public provision of insurance is 
needed is that not everyone is employed or is in a family with an employed 
individual. 
 One constant across countries is that people seem to like what they have. In 
a country in which most persons have private health insurance coverage, such as 
the United States, the most feasible proposals for universal health insurance cover-
age have been to extend private health insurance to previously uncovered individu-
als since this more closely resembles the status quo. 
 However, mandates that require employers to provide health insurance cover-
age to their employees may adversely affect employment, and the public provision 
of coverage to fill the gaps in coverage, will crowd out private insurance. If public 
insurance is available at less than actuarially fair premiums, employers and employ-
ees may find it optimal for employers to drop their private insurance benefit. Public 
health insurance plans charging actuarially fair premiums seems inconsistent with 
such programs ’ redistributional objectives. Understandably, the road from reliance 
on private health insurance to universal coverage is not well trod. 
 On the other hand, we need to be careful not to overemphasize the differences 
between private and public health insurance. Public provision in the form of social 
insurance (see chapter 12) does not eliminate the need for premium collection and 
basing premiums on forecasts of plan expenditures. In a self-funded public plan, 
younger persons would contribute more than their annual anticipated outlays in 
anticipation of higher outlays when they became older. 
 Public programs tend eschew such a self-funded approach in favor of pay-as-
you-go (PAYGO) financing in which the young in a given year cross-subsidize 
elders. PAYGO financing is attractive in the short run, but in the long run, financ-
ing problems almost surely ensue. As the percentage of elderly persons rises, not 
only does the payment obligation rise, but the fraction of younger persons who 
subsidize the more costly public program falls. Fewer young persons have a larger 
aggregate burden to bear.

 Summary and Conclusions 
 This chapter has discussed issues in the supply of health insurance markets and 
hence complements the discussion of demand in chapter 4 and of private health 
insurance systems in chapter 11. In chapter 4, we saw that risk-averse individuals 
are willing to pay more than the expected loss for protection against such loss. In 
this chapter, we have seen that by pooling individual risks, insurers can diversify 
away much of the risk of high loss from an adverse health event that people as 
uninsured individuals would face.

 Part II / Chapter 10
 Insurers have two basic flows of income, one from underwriting and the other 
from investments. Changes in the length of time insurers have to use policyholders ’ 
money for investment purposes and in anticipated rates of return from investment 
affect premiums. We made a distinction between diversifiable and nondiversifiable 
risk and argued that nondiversifiable risk in particular affects the rate of return 
even an insurer in a competitive market needs to stay in business. 
 One source of nondiversifiable risk is adverse selection. Insurers combat 
adverse selection in various ways, including refusing to underwrite some risks or 
renew the insurance policies of persons who incur substantial medical expendi-
tures during a policy year. 
 Health insurance is a subject in which the trade-off between allocative effi-
ciency and equity is particularly evident. In an efficient market, people would have 
accurate beliefs about the probability that they will use medical services during 
the year and the amounts they will use conditional on any use. Premiums would 
reflect an accurate assessment of policyholders ’ expected loss during the policy 
year. Thus, after a person experienced a health shock, premiums would rise to 
reflect the change in health risk. Thus, sick people would pay more for health 
insurance. Since all parties would have good information, there would be no role 
for government provision or the review of information provided by insurers to 
policyholders. There would be free entry and exit of insurers. Thus, individual 
policyholders would face a bankruptcy risk, but, since the market had good infor-
mation on solvency risk, presumably insurers with a higher bankruptcy risk would 
receive a lower premium than an insurer with a lower bankruptcy risk could. Thus, 
there would be no need for solvency regulation. Since the insurance market would 
be competitive, there would be no need for government oversight of premiums to 
offset private insurers ’ use of market power or to protect consumers from insurer 
insolvency. People would choose jobs based on their preferences for wages versus 
fringe benefits, of which health insurance is one. There would be no tax advantages 
to obtaining health insurance through one ’ s job. If people decided to forgo health 
insurance, they would be exposed to large losses from high health expenditures, 
but this would be the luck of the draw by an informed consumer population. 
 Clearly, at every turn, equity considerations interfere with an idealized world 
in which economic efficiency is the dominant guide for public policy. To the extent 
that consumers lack relevant information about the probability that they will be 
ill, the prices of care, how to read insurance contracts, and the trade-offs between 
wages and fringe benefits, there is a fairly broad consensus that government should 
intervene. Likewise, there is widespread agreement that a person who is unlucky 
in having the genetic background that he or she has should not be asked to pay the 
full price for the difference between being unlucky and being lucky in one ’ s genetic 
background. If insurers are able to exercise market power over either consumers 
or physicians and hospitals — that is, in situations in which economic efficiency is 
violated — government must be there as well. 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 459
 We do not take a position about the weight that should be given to these 
distributional concerns. Rather we have endeavored to describe and analyze them 
from the standpoint of economics.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 10.1  
 List three advantages that employer-based private health insurance has over 
individually purchased private health insurance. 
 10.2  
 What are the major advantages and disadvantages of private health insur-
ance compared to public health insurance? 
 10.3  
 Analyze the following statement:  “ The great importance of private health 
insurance sector is the major obstacle to implementing national (universal) 
health insurance in the United States. ” 
 10.4  
 In the context of private health insurance, what does the statement  “ this 
porridge is too hot ” mean? What are some policy concerns if this porridge 
is really too hot? What kind of regulations can government adopt to ensure 
that  “ this porridge is just right ” ? Does the government run a risk that  “ this 
porridge will become too cold ” ? Explain your answers. 
 10.5  
 It is often argued that employer-based health insurance places a heavy burden 
on employers, and hence US manufacturers are placed at a competitive dis-
advantage in the global market. Is this argument valid? Why or why not? 

460 
 Part II / Chapter 10
 10.6 
 Distinguish between demand-side and supply-side moral hazard. Why does 
each arise? 
 10.7 
 Explain the term  “ managed care ” in your own words. List at least four 
dimensions that make managed care plans different from traditional health 
insurance. 
 10.8 
 The mainstream consensus in the literature is that total health care spending 
in managed care plans tends to be about 10 – 15 percent lower compared to 
traditional health insurance plans. Identify the potential channels that help 
managed care plans save costs. Based on the existing evidence, how does 
managed care achieve these savings 
 10.9 
 Specifically how does managed care alter physicians ’ incentives? How 
might managed care plans reduce supply-side moral hazard? Is there a risk 
that incentives physicians face under managed care may lead to too little 
care being provided? Why might care levels be too low? What are the criteria 
for determining whether optimal levels of care are being provided or not? 
 10.10  What is a preferred provider organization? How do incentives to patients 
and physicians differ from the incentives of an HMO? 
 10.11  What is meant by selective contracting? How is selective contracting useful 
in achieving health care cost containment? 
 10.12  Distinguish among the types of managed care plans in the United States. 
 10.13  How might there be spillover effects from managed care to traditional health 
insurance plans? How do such spillovers affect the measurement of the 
comparative cost of managed care and traditional fee-for-service health 
insurance plans? 
 10.14  Specifically why would one expect that the diffusion of new health care 
technologies might be slower under managed care plans than under tradi-
tional health insurance plans? 
 Exercises 
 10.1  Define the profit function of the private insurer in the line of health insur-
ance. That is, what are the revenues and costs of the insurance firm? Based on your 
definition, please analyze the effects of the following exogenous changes on the 
insurer ’ s profit: 
 a.  an increase in interest rate; 
 b.  an increase in the insurer ’ s share price in the stock market; 

The Supply of Private Health Insurance 
 461
 c.  a general increase in health care expenditures; 
 d.   an increase in population size; 
 e.  an increase in the country ’ s unemployment rate; 
 f.   a shift of the payment system from fee-for-service to capitation. 
 10.2   Suppose country A adopts a public health insurance plan that provides 
coverage for various types of personal health care services, with moderate demand-
side cost sharing. Meanwhile, country A also allows private firms to offer health 
insurance for uncovered services and to pay for cost sharing of covered services. 
There are two types of private health insurance: (a) indemnity benefits that the 
insurance policy pays a fixed dollar amount for a particular type of service; 
(b) service benefits that the insurance policy pays a specific percentage of the out-
of-pocket price. Answer each of the following questions: 
 a.  What is meant by the statement that  “ private insurers  ‘ free ride ’ on public 
plans ” ? Which type of private health insurance is more like to become the free 
rider, indemnity or service benefit plans? Explain your answer. 
 b.  Which type of private health insurance (again, indemnity or service benefit) can 
provide better protection against the risk of financial loss when the insured is 
sick? 
 10.3   Explain the differences among the following three types of government 
intervention in the health insurance market: (1) public subsidy, (2) mandated insur-
ance benefits, and (3) direct public provision. If the goal of government intervention 
is to achieve universal coverage, which strategy is the best (most efficient) in terms 
of minimizing the deadweight loss? 
 10.4   As mentioned in this chapter, some insurers operate disease management 
programs that seek to promote prevention and screening in order to reduce adverse 
health outcomes of chronic disease and the associated expense. Does the incentive 
for such loss prevention differ between private insurers and public insurers? Which 
type of insurer is more likely to adopt a loss prevention program? Explain your 
answer. 
 10.5   Compare differences between public health insurance and private health 
insurance along the following dimensions: 
 a.  the decision to adopt new medical technologies; 
 b.  premium setting; 
 c.  administrative expense; 

462

 Private Financing of Health Care 
Services 
 Up to now, this book has discussed decision making at the individual and firm 
levels, either individuals as patients or individuals — physicians and nurses — as 
suppliers of health services, and hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and 
health insurers as firms. Part I (chapters 2 – 4) focused on the demand side of the 
health care market, while Part II (chapters 5 – 10) focused on the supply side of this 
market. In Part III, comprising chapters 11 through 13, we analyze resource alloca-
tion at the level of the market and consider interactions among various parties in the 
health care market, including patients as the demand side, providers as the supply 
side, and third-party payers, both private and public, which stand in the middle. 
 In this chapter ’ s first section, we explain the difference between analysis at 
the individual and firm levels (Parts I and II) and analysis at the market (system) 
level (Part III), which serves the purpose of providing a rationale for analysis of 
health systems.  1 We then explain the economic rationale for using shares of public 
financing and public supply as criteria for classifying health care globally. Based 
on the share of revenue from government sources and the share of hospitals oper-
ated by the public sector, we classify health care markets at a national level into 
four categories: (1) cash system, (2) private system, (3) quasi-public (or social insur-
ance) system, and (4) public system. 
 In section 3, we discuss how health care resources are allocated in a cash 
system using India and China as examples. In section 4, we discuss similar issues 
in a private system, using managed care in the United States as an example. (We 
discuss quasi-public systems in chapter 12 and public systems in chapter 13, 
respectively.) Section 5 describes managed competition, a concept that elicited 
widespread policy interest in the United States during the 1990s and among 
1.  In the following three 
chapters, we use 
 “ sys tem ”  and  “ market ” 
in terchangeably. Since 
the components of 
health care markets are 
more complicated than 
the components of 
markets in most other 
sectors, we use the term 
 “ system ”  to capture a 
broader concept that 
includes consumers, 
producers, third-party 
payers, and regulators, 
in contrast to the more 
standard concept of 
 “ market, ”  which 
includes only 
consumers and 
producers.

students of health care delivery worldwide. Managed care represents a general class 
of approaches for managing care for individual patients. By contrast, managed 
competition applies to an entire health care system. In section 6, we compare 
multiple-payer systems, the largest of which is in the United States, with single-
payer systems, common to many countries. Section 7 presents a summary and 
conclusions. 
 11.1 
 Rationale for Health Systems Analysis 
 In previous chapters, we used  partial equilibrium analysis , which involves analysis 
of the behavior of one decision maker, assuming the behavior of other market par-
ticipants remains constant. For example, we assumed that the behavior of suppli-
ers — physicians or hospitals — remained unchanged when we analyzed demand for 
health care services. Similarly, we assumed that consumer behavior as captured 
by the demand curve was fixed or exogenously determined when we analyzed 
physicians ’  decisions. In reality, the behaviors of other parties in a market do not 
typically remain unchanged. For example, government subsidies of vaccines 
increase demand for vaccines, and at the same time, increased market size stimu-
lates R & D on vaccines and entry of vaccine manufacturers. Thus, analysis at the 
system (market) level is needed in order to take the behaviors of all parties in the 
market into account. Economists refer to this approach as  general equilibrium 
analysis . 
 The difference between partial equilibrium (individual-level) and general 
equilibrium (market-level) analysis in the health care sector arises for three reasons. 
First, partial equilibrium analysis only considers the responses of one market par-
ticipant to changes in its circumstances. By contrast, general equilibrium analysis 
considers the responses of all market participants simultaneously. Second, partial 
equilibrium analysis is static in assuming that medical technology is given. 
However, in an environment in which medical technology changes rapidly, general 
equilibrium analysis, being dynamic, takes the impacts of technological change 
into account. Third, partial equilibrium analysis generally does not consider exter-
nalities, such as the spillover of treatment quality from one health care plan to 
another plan. General equilibrium analysis does incorporate these effects. 
 Whether or not one uses partial or general equilibrium analysis potentially 
has important implications for the analysis of the effects of health policies. Two 
examples serve to illustrate this point (  table 11.1 ).  
 The first example concerns the effectiveness of imposing demand-side cost 
sharing to control rising health care costs. Based on the results of the RAND Health 
Insurance Experiment (HIE), the implication is that demand-side cost sharing 
would be effective in health care cost control (see chapter 3).   Figure 11.1  shows 

Private Financing of Health Care Services 
 471
that the quantity of demand for health care is  x 0 when demand for personal health 
care services is represented by  D 1 and the country provides  “ free care ” through 
health insurance, that is, it does not impose co-payments on the users of such 
services. 
 However, such care is not really  “ free. ” In the figure, marginal cost is  p . Thus, 
the country spends 0 pAx 0 on health care. Now, suppose the country, seeking to 
reduce its outlays on these services, introduces demand-side cost sharing, as rep-
resented by  cp . The quantity of health care services demanded consequently

declines to  x 1 under a partial equilibrium analysis that ignores suppliers ’ reactions. 
This leads to a saving in spending, represented by the shaded area  ABx 1 x 0 . That 
imposing cost sharing would result in such a saving is supported by the evidence 
from the HIE (see chapter 3). 
 However, although the HIE has many important strengths and has been highly 
influential in both public policy and academic arenas, a criticism of the HIE is that 
it studied only consumer responses to changes in cost sharing and assumed that 
provider behavior would be unchanged if insurers introduced cost sharing. In 
chapter 5, we discussed the possibility that physicians may use their informational 
advantage to induce demand in order to offset the reduction in their demand. As 
seen in   figure 11.1 , the effect of demand-side cost sharing would be completely 
offset by physician-induced demand if such induced demand were to shift the 
demand curve to  D 2 . This suggests that the effect of demand-side cost sharing may 
be small or even nonexistent in a general equilibrium framework that considers 
both demand and supply sides simultaneously. Thus, in the real world, whether 
or not the effect of demand-side cost sharing could be as effective as the HIE sug-
gests it would be is an empirical question. The answer partly depends on provider 
responses to the policy change on the demand side.  
 A second example concerns the effect of introducing health insurance on 
spending on personal health care service via its effect on technological change. The 
implementation of health insurance can markedly increase market size, which in 
turn can lead to important changes in incentives to innovate and for health care 
suppliers to adopt these innovations. For example,  Finkelstein (2007)  found that 
the introduction of the US Medicare program led to substantial new hospital 
entry and new technology adoption. Finkelstein performed a comparison 
between partial equilibrium and general equilibrium effects of health insurance. 
According to the results from the HIE, she concluded that just in terms of the 
additional people covered by introducing Medicare in the United States, the static 
HIE findings would imply an increase in hospital spending of 5.6 percent. This 
result is consistent with a statement in  Newhouse (1992)  that the implementation 
of health insurance in the United States should not have led to substantial growth 
in national health expenditures in that country. However, in fact, the implementa-
tion of Medicare in 1966 was associated with a 37 percent increase in real (adjusted 
for general inflation) hospital expenditures between 1965 and 1970. This change 
is more than six times larger than what the evidence from the HIE would have 
predicted. 
 The distinction between partial equilibrium and general equilibrium effects 
of health insurance is illustrated in   figure 11.2 . Suppose a country ’ s demand for 
health care is represented by  D 1 and the equilibrium market price of health care in 
this country is  p 1 . Thus, this country spends 0 p 1 Ax 1 on health care if there is no 
health insurance, and it spends 0 p 1 Bx 2 on health care if it implements a health 
insurance system providing  “ free care ” to all its citizens. The introduction of such 

Private Financing of Health Care Services 
 473
a health insurance plan would lead to an increase in health expenditure in the 
amount indicated by the lightly shaded area,  Ax 1 x 2 B , under a static (partial equi-
librium) framework that assumes  “ other things remain constant. ”  
 However, as  Finkelstein (2007)  notes, a major expansion in health insurance 
coverage, which occurred when Medicare was introduced, would lead to market-
wide changes. The substantial increases in demand for care that lead to correspond-
ing increases in revenue are likely to be sufficient to more than offset the fixed cost 
of entry (e.g., building a new facility, obtaining regulatory approval for entry). Thus, 
because a major demand stimulus occurred, one could expect many providers to 
enter the market. Further, rates of return on medical research and development are 
likely to increase, leading to a substantial amount of technological change, which 
in health care has tended to lead to increased spending on services. 
 This effect is depicted by a shift in demand from  D 1 to  D 2 . New medical tech-
nology may increase the quality of hospital care and hence increase the demand for 
such care. In addition, the equilibrium market price of hospital care may increase 
(from  p 1 to  p 2 ) as hospitals adopt new medical technology and new practice styles. 
 National health expenditures would increase from the area 0 p 1 Ax 1 to the 
area 0 p 2 Cx 3 following the introduction of a  “ free care ” plan. The effect of introduc-
ing health insurance on the growth of health expenditures is represented by the 
dark shaded area ( p 2 Cx 3 x 2 Bp 1 ) plus the lightly shaded area ( Ax 1 x 2 B ), an amount

substantially larger than the policy impact predicted by the partial equilibrium 
analysis (light shaded area alone). 
 As   figure 11.2  illustrates, the introduction of health insurance is not a major 
factor in accounting for the long-run growth of health expenditures if we use a 
partial equilibrium approach that does not consider the responses of the supply 
side of the market. By contrast, health insurance could be a major source of growth 
in health expenditures if the policy change is evaluated with a general equilibrium 
framework. Using the latter approach,  Finkelstein (2007)  estimated the impact of 
implementing Medicare in the United States and concluded that the overall spread 
of health insurance between 1950 and 1990 could explain about half of the increase 
in US real health care expenditures over this time period. 
 The details of a general equilibrium impact are country-specific and depend 
on the characteristics of the country ’ s health care system. In the next section, we 
describe a method for classifying national health care systems. 
 11.2 
 Classification of Health Care Systems 
 Health care systems around the globe are very diverse. Thus, the task of classifying 
health care systems worldwide is not a straightforward exercise. Some previous 
attempts at classifying health care systems based their classifications on a single 
attribute, while others used two or more dimensions to achieve this goal.   Table 
11.2 shows examples of various classification criteria.  
 An advantage of a single-attribute classification criterion is that countries are 
assigned binary (1 – 0) categories that are relatively easy to compare.   Table 11.2  lists 
seven single-dimensional criteria widely used for comparing differences in health 
care systems internationally. 
 The first is whether or not countries use primary care physicians as gatekeep-
ers to influence the use of specialty and hospital inpatient care. Some countries 
allow patients to freely choose their own providers, while others impose various 
restrictions on provider choice through gatekeeper mechanisms. This type of mech-
anism requires a referral by a general practitioner or other primary care physician 
before other personal health care services, such as physician specialist services, 
can be covered by health insurance. 
 The second is whether or not a country ’ s government imposes a pre-set budget 
ceiling on its health care spending. Systems with budget ceilings, such as global 
budgeting, are often referred to as closed-ended financing systems, while systems 
without budget ceilings, such as in the United States, are often referred to as open-
ended financing systems. 
 A third criterion pertains to how hospitals pay their physicians. In some 
countries, physicians who practice in hospitals are employees of those hospitals, 
and physicians practicing in clinics do not have hospital admitting privileges. This 
is characterized as a closed-staff system (see chapter 6). By contrast, in other 

Private Financing of Health Care Services 
 475
countries, physicians practicing in clinics have admitting privileges at hospitals, 
an open-staff system. 
 The fourth distinction is based on citizens ’ financial access to personal health 
care services. Some countries provide universal health insurance coverage to all 
their citizens, while others provide coverage only to selected groups of their 
population. 
 Next, some countries finance most of their health expenditures through 
public funds, while others rely predominantly on private funds. In some countries, 
public hospitals are the major providers. By contrast, other countries rely on private 
hospitals to deliver most personal health care services. 
 A final attribute relates to the style of physician practice. For example, some 
countries, such as Japan, have an integrated health care system in which physicians 
both prescribe and dispense drugs. By contrast, physician dispensing is prohibited 
in countries where there is a separation between prescribing and dispensing for 
prescription drugs. 
 Using a single attribute to classify a health care system is too simple. A health 
care system reflects its several components, including financing, payment, organi-
zation, regulation, and behavior — the five control knobs (  fig. 11.3 ) for reforming a 
health care system ( Roberts, Hsiao, Berman, et al. 2004 ). Thus, on balance, it is 
more appropriate to use multiple-dimensional criteria, provided the classification 
system does not become unwieldy.

 A change in the position of any one of the five control knobs would imme-
diately affect health care system performance, as measured by various indicators 
such as efficiency (cost), quality, and access to services. These changes in turn 
affect long-term outcomes of the health care system, including population health. 
For example, an increase in public funds to finance personal health care services, 
such as implementing a national health insurance program, would immediately 
affect access to personal health care services among the target population, which 
in turn would affect the level of expenditure risk protection of the target popula-
tion. This framework is useful for evaluating the impact of reform policy on the 
intermediate and final performance of the health care system. But it is too complex 
for classifying health care systems because the five-dimensional criteria would lead 
to many possible combinations. 
 Therefore, we use the two dimensions of government activity in health care 
financing and in delivery to describe the gamut of options for a country ’ s health 
care system. A two-dimension criterion represents a compromise between being 
 “ too simple ” or  “ too complex ” when single-and multiple-dimensional criteria are 
utilized, respectively. The two-dimensional criterion forms a two-by-two matrix 
yielding four categories (  table 11.2 ). 
 The first dimension describes the extent to which the system relies on public 
financing. Sources of funds for financing personal health care services fall into four 
major categories: (1) out-of-pocket payments, (2) private health insurance premi-
ums, (3) general tax revenue, and (4) earmarked tax revenue specifically tied to 
spending on personal health care services, including social health insurance pre-
miums, payroll taxes, and social security taxes specifically earmarked for health 
care services. The first two sources come from private sources, while the latter two 
are mandatory assessments based on public law. In effect, we measure the extent 
of government involvement in health care financing by the share of public funds 
in a country ’ s total funds allocated to personal health care services, hereafter 
referred to as the public financing share. 
 Data from 166 countries (  fig. 11.4 ) show the relationship between national 
income (as measured by gross domestic product [GDP] per capita population) and 
share of public financing. With a few exceptions, the share of public financing is 
positively related to a country ’ s level of national income. A regression with the 
dependent variable the country ’ s public financing share and the explanatory vari-
able the country ’ s GDP per capita population, both expressed in natural logarithm 
form, indicates that a 10 percent increase in GDP per capita leads on average to an 
increase in the public financing share of 1.2 percent. The major outlier is the United 
States, which relies more extensively on private health insurance for financing 
personal health care services than is predicted by its GDP per capita population.  
 Table 11.3  shows the global distribution of national public financing shares. 
The mode of this distribution is in the range of 40 – 50 percent. At one extreme, 
there are three countries with public sector percentages below 20 percent, 

478 
 Part III / Chapter 11
including Cambodia, Congo and Guinea. At the other extreme, twenty-six countries 
have public sector percentages exceeding 80 percent. Most of the latter are high-
income countries, such as Denmark, the UK, and Japan.  
 The second dimension we use for classifying health care systems is the extent 
to which the government is involved in the provision of personal health care ser-
vices. In many countries, governments play a direct role in providing personal 
health care services; most hospitals in these countries are public. By contrast, 
private hospitals are predominant in some other countries, with public hospitals 
limited to providing services for selected population groups, such as veterans and 
low-income individuals. We measured the extent of government involvement in 
health care delivery by the share of public hospitals in a country ’ s hospital sector, 
hereafter referred to the public supply share. 
 Data from twenty-one high-income countries show the relationship between 
national income, measured by GDP per capita of population, and public supply 
shares (  fig. 11.5 ). In contrast to the public financing share, there is no clear pattern 
between countries ’ public supply shares and their national per capita incomes. 
Rather than being related to national income, the choice of public supply share 
seems to reflect such factors as historical context, culture, and social values.  
 Table 11.4  shows national public financing and public supply shares. Since 
data on the latter are unavailable for many countries, the number of countries 
reported is limited to some high-income countries. Data on public financing and 
supply shares are plotted in   figure 11.6 , where the extent of public financing from

 Figure 11.6 
 The Relationship between Public Financing Share and the Public Supply Share 
low to high is on the horizontal axis and the extent of direct public provision is 
on the vertical axis. Using 50 percent cutoffs to categorize countries as  “ high ”  or 
 “ low ”  in public versus private financing and  “ high ”  or  “ low ”  in direct public pro-
vision of care, there are four quadrants, corresponding to our four health system 
categories.  
 The upper right quadrant in figure 11.6 contains systems relatively high in 
public financing from general tax revenue and earmarked payroll taxes  and  relatively 
high in public (hospital) provision; they include Great Britain, Canada, and the Scan-
dinavian countries. For simplicity, we call these  “ public systems ” (  table 11.5 ).  
 The upper left quadrant includes countries in which the government operates 
hospitals as public institutions but primarily relies on private financing, for 
example, China, India, and many low-income countries. Since data on shares of 
public supply for many low-income countries are lacking, we cannot be precise 
about this in   figure 11.6 . But these countries tend to have a low share of public 
financing (  table 11.3 ) and a high share of public supply, placing them in this quad-
rant. We term these  “ cash systems ” because of the importance of out-of-pocket 
payments in these countries. 
 The lower left quadrant includes countries in which the private sector plays 
a dominant role in financing in the form of private health insurance and in the 
delivery of personal health care services, for example, the United States, where 

482 
 Part III / Chapter 11
more than half of the population has private employer-provided health insurance 
and more than 70 percent of hospitals are privately owned and operated. We term 
this a  “ private system. ” 
 In the lower right quadrant, the public sector finances health care through 
compulsory social insurance and the private sector is primarily responsible for the 
provision of services. Some countries provide social insurance for the entire popu-
lation, while others limit such insurance coverage to certain population groups, 
such as civil servants, wage sector employees, and those with monthly earnings 
below a specific threshold. Countries in this category include Germany, Japan, 
South Korea, and Taiwan. Also, the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United 
States and the new social insurance program in China belong in this category. We 
term this system a  “ quasi-public ”  or a  “ social insurance system. ” 
 The coexistence of alternative models of health care systems, even for coun-
tries at comparable levels of economic development, suggests that there is no 
consensus on the optimal mix of public financing and public supply. For example, 
Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan shared a similar experience in 
terms of economic growth during 1960 – 2010, but their health care systems evolved 
very differently during this period ( Wagstaff 2007 ). 
 The choice of health system affects a country ’ s distribution of income. Income 
distribution is affected both by the relative burden a country ’ s method of health care

financing imposes on households with varying incomes and by patterns of use of 
services by income. Costs incurred and benefits received are measured in terms of 
 “ progressivity/regressivity. ”  If the system leads to a more equal distribution of 
income, it is considered to be progressive. Conversely, if less affluent households 
bear a relatively high share of payments or receive fewer benefits, the system is 
regressive. Research on European and Asian health care systems indicates that cash 
systems in low-income countries tend to be progressive in that the relatively affluent 
pay more but also receive more health care services. Systems in high-income coun-
tries that rely substantially on private health insurance, such as the United States 
and Switzerland, tend to be regressive. Systems we term  “ public ”  tend to be the 
most progressive, and quasi-public systems tend to be somewhat regressive. The 
main reason why quasi-public systems impose less redistribution from higher- to 
lower-income families than the public systems do is that general tax revenues tend 
to impose a higher relative burden on the relatively affluent than do social insurance 
premiums, which are more likely to be set in direct proportion to income ( Wagstaff 
and van Doorslaer 1992 ;  O’Donnell, van Doorslaer, Rannan-Eliya, et al. 2008 ). 
 Based on the two-dimensional criterion, our analysis of health care systems 
is focused on four systems represented by the four quadrants ( table 11.5 ). In this 
chapter, we start our discussion of health system classification with descriptions 
of cash and private systems (upper left and lower left quadrants). However, the 
major source of private financing differs between these two systems: the cash 
system mainly relies on out-of-pocket payments, while the private system relies 
substantially on private health insurance. In addition, relatively speaking, the cash 
system relies on public provision to deliver personal health care services, while 
the insured private system relies on private provision for service delivery. Systems 
described by the lower right quadrant, private provision and public insurers, and 
the upper right quadrant, public provision  and financing, are discussed in chapters 
12 and 13, respectively. 
 Countries differ in having single-payer versus multiple-payer systems. For 
example, in the United States, private health insurance accounts for much health 
care financing, but about half of the financing is from public sources, specifically 
from Medicare and Medicaid. Thus, we split the health care system in the United 
States into two parts, an insured private system and a quasi-public system. 
 Similarly, China (like some other countries) does not fit neatly into a single 
category. China currently relies substantially on out-of-pocket costs payments and 
in this respect fits the cash category, but this country has also begun to expand the 
coverage of social insurance programs. Thus, we also split the health care system 
into two parts, a cash system and a quasi-public system. 
 Our analysis treats a country ’ s system as exogenous. We do not analyze how 
national health care systems are shaped and why they have evolved in the ways 
that they have. Since we take health systems as given, we do not provide detailed 
accounts of the history of individual countries ’ health systems. Once in place,

health systems develop important constituencies that benefit from maintaining the 
status quo. Changes have occurred, for example, as a consequence of major changes 
in political systems such as in countries that belonged to the former Soviet Union 
and China. Yet even when major political upheavals have occurred, as in Germany 
between 1933 and 1945, when National Socialists controlled the government, and 
were succeeded by a communist regime in East Germany, a reunified Germany 
created after the fall of the communist regimes returned to the basic health system 
structure that had prevailed before 1933. 
 We employ the paradigm of structure-conduct-performance used in the indus-
trial organization literature (the branch of economics that studies the effects of 
market structure on firms ’ performance) to assess how each type of health care 
system affects choices, which in turn affect price, quantity, quality, health expen-
ditures, and innovation.  2 
 11.3 
 Cash Systems 
 Overview 
 Many countries, especially low- and some middle-income countries, rely exten-
sively on direct out-of-pocket payments as the principal source of health services ’ 
financing. In some countries, official user fees have been adopted, in large part to 
mitigate the risk of high health expenditure risk to citizens of those countries. But 
there is evidence that providers often obtain fees far in excess of the officially 
sanctioned fees. 
 Perkins, Brazier, Themmen, et al. (2009) presented evidence on fees for labor 
and delivery in three African countries, Kenya, Burkina Faso, and Tanzania, 
showing that direct out-of-pocket costs to families were substantial. A survey of 
out-of-pocket cost of care in fourteen Asian countries and territories accounting 
for 81 percent of the Asian population likewise showed that users of health care 
services incur substantial out-of-pocket obligations ( van Doorslaer, O ’ Donnell, 
Rannan-Eliya, et al. 2007 ) even when they receive care from public facilities. Of 
the countries the authors considered, out-of-pocket payments as a percentage of 
household non-food consumption was relatively high in Bangladesh (10.7 percent), 
India (10.7 percent), and Vietnam (12.6 percent), and relatively low in Hong Kong 
(3.4 percent, a high-income territory), Malaysia (2.1 percent), and Thailand (2.9 
percent). China was in between (5.3 percent). 
 Although exposure to high levels of out-of-pocket health expenditure risk 
clearly exacts a toll on risk-averse populations, and there is a risk that people will 
invest too little in preventive care in such countries, there is a silver lining. When 
people pay for care out of pocket, the welfare loss from moral hazard is averted; 
also, individuals who pay out of pocket may be more prone to monitor quality and 
insist that care delivery be efficient. 
2.  Although with few 
exceptions, we do not 
describe the system in a 
specific country in 
substantial detail, 
grouping countries by 
health sys  tem type 
offers several 
advantages. First, 
we can make 
generalizations about a 
common set of issues 
facing specific types of 
health care systems 
without getting mired 
in details of the specific 
attributes of each 
countries health 
system. Second, health 
care systems can 
change rapidly in terms 
of particulars, but the 
general orientation of 
particu lar health 
system types generally 
changes more slowly.

Private Financing of Health Care Services 
 485
 However, as the case studies reveal, the actual performance of cash systems 
is quite mixed. While there are examples of high-quality and efficient provision of 
care, there is much evidence of the opposite as well. 
 The Indian Health Care System 
 India substantially relies on direct payments from patients to providers for services 
rendered. In 1999, total spending on personal health care services in India was 6.0 
percent of GDP, of which 75 percent, or 4.5 percent of GDP, was for health expen-
ditures from private, out-of-pocket sources ( Bhat 1999 ). Another estimate, for 2001, 
is that public health expenditure accounted for 17.9 percent of total health expen-
diture in India ( Rahman 2008 ). This compares to 17.8 percent in Myanmar, 25.1 
percent in Indonesia, and 29.7 percent in Nepal, but to 90.6 percent in Bhutan, 
83.5 percent in the Maldives, and 73.4 percent in North Korea ( Rahman 2008 ). 
Overall, India is an outlier in terms of the low share of total personal health care 
expenditures from public sources ( Singh 2008 ). Its health indicators are somewhat 
better than for low-income countries overall, but they are lower than China ’ s and 
middle-income countries ’ health indicators overall (  table 11.6 ).  
 Funding by Indian states is more than twice that by the central government. 
Local governments contribute very little to public spending (much less than 10 
percent;  Singh 2008 ). Per capita public spending by Indian states during 1971, 
1981, and 1991 rose with state per capita GDP, but the associated elasticity was far

less than one; that is, a 10 percent increase in per capita GDP led to a far less than 
10 percent increase in public expenditures on personal health care services. States 
with higher rates of literacy also allocated more public funds to personal health 
care services ( Rahman 2008 ). 
 One estimate is that only 3 – 5 percent of Indians are covered by any form of 
health insurance ( Bloom, Kanjilal, and Peters 2008 ). Other estimates are that 11 – 15 
percent of the population has insurance coverage. The higher estimates do not 
change the essential conclusion that the vast majority of Indians lack health insur-
ance of any kind ( Bhattacharya and Sapra 2008 ;  Yip and Hslao 2008 ). India ’ s health 
insurers do not question the appropriateness of fees charged by hospitals, labora-
tories, or physicians ( Chandra 2010 ); unlike in the United States, their collective 
market share is so low that tough payment policies would not influence the price 
and quantity of care in India even if insurers were to become more aggressive in 
cost containment. More than half of India ’ s hospitals were private in 2004 (58 
percent in rural areas and 62 percent in urban areas). Four-fifths of outpatient 
utilization in the same year was in private clinics ( Bloom, Kanjilal, and Peters 
2008 ). Several major systems of medicine coexist in India, including allopathic 
medicine (Western medicine), ayurveda, unani, siddha, and homeopathy ( Berman 
1998 ). 
 Public oversight of health care in India is the responsibility of the states and 
territories rather than the central government. Central government efforts at influ-
encing public health have focused on the five-year plans, coordinated planning 
with the states, and sponsoring major health programs. 
 Interestingly, while the existence of a cash market has adverse consequences —
 it is not good for population health and serves to perpetuate health disparities 
within the population — a positive feature is that the lack of regulation of price and 
entry has probably facilitated the entry of some facilities that offer excellent quality 
of care at a low cost. Some examples are the two heart hospitals described in   box 
11.1 . Care from facilities of this type is inaccessible to a large portion of the Indian 
population; such facilities are primarily used by Indians with relatively high 
incomes and by foreigners. The majority of the Indian population is unable to 
access high-quality health care provided by private providers as a result of high 
prices and widespread lack of health insurance. Low quality of care is a major 
problem in India (see, e.g.,  Das and Hammer 2006 ).  
 The Chinese Health Care System 
 While most of China ’ s population lacks health insurance and high rates of out-of-
pocket payment prevail in China as in India, although to a lesser extent, this was 
not the case in China several decades ago ( Blomquist and Qian 2008 ). The Chinese 
health care system has experienced several fundamental changes during the past 
six decades, during which the health system in China at one time or another 
resembled almost all major health system options (  table 11.7 ). After the communist 

Private Financing of Health Care Services 
 487
revolution in 1949 and before economic reforms were instituted in 1978, rural 
residents mostly belonged to agricultural communes and had access to basic 
primary care and, on referral to hospitals, care at a low out-of-pocket cost to the 
individual, which was known as the Cooperative Medical Scheme (CMS). 
Residents of urban areas had access to subsidized care through their employers, 
which were either the government or a state-owned enterprise (Labor Insurance 
Scheme [LIS] and Government Insurance Scheme [GIS]). During this central plan-
ning era, China adopted a public health systems model. Out-of-pocket payments 
were minimal. Equal access to health care contributed substantially to improved 
population health. During the 1950s to the 1970s, China experienced better perfor-
mance in improving population health than did other countries with the same 
income (  table 11.6 ).  
 Box 11.1 
 Two Heart Hospitals in India 
 Richman, Udayakumar, Mitchell, et al. (2008 ) describe two heart hospitals in India 
that offer open heart surgery for about $6,000 a case, compared to $100,000 per case 
in the United States. The authors assert that the quality of care in the Indian facilities 
is comparable to that in the United States. How do the Indian hospitals achieve high 
quality of care at such a low cost? 
 The simplest answer would be low input prices in India. While this may be so for 
labor inputs, the difference in input prices cannot explain the entire difference in 
prices between the two countries. For one, the differences are likely to be greatest in 
labor inputs. The Indian hospitals have to obtain at least some of their equipment on 
world markets. 
 There are other plausible reasons for the price difference. Most important, patients 
in Indian hospitals pay cash for surgery, whereas in the United States, the surgery is 
largely paid by private or public insurers. In the end, the demand response of out-of-
pocket consumers is greater than for insured consumers — much greater, in fact — and 
also greater than for insurers acting in the role of purchasers for patients. When 
patients are paying the bill, health care providers are likely to be much more cautious 
about supplying services for which marginal benefit is low relative to marginal cost. 
Patients at risk of overruns are likely to be much more insistent that such overruns 
do not occur. Not surprisingly, the hospitals offered open heart surgery for a fixed 
price per operation as a means of assuring patients that overruns would not occur. In 
a piece rate system, which applies to some hospital inpatient care in the United States, 
more pieces (e.g., billing for each diagnostic [e.g., x-rays, MRIs] and therapeutic service 
[e.g., pills, respiratory therapy]) mean more revenue for the institution. Not surpris-
ingly, then, a higher than expected number of pieces is a frequent occurrence. 
 Does the efficiency-enhancing feature of a cash system imply that it is preferable 
from the standpoint of social welfare? We leave the analysis of this question to our 
readers. 

488 
 Part III / Chapter 11
 However, government insurance financing of personal health care services 
was substantially reduced with the market-oriented reforms that began in 1978. 
These reforms, which affected the general Chinese economy, led to a dismantling 
of the rural commune system and the conversion of many state-owned enterprises 
to private businesses. Public subsidies of government hospitals decreased. The 
government changed its financing and payment method to block grants, but with 
the size of the block grants generally much less than the grant recipient ’ s operating 
costs ( Ma, Lu, and Quan 2008 ). Privatization had adverse consequences for popula-
tion health as well, increasing health disparities well beyond what they otherwise 
would have been ( Blumenthal and Hsiao 2005 ).

 The CMS collapsed during this market-oriented era, and many residents of 
rural areas lost the safety net for medical expense available earlier. Similarly, the 
coverage afforded by the two other public insurance programs, the LIS and GIS, 
declined as a result of cutbacks in public financing. In response to the decline in 
public coverage, in 1995 the government launched a new public program, known as 
Basic Medical Insurance (BMI), which aims to cover all urban formal sector workers. 
 Nevertheless, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the percentage of 
the population with access to some form of health insurance coverage was appre-
ciably lower than during the central planning era. In 2003, 44 percent of urban 
residents and 79 percent of rural residents lacked health insurance ( Blomquist and 
Qian 2008 , 8). Even so, on several measures the health of urban residents was 
substantially worse in urban areas than in rural areas of China during 1997 – 2006 
( Fang, Chen, and Rizzo 2009 ). 
 As a result of the collapse of the CMS and the decline in insurance coverage 
by the two other public insurance programs, households increasingly had to rely 
on out-of-pocket payments to finance health care expenditures. The share of out-
of-pocket payments in total expenditures increased from 20.4 percent in 1978 to 
about 60 percent in 2000 (  fig. 11.7 ). Although the out-of-pocket payment share 
began to decline after 2000, it remained at a very high level throughout the

following decade, at over half of personal health care expenditures. The economic 
reform that began in 1978 led to a shift from a public system to a cash system, 
where it remained at the turn of the twenty-first century. Yet although China has 
a high out-of-pocket share, in India, the share paid out of pocket remains consider-
ably higher, around 80 percent ( Bhattacharya and Sapra 2008 , 1006).  
 Reliance on a cash system in China (a high out-of-pocket share) has had 
several adverse consequences. First, the lack of coverage is reflected in high prob-
abilities of families incurring catastrophic medical expense in a year. In 2003, an 
estimated 14 percent of urban households and 16 percent of rural households 
incurred such catastrophic expense, defined in a study by  Liu, Rao, Wu, et al. 
(2008 ) as an out-of-pocket medical expense in the year exceeding 30 percent of the 
family ’ s annual nonsubsistence spending — equal to total household spending 
minus subsistence food expenditure. 
 Second, the transition from the public system to a cash system created 
inequalities in health and health care utilization. For example, recent evidence has 
suggested that the difference in insurance coverage between the urban and rural 
populations has led to a widening gap in health status and utilization between 
urban and rural residents ( Wagstaff, Yip, Lindelow, et al. 2009 ). 
 Third, the reduction in insurance coverage and the increase in out-of-pocket 
payments have led to a slowdown in health improvement.  Wagstaff and colleagues 
(2009 ) documented that during the central planning era, China experienced a major 
improvement in population health, as measured by a dramatic reduction in mortality. 
However, this reduction did not continue after the introduction of market reforms. 
 Based on evidence from a cross-country regression relating a country ’ s under-
age-five mortality rate to its lagged mortality rate and per capita income, China was 
an overperformer; its rate of reduction exceeded its expected rate during the 1960s 
and 1970s. By contrast, China became an underperformer in the 1980s and 1990s. 
 In sum, market economic reforms in China have had several adverse impacts 
on health care and health in that country, including a slowdown in health improve-
ments, high rates of catastrophic out-of-pocket spending, and increased inequalities 
in health and health care utilization ( Wagstaff, Yip, Lindelow, et al. 2009 ). Respond-
ing to these multiple challenges, the Chinese government initiated health care 
reform plans starting in 2003. The major thrust of these reforms has been to move 
China ’ s health care system from essentially a cash system to a quasi-public system. 
Specifically, the government plans to allocate additional funds to the health sector 
to expand insurance coverage, with a target of achieving universal coverage by 
2011. Universal insurance coverage is to be achieved through three new insurance 
programs: (1) the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) for the rural popula-
tion, (2) the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance Scheme (URBMI) for the 
urban uninsured, and (3) Medical Assistance for the poorest and most vulnerable 
population in rural and urban areas (  table 11.7 ). We discuss the NCMS and analyze 
its effects in chapter 12.

 11.4  The Private System: The US Experience 
 Base Case: Private Provision and No Insurance Coverage 
 In the early twentieth century and before, the US population lacked health insur-
ance of any kind and paid for personal health care services out of pocket. Health 
services provision was overwhelmingly private. The disadvantages and advantages 
of this approach are those of a cash system. 
 Evolution of Private Health Insurance in the 1930s and 1940s 
 Private health insurance was first introduced in the United States in the 1930s and 
1940s. The major impetus for expanding coverage during the 1930s was the Great 
Depression. When personal incomes fell during the Great Depression, physicians 
and hospitals found it increasingly difficult to collect fees from patients, many of 
whom were unemployed. As a result, partly or largely out of self-interest, hospitals 
joined forces in forming Blue Cross plans, nonprofit insurance plans for hospital 
services. And physicians helped form Blue Shield plans, which provided coverage 
for physicians ’ services. Blue Cross reimbursed hospitals on a retrospective cost or 
charge basis (see chapter 6). Blue Shield paid physicians on a fixed-fee basis. In 
some states, Blue Shield was able to require that its fixed-fee payment be accepted 
by physicians participating in the Blue Shield program as payment in full. As with 
US Medicaid (see chapter 5), a physician who accepted Blue Shield payment could 
not  “ balance bill ” patients with such insurance for the difference between the 
physician ’ s usual fee and the amount that Blue Shield paid. 
 During the early 1940s, a major impetus for the growth of private health 
insurance plans was the wage and price controls implemented during World War 
II, which limited the wage increases that could be offered to employees. Health 
insurance and other fringe benefits were not considered to be part of wage com-
pensation. Nonwage compensation was not subject to personal income taxation. 
Thus, from the outset, such compensation was subsidized under the US tax code. 
 The nature of private health insurance in the United States has changed mark-
edly since the 1940s. Traditional plans with no elements of managed care are now 
rare. 3 Yet some aspects of managed care with the most promise in achieving cost 
containment met widespread opposition, particularly in the 1990s (see chapter 10). 
 11.5  The Managed Competition Model 
 Another casualty of the mid-1990s in the United States was the  managed competi-
tion model, a concept originally developed in the 1970s. This model is worth 
discussing, however, since it is down (in popularity) but not out as a policy option 
for the future. 
3.  See chapter 10 for a 
detailed description of 
managed care in the 
United States.

492 
 Part III / Chapter 11
 The overall goal of managed competition is to obtain quantity and quality of 
care at the point at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost, where marginal 
cost does not embody the inefficiencies inherent in the current system. Managed 
competition has several key features. 
 First, following Alain  Enthoven (1993) , who conceptualized managed com-
petition, is the notion of the sponsor, which may be an employer, government 
agency, labor/management health welfare trust, or other organization representing 
individuals who do not have access to another sponsor. A sponsor establishes rules 
for the equitable treatment of all persons eligible for insurance under its jurisdic-
tion, selects and contracts with health plans, manages the enrollment process, 
creates a market in which demand facing individual providers is elastic, and 
manages risk selection. 
 Equitable treatment is achieved by implementing the following types of rules: 
no exclusion from coverage because of preexisting health conditions and guaran-
teed renewal of coverage. The sponsor pays a fixed dollar subsidy per insured 
individual roughly equivalent to per enrollee cost in the lowest-cost plan. If the 
individual selects a more expensive plan, he or she bears the additional premium 
as an out-of-pocket expense. No one pays an additional premium on account of 
adverse health. 
 Sponsors can select which health plans will be offered to the individuals they 
sponsor. As  Enthoven (1993)  noted, a private employer may have a greater choice 
of plan — that is, may be able to exclude more plans — than a public employer. An 
insurance purchasing cooperative, organized specifically to offer health insurance 
in a locality, is likely to have even less choice of plan since it is likely to be tied 
to a specific geographic area. 
 A sponsor manages the enrollment process; individual subscribers notify the 
sponsor of their choice of plan, and this information is conveyed to the specific 
health plan the subscriber selects. The sponsor defines enrollment procedures and 
oversees the enrollment process to ensure that equitable enrollment practices are 
maintained. The sponsor has responsibility for communicating pertinent features 
of each plan, including out-of-pocket premiums and cost sharing at the point of 
service to potential subscribers. 
 Sponsors create price-elastic demand. They accomplish this by making a 
fixed dollar contribution to the purchase of each plan. Thus, if a plan has a higher 
quality (coverage)-adjusted premium, individuals will select another plan. The 
price sensitivity of consumers puts pressure on the plan to negotiate tough bargains 
with providers who become part of their networks. To allow individuals to make 
 “ apples-to-apples ”  comparisons, plan features should be standardized. When there 
are differentiating features, these should be explicitly identified so that direct 
comparisons of features and premium differences can be made. Health outcomes 
from each plan should be reported in a standardized way so that any differences 
in outcomes are clear to individuals who make choices among the sponsored health 

Private Financing of Health Care Services 
 493
plans. As managed care is conceptualized, premiums paid out of pocket by indi-
viduals should be fully taxable, avoiding the tax subsidy of generous coverage that 
exists in the United States currently (see chapter 10). Some empirical evidence 
indicates that the choice of health plan is premium-elastic (see  Buchmueller and 
Feldstein 1997  for the United States and  Tamm, Tauchmann, Wasem, et al. 2007  
for Germany). 
 Sponsors manage risk selection to ensure that some plans do not obtain dis-
proportionate shares of the healthiest individuals, thereby leaving less healthy 
individuals to other health plans.  4 Achieving this objective requires some form of 
risk adjustment. That is, the sponsor pays plans additional amounts on behalf of 
less healthy individuals so that the amounts in premiums paid by individuals do 
not vary by health risk and health plans have an incentive to improve quality, 
patient satisfaction, and efficiency rather than to profit by selecting the favorable 
health risks. 
 Large employers, those with 10,000+ employees, are of sufficient size to be 
effective sponsors. However, smaller employers and other groups may be insuffi-
ciently large to serve as sponsors. To deal with this issue, the managed care model 
employs health insurance purchasing cooperatives (HIPCs). HIPCs would contract 
with employers and other groups to perform the functions of a sponsor. They are 
likely to be organized as private not-for-profit organizations. HIPCs, like other 
sponsors, would not bear risk. Under managed competition, health plans bear risk. 
Managed competition was seriously considered in 1994 by the Clinton administra-
tion. The proposal died in the US Congress for various political reasons. In part, 
the Clinton proposal was unsuccessful because in the interest of creating a level 
playing field, the proposal became so complex that it resembled the complex regu-
latory systems that it was not supposed to be. It is difficult to know whether 
managed competition failed the political test in general or whether it was particular 
features of the proposal and the way it was marketed that failed. 
 Robinson (2003)  and others have taken the view that managed competition 
itself failed the test. In Robinson ’ s words,  “ managed competition demanded too 
much individual restraint and too much joint collaboration on the part of both the 
public and private sectors ” (ibid., 343). As a specific example, he noted that 
employers were to offer several health plans under managed competition. However, 
employers have not generally shown an inclination to do this. They not only con-
tinue to offer few plans but often subsidize expensive plans more than less expen-
sive ones, thus giving plans little incentive to cut their costs and ultimately their 
premiums. 
 Another type of criticism of managed competition is that payers and provid-
ers would have unequal bargaining power. In Germany, for example, providers and 
payers conduct collective bargaining at the state level. In the United States, by 
contrast, such collective bargaining is illegal. It is illegal for providers to form 
groups for the sole purpose of negotiating terms of contracts with health plans. 
4.  The empirical 
evidence on whether or 
not managed care plans 
in general and HMOs 
in particular obtain a 
favorable mix of 
enrollees from the 
standpoint of health 
status is mixed, 
although views on this 
point are strongly held 
by various stakeholders. 
 Mello, Stearns, Norton, 
et al. (2003) , for 
example, in studying 
the issue of biased 
selection in US 
Medicare HMOs, found 
some evidence of 
favorable selection on 
some but not all 
measures. Controlling 
for risk selection into 
Medicare HMOs,  Mello, 
Stearns, and Norton 
(2002)  found that 
Medicare HMOs 
significantly reduced 
the probability of 
hospitalization and the 
number of days in the 
hospital conditional on 
a hospital admission. 
But they found no 
effect on the use of 
physicians ’  services. 
Using data from the 
2000 Medical 
Expenditure Panel 
Survey to study 
selection into private 
HMO plans in the 
United States,  Shin and 
Moon (2007)  found 
empirical evidence of 
favorable selection into 
HMO plans.

 Comparisons between Single- and Multiple-
Payer Systems 
 In many countries, a single health insurance plan is responsible for financing 
health care, while in other countries, especially some of the more populous ones, 
such as the United States and China, there are many health insurance plans. With 
multiple insurance plans, health care providers receive payment from various 
sources, private, public, or a combination of the two. Single-payer systems tend to 
have an advantage on various dimensions of the cost of care. By contrast, multi-
payer systems can better satisfy heterogeneous preferences within a country ’ s 
population. Although this an advantage, and there may be others — for example, 
multipayer systems are probably less likely to stifle innovation in health care — the 
multipayer system may generate some negative and positive externalities that 
would not occur under a single-payer system. Three types of externalities are (1) 
cost shifting from some payers to others, (2) the shifting of patients from some 
payers to others, and (3) other spillover effects. The first two involve negative exter-
nalities and the third (briefly discussed above) involves a positive externality. 
 Cost Shifting 
 In a competitive market as under managed competition, payers compete for cus-
tomers by offering insurance at low quality-adjusted prices. However, insurers may 
differ in market power. A large insurer is likely to be in a better position to negotiate 
lower prices of services with providers than is a small insurer or, even more so, an 
uninsured individual who pays for care out of pocket. Cost shifting occurs when a 
reduction in service price to one payer results in a higher service price to others. 
At first glance, it might appear that this is one of competition ’ s strong points. Com-
petitive forces eliminate the inefficient competitors, in this context health insurers 
that fail to negotiate low prices with providers. But this may be highly undesirable 
if the individual  “ competitor ”  is an individual patient or a small group of insured 
persons, such as the employees of a small business. Furthermore, eliminating the 
small participants in a health insurance market may leave the market to one or a 
few large insurers, who then possess market power to set premiums at a high level. 
 Cost shifting as defined here differs from price discrimination as described 
in chapter 5. In price discrimination, a reduction in one seller ’ s price results in a 
reduction in other sellers ’ prices, not price increases. 
 In the model of cost-shifting behavior described by  Dranove, Simon, and 
White (1998 ), a nonprofit hospital that maximizes utility with output and profits 
as arguments of the utility function, there are two payers, a public payer and 
a private payer. A reduction in the price the public payer pays to the hospital 
results in an increase in price to the private payer under two conditions. First, the 
hospital must have market power in its private sector product market. Second, the 
market power must not have been fully exploited before the public payer reduced 

Private Financing of Health Care Services 
 495
the price it paid hospitals. That is, the hospital did not set price at the profit-
maximizing price before the public payer decreased price. The intuition is that the 
hospital raises its price toward the profit-maximizing price to make up for the 
shortfall caused by the fall in the price paid for hospital care by the public payer. 
 In Dranove, Simon, and White ’ s empirical analysis, the public payer is the 
US state of Illinois ’ Medicaid program. This program substantially reduced its pay-
ments to hospitals in the early 1980s. Dranove, Simon, and White found that for 
each $1  decrease in hospital profits (which can be negative) from serving Medicaid 
recipients per private admission there was a 51 cent  increase in hospital price per 
private admission. This implies that about half of the revenue loss from the Med-
icaid cutback was recovered through cost shifting. 
 As a result of the growth in managed care plans, hospital markets in the 
United States have become more competitive since the early 1980s. Consequently, 
to the extent that cost shifting existed in the past, it is likely to be decreasing since 
it is becoming much more difficult for hospitals to recoup losses from public payers 
by raising prices to private payers. The private payers face tough product markets 
of their own and are likely to resist upward price pressures from hospitals. However, 
to the extent that competition among hospitals and physicians is lacking in a 
market, it may be difficult to restrain health care cost growth or at least more dif-
ficult with multiple payers to do so than under a single-payer system. 
 Patient Selection 
 In a multiple-payer system, some insurers may earn higher profits by selecting 
favorable risks, leaving unhealthy risks to other insurers, including the government 
plans. Insurers covering relatively healthy persons may, at first glance, appear to 
be efficient, but this efficiency difference may be partially or even totally due to 
favorable patient selection. 
 There are differences between managed care and traditional insurance plans 
(plans relying on fee-for-service payment and not limiting insureds ’ choice of pro-
vider) in the illness severity of persons they cover. Managed care plans more fre-
quently enroll disproportionately higher numbers of young families and persons 
without long-standing ties to physicians, those with fewer chronic illnesses, and 
persons with lower rates of prior personal health care services utilization. Based 
on a review of several studies of patient selection by insurers,  Glied (2000 ) con-
cluded that managed care plans in the private sector tend to enjoy a 20 – 30 percent 
prior utilization advantage over traditional insurance plans. Differential patient 
selection by managed care and traditional plans can be a confounder in studies 
that estimate the effect of managed care plans on health care cost growth relative 
to that of traditional plans. While most studies have found that increased managed 
care activity is associated with a reduced growth rate in health care costs, some 
studies have concluded that managed care raises or has no overall effect on health 
care costs ( Glied 2000 ). This conflicting evidence may be partly a consequence of 
how the studies have accounted for temporal changes in the case mix of insured 

496 
 Part III / Chapter 11
persons in the two types of health plans. In sum, patient selection is another reason 
why multiple-payer systems may have limited potential in health care cost contain-
ment. It may be easier for insurers to compete on the basis of attracting low-cost 
individuals than by realizing actual efficiencies. 
 Spillover Effects 
 While cost shifting and favorable patient selection involve negative externalities, 
spillover effects involve a positive externality. An efficiency gain by one insurer 
may result in efficiency gains accruing to other insurers in the same market. 
Suppose that utilization monitoring by one insurer results in a reduced length of 
stay among patients hospitalized for heart attacks. This may change the practice 
patterns of physicians practicing in the area. The physicians begin by reducing the 
length of stay of patients covered by the one insurer that has become aggressive in 
utilization monitoring, but rather than reduce stays just for persons covered by this 
insurer, physicians change their practice for all of their heart attack patients, not 
just those covered by the one insurer. Here the action of one insurer has a much 
larger effect on patient care and health care cost than on expenditures incurred by 
the insurer that initiated the action. In this respect, a multiple-payer system has a 
favorable impact on health care cost containment. 
 In fact, several studies have reported that the growth of managed care plan 
enrollments is associated with reductions in hospital beds, reductions in the supply 
of physicians, mergers of providers, and reductions in technology adoption ( Baker 
and McClellan 2001 ). 
 There is empirical evidence of spillovers affecting the quality of care and 
physician prescribing patterns. There is evidence that the treatment of heart attacks 
tends to be better in areas with high managed care penetration, pointing to a spill-
over effect of higher-quality care to patients enrolled in the traditional insurance 
plans ( Baker and McClellan 2001 ). In addition, physicians tend to prescribe similar 
drugs to non-managed-care patients, although these patients are not restricted by 
the drug formulary imposed by the managed care plans. This aspect, too, is a posi-
tive attribute of a multiple-payer system in general and of managed care plans in 
particular. With the important caveat that the empirical evidence comes only from 
the United States, the evidence does suggest that countries with a multiple-payer 
system can realize higher quality and a higher rate of innovation than countries 
with a single-payer system.

 Summary and Conclusions 
 This chapter has described a typology to be used in this and the next two chapters. 
This chapter has focused on systems with substantial financing from private 
sources. No country, including the United States, has adopted a completely private 

Private Financing of Health Care Services 
 497
health care system of the type described in this chapter. Yet particularly in the 
United States, a major part of health expenditure is privately financed, and the vast 
majority of health care providers are private as well. For the elderly in the United 
States who are covered by social insurance, Medicare, the model more closely 
resembles social insurance with the private provision of services. This program is 
described in the next chapter, which focuses on social insurance and private 
provision. 
 For various reasons, managed care is now under attack from stakeholders, 
both physicians and members of the public alike. While we as economists typically 
honor private preferences, we need to be somewhat careful in this context since 
there are important distortions in the marketplace, especially in the United States, 
within the tax subsidy of private insurance purchases. Also, many of those who 
are most critical of managed care are health care providers who would presumably 
prefer not to negotiate over fees and other terms of work. The empirical evidence 
on managed care, overall, is much more favorable. 
 One way of structuring a health care system of the future is to build one based 
on managed competition. In an important sense, managed competition remains to 
be subjected to a true market test. To have a true market test, certain preconditions 
must be satisfied, including neutral tax and employer treatment of the alternatives 
among which consumers are to choose. Another precondition is transparency in 
prices, what is covered, as well as in the quality of the health care providers include 
in health plan ’ s network. These preconditions have proved to be very difficult to 
establish in the United States, although various building blocks are currently in 
place. 
 Having a multiple-payer system in which payers compete for business has 
both advantages, possibly in terms of quality and the rate of innovation, as well as 
disadvantages in terms of cost shifting and patient selection, sometimes termed 
 “ patient cream skimming. ” The choice of multiple- versus single-payer systems 
involves important trade-offs. Strong arguments can be made for either system. 
Competition in health care lacks an organized political constituency, which at least 
some forms of public regulation have. For example, health care providers often 
argue for entry regulation since they stand to benefit from it. Providers do not argue 
for managed competition since it promises low profit margins and exit for those 
who cannot meet the terms of a competitive marketplace. By contrast, citizen con-
sumers are not well organized. Efficient health care is only one of many issues that 
occupy their concerns. 
 The typology includes a category in which out-of-pocket payment by patients 
predominates. Out-of-pocket payment may rank high in terms of economic effi-
ciency, but it is poor in protecting households against health expenditure risk. 
Moreover, individual patients are poorly positioned to negotiate with providers 
over the price of care. Yet in many countries throughout the world, out-of-pocket 
payment is the main source of health care financing. We have summarized systems 

498 
 Part III / Chapter 11
in China and India; health systems in both countries, especially in China, are in 
transition, and economic growth may lead to major changes in these systems in 
these countries.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 11.1  Explain the distinction between patient-driven competition and payer-driven 
competition. Give examples of how these two types of competition would 
lead to different outcomes in a hospital market. 
 11.2  What are the elements of the managed competition model? What do you see 
as the advantages and disadvantages of the managed competition model? 
 11.3  Distinguish between the  “ cash system ” and the  “ private system ” described 
in this chapter. Which system provides better protection against health expen-
diture risk? Which system is in a better position to avoid a welfare loss arising 
from moral hazard? 
 Exercises 
 11.1  Use the concepts of cost of capital (COC) and marginal efficiency of 
investment (MEI) that you have learned in chapters 2 and 9 to analyze the 
effect of managed care on the diffusion of new and expensive medical technology 
in a hospital market. Present a graph to show how the growth of managed care 

Private Financing of Health Care Services 
 499
affects COC and MEI for hospital investment in new technology. Justify your 
answer. 
 11.2   Collect time-series data on the share of public financing and the share of 
public supply in your country or any other single country you prefer and plot these 
data in a figure that has a similar format as   figure 11.6 . Does the health care system 
in the country you selected remain stable over time or change from one system to 
another system? Explain the reason why the system remains constant or change 
over time. 
 11.3   In China, the share of national health expenditure paid through out-of-pocket 
payment increased from about 20 percent in 1980 to about 60 percent in 2000 (see 
 fig. 11.7 ). During the same period, real GDP per capita (in 2000 US dollars) increased 
from US$186 to US$949 (see World Bank Group 2007). Explain why the share of 
out-of-pocket payment increases as national income rises. Does this relationship 
imply that health insurance is an inferior good? Is it valid to generalize from the 
experience of China to predict the effect of economic growth in the share of out-
of-pocket payments in other countries, such as India? 
 11.4   The following is a summary statistics table for China and India in 2003.

ment Indicators (2009).  
 Using information from this table, why is the share of out-of-pocket payment higher 
in India than in China? If you were hired by the Indian government as a consultant, 
which policy options would you recommend to solve the problem of a high out-
of-pocket share in India? Is promoting economic growth on your list of policy 
options? Why or why not? 
 11.5   Recall the discussion in chapter 5 about a long-run decision involving prac-
tice location. Suppose that the World Trade Organization (WTO) signed a treaty 

500 
 Part III / Chapter 11
among all member countries guaranteeing no legal impediments to physician 
movement among countries. Physicians trained in one country could choose to 
practice location in any country in the world. Suppose you were a physician. 
Would the country ’ s health care system be an important consideration in your 
choice of country in which to practice? If your choice were limited to cash versus 
private systems, which system you prefer for your practice location, other things 
being equal? Explain the rationale for your choice.  
 11.6  Based on the time-series observations on China (see exercise 11.3 and   fig. 
11.7 ) and the cross-sectional comparisons between China and India (see question 
4), it seems difficult to draw a clear conclusion on the relationship between the 
share of out-of-pocket payments and national income. The share of out-of-pocket 
payment is positively associated with national income in time-series data, but 
this relationship is reversed in cross-sectional data. Can you develop a theory 
(or a story) to explain the relationship between the share of out-of-pocket 
payment and national income for most of the countries in the world? Based on 
your theory (or story), which relationship between share of out-of-pocket payment 
and national income (positive or negative) is the general case (i.e., applies to many 
other countries) and which relationship is a special case (i.e., applicable to a single 
country)?

 Government Financing and 
Private Supply 
 Many countries have single-payer government financing or private financing under 
strict government oversight, combined with the private provision of personal 
health care services. Health insurance in such situations is often provided as social 
insurance. This means that insurance coverage is universal and provided without 
regard to a person ’ s ability to pay. Benefits are provided uniformly to the entire 
covered population. If differences are allowed — for example, if supplementation 
with a private insurance plan is allowed — these differences are above a high 
minimum level of benefits. Taxation or premiums may be progressive or, more 
frequently, may be proportional to individuals ’ earnings, the latter in systems that 
obtain program revenue from a payroll tax. 
 The major underlying premise in most high-income countries is that coverage 
be universal. This can be achieved by the direct public provision of health insur-
ance or by laws requiring that individuals have health insurance coverage, which 
may be provided through groups, such as through employment, or as individual 
health insurance. 
 Nevertheless, even though the above broad principles are widely shared, 
there is much variation among countries in how the concept of social insurance is 
implemented. There are choices about how such insurance is to be financed. First, 
should special taxes be levied, and if so, which ones? Second, should the program 
be financed on a pay-as-you-go basis or should reserves for future (and uncertain) 
payments be maintained? If the latter, at what level should the reserves be main-
tained? How can the revenue system be structured so as to protect it from raids for 
use by other public programs? If the system is to be operated as a private mandate, 
how should the solvency of the private funds be ensured, and which specific 

504 
 Part III / Chapter 12
conditions should be imposed on the private plans (e.g., provisions regarding the 
insurability of persons with prior health conditions and the premiums such persons 
are expected to pay)? 
 On the expenditure side, first, how should payments be structured? What is 
the appropriate unit of payment, such as for hospitals, the patient day, stay, or fixed 
total budget? There is empirical evidence on this issue for some countries. Second, 
once the unit of payment is selected, how should the price per unit of service be 
determined? Third, should payment be payment in full, or is there a role for patient 
supplementation of fees, including co-payments and reference pricing for drugs? 
Governments in effect set separate prices for providers and patients. Fourth, which 
services should be covered (e.g., brand-name pharmaceuticals versus generics, 
medical devices such as implantable cardiac defibrillators)? And how should the 
process of making coverage decisions about new products and services be designed 
and implemented? Private health insurers must make similar decisions, but their 
decisions are private. When there is public financing, these matters become public 
choices. 
 12.1 
 The Role of Government as a Payer: Rationale 
for the Public Provision of Health Insurance 
 Universal Coverage, Social Insurance, and Means-Tested 
Insurance 
 A direct approach to achieving universal coverage is the direct public provision of 
health insurance. Payment can be public while health care providers are private 
entities as in the fully private system (see chapter 11). The rationale for universal 
coverage is that personal health services are a merit want. People are presumed to 
have the right to be able to use personal health care services regardless of their 
financial status. According to the merit want concept, personal health services are 
not to be allocated according to ability and willingness to pay as are the vast major-
ity of goods and services. Milk for young children and school lunches for elemen-
tary and secondary school children are other examples of merit wants. People 
regard it as only fair that children have access to these goods, not only if parents 
have the ability or willingness to pay. 
 Another justification for universal coverage is that it avoids adverse selection 
in health insurance patients. Under universal coverage, everyone is insured and 
under the same terms. Universal coverage is generally seen as equitable in that in 
systems without universal coverage, when services are provided to uninsured 
persons, the insured end up paying the bill. Advocates for the public provision of 
health insurance often argue that public insurers are more efficient than private 
insurers. Insurers that pick and choose among persons they want to insure incur 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 505
appreciable underwriting expense. Under universal coverage, enrollment is almost 
automatic. 
 When a government is the health insurer, it assumes the roles of (1) determin-
ing eligibility for coverage and actually enrolling individuals in the plan, (2) ensur-
ing the continued actuarial soundness of the program by collecting revenue sufficient 
to cover anticipated program outlays, (3) setting coverage and payment policies, (4) 
processing health insurance claims and actually paying health care providers for 
covered services rendered, and (5) serving as a health care regulator, monitoring 
fraud and abuse and increasingly monitoring the quality of care provided. 
 An alternative and often used social insurance model leaves much of the pro-
vision of health insurance in private hands. The role of the government is to specify 
the terms of the relationship between the insurer and the health care provider, as 
well as the terms of the  “ contract ”  between the insurer and the beneficiary, includ-
ing patient cost-sharing obligations, if any, the types of services covered, and the 
extent to which the beneficiary is free to choose his or her own health care provider, 
as well as the insurer ’ s allowable underwriting and premium-setting practices. 
 Underwriting refers to practices of insurers related to the types of risks the insurer 
covers (e.g., whether or not persons with certain preexisting conditions are covered). 
Under this model, perhaps only the regulatory role is housed in the government. 
The remaining functions are the responsibility of private organizational entities. 
 Another alternative to social insurance is government-supplied means-tested 
insurance. Under the latter, only a subset of persons is eligible for public coverage. 
Means testing employs income and asset tests for program eligibility. Persons with 
income or assets above a maximum threshold are no longer eligible. In some cases, 
rather than employ a fixed income or income-plus-assets threshold as the criterion 
for eligibility, persons may earn a higher income than the threshold, but the income 
is partly or entirely confiscated by requiring that income above the threshold be 
used to defray the government ’ s cost of providing the service to the individual. An 
example of a means-tested health insurance program is the US Medicaid program 
(see chapter 5). 
 The underlying rationale for social insurance is that access to the covered 
goods and services is a right of all individuals. With means-tested insurance, such 
access is a right to individuals with especially low ability to pay for such goods 
and services. Since means-tested programs apply only to a fraction of the popula-
tion, some of the efficiencies in administration that accrue under social insurance 
are lost. Further, means-tested programs lack the purchasing power of single public 
insurers. 
 Arguments of Advocates for the Public Provision of Health 
Insurance 
 Advocates for the public provision of insurance or the alternative, in which there 
is private insurance but under the strict supervision of public law, make the 

506 
 Part III / Chapter 12
following arguments. First and foremost, they argue that public provision is needed 
to ensure universal health insurance coverage. Under a private health insurance 
system not subject to strict public scrutiny, it is almost inevitable that some persons 
will remain uncovered by health insurance plans even if universal coverage is the 
public goal. The essential feature of a private system is choice, including the choice 
not to purchase the good or service. Under a private system, even if personal health 
insurance is viewed as a merit want, the main policy instrument to achieve high 
levels of coverage is the  “ carrot ”  of financial incentives, generally tax incentives 
that accrue to persons who purchase health insurance. Under a public system, 
people are compelled to be insured. 
 There is another argument for the direct public provision of health insurance 
or for statutes compelling individuals to be insured. Many people may not be suf-
ficiently forward-looking or may be forward-looking but discount costs in future 
periods substantially so that the cost of possible of future out-of-pocket health 
care expenditures receives little weight in current consumption decisions. If so, 
such persons may need a government ’ s help so that they act in their long-run 
self-interest. 
 Compulsion offers two related advantages. By compelling healthy people to 
enroll in insurance plans and pay premiums or taxes, there is a cross subsidy from 
healthy to sick individuals. Without the participation of the healthy individuals, 
who may be tempted to eschew coverage under a voluntary system, this type of 
cross subsidy would not occur. Also, some of the healthy individuals will eventu-
ally become sick. When sick and lacking health insurance, these healthy-turned-
sick individuals may not be willing or able to pay for the care they receive. When 
people are sick, it goes against social norms to refuse to care for them simply 
because they do not pay. Thus, since these individuals consume scarce resources 
when they are sick, these costs must be covered by someone. It is often argued that 
those with health insurance end up paying the bill. In the jargon of the health field, 
hospitals in particular  “ cost shift ” shortfalls from their nonpaying customers to the 
bills of those who pay — those patients with health insurance (see chapter 11).  1 
 Third, in some respects, the public model is more efficient than the private 
one. Private insurers need to market their products and incur costs in enrolling 
people in their plans. Under the public model, it is likely to be necessary to prove 
one ’ s personal identity, but there is no need for marketing, and enrollment is almost 
automatic. Since the benefit structure and the fees are the same for all covered 
individuals, as are the terms of coverage, health care providers in a country with 
a public health insurance system do not need to check the patient ’ s eligibility, 
whether or not the patient ’ s plan covers a particular service, which may vary 
according to the patient ’ s specific health condition, and how much the insurance 
plan pays for a particular service. For all of these reasons, it is argued that public 
insurance is less costly administratively both to insurers and to health care pro-
viders, who do not need to investigate the terms of a patient ’ s coverage on a 
1.  See chapter 11 for a 
discussion of some of 
the empirical evidence 
on cost shifting. To the 
extent that the hospital 
market in the United 
States has become more 
competitive in recent 
years, there should be a 
reduction in hospitals ’ 
ability to cost shift.

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 507
patient-specific basis. A patient merely shows his or her health insurance card, 
and this is the only checking that the provider has to do. 
 Fourth, given the purchasing power and other powers of government, a public 
insurer can obtain services at lower prices than a private insurer can. Greater bar-
gaining power accrues to the benefit of the public, if not to the collective benefit 
of health care providers, who may prefer a private health insurance system for this 
reason. 
 Fifth, government may be more efficient in providing regulatory oversight of 
a public than a private entity. For example, for purposes of evaluating insurer 
solvency risk, access to accounting records may be more easily obtained by regula-
tors from public enterprises. In any case, the regulation of private health insurers 
in particular and of health care costs in general may be more effective when gov-
ernment controls the health insurance apparatus. 
 Although these five alleged advantages of the public provision of health 
insurance are supported by a large community of health policy experts, government 
officials, and politicians, there are counterarguments as well. 
 First, it is one thing to require that all individuals have health insurance but 
quite another to ascertain that all individuals actually comply with this statutory 
requirement. Physicians are unlikely to want to be in the position of verifying the 
insurance status of their patients as long as they are paid. In the United States, 
physician reporting of patients who lack health insurance may violate privacy laws. 
 This is less of an issue when the government provides insurance coverage 
directly rather than when the government compels individuals to obtain specific 
types of coverage from any source. As long as the statute requiring coverage is not 
enforced, universal coverage is not likely to be achieved. A related problem is what 
to do about a violation of the compulsory insurance law in cases in which a viola-
tion is detected. Would a fine be levied? How would this work if at the same time 
the violator is critically ill or dead? 
 Mandatory cross subsidies do not necessarily enhance social welfare. The 
argument for cross subsidies relies on an equity argument that the healthy have an 
obligation to subsidize the sick. Cross subsidies are inefficient to the extent that 
they require some individuals to forgo more consumption of other goods and ser-
vices than they would absent compulsion. In other words, for some individuals, 
the amount paid for health insurance exceeds their marginal valuation of the 
benefit of coverage, in particular risk-neutral persons and risk lovers, and those 
with  “ good ”  genes. The compulsion aspect involves a trade-off between the loss 
in individual welfare and the social gains from having what is judged to be a fairer 
distribution of societal resources. Although government compulsion may offset bad 
personal decisions made by myopic individuals, the downside is that forward-
looking and rational individuals are likely to be made worse off by compulsion. 
 There is no dispute that public health insurers incur fewer costs in enrolling 
persons in their programs; there are savings in the cost of marketing their plans to 

508 
 Part III / Chapter 12
potential consumers. Savings accrue to health care providers from being able to 
bill a single insurer rather than multiple insurers. However, multiple insurers with 
varying characteristics may provide a better match with consumers that have het-
erogeneous preferences. When Henry Ford marketed the first Model T Ford, which 
was painted a black color, some individual wants were likely to have been satisfied. 
But it is likely that some consumers preferred a car in a color other than black. (All 
Model T ’ s were painted black.) Advocates for single public health insurers implic-
itly argue that the benefits of heterogeneity are more than offset by the savings in 
overhead expense of having multiple insurers with varying attributes competing 
for health insurance business. 
 Granting a single insurer or government agency the exclusive right to negotiate 
fees and other conditions with providers may indeed give them monopsony power 
in purchasing health care services. The exercise of monopsony power may lead to 
(1) too little quantity of the service being produced, (2) reductions in the quality of 
care, and (3) because of lower prices, less incentive for innovation (i.e., monopsony 
power may lead to dynamic inefficiency; see chapter 9). Undoubtedly, suppliers of 
health care goods and services are made worse off, but even though monopsony 
power may relieve pressure on public budgets and achieve cost containment, it is 
not self-evident that the public at large is better off with monopsony. 
 Finally, the public provision of health insurance plausibly facilitates the regu-
lation of health services. Such regulation includes entry regulation — that is, the 
regulation of entry of hospitals and other health care facilities — and regulation of 
prices and hospital budgets. However, whether or not such regulation serves the 
public interest and whether or not the results are superior to those seen with private 
health insurance that relies on competition to achieve socially desirable outcomes 
are unresolved issues. 
 Choices in the Design of Public Payment Systems 
 Health care includes a complex array of services, including physician visits, inpa-
tient admissions, prescription drugs, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, 
including surgical procedures. As medical technology has changed over time, many 
new drugs, devices, and treatment procedures have emerged, expanding the fea-
sible set of health services. Given limited resources, policy makers in any health 
insurance system, public or private, face a choice of what kind of services the 
health insurance program should cover. In private systems, a decision facing the 
public sector is the benefit structure of private plans that qualify for favorable tax 
treatment; or when there is policy form regulation, as in some US states, there is 
government oversight of the content of private insurance policies and how provi-
sions of companies ’ offerings are presented to potential customers. Here we focus 
on public insurance, drawing on insights from economic analysis. 
 At least five criteria have been proposed in the literature for designing a 
public health insurance program, which indirectly answers the question of what 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 509
services health insurance should cover (  table 12.1 ). The first criterion is to mini-
mize the efficiency loss resulting from the implementation of health insurance. The 
introduction of health insurance results in a  “ moral hazard ” problem in the sense 
that individuals increase consumption of health care as health insurance reduces 
the money price of health care at the point at which services are received (see 
chapter 3). The moral hazard problem in turn leads to a welfare loss because the 
social cost of increased consumption in health care exceeds the corresponding 
social benefit. The magnitude of welfare loss resulting from moral hazard depends 
on the price elasticity of demand for personal health care services (see chapter 3, 
fig. 3.5b). A higher price elasticity, that is, a higher responsiveness of health care 
demand to price change, leads to a larger welfare loss. This suggests that health 
services with relatively low price elasticities should be given higher priority as 
candidates for inclusion in the public health program than health services with 
higher price elasticities.  
 The price elasticity of inpatient care is smaller than is the price elasticity of 
outpatient care ( Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group 1993 ). Thus, 
almost all health insurance programs provide coverage for hospital care because of 
its lower price elasticity. In contrast, some insurance programs may exclude cover-
age of outpatient services because the utilization of such services is often more 
responsive to price changes. Similarly, such personal health services as dental care 
and physical examinations have higher price elasticities. For this reason, many 
public insurance programs also exclude coverage for dental care and well care. 
Excluding preventive care may be foolish in the long run to the extent that insured 
persons may demand more care later when they become sick from conditions that 
might have been prevented with some preventive care earlier (see  Ellis and Manning 
2007  and  Newhouse and Sinaiko 2008 ).

510 
 Part III / Chapter 12
 If inpatient care and outpatient care are substitutes rather than complements, 
then providing insurance coverage for inpatient care only encourages the consumer 
to use inpatient care as a substitute for outpatient care. Consequently, the welfare 
loss may be higher than that incurred by providing health insurance coverage for 
both inpatient and outpatient care. The empirical findings obtained by the RAND 
Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) do not support this concern. Rather, the HIE 
found that hospital inpatient and outpatient care are complements. The group with 
the high deductible plan in the HIE did not increase its utilization of inpatient care 
compared to the group with the free care plan (see chapter 3). Recall that the 
deductible applied only to outpatient care. 
 A second criterion for determining the scope of a public payment system 
focuses on maximizing the benefit of risk protection. The value of health insurance 
reflects the welfare gain from reduced risk bearing (see chapter 4). The benefit of 
risk protection through health insurance depends on the variance of loss and the 
size of the loss when people become sick. Events with a probability of loss near 1, 
such as a common cold and obtaining a regular physical examination, or near 0, 
such as getting tuberculosis in high-income countries, have a low variance. Deci-
sion makers should therefore give lower priority to including such events in the 
health insurance program. By contrast, this criterion suggests that high-cost health 
services should be given higher priority as candidates for inclusion in a public 
health program than low-cost health services. Compared to physician visits in an 
outpatient setting, hospital care is relatively more expensive. This helps to explain 
why almost all public health insurance programs globally provide more compre-
hensive insurance coverage for inpatient hospital care than for outpatient care. 
 The criterion of maximizing the benefit of risk protection can also explain 
why the scope of coverage of public health insurance plans has changed over time. 
For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, few health insurance programs, either public 
or private, provided coverage for prescription drugs because expenditures on pre-
scription drugs accounted for only a small share of health costs at that time ( Berndt 
2002 ). With population aging and advances in pharmaceutical technology, spend-
ing on prescription drugs for chronic diseases has increased. As a result, more and 
more health insurance programs began to provide coverage for such expenses. For 
example, in the United States, Medicare began to provide insurance coverage for 
prescription drugs in 2006. 
 The third criterion relates to budgetary impacts on the public insurance 
program. Holding other factors constant, governments will be more resistant to 
covering new products or services that have relatively expensive budgetary impacts. 
 With advances in medical technology, many new diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures and drugs have been introduced. The new technologies in turn affect 
the cost of health care through two channels: a treatment substitution effect and a 
treatment expansion effect ( Cutler, McClellan, and Newhouse 2000 ). A  treatment 
substitution effect  describes the substitution of new treatments for older ones for 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 511
treating established patients. This effect may result in an increased or decreased 
cost of health care, depending on whether the new therapies are cost-saving or 
cost-increasing. The  treatment expansion effect  refers to the phenomenon of more 
people being treated for disease when new drugs or treatment procedures are 
introduced. Hence, the treatment expansion effect  always  leads to increased health 
care expenditures. In most cases, the treatment expansion effect dominates the 
treatment substitution effect ( Glied 2000 ). This suggests that a predictable conse-
quence of adopting new technology is an increase in health care costs. As a result, 
many policy makers in public insurance program use the budgetary impact of 
adopting a new technology as a criterion for deciding whether or not a new tech-
nology should be covered by health insurance. Under this criterion, new technol-
ogy that would potentially consume a major share of a country ’ s health care budget 
is less likely to be included in the public insurance program. 
 The fourth criterion is to maximize the net health benefits of health care 
resources. Although new technologies are costly to society, they often yield major 
health benefits. Thus, focusing on the budget impact only may not allocate scare 
resources efficiently. Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-benefit analysis provide 
guidance for optimal resource allocation (see chapters 14 and 15). Under the 
optimal resource allocation criterion, the decision about which new technologies 
should be covered by public health insurance is made by evaluating new products 
and services according to their benefits relative to their costs. This criterion sug-
gests that public health insurance should cover all products or services whose 
benefit is greater than or equal to their cost, a benefit-cost criterion; or, using cost-
effectiveness analysis, products and services are ranked in inverse order to their 
cost-effectiveness ratios, and a larger or smaller number of items are covered as a 
function of the size of health budget ( Hoel 2007 ). 
 Since Australia led the way in 1992, several countries have adopted such 
approaches for deciding whether their public insurance programs should provide 
coverage for a new technology, especially new prescription drugs ( Drummond 
2007 ). 
 The fifth criterion is to maximize social welfare. This criterion differs from 
the above criterion that maximizes health benefits if there exists an opportunity 
for consumers to access a private market. If so, consumers either pay out of pocket 
or use private health insurance to finance care not covered by public insurance. 
 Hoel (2007 ) argues that the criterion of maximizing health benefits explicitly or 
implicitly assumes there is no private market for services not covered by the public 
insurance program. In other words, these services would not be offered at all if 
they were not covered by the public insurance program. An example of this type 
of service is biologics, which are costly and have small market sizes because of the 
specialized nature of these therapies. 
 Treatments using specific biologics may not be available in a country when 
the public insurance program does not provide coverage for these products. This 

512 
 Part III / Chapter 12
is because the fixed costs of these products, including the costs of marketing and 
educating physicians about the products and their use, may be high relative to the 
small population served. Hence, introducing such products in a country may be 
unprofitable to sellers of these products. In such a case, the value of health insur-
ance would include not only the gain of risk protection but also the gain of access 
to health care that would otherwise be unavailable or unaffordable — a value 
derived from the value of health care that insurance makes accessible ( Nyman 
1999 ). 
 However, in most cases, there is an option of paying out of pocket if a par-
ticular treatment is not covered by public insurance. When the option of paying 
for treatment out of pocket is available, the criterion of maximizing health benefits 
is not necessarily the best one for health care budget allocation ( Hoel 2007 ). This 
is because the availability of other choices (paying out of pocket) alters the value 
of public health insurance. On the one hand, the health benefit of public health 
insurance cannot be measured by total health gains of treatment. Rather, it can only 
be measured by the marginal health gain of treatment because individuals can 
obtain treatment in the private sector if the coverage in the public sector is not 
available. On the other hand, public health insurance does not create added value 
because the treatment is already available through another payment option. In this 
case, public health insurance only offers the public the benefit of risk protection. 
 Given the availability of financing care out of pocket,  Hoel (2007 ) suggests 
that an efficiency criterion be used for deciding which types of care should be 
covered by the public health insurance, namely, to maximize social welfare — the 
sum of the individual utilities of persons through being covered by the public 
health insurance program. Based on this criterion, he offers the following three 
propositions as a guide to decision making. First, given the same ratio of health 
benefits to costs, services with no private market should be assigned a higher prior-
ity for inclusion in the public health insurance program than services with private 
markets. This proposition suggests that policy makers can increase the value of 
public health insurance through offering improved access to services that would 
have been unavailable otherwise. 
 Second, even if a private market for a treatment (or diagnostic procedure) is 
available, some patients may choose to be untreated (or undiagnosed) if the treat-
ment (diagnostic procedure) is not covered by public health insurance. In this case, 
private care is available, but some individuals judge it to be  “ unaffordable. ”  Based 
on the criterion of maximizing social welfare, services with greater health benefits 
should be given higher priority for inclusion in the public health insurance program, 
so long as the costs of the various treatments are the same. This indicates that 
public health insurance can increase its value by making care with substantial 
health benefits affordable — care that, absent government intervention, would often 
be unaffordable. 
 Third, a priority for public insurance coverage should be given to those ser-
vices with higher costs among various services that have the same benefit-to-cost 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 513
ratios. This proposition also highlights the fact that public insurance can increase 
social welfare by making unaffordable health care more accessible. 
 In sum, diverse criteria exist for making decisions about the scope of public 
coverage, and the choices depend on the relative weights assigned to each criterion. 
For example, if the value of public health insurance is limited to expenditure risk 
protection, then the criterion of minimizing the efficiency loss (moral hazard) 
yields the same conclusion as the criterion of maximizing the benefits of risk pro-
tection. Both criteria suggest that hospital care should be given a higher priority 
for inclusion in public coverage than outpatient care. By contrast, the criterion of 
maximizing social welfare expands the value of public health insurance by con-
sidering the possibility of private care. Hence, this criterion yields a different 
ranking of public coverage priorities than does a criterion solely based on the 
results of cost-effectiveness analysis. 
 The next sections provide country case studies of publicly supplied insurance 
with private provision of personal health services. These case studies are interest-
ing in their own right, but they also suggest approaches that might be adopted by 
low- and middle-income countries that currently lack universal health insurance 
coverage.

system has a monopoly. In others, such as China, the system has a monopoly, but 
a large share of national health expenditures is financed by out-of-pocket payments 
for care. In still a third category are the US public insurance programs, which 
coexist with private health insurance plans. We shall return to a discussion of the 
issues just described after we present the country case studies. In reality, no country 
actually uses the above criteria in making choices about its health care system. 
Rather, the criteria provide a useful guide for evaluating health system 
performance.  
 12.2 
 Evolution and Structure of the Payment 
System: German Statutory Health Insurance 
 The German experience provides an excellent case study for two reasons. First, the 
country has an unusually long history of health insurance provision. The system 
was established in 1888 as the country was industrializing, and socialism repre-
sented a threat to the government in power and to industrial interests. Second, the 
German model has been adopted by several other high-income countries, such as 
Japan and other East Asian countries. Unlike in many other countries, such as 
Canada, the federal government Germany has no role in financing health services. 
However, in Germany, there is a federal mandate requiring employers to provide 
health insurance to their employees, and certain important health policies, such 
as those related to the pricing of pharmaceuticals, are federal ( Swami 2002 ). 
 The German health insurance system is largely employment-based. Most care 
is delivered by self-employed, office-based physicians in the ambulatory sector and 
by salaried physicians in the hospital sector. The vast majority of institutions in 
the hospital sector are public or church-affiliated not-for profit organizations. 
 Individuals with monthly earnings below a fixed money threshold, set to 
apply to about 90 percent of the population, must be covered by statutory health 
insurance (SHI). Persons with earnings above this threshold may opt out of SHI 
but must then enroll in a private health insurance plan. The remainder, about two 
percent of the population, consists of government civil servants who are enrolled 
in their own plan — most of the two percent, with a very small proportion of popu-
lation covered by a means-tested health insurance program,  Sozialhilfe , similar to 
Medicaid in the United States. In 2002, 57 percent of funding for health care came 
through the SHI system in the form of employer and employee contributions, 
assessed as a percentage of the employee ’ s pay ( Altenstetter and Busse 2005 , 124), 
and 8 percent came from private health insurance premiums. Only 8 percent of 
funding came from general tax revenue. 
 Health insurers under SHI are sickness funds ( gesetzliche Krankenkassen ). 
These are private nonprofit organizations that qualify as health insurers under the 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 515
federal statute. The largest single sickness fund is a geographically based fund with 
membership determined by where the individual lives. Other sickness funds are 
specific to the company at which a person is employed or to an occupation, such 
as farming, maritime occupations, mining, and white-collar work. Employer and 
employee contributions are proportional to the employee ’ s earnings. Thus, more 
highly paid employees (and their employers) pay more. However, sickness funds 
are not allowed to base contributions on employee age, gender, marital status, 
numbers of dependents, or the individual ’ s health status. Private health insurance 
plans may base their premiums on such factors, but even the most highly paid 
employee has access to SHI. 
 Historically, an individual employee had no choice of sickness fund. If the 
factory, for example, had a sickness fund, the employee enrolled in this fund ( W ö rz 
and Busse 2005 ). However, in recent years, individuals have had a choice of sick-
ness fund. We describe this development more fully below. 
 Throughout most of its 120-year history, the basic ground rules for health 
insurance have been established by the central government, but much decision 
making is vested in  private organizations at the state ( Land ) level. These private 
organizations are subject to strict legal requirements. Much policy is the result of 
negotiations between associations of sickness funds, consisting of the various types 
of sickness funds, and associations of sickness fund health care providers, hospi-
tals, and physicians. Claims management, processing bills, and paying providers 
are tasks performed by associations of providers in each state. Exceptions to this 
pattern occurred during the period in which the National Socialists were in power 
(1933 – 1945) and in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany, 1949 – 1989), 
when health care providers in all or part of what is Germany today were employed 
by the state. 
 Physicians and hospitals are private entities in Germany. However, their fees 
are set through bilateral negotiations between the association of sickness funds and 
the association of providers at the state level. Individual providers are price takers. 
When SHI insureds show their  Versichertenkarten , credit card – like insurance 
cards, they are entitled to unlimited ambulatory and hospital care ( Schulenburg 
1994 ). Since the prices and conditions of payment do not vary by sickness fund, 
the only relevant factor to the physician is whether or not the patient presents a 
card. Privately insured patients may pay higher prices than do those insured 
through SHI sickness funds, but the vast majority of patients are enrolled in SHI. 
 Much German health policy attention during the latter part of the twentieth 
century was devoted to health care cost containment. Nearly complete health insur-
ance coverage has been a factor in expenditure growth. Further, although the 
system placed reliance on bilateral negotiations between associations of sickness 
funds and providers, such reliance may have been misplaced. Associations of 
providers may be expected to promote the interests of their members, even when, 
as under SHI, membership is compulsory. Since higher expenditures translate into 

516 
 Part III / Chapter 12
higher provider incomes, these associations cannot be expected to promote cost 
containment. The parties on the other side of the table, the associations of sickness 
funds, did not have a real incentive to promote cost containment because its con-
sumer base was assured (see  Zweifel and Breyer 1997 , 257 – 264, for a discussion 
of professional associations in health care). 
 Higher costs translated into higher payroll contribution rates. Dissatisfied 
consumers did not have an exit option but rather were compelled to pay the higher 
rates. The fact that health care providers were and continue to be able to negotiate 
collectively, which is not allowed in countries such as the United States, has had 
the effect of offsetting the monopsony power of insurers if insurers choose to exer-
cise it. 
 In 1996, Germany began to allow individuals free choice of sickness fund 
under its SHI system. An objective of the change was to increase efficiency by 
improving competition discipline on insurers. This approach can succeed only if 
people are willing to switch insurers in return for a lower premium.  Tamm, Tauch-
mann, Wasem, et al. (2007) examined the repercussions of differences in required 
contribution percentages (payroll contribution percentages as imposed by the 
insurer) on individual choice of statutory health plan. The short-run price elastici-
ties in a sickness fund they obtained were lower than in previous studies, including 
those conducted with data from other countries, but they found substantial long-
run price elasticities, implying that the price of insurance had important effects on 
individuals ’  choice of statutory health plan. In recent years, especially since reuni-
fication of the two parts of Germany, health care reform has been a persistent public 
policy issue ( Pfaff and Kern 2005 ;  Carrera, Siemens, and Bridges 2008 ). The major 
impetus for the reform initiatives has been the rise in the fraction of gross domestic 
product devoted to personal health care services. Because the statutory health 
insurance is financed through a payroll tax, increases in the contribution percent-
ages of employees and employers are transparent to all. The increase in the share 
of GDP devoted to health care reflects both growth in such expenditures and a 
sluggish growth of the German economy. Even with twelve major health care 
reforms between 1992 and 2007, what is perceived as a problem of a rising health 
care share remains. 
 12.3 
 Evolution and Structure of the Payment 
System: The US Medicare Program 
 Background 
 Because of the United States ’ population size and high levels of expenditure on 
personal health care services per capita population, viewed in absolute terms, both 
private and public health care financing are sizable in the United States. As 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 517
 Reinhardt (2005 , 83) has noted,  “ The U.S. health system arguably represents the 
most complex intersection between the private and public sector to be found any-
where in the world. ” Reinhardt attributed reliance on public and private systems 
in the United States to two mutually contradictory strands in US culture and poli-
tics. On the one hand, there is a widespread belief in the United States that the 
private sector is inherently more efficient than the public sector can ever be. On 
the other, government seems to be the sector that the US public ultimately trusts, 
especially when confronted with disasters, such as hurricanes or terrorist attacks. 
 An alternative interpretation is that the US public has an unmistakable prefer-
ence for private provision but recognizes that governments can accomplish some 
objectives that the private sector cannot. For example, achieving society ’ s distribu-
tional objectives is likely to require government intervention. The altruism of 
private individuals only goes so far. Furthermore, there are limits to the extent to 
which private organizations can diversify away risk. In the United States, public 
financing is principally done for the elderly and work-disabled through the Medi-
care program (  table 12.3 ). 
 Medicare is a social insurance program with eligibility determined on the 
basis of age (for persons aged 65 and older) and disability status (for persons 
younger than age 65 with major disabilities). Since the early 1970s, persons with 
end-stage renal disease have also been covered by Medicare. 
 For most of the program ’ s history, premium assessments have been indepen-
dent of a person ’ s income. By contrast, Medicaid has strict income and

asset eligibility standards. In this sense, given means-tested eligibility standards, 
Medicaid, though publicly financed, should not be considered a social insurance 
program. In 2005, nearly 14 percent of Americans were covered by Medicare (US 
Census Bureau 2011) and 13 percent were covered by Medicaid (US Census Bureau 
2011). Although Medicare and Medicaid, taken together, cover only about one-
quarter of the US population, these two public programs account for nearly 40 
percent of total health care expenditure in the United States (  table 12.3 ). Some 
Medicare beneficiaries have Medicaid coverage for the part of personal health care 
expenditure that Medicare does not cover.  
 Medicare and Medicaid were implemented in the mid-1960s. When initially 
implemented, Medicare primarily covered hospital and physician expenses, and it 
provided generous reimbursement to both hospitals and physicians.  Finkelstein 
(2007)  has estimated that in 1963, only 25 percent of the elderly in the United 
States had meaningful coverage. After implementation, the coverage of persons 
aged 65 and older in the United States rose to virtually 100 percent. If, counterfac-
tually, Medicare had not been implemented, it is highly likely that the percentage 
of elderly persons in the United States with insurance coverage would have been 
much higher than 25 percent 40 – 50 years hence. However, it seems likely that the 
percentage would have been far less than universal. And the increase in the share 
of the elderly population covered would have been far less than it was in the latter 
decades of the twentieth century. Extending coverage is only one indicator, however. 
As discussed below, the implementation of Medicare had several other important 
effects as well. 
 Using a body count to compute the percentage of elderly persons with health 
insurance coverage is misleading in one important sense. Only slightly more than 
half of payments for personal health care services made on behalf of Medicare 
beneficiaries come from Medicare ( Reinhardt 2005 , 89). The other half consists of 
payments from Medicaid (for those beneficiaries with dual Medicare and Medicaid 
coverage), private ( “ Medigap ” ) insurance, out-of-pocket payments by Medicare 
beneficiaries, and other programs such as the Veterans Administration. The vast 
majority of Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental coverage of some type. 
 Why would Medicare cover such a small percentage of expenditures on per-
sonal health care services? The answer is complex. At the risk of oversimplifica-
tion, a major reason reflects the way that the Medicare program is financed. 
Medicare has several parts, of which the two largest and oldest are Part A and Part 
B. Part A, which mainly covers hospital care, is financed by a payroll tax, with 
equal percentages from employer and employee as its revenue source, as in the 
German system. A payroll tax dedicated to a single use is highly transparent to 
taxpayers. This is in contrast to employer-provided health benefits as in the United 
States, the major cost of which is only irregularly and voluntarily reported to 
employees. Part B is financed by a combination of general tax revenue, including 
the federal personal income and corporate income taxes, and beneficiary-paid 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 519
premiums. In recent years the premiums have become means tested, that is, depen-
dent on the beneficiary ’ s income. The existence of supplementary coverage pro-
vides a safety valve that lessens the pressure on politicians to raise Medicare 
benefits and provider reimbursement. 
 The two major forms of supplementary insurance are quite different and must 
be considered separately. Medigap policies serve two functions. First, they cover 
expenses associated with covered inpatient and outpatient benefits that are unpaid 
by Medicare. For example, as explained more fully below, Medicare currently pays 
physicians based on a Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS). Most of the 
payment to hospitals by Medicare is on a prospective basis through the Medicare 
prospective payment system (PPS). A fixed price is paid according to the diagnosis-
related group (DRG), which characterizes the diagnosis or principal procedure that 
the beneficiary received while in the hospital. Physicians who accept Medicare 
payment can bill up to 15 percent above this fee schedule. Medigap can pay this 
15 percent. In addition, Medicare imposes deductibles and coinsurance. Medigap 
policies can pay the cost-sharing obligations for hospital and physicians ’ services. 
While Medigap coverage provides Medicare beneficiaries with additional out-of-
pocket health expenditure risk protection, the downside is that it increases moral 
hazard. Second, Medigap policies provide some coverage for services not included 
in the Medicare benefit package, such as lengthy nursing home stays. 
 Since the mid-1980s, Medicare has permitted beneficiaries to opt out of the 
government-run Medicare program to join a Medicare-qualified HMO (Medicare 
Part C). The HMO must provide a benefit package that is at least as generous as 
that offered by Medicare. In exchange, the HMO is paid a fixed capitation payment 
plus, depending on the plan ’ s benefits, a direct payment from the beneficiary. 
 In 2006, Medicare introduced prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D). 
Previously, drugs were not covered by Medicare, but drugs were covered by 
Medigap plans and by Medicaid. 
 Hospital Payment under Medicare: The Medicare Prospective 
Payment System 
 Although the public is mainly concerned about the benefit structure of its insur-
ance plans and is generally unaware of how the plan pays providers for services 
covered by the plan, payment methods have a major influence on the cost of, access 
to, and quality of services. At the time Medicare was initially designed and imple-
mented, comparatively little discussion was devoted to how providers, mainly 
hospitals and physicians, would be paid. The decision was made to adopt the 
payment system used by many Blue Cross plans at the time. Blue Cross plans are 
private insurance plans, at the time all private, not-for-profit organizations. Blue 
Cross paid hospitals on a retrospective cost-based reimbursement basis. In a retro-
spective cost-based reimbursement system, hospitals are paid for costs incurred in 
caring for persons covered by the plan after the costs are incurred. 

520 
 Part III / Chapter 12
 Hospital incentives were substantially altered when in 1983, Medicare began 
to transition to a PPS. Medicare PPS has had an enormous influence on hospitals 
in the United States; on methods of payment used by other US programs, such as 
Medicaid; and in other countries, including Australia, Germany, and South Korea. 
A diagnosis-related group is a grouping based on diagnoses and procedures pro-
vided that is associated with a payment weight. Initially, the payment weights were 
derived from hospital prices on bills submitted to Medicare reduced by the ratio 
of hospital revenue to cost. Thus, for example, if the mean revenue per case for a 
particular DRG was $10,000 and the revenue-to-cost ratio was 1.2, then the $10,000 
price was reduced to $8,333. The weights are recalculated annually as the ratio of 
the mean charges reported by hospitals to Medicare within the DRG to the mean 
reported charges for all admissions, adjusted for various geographic and hospital-
specific factors ( McClellan 1997 , 96). 
 A general problem with regulation of prices is that the regulator does not 
know the regulated firm ’ s cost function. A PPS-type program offers a remarkable 
approach for cost finding. The government announces to regulated firms, in this 
context hospitals, that it will pay the firms an amount adequate to cover the unit 
cost incurred by an efficient firm. Each firm reasons that other firms will reduce 
cost to the efficient level and that if it does not do the same, it will receive a 
payment that does not cover its cost. Thus, reasoning that other firms will do the 
same, each hospital cuts its costs and becomes efficient. In this way, the regulator 
discovers the efficient level of cost. This process of cost finding is called  “ yardstick 
competition ” ( Shleifer 1985 ). 
 Paying a fixed amount per admission provides a number of incentives to 
hospitals. First, PPS replaced a system in which hospitals were paid on a retrospec-
tive cost basis. Under retrospective cost reimbursement, a dollar increase in allow-
able (by the insurer) cost leads to a dollar increase in revenue. By contrast, under 
prospective payment per admission, payment does not increase with increases in 
hospital costliness. Thus, hospitals have a direct incentive to be efficient. Under 
retrospective cost reimbursement, a dollar saved by the hospital translates into a 
dollar of revenue lost. Under PPS, when a hospital incurs a dollar less per case, 
this dollar accrues to the hospital as increased profit. 
 Second, PPS gives hospitals an incentive to reduce patient length of stay since 
payment does not increase when duration of stay is lengthened. Similarly, there is 
an incentive to perform procedures before and after the hospital stay since proce-
dures not performed during a stay are not included in the prospectively determined 
price paid for the hospital inpatient stay. 
 The PPS has potential adverse side effects as well. For example, hospitals 
have an incentive to upcode diagnoses since this may cause the patient to be clas-
sified into a higher-priced DRG ( Silverman and Skinner 2004 ). And while from 
one perspective, saving on diagnostic and therapeutic procedures is a favorable 
development, from another, there may be adverse effects on beneficiary health.

 Box 12.1 
 Specific Incentives to Hospitals under the Prospective Payment System 
 The Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) provides several important incen-
tives to hospitals. The basic structure of the PPS is described in the text. This box 
describes two studies that investigated specific features of the PPS. 
 Dafny (2005) explains that  average payment incentives remain under the PPS, 
although the implementation of the PPS regime has eliminated  marginal reimburse-
ment incentives for services rendered. (More care for inpatients with a given diagnosis 
does not normally result in higher levels of payment from Medicare to the hospital.) 
Average payment matters because the fixed amount of payment that hospitals 
receive per hospitalized patients under the PPS varies among the approximately 500 
diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). For various reasons, hospitals earn more  “ profit ” 
(fixed payment received from Medicare program minus cost incurred by the hospital) 
from treating patients in some DRGs than from treating patients in other DRGs. 
 These differences occur for at least two reasons. First, hospitals have an incentive 
to code existing patients into DRGs with higher profit margins (upcoding). Second, 
hospitals also can potentially attract more patients into that diagnosis by offering 
quality or intensity improvements.  Dafny (2005) termed the former  “ nominal 
responses ” because they operate only through accounting changes, and termed the 
latter  “ real responses ” because they relate to changes in resource use for specific 
treatments. 
 In 1988, there was a simple change in the DRG classification system for the Medi-
care program, which in turn generated large and exogenous price changes for 40 
percent of DRG codes, accounting for 43 percent of Medicare admissions. Based on 
a data set containing nearly seven million Medicare admissions covering 186 DRGs 
and 5,352 hospitals nationwide, Dafny (2005) found empirical evidence for nominal 
responses but no evidence of real responses. That is, hospitals responded to these 
price changes by upcoding patients to DRG codes with the largest price increases 
from the retrospective cost reimbursement system to PPS. This nominal response was 
particularly strong among for-profit hospitals. By contrast, hospitals did not increase 
admissions differentially for those patients with diagnoses with the largest price 
increases, nor did they increase the intensity or quality of care provided to patients 
with these diagnoses. The lack of evidence on real responses suggests that hospitals 
do not compete for patients at the diagnosis level. This inference should be consid-
ered more suggestive than conclusive, pending further empirical support from other 
studies. 
 In another study of the effects of the PPS,  Acemoglu and Finkelstein (2008)  char-
acterized the implementation of a PPS as a reform from full-cost to partial-cost reim-
bursement. One reason for maintaining this distinction is that until 2001, hospital 
expenditures on plant and equipment continued to be reimbursed on a retrospective 
cost basis. The program covered other expenses with the fixed price paid per unit of 
output. Thus, the effective price to the hospital of inputs other than for plant and 
equipment (labor, supplies, etc.) increased as a result of the change, but the effective 

522

However, a substantial body of empirical research indicates that although Medicare 
PPS did reduce length of stay and the use of diagnostic procedures after admission 
to the hospital ( Sloan, Morrisey, and Valvona 1988a ,  1988b ), overall, PPS did not 
have adverse effects on patient outcomes (see, e.g.,  Kahn, Keeler, Sherwood, et al. 
1990 ).  
 Physician Payment under Medicare: Fixed Fees Based on a 
Resource-Based Relative Value Scale 
 When Medicare was first implemented, a flexible payment system was used for 
reimbursing physicians. The physician submitted a bill to Medicare for a service 
rendered to a Medicare beneficiary. The company that administered Medicare Part 
B for a particular geographic area (called a  “ carrier, ” in Medicare jargon) applied 
a set of fee screens to determine how much the physician would be paid for the 
service. 
 The carrier first ascertained whether or not the physician ’ s fee was the fee 
the physician usually charged for the service. This was done out of a concern that 
a physician might charge more just because the patient was covered by Medicare. 
If the fee was higher than the usual fee, it was reduced to the usual fee. A second 
screen determined how the physician ’ s usual fee compared to the usual fees of 
price of plant and equipment was left unchanged. In effect, then, implementation of 
the PPS altered the prices of plant and equipment relative to other inputs in the 
production of hospital care. Using a simple neoclassical economic model, Acemoglu 
and Finkelstein argued that the increase in factor prices for inputs other than plant 
and equipment should have led to a decline in demand for these inputs but stimulated 
demand for new medical technologies that are embodied in new plant and equipment. 
This should have decreased demand for labor and encouraged the adoption of new 
medical technologies. 
 Using panel data from US hospitals for the period 1980 – 1986, Acemoglu and 
Finkelstein found empirical support for their hypothesis. Specifically, they found 
there was a statistically significant and sizable increase in the capital-labor ratio in 
hospitals with a relatively high Medicare patient share after implementation of the 
PPS. They also found evidence that after the introduction of the PPS, there was an 
increase in the rate of adoption of several new medical technologies. Their empirical 
findings imply there is a relatively high degree of substitution between technology 
and labor in the production of hospital care. Therefore, the empirical finding from 
several studies is that the introduction of the Medicare PPS was associated with a 
decline in length of stay that may have represented a substitution of high-technology 
capital equipment for relatively labor-intensive hospital stays.

other physicians in the same area. If the fee was in the top 25th percentile of the 
frequency distribution of usual fees, Medicare reduced the fee to the 75th percen-
tile. Finally, under certain circumstances, a higher fee might be justified, for 
example, if a physician spent an unusually long amount of time with a particular 
patient. If sufficient justification was provided, Medicare would pay a higher fee 
than would result from a strict application of the first two screens. 
 The rationale for this approach to paying physicians was to ensure that Medi-
care beneficiaries had access to physicians in the areas where they lived. If fees 
were higher in a particular area, the system was presumably sufficiently flexible 
to reflect this difference. On the other hand, this system could seriously distort the 
fee structure. For example, a young physician setting up practice, realizing that 
Medicare ’ s first screen was the physician ’ s usual fee, would want to set his or her 
fee as close to the top 75th percentile as possible. 
 The alternative to this type of flexible fee arrangement is a fixed fee. In the 
German system, fees are negotiated between an association representing the sick-
ness funds in the state ( Land ) and an association representing sickness fund physi-
cians in the same state. The alternative, which applies in the United States, is for 
the insurer to unilaterally set the fees it pays physicians. In the United States, col-
lective action in the form of direct negotiations by physicians to influence their 
fees would violate antitrust law, although physicians ’ groups can lobby the govern-
ment as political organizations to make changes in public programs, including the 
way that fees are paid. For example, the American Medical Association (AMA) 
makes recommendations to the government about annual updates of the fees Medi-
care pays physicians. In 2010, for example, the AMA recommended to the US 
Congress that Medicare not cut physicians ’ fees by 21 percent. 
 Medicare adopted a system of fixed fees based on the Resource-Based Rela-
tive Value Scale in 1992 ( Hsiao, Braun, Dunn, et al. 1992 ), and the RBRVS approach 
has been adopted as well by many other non-Medicare insurers ( McCormack and 
Burge 1994 ). The  “ relative values ” of the RBRVS are designed to reflect the input 
costs of providing specific services. These costs are for physician work, practice 
expense, and medical malpractice insurance premiums. The mean values of these 
costs are translated into relative value units (RVUs), and payments to physicians 
are calculated by multiplying the combined RVUs of a service by a conversion 
factor — a monetary amount that is determined by the Medicare program. Payments 
are also adjusted for geographic differences in input costs. 
 A key goal of using the RBRVS has been to pay physicians on the basis of the 
cost of doing business. However, for the economy as a whole, prices reflect both 
demand and cost factors. One could imagine pricing a buggy (of horse and buggy) 
using the RBRVS approach. The buggy might be expensive since manufacturing a 
high-quality buggy may be resource-intensive. But in a market, the price of buggies 
reflects individuals ’ willingness to pay for this type of transportation, which in the 
last few decades may be low. Thus, the RBRVS for a buggy might be high, but the 

524 
 Part III / Chapter 12
value to consumers may be low. If so, using RBRVS, buggies would be overpriced, 
and if the market for buggies were similar to that of the market for personal health 
care services, we would have to worry that buggy output would exceed the socially 
optimal amount. Similarly, Medicare may pay a lot for an old technology using the 
RBRVS approach. 
 Traditionally, fees for diagnostic (e.g., interpreting a CT scan) and certain 
therapeutic procedures (e.g., surgical procedures) have been high relative to fees 
for primary care physician visits. One original goal of the RBRVS was to increase 
fees paid for physician visits relative to those paid for diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures. In practice, implementing this change in relative fees has proved to be 
difficult because of potential pressure from those physician stakeholders who 
would tend to lose from this policy change. 
 Starting in the late 1980s, US federal and state governments restricted the 
ability of physicians to  “ balance bill ” for charges in excess of Medicare ’ s co-
payment and reimbursement amounts approved by Medicare, most recently the 
amounts being determined by the RBRVS system.  McKnight (2007)  found that this 
policy change resulted in a 9 percent reduction in out-of-pocket medical expendi-
tures incurred by elderly families. However, she found no evidence that this restric-
tion adversely affected patterns of care. Thus, this restriction of prices paid to 
physicians amounted to a transfer from physicians to elderly persons covered by 
Medicare. We cannot be sure that under different circumstances, such as lower 
physician-to-population ratios and greater restrictions on balance billing, insured 
persons would not experience an increase in barriers to care. 
 Effects of Medicare 
 There is a voluminous empirical literature on the effects of the Medicare program 
in general and of particular features of the program on behavior. We provide a brief 
overview of this literature here. 
 The introduction of Medicare in the 1960s represented the largest single 
change in health insurance coverage in US history.  Finkelstein and McKnight 
(2008)  estimated that the introduction of Medicare was associated with a 40 percent 
decline in out-of-pocket spending for elderly persons with high health care 
expenditures. 
 Technological Change 
 Studies such as the RAND HIE ( Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group 
1993 ), which analyzed data for a relatively short time period (3 – 5 years in the 
case of the HIE), can examine only short-run changes from the expansion of 
health insurance coverage. In the short run, technology is fixed (see chapter 9). But 
technological change occurs over the longer run, and it may be influenced by the 
extent of health insurance coverage as well as by insurer payment practices. If we 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 525
consider only the static effects, the spread of health insurance could explain only 
one-eighth to one-tenth of the increase in real per capita population spending on 
personal health care services in the United States that occurred between 1950 and 
1990. 
 Based on her calculations,  Finkelstein (2007)  concluded that the introduction 
of Medicare can explain about half of the sixfold increase in real per capita 
health care spending that occurred between 1950 and 1990. She speculated that 
growth in health insurance coverage might explain the high rate of growth in 
real per capita health spending in other OECD countries as well. Many OECD 
countries implemented health insurance systems in the 1960s and 1970s ( Cutler 
2002 ). In contrast to  Finkelstein ’ s (2007)  finding,  Acemoglu, Cutler, Finkelstein, 
et al. (2006)  looked for evidence that Medicare induced pharmaceutical innovation. 
They failed to find an effect, but until 2006, Medicare did not cover prescription 
drugs. 
 Population Subgroups 
 A major policy issue in the United States as pertains to Medicare relates to varia-
tion in use of services and health outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries. In a 
frequently cited article published in the  New England Journal of Medicine,   Gornick, 
Eggers, Reilly, et al. (1996)  documented differences in use and outcomes among 
Medicare beneficiaries by income and race. They reported black-white differences 
in mortality of 1.19 for men (i.e., 19 percent higher for black males than for white 
males) and 1.16 for women. These differences are among Medicare beneficiaries 
and do not reflect differences in the probability of reaching age eligibility for Medi-
care between blacks and whites. For every 100 female Medicare beneficiaries, there 
were 26.0 mammograms for whites and 17.1 for blacks. The black-white ratio was 
3.64 for amputation of all or part of the lower limb. For every 1,000 beneficiaries 
there were 515 influenza immunizations among whites and 313 among blacks. 
Adjusting mortality and utilization rates for differences in income (measured for a 
small area [zip code area] in which the beneficiary resided) reduced the black-white 
differences, but not by a large amount. 
 Two economic studies focused on the distributional impacts of Medicare 
( Bhattacharya and Lakdawalla 2006 ;  McClellan and Skinner 2006 ). However, the 
economic studies measured individuals ’ payroll contributions to Medicare as well 
as the benefits from Medicare accruing to the same individuals. In addition, they 
viewed the flow of contributions and benefits as processes occurring over the life 
cycle, unlike previous studies, which used cross-sectional data. Medicare benefits 
increase with the personal income of households, but so do payroll taxes flowing 
to the Medicare program. On an accounting basis, McClellan and Skinner found 
that benefits increased with Medicare beneficiary income more than payroll taxes 
did. However, they acknowledged that concentrating on dollar flows alone ignores 

526 
 Part III / Chapter 12
the insurance value of the Medicare program. Medicare provides health insurance 
to many low-income elderly persons. Because the expenditure risk for such persons 
was reduced after they were covered by Medicare (see chapter 4 for a discussion 
of utility gains from reductions in expenditure risk), previously uninsured persons 
experienced a utility gain that is not reflected in the dollar flow estimates.  Bhat-
tacharya and Lakdawalla (2006 ), using a somewhat different methodology, reached 
the opposite conclusion. They concluded that the distributional impact of Medi-
care is highly progressive, that is, Medicare benefits the poor more than the 
non-poor. 
 To explain the differences in conclusions would require a detailed discussion 
of the empirical methodologies of the studies, which would take us far afield. It is 
sufficient to note that to measure the progressivity of a social insurance program 
such as Medicare, it is necessary to examine the income gradient for both program 
benefits and contributions. Taking both studies together, it appears that at a 
minimum, this type of social insurance program is mildly redistributional, that is, 
progressive. However, we cannot be sure whether or not the same conclusion 
would apply to other countries that have implemented social insurance systems 
for personal health care services. In fact,  O ’ Donnell, van Doorslaer, Rannan-Eliya, 
et al. (2008 ), who studied social insurance program incidence in thirteen Asian 
countries, including both affluent countries such as Japan and lower-income coun-
tries such as Sri Lanka and Nepal, concluded that in high-income countries, social 
insurance is proportional to regressive. This means that higher-income persons in 
such countries derive as much (proportional) or more (regressive) from social insur-
ance than do less affluent individuals in these countries. 
 Population Health 
 Philipson and Becker (1998)  developed the idea that longevity depends in part 
on the availability of mortality-contingent subsidies such as pension programs; 
 “ mortality-contingent ” means that the subsidy is paid only if the person is alive, 
or is paid in lesser amount if the covered person is deceased. Philipson and Becker 
argued that the availability of such income payments increases health investments, 
leading to a longer life. 
 Bethencourt and Galasso (2008)  studied interactions among social insurance 
programs. They argued that there are important political complementaries between 
social insurance programs. For example, to the extent that a social insurance 
program such as Medicare increases longevity, this increases the length of the 
retirement period, which affects the amount of pension benefits accruing to retirees 
from a mortality-contingent pension benefit program. The higher expected pension 
benefit in turn increases political support for government pension programs, even 
among young persons with low incomes. Technological improvements in health 
care strengthen this complementarity and lead to higher levels of welfare 
spending.  

Government Financing and Private Supply

 Box 12.2 
 Does the Provision of Public Health Insurance Lead to Improvements in Population Health? 
 Many countries have implemented health insurance programs financed by the public 
sector. One of the important goals of public health insurance programs, as described 
in various government documents, is to increase individual and population health, 
although the major benefit of health insurance is  “ risk protection. ” However, the 
empirical evidence on whether public health insurance programs really succeed in 
health improvement is very limited. 
 There are two plausible explanations for the lack of such empirical evidence. First, 
most high-income countries implemented public health insurance programs to 
achieve the goal of universal coverage before the 1980s. Thus, the lack of data gener-
ated from these  “ natural experiments ” prevents researchers from investigating this 
issue. Second, even when newly industrialized countries (e.g., South Korea, Taiwan) 
implemented public health insurance programs in more recent years, researchers may 
not have sufficient information to control for the effect of other variables on health 
when the evaluation of public health insurance program relies on comparisons 
between pre and post periods of these policy interventions. 
 Although the United States implemented its Medicare program almost a half 
century ago (in 1966), this program has a unique feature that enables the researcher 
to evaluate the effect of this program by using the more recent complete data without 
having to rely on analysis of old data before 1966. Compared to the public health 
insurance programs adopted in other countries, eligibility for the US Medicare 
program is not completely dependent on the timing of policy implementation; it also 
depends on the individual ’ s age. The vast majority of persons in the United States 
become eligible for Medicare at age 65.  Card, Dobkin, and Maestas (2009) took advan-
tage of this eligibility requirement to investigate the effect of the Medicare program 
on individual health by comparing differences in mortality for severely ill people 
who were admitted to hospitals just before (not eligible for Medicare) and just after 
their 65th birthdays (when eligible for Medicare). 
 Card, Dobkin, and Maestas (2009)  focused on unplanned admissions through the 
emergency department (ED) for patients with diagnoses such as obstructive chronic 
bronchitis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and stroke. These diagnoses are  “ non-
deferrable ” conditions, which means that the decision to seek care at an ED for these 
conditions is unlikely to depend on whether or not the person with symptoms of 
potentially serious disease has health insurance; furthermore, admission rates on 
weekdays and weekends are very similar. 
 Their investigation yielded two important findings. First, there was a modest but 
statistically significant increase in the number of procedures performed in the hos-
pital and a 3 percent rise in total charges for patients at age 65, implying that becoming 
eligible for Medicare leads to an increase in treatment intensity. Second, compared 
to patients who were just under 65, patients who were just over 65 experienced about 
a one percentage point drop in seven-day mortality, which is equivalent to a 20 
percent reduction in deaths within a week of admission. This result suggests that 
Medicare coverage has had an important impact on patient survival.

 Evolution of Payment Systems: The US 
Medicaid Program 
 Background 
 When Medicare was implemented, the Medicaid program was implemented at the 
same time. In contrast to Medicare, Medicaid is a means-tested program that 
focuses on the providing public insurance coverage to the poor. Medicare is a single 
federal program; Medicaid is a federal-state program. The US government subsi-
dizes the cost of the states ’ Medicaid program. The fifty US states design and 
operate their own Medicaid plan, which must conform to federal guidelines. 
Although persons of all ages are eligible for Medicaid, because of the Medicaid 
program ’ s eligibility criteria, enrollees are predominantly infants, young children, 
pregnant women, and the elderly who use long-term care services, particularly 
nursing homes. Many low-income elderly persons are covered by both Medicaid 
and Medicare. While Medicare provides the basic benefit for physician and hospi-
tal services and recently for prescription drugs, Medicare has a very limited nursing 
home benefit. This coverage gap is plugged by Medicaid for elderly with low 
income and wealth. Originally, Medicaid programs were linked to receipt of public 
assistance. This link has been severed at various dates, depending on changes in 
federal and states ’ laws since the 1980s. 
 As a means-tested program, Medicaid ’ s economic issues differ substantially 
from those for a non-means-tested program such as Medicare and a practically 
non-means-tested program such as the German SHI plan. First, in all states, Med-
icaid covers only a minority of the population, often around 10 percent or less. 
Second, people can affect their eligibility for Medicaid benefits by altering their 
income and wealth. Thus, market work and saving are potentially affected by the 
availability of Medicaid benefits. Third, Medicaid payments for hospital care and 
physicians ’  services are low relative to those of private insurers and Medicare. 
While virtually all US hospitals accept Medicaid payment, many physicians do 
not. Fourth, since Medicaid pays for nursing home care, there are concerns about 
the effect of Medicaid payment policies on nursing home decisions, including the 
quality of care provided to nursing home residents. There is concern for both 
Medicaid-sponsored and as well as other persons since Medicaid requires that a 
nursing home provide the same level of care for both Medicaid and non-Medicaid 
recipients who reside in the same nursing home. 
 Choice of Medicaid Benefits versus Self-Insurance versus 
Private Insurance 
 An insight of microeconomic theory is that people make choices about their income, 
savings, hours devoted to market and household production, and personal health 
based in part on prices and other constraints they face. Personal health care services 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 529
can be financed by a combination of public and private insurance and self-
insurance. When an individual self insures, he or she finances personal health care 
services from personal income and wealth. People can affect their eligibility for 
means-tested insurance, such as Medicaid, by altering their incomes and wealth 
( Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes 1995 ). However, given what some persons see as 
the stigma of receiving means-tested benefits and other factors, some persons, even 
if eligible, may not apply for the benefit (see, e.g.,  Moffitt and Galloway 1992 ;  Currie 
and Gruber 1996 ). 
 Consider the relationship between purchasing private insurance when a 
public insurance program is not available or, alternatively, available (  fig. 12.1 ). The 
choice is between paying a premium to purchase private insurance and consuming 
other goods. If the individual purchases a more comprehensive insurance policy, 
there is less income available for the purchase of other goods. More insurance 
requires paying a higher premium. Without a means-tested public insurance 
program, the household budget constraint is  AC . 
 Figure 12.1  shows two tangencies between indifference curves showing the 
individual ’ s trade-off between insurance and other goods and the budget constraint 
 AC . More risk-averse individuals are at  D ; less risk-averse persons are at  E .  
 Now suppose that a means-tested public insurance program offering a fixed 
amount of insurance — CM units of health insurance — at no premium cost to the 
 Figure 12.1

individual. Now the choice is between consuming  CM  units of insurance and  OC 
units of other goods or more health insurance than  CM  and fewer units of other 
goods. The budget constraint becomes  ABMC . If the individual wants more health 
insurance than is offered by the public plan,  CM , the person rejects the public plan 
and buys a private policy offering more generous coverage. This is precisely the 
option faced by Germans with incomes over a certain threshold amount; they can 
reject statutory health insurance and select a private alternative. 
 The individual ’ s choice in   figure 12.1 when public health insurance is offered 
involves a comparison of utility at point  M with utility at a point on the original 
budget constraint to the northwest of point  B . If the indifference curve is relatively 
steep, which suggests that the marginal utility of having health insurance relative 
to the marginal utility of other goods is comparatively high, the person is likely to 
select a combination of health insurance and other goods on the original budget 
constraint to the northwest of  B . In this case, the provision of public health insur-
ance will have no effect on the person ’ s demand for private health insurance. 
However, if the indifference curve is relatively flat, the person may well select the 
combination of health insurance and other goods at point  M ; in this case, the 
person does not buy private health insurance, and the availability of public health 
insurance can be said to have  “ crowded out ” the demand for private health 
insurance. 
 The introduction of public insurance  “ crowds out ” private insurance demand 
in one case but not in the other. Realistically, people have different preferences. 
Thus, although not every individual ’ s demand for private health insurance is 
crowded out, private demand on the part of some individuals is crowded out when 
public health insurance is made available. 
 One may ask, why do we care? We care because the goal of providing public 
health insurance coverage is largely to increase the proportion of the population 
with health insurance coverage. To the extent that there is crowding out, this public 
policy objective is not met. 
 Figure 12.1  is drawn for a person with a fixed income. In practice, the intro-
duction of public insurance may also crowd out private savings since less money 
is needed for precautionary savings for use in the event of a health shock ( Hubbard, 
Skinner, and Zeldes 1995 ;  Chou, Liu, and Hammitt 2003 ). Precautionary savings 
are savings for use following an adverse event, such as an accident or illness. If 
the family has public health insurance, there is less reason to save for this reason. 
The household may still have precautionary savings for other reasons, such as in 
the event of property damage due to fire or an earthquake, hazards not covered by 
health insurance. 
 Market work may be reduced by the availability of means-tested public health 
insurance to the extent that working reduces the probability of eligibility for 
the public insurance plan.  Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995)  argued that 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 531
lower-income individuals and those with less human capital tend to accumulate 
less private wealth in part because of the availability of public safety nets, includ-
ing public health insurance. 
 Several empirical studies have assessed the extent to which the availability 
of Medicaid has crowded out private health insurance. The study by  Cutler and 
Gruber (1996)  took advantage of the exogenous (to individuals) Medicaid expan-
sions in eligibility for benefits to pregnant women and children that occurred 
during 1987 – 1992. They estimated that about 50 percent of the increase in Medic-
aid coverage was associated with a reduction in private health insurance coverage —
 a substantial amount of crowding out. This reduction mainly occurred because 
employees took up employer-based health insurance less often, thereby saving the 
monthly payroll deductions for their share of health insurance premiums.  Hamm 
and Shore-Sheppard (2005)  attempted to replicate Cutler and Gruber ’ s findings 
using another database. They found substantially less crowding out of private 
health insurance than Cutler and Gruber reported. More recently,  Gruber and 
Simon (2007)  used the same database as Hamm and Shore-Shepard but incorpo-
rated some recent changes in public insurance program policy. They concluded 
that public insurance has a substantial crowding-out effect on private health insur-
ance plan enrollments. Clearly, the results are sensitive to how the empirical analy-
sis is conducted, which data sources are used, and which time periods are 
analyzed. 
 Yelowitz (1995)  examined the effects of a change in eligibility requirements 
that allowed women with infants and young children to earn more without losing 
eligibility for Medicaid benefits. He found that the change in eligibility standards 
that allowed a mother ’ s earnings to increase without losing eligibility for Medicaid 
resulted in a decrease in receipt of public assistance benefits and an increase in 
labor force participation among these women. The effects were large for ever 
married women but negligible for never married women. Overall, these results 
provide at least partial support of another form of crowding out, namely, the avail-
ability of means-tested government health insurance may crowd out market 
work. 
 Gruber and Yelowitz (1999)  analyzed the effect of means-tested public insur-
ance, more specifically Medicaid, on the savings behavior of households. They too 
relied on Medicaid eligibility expansions to assess the impact of Medicaid eligibil-
ity on personal wealth accumulation. They found that eligibility for Medicaid 
benefits had a sizable negative effect on both personal wealth and personal con-
sumption. Increased consumption coincided with lower amounts of saving. 
 Thus far, we have stressed distortions caused from the introduction of a 
public health insurance plan such as Medicaid. However, while these distortions 
exact welfare costs on society, it is also important to consider these programs ’ social 
benefits.  Currie and Thomas (1995)  found that relative to no insurance, Medicaid 

532 
 Part III / Chapter 12
coverage increased the probability that a child had a routine checkup in the past 
year by 15 percent.  Currie and Gruber (1996)  examined the effects of Medicaid 
eligibility expansions on the utilization of medical care and on child health, finding 
substantial increases in use of care that were broadly consistent with the findings 
of Currie and Thomas, as well as reductions in child mortality. 
 The astute reader may attribute the increase in utilization to moral hazard 
and recall the discussion in chapter 3 about the welfare loss from excess health 
insurance. However, the reduction in child mortality that Currie and Gruber docu-
mented shows the increase in coverage brought about by the expansions in Med-
icaid availability also had benefits. 
 Empirical Evidence on Medicaid Fee Schedules 
 Research on Medicaid using the price discrimination model was described in 
chapter 5. This research focused on physician office practices. 
 More recent research has focused on shifts of Medicaid-covered patients from 
hospital outpatient settings to physicians ’ offices. The presumption is that continu-
ity of care is better and care is more personal in physicians ’ offices. For example, 
 Gruber, Adams, and Newhouse (1997)  investigated whether or not a shift from 
hospital outpatient clinics to physicians ’ offices occurred after the Medicaid 
program in Tennessee increased its fee schedules. The control group was the US 
state of Georgia, which did not raise its Medicaid fees. The authors found that care 
shifted from clinics (other than hospital outpatient clinics) to offices, but not from 
hospital outpatient clinics or emergency rooms to offices. They did find that inpa-
tient admissions of Medicaid enrollees fell after the fee increase in Tennessee. 
Thus, overall, the evidence was mixed. 
 An expansion of Medicaid eligibility may mean a higher number of persons 
in the Medicaid market and fewer persons in the market in which physicians set 
prices. An inward shift in the private market demand curve should make physi-
cians more willing to accept Medicaid patients.  Baker and Royalty (2000)  found 
that the increased Medicaid enrollees following eligibility expansions went to 
public clinics and hospital clinics rather than to private physicians ’ offices. 
 Medicaid fee policy may also affect the mix of services provided to Medicaid 
recipients.  Gruber, Kim, and Mayzlin (1999)  evaluated whether or not an increase 
in the relative Medicaid fee for a normal obstetric delivery versus a cesarean section 
delivery affects choice of delivery method. They found that larger Medicaid fee 
differentials between cesarean and normal deliveries tend to lead to higher rates 
of C-sections. 
 The price-discriminating monopoly model of physician behavior described 
in chapter 5 assumes that Medicaid fee schedules do not affect quality of care, only 
physicians ’  decisions about output.  Gray (2001)  investigated the relationship 
between Medicaid payment levels and quality of care empirically, finding that a 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 533
10 percent higher than average relative Medicaid fee was independently associated 
with a 7.4 percent lower absolute risk of low birth weight and a 3.5 percent lower 
risk of very low birth weight, both outcome-based measures of quality of care. Both 
estimates applied to women covered by Medicaid. Since premature births and low 
birth weight led to a higher health care cost of caring for infants, there were cost 
offsets from avoiding low and very low birth weight, as well as benefits to families 
and other from delivering healthier children. 
 Medicaid and Nursing Home Care 
 In contrast to the other major types of personal health care services, the primary 
sources of revenue for the US nursing home industry are out-of-pocket payments 
by residents and their families ( “ self-pay ” ) and Medicaid. In many cases, nursing 
home residents are admitted as self-pay patients. However, after long stays and 
considerable out-of-pocket expense, these patients deplete assets to the point that 
they become Medicaid-eligible. The process of depleting assets while living in a 
nursing home is called  “ spending down. ” Because Medicaid is such an important 
revenue source for nursing homes, its policies have important impacts on these 
facilities. There is empirical evidence that specific incentives that might be imple-
mented by Medicaid plans affect both the cost and quality of nursing home care 
(see, e.g.,  Norton 1992 ). 
 Given that private prices tend to be much higher than prices paid to nursing 
homes by Medicaid, variants of the two-market price discrimination model (see 
chapter 5) have been used to study US nursing home behavior in general and the 
effects of Medicaid policies on such behavior in particular (e.g.,  Dusansky 1989 ; 
 Gertler 1989 ;  Cohen and Spector 1996 ;  Nyman 1999 ). In the nursing home models, 
authors stress the requirement that the quality of care be the same in caring for 
non-Medicaid and Medicaid nursing home residents. In contrast to US physicians, 
nursing homes in the United States are often subject to certificate of need entry 
regulation (see chapter 6) and to moratoria on nursing home bed construction in 
particular. 
 Economic models of nursing home behavior typically assume that given the 
large number of elderly persons who are either eligible for Medicaid or could 
become eligible, there is very high Medicaid demand for nursing home care. In the 
presence of a binding nursing home bed constraint, nursing homes compete for 
non-Medicaid residents on the basis of the quality of care they offer (presumably 
as well as on price). Since there are so many Medicaid residents, however, nursing 
homes are able to fill their facilities with such residents even if they do not offer 
high quality. But if they want to be able to admit non-Medicaid residents, nursing 
homes must offer high quality of care to residents; furthermore, Medicaid requires 
that the same level of quality be provided to Medicaid residents at the same facility 
as is provided to self-pay and privately insured residents. When Medicaid raises 

534 
 Part III / Chapter 12
its level of reimbursement, nursing homes become less interested in attracting non-
Medicaid residents (self-payers and the privately insured). Thus, since there are so 
many potential Medicaid residents, especially when there is a binding bed con-
straint resulting from certificate of need laws, nursing homes can lower quality and 
fill their facilities with such persons. For this reason, there is a negative relation-
ship between Medicaid payment levels and nursing home quality. 
 David  Grabowski (2001) , using national data and an outcomes-based measure 
of quality of nursing home care, in contrast to earlier studies found a positive but 
small relationship between Medicaid payment levels and quality of care — evidence 
that is contrary to earlier economic studies, which reported a negative relationship. 
Grabowski attributed part of the reason for the difference between his findings and 
the findings of the earlier studies to a general decline in nursing home utilization 
in the United States toward the end of the twentieth century. 
 12.5 
 Evolution of Payment Systems: Canada ’ s 
Medicare 
 Background 
 Canada ’ s Medicare program is unique among major industrialized countries ’ public 
insurance programs in not allowing private health insurance plans or private out-
of-pocket payment to supplement amounts paid by the public health insurance 
plan for covered services. Private supplementary insurance for services not covered 
by Medicare is permitted. In this sense, Canada does not have a two- or a multi-
tiered health care system. Although Canadian Medicare is partly financed by the 
national government, constitutionally, the provinces have primary responsibility 
for the financing and delivery of personal health care services. Provincial health 
ministries negotiate physician fee schedules with provincial medical associations 
and the level of capital expenditures and annual global operating budgets of hos-
pitals ( Hoffmeyer and McCarthy 1994 , 274 – 275). 
 Patients pay a zero money price for physicians ’ services at the point of service 
delivery. However, to control expenditures on physicians ’ services, some provinces 
have imposed ceilings on the amount that general practitioners can bill the pro-
vincial plan for their services. By employing hospital-specific global operating 
budgets (fixed amounts paid by Medicare to the hospital that do not increase as 
spending by the hospital increases) and controlling the capital expenditures of 
hospitals, provincial governments determine the diffusion of new medical technol-
ogy. Provincial governments control which facilities are to receive capital and 
operating funds for particular technologies. 
 Patients have a complete choice of physician. Medicare imposes no restric-
tions on such choices, in contrast to many managed care plans in the United States. 
Almost all physicians practice on a fee-for-service basis and are in private practice. 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 535
Individual physicians are price takers and do not face the variety of fee schedules 
offered by various payers as in the United States. The only way to increase physi-
cian practice revenue is by increasing volume of service, which the ceilings just 
described seek to counteract. 
 Each provincial Medicare program has substantial market power vis- à -vis 
physician and hospital providers. In principle, physician fees are negotiated bilat-
erally, as in Germany, at the provincial level between the Ministry of Health and 
the medical association. In practice, several provinces have reduced their fee 
schedules unilaterally, and some provinces have imposed limits on quarterly gross 
billings allowed for individual physicians. 
 Global budgets for hospital operating cost provide a powerful incentive for 
cost control, but they can also have adverse side effects. For example, a hospital 
with a revenue cap from Medicare specified by the global budget can reduce its 
cost by increasing length of stay. Since per diem cost typically declines as length 
of stay increases, hospitals can keep patient  “ bed blockers ” in the hospital (a bed 
filled by one patient is not available for another) and prevent other, more costly 
persons (at least during the first days of their admission) from being admitted. 
Another type of bed blocker is a patient who requires only low-intensity care. 
 Bed blockers introduce two types of inefficiency. First, the marginal benefit 
from an increased length of stay may be below the marginal cost of extending the 
stay. Second, patients requiring low-intensity care may be treated as well in less 
costly settings than a hospital, such as on an outpatient basis. 
 Effects of the Canadian Medicare Program 
 Since Medicare relies on control of supply to achieve cost containment rather than 
such demand-side cost containment mechanisms as cost sharing, studies have 
examined indicators of non-price rationing and, to the extent that such rationing 
exists, the effects of such rationing on health services use and health outcomes. 
 Patient Waiting Time to Receipt of Care 
 One frequently heard complaint about the Canadian system, especially among 
opponents of single-payer systems in the United States, is that there are long 
waiting lists for receipt of care. Such complaints are largely based on anecdotes. 
However, there is some empirical evidence on this issue.  Coyte, Wright, Hawker, 
et al. (1994)  compared waiting times for receipt of knee replacement surgery in the 
United States and in Ontario, Canada. Most knee replacements are to relieve pain 
and are not medical emergencies. The median waiting time for an initial orthopedic 
consultation was two weeks in the United States and four weeks in Ontario. Median 
waiting time for knee replacement after the operation had been planned was three 
weeks in the United States and eight weeks in Ontario. 
 Hamilton, Ho, and Goldman (2000)  compared waiting times for hip fracture 
surgery, often not an elective procedure, and the impacts of delays to surgery 
on length of stay in the hospital after the operation and on hospital inpatient 

536 
 Part III / Chapter 12
mortality in the United States and Canada. Waiting times for such surgery were 
longer in Canada than in the United States, and longer waiting times led to longer 
lengths of hospital stays. However, there were no differences between the two 
countries in inpatient mortality rates among persons who had this type of surgery. 
 Even when procedures can be postponed without medical consequences, 
waiting longer may lead to more pain and discomfort and worry about the impend-
ing surgery. These are very real societal costs,though not frequently quantified. 
 Use of Costly Procedures 
 Several studies indicated that heart attack victims in the United States had higher 
rates of use of invasive cardiac procedures than in Canada. For example,  Rouleau, 
Moye, Pfeffer, et al. (1993 ) found that a higher percentage of patients admitted to 
hospital coronary care units in Canada had had heart attacks than in the United 
States, implying a higher severity of illness threshold for provision of intensive 
care in Canada than in the United States (but with no difference in mortality or 
rates of repeated heart attacks between the two countries, though more Canadians 
had activity-limiting chest pain afterward). However,  Ko, Krumholz, Wang, et al. 
(2007),  who compared rates of use of such procedures in the northeastern United 
States and in in nearby Ontario, found similar rates of use. This finding implies 
that the differentials documented in the previous studies were likely due to regional 
differences in practice patterns within the two countries rather than to differences 
in capacity in between the two countries. 
 Disparities in Health and in the Use of Services 
 Canada has made an unusual effort to create a one-tier health system. Thus, it is 
of some interest whether the disparities in use and in health outcomes evident in 
other countries, particularly the United States, also exist in Canada. In a review of 
the literature on this issue,  Birch and Gafni (2005) concluded that Canadian Medi-
care has reduced disparities in health care use and health outcomes by income. 
However, income-based differences in use still exist ( Roos and Mustard 1997 ;  Alter, 
Naylor, Austin, et al. 1999 ;  Dunlop, Coyte, and McIsaac 2000 ), as do disparities in 
the use of non-Medicare-covered services, such as dental care.

 Evolution of Payment Systems in Asian 
Countries on the Pacific Rim 
 Background 
 Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan all have social insurance systems for health care 
and mainly rely on the private provision of personal health care services. All three 
countries rely on social insurance for half of health care spending, with South 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 537
Korea slightly less than half. Appreciable shares of spending in 2001 – 2002 came 
from out-of-pocket outlays in all three countries, most in South Korea (about 40 
percent) and least in Japan (about 20 percent). The high share of out-of-pocket 
payments in Korea reflects that the lack of insurance coverage for many services 
continues, and people pay for these services out of pocket ( Kwon 2003 ). Private 
health insurance accounts for a small share of revenue in Taiwan and a negligible 
share in the other two countries. 
 Japan 
 Japan is the most populous and affluent of the three countries. Japan ’ s health 
system, implemented in the late 1950s ( Ramseyer 2009 ), adopted the German 
system as it existed well before World War II. Insurance is provided by a patchwork 
of private-employment-based plans and government plans. As in the United States 
and Germany, most persons in Japan obtain their health insurance through their 
place of employment. A separate insurance plan is available for persons who are 
not eligible for health insurance through employment, such as retirees. 
 Enrollment in an insurance plan has been mandatory for all persons since 
1961. There are five major sources of funding for personal health care services in 
Japan: participants ’ premiums paid to various insurers, with premiums being pro-
portional to income; employer-employee matching contributions to employment-
based health insurance plans; patient co-payments to hospitals, clinics (physicians), 
and pharmacies; national government subsidies; and local government subsidies 
( Rapp and Shibuya 1994 , 594;  Ikegami and Campbell 1995 ). There are over 5,000 
employer-based plans, each with its own contribution rate ( Wagstaff 2007 ). Tax 
revenue includes revenue from personal income, corporate income, and consump-
tion taxes ( Ogura, Kadoda, and Kawamura 2006 , 87). 
 Compared to Canada and even to the US public health insurance programs, 
patient cost sharing is high in Japan. The coinsurance rate (share of expense borne 
out of pocket by the patient) is 30 percent except among the elderly, for whom the 
coinsurance rate is 10 percent ( Yashiro, Suzuki, and Suzuki 2006 , 22). Private 
insurers are only allowed to offer coverage for expenses not covered by the univer-
sal health insurance program. 
 Despite the existence of multiple insurers, payments to providers all flow 
from a single source, as in the German system, where payments to physicians are 
funneled though the state ’ s ( Land ’ s) association of sickness fund physicians ’ orga-
nizations. There is a uniform fee schedule that applies to all health plans. As is 
usually the case, the United States being the major exception, the fee schedule is 
negotiated between the Japan Medical Association and the Ministry of Health and 
Welfare. When these bilateral negotiations first began, the negotiation process was 
acrimonious. Since then, the parties have recognized that they need each other, 
and the negotiations have gone more smoothly. In contrast to the German system, 
where negotiations take place at the state level, in Japan, negotiation is on a 

538 
 Part III / Chapter 12
national basis. Unlike in the United States and other countries, such as Germany, 
hospital and physicians ’ fees are not separated in Japan ( Yajima and Takayanagi 
2002 , 466). 
 The fee schedule lists all procedures and products that can be paid by the 
universal health insurance program as well as the prices associated with each code. 
As in the other systems discussed thus far in this chapter, with the exception of 
US Medicare, balance billing over the official fee schedule is prohibited. While 
most providers are wholly reliant on revenue from services provided as the single 
source of revenue, public sector and academic hospitals also receive direct subsi-
dies from governments (mostly local governments) or university budgets for capital 
and even some operating expenses ( Ikegami and Campbell 1995 ). In practice, the 
prices of procedures that show large increases in volume are frequently reduced, 
as has happened with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. In this way, 
the financial impact of introducing new technologies can be negated ( Ikegami and 
Campbell 2004 ). In Japan, government authorities undertake a biannual review of 
each of more than 3,000 items, rather than making across-the-board proportionate 
changes to all fees ( Wagstaff 2007 ), as is the practice of US Medicare. While Japan 
has achieved cost containment by limiting fees, capping prices on complex proce-
dures has reduced the incentive physicians would otherwise have had to invest in 
specialized expertise and technologies ( Ramseyer 2009 ). 
 Patients have almost complete freedom of choice of physician. Unlike in the 
United States, where group practice predominates, almost all physicians in Japan 
are in solo practice, and most hospitals are small organizations linked to physi-
cians ’  offices. Most large hospitals are government-owned or are private not-for-
profit, either linked to universities or free-standing. Unlike in the United States, 
for-profit investor-owned hospitals are prohibited in Japan. 
 There is some control of entry of health care providers. Japan began to control 
the number of hospital beds in 1985. The government has specified the number of 
beds needed in several hundred areas of the country. Physicians are prohibited 
from increasing the number of beds in areas in which bed supply is deemed to be 
adequate. The government has also frozen the number of places in medical schools 
in the country ( Yashiro, Suzuki, and Suzuki 2006 , 30). 
 As in Germany, but unlike in the United States, office-based physicians 
cannot care for their patients while they are in the hospital. Instead, physicians ’ 
services in the hospital are delivered by hospital-based physicians, who are paid 
on a salaried basis and hence are not rewarded financially for providing a greater 
volume of service. Hospitalization rates in Japan are extremely low by international 
standards, but rates of use of physicians ’ services and prescription drugs are rela-
tively high. 
 Prescription drugs in Japan and in other East Asian countries have followed 
the Chinese tradition in which there is no formal separation between pharmacists 
and physicians. Physicians and hospitals derive a special fee from dispensing 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 539
prescription drugs. The provider buys drugs at wholesale prices and sells them at 
retail prices. In 1995, the difference between wholesale and retail prices was 26 
percent on average ( Ikegami and Campbell 1995 , 1296). Japanese physicians often 
sell higher-priced drugs because expensive drugs result in higher profit margins 
( Yoshikawa and Bhattacharya 2002 , 257). 
 Japan ranks highest in the world in terms of life expectancy at birth, and it 
ranks high on other dimensions of health as well (e.g., infant mortality, percentage 
of infants born who are low birth weight or very low birth weight). However, this 
long life expectancy may have as much or even more to do with health behaviors 
and the relative equality of the income distribution in Japan than with access to 
care and the quality of the health care delivery ( Tsuda, Aoyama, and Froom 1994 ; 
 Bezruchka, Namekata, and Sistrom 2008 ). 
 South Korea 
 As in Taiwan, the process of implementing universal coverage in South Korea 
occurred in two major steps. First, South Korea extended national health insurance 
in 1989 to almost all of its population (97 percent). The remaining three percent 
are covered by a public insurance program focusing on the poor, a program also 
established in 1977. Second, up to the year 2000, insurance was provided by mul-
tiple social insurers. In that year, more than 350 health insurance societies were 
merged into a single National Health Insurance (NHI) Corporation ( Lee, Chun, Lee, 
et al. 2008 ). Insurance remains tied to place of employment; insurance coverage is 
mandatory. The government has key roles in regulating insurance and in setting 
benefit levels and fee levels to be paid to health care providers (see, e.g.,  Gauld, 
Ikegami, Barr, et al. 2006 ). 
 A notable characteristic of the South Korean system is the high level of patient 
cost sharing. In addition, many common but expensive high-technology services, 
such as MRI, fall outside the NHI benefit package. Mandatory health insurance 
coverage was first established in 1977 for firms with more than 500 employees. 
This suggests that South Korea achieved the goal of universal coverage through a 
strategy of a combination of a low benefit level but wide coverage. As a result, 
about 45 percent of health expenditures are financed from private sources — 37 
percent from out-of-pocket payments and 8 percent from private insurance and 
other private sources ( Gauld, Ikegami, Barr, et al. 2006 ). 
 In South Korea, following implementation of the first phase of mandatory 
coverage, the mean number of ambulatory visits rose from 1.3 per year in 1977 to 
6.9 in 1985 ( Peabody, Lee, and Bickel 1995 ). A common strategy employed by the 
insurance societies, in effect until 2000, was to increase co-payments. Although 
there appears to be no rigorous empirical evaluation of this, the perception is that 
increased co-payments did not decrease utilization rates. Physicians could increase 
the volume of services provided in two ways, by providing more frequent, shorter 
visits and by unbundling or relabeling services to reflect additional or more complex 

540 
 Part III / Chapter 12
services.  Peabody, Lee, and Bickel (1995) cited evidence that physician office visits 
average three minutes per patient, versus 10 – 15 minutes in other developed 
countries. 
 Physicians are paid on a fee-for-service basis. In the late 1990s, a DRG payment 
system was introduced on a pilot basis. An RBRVS fee schedule for physicians was 
introduced in 2001 ( Kwon 2003 ). The private sector plays a dominant role in pro-
viding health care services. A substantial share of South Korean hospitals are 
organized on a for-profit basis, which physicians own and manage. Fewer than 10 
percent of hospitals are public. 
 As in many East Asian countries, in South Korea physicians both prescribe 
and dispense drugs. This practice, in combination with direct government price 
controls on pharmaceutical products, puts physicians and hospitals in a position 
to earn profits directly from the sales of prescription drugs. Given the profit margin 
for prescription drugs, providers have financial incentives to substitute prescrip-
tion drugs for other inputs, such as time spent on diagnosis or on surgical treat-
ment. Spending on pharmaceuticals consequently accounts for a larger share of 
health care expenditures in South Korea. In 2004, the share of health care expen-
ditures spent on drugs ranged from 10 to 20 percent among most high-income 
countries. However, like Taiwan, South Korea allocates more than a quarter of its 
health care expenditures to drugs. 
 In response to the rapidly rising share of pharmaceutical expenditures, South 
Korea adopted two major pharmaceutical reforms in recent years. First, in July 
2000, the Korean government adopted a mandated separation policy between drug 
prescribing and dispensing. This reform stimulated significant opposition from 
physicians, including strikes, which in turn forced the government to substantially 
increase physician fees to compensate for the income loss from the separation of 
drug prescribing and dispensing ( Kwon 2003 ). At the same time, South Korea 
increased coverage of prescription drugs, which has led to a substantial increase 
in the use of prescription drugs, including high-priced drugs ( Jeong 2005 ;  Kim and 
Ruger 2008 ). Second, in 2008, South Korea became the first Asian country to adopt 
economic evaluation in the reimbursement decision of new drugs ( Yang, Bae, and 
Kim 2008 ). 
 Taiwan 
 Taiwan began to adopt the social insurance approach in 1950. The program was 
first made available to industrial workers and covered only about two percent of 
the total population in that year. In 1995, Taiwan achieved universal health cover-
age by integrating the three existing programs into a single system and expanding 
coverage to the uninsured population. This development process suggests that 
universal health insurance was not created in one day. Instead, health insurance 
was adopted piecemeal over a 45-year period, and expansion of coverage was slow, 
proceeding sector by sector. The percentage of the population covered by public 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 541
insurance programs reached 49 percent in 1991, with the public sector contributing 
about half of health care financing. After the implementation of universal coverage, 
the share of public financing increased to about 63 percent. 
 Following the expansion in insurance coverage and economic growth, real 
health expenditure per capita increased rapidly and exceeded the mean real eco-
nomic growth rate between 1991 and 2006. As a result, the share of GDP spent on 
health care increased from 4.4 percent in 1991 to 6.1 percent in 2006. 
 The universal health insurance program is known as national health insur-
ance (NHI) in Taiwan (see chapter 3, box 3.4). After NHI was implemented, the 
government introduced new payment systems to control rising health care expen-
ditures. Most noteworthy are the single-payer system and global budgets. The 
single-payer system employs a uniform fee schedule to reimburse providers in all 
geographic regions. A single-payer system achieves cost containment in part by 
being administratively simple, thus substantially reducing administrative overhead 
as compared to other systems, and by conferring monopsony power on the pur-
chaser of services in setting fee schedules. Lower prices in turn lower public 
expenditures under NHI ( Chiang 1997 ;  Reinhardt 2007 ). 
 In addition, the government has had the advantage of being able to learn from 
the experiences of Canada, Germany, and France, which adopted global budgets 
earlier as a cost-containment strategy. The global budgets were divided into sub-
budgets by type of services, and implementation was incremental. This system was 
first applied to dental services in July 1998. Then, based on the experiences gained 
from implementing this initial pilot experiment, global budgets were subsequently 
applied to Chinese traditional medicine in July 2000, to outpatient clinic services 
in July 2001, and to the hospital sector in July 2002. 
 Taiwan ’ s health care delivery system has changed over time. After World War 
II, Taiwan relied on public provision. Public hospitals accounted for more than 90 
percent of the market share in terms of the number of hospital beds. However, after 
years of economic growth, many large, private, not-for-profit hospitals entered the 
market. The market share of public hospitals consequently declined steadily and 
the health care system in Taiwan rapidly became one in which the private sector 
dominated the supply of personal health care services. By 2000 the market share 
of private hospitals had increased to about 70 percent. In addition, almost all phy-
sician clinics are now owned by the private sector. 
 Like those in many Asian countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea, 
the hospitals in Taiwan employ a closed-staff system, under which almost all phy-
sicians who practice in hospitals are employees of those hospitals and physicians 
who practice in clinics do not have admitting privileges at hospitals. Patients are 
free to choose their own providers; that is, there is no gatekeeper mechanism. 
Under a closed-staff system, except in emergency cases, patients who receive inpa-
tient services mainly come from the outpatient department of the same hospital. 
Thus, to increase the flow of inpatients, hospitals in Taiwan have a strong incentive 

542 
 Part III / Chapter 12
to operate a large outpatient department. As a result, local clinics and hospitals 
compete for outpatient services, and the referral system is almost nonexistent. 
 Effects of Universal Health Insurance 
 In all three East Asian countries, the out-of-pocket share declined appreciably after 
the implementation of universal health insurance, which occurred in 1961 in 
Japan, in 1989 in South Korea, and in 1995 in Taiwan (  fig. 12.2 ). In 1993, before 
Taiwan implemented its universal health insurance program, out-of-pocket pay-
ments for health care amounted to 48 percent of the total. By 2000, out-of-pocket 
payments had declined to 30 percent ( Lu and Hsiao 2003 ). Interestingly, in Singa-
pore, which introduced medical savings accounts in 1984, a form of cost sharing 
which imposes a substantial deductible before insurance coverage takes effect, 
there was no decrease in the out-of-pocket share following implementation of this 
policy (see   fig. 12.2 ).  
 Social insurance contributions are regressive in all three countries, which is 
attributable to income-based ceilings placed on such contributions ( Wagstaff 2007 ). 
Such ceilings are not imposed on payroll contributions to US Medicare. In South 
Korea and Taiwan, but not in Japan, there are exemptions or reduced contribution

rates for the poorest individuals, as well as some government subsidies for coverage 
of such persons. 
 The World Health Organization has developed an index to measure inequality 
in the share of households ’ income spent on personal health care services. The 
value of the index ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the most equitable dis-
tribution of health care financing. In 1998, Taiwan had a value of 0.992 versus 
0.881 in 1994, the year before universal coverage was implemented in that country. 
By comparison, Japan had a value of 0.977, Canada 0.974, Germany 0.978, and the 
United States 0.954. The implementation of universal coverage in Taiwan clearly 
increased equality in the share of household income devoted to health care, but it 
also brought the country up to the level of other countries with social health insur-
ance systems. 
 The single-payer system in Taiwan has achieved cost containment not 
achieved by similar programs, such as Medicare in the United States.  Lu and Hsiao 
(2003)  attributed the fact that Taiwan could cover a large number of previously 
uninsured persons at basically no incremental cost to several factors, including the 
implementation of higher cost sharing for some previously insured persons, the 
introduction of a DRG-type payment system for high-volume hospital services, and 
the use of global budgets for several types of services. To know whether or not 
these policies truly achieved cost containment would require a more rigorous 
evaluation than has been conducted. Further, even if cost containment is achieved, 
it is not at all clear that the use of these various non-price rationing devices really 
increases social welfare. This too remains to be demonstrated. 
 The use of personal health care services in Taiwan has risen following imple-
mentation of universal health insurance coverage.  Chen, Yip, Chang, et al. (2007 ) 
reported that among previously uninsured elderly persons, the proportion of such 
persons receiving outpatient care increased by nearly 28 percent as compared with 
a much smaller increase, 13 percent, for elderly persons who were previously 
insured. They attributed the 15 percent difference to the effect of implementing 
universal health insurance coverage. Even three years later, the difference in utili-
zation between the two groups remained at 11 percent. Similar patterns were 
observed for the utilization of hospital inpatient care. In addition, they found that 
utilization increased in relative terms for lower-income persons, suggesting that 
implementation of universal coverage had the effect of redistributing services to 
lower-income families. By contrast, the authors did not find an effect of universal 
coverage in Taiwan on health status as measured by either the one-year mortality 
rate or self-reported health status. 
 In addition to the demand side, the implementation of universal coverage has 
had an important effect on the supply side. As  Finkelstein (2007)  observed for the 
United States, the introduction of NHI in Taiwan increased the entry of large hos-
pitals and the exit of small hospitals, with the result that mean hospital size has 
increased over time. Furthermore, implementation of NHI encouraged hospitals to 

544 
 Part III / Chapter 12
invest in new advanced medical technologies, such as CT scanners, radiation 
isotope therapeutic equipment, and linear accelerators.  Chou, Liu, and Hammitt 
(2004 ) found that implementation of NHI in Taiwan significantly increased the 
probability of technology adoption, ownership, and the use of technologies by 
private hospitals, after controlling for hospital characteristics and market 
competition. 
 Taiwan was the first Asian country to adopt global budgets as a tool for cost 
containment. Using a panel data on outpatient dental care,  Lee and Jones (2004)  
reported that the implementation of global budgets in Taiwan had three major 
effects. First, the introduction of global budgets decreased dental care utilization 
and hence reduced the growth rate of outpatient dental care expenditures. Second, 
by providing relatively favorable funding for dental care in deprived areas, global 
budgets had a weak effect on improving the distribution of dental care and dentist 
supply. Third, global budgets changed the labor supply of dentists. Overall, den-
tists ’ labor supply decreases following the implementation of global budgets. 
However, the dentists altered the mix of their services toward high-charge 
services. 
 As noted above, there is a risk that the public provision of health insurance 
coverage may crowd out private saving. One motivation for personal saving is 
precautionary, which is to reserve funds for a  “ rainy day, ” which the occurrence 
of an illness represents. 
 Chou, Liu, and Hammitt (2003 ) studied the effect of introducing universal 
health insurance coverage in Taiwan in 1995 on precautionary saving. In conduct-
ing this study, the authors took advantage of (1) the major exogenous change to 
households in health insurance coverage, (2) the fact that many Taiwanese had 
government-provided health insurance coverage before the introduction of 
universal health insurance coverage in 1995, and (3) the availability of household 
consumption data for a sufficiently long time period. The authors found that 
compared to the preceding government insurance program, the introduction of 
universal health insurance coverage in Taiwan resulted in a decrease in personal 
savings by 8.6 – 13.7 percent, with the largest effects being seen among households 
with the least personal saving. Recall that  Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes 
(1995)  concluded that a means-tested public insurance program reduced savings 
rates. In Taiwan, the program is not means tested. Nevertheless, the impact has 
been larger for households at the bottom than for those at the top of the wealth 
distribution. 
 Should we regard reductions in personal saving as a positive or negative 
development? Certainly for risk-averse individuals, reductions in out-of-pocket 
expenditure risk are welfare-enhancing. People would clearly prefer a situation in 
which public insurance is provided and they have less motivation to engage in 
precautionary saving. They may even prefer this if made to pay higher taxes for 
the risk reduction. 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 545
 But there is another concern. Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing typically 
accompanies public financing. With PAYGO financing, current taxpayers pay for 
current benefits. To the extent that real program benefits are increasing, there is an 
intergenerational transfer from younger persons, who tend to be low utilizers of 
personal health care services, to older persons, who tend to be relatively high 
utilizers. An alternative is a fully funded insurance system. Under the latter, when 
a person is added to the insurance rolls, the insurer computes the present value of 
benefit flows and develops a schedule of premiums that has a present value equal 
to the present value of benefit flows. Full funding eliminates intergenerational 
transfers. While income-based transfers may reflect a country ’ s social welfare func-
tion, intergenerational transfers may take place for reasons of political expediency 
rather than reflect underlying societal preferences. 
 12.7 
 The Public Health Insurance Program in 
Rural China 
 Background 
 Beginning in 2003, China introduced a new health insurance program, the New 
Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), in rural areas. By 2007 this program had a 
total of 730 million participants. Thus, NCMS is the world ’ s largest public insur-
ance program, gauged in terms of number of enrollees. The NCMS has three major 
characteristics. 
 First, participation in the NCMS is voluntary — the opposite of the compulsory 
universal programs adopted in other countries. The government uses a subsidized 
flat-rate contribution to encourage informal sector workers and their families to 
enroll. In 2006, the mean premium (budget) per insured population was about 52 
RMB; insured members paid only 28 percent of the premium, and central and local 
governments paid the rest. On average, central government bore 30 percent of the 
government subsidy while local governments bore the rest ( Lei and Lin 2009 ). 
 Second, the focus of the NCMS is on coverage for catastrophic illness. Thus, 
the system has been designed to provide lower coverage and higher cost sharing —
 the opposite of the comprehensive benefit plans adopted in high-income countries. 
Most coverage is for hospital inpatient care. Outpatient care is not covered or is 
covered only partially, with high deductibles and high coinsurance rates. 
 Third, the NCMS operates at the county level, and local governments have 
considerable discretion in the design of their NCMS programs. Hence, there is 
considerable heterogeneity in benefit packages among counties. Specifically, reim-
bursement in the NCMS is of four types (  table 12.4 ).  
 The first only provides public coverage for inpatient care, with a very high 
coinsurance rate, ranging from 59 to 66 percent ( Wagstaff, Lindelow, Jun, et al. 

546 
 Part III / Chapter 12
2009 ). Outpatient services are not covered. Only 16.9 percent of counties with the 
NCMS fit in this category. 
 The second type covers inpatient and outpatient expenses for catastrophic 
diseases with high deductibles and coinsurance rates, a model in use by 11.2 
percent of counties with the NCMS. The third covers inpatient expenses as well 
as outpatient expenses on a pooled basis, an approach used by 6.7 percent of 
counties. 
 The fourth and most popular model, used in nearly two-thirds of counties, 
provides hospital inpatient coverage through insurance funds and coverage for 
outpatient services through a medical savings account (MSA), an approach adopted 
from Singapore. Each household has its own MSA accounts that accumulate funds 
from household members ’ contributions. Such MSA accounts are earmarked for 
outpatient services only. 
 In sum, all NCMS models cover hospital inpatient services. The bulk of 
NCMS reimbursement, from about 66 percent to 100 percent, is for such expense 
( Wagstaff, Lindelow, Jun, et al. 2009 ). 
 Effects of the NCMS 
 As in other countries, the major policy objectives of the NCMS are to reduce finan-
cial burdens on individual patients, increase access to personal health care ser-
vices, and improve population health. Given that the NCMS is the newest health

plan discussed in this chapter, empirical evidence on the effects of the NCMS is 
very limited. However, the following three studies reveal a clear picture of the 
effectiveness of the NCMS. 
 Lei and Lin (2009 ) used longitudinal survey data to assess the impact of the 
NCMS with several state-of-the-art econometric methods. Based on their empirical 
research, they concluded that implementation of the NCMS did not reduce out-of-
pocket expenditure. Similarly, the NCMS did not increase utilization of formal 
medical services and did not improve health outcomes, as measured by self-
reported health status and by sickness and injury reports for the four weeks before 
the interviews were conducted. By contrast, they found that NCMS enrollees were 
less likely to visit traditional Chinese folk physicians and were more likely to use 
preventive care than were others. Using a similar econometric method but different 
data,  Wagstaff, Lindelow, and Jun (2009 ) found that implementation of the NCMS 
led to increased outpatient and inpatient utilization, results inconsistent with  Lei 
and Lin ’ s (2009 ) results. However,  Wagstaff, Lindelow, and Jun (2009 ) confirmed 
 Lei and Lin ’ s (2009 ) finding that NCMS did not reduce out-of-pocket expenses for 
both outpatient and inpatient services. In another study,  Wagstaff and Lindelow 
(2008)  used data including both the urban and the rural population. They found 
that the implementation of NCMS increased the risk of incurring high and cata-
strophic health expenditures.  2 
 A common finding of these three studies is that the implementation of NCMS 
and other public health insurance programs in China did not significantly reduce 
out-of-pocket payments by individual patients. This result is counter to the usual 
theory that insurance should reduce households ’ financial risk (see chapter 4). 
 There are two plausible explanations for this paradox. First, an explanation 
from the demand side is that the program ’ s per capita budget has been too small 
for there to be a substantial reduction in households ’ out-of-pocket payments. The 
NCMS paid only 52 RMB per insured individuals in 2006 — only 20 percent of total 
rural health care spending per capita population. Given the low level of per capita 
payments, the NCMS must impose high rates of patient cost sharing, and low 
payment ceilings for providers. In addition, many services, especially outpatient 
services, are not covered by this public program. In implementing the NCMS with 
a low budget, the Chinese government faced a tough trade-off between the amount 
it could spend per insured person and the number of persons who were covered. 
 This trade-off is illustrated by the budget line shown in   figure 12.3 . Given 
the fixed budget, the government can implement a public insurance program to 
cover the entire population but with very low benefits per covered person, such 
as at point  B . Or the government could implement a program with relatively gener-
ous benefits, one with zero cost sharing and broad coverage of services, for a very 
small population group, such as at point  A . Besides these two extreme cases, there 
are many possible combinations of number of insured persons (quantity) and the 
generosity of insurance coverage (price). Thus, line  AB  represents the public health 
2.  In this study, 
 Wagstaff and Lindelow 
(2008)  defined annual 
health spending as 
 “ high ”  if it exceeded a 
threshold of local 
average income and as 
 “ catastrophic ” if it 
exceeded a threshold of 
the household ’ s own 
per capita income.

insurance program ’ s budget line, depicting the public policy maker ’ s trade-off 
between quantity (number of insured persons) and price (generosity of insurance 
coverage).  
 The program design actually selected by the policy makers is at the point 
of tangency of the budget line and the policy maker ’ s indifference curve, such 
as at point  E 1 . The indifference curve shows combinations of quantity and price 
that yield the same utility level to the policy maker, such as  I 1 and  I 2 . Apparently, 
policy makers in China value quantity more than price.  3 Thus, the indifference 
curve is rather flat. Given that the marginal utility of covering more persons tends 
to be high relative to the marginal utility of adding to payments per capita of 
covered persons, government payments per capita are low. If the government 
increases the health budget, reflected in a shift of the budget line from  AB  to 
 A ′ B ′ , the new tangency is at  E 2 . Then price (the public insurer ’ s payment per 
insured) increases from  p 1 to  p 2 . As a result, the out-of-pocket payment declines. 
This is the plan announced by the Chinese government in April 2009, to the effect 
that it will spend an additional 850 billion RMB (about equivalent to US$125 
billion) in the next three years, indicating that line  E 1 E 2 is the future reform path 
of the NCMS.

3.  The term  “ price ” 
here refers to benefits 
per insured person. 
Ordinarily, a decision 
maker would not place 
a positive valuation on 
price. But here, price 
stands for generosity of 
the health insurance 
benefit.

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 549
 The second explanation for the lack of effect of the NCMS in reducing out-
of-pocket spending is from the supply side. More than 70 percent of counties 
implementing the NCMS have adopted fee-for-service payment ( Wagstaff, Linde-
low, Jun, et al. 2009 ). The government has set fee schedules in a way that gives 
basic services a low price-cost margin and higher price-cost margin on prescription 
drugs and high-technology services. The NCMS and other public health insurance 
programs in China thus give physicians an incentive to prescribe more drugs and 
use more high-tech services. Implementation of the NCMS has increased ownership 
of expensive equipment in central township health centers ( Wagstaff, Lindelow, 
Jun, et al. 2009 ). In addition, between 1990 and 2005, 45 – 50 percent of the national 
health expenditure in China was allocated to drugs, compared with an OECD 
average of 15 percent ( Huang and Yang 2009 ). 
 All these supply-side responses imply that the NCMS and other public health 
insurance programs in China may encourage people to seek more expensive care 
when sick than they otherwise would, such as seeking care from higher-level pro-
viders ( Wagstaff and Lindelow 2008 ). The increase in unit prices of care, in com-
bination with the increase in the quantity of services induced by insurance, may 
account for the increased levels of out-of-pocket payments. This result is consistent 
with the conceptual framework illustrated in figure 11.2 and  Finkelstein ’ s (2007)  
evidence to the effect that the expansion of health insurance can lead to a substan-
tial increase in health expenditures, especially in view of suppliers ’ responses to 
the expansion of coverage. 
 12.8 
 Discussion and Conclusions 
 This chapter has analyzed the economic rationale for the public provision of health 
insurance and the evolution of such systems in several countries, including 
Germany, the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China. We 
first discussed the advantages of the public provision of health insurance, includ-
ing benefits from achieving universal coverage, efficiency gains from lower admin-
istrative costs and lower enforcement cost of regulation, enhanced bargaining 
power of public payers, and cross subsidies from healthy to sick individuals. 
However, countries that gain these advantages also incur an opportunity cost in 
the sense that they must give up several advantages of the private provision of 
health insurance. For example, the public provision of health insurance is less 
efficient than private provision in satisfying the wants of consumers with hetero-
geneous preferences. In addition, public payers may exercise monopsony power, 
with one adverse consequence being reduced incentives for innovation. In sum, 
neither public provision nor private provision of health insurance is clearly 
preferable. 

550 
 Part III / Chapter 12
 We then analyzed the evolution of health care systems in several countries 
that have adopted the public provision of health insurance. In the United States, 
the public provision of health insurance has primarily focused on elderly persons 
and the poor. In Germany, the system is not mandatory for the relatively affluent, 
but applies to 90 percent of the population whose income is less than a statutory 
threshold. In other countries, including Canada, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, 
the coverage of public health insurance reaches the entire population. The services 
that are covered by public health insurance vary among countries. Some countries 
provide comprehensive insurance coverage, such as Canada, Japan, and Taiwan, 
while others provide more limited coverage, such as South Korea and China. 
Almost every country faced a rapid increase in health care costs after achieving 
the goal of  “ universal coverage ” ( Cutler 2002 ). In response, countries adopting 
government financing and private supply have substantially relied on public cost-
containment policies to control the growth of their health expenditures. On the 
demand side, all seven countries discussed in this chapter have implemented 
various forms of cost sharing to control moral hazard. On the supply side, countries 
have adopted several payment system reforms to change the incentives of health 
care providers. 
 We have reviewed many studies investigating the effect of universal coverage 
and payment system reforms. Overall, universal coverage has had large impacts 
not only on demand, as reflected in increased health care utilization and expendi-
tures, but also on supply, as reflected in the entry of new hospitals and technologi-
cal change in health care, especially in larger countries, for which the increase in 
coverage has had a major effect on the pharmaceutical medical device market as 
well as the equipment (e.g., imaging) market size. In addition, empirical studies of 
payment system reforms consistently find that incentive matters in guiding provid-
ers ’ choices on quantity and quality. For example, the US Medicare ’ s PPS substan-
tially reduced lengths of hospital inpatient stays but did not adversely affect patient 
outcomes. Similarly, the introduction of global budgets in Taiwan substantially 
reduced the quantity of services provided by the dentists, thus lowering the growth 
rate of health care expenditures overall. 
 Although countries differ in their evolution and in the structure of their 
payment systems, the experiences of individual payment system reforms may 
offer valuable lessons for other countries. For example, as a pioneer, the United 
States experienced a high growth in health care expenditures following the imple-
mentation of Medicare in 1966. By contrast, as an imitator, Taiwan faced only a 
moderate increase in health care expenditures after the establishment of universal 
coverage in 1995. This suggests that imitator countries enjoy an advantage in being 
able to learn from the experiences of their predecessors. Similarly, South Korea 
and Taiwan learned lessons from the US PPS for the design of their own payment 
systems. 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 551
 The recent experience in China — the adoption of a major public health insur-
ance program may not substantially reduce out-of-pocket payments by individu-
als — highlights the importance of doing more than just assuming that this type of 
intervention will transform the system, making it both more efficient and more 
effective. Governments in China and several other middle-income countries 
have committed to increasing public funds for personal health care services. 
Whether or not such additional resources injected into health care can be effective 
in transforming the system by improving financial access to health care, or alter-
natively might just be captured by providers in the form higher fees, incomes, and 
profits, depends on payment system design. How this will play out is an open 
question.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 12.1  
 What is meant by the term  “ social insurance ” ? How does it compare with 
other forms of public insurance? 
 12.2  
 Suppose you were asked by a policy maker in a low-income country to list 
the pros and cons of public provision of health insurance. The policy maker 
is busy and would like to see a short summary with no more than three 
points on each side. Which three advantages and disadvantages of the public 
provision of health insurance would you list? Justify each point you list. 
 12.3  
 Distinguish between treatment substitution effects and treatment expansion 
effects of new medical technologies. Give examples of new technologies that 
in important ways provide each. 

552 
 Part III / Chapter 12
 12.4 
 What are key differences between Medicare and Medicaid in the United 
States? 
 12.5 
 What does it mean to say that public health insurance  “ crowds out ” private 
health insurance? If this is so, why does the government still want to provide 
health insurance on its own? 
 12.6 
 Explain the term  “ means-tested public insurance ” in your own words. If the 
government expands the eligibility of this public program, do you expect 
this policy to have any effect on labor force participation in a country? Is 
there any evidence to support your expectation? 
 12.7 
 Which criteria can be used to determine the benefit structure of public 
health insurance plans? By benefit structure, we mean the preventive, diag-
nostic, and therapeutic procedures covered by the health insurance plan. 
 12.8 
 What is meant by a  “ contribution percentage, ” as in the German statutory 
health insurance system? Does a fixed contribution percentage (one not 
dependent on earnings) mean that the plan is regressive? Why or why not? 
How would you determine whether the plan is regressive? Be sure to indi-
cate what is meant by the term  “ regressive. ” 
 12.9 
 The US Medicare program offers an HMO option for its beneficiaries. What 
are the characteristics of beneficiaries who would be likely to select the 
HMO versus fee-for-service Medicare? Justify your answer. 
 12.10  Conceptually, how does paying hospitals a fixed prospective amount per 
patient admission affect hospital behavior? How does prospective payment 
differ from retrospective payment of hospitals? 
 12.11  Describe the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS). What are alter-
native methods that a public insurer could use to set the fees it pays? Evalu-
ate the pros and cons of each alternative that you list. 
 12.12  Describe the concept of  “ spending down ” to Medicaid. What is the likely 
effect of offering a means-tested health insurance program such as Medicaid 
on the private precautionary saving of individuals? What is meant by  “ pre-
cautionary ” saving? 
 12.13  Canada employs global operating budgets and controls over capital expen-
ditures. What is a global operating budget? How is the use of a global operat-
ing budget likely to affect the behavior of individual hospitals? 
 12.14  Public health insurance programs often require eligible individuals to enroll 
in such plans. What is the rationale for mandating public insurance 
coverage? 
 12.15  Economists distinguish between price and non-price rationing. What is 
meant by non-price rationing? Economists have often argued that non-price 

Government Financing and Private Supply 
 553
rationing entails a  “ deadweight loss. ” What is meant by this term? Are there 
valid economic arguments for non-price rationing? 
 12.16   In Japan and some other East Asian countries, physicians dispense drugs 
directly to their patients. What do you see as the advantages and disadvan-
tages of this arrangement? 
 12.17   What is meant by pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing? What is the alternative 
to PAYGO? What are some disadvantages of PAYGO? What then explains its 
popularity? Identify a public program in your country that is funded on a 
PAYGO basis. 
 12.18   Based on the empirical evidence reviewed in this chapter, list the social 
benefits and costs of the US Medicaid program. 
 12.19   Explain the distinction between social insurance and means-tested public 
insurance. Do these two types of health insurance programs affect saving 
behavior in the same way? Is there any evidence to support your answer? 
 12.20   Explain the distinction between  “ compulsory ” social insurance and  “ volun-
tary ” social insurance. Do these two types of health insurance program affect 
health expenditure in the same way? Why have most countries included in 
this chapter adopted compulsory social insurance while only a few coun-
tries, such as China, have adopted voluntary social insurance? 
 Exercises 
 12.1   Define  “ retrospective cost-based reimbursement system ” and  “ prospective 
payment system. ” Suppose you were asked by a policy maker to design the 
payment system for a public insurance program. If the policy maker would like to 
use the payment system to achieve the goal of cost containment, which payment 
system you would recommend? If the policy maker changes the goal of policy and 
would like to focus on increasing the quality of health care, would you change 
your recommendation for the design of the payment system? Justify your 
recommendation. 
 12.2   In the United States, the real treatment cost (in 2000 dollars) per case for 
depression decreased from US$2,012 in 1987 to US$1,073 in 1996. However, total 
real costs for treating depression increased from US$4.83 billion to US$9.22 billion 
during the same period. Use the concept of treatment substitution and treatment 
expansion to explain why the mean treatment cost decreased but the total treatment 
cost increased. 

554 
 Part III / Chapter 12
 12.3  Suppose country A traditionally relies on out-of-pocket costs to finance 
personal health care services. Assume this country receives a substantial amount 
of foreign aid for its many infrastructure investments, hence the government can 
release public funds to finance personal health care services. Suppose the govern-
ment decides to introduce an additional system of universal coverage through a 
single-payer program. Conceptually, what effect do you expect the introduction of 
universal coverage to have on the demand and supply sides of the country ’ s health 
care market? List at least two impacts on both sides of the health care market in 
country A. Justify each effect you list. 
 12.4  In the early 1970s, only a few health insurance plans provided coverage for 
prescription drugs. Many health insurance programs have added coverage for pre-
scription drugs in more recent years. For example, in the United States, less than 20 
percent of spending on prescription drugs was covered by health insurance in 1970. 
This share increased to near three-quarters by 1998. What factors account for this? 
 12.5  Finkelstein (2007)  reported that implementation of the Medicare program in 
the United States led to a 37 percent increase in real hospital expenditures between 
1965 and 1970. However, based on estimates from the  RAND  HIE study (see chapter 
3), the implementation of Medicare increased real hospital expenditures by only 
5.6 percent. Explain the differences between these two estimates. 
 12.6  Use the concept of cost of capital (COC) and marginal efficiency of invest-
ment (MEI) introduced in chapters 2 and 9 to analyze the effect of implementing 
the Medicare program on hospitals ’ investment in new technology. Will the imple-
mentation of Medicare program affect COC or MEI for hospital investment in new 
technology? Justify your answer. 
 12.7  Use three graphs to show the effect of Medicaid fees on the physician ’ s 
incentive to accept Medicaid patients. Graph A is a horizontal line that represents 
the demand curve for Medicaid patients. Graph B is a downward-sloping curve 
that represents the demand curve for non-Medicaid patients. Graph C represents 
the sum of demand from the two separate markets. Assume that the physician ’ s 
marginal cost curve has a positive slope. Show: 
 a.  How will the physician set the price for non-Medicaid patient if the physician 
pursues maximum profit? 
 b.  Under what conditions will the physician not accept Medicaid patients? Show 
graphically. 
 c.  Will the physician be more likely to accept Medicaid patients if the government 
increases the Medicaid fees paid to the physician? Show the effect of an increased 
Medicaid fee graphically.

 12.8   Prepare a table to compare social insurance programs in Canada, China, 
Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States for the following 
dimensions: 
 a.  beneficiary eligibility; 
 b.  sources of public financing; 
 c.  payment methods; 
 d.   type and extent of cost sharing. 
 12.9   Assume a country ’ s health care expenditures (HCE) are financed from two 
sources: (1) public expenditures (PE) and (2) out-of-pocket payments (OOP). Thus, 
HCE = PE + OOP. Given the following relationships: (PE/HCE) + (OOP/HCE) = 1 
and HCE/GDP = PE/GDP + OOP/GDP, where GDP represents the gross domestic 
product. Suppose this country currently spends 5 percent of GDP on personal 
health care and services, and out-of-pocket payments account for 60 percent of the 
country ’ s total health care expenditures. Use the above-mentioned information and 
relationships to answer the following questions: 
 a.  If the government increases funding for personal health care services by adding 
1 percent of GDP to health care, and assuming that other things remain constant, 
that is, the share of GDP spent on health care (HCE/GDP) remains unchanged, 
will this policy reduce the share of out-of-pocket payments on health care 
expenditure (OOP/HCE)? Calculate the new values of OOP/HCE under this 
scenario. 
 b.  If the new funds injected into the health care sector lead providers to raise fees, 
with the result that HCE/GDP increases from 5 percent to 6 percent, will this 
policy reduce the share of out-of-pocket payments in the health care expendi-
ture? Calculate the new value of OOP/HCE under this scenario. 
 c.  If the new funds injected into a health care system induce a high rate of health 
care inflation caused by increased wasteful health care spending, with the result 
that HCE/GDP increases from five percent to 10 percent, will this policy reduce 
the share of out-of-pocket payments in total health care expenditures? Calculate 
the new value of OOP/HCE under this scenario. 
 d.   Based on the scenarios in parts (a) to (c) of this question, explain how a govern-
ment could use the new funds to promote effective and efficient health care 
provision so that the new public sector funds lead to a reduction in the share 
of out-of-pocket payments in total health care expenditures. Under what condi-
tions would the government fail to achieve this policy goal, with the new funds 
being captured by providers in the form of higher income and profits? 

556

 12.10  In 2005, China spent about half its health care expenditures on pharmaceu-
tical products, while this share was only about 12 percent in the United States. 
What factors account for this large difference?

 Public Supply and Financing 
 Many countries have neither private financing nor social insurance. Rather, there 
is direct provision of health care services through public clinics and hospitals. This 
system is found in some high-income countries, including the United Kingdom, 
Denmark, Norway, Australia, and New Zealand, and it predominates (or has pre-
dominated) in some developing countries, such as China in the period immediately 
following the communist revolution (see chapter 11). 
 An overriding question concerns the rationale for such systems. Since our 
subject is health economics, our particular focus is on the economic rationale for 
such systems. Further, we want to know how direct provision and financing com-
pares with the other systems described in the two previous chapters, in terms of 
both efficiency and equity. 
 In these public delivery systems, governments play particularly important 
roles in resource allocation in the health sector, and face certain issues. First, how 
much money should be allocated to health care in the aggregate? Second, how 
should these resources be allocated geographically — by demographic group, such 
as provision for children or the elderly, or by type of care, such as preventive, 
curative, or palliative care? (Palliative care is designed to relieve pain and suffering 
among persons with a low life expectancy.) Third, how should providers, such as 
physicians, be paid? This becomes an issue when care is provided by public orga-
nizations. Otherwise, such decisions are left to the private sector. Fourth, should 
private supplementation of government payment for personal health care services 
be permitted, and if so, under what circumstances should such supplementation 
be permitted or encouraged? 

564 
 Part III / Chapter 13
 This chapter first discusses the rationale for public provision. We then inves-
tigate public provision in practice, including the National Health Service in the 
United Kingdom and Australia. We also present the theoretical rationale and 
empirical evidence on rationing of health care services by queues, or non-price 
rationing, rather than rationing by price. Since many low-income countries rely on 
the public provision of personal health care services, we provide an overview of 
the evidence on the performance of public provision of these services in such 
countries. Finally, we evaluate and compare health systems with different supply 
and financing arrangements as a conclusion to Part III. 
 13.1 
 The Rationale for Public Provision of Health 
Care 
 The Role of Transaction Costs 
 Under public provision, major providers of health care, such as hospitals, are 
owned and operated by the government. Governments worldwide face a choice 
that they make actively or passively just as a matter of historical fact: when should 
a government provide health care services directly or  “ in-house, ”  and when should 
health care services be provided privately by contract or some other arrangement? 
Even if the system is public by accident of history, the question of whether or not 
historical arrangements should be retained or an alternative system selected is a 
highly relevant and important one. Further, an alternative is to retain public provi-
sion but allow private provision as well, or institute cost sharing as a financing 
mechanism to supplement tax-based financing. 
 A lesson from economics is that a country ’ s choice of ownership form should 
reflect the relative transaction costs of different forms of ownership. Transaction 
costs are administrative costs incurred to achieve societal objectives. For example, 
if the objective is to avoid corruption and ensure that funds are used for their 
intended purposes, what is the relative cost of achieving this objective when health 
facilities are under different forms of ownership? Transaction costs are also involved 
when governments institute various forms of regulatory oversight to ensure that 
protections are consistent in the societal objectives, such as the provision of care 
to disadvantaged populations. 
 In some areas, market size is insufficient to support more than one firm. 
Governments often regulate the prices of such  “ natural monopolists ” ( Breyer 1982 ; 
 Joskow 2007 ). However, it may be more costly for a government to regulate a private 
seller than to own the firm and provide output directly. If the objective is to 
promote innovation, what is the administrative cost of structuring adequate incen-
tives under different ownership forms? For example, by owning the firm, the 
government would gain insider knowledge about company operations. 

Public Supply and Financing 
 565
 If an important social objective is to promote access to care, how do the 
alternative ownership forms compare in terms of the resources needed to accom-
plish this objective? Perhaps it is easier to be sure that the facilities actually are 
located in geographically remote areas of a country if they are publicly owned and 
operated. In countries with a high proportion of illiterate or otherwise not well-
educated persons, direct public provision may be more efficient than private provi-
sion financed by private or public insurance, in part because public provision of 
care tends to eliminate the paperwork required for obtaining reimbursement. 
 By contrast, providing incentives to promote innovation may be more diffi-
cult under public than under private ownership. There may be important trade-offs, 
with some ownership forms being more efficient in achieving some objectives and 
other forms being more efficient in achieving other objectives. In the end, public 
policy makers need to weigh the relative important of various, sometimes conflict-
ing, objectives. 
 Further, some forms may be more efficient than others when there are non-
contractible outputs. Achieving socially desirable outcomes when there are non-
contractible outputs may require greater resource allocations for monitoring with 
some ownership forms than with others. When consumers are unable to adequately 
gauge some aspects of quality of care, there is concern that for-profit hospitals may 
require greater external scrutiny than other organizational forms. Achieving an 
adequate supply of facilities in geographically remote areas of a country may be 
easier if the facilities are government-owned and can be placed in such areas by 
the government than if the government must provide incentives for private orga-
nizations to locate there. 
 Noncontractible Outcomes Revisited 
 The choice of public versus private provision is an old question in economics, but 
the answers economists give, as well as the rationale for their answers, have 
changed somewhat over time. Traditionally, economists and many others have 
often favored the for-profit organizational form over government-owned and gov-
ernment-operated facilities on the grounds of relative efficiency. Because for-profit 
organizations have well-defined residual claimants, the shareholders, a dollar 
realized in savings from greater efficiency is an added dollar that goes to 
shareholders. 
 By contrast, when government is the owner of an enterprise, the residual 
claimant is not as well defined. Millions of citizens are taxpayers, and the return 
from savings from efficiency gains to individual taxpayers is so small as to go 
unnoticed and insufficient to activate the individual citizen/voter/taxpayer to 
devote personal resources to ferret out inefficiency. 
 Or the enterprise may serve the objectives of politicians rather than maximize 
efficiency, which would yield higher returns to shareholders if the enterprise were 
privately owned. One key objective of politicians is employment since employed

persons represent major voting blocks (see, e.g.,  Boycko, Shleifer, and Vishny 1996 ). 
One reason why public enterprises may be inefficient is that they often institute 
work rules and protect seniority to a greater extent than can be justified on effi-
ciency grounds. Happy and content workers may be more industrious, but only up 
to a point. The notion that for-profit enterprises are more efficient than public 
enterprises has had a broad following among economists and others more generally. 
There is some empirical support for this view (see, e.g.,  Peltzman 1971 ;  Megginson 
and Netter 2001 ). 
 The fall of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, 
which led to large-scale privatization of public enterprises, has provided many 
natural experiments for empirical assessments of the relative efficiency of private 
and public enterprises. These natural experiments have the advantage of offering 
the possibility of pre- versus post-conversion to for-profit status comparisons of 
efficiency changes. The evidence from these studies is nuanced. There is no overall 
conclusion. Rather, relative efficiency depends on important details. 
 Frydman, Gray, Hessel, et al. (1999) , who studied the privatization of enter-
prises in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, found that privatization 
to outsider owners but not to insiders led to improvements in the enterprises ’ 
performance — more so in terms of revenue enhancement than in terms of cost 
reduction. Insiders, as owners, are likely to pursue other objectives, such as employ-
ment maintenance, which does not generally lead to higher efficiency and profit-
ability. Frydman and coauthors ’ finding of no effect of privatization on efficiency 
but an improvement in revenue generation is supported by a comparison of 
private not-for-profit and public hospitals in Uganda.  Ssengooba, Atuyambe, 
McPake, et al. (2002)  found no clear differences in efficiency between the two 
ownership types, but private not-for-profit hospitals were more successful in gen-
erating revenue. 
 In addition, legal protections for investors in enterprises are important factors 
in ensuring that company managers have a clear incentive to serve outside owners, 
and the strength of such legal protections varies appreciably among countries 
( Shleifer and Vishny 1997 ). The impact of privatization on efficiency seems to be 
greater when the product market in which the establishment is being privatized is 
competitive. 
 The case for privatization is less compelling in markets for public goods and 
when natural monopolies are involved ( Megginson and Netter 2001 , 329 – 330). 
Proponents of government ownership point to imperfections in markets and argue 
that in some sectors, firms should seek other objectives than to maximize profit. 
 Advances in the theories of ownership and contracting have shed new light 
on the question of public versus private supply. From the perspective of contract-
ing, there is, at least in principle, no difference between public and private provi-
sion of goods and services if a public official can sign a complete contract with 
public employees or a private supplier. Such a complete contract specifies key 

Public Supply and Financing 
 567
attributes of the quality of services to be delivered by the public agency or private 
supplier. However, in the context of health care, it is likely to be impossible to 
specify all pertinent attributes in a contract with a private supplier. The govern-
ment agency cannot fully anticipate, describe, stipulate, regulate, and enforce 
exactly what it wants in advance ( Shleifer 1998 ). Health care quality is difficult to 
specify in advance because so many contingencies are involved. For example, given 
heterogeneity among patients, such as differences in illness severity, providers 
should optimally devote varying amounts of time and effort to their care. Yet as a 
practical matter, it is impossible to develop a sufficiently detailed payment formula 
that could adequately account for such variation in time and effort. As a result, a 
profit-seeking organization may not be inclined to care for complex cases for which 
payment is judged to be inadequate. 
 When contracts are incomplete in that important attributes of output cannot 
be fully specified by contract, the provider ’ s ownership form matters a great deal 
because private ownership and public ownership are fundamentally different in 
the allocation of residual control rights, which in turn affects suppliers ’ incentives 
for cost reduction and quality improvement ( Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny 1997 ). We 
employ Hart and coauthors ’ framework to explain how ownership form affects 
incentives for innovation and under which conditions public provision is superior 
to private supply. 
 At the risk of oversimplication, but to highlight some analytic points, assume 
that a provider of services can engage in two types of innovation: one is innovation 
to improve quality of care, the other is innovation to reduce cost. Neither type of 
innovation is contractible ex ante. Although the government and the provider can 
specify some attributes of output in advance, many contingencies are difficult to 
anticipate and cast in sufficiently detailed contract terms. In particular, a cost 
reduction may increase profit but may not be easily monitored by consumers or 
public policy makers. 
 Specifically, private suppliers, especially when organized as for-profit orga-
nizations, have residual control rights over the asset, and hence have an incentive 
to adopt innovations that cut cost. Also, their incentive to engage in cost reduction 
is strong because they ignore the adverse effects of cost reductions on noncontract-
ible quality. In contrast, the suppliers ’ incentive to engage in quality improvement 
is not as strong as is the incentive for cost reduction because they must renegotiate 
with the government for a higher price if they want to improve quality. As a con-
sequence, compared to the efficient outcome of complete contracting, cost reduc-
tion is inefficiently high and quality improvement efforts are inefficiently low 
under private ownership. 
 By contrast, a manager of a public enterprise must obtain approval from a 
government agency for both quality and cost innovation because he or she does 
not have the residual control rights over the asset. In addition, other public employ-
ees can replace the person to whom the public supplier reports. On the one hand, 

568 
 Part III / Chapter 13
both of the above two factors weaken incentives for cost reduction and quality 
improvement. On the other hand, public managers have no reason to favor cost 
cutting by reducing quality. 
 Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997)  argue that public provision is most likely 
to be superior to private provision under two circumstances. The first circumstance 
arises when the adverse effect of cost reduction on noncontractible quality is suf-
ficiently large as to fully offset the value of cost savings achievable under private 
ownership. If so, public provision is socially efficient because it provides weak 
incentives for cost reduction. In the second circumstance, ongoing innovation is 
not a major contributor to quality improvement or public employees do not have 
weaker incentives to make innovations that improve quality. In either case, public 
provision may be preferred. 
 The above conclusion is based on a framework in which incomplete con-
tracts predominate, and whether or not incomplete contracts have the conse-
quences predicted by the Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny framework in a health care 
context is ultimately an empirical question. In health care, gains from quality 
innovation are large (see chapters 9 and 16), but quality can deteriorate if cost is 
reduced. 
 Therefore, neither public nor private provision can be said to be generally 
preferred. This depends on whether or not the government can prevent quality 
deterioration from cost cutting through various efforts, such as by writing suffi-
ciently detailed contracts and/or by effectively regulating and monitoring quality 
of private firms ( Cutler 2002 ). If the government can write a contract that gives the 
private supplier appropriate incentives or penalizes the firm for shirking on quality 
of care, and if the results can be adequately monitored, private provision may be 
superior to public provision. In contrast, if the noncontractible deterioration of 
quality results in substantial welfare loss, public provision may be superior to 
private provision. Whether or not countries are motivated by the reasoning of  Hart, 
Shleifer, and Vishny (1997 ), in fact, in many countries, public provision is the 
dominant delivery approach in the health care sector. 
 The Medicaid program in the US state of California provides an example of 
a public program switching from public control over financing to contracting 
public services out to the private sector. Under the old system, the state Medicaid 
program paid physicians directly on a fee-for-service basis. Although most of the 
physicians practiced in the private sector, the issue we focus on here is the con-
tracting-out feature. The advocates of contracting out argued that private firms are 
more efficient, both in their operations and in offering services that Medicaid 
recipients prefer. Opponents of contracting out contended that private firms lower 
noncontractible quality and avoid unprofitable patients — undesirable behavior that 
is hard to monitor through contracting.  Duggan ’ s (2004)  empirical analysis of this 
change revealed that the switch from fee-for-service to managed care resulted in 
higher government spending but no corresponding improvement in infant health 

Public Supply and Financing 
 569
outcomes. Presumably the cause was not so much the incentives of managed care 
but rather the difficulty Medicaid had in monitoring the decisions of private 
parties. 
 Redistributive Concerns 
 While pure efficiency concerns, that is, that quality-adjusted price will be higher 
under private provision, given noncontractible quality, provide one rationale for 
public provision, redistributive concerns also play an important role in the choice 
between private and public provision. One reason why efficiency and equity are 
related is that some organizational forms may be more efficient in achieving a 
country ’ s equity goals. 
 Because personal health care services are one of the important inputs into 
the production of good health, access to health care, like access to education, has 
been mostly if not universally regarded as a basic right ( Besley and Gouveia 1994 ; 
 Poterba 1996 ;  Hurley 2000 ). The norm of universal access emphasizes that every-
one in society should have the same opportunity to receive at least a certain 
minimal level of health care. This norm is rooted in the concept of  “ specific egali-
tarianism, ” which holds that societies attach special importance to limiting the 
domain of inequality in certain areas, such as health care ( Tobin 1970 ). This view 
implies that access to health care should not be conditioned on the basis of ability 
to pay (e.g., on a person ’ s income). 
 Although equal access to personal health care services is widely regarded as 
an important social objective, there is little agreement among countries as to how 
best to achieve it. However, there is a general consensus that some form of govern-
ment intervention in health care is inevitable because market forces, absent some 
government intervention, are likely to fail to provide even minimally adequate 
levels of care to the poor. Some have argued that altruistic affluent persons can 
voluntarily give to less affluent persons, but this argument is not widely shared 
globally and certainly falls far short of constituting a consensus. 
 Among the possibilities for government interventions are price subsidies, 
public mandates for private provision, and direct government provision. Compared 
to price subsidies and mandates, public provision has the advantage that it gives 
government greater control over the nature of the services individuals receive 
( Poterba 1996 ). 
 Usher (1977)  developed the notion of  “ socialization of commodities ” to 
explain why public provision is chosen as an instrument to achieve the norm of 
universal access. He defined socialization as a process in which the government 
appropriates the entire supply of a commodity, such as health care services, and 
then redistributes that commodity among all of its citizens, equally or according 
to nonpecuniary criteria. His model assumes the following: (1) the principal motive 
for socialization is to reduce income inequality; (2) whether or not a commod-
ity is socialized or not is made by majority rule; and (3) the government uses 

570 
 Part III / Chapter 13
proportional or progressive income taxation to finance the socialization of a com-
modity. In this framework, the poorer half of the community receives a net gain 
from socialization because it pays less in taxes than the per capita cost of govern-
ment acquisition of the socialized commodity. In contrast, affluent individuals are 
the losers because they pay more in taxes than they benefit from socialization. 
However, the gainers can outvote the losers in a society in which the distribution 
of income is highly unequal in favor of the rich. 
 Usher ’ s model yields the prediction that a commodity is more likely to be 
socialized in a community with a greater degree of income inequality and less 
diversity in individuals ’ tastes for the commodity. The level of public provision is 
set at the level favored by the median voter. Furthermore, the level of public provi-
sion depends on the structure of the tax system because the structure affects the 
tax price of public provision. Countries with a more progressive tax structure, such 
as a personal income tax, will be more reliant on public provision. 
 The socialization of commodities through public provision imposes a redis-
tribution of welfare from higher- to lower-income persons because tax payments 
increase with personal income but the benefit received from public provision is 
independent of such income. 
 The public provision of personal health care services redistributes income in 
two ways ( Besley and Gouveia 1994 ). First, there is an implicit income transfer 
from the healthy to the sick. This is because the tax payments used to finance the 
public provision of health care do not depend on the individual ’ s health status, 
except to the extent that poor health reduces earnings, which in turn reduces tax 
payments. By contrast, private health insurance premiums may be experience-rated 
in the sense that higher-morbidity individuals pay more for the same insurance 
policy (see chapter 10). 
 Second, there is an implicit income transfer from affluent to indigent indi-
viduals. Under public provision, the government typically provides personal health 
care services uniformly to all individuals and finances its purchases out of general 
tax revenues. Income is redistributed if tax payments increase with income. Under 
a flat tax regime, the tax rate does not change with income; the rate is set as a fixed 
proportion of earnings or income. But tax payments do vary with earnings or 
income. 
 Although the public provision of health care has several potential advantages, 
including a potential advantage in achieving equal access through income redis-
tribution, one important disadvantage is that it tends to be less responsive than 
private provision in recognizing heterogeneity among individuals. Countries with 
public provision tend to provide relatively uniform personal health care services 
to their citizens. 
 Two types of heterogeneity among individuals may result in a difference 
between public supply and private demand for care. First, people are heteroge-
neous in their personal incomes. More affluent individuals are likely to demand a 

Public Supply and Financing 
 571
higher quality of care than the poor do. Thus, the quality level of government-
supplied personal health care services determined by the median voter may fall 
short of the level of quality demanded by more affluent persons. Second, individu-
als may differ in their risk preferences (see chapter 4). For example, risk-averse 
persons are likely to prefer complete coverage with little or no cost sharing. More 
risk-tolerant individuals would probably rather have more cost sharing for health 
care services and have more resources available for the consumption of other goods 
and services. 
 Individuals with wants that are unmet by the public system may opt out of 
this system if they are unable to consume services simultaneously in both the 
public and the private sectors. The timing of treatment is an important dimension 
of quality of health care. Public systems tend to use waiting time, such as 
waiting time to undergo a surgical procedure, and waiting time in the physician ’ s 
office or clinic before being seen by a physician, as instruments for rationing per-
sonal health care services (see the discussion of waiting periods in Canada in 
chapter 12). 
 In contrast, the private sector can provide treatment more quickly, but at a 
higher out-of-pocket price. Thus, individuals seeking to reduce waiting time may 
choose to opt out the public system and receive care from private sources. In such 
cases, private supply is substituted for public provision. 
 Rather than private supply substituting for public provision, individuals may 
use privately supplied care to complement care received from public sources. In 
this type of situation, individuals increase the quantity of health care they consume 
through purchases from private suppliers. For example, individuals may purchase 
supplemental health insurance to pay for services not covered by the public health 
system (see chapter 12), such as dental care, or to pay the difference between fees 
charged to patients and the regulated price paid by the public sector when provid-
ers can balance a bill. 
 There are pros and cons to allowing private supply to coexist with a system 
of public provision ( Besley and Gouveia 1994 ;  Propper and Green 2001 ). On the 
one hand, opting out of public services that are available at low or no out-of-pocket 
cost in favor of privately provided services that the user must purchase while at 
the same time losing the publicly subsidized service, and supplementation (i.e., 
the use of privately provided services in addition to services available from the 
public sector) may result in a more efficient outcome because individuals who opt 
out or purchase supplemental health insurance are better off and others who do 
not make such choices are not made worse off. This is not a preferred outcome, 
however, if disparities in the use of services themselves generate negative externali-
ties. Some persons may view a two-tier health care option, public provision for 
some and public-private or purely private for others, as inherently unfair. 
 From another perspective, under public provision with a fixed budget (a 
budget that does not strictly depend on the number of persons served), individuals 

572 
 Part III / Chapter 13
remaining in the public sector tend to benefit from the opting out of others because 
opting out increases the per capita resources for those who remain in the public 
system, which in turn helps improve such their access to care in the public sector. 
A less congested system may lead to improvements in quality of care as well. 
 However, the combination of private supply and public provision can have 
several adverse consequences on access and quality of care. First, allowing indi-
viduals to opt out of the public system or to purchase supplemental health insur-
ance creates a multi-tiered health system, which may be widely viewed as 
inequitable. Second, a private sector coexisting with the public one can create 
several negative externalities in respect to the quantity and quality of personal 
health care services provided by the public sector. Physicians employed by the 
public sector may be able to moonlight. They may work for the public clinic in the 
morning and see private patients in the afternoon. Some physicians may refer 
public patients during the hours they work for the public sector to their private 
practices or shirk on quality of care provided to their public patients ( Chaudhury, 
Hammer, Kremer, et al. 2006 ;  Biglaiser and Ma 2007 ). In addition, the private and 
public sectors may compete for scarce resources of health personnel. The public 
sector may be at a disadvantage in such competition, which in turn may lead to 
deterioration in patient access to high-quality personal health care services pro-
vided by a public system. 
 13.2 
 Public Provision in High-Income Countries in 
Practice 
 The United Kingdom ’ s National Health Service 
 Overview 
 Probably the best-known example of the public provision of personal health care 
services is the National Health Services (NHS) of the United Kingdom, which was 
established in 1948. The principal source of finance for the NHS is general tax 
revenues, which accounts for near three-fourths of NHS funds ( Aaron and Schwartz 
2005 ). Earmarked compulsory contributions by individuals and their employers 
are a secondary source of revenue, accounting for 20 percent of NHS funds. User 
charges apply to a limited number of services, such as prescription drugs and 
dental care. Various population groups, such as children, the elderly and disabled, 
and people with low incomes, are exempted from these user charges. User charges 
represent only 2 percent of NHS revenues. The money price of personal health care 
is generally zero at the point of service. 
 Although the NHS provides free care or nearly free care to UK citizens, indi-
viduals are not free to choose their providers. Rather, the government uses the 

Public Supply and Financing 
 573
general practitioner (GP) as a gatekeeper to direct the flow of patients in accessing 
health care. 
 The first decision individuals make is to choose a GP through patient registra-
tion ( Scott and Vick 1999 ). The GP provides all primary care at no charge to the 
patient. Patients cannot switch to other GPs unless they formally switch their reg-
istrations. Nor can they visit a physician for free specialty care unless they obtain 
a referral from their GP. Patients cannot self-refer to an NHS surgeon or hospital. 
Rather, they must be referred by their GP. On seeing a patient, a hospital surgeon 
or consultant may recommend surgery or inpatient treatment, and if such care is 
recommended, the patient is placed on the NHS waiting list. At this stage, the 
patient makes his or her second decision; whether to join the NHS waiting list or 
to opt out the public system and purchase care from a private source ( Martin and 
Smith 1999 ). 
 The NHS is organized by region. Regional health authorities receive funds 
and administer the provision of health services through three distinct government 
channels: (1) primary care physicians (GPs); (2) hospital and other institutional 
care; and (3) nonhospital community care. GPs are government employees and are 
paid on a capitation basis — that is, based on the number of persons enrolled in 
their practices — a fee that covers only the cost of primary care. Most hospitals in 
the UK are public. All specialists are employed on a salaried basis. 
 Rationing by Queues Rather Than by Prices 
 Economics teaches that resources are scarce but wants are unlimited. Thus, some 
form of rationing needed and inevitable for allocating scarce resources. The pejora-
tive term  “ rationing ”  when used in the context of health care has no meaning in 
economics. Rationing will inevitably take place. The only question is how it is to 
be done. 
 Rationing is generally accomplished through the price mechanism. However, 
when price is controlled or there is no market price, non-price rationing devices 
allocate scarce resources. 
 The waiting line and the waiting list constitute two common non-price ration-
ing mechanisms ( Martin and Smith 1999 ). However, the two mechanisms affect 
waiting cost differently. When waiting in line, individuals join a physical queue 
and wait for receipt of a good (e.g., bread, as in wartime) or service (e.g., students 
waiting in tents for tickets to sports events, medical care). With this form of ration-
ing, the time price is the opportunity cost of waiting in line (see chapter 3). 
Although some persons may derive pleasure from waiting in line, in analyzing 
such queuing, economists typically assume that waiting is not pleasurable and 
involves an opportunity cost of time. In contrast, being on a waiting list does not 
require that individuals queue in person. Rather, individuals are placed on a list 
to wait to receive a good or service. 

574 
 Part III / Chapter 13
 Such waiting imposes three types of costs. First, there is a loss of the utility 
of consumption if the value of a good or service to be received declines with time 
( Lindsay and Feigenbaum 1984 ). A surgical procedure may be less effective if 
postponed. Second, since being on a waiting list may prolong time in poorer health 
and may lessen the likelihood of a full recovery, there is a loss in utility for this 
reason as well ( Propper 1995 ). Third, there is the cost of not being as productive 
for a period because of the delay in receipt of care. 
 Waiting in line, or more realistically in this context, waiting in a chair in a 
physician ’ s office or clinic to see a physician, wastes a scarce resource — an indi-
vidual ’ s time. Since there is no social benefit from waiting in line (again assuming 
people do not enjoy being in a queue), only a cost, there is a welfare loss from 
waiting in line. 
 Yet from the standpoint of equity, such rationing by the queue may be advan-
tageous. People with low time prices bear a lower cost of waiting and are less likely 
to drop out of the queue than are more affluent persons. This results in a redistri-
bution of goods and services to the poor. There may be more efficient mechanisms 
for accomplishing this objective, and from society ’ s standpoint, waiting lines 
impose a welfare cost.  
 Nevertheless, the (somewhat) silver lining is that the queue, especially waiting 
time in the physician ’ s office or clinic, tends to redistribute health care use by 
income. Queues reduce relative utilization by the affluent. 
 Waiting lists for appointments or for procedures are probably a more impor-
tant form of non-price rationing than is physical waiting in a physician ’ s office or 
clinic. Specifically, patients with chronic or nonemergency conditions cannot 
obtain inpatient or surgical treatment immediately. Rather, they must join a waiting 
list for hospital admission or elective surgery. Cases in which people wait to be 
seen by an NHS health care provider are well documented. In some cases, people 
either eventually give up waiting or obtain services from private sources. There are 
consequently savings in public budgets. However, despite such savings, whether 
or not the public is better off is questionable because the other costs of waiting 
must be considered. Other countries in which waiting lists are also widely used 
include the Scandinavian countries. 
 Non-price Rationing: Pros and Cons 
 Before examining the empirical evidence from the NHS on waiting lists, we 
discuss some conceptual issues related to such lists. Using waiting lists as a mecha-
nism for resource allocation imposes both social costs and benefits. On the one 
hand, increasing waiting time can reduce pressures on budgets to expand the 
capacity of public health systems. Also, lower-priority services presumably are 
assigned a lower priority in the queue. While patient waits in hospital emergency 
rooms are well publicized, presumably the real emergencies are given highest 

Public Supply and Financing 
 575
priority. On the other hand, increasing waiting time may reduce the benefits 
from treatment as the value of medical treatment often decreases with delay to 
treatment. Therefore, governments with publicly financed and operated health 
systems face a trade-off between increasing treatment benefits for their citizens and 
controlling the size of government health care budgets and being able to prioritize 
persons with respect to their potential benefits from treatment. Of course, prioriti-
zation has a value only if it is done accurately. In the real world, there may be a 
tendency to overstate the need for treatment as a way to gain a higher position in 
the queue. 
 In economics, the standard solution to a policy trade-off, such as the length 
of waiting lists, is to seek an optimal balance between marginal social cost and 
marginal social benefit. Thus, the waiting list issue can be viewed as a decision 
about the optimal timing of medical treatment ( Cullis, Jones, and Propper 2000 ). 
 Figure 13.1  illustrates how a social planner who seeks to maximize societal well-
being decides on the socially optimal length of the waiting list. When we speak of 
social welfare losses from queuing, more precisely only queuing in excess of the 
socially optimal queue length generates a social welfare loss. Some queuing may 
be efficient.  
 The horizontal line represents the length of the waiting list, the number 
of persons on the list. For simplicity, we assume there is a linear relationship 
between the length of time that a person needs to wait to obtain nonemergency 
care and the length of waiting list. The upper part of   figure 13.1  shows the relation-
ship between the length of the waiting list and total health care cost and benefit, 
both expressed in terms of per capita population. The total cost (TC) curve is 
downward sloping and the slope diminishes (in absolute terms) with time to 
service, suggesting that the total cost of providing health care to the representative 
patient decreases with waiting time, and the change in total cost as waiting 
time increases also decreases with waiting time. The total cost of public provision 
under a regime of no waiting time (the intersection of TC and the vertical line) 
exceeds TC with some waiting time. This is so because the government must 
expand the capacity of government health care system, such as increasing 
the number of hospital beds, physicians, nurses, and other health personnel 
employed and other operating costs, such as electricity, if the public system is to 
accommodate all demand immediately. If the government does not accommodate 
all demand, the total cost of public provision may be expected to be proportionately 
lower. 
 Thus, the benefit of increasing waiting time is the reduction in total cost of 
public provision as the length of the waiting list increases. Geometrically, marginal 
benefit is the slope of the TC curve. Since the slope of the TC curve decreases with 
the number of persons on the waiting list, the marginal benefit of using the waiting 
list as a rationing device also decreases with the length of the list, as seen in the 
lower part of   figure 13.1 .

 Similarly, the total benefit (TB) curve shows the relationship between the 
total benefit received from treatment and waiting list length. The slope of the TB 
curve is also negative, suggesting that treatment benefit is higher if delay to treat-
ment is shorter. The change in treatment benefit with respect to waiting time to 
treatment is a rate of decay, which indicates a loss in treatment benefit as people 
wait longer for such care. This rate of decay measures the cost of using the waiting 
list as a rationing device. Also, the slope of the TB curve increases as time to treat-
ment lengthens. 
 The net benefit (NB) curve is the difference between TB and TC. Suppose 
that the government is a perfect agent for its citizens. Government officials do not 
pursue their self-interests or their self-interests perfectly coincide with the coun-
try ’ s citizens. Then they would pick the socially optimal length of the waiting list 
by maximizing net benefit. This is equivalent to determining optimal waiting time 
by equating marginal cost and marginal benefit,  t * in   figure 13.1 . 
 Using the analytic framework depicted by   figure 13.1 , one can see how the 
optimal waiting list length varies by type of disease. Suppose that the total cost 
does not vary by disease type. But there is considerable variation among diseases 
in total benefit of treatment and the decay rate of benefit. For some diseases, treat-
ment benefit is high as is the decay rate of benefit; that is, the benefit of treatment 
falls and disappears rapidly if there is a delay in treatment, TB 1 in   figure 13.2 . Then 
a short time to treatment is socially optimal ( t S ). For other diseases, the total benefit 
of treatment is not much affected by how long patients wait for the procedure, TB 2 
in   figure 13.2 . In the latter case, a long wait ( t L ) is likely to be optimal. Thus, the 
socially optimal waiting time for each disease depends on the decay rate in treat-
ment benefit. A higher decay rate in treatment benefit implies a shorter waiting 
time to treatment.  
 The theory is useful for thinking about optimal waiting list lengths and rec-
ognizing that the socially optimal waiting list length is unlikely to be zero. But 
what does the empirical evidence say?  Siciliani, Stanciole, and Jacobs (2009)  esti-
mated the elasticity of hospital cost with respect to the length of waiting lists using 
NHS hospital data for 1998 – 2002. They obtained mixed results on this relationship. 
If there is a negative relationship, it mainly occurs at a low level of waiting list 
length, below 10 days. This research is important but not necessarily definitive, 
being based on a sample of 137 hospitals observed over a relatively short time 
period. 
 While economists like to think in terms of socially optimal values, more 
realistically, government officials act, at least in part, in their own self-interest, 
which leads to an agency problem in setting the optimal length of time to treatment. 
To the extent that such officials do not fully internalize the marginal cost of waiting 
time for the representative patient and instead pursue bragging rights of having cut 
public budgets or other strategies that serve their own interests, these officials may 
select waiting times greater than socially optimal waiting times. For example, 

578 
 Part III / Chapter 13
hospital administrators may prefer to maintain a long waiting list to increase their 
bargaining power for a higher hospital budget in the next period. Similarly, physi-
cians may receive monetary and nonmonetary benefits from maintaining a long 
waiting list. Such delays may increase their income by increasing demand for their 
services in their private practices, or may enable them to select patients with more 
medically interesting diagnoses ( Iversen 1993 ,  1997 ;  Cullis, Jones, and Propper 
2000 ). In the imperfect agent case, the behavior of various public decision makers 
and suppliers of care, as well as the availability of private supply, becomes an 
important determinant of waiting time to care. 
 Iversen (1993 ) used a political bargaining process framework to show that 
how the government and the hospital interact in the budget allocation process 
affects the length of time to treatment. In his model, data on waiting times to 
treatment form an important part of the information base used by government to 
allocate public budgets for health care. In a variant of the model in which the 
budget decision is sequential, the hospital chooses a wait that maximizes its utility 
and is compatible with the government ’ s reaction function; the government ’ s 
reaction function is based on the hospital ’ s choice of waiting time. When the

hospital acts as the leader and the government acts as the follower, the hospital 
has an incentive to maintain long waiting times if the government ’ s willingness to 
pay the hospital increases with increases in waiting times to treatment. This con-
clusion holds for treatments for which the decay rate in treatment benefit is 
relatively small. Then the hospital is incentivized to maintain long waiting lists 
to maintain an optimal budget because waiting time has a positive influence on 
the hospital ’ s budget.  Iversen (1997)  showed that a higher capacity of the private 
health care sector results in a longer waiting time to treatment in the public sector 
if physicians who work in the public sector also work part-time in the private 
sector. 
 Empirical Evidence on the Costs of Waiting Lists 
 Using the waiting list as non-price rationing device imposes several costs on indi-
vidual patients who seek care, as well as on society as a whole. Several empirical 
studies have estimated the costs of waiting lists. Since there is no market for the 
transaction of waiting times among individuals who are on waiting lists, revealed 
preference measures of willingness to pay for shorter waits are not available. 
Researchers, however, have used two indirect approaches to measure the cost of 
waiting lists. The first method estimates the cost of waiting lists from observed 
behavior in the private health care market. The second method uses contingent 
valuation ( “ stated preference ” approach; see chapter 15) to elicit the cost of waiting 
lists ( Cullis, Jones, and Propper 2000 ). As explained in chapter 15, the contingent 
valuation method relies on survey data that elicit individuals ’ maximum willing-
ness to pay for a particular good or service. 
 Cullis and Jones (1986)  employed the first approach to estimate the costs of 
waiting by assuming that the only cost to waiting arises because health care 
received later is worth less. They ignored the cost to waiting arising from the disu-
tility of waiting per se. In the UK health care system, individuals desiring care 
choose between two alternatives: wait on a list for treatment in the public sector 
or  “ opt out ” of the public sector and use the private sector, where the waiting time 
is about zero. The authors argued that the maximum cost of waiting is equal to the 
price of seeking treatment in the private sector ( p ) because the individual will select 
the private sector if the cost of waiting exceeds the price of private health care. If 
the cost of waiting is less than the private price, the individual will eschew private 
care and will wait for care at an NHS facility. The minimum cost of waiting is zero 
if the decay rate of delay in treatment is zero. 
 The above analysis implies that the cost of waiting ranges between  p and 0, 
which in turn implies that the average value of the waiting cost for a representative 
patient is  p /2 , assuming a random distribution of patients.  Cullis and Jones (1986)  
calculated the aggregate cost of waiting lists in the NHS by multiplying the annual 
number of patients waiting for admission to hospitals by the mean value of waiting 
cost per patient ( p /2). They estimated that the cost of waiting ranged from 9 percent 

580 
 Part III / Chapter 13
to 16 percent of UK government expenditure on the NHS, which was equivalent 
to 0.5 – 0.8 percent of GDP in the year to which their analysis applied. 
 In addition to the costs of waiting arising from the decline in treatment ben-
efits over time, the individual on a waiting list for treatment is generally in less 
good health than he or she would be after treatment, even when there is a zero 
decay rate in treatment benefit. 
 More realistically, time spent waiting per se exacts a cost in terms of disutil-
ity.  Propper (1995)  used estimates from a survey to estimate the monetary value of 
this disutility. She found that on average, a reduction of a month spent on a waiting 
list for a nonurgent medical treatment was worth about  £ 50 (in 1991 UK prices). 
In addition, she estimated the monetary value of the disutility arising from uncer-
tainty in the date individuals are actually admitted to a hospital, approximately 
 £ 30 (in 1991 UK prices). Combining these two estimates, the implication is that 
individuals were willing to pay  £ 80 (in 1991 UK prices) per month for reduced 
time to treatment. 
 Using a similar approach with data from Sweden,  Johannesson, Johannesson, 
and S ö derqvist (1998 ) estimated willingness to pay for a reduction of a month on 
a waiting list to be  £ 95 to  £ 110 per month (in 1991 prices). That these two studies 
produced similar results adds strength to the notion that there is a disutility associ-
ated with time spent on waiting lists. 
 Not only do waiting lists exact a cost from those individuals on the waiting 
lists, they also affect the supply of health care in both public and private sectors. 
 Besley, Hall, and Preston (1999)  studied the impact of waiting lists on the supply 
of private care. Waiting lists are associated with a reduction in quality of services 
and inflexibility in the public sector. Thus, those individuals who demand a higher 
quality of health care opt out of the public sector and purchase private health 
insurance to finance their care in the private sector.  Besley, Hall and Preston (1999 ) 
used survey data from the UK to test the hypothesis that demand for private health 
insurance is a function of the quality of care in the public sector and other char-
acteristics, such as personal income. They used long-term waiting lists, measured 
by the number of individuals who were on waiting lists for twelve months or more, 
as a proxy for quality of care in the NHS. 
 The authors found that increases in NHS waiting lists are associated 
with increases in private health insurance purchases in the long term. The pro-
bability of purchasing private health insurance increases by 2 percent when 
the long-term waiting list rises by one person per 1,000 population. Moreover, 
they found that higher-income persons are more likely to purchase private health 
insurance than are those with low incomes. These findings suggest that public 
provision limits the quality of health care owing to waiting lists, and the quality 
of health care is a normal good. A lower quality level in the public sector, gauged 
in terms of long waiting lists, encourages the growth of private insurance 
coverage. 

Public Supply and Financing 
 581
 Martin and Smith (1999)  investigated the effect of waiting times on the supply 
of public care. They developed a simultaneous equation model in which demand 
for and supply of elective surgery depend on waiting times. In their model, waiting 
times act as prices to determine the equilibrium quantity of elective surgery. In 
 figure 13.3 , the horizontal axis represents quantity and the vertical axis represents 
length of time to treatment.  Martin and Smith ’ s (1999)  theoretical analysis shows 
that the demand for elective surgery is negatively associated with increases in 
length of waits. Thus, the demand curve for elective surgery is a downward sloping 
in   figure 13.3 . Time to treatment acts as a price to ration demand. Individual 
demand for elective surgery in the public sector declines as waiting times increase. 
The individual tends to opt out of the public sector and use private care when 
waiting times become long.  
 In contrast, the supply of elective surgery curve is upward sloping. There are 
two plausible reasons for the positive relationship between supply of elective 
surgery and waits. First, as mentioned previously, an increase in waiting time leads 
to additional resources being allocated to care and hence increases in-service 
capacity. Second, an increase in waiting time may increase political pressure on 
public providers and force them to improve efficiency.

 Part III / Chapter 13
 The simultaneous equation model of demand and supply in   figure 13.3  shows 
that the equilibrium time waiting for treatment is determined at the intersection of 
the demand and supply curves.  ω 0 is the equilibrium wait, and  x 0 is the equilibrium 
quantity of elective surgery. This model provides a useful framework for analyzing 
the effectiveness of government policies targeted at reducing waiting time. 
 Since the major cause of lengthy waits is high demand for health care, a 
potential solution for such waits is to increase the supply capacity of the public 
sector, such as by increasing public funds for the number of public hospital beds. 
However, the effort of reducing waiting times through increasing the capacity of 
the public sector may be offset by an increase in demand because the demand for 
elective surgery is responsive to a reduction in waiting time. Thus, whether or not 
increasing public budgets can effectively reduce waiting times for care depends on 
the slope of the demand curve, or the responsiveness of demand with respect to a 
change in waiting times. 
 As shown in   figure 13.3 , an increase in public budgets causes a shift of the 
supply curve from  S to  S ′ , indicating a reduction in waiting times if the quantity 
of services provided remains constant. If demand for elective surgery does not 
increase with decreased waiting time (a vertical demand curve with respect to 
waits), an increase in public funds results in a decrease in the equilibrium waiting 
time from  ω 0 to  ω 1 . However, the decrease in waiting time in turn increases demand 
(as suggested by  Martin and Smith 1999 ). If the demand increase is small, as with 
 D S , then the equilibrium waiting time decreases from  ω 0 to  ω S , and the equilibrium 
quantity increases from  x 0 to  x S as the supply curve shifts to the right. In this case, 
the reduction in waiting time to care resulting from higher levels of public funding 
is offset by only a small increase in demand. Under these circumstances, increasing 
public funding is an effective policy for reducing waiting time to care. 
 By contrast, if the demand increase is large, as with  D L , then equilibrium 
waiting time decreases from  ω 0 to  ω L , and equilibrium quantity increases from  x 0 
to  x L as the supply curve shifts to right. In this case, the reduction in waiting time 
resulting from higher levels of public funding is mostly offset by the demand 
response caused by the decline in waiting times. Then, adding more funds may 
not substantially reduce waiting time. 
 Whether this demand response is small or large is an empirical question. 
 Martin and Smith (1999)  estimated parameters of the simultaneous equation model 
of demand and supply using data from elective surgery in the UK. They found that 
waiting time had the expected negative impact on demand, but the marginal effect 
was small. The long-run elasticity estimate was  – 0.09, indicating that a 1 percent 
decrease in waiting times is associated with a 0.09 percent increase in demand for 
elective surgery. The association between waiting times and the supply of elective 
surgery was relatively large: the elasticity of supply with respect to waiting time 
was 0.35, indicating that a 1 percent increase in waiting times would lead to a 

Public Supply and Financing 
 583
0.35 percent increase in supply of elective surgery. These results suggest that the 
increased demand effect following any reduction in waits is relatively small. Thus, 
increased public funds can be an effective policy to bring about reductions in 
waiting times. 
 The NHS Internal Market 
 An important NHS reform implemented in 1991 and ending in 1997 involved the 
creation of an internal market. The stated purpose of this reform was to use com-
petition to improve the efficiency of the NHS. Under the reform, funds from general 
taxation were transferred to public agents or  “ purchasers, ”  who were given the 
responsibility of purchasing personal health care services for designated popula-
tions. One type of purchaser was the district health authority, which purchased all 
hospital services for persons in a given geographic area. The second type was 
primary care physician groups, General Practice Fundholders, who decided to 
purchase a subset of elective services for their patients. The reform transformed 
GP groups into Fundholders; capitation payments were increased to cover not only 
primary care but also prescriptions and nonemergency hospital care ( Martin 
and Smith 1999 ;  Aaron and Schwartz 2005 ). As Fundholders, GP groups were 
both (1) providers of primary care and (2) physician case managers who 
assumed responsibility for allocating resources among primary care, elective pro-
cedures, and outpatient prescription drugs. This dual role in turn affected GPs ’ 
incentive to refer, which may have reduced their rates of referrals to specialists or 
hospitals. 
 From the vantage point of hospitals, the effect of the reform was to tighten 
hospitals ’  budget constraints and increase their uncertainty, especially about 
revenue. If hospitals did not successfully compete on both price and waiting lists 
(time until patients were admitted by the hospital), they lost operating revenue. 
 Propper, Burgess, and Gossage (2008 ) assessed the impact of this experiment with 
competition on mortality rates following heart attacks. They found that increased 
competition from this reform led to decreased quality as measured by 30-day (post-
admission) heart attack mortality outcomes. 
 The authors argued that such hospital-specific mortality rates are poorly 
observed by the public, and hence quality, which affects such rates, can be cut 
without there being an adverse effect on demand for the hospital ’ s services 
( box 13.1 ). However, competition also reduced time spent on hospital waiting 
lists, and elective admissions rose. In contrast to mortality rates, the authors 
contended that the length of a hospital ’ s waiting list is easily observed by the 
public. Hence, demand for care at a hospital is highly waiting list length elastic. 
This way, hospitals in a competitive environment could cut cost and shift their 
demand curves outward, thus being able to operate within their tight budget 
constraints.

 Box 13.1 
 Does a Pro-Competitive NHS Reform Save Lives? 
 Whether or not increased competition leads to a higher or lower quality of health care 
is still unsettled empirically. Most empirical estimates in this line of research rely on 
studies that use nonexperimental data obtained from the US Medicare program. Here 
we present a study that exploits a policy change in the UK ’ s NHS program to identify 
the effect of competition on health care quality. 
 In 2006, the UK government adopted a new round of market-oriented reforms to 
promote competition between hospitals. Compared to the previous reform on the NHS 
internal market discussed in this chapter, the 2006 NHS reforms introduced two major 
changes. First, the reform provided patients with a choice of five providers for their 
hospital care. To help patients make more informed choices, the government also 
introduced a new information system that provided information on quality and 
allowed patients to book hospital appointments online. Second, the reform changed 
the hospital payment system from negotiated (between buyer and seller) to ex ante 
fixed prices, which are a case-based payment system known as  “ payment by results. ” 
This new payment system is similar to the Medicare hospital payment system in the 
United States. 
 A potential effect of increasing patient choice is to increase the (quality) elasticity 
of demand faced by hospitals, which in turn leads to more intense competition. In 
addition, the shift of payment system from negotiated prices to fixed prices should 
encourage firms to compete for consumers on non-price dimensions — that is, qual-
ity — if the regulated price is set above marginal cost. 
 Gaynor, Morena-Serra, and Propper (2010)  used the context of this NHS reform to 
implement a difference-in-differences research design to test the hypothesis that the 
pro-competitive policy improved hospital quality. Specifically, they identified the 
impact of competition from the interaction of market concentration index (as mea-
sured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) with a binary variable for the post-reform 
year. This is because the intensity of the competition induced by the reforms may be 
expected to vary according to market structure: a hospital in an unconcentrated 
market would face more exposure to the policy change than would a hospital in a 
highly concentrated market. By using data from 2003 to capture the period before the 
policy change and data from 2007 for the period after the policy change, the authors 
tested their hypothesis on market concentration. Their database contained informa-
tion on approximately 68,000 discharges per year per hospital from 162 hospitals. 
 The empirical estimates show that the introduction of competition significantly 
reduced heart attack and all-cause death rates in markets with lower levels of market 
concentration, without changing total expenditures. This result suggests that the 
introduction of competition led to an increase in quality of hospital care without a 
commensurate increase in expenditures on care. 
 The authors further calculated the benefits in monetary terms from the observed 
change in market structure following the reforms. First, between 2003 and 2007, the 
reform led to a decrease in market concentration index by 118. Second, the estimated

 Australia 
 Overview 
 Implemented in 1984, Australia ’ s universal health insurance program, which is 
also known as Medicare, covers Australian citizens, New Zealand citizens, and 
holders of permanent visas. Some visitors and temporary residents from countries 
with which Australia has made reciprocal health care agreements are also eligible 
for Medicare, with some restrictions. Australia ’ s Medicare is funded through 
general revenue, which in turn is largely income tax – based and progressive 
( Hall 1999 ). 
 An interesting feature of Australia ’ s Medicare program involves the integra-
tion of public financing and public provision of care during a covered person ’ s 
hospital stay. Although this feature is similar to the NHS in the UK, there are two 
differences between Australia ’ s Medicare and the UK ’ s NHS. First, there is a larger 
private health sector in Australia than in the UK. In 2005, private funds, including 
those from private health insurance and individuals ’ out-of-pocket costs, contrib-
uted 33 percent of total health expenditure in Australia, compared with 13 percent 
in the UK. Similarly, the private hospital sector in Australia accounts for 30 percent 
of admissions and 25 percent of all hospital bed days ( Hall 1999 ). Second, in con-
trast to the UK, there is no patient registration and there are no restrictions on 
where GPs may establish their practice. Consequently, patients enjoy free choice 
of providers. That is, patients can choose whether to be treated in public or private 
hospitals, and can attend whichever public hospital they like ( Scott, Schurer, 
Jensen, et al. 2009 ). 
 On admission to public hospitals, patients may choose to be public (Medi-
care) patients or private patients. If they choose to be public patients, they receive 
free medical and allied health or paramedical care from physicians selected by the 
hospitals, accommodation at no out-of-pocket expense, meals, and other health 
services while hospitalized. Medicare-eligible patients who choose to be private 
coefficient suggests that the average hospital experienced a 0.2 percent fall in its 
overall mortality rate from this decrease in the market concentration index. Third, a 
0.2 percent drop in mortality led to an estimated 3,354 life years saved, given that 
the average age at death of patients in hospital was 77 years, and a 77-year-old patient 
had an additional life expectancy of 9.5 years for a male and 11 years for a female, 
respectively. Fourth, the monetary benefit of the life years saved was equal to US$335.4 
million, assuming US$100,000 for the value of a year of life. 
 Overall, this study suggests that the effect of the pro-competitive NHS reform was 
to save lives without raising costs.

patients in public hospitals are charged fees by doctors, and are charged by the 
hospital for hospital care, usually at a price less than the full cost of providing 
these services. 
 If the patient is eligible for private insurance, such insurance usually covers 
all or nearly all of the charges by a public hospital. Medicare subsidizes part of phy-
sicians ’  fees and private insurance pays an additional amount toward such fees. An 
advantage of patients of using private sources for payment in a public hospital is 
that they can choose their own physicians. Private insurance benefits can also pay 
part of the amounts charged the patient for allied health or paramedical care and 
other costs (e.g., surgically implanted prostheses) incurred during the hospital stay. 
 People may choose care in a private hospital. Private patients in private hos-
pitals are charged fees by doctors and some allied health/paramedical staff, and 
are billed by the hospital for accommodation, nursing care, and other hospital 
services, such as the use of operating rooms for surgery. 
 Charges incurred by patients receiving private doctors ’ services or surgery, 
whether in or out of hospital, are generally reimbursed at least in part by Medicare. 
For out-of-hospital services, private insurers are prohibited from insuring all or 
part of the cost of the difference between the Medicare benefit and the fee charged 
by the doctor. This provision aims to avoid incentives for unnecessary increases 
in fees. 
 The purchase of private insurance is encouraged by imposing a financial 
penalty on persons above a certain income threshold who do not purchase such 
insurance. Private insurance is purchased by individuals and families, in contrast 
to the United States, where most private insurance is provided through a person ’ s 
place of employment. The coexistence of private health insurance and a universal 
public insurance program allows some individuals to opt out of the restrictions of 
the public health sector. Overall, the benefits of purchasing private health insur-
ance in Australia include more choice of physicians, shorter waiting lists for some 
procedures, and greater access to new (and expensive) treatment and equipment 
( Jensen, Webster, and Witt 2009 ). 
 Empirical Evidence 
 In 1989 – 1990, 44 percent of households had private hospital insurance and 35 
percent of hospital users used a private facility ( Savage and Wright 2003 ). Length 
of stay in private hospitals has been shown to be increased, at least for some demo-
graphic groups, when the patient is covered by private insurance ( Savage and 
Wright 2003 ). 
 Jensen, Webster, and Witt (2009 ) studied the health outcomes of persons 
admitted to public and private hospitals with a primary diagnosis of a heart attack. 
Outcome measures were readmission to a hospital for a heart attack and mortality. 
In terms of these outcomes, the authors found that private hospitals persistently 
outperformed public hospitals. Private hospitals in their analysis sample were both 
for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. They attributed the better performance of 

Public Supply and Financing 
 587
private hospitals to budget constraints, which were more binding on input use in 
public than in private hospitals. They argued that the difference in outcomes was 
unlikely to be due to differences in physician quality since the same physicians 
generally cared for patients in public and private hospitals.

 Public Provision of Personal Health Care 
Services in Other Countries 
 High-Income Countries 
 Pedersen (2005 , 164) characterized Scandinavian health care systems  “ as a decen-
tralized NHS. ” None of these systems is operated by the central government; they 
are operated and financed by either counties — in Denmark and Sweden, munici-
palities — in Finland and to some extent in Norway, or the state is the sole owner 
and shareholder of regional corporations that run the country ’ s hospitals, as in 
Norway. In Finland and Sweden, GPs are generally employed by counties. In 
Denmark and Norway, GPs are private but are regulated by counties and munici-
palities, respectively ( Pedersen 2005 , 165). Although there is a trend toward more 
private involvement in each of these countries, the Scandinavian welfare model 
for health care basically remains intact. In 2005, public expenditure on health as 
a percentage of total expenditures on health in these four countries remained high 
compared to other OECD countries, ranging from 75 percent in Finland to 83.5 
percent in Norway. Public provision may have reduced but has not completely 
eliminated differences by income in the burden of disease (see, e.g.,  Ljung, Peter-
son, Hallqvist, et al. 2005 ). 
 Middle- and Low-Income Countries 
 Dominance of Public Ownership Form 
 Public provision is dominant in numerous middle- and low-income countries. For 
example, in Asia, in about the year 2000, among selected Asian countries, public 
provision was dominant in Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Nepal, the 
Philippines, Punjab, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Despite public provision, consumers 
paid for more than half of expenditures in the form of out-of-pocket payments in 
well over half of these countries ( O ’ Donnell, van Doorslaer, Rannan-Eliya, et al. 
2008 ; see also chapter 11, this book). In the Kyrgyz Republic and other Central 
Asian countries, public provision is a legacy of the Soviet era. While these coun-
tries offer universal access to at least basic health care services, they have often 
suffered from years of underinvestment in facilities, and in rural areas even basic 
amenities such as running water or sewage are lacking ( McKee and Healy 2002 , 7). 
In at least one of these countries, Kazakhstan, the situation has improved in recent 
years because of its oil resources and increases in the price of oil. 

588 
 Part III / Chapter 13
 In Central America, Costa Rica relies on the public provision of personal 
health care services ( Dow and S á enz 2002 ) and overall has excellent health out-
comes. Two-thirds of physicians are public employees, although most also have 
private offices. Although health indicators of the country ’ s population are favor-
able, there are frequent complaints about the quality of publicly provided health 
care services. There are long queues, and there have been complaints about lack of 
motivation among civil service workers, which have led some users to opt for 
private physicians ’ services. Workers employed by the state are not incentivized to 
be productive. For one, there is no threat of unemployment for poor performance. 
 Nigeria, like Bangladesh, is among the countries with the lowest level of per 
capita income in the world. Health care systems in very poor countries tend to be 
publicly operated and financed. Such systems are plagued by problems of under-
staffing, lack of equipment, inadequate logistics for delivering even essential drugs, 
and poor incentives for government workers (see, e.g.,  Lacey 2002 ). It is difficult, 
however, to disentangle the effects of system ownership from pervasive lack of 
resources in such countries. Even in low-income countries there is not complete 
reliance on public finance and provision. For example, in several low-income 
countries — C ô te d ’ Ivoire, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, and Zimbabwe —
 more than five percent of total expenditures on personal health care services came 
from private health insurance in 2001 ( Sekhri and Savedoff 2005 ). 
 Evidence on Quality of Care 
 A persistent finding from many low-income countries in particular is that quality 
of care is low. This conclusion is based on evidence from vignettes that present 
hypothetical cases to physicians and elicit how these physicians would respond 
in these situations, and from direct observation of how physicians respond in treat-
ing actual patients (see, e.g.,  Banerjee, Deaton, and Duflo 2004 ;  Das and Gertler 
2007 ). In the majority of these situations, the physician is a public sector employee. 
 Why is quality of care as low as it is reported to be? There are several pos-
sibilities. First, the physicians could lack the quality of medical education that 
physicians in more affluent countries receive. Second, because of the relative 
poverty of their countries, hospitals and clinics could lack the facilities and equip-
ment that physicians in high-income countries typically have. Third, physicians 
in low-income countries could be competent on average but lack incentives to exert 
effort in patient care. Incentives could be lacking because of inadequate monitoring 
of physician performance by system managers or because pay is based on factors 
other than actual performance. These factors could be political or personal favorit-
ism, years of schooling completed, or seniority. Another possibility is that physi-
cian compensation is so low in low-income countries with public systems that 
physicians feel compelled to moonlight in the private sector. For all of these 
reasons, quality may be low because of inadequate clinician effort rather than 
because of low competence or lack of facilities and equipment. 

Public Supply and Financing 
 589
 Empirical analysis of these issues has been conducted in only a few countries, 
and in only a few communities within these countries. Thus, generalizability is an 
issue. Nevertheless, studies to date have revealed some interesting and important 
findings. First, high rates of absenteeism have been documented for schoolteachers 
and medical personnel ( Chaudhury, Hammer, Kremer, et al. 2006 ). Absenteeism 
rates tend to be higher for the latter. Medical personnel presumably have better 
opportunities than teachers to work in the private sector. Often, when health care 
providers are absent, the facility is closed. A patient (frequently accompanied by 
family members) may travel a long distance to visit a facility, only to find it closed. 
High rates of absenteeism have been attributed to inadequate monitoring and civil 
service systems. Civil service systems in many countries were established to protect 
government employees from being discharged because of their political views or 
affiliations. This is an advantage of such systems. However, such systems often 
base compensation on educational attainment and tenure rather than on perfor-
mance on the job. Clearly, educational attainment and tenure can be objectively 
measured, while measures of performance can contain a subjective component. 
Thus, a poor performance evaluation can be used as the basis for discharging an 
employee who is objectionable on political grounds. But a poor performance evalu-
ation may also mean actual poor performance, and civil service systems often 
prevent appropriate as well as inappropriate use of performance measures. If pro-
motion and pay are not to be based on performance, there is understandably a 
lesser incentive to perform well. Regular attendance at work is one attribute of good 
performance. Aside from civil service regulation, public employment decision 
making in at least some low-income countries is highly centralized — in India, for 
example, at the level of the Indian state. 
 Second, studies have used essentially two approaches to measure quality of 
care. In one approach, a person acts as if he or she were a patient and presents a 
reason for the visit, and the clinician acts on what he or she hears from the patient. 
Quality of care is based on the clinician ’ s response to the scenario as presented by 
this actor-patient. The clinician is told that this is not a real patient. In the second 
approach, the clinician ’ s response to an actual patient is monitored by an indepen-
dent observer. Quality of care is judged to be inadequate if the clinician does not 
provide care that is appropriate to the specific situation. With both approaches, 
quality of care has been judged to be often inadequate in low-income countries in 
which such studies have been conducted. 
 Third, there is an issue of whether low-quality of care is mainly attributable 
to low levels of provider competence or to the amount of effort exerted in the 
provision of low quality of care, conditional on a given level of competence. The 
evidence seems to favor the latter explanation. The study researchers directly 
measured clinical competence, which seemed to be adequate. The main source of 
low-quality care seemed to be in providers not applying what they knew ( Leonard, 
Masatu, and Vialou 2007 ). 

590 
 Part III / Chapter 13
 Fourth, patients seem to be aware of quality-of-care differences among provid-
ers. Patients do not always visit the nearest facility but select from among alterna-
tive facilities those offering relatively higher quality. Facilities judged to be inferior 
based on independent evaluations of quality are sometimes bypassed by patients, 
presumably because patients also judge them to be inferior ( Leonard 2007 ;  Klemick, 
Leonard, and Masatu 2009 ). Patient choice of facility is systematically influenced 
by variation in process quality ( Mariko 2003 ). 
 Fifth, visit rates in the communities included in the studies are not that dif-
ferent from visit rates in more affluent countries. The problem seems to be with 
the quality, not quantity, of care. 
 Sixth, although health status is lower in low-income than in middle- or high-
income countries, a causal effect of the provision of low-quality services on poor 
population health has not been established. There is a positive correlation between 
quality of care and population health; a causal relationship may be presumed but 
has not been rigorously demonstrated by research. Even if there is a causal effect, 
its importance relative to other factors leading to poor health is currently unknown. 
 Seventh, the quality-of-care indicators reported in the studies represent aver-
ages. Quality of care varies cross-sectionally in these as in other countries. 
 Public Policy Options for Improving Quality of Care 
 Diagnosing a problem, in this context, low quality of care, is one thing. Doing 
something about it is another. There are several possible types of public policies 
that might be implemented to address this issue. 
 First, since most of the facilities are publicly owned and most employment 
is public, one approach would be privatization of health care delivery in low-
income countries. Although some studies have found that quality is higher in 
private facilities (see, e.g.,  Lien, Chou, and Liu 2008 ; see also chapter 6, this book), 
there is no consensus that private facilities are better even in high-income coun-
tries. And there is no consistent empirical evidence that quality of care is higher 
in private facilities in low-income countries either. Further, if the issue is inade-
quate monitoring and inadequate incentives to provide high quality of care, the 
solution involves improving monitoring and incentives rather than making 
changes in ownership per se. For example, decentralizing public decision making 
( Pandey, Sehgal, Riboud, et al. 2007 ;  Singh 2008 ) and giving these decision makers 
power to promote and grant pay increases based in part on performance would 
represent more direct approaches than the more general strategy of changing own-
ership form. 
 A second approach involves expansion of facilities for medical education in 
low-income countries, coupled with policies to promote the retention of physi-
cians. Such policies may have merit in their own right, but, as noted above, there 
does not seem to be a deficiency in the quantity of care residents of low-income 
countries receive as much as there is inadequate quality. 

Public Supply and Financing 
 591
 Third, improved public regulation of health care quality is often proposed as 
a solution to the widespread provision of low-quality care. Such regulation can 
take the form of barring entry to low-quality facilities or to health professionals 
with inadequate training. Such barriers to entry generally take the form of facility 
and professional licensure. But for such entry limitations to be effective, they must 
be enforced. Furthermore, economists have long been suspicious of such regulation 
since entry regulation serves to grant existing providers a de facto franchise, which 
in turn gives them market power. Another disadvantage is that, barring an egregious 
act, licensure is forever. As a practical matter, delicensure is rare. 
 Fourth, policies that empower health care consumers to monitor the quality 
of care they receive may enhance the quality of care that is provided. The presump-
tion underlying this set of public policies is that quality of care is poor when 
consumers are insufficiently empowered to do anything about it. 
 Empirical Evidence on Effects of Interventions to Improve Quality of Care 
 Two recent studies have assessed the success of interventions in low-income coun-
tries specifically designed to empower consumers in this way.  Pandey, Sehgal, 
Riboud, et al. (2007 ) report the results of a randomized controlled trial conducted 
in Uttar Pradesh, a very populous (180+ million residents) in northern India, 
designed to determine the impact of provision of information to consumers on the 
provision of health and social services. The underlying hypothesis was that once 
consumers were informed about quality and other attributes of services, they would 
be better able to monitor the performance of providers in their local market areas. 
 Sites for the experiment were randomly selected. By randomly selecting sites, 
confirming that sites in the intervention group were similar to those in the control 
group at baseline, and conducting a follow-up one year after information was pro-
vided at the intervention sites, the authors could validly attribute changes in the 
use of health services following implementation of the intervention to the interven-
tion itself. Randomizing the intervention among individuals in a given site (village), 
that is, providing information to some residents of a community and not to others, 
would likely have been viewed as unethical. Not providing the information to resi-
dents of all communities in the state could easily be justified on the basis of budget 
constraints. 
 At baseline and follow-up, households were asked questions about access to 
health care and social services. For example, one health care question was whether 
or not a nurse midwife had visited the adult female household member of child-
bearing age when she was pregnant. On social services, people were asked whether 
or not their school-aged children attended school, and if so, the school fees charged; 
whether or not there had been a village council meeting in the last six months; and 
whether or not development work had been or was being performed in the village. 
 With a couple of exceptions, post intervention, the use of personal health care 
services was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control 

592 
 Part III / Chapter 13
group. Prenatal examinations were 30 percent higher, tetanus vaccinations were 27 
percent higher, and the use of prenatal supplements and infant vaccinations were 
24 and 25 percent higher, respectively, in the intervention group than in the control 
group. 
 There were also differences in the social services domain. For example, 
the probability of having had a village council meeting in the last six months 
was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group. 
Overcharging of tuition declined in the intervention group relative to the con-
trol group. Overall, the authors concluded that their findings highlighted the 
importance of empowering communities to facilitate individual and collective 
action. 
 A similar field experiment was conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and described 
by  Bj ö rkman and Svensson (2009 ). This study was conducted in fifty communities 
in nine districts in Uganda. The intervention consisted of village and staff meetings 
facilitated by local nongovernmental organizations and designed to encourage 
development of a plan to improve and facilitate implementation of a plan to 
improve quality of service provision. As in the previous study, there was random-
ization by community. 
 The study began with surveys of fifty health care providers and a survey of 
households. Following collection of these data, a series of meetings was held in 
those communities randomly selected for the intervention. No meetings were held 
in the control communities. 
 In the intervention villages, there were meetings with community members. 
These meetings included a discussion of concerns that residents of the communi-
ties had about the local provision of health care services. Common concerns were 
the high rates of absenteeism, long patient waits at the facilities, inattention of the 
medical staff to patients, and differential treatment depending on the patient ’ s 
status in the community. In addition, there were meetings at a health facility in 
each intervention community and interface meetings between community members 
and health workers. 
 A main study outcome involved whether or not the intervention increased 
the quantity and quality of health services provision and whether or not the inter-
vention improved health outcomes. The researchers also paid attention to changes 
at all steps in the accountability chain. Did the intervention communities become 
more involved in monitoring health workers in their areas? As a result of the inter-
vention, did health worker behavior change? 
 The study documented improvements in the use of available equipment 
during health examinations and reductions in patient waiting times at the clinics. 
On average, following the intervention, the absentee rate was thirteen percentage 
points lower at intervention facilities than at control facilities versus no difference 
before the intervention. Vaccinations of children increased in intervention

communities. Persons in intervention communities appeared to be more involved 
in monitoring the providers after the intervention. 
 That both studies showed that empowering consumers led to improvements in 
health services provision and outcomes is interesting and important. The interven-
tion did not involve implementing major organizational changes from the top down.  
 Nevertheless, this approach to empowering consumers should not be viewed 
as a panacea. Rather, it represents one approach, if a promising one, to quality 
improvement. Further studies of this type should have a high priority. 
 13.4 
 Evaluation and Comparison of Health Care 
Systems 
 One very knowledgeable commentator on health care systems has remarked, 
 “ Choices of financing and provision of healthcare are determined by ethics and 
ideology ”  ( Maynard 2005 , 4). The choice is never made on the basis of economic 
analysis. We are reluctant to go this far in rejecting the role of economics in shaping 
health care systems. But we acknowledge that much, if not most, of the variation 
in health care systems in countries around the world cannot be explained by eco-
nomic reasoning. 
 Even conceding this, economists have important roles to play in improving 
decision making conditional on a choice of health care financing and provision 
having been made and even helping inform decision makers about the trade-offs 
involved in choosing among types of health systems. 
 As in classifying health care systems, the evaluation and comparison of health 
care systems is not a straightforward exercise. In this section, we employ two 
methods for assessing the performance of different health systems. The first uses 
a set of intermediate performance measures that has been widely used and described 
in terms of indicators of access, cost, and quality. The second uses two performance 
goals that measure the overall performance of a system, efficiency and equity. 
Clearly, neither approach alone captures all aspects of system performance. Rather, 
the combination of the two methods provides insights useful for understanding 
overall performance among different health care systems. 
 Comparisons Based on Intermediate Performance Measures 
 Access 
 Access  refers to individuals ’ ease of consuming personal health services. Since 
personal health care services are an important input in the production of good 
health, access to health care has long been widely perceived as a right, not a good 

594 
 Part III / Chapter 13
to be consumed by only some members of society. Thus, access is a frequently used 
measure of intermediate performance. Although access is multidimensional, 
encompassing financial (e.g., the out-of-pocket cost to individual consumers of 
health care services), geographic (e.g., distance to health care providers), and cul-
tural (e.g., ability to communicate with providers because of language similarities 
or differences) factors, most studies and statistical indicators focus on the financial 
dimension. The question is whether the poor have the same access to health care 
as the non-poor. There are at least two major indicators that can be used to measure 
financial accessibility to health care. 
 One is the percentage of the population covered by health insurance. In a 
system with public provision and financing, all citizens have free or nearly free 
access to health care, at least in terms of facing zero or nearly zero money prices. 
In a system with private supply, access to health care depends on whether insur-
ance coverage is compulsory or not. With public provision of health insurance, 
insurance is compulsory, so coverage extends to the entire population (universal 
coverage) or to certain groups of population based on region, occupation, and eco-
nomic activity ( “ corporatism ” ). By contrast, in a system of private provision of 
health insurance, individuals may be uninsured under the guise of  “ free choice ” 
or  “ lower ability to pay. ” In this respect, countries with private provision of health 
insurance tend to be at a disadvantage in achieving equal access to personal health 
care services. The percentage of the population covered by health insurance pro-
vides only a rough measure of access to personal health care services because 
health insurance program benefits vary among countries and even among health 
insurance plans within a country. Some countries provide health insurance with 
comprehensive coverage while others provide health insurance with only limited 
coverage. 
 A second indicator for measuring access is the degree of generosity of insur-
ance coverage. While an average coinsurance rate — the percentage of personal 
health care expenditures not covered by public and private health insurance — is 
such a measure, there is a practical issue of which services to include for the pur-
poses of computing the percentage. For example, should expenditures on nursing 
home care be included or not? The answer is likely to vary among countries. In a 
country in which elderly, disabled persons are primarily cared for by other family 
members, having access to nursing home care is likely to be less critical than in 
countries in which there is substantial reliance on purchased services for the care 
of such persons. 
 There are three ways of moving toward increasing financial accessibility to 
health care: (1) by increasing breadth (who is insured?), (2) by increasing depth 
(which benefits are covered?), and (3) by increasing height (what proportion of the 
costs is covered?) (  fig. 13.4 ). Increasing insurance coverage to more of a country ’ s 
population leads to universal coverage through added breadth. Adding more ser-
vices, such as new medical technologies and nursing home care, to the list of 

Public Supply and Financing 
 595
services covered by public insurance increases the depth toward universal cover-
age. Reducing cost sharing increases the height toward universal coverage. These 
three directions, working together, increase the share of public expenditure on 
health (and reduce the share of out-of-pocket cost) and hence increase financial 
accessibility to personal health care services.  
 A higher out-of-pocket share leads to lower equality in access because such 
access is more likely to depend on ability to pay in systems with higher out-of-
pocket share. The out-of-pocket share ranges from 6 percent to 51 percent in OECD 
countries (  fig. 13.5 ). Countries with public financing and supply tend to have a 
lower out-of-pocket share. However, some countries with universal coverage, such 
as South Korea, do not have a lower out-of-pocket share than some countries 
relying on the private provision of health insurance, in particular the United States. 
These exceptions occur because universal coverage may provide health insurance 
with limited benefits. Overall, countries with a higher share of public financing 
have a lower share of out-of-pocket payments, except the United States. Thus, the 
choice of health care system per se does not provide a precondition for ensuring 
equal access to health care.  
 Cost 
 Although countries in the world make various efforts to provide their citizens with 
full or easy access to health care,  “ affordability ”  is another major consideration.

Scarce resources, labor and capital inputs, are used in the production of personal 
health services. If other factors, including service quality, are held equal, from 
society ’ s vantage point (but not necessarily from the vantage point of the private 
interest of suppliers of health care services), lower resource use is to be preferred 
to higher levels of resource use. Thus, cost is the second indicator in measuring 
the intermediate performance of health care system. 1 We use total health expendi-
tures within a country as a measure of cost for purposes of comparing intermediate 
performance using countries ’ health care systems. 
 Following  Newhouse ’ s (1977)  pioneering work, international comparisons of 
health expenditure have become a well-developed research area. A stylized fact 
evident from these comparisons is that there is substantial variation in per capita 
health expenditures among countries, ranging from spending US$16 to US$5,274 
(in 2002 purchasing power party) a year. Among the factors accounting for such 
differences, the relationship between health expenditures and per capita GDP is 
the one that is best documented. National income is the most important factor in 
explaining international differences in health care expenditures. There is a positive 
relationship between health expenditure per capita and GDP per capita, the

estimated income elasticity is greater than one ( Gerdtham and J ö nsson 2000 ). A 10 
percent increase in GDP is associated with an even higher rate of increase in health 
care spending. Thus, there is also a positive relationship between share of GDP 
spent on health care and GDP per capita (  fig. 13.6 ). High-income countries tend to 
spend a larger portion of their GDP on health care than low-income countries. 
Economic growth and the growth of health care spending are simultaneously 
determined. Higher economic growth spurs increases in health care spending, but 
such spending is also productive in terms of stimulating economic growth (see 
chapter 16).  
 Although income is the most important variable accounting for the substan-
tial differences in health expenditures among countries, other non-income vari-
ables, including institutional features of health systems, also are quantitatively 
important in determining the level of health expenditures. Several studies have 
found that countries with primary care physicians as gatekeepers for inpatient and 
specialist care or countries that pay their physicians on a capitation basis have 
lower health expenditures (see chapter 11). The introduction of a gatekeeper mech-
anism reduces health expenditure by 18 percent on average compared to systems 
without gatekeepers. Similarly, capitation systems lead to lower health expendi-
tures by around 17 – 21 percent compared to fee-for-service systems ( Gerdtham and

J ö nsson 2000 ). Since gatekeepers and capitation have been widely used in systems 
with public provision of health services, most notably in the UK, the above-
mentioned empirical findings suggest that countries with public provision of 
health services are in a better position to control spending on personal health care 
services. However, as mentioned above, this goal has been achieved by using 
waiting lists as rationing devices. There is a trade-off between controlling health 
care costs and improving timely access to health care. 
 In addition to public provision, public financing also an important factor to 
explain the variations in health expenditure across countries. For example, 
 Gerdtham, S ø gaard, Andersson, et al. (1992)  assessed determinants of spending on 
personal health services in nineteen OECD countries. These researchers did not 
find that countries with a higher share of public financing had higher health expen-
diture as would be consistent with the efficiency argument, namely, that public 
systems are less efficient. In fact, the opposite was true. When the share of public 
health expenditure increased by 10 percent, total health care expenditures fell by 
about 5 percent, but total spending on inpatient care was less responsive to the 
public-private financing mix. A 10 percent increase in the share of public health 
expenditure reduced such expenditure by only 2.2 percent on average. Although 
both public financing and public supply are advantageous in containing costs as 
measured by total health expenditures, this type of measure excludes costs arising 
from rationing access to personal health care services. 
 The United States is an outlier in terms of the GDP share spent on health care 
(see   fig. 13.6 ). In 2005, health care spending accounted for nine percent of GDP on 
average in thirty OECD countries. By contrast, the United States allocated 15.2 
percent of its GDP to health care. The substantial deviation in health spending from 
the average level of OECD countries raises an important question as to why the 
United States spends so much on health care compared to other high-income 
countries. 
 Woolhandler, Campbell, Himmelstein, et al. (2003)  attributed this deviation 
to differences in health administrative costs among countries. They found that 
administrative costs accounted for 31 percent of total health expenditures in the 
United States but only 17 percent of such expenditures in Canada. More recently, 
 Spithoven (2009)  confirmed that variations in health administrative costs matter. 
He concluded that differences in administrative costs between the United States 
and Canada accounted for 15 – 50 percent of the five percentage point difference in 
GDP share spent on health care between these two countries. A widely accepted 
explanation for higher administrative costs in the United States is that this country 
has a pluralistic health care financing system. Systems with private provision of 
health insurance may pay a price for satisfying the wants of consumers with het-
erogeneous preferences. 
 In addition to the higher administrative cost, there are other arguments as 
well.  Anderson, Reinhardt, Hussey, et al. (2003) concluded that the higher prices 

Public Supply and Financing 
 599
of personal health care services in the United States are the major factor account-
ing for the higher health expenditures in the United States compared to other 
high-income countries. They based this conclusion on a finding that the utilization 
of health care services in the United States by various measures is consistently 
below the median level in OECD countries, although the United States spends 
much more on health care than any other country.  Spithoven (2009)  agreed 
with this argument. By comparing determinants of health expenditures in 
the United States and Canada, Spithoven found that pharmaceutical price differ-
ences alone accounted for 4 – 20 percent of the five percentage point difference 
in GDP share allocated to health care between these two countries. Such evi-
dence suggests that a system dominated by public payer(s) or a single payer may 
have an advantage in controlling health care costs compared to systems in which 
private payers or multiple payers predominate. However, cost containment may 
come at the expense of decreasing health care innovation ( Grabowski and Wang 
2006 ). 
 Quality 
 Based on relative cost alone, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions about 
the relative efficiency of public versus private health care systems. A health system 
with lower costs may be achieved at the expense of lower quality because higher 
quality is costly to produce. For example, providers or payers may compromise 
service quality (may adversely affect health care outcomes) under a strict cost-
containment policy or in an environment of tight health care budgets. That is, there 
is a trade-off between cost and quality. Quality is another important indicator to 
measure the intermediate performance of different health care systems. 
 Like access, quality is multidimensional (see chapter 7). The most common 
outcome comparison across countries is that of the United States and Canada 
because of similarities in history (both were British colonies), demographic char-
acteristics, and medical education, and their geographic proximity. Based on the 
data of patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of heart attack (AMI for acute 
myocardial infarction), several studies have reached almost the same conclusion, 
namely, that mortality rates of AMI patients are very similar in the United States 
and Canada. The US-to-Canada one-year mortality ratio ranges from 0.96 to 1, 
indicating that the outcomes of AMI patients are a few percentage points better in 
the United States or are equal in the two countries ( Cutler 2002 ). 
 In addition, there is only limited evidence on outcome comparisons between 
the United States and other countries.  Noguchi, Masuda, Kuzuya, et al. (2006)  
compared treatments and outcomes for heart attack patients in the United States 
and Japan. They measured short-term quality by 30-day mortality and readmission 
to a hospital within 30 days, and long-term quality by one-year mortality and one-
year readmission. For patients undergoing intensive procedures such as cardiac 
catheterization within seven days of the first hospital admission for an AMI, they 

600 
 Part III / Chapter 13
found that short-term quality was similar in the United States and Japan but long-
term quality was very different in these two countries. After accounting for other 
factors, long-term quality, as measured by mortality and hospital readmission rates, 
tended to be much better in the United States than in Japan. However, for patients 
not undergoing intensive procedures such as cardiac catheterization, both short- 
and long-term quality were better in Japan than in the United States. Given these 
conflicting findings, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about quality in 
the United States versus Japan. 
 Comparisons Based on Two Performance Goals 
 Efficiency 
 In economics,  efficiency bundles two key concepts, how services are produced and 
what services are produced. The former is defined as  technical efficiency — a good 
or service is produced at minimum cost, which in turn is described by any point 
on the production possibility frontier. Technical inefficiency is reduced by lower-
ing the unit cost of producing a given service. The latter is  allocative efficiency — the 
optimal mix of outputs that achieves the goal of maximizing social welfare or health 
gain, which in turn is described by the right (optimal) point on the production 
possibility frontier. Allocative inefficiency is reduced by altering the mix of ser-
vices that the health system produces so that more health gains or higher social 
welfare is achieved from a given resource endowment. 
 With regard to technical efficiency, there are two prevailing views of 
alternative health systems. First, countries with a single-payer system have an 
efficiency advantage over the countries with multipayer systems because of lower 
administrative costs ( Woolhandler, Campbell, and Himmelstein 2003 ; see also 
chapter 11, this book). However, based on cost alone, and without comparing health 
outcomes across countries, one should not draw definitive conclusions about 
the relative efficiency of single-payer versus multiple-payer systems. Second, 
countries with a public health care provision often seem to be at an efficiency 
disadvantage compared to countries with a private supply because it is assumed 
that public provision is less efficient. However, even if this assumption were sup-
portable empirically, evidence obtained from micro studies, such as comparative 
studies of hospitals with different ownership forms, does not necessarily apply 
to the whole system. At the country level, there is certainly no widely accepted 
evidence showing that the direct public provision of health care is any less 
efficient. 
 With regard to allocative efficiency, the evidence is more convincing than for 
technical efficiency. Compared to a system with private financing, countries with 
public sector financing tend to restrict services using new medical technologies. 
For example, the public financing system in Canada restricts the use of high-tech 
care for patients with AMI relative to US practice ( Cutler 2002 ). 

Public Supply and Financing 
 601
 In addition, a system of direct public provision may use primary care physi-
cians as gatekeepers for the use of medical specialists and hospitals. By contrast, 
private supply systems often give patients an unrestricted choice of providers. In 
such systems, with the exception of some managed care plans, patients can make 
appointments with whichever physicians they wish to see. Further, they can go to 
the hospital emergency room and, depending on their condition, be admitted to 
the hospital as an inpatient without consulting a primary care physician. 
 The lack of a gatekeeper mechanism may lead to high use rates of medical 
specialists and a low use rate of primary care physicians, an inefficient allocation 
of resources. The social marginal cost of specialty care exceeds its social marginal 
benefit, while the social marginal benefit of primary care exceeds its social mar-
ginal cost (  box 13.2 ).  
 Equity 
 In health care, the concept of equity has been widely used in two dimensions: 
financing and delivery. In measuring equity, researchers and policy makers 
commonly accept the principle that health care ought to be financed according to 
ability to pay and distributed according to health needs ( Wagstaff and Van Doors-
laer 1992 ). In practice, equity in the financing of health care is measured in terms 
of vertical equity; that is, individuals or families with unequal ability to pay make 
different contributions. An empirical indicator of equity in health care financing 
is an index of progressivity to measure the extent to which the more affluent pay 
a larger proportion of their incomes on personal health care services than the 
poor do. 
 Wagstaff and van Doorslaer (1992) conducted a ten-country study of health 
care financing systems and compared these countries on the basis of the relative 
burdens borne by persons of different income levels in each country. They com-
pared countries with predominantly tax-financed systems — Denmark, Ireland, Por-
tugal, and the UK; social insurance systems — France, Italy, the Netherlands, and 
Spain; and predominantly private systems — Switzerland and the United States. 
They found that health care financing was progressive in only three of the ten 
countries, all with tax-financed systems — the UK, Ireland, and Portugal. The two 
countries with the most regressive financing structures were the two private ones, 
the United States and Switzerland. Overall, they concluded that tax-financed 
systems tend to be proportional or mildly progressive, social insurance systems are 
regressive, and private systems are the most regressive of all. A study of Asian 
countries found that health care financing was slightly regressive in the three high-
income Asian countries they studied (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan), each of 
which has universal social insurance ( O ’ Donnell, Van Doorslaer, Rannan-Eliya, 
et al. 2008 ), and similar to European countries with similar systems. The same was 
true of Hong Kong, which was similar to high-income countries in Europe. Among

 Is American Health Care Uniquely Inefficient? 
 This chapter described two concepts of efficiency, technical efficiency and allocative 
efficiency. In addition, we mentioned that the United States has spent more on per-
sonal health care services than any country in the world during the past four decades. 
This raises two concerns about the efficiency of US health care expenditures: (1) Does 
US health care display inferior technical efficiency? (2) Is US health care spend-
ing allocatively efficient compared to other countries ’ health care spending?  Garber 
and Skinner (2008)  undertook a comprehensive evaluation to address these two 
questions. 
 With regard to the first concept,  Garber and Skinner (2008)  identified  “ heteroge-
neous demand ” as an important factor accounting for the technical inefficiency in 
the US health care system. Heterogeneous demand is the consequence of differences 
in preferences or income but may also reflect the presence of racial or ethnic dispari-
ties or from regional differences in health care spending. Fragmentation of care arising 
from diversity in the sources of health care financing and insurance coverage in the 
United States leads to lower technical efficiency than would be realized in an egali-
tarian health care system. 
 There are at least three lines of evidence to support this argument. First, the United 
States lags behind most other developed countries in the diffusion of information 
technology. Just 28 percent of primary care physicians in the United States use elec-
tronic health records, compared to 98 percent in the Netherlands and 89 percent in 
the UK. Second, there are a higher percentage of chronically ill persons who experi-
ence access barriers to health care than in other developed countries. About 42 
percent of chronically ill persons failed to adhere to recommended treatments or did 
not take full medication doses because of costs, compared to just five percent in the 
Netherlands and nine percent in the UK. Third, the US health care system also exhib-
its a more pronounced regional variation in per capita Medicare expenditures or in 
highly effective low-cost care (e.g., the use of beta blockers for heart attacks) than 
other developed countries. This suggests that the technical efficiency of health pro-
duction function in the United States would more closely resemble that of other 
developed countries if care were provided more uniformly for people with similar 
clinical characteristics. 
 With regard to allocative efficiency,  Garber and Skinner (2008)  point out the fol-
lowing three factors that contribute to the allocative inefficiency in the US health care 
system: (1) high prices for inputs, (2) lack of incentives for restraining overutilization, 
and (3) a tendency to adopt expensive medical innovations rapidly. One aspect of the 
high prices of health care inputs is that US physicians earn more than physicians in 
most other countries. In addition, the US health care system tends to offer the most 
expensive treatments, such as newer drugs with accompanying higher prices. Fur-
thermore, compared to other developed countries, the United States typically does 
not consider effectiveness relative to its costs in the provision of new health care 
technologies.

poorer countries, more affluent persons paid more relative to other persons in their 
countries with lower incomes, but they also received more services. 
 Another concept of equity is horizontal equity, which is based on the prin-
ciple of equal treatment for equal need.  Van Doorslaer, Wagstaff, van der Burg, 
et al.  (2000) applied this concept in measuring equity in health care utilization in 
ten European countries and the United States. They found that in all countries, the 
lower-income groups were more intensive users of health care services, including 
outpatient visits to general practitioners, medical specialists, and inpatient care. 
However, after controlling for differences in health needs, there was little or no 
evidence of an appreciable inequity in the overall health care utilization. This 
result may have arisen from combining offsetting inequalities in utilization among 
various components of health care. On the one hand, they found that in half of the 
countries sampled, there was a substantial bias toward more affluent persons since 
high-income persons used more physician visits than would be expected on the 
basis of need alone. On the other hand, hospital utilization was much higher among 
low-income persons, even after accounting for differences in needs. Overall, their 
results suggest that in the aggregate, health care systems of ten European countries 
and the United States performed reasonably well in terms of horizontal equity 
measured as equal treatment for equal need, although there were some exceptions 
for some specific components of health care.

 Summary 
 This chapter has analyzed major economic issues surrounding the health system 
with public supply and financing. We first explained the rationale for public 
financing  and  provision based on the argument that health care outcomes are non-
contractible. Under such circumstances, public provision may be more efficient 
than private supply if the adverse effect of cost reduction on noncontractible 
quality under the latter is sufficiently large and innovation in health care is not a 
major contributor to quality improvement. We then explained the rationale for this 
system from the vantage point of redistribution. In this respect, public provision 
of health care is advantageous in achieving equal access through income 
redistribution. 
 We then analyzed the effects of public provision using the UK ’ s NHS as an 
example. The NHS rations health care resources by queues rather than by prices. 
For this reason, our discussion focused on the role of waiting lists. Optimal waiting 
list length depends on the marginal cost and the marginal benefit of waiting, the 
latter of which in turn varies by disease type. We also reviewed several empirical 
studies on estimating the cost of waiting lists. The cost of waiting ranged from 0.5 
percent to 0.8 percent of GDP in the UK. Increases in NHS waiting lists are associ-
ated with increases in private health insurance purchases.

 Part III / Chapter 13
 Public provision is especially common in low-income countries. While cer-
tainly not the only causal determinant of low quality of care, public systems 
in these contexts often have not provided sufficient oversight or monitoring of 
service provision. Furthermore, incentives to encourage clinicians to provide ade-
quate quality of care have often been lacking. We documented the evidence from 
empirical studies of the issue that have been conducted to date and discussed 
policy options that might be implemented for improving the quality of care provi-
sion. Only one of the options involves privatizing the delivery of health care 
services. 
 There is a paucity of empirical evidence on the effects of policy interventions 
to improve the quality of care in low-income countries. We reviewed two recent 
interesting randomized controlled trials of interventions to help consumers as 
individuals and collectively demand improvements in quality. The results of both 
studies are encouraging. 
 Finally, we evaluated different health care systems in terms of intermediate 
performance measures and performance goals. Intermediate performance measures, 
such as access, cost, and quality, do not always, or even generally, move in the 
same direction. Rather, there are many trade-offs between intermediate perfor-
mance measures. Specifically, there is a trade-off between access and cost because 
achieving better access to care requires more resources and hence increases the 
cost burden to society. There is also a trade-off between cost and quality. There is 
no perfect system that has an advantage in achieving all of the intermediate per-
formance measures. Without comparing costs and outcomes, it is not possible to 
draw definitive conclusions on the relative efficiency of alternative health care 
systems. Although cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis has been widely used 
for comparisons at the disease level or program level, empirical evidence on the 
efficiency of alternative health care systems at a national level is nonexistent. 
Hence we are unable to draw definitive conclusions about the overall performance 
of different health care systems. 
 Nevertheless, there are some consistent patterns. First, systems with public 
financing are in a better position to achieve the goal of equity in the health care 
financing, especially when tax financing plays the dominant role. Second, a system 
with a larger share of public financing appears to be better at controlling growth 
in overall expenditure on personal health care services. Thus, a system with public 
financing has a comparative advantage in obtaining an optimal balance among dif-
ferent policy goals. 
 By contrast, the case for the public supply of health care seems weaker 
because there is no consistent evidence showing that this system is in a better 
position to achieve a good balance among competing goals. Quality has been judged 
to be low in some public systems. Incentives provided by market forces to innovate 
may be lacking in public systems. While queuing may redistribute services to low-
income persons, there is a deadweight loss from queuing. 

Public Supply and Financing 
 605
 Health systems characterized by the combination of public financing and 
private supply of health care are thus likely to become the most common model 
as a result of worldwide health care reform, although such a system must wrestle 
with the trade-off among different measures of performance, such as cost contain-
ment, quality, and innovation in health care.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 13.1  
 What are the major advantages and disadvantages of the public provision of 
personal health care services? Under what conditions is public provision 
likely to be the preferred mode of delivery? 
 13.2  
 What are some of the disadvantages of the public provision of personal 
health care services? Identify the most important trade-offs in a country ’ s 
decision between public versus private provision. 
 13.3  
 Describe the concept of an optimal waiting list. Why would this vary by 
disease? What are the key costs of waiting? 
 13.4  
 Distinguish between the concepts of horizontal and vertical equity. Describe 
specific indicators that can be used to evaluate horizontal and vertical equity 
of a health system. 

606 
 Part III / Chapter 13
 13.5 
 One rationale for the public provision of health care is that the public sector 
is better at achieving society ’ s redistributive concerns. How does a govern-
ment redistribute income by providing health care directly? 
 13.6 
 What is meant by the term  “ heterogeneity among individuals ” ? Give three 
examples in which heterogeneity among individuals creates a gap between 
the public supply of and the private demand for health care (i.e., some 
individuals may have an unmet want in the public health system). 
 13.7 
 Explain the term  “ noncontractible outcomes ” in your own words. Noncon-
tractible outcomes do not only pertain to health care. Explain how noncon-
tractible outcomes may operate in markets for long-term care and in the 
government procurement of defense weapons. 
 13.8 
 Based on the theory of noncontractible outcomes, what are two precondi-
tions that must be met for public provision to be superior to private 
provision? 
 13.9 
 What is meant by the term  “ opt out of the public system ” ? Give two exam-
ples of opting out the public system in markets other than for health care, 
and explain the rationale for each choice 
 13.10  Why is a waiting list for receiving health services very common in systems 
where the government provides health care directly but not so common in 
other health care systems? 
 13.11  The long waiting list has been the major issue in public health systems for 
decades. Can the government solve this issue solely by increasing health 
care budgets? If so, please explain under what conditions raising public 
funds can become an effective policy to ease the problem of waiting lists. 
 13.12  Define  “ equity ” in health care financing. Based on the existing evidence, 
which type of health care system is in a better position to achieve equity in 
health care financing? Justify your answer. 
 Exercises 
 13.1  For which of the following services is public supply likely to be superior to 
private supply? Discuss each service and justify your answers. 
 a.  prison; 
 b.  schooling; 
 c.  vaccination; 
 d.   housing. 

Public Supply and Financing

 13.2   In chapter 12, we introduced social insurance programs in many countries. 
All these countries have incorporated various forms of demand-side cost sharing, 
such as coinsurance or co-payments, into their health systems. But in the public 
health systems discussed in this chapter, it is rare to see countries adopting demand-
side cost sharing. What is the reason for this difference? 
 13.3   Collect data on GDP per capita and percentage of out-of-pocket payment in 
total health expenditures for at least twenty countries from any data set you can 
access (e.g., OECD Health Data or the World Health Organization ’ s World Health 
Report for 2006). If you cannot access any data set, you may use the data on these 
two variables from   figures 13.5 and 13.6  to answer the questions. Plot the data, 
with GDP per capita on the horizontal axis and percentage of out-of-pocket payment 
on the vertical axis, and answer the following questions: 
 a.  Based on your figure, is there any clear relationship between GDP per capita 
and percentage of out-of-pocket payment? If so, does the relationship have a 
negative or a positive slope? How do you interpret such a relationship? 
 b.  Did any country become an outlier in your figure? How do you explain this 
exception? 
 13.4   According to a study conducted by the World Bank, around 50 percent of 
health care financing in sub-Saharan Africa comes from out-of-pocket payments 
paid by largely impoverished populations. Assume that the World Bank calls for 
a proposal to solve this problem and receives two policy recommendations: one 
suggests a  “ public solution ” through the direct public provision that requires the 
governments in these countries to allocate more funds to public hospitals; the other 
suggests a  “ private solution ” through private health insurance that requires the 
governments in African countries to encourage the development of the private 
health insurance market. The World Bank hires you as an expert to review these 
two proposals. What are your main comments on these two proposals from the 
vantage points of efficiency and equity? 
 13.5   In recent years, government revenues from taxing tobacco and selling lottery 
tickets have been widely used to finance health care provision and services. 
Suppose both China and India were to adopt a major health care reform to reduce 
their citizens ’ share of out-of-pocket payment in total health expenditure, but each 
country decides to use a different funding source. China uses a tobacco tax and the 
net revenue from selling lottery tickets as the source of public funds; India uses 
the personal income tax as its source of public funds. Assume that other aspects 
remain constant. Compare the equity in health care financing between these two 
countries. 

608 
 Part III / Chapter 13
 13.6  In chapters 11 – 13, we have provided reviews of the evolution of health care 
systems in more than ten countries. Among them, which country has had a rela-
tively  “ stable ” health system that has not changed appreciably for a very long time, 
and which country has had a relatively  “ unstable ”  health care system that has 
changed frequently during a short time period? Why is the health system in some 
countries more stable than in other countries? List at least two factors contributing 
to the stability of a health care system and at least two factors contributing to the 
instability of a health care system. 
 13.7  Many countries have a  “ mixed ”  health care system, that is, a private health 
care sector exists alongside a larger public health care sector. Under such a system, 
individuals may choose to  “ opt out ” of the public system and receive care from 
private sources. Does this opting-out behavior occur more frequently in low-income 
countries than in high-income countries? Why or why not? Do the major drivers 
that induce people to opt out the public system differ between high-income and 
low-income countries?

 Cost and Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis 
 Up to now, this book has largely dealt with positive economics — explaining why 
behaviors are observed, including the role of incentives in the decisions made in 
a health care context. In the next two chapters we focus on normative economic 
questions. Answers to normative questions involve recommendations about poli-
cies that should be adopted. There are many normative questions in the health care 
sphere. Here we deal with recommendations about the allocation of health care 
resources. Which personal health care services should be provided, and under what 
circumstances? If resources were unlimited, it would be unnecessary to have 
methods for determining the best way to allocate resources. 
 Decision makers — governments, insurers, individuals, physicians, and oth-
ers — make choices about resource allocation on some basis. Some decision makers 
may rely on their past professional and personal experiences or on material they 
learned in school. Physicians and other health professionals may follow rules and 
guidelines developed by others. On the other hand, they may follow the advice of 
drug sales personnel who visit them in their offices. Government decision makers 
may be influenced by precedent or by budget constraints, even if the budget con-
straints are  “ soft ” (see chapter 6), as well as by political pressures from self-
interested stakeholders, in making resource allocation decisions. 
 Although the economist ’ s prescription for optimal resource allocation involves 
comparisons of benefits and costs, decisions often focus almost exclusively on 
either costs or benefits or on neither costs nor benefits. In the end, public decisions 
are political. This does not mean, however, that there is no role for the economic 
analysis of resource allocation decisions. Even if the decision is eventually guided 
by political considerations, decision makers often want to know the results of 

618 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
quantitative analyses of the costs and benefits of a particular choice. The task of 
the analyst is to provide unbiased advice based on the best evidence available. The 
public official then can weigh the evidence provided along with other consider-
ations in reaching a final decision. 
 Unfortunately, the advice sought or obtained is often incomplete, which 
inevitably leads to poor resource allocation decisions. For example, because costs 
are highly visible and often immediate while benefits are less visible, more diffuse, 
and often accrue over a long period of time, decisions to cover the cost of a specific 
drug may be largely based on the cost of the drug, even if the drug has important 
benefits. Sometimes the use of a drug reduces other costs, such as from hospitaliza-
tions, which have favorable effects on the decision maker ’ s budget. However, 
without analysis, these favorable impacts may not be identified. 
 At the other extreme, some public policy makers and manufacturers of 
medical products focus exclusively on the benefits of a technology; an example 
here is government agencies with responsibility for regulating the safety and effi-
cacy of prescription drugs. In some cases, public agencies are not allowed to con-
sider cost in their decision making. Some private insurers are not much different. 
They cover drugs if the drugs are deemed to be safe and effective, sometimes impos-
ing a higher co-payment rate on branded versus generic drugs, with no explicit 
consideration given to the quantitative benefits of the drug. 
 This chapter and the following one describe analytic techniques to guide 
decisions that reflect not only costs or benefits, each taken independently, but costs 
and benefits of specific technologies evaluated jointly. While it would be naive to 
presume that decision makers will use these analytic techniques to the total exclu-
sion of other considerations in decision making, use of these techniques can add 
both consistency and rigor to the decision-making process, which can lead to a 
better allocation of scarce resources. 
 The methodologies we describe assume a social perspective. Both social 
benefits and costs are considered. Social benefits include not only benefits to the 
user of a particular technology but any benefits accruing to others from its use. 
Similarly, social costs include costs accruing to all parties, not just the user and 
the user ’ s family. An individual family member or an insurer may adopt a narrower 
perspective on benefit and cost. An insurer may not be concerned about the cost 
burdens on families, and conversely. 
 14.1 
 Overview of Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-
Benefit Analysis 
 Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) assesses cost per unit of outcome, such as cost 
per life years saved, cost per quality-adjusted life year saved (QALY) (see chapter 
7), or cost per accident averted. A QALY is a measure of the quality as well as the 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 619
quantity of life. It measures the number of life years, but with the life years adjusted 
downward to the extent that people are limited in terms of mental health, pain, 
and physical or cognitive functioning during these years. Thus, for example, a 
technology might extend life by five years, but because persons suffer severe dis-
ability during these years, the technology may raise QALYs by only one or two 
units. 
 Costs are calculated in monetary units. Outcomes in CEA are not expressed 
in monetary terms but rather in such units as life years, QALYs, and nonfatal acci-
dents averted. In comparing different alternatives for achieving the same type of 
outcome, the task is to select that alternative with the lowest cost per unit 
of outcome. When comparing alternative preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
approaches with different outcomes, such as lives saved versus days of work lost 
versus improvements in the physical functioning of elderly persons who are not 
employed in the workforce, the decision maker needs to weigh the relative impor-
tance of each outcome type in some way for a comparison to be made. QALYs offer 
an explicit approach for making comparisons when the units of output for various 
technologies differ. For example, QALYs permit comparisons of benefits from a 
drug designed to reduce migraine headaches with a vaccine aimed at preventing 
HIV/AIDS. 
 In cost-benefit analysis (CBA), both costs and benefits are expressed in mon-
etary units. Thus, the ratio of costs to benefits or the difference in benefits and 
costs is compared. Such analysis is often used in some public policy areas, such 
as in resource and environmental decision making. In the health area, CEA is far 
more commonly used than CBA. 
 The advantages of CEA, described in this chapter, and CBA, described in 
chapter 15, are that such analyses provide (1) a framework for making underlying 
assumptions explicit, (2) a common methodology that facilitates making benefit 
versus cost comparisons among various technologies, and (3) an approach for 
assessing the far-reaching consequences of adopting a technology or implementing 
a health program. Many technologies and programs have impacts on personal 
health that persist for years if not decades. 
 For example, a knee replacement may improve a person ’ s physical function-
ing for several years, but eventually a reoperation may be necessary. A through 
assessment involves calculating cost and benefit streams over a number of years. 
These intertemporal calculations are likely to be difficult for decision makers 
to make in their heads, but to date, the intuitive approach has been the more 
common one. 
 As will become more apparent later, CBA and CEA have important deficien-
cies as well. The quality of the empirical evidence that goes into the models used 
in such analyses varies. For example, a drug may be more effective in some popu-
lations than in others, or adverse side effects may differ. Thus, even if a new drug 
is cost-effective on average, its cost-effectiveness may vary appreciably among 
individuals. 

620 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
 Although in principle, both long- and short-run costs and benefits should be 
considered, in practice, long-run costs and benefits often are not known. The ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) used to assess drug or medical device safety and 
efficacy for regulatory purposes do not typically measure long-term effects. Then, 
even if the studies are well conducted, decision makers may not have adequate 
technical knowledge to assess the studies ’ quality. And even though the study has 
a social perspective, the decision may be based on narrower criteria that are more 
relevant to the decision maker. 
 CEA measures benefits in terms of a change in a clinical outcome, such as 
mortality, blood pressure, time to recurrence of a type of cancer, or QALYs. In a 
CEA, the cost may be only that of the technology itself, such as the cost of a drug. 
In CBA, benefits are measured in pecuniary terms, such as the value of additional 
years of life. In both CEA and CBA, the costs of the intervention are in the numera-
tor of the ratio. The outcomes (CEA) or benefits (CBA) are in the denominator. 
 Economists generally prefer CBA to CEA. Ultimately, resource allocation 
involves comparisons in monetary terms ( Pauly 1996 ). Even a family deciding on 
gifts to purchase for holidays or birthdays has to allocate resources based on costs 
and benefits in monetary terms or some other common unit of measure. How else 
can one compare an expenditure on a scarf versus a toy? Expenditure per gift will 
probably not do. Keeping warm and being entertained need to be expressed explic-
itly or at least implicitly in some common metric, such as money. For reasons that 
are difficult to explain, resource allocation decisions for environmental protection 
generally rely on CBA, even though health effects are among the most important 
targets of environmental policy. 
 Others, including many physicians, prefer CEA. Health professionals are 
often reluctant to place a pecuniary value on good health, a life year, or a life. 
Also, there is a concern that valuing outcomes in pecuniary terms will result in 
resource allocation that favors the affluent over less affluent individuals. Suppose, 
for example, affluent people have high relative willingness to pay for beauty-
enhancing plastic surgery. There is perhaps a risk that a society that bases decisions 
about the allocation of its resources completely on CBA would allocate too many 
resources to such procedures. This is so since benefit may be measured as the sum 
of maximum willingness to pay for the service by all members of society; maximum 
willingness to pay on the part of relatively affluent persons may represent a dis-
proportionate part of total willingness to pay and hence of total benefit. On the 
other hand, decision makers could examine an allocation priority list developed 
from CBA and cull those projects that seem disproportionately influenced by pref-
erences of the country ’ s most affluent citizens. 
 To further illustrate the concern that the use of CBA may discriminate against 
the poor, suppose there are two types of care, a prenatal visit and a surgical pro-
cedure to remove facial hair, and the decision is whether or not a public insurer 
should include these services as benefits. To determine social benefit, we add the 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 621
maximum willingness of each individual to pay for coverage of each service. Person 
A, who has a low income, is willing to pay up to $15 for coverage for a prenatal 
visit and $5 for coverage of facial hair removal. Person B, who is affluent, is willing 
to pay up to $20 for coverage of a prenatal visit and up to $800 for facial hair 
removal. In this two-person economy, the aggregate benefit of the prenatal visit is 
$35, and coverage for facial hair removal is worth $805. Hence, based on aggregate 
benefit, covering facial hair removal merits a higher priority, even though person 
A would have preferred to have coverage for a prenatal visit. 
 Benefits in CBA can be measured in several alternative ways: (1) revealed 
preference data, which provide evidence on choices people actually make, for 
example, revealed choices such as wage premiums when employees take riskier 
jobs or the amount people pay for safety devices such as radon detectors, which 
offer specific reductions in the probability of getting lung cancer from radon located 
in or under one ’ s home; (2) surveys of willingness to pay for reductions in specific 
risks, sometimes called contingent valuation (CV) surveys (because the surveys 
elicit maximum willingness to pay for goods or services contingent on those goods 
or services being offered); or (3) the costs averted by use of the technology, such 
as reductions in spending on hospitalizations. 
 Maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for a year of additional life or for an 
additional QALY, or for coverage of prenatal care or removal of facial hair, is likely 
to be positively related to the individual ’ s income and wealth. And the benefit from 
a good or service being evaluated reflects the sum of all members of society ’ s WTP. 
Advocates for CBA argue that it is possible to reweigh benefits by income category 
or on other basis to reflect society ’ s values regarding the appropriate distribution 
of income ( Pauly 1996 ). Even if we accept the arguments for CBA as valid, CEA is 
so much more common that it has become the standard method used in health care 
technology evaluation. 
 CBA or CEA is not needed for the vast majority of decisions we make in daily 
life. The consumer decides how much ice cream to purchase without performing 
a formal analysis of benefits versus cost and the time stream over which such 
benefits and cost accrue. For example, ice cream may be tasty now but lead to 
obesity later, and to diabetes even later. In this sense, a CBA or CEA prior to the 
ice cream consumption decision may be good to have, but most people would think 
they could decide such matters without employing CBA or CEA as a decision-
making tool. 
 But consider a decision by a public agency about whether or not to cover an 
oral medication for glycemic (blood sugar) control of diabetes. The adoption deci-
sion involves a collective choice, not an individual decision. The public decision 
maker should consider the benefits and costs that individual decision makers 
would not. Much of the cost of future diabetes complications will be financed by 
the public insurer, not by the individual with the diabetic complication. Long-run 
effects or multiple effects are often difficult for one patient or even one physician, 

622 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
based on his or her practice experience, to evaluate, especially when the effects 
occur only very rarely. An individual physician may have prescribed the drugs for 
years and never observed a patient with a particular adverse effect. However, such 
rarely occurring adverse effects can be incorporated into formal analysis of the 
technology ’ s costs and benefits using larger samples than a single physician ’ s prac-
tice would be likely to yield. 
 14.2 
 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Measuring Cost 
 Overview 
 The objective of cost measurement in CEA is to estimate the cost of the interven-
tion net of savings if there are cost offsets accruing from the intervention. Cost 
offsets represent savings attributable to reductions in the use of some services 
attributable to the intervention other than the intervention itself. For example, the 
intervention might be a new drug and the cost offset might be reduced hospital 
stays among persons taking the drug. 
 At first glance, measuring cost might seem quite straightforward. However, a 
number of complexities are involved, starting with the concept of opportunity cost 
and its measurement. Some costs can be measured from market values, such as the 
wage of a hospital employee. For other types of cost for which no market value is 
available, we must find some method for imputing the cost, such as the cost of 
patient waiting time, particularly when the patient is not employed. And, as we 
shall see, not all costs are relevant for computing a cost-effectiveness ratio. 
 Concept of Opportunity Cost 
 Essential to the economic concept of cost is  opportunity cost . Deploying a good or 
a service in one activity usually means reducing its use in some other activity. If 
there is no reduction in input use because, for example, some units of the input 
would not be utilized in any case, the input use has a zero opportunity cost. Thus, 
for example, if a hospital has unutilized beds, allocating some of these unutilized 
beds to a new activity does not involve an opportunity cost. The beds must have 
alternative uses that generate value. If the hospital operates at full capacity, raising 
admissions of persons with one health condition must mean a decrease in admis-
sions of another type. In the latter case, treating one type of patient has an oppor-
tunity cost in not being able to treat another type of patient because of bed capacity 
constraints. 
 Many CEAs in health care are done to inform decisions about drugs and 
medical devices. The meaning of the opportunity cost in each application depends 
on the decision being made. If the decision is whether or not to make a public 
investment in research and development for a drug for a particular disease, the 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 623
relevant opportunity cost includes the cost of R & D, as well as the additional cost 
of manufacturing and distributing the drug. R & D requires the work of scientists, 
technicians, materials, and attorneys (e.g., to obtain patents), which if used for one 
drug is not available for other uses. Manufacturing and distribution requires these 
labor inputs, but in different combinations, such as storage facilities, transport, and 
other inputs. The costs of administering the drug are also relevant opportunity 
costs. However, when R & D is involved, the main cost is likely to be for R & D (see 
chapter 9). 
 By contrast, if the public decision maker in a country is considering inclusion 
of a drug on the country ’ s health insurance plan ’ s formulary (a list of drugs covered 
by the insurance plan), a drug that already has been invented and marketed else-
where, then the relevant opportunity cost includes the cost of the drug to its health 
insurance plan. This will depend on the price the plan can negotiate, as well as 
the number of units the plan expects to purchase in a time period, such as a year. 
 Direct and Indirect Costs 
 In much of the literature on the economic evaluation of drugs and other medical 
technology, a distinction is made between  direct and  indirect costs. Direct costs 
include the value of all goods and services consumed in the provision of the tech-
nology, both the resources used in the program and those used in treating the 
adverse side effects of the technology or program, present and future. An example 
of a program ’ s adverse effects is the cost of relocating people displaced from a 
contaminated site. Included in direct costs are all health care costs, as well as such 
non-health care costs as child care utilized when parents visit a doctor, the cost of 
transportation to clinics (presumably not on buses with empty seats), and the value 
of the patient ’ s time lost from work while receiving the technology, such as a phy-
sician visit. 
 Not all direct costs need be positive. For example, although the direct cost of 
a drug is plausibly positive, if use of the drug results in savings in physician visits 
or in hospital stays, these cost offsets would enter the cost calculation (the numera-
tor of the cost-effectiveness ratio) as negative values. 
 Indirect costs include lost output due to illness, either in terms of missed 
work or lower productivity on the job or in terms of inability to perform household 
tasks. Indirect costs are legitimate costs; in fact, they are as legitimate as the direct 
ones. Thus, the distinction is not really very meaningful, although the distinction 
is often made. They are all costs. 
 In CBA, reductions in indirect costs are likely to be considered part of ben-
efits. Other costs such as those attributable to pain and suffering and mortality 
are generally not included as indirect costs, but they too affect consumer 
welfare and merit inclusion in cost-benefit calculations. Since such costs are non-
pecuniary, they present unique measurement issues, to be described in the next 
chapter. 

624 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
 Other Cost Concepts 
 Transfer Costs 
 A transfer payment, such as the payment of a fixed amount per unit of time (e.g., 
a day) to a person suffering from an illness or disability, is not a cost from society ’ s 
perspective. It is a cost to the party making the transfer and a benefit to the party 
receiving it. However, except for the administrative cost of determining eligibility 
and making the transfer (e.g., writing and recording the check and sending it), the 
transfer per se involves no use of scarce resources and hence is not a social cost 
and not a cost considered in CEA. Transfer of money places purchasing power in 
different hands, but increases in the recipient ’ s purchasing power are offset by 
reductions in the donor ’ s/taxpayer ’ s purchasing power. By contrast, the public 
provision of goods and services does involve the use of scarce resources, and hence 
the cost of such public provision is counted in CEA. 
 Future Costs 
 Future costs associated with the use of a technology are as legitimate as current 
ones. Many technologies involve future costs. For example, artificial knees wear 
out and need to be replaced. Cardiac pacemakers require regular monitoring; bat-
teries wear out and must be replaced periodically. Many drugs require regular 
monitoring by physicians to check for adverse health effects. 
 Future costs are worth less than currently occurring costs in that future costs 
are discounted to present value (discussed in chapter 2). The effect discounting 
has on the present value of future costs depends on the discount rate used. If the 
social rate of time preference is high — that is, if consumption today is worth much 
more to people than the same amount of consumption at a later time — society is 
relatively present-oriented, and conversely for a low time preference. When time 
preference is high, future benefits and costs receive low weight relative to ones 
accruing closer to the present. 
 Determining the appropriate social rate of time preference or the  discount 
rate  is not straightforward. If the rate selected is too low, future costs will be over-
stated, and conversely if the rate selected is too high. The social discount rate 
should be a real rate; the social rate is the nominal social discount rate less annual 
rates of inflation. For example, if the anticipated inflation rate is 4 percent annu-
ally, then a nominal discount rate of 6 percent corresponds to a real rate of 2 
percent. Unless deflation (price declines) is anticipated, real discount rates must 
be positive values. 
 Real social discount rates should generally be less than or equal to real market 
interest rates. There are several reasons for this. First, market rates reflect credit 
and market risk. Governments ’ central banks that issue their own currency face no 
credit risk, although market risk, which applies to all securities, remains. Second, 
societies have a longer time horizon than do consumers or other private parties. 
For example, an individual may attach less weight to outcomes accruing in future 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 625
decades than societies do. Of course, public officials may be worried about the next 
election and have high rates of time preference (high discount rates) for this reason. 
The long-run real return on US government long-term fixed income securities, 
measured from 1870 to 2004, was 2.96 percent ( Girola 2005 ). For a shorter period, 
1961 – 2004, the yield on such securities was 3.44 percent, compared with 3.20 
percent on the US Social Security Trust Fund ( Girola 2005 ). It seems unlikely that 
the social discount rate is higher than a weighted average of these two long-run 
rates, if that high. 
 Some analysts add a factor to discount rates to reflect the uncertainty of their 
calculations. This approach may represent a conservative method for accounting 
for uncertainty when the costs are incurred initially and the benefits accrue later, 
since the conservative approach would reduce benefits relative to costs. But in 
CEA, costs are in the numerator of the cost-effectiveness ratio.  1 Unless substantial 
cost offsets occur downstream, introducing a  “ fudge factor ” into the discount rate 
to reflect uncertainty is not a conservative approach, particularly when costs are 
incurred downstream. Particularly for chronic diseases, for example, it may be 
necessary to take the drug on an ongoing basis. Then using the fudge factor would 
understate the present value of costs accruing downstream. Other methods for 
taking account of uncertainty are described below. 
 Future costs present some additional conceptual issues. For example, suppose 
a drug raises the probability that a person will survive a heart attack. Should one 
include the future costs of food, housing, and medicine as a future cost? Or do 
measures of willingness to pay for an additional life year, discussed below, account 
for the benefit of living longer net of the cost of maintaining the person during that 
life year? 
 Sunk versus Incremental Costs 
 A sunk cost is a cost incurred irrespective of whether the good or service is con-
sumed or not. For example, after a drug has been invented and marketed, whether 
or not the drug is used, there is the sunk cost of the investment in R & D that led to 
availability of the drug. The cost of a hospital plant and equipment is sunk if there 
are no alternative uses for the facility. 
 Incremental cost, by contrast, depends on the level of output. If another unit 
is produced, distributed, and consumed, additional cost is incurred. Whether or 
not a cost is sunk or incremental depends on the decision being made. If the deci-
sion is made to invest in drug R & D, the cost of R & D is incremental. If a decision 
is made whether or not to cover a drug for an additional medical condition, the 
R & D investment on that drug is likely to be a sunk cost. Sunk costs are not appro-
priate for inclusion in CEA (or CBA) calculations. 
 Joint Costs/Joint Production 
 Joint production occurs everywhere. In a company producing several products, 
much labor and capital are frequently devoted to manufacturing and distributing 
1.  In CEA, the 
denominator represents 
some measure of health 
out come, such as 
number of life years 
saved. Discounting 
these values at a higher 
rate would increase the 
cost-effectiveness ratio, 
making the activity 
being evaluated appear 
to be less worth while.

more than one product. Suppose a company produces cameras and film. How 
should the salary of the company ’ s president be allocated? There is an almost 
infinite number of ways in which the president ’ s salary could be allocated to the 
various company products, including cameras and film. One approach would be 
to base the allocation on the square feet allocated to the production of each good. 
Another would be to allocate the CEO ’ s salary based on relative sales of the differ-
ent products. Or the company could perform a time-and-motion study (direct 
observation of how time is spent on various activities) to determine how the presi-
dent ’ s time is allocated. But this approach will not result in an accurate allocation 
either since the president ’ s time may often involve more than a single product, for 
example, time spent deciding whether or not to market several of the company ’ s 
products in a particular part of a country or to particular countries. 
 The economist ’ s solution (to continue this example) is that the company 
should consider only the value of the  additional  time spent by the president if the 
company were to increase its output for one product by a unit. Economists ’ focus 
is on marginal cost, not on allocating total or average cost by some measure of 
product share. If raising output by a unit does not increase the president ’ s use of 
time, there is no additional such cost to count. But any additional cost arising from 
output increases  should be counted. In practice, it is often difficult to estimate 
marginal cost, even for those who have access to information inside the company. 
 Cost from Alternative Perspectives 
 The societal perspective, the perspective from which cost for the purposes of con-
ducting CEAs should be measured, is only one of several alternative perspectives. 
Others include those of the patient and patient ’ s family, the self-insured employer, 
the public or private insurer, the managed care plan, or the hospital, physician, or 
pharmaceutical manufacturer. Perspective makes a substantial difference to which 
costs are considered. A societal perspective incorporates all costs and benefits to 
whomever they accrue. 
 However, in making personal decisions about health care use and other per-
sonal resource allocation decisions, the patient would have a different perspective
 — a valid one from the patient ’ s vantage point. The individual patient is likely to 
consider only his or her opportunity cost of time and the costs he or she incurs 
out of pocket. The employer that provides health insurance to its employees on a 
self-insured basis is likely to consider patient time only if it adversely affects time 
away from the workplace for physician visits, paid sick time, and associated admin-
istrative costs, such as finding substitutes for the worker ’ s lost work time. A private 
health insurer might not consider the value of sick time at all. Of course, a private 
insurer might become interested if it was clear that demand for its insurance 
product was affected by the success of the health plan in reducing employee sick 
days. While in principle, a public insurer ’ s decisions would be guided by a con-
sideration of social costs and benefits, in practice, public insurers may have a more 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 627
limited perspective. For example, public insurers may be subject to pressure from 
politicians most directly and from taxpayers indirectly through their pressure on 
politicians to constrain the program ’ s expenditure growth. Thus, even if a new 
technology were to reduce sick time, since public insurers do not compensate for 
sick time or otherwise bear the cost of sick time, such cost may not seem germane 
to the insurer ’ s decision-making process. While we would argue that such cost 
should be germane, more realistically, even public decision makers often have more 
narrowly defined perspectives. 
 Having discussed the numerator of the cost-effectiveness ratio, we now 
describe its denominator. 
 14.3 
 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Measuring 
Effectiveness 
 Effectiveness versus Efficacy 
 Health care analysts distinguish between  effectiveness and  efficacy .  Efficacy  refers 
to the input ’ s marginal product under ideal circumstances. Circumstances are ideal 
when the technology is used exactly as it is designed to be used, for example, by 
patients in an RCT, or by physicians after the technology is introduced into the 
market. In practice, technologies are not used exactly as prescribed; they are often 
prescribed to persons who do not have the same condition for which the technol-
ogy was designed. Patients often do not adhere to physicians ’ recommendations. 
Or patients have other conditions in addition to the condition for which the tech-
nology was designed. Efficacy refers to the relationship between inputs and outputs 
in an idealized laboratory setting, or under idealized conditions, which prevail in 
an RCT. 
 By contrast,  effectiveness  refers to the input ’ s (technology ’ s) marginal product 
in  actual  use. For example, a drug may be ideally suited for patients with a speci-
fied set of characteristics, and the RCT may be limited to samples of patients with 
these same characteristics. In practice, the drug may be used more widely, for a 
broader set of indications or for patients with other characteristics, such as patients 
with other diagnoses or patients who fall outside the age range included in the 
RCT. Therefore, effectiveness may fall short of the drug ’ s efficacy or conversely if 
the drug is used for more indications than for which it is officially approved. Since 
in the real world, drugs and other technologies are used in ways physicians and 
their patients want to use them, effectiveness is the relevant concept for CEA (and 
CBA) calculations. 
 The first step in measuring effectiveness is to select the appropriate measure 
or measures of output or outcome. In CEA, these outputs or outcomes are often 
called  endpoints . The next step is to actually measure the marginal product of the 
technology. 

628 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
 Endpoints 
 The most objective endpoint or outcome measure is survival (mortality). Drugs, 
diagnostic tests, devices, surgical procedures, and hospitalizations all may affect 
the probability of surviving to certain dates in the future. For technologies that are 
largely designed to be life-saving, such as an emergency response system or an 
implantable cardiac defibrillator, survival is a very appropriate endpoint. 
 A defibrillator is a device that sends shocks to the heart to return heartbeats 
to normal rhythm. Serious abnormal rhythm can lead to death. The value one 
attaches to a life saved depends in part on how long the person would live if he 
or she did not die from an abnormal heart rhythm. For this reason, the number of 
life years saved may be a better metric than the number of lives saved. Such devices 
sometimes fire when a person ’ s rhythm is not that abnormal or fail to fire when 
they should. Regardless of its accuracy, firing is painful to the wearer. Such intan-
gible costs are generally not incorporated into a CEA calculation, although they 
would generally be included in a CBA. 
 A second global endpoint measure is the QALY. A QALY is assigned a weight 
between 0 and 1 to each time period, where 1 signifies perfect health and 0, death. 
Since QALYs or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are in widespread use, espe-
cially in applications of CEA, we describe them in some detail. 
 The psychological approach to measuring QALYs involves the use of rating 
scales and magnitude estimation. One rating scale method starts with the descrip-
tion of a case involving illness or disability. People are asked to rate the severity 
of the condition on a 0 – 10 scale where 0 is for death and 10 is for optimal function 
( Kaplan 1995 , 37). 
 Magnitude estimation is a psychometric method. An interviewer or interview 
instrument describes a case in terms of a person ’ s health, functioning, and quality 
of life, and assigns a specific value to the case, say 6. Then survey respondents are 
asked to rate other cases relative to the standard case — higher or lower than 6. If, 
for example, survey respondents regard a case as half as desirable as the compara-
tor, it is assigned a value of 3 ( Kaplan 1995 , 39). After the data have been collected, 
the researcher can rescale responses to a 0 – 1 interval or to any other interval the 
researcher desires. 
 A deficiency of these types of methods is that they do not force the respondent 
to perform explicit trade-offs in rating. There is no cost to consistently assigning 
high or low values when rating. Without a cost of doing so, respondents can say 
that all the options are good or bad or highly valued or of low value. 
 An alternative approach that does require the evaluator to make a trade-off 
is the  standard gamble  (see chapter 2). The concept of a standard gamble is based 
on the theory of decision making under uncertainty (  fig. 14.1 ). The interview gives 
the respondent two options. The first is to do nothing, which implies that circum-
stances will play out a certain way in the future. The alternative is to make a deci-
sion to undertake a certain action that, if successful, leads to an improvement over 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 629
the projected trajectory from the  “ do nothing ” option. However, there is a non-zero 
probability that the action, if undertaken, will not be successful, in which case the 
person is worse off than if he or she did nothing.  
 For example, after experiencing pain when walking, suppose a physician told 
you that you have an injury to your spinal cord, which will lead to an inability to 
walk. The benefit of the operation is that you will be able to walk normally and 
painlessly. However, the operation itself entails risks, and a certain percentage of 
people who undergo this operation die during surgery. The choice then is between 
two unpleasant alternatives, living a life of immobility or making a decision that 
may result in a cure or in a sudden, if painless, death. 
 Define  U d as utility in the state of disability and  U h as utility in the healthy 
state, that is, without the disability. Assume that utility in the dead state is 0. 
Let   Θ be the probability that the person does not survive the operation. 
 Then for  U d = (1  –  Θ ) U h , the decision maker is indifferent between having 
and not having the operation since 1  –  Θ is the probability of surviving the opera-
tion, being cured, and realizing utility  U h . The object of the standard gamble 
approach is to find the  Θ ,  Θ *, the probability of dying during surgery, that makes 
the person indifferent between undergoing and not undergoing the operation. Once 
 Θ * has been elicited, and given that  U h = 1.0 by assumption, we have an estimate 
of the value of  U d . The ratio  U d / U h provides an estimate of a QALY for a person 
with this illness type and extent of disability. 
 The underlying logic is that when  U d is relatively low, one is likely to be 
willing to bear a greater mortality risk to achieve a cure. This kind of reasoning 
may well seem morbid at first glance, but in effect, this is the kind of trade-off that 
a person with a disability or other serious health condition may face. The physician

may explain the risk of surgery to the patient or a member of the patient ’ s family, 
and it is eventually up to the patient or family to determine whether or not the 
operative risk is worth it. 
 Values of  Θ are not generally obtained from patients making actual decisions 
but rather are obtained from surveys in which hypothetical disease states and 
associated adverse effects of the disease are described and the respondent is asked 
for the  Θ value that would make him or her indifferent between undergoing the 
procedure or not. A  Θ * value yielding indifference is obtaining by varying  Θ and 
eliciting which choice the person makes. 
 For example, to elicit  Θ *, an interviewer might randomly start a series of 
questions with an assumed probability of 0.10. If the respondent selects the opera-
tion at  Θ = 0.10, the probability is increased to, for example, 0.20. If the respondent 
still accepts the operation, the probability is raised still higher. The probability is 
raised until the respondent refuses the operation. Then  Θ * is located between the 
final question ’ s  Θ and the  Θ in the immediately previous question. 
 However, if the operation is refused on the first question, the next question 
might be whether or not the person would undergo the operation if the probability 
of death were 0.15. If the operation is still refused, the person is asked about his 
or her response if the probability were 0.125. If the answer is that the person would 
refuse the operation at  Θ = 0.125, the person is asked about his or her choice if the 
probability were 0.1125. If the answer is affirmative, the probability is increased 
to the midpoint of 0.1125 and 0.125. The process continues until a  Θ  value is found 
within this small interval at which the person states that he or she would refuse 
the operation. 
 This survey approach works well if the disease in question is sufficiently well 
characterized and the respondent is able to assess the trade-off as if it were real. 
This technique has the advantage of eliciting utilities from an explicit trade-off, 
but, as with the psychological measures, there is a question of whether or not 
persons who have not experienced the illness can know what their utility in the 
sick state would be if they actually had the illness described in the scenario. 
 While the standard gamble is based on  von Neumann and Morgenstern ’ s 
(1944 ) framework for decision making under uncertainty (discussed in chapter 2), 
and in this sense has a sound theoretical basis, there is a question of whether or 
not people who have not personally experienced the hypothetical situation can 
truly grasp the nuances and provide sufficiently accurate estimates of  Θ . Also, some 
people may have difficulty working with the concept of a probability. Rating scales 
and magnitude estimation do not require survey respondents to think about 
probabilities. 
 Another, somewhat simpler trade-off approach uses a trade-off in terms of 
time. The  time trade-off approach has the advantage of being clearer to respondents 
who do not understand the concept of probability. In a time trade-off, a person is 
offered a choice of living for a certain amount of time in perfect health, such as  X 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 631
in   figure 14.2 , or a variable amount of time in a health state that is less than perfect 
health (corresponding to an illness or disability), such as  t in   figure 14.2 . 
Any respondent would prefer being in perfect health (option 2) to the alternative 
(option 1). However, keeping time ( t ) with the illness constant, the interviewer 
reduces time in perfect health ( X ) until the respondent is indifferent between being 
in perfect health and the alternative, or  U d t =  U h X . This approach, like the standard 
gamble, can be used to derive QALY weights. In this case,  U d is given by  X / t when 
 U h = 1.  
 Another outcome measure is the disability-adjusted life year. DALYs are used 
to calculate the global burden of disease.. One DALY can be interpreted as one year 
of  “ healthy ”  life lost. Summing DALYs for a given population yields an estimate 
of the difference between current health status and an ideal health situation in 
which the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability. 
DALYs for a disease or health condition are calculated as the sum of the years of 
life lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and the years lost due 
to disability (YLD) for incident cases of the health condition: DALY = YLL + YLD, 
where YLL equals the number of deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy 
at the age at which death occurs and YLD equals the product of (1) the number of 
incident cases, (2) a disability weight for each disease, and (3) the mean duration 
of the case until remission or death in years, whichever occurs first. 
 Because YLL measures the incident stream of lost years of life due to deaths, 
an incidence perspective is also taken for the calculation of YLD. To estimate YLD 
for a particular cause in a particular time period, the number of incident cases in

that period is multiplied by the average duration of the disease and a weight factor 
that reflects the severity of the disease on a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (dead). 
 Some outcome measures used in CEA calculations, such as lives saved, life 
years saved, and DALYs, abandon the concept of utility entirely. Other such mea-
sures quantify changes in the incidence of specific illnesses or days lost due to 
illness or disability or days lost from work. 
 Still other measures focus on physical functioning, especially the functioning 
of elderly persons. Important among these are limitations of activities of daily living 
(ADL), limitations in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and Nagi dis-
ability measures (see, e.g.,  George, Ruiz, and Sloan 2008 ). ADL limitations refer to 
whether or not the person needs or receives assistance with basic routine activities 
such as bathing, toileting, getting out of bed, eating, dressing, and crossing a room. 
IADL limitations refer to limitations with other activities that, although important, 
are not performed by everyone who is not impaired in physical functioning: shop-
ping, cooking, doing the laundry, doing personal finances, and using the telephone. 
Nagi disability measures gauge the person ’ s ability to perform four basic lower- and 
upper-body functions: pushing large objects, kneeling, stooping, reaching above 
one ’ s shoulders, and writing or handling small objects. This group of measures is 
useful in evaluating therapies for such potentially debilitating conditions as arthri-
tis and stroke. These outcome measures are applicable to CEA calculations of total 
hip or total knee replacement surgery, and the cost-effectiveness ratios are estimates 
of cost per procedure per reduction in ADL or IADL limitations. 
 Another dimension of disability is cognitive impairment. Various instruments 
for evaluating cognitive status are available. One, the Short Portable Mental Status 
Questionnaire, asks such questions as  “ What is the date today? ”  “ What day of the 
week is it? ”  “ What is your telephone number? ”  “ What is your age? ” and asks the 
patient to perform cognitive tasks such as  “ Subtract 3 from 20 and keep subtracting 
3 from each new number, all the way down ” ( Pfeiffer 1975 ). Measures of change 
in cognitive function would be appropriate for use in a cost-effectiveness analysis 
of a new drug for treating Alzheimer ’ s disease. 
 The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale CES-D asks a series 
of questions about mood in the recent past ( Andresen, Malmgren, Carter, et al. 
1994 ). Such a scale might be used for a CEA of a new drug for treating depression. 
For a CEA of a new drug designed to regulate blood pressure, blood pressure read-
ings may be the outcome measure of choice. 
 Evaluating the Marginal Effect of Specific Technologies 
 Goal of Evaluation 
 A basic component of any cost-effectiveness (or cost-benefit) analysis is translating 
input use into outputs. In economics, this is the role of the production function. 
In health care, the production function is often expressed as a conditional 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 633
probability of observing particular outcomes — conditional on a given level of input 
use. Inputs may be nurse staffing per patient in the hospital, a drug, a diagnostic 
test that leads to a more timely therapeutic intervention, or a medical device, such 
as knee or hip prosthesis or a lens implanted in the eye of a patient with 
cataracts. 
 Transition Probabilities 
 In the simplest form, the relationship between inputs and outputs can be expressed 
as a transition probability, or the probability that in a given time period, the person 
remains in the same health state as at the beginning of the period, or alternatively 
transitions to another state. Suppose, for example, that there are three health states: 
good health (G), poor health (P), and dead (D). 
 Table 14.1  is a two-by-three matrix displaying transition probabilities from 
year  t to year  t + 1. The matrix is two by three because death is an  “ absorbing state ” 
(there are no transitions in a nonbiblical context from death back to life). By 
contrast, a person ’ s health can improve or deteriorate. The bottom row gives the 
probabilities that a person is in good or poor health in year  t ; the rightmost 
column gives the probabilities that the person is in good or poor health or dead in 
year  t + 1.  
 Suppose that a new drug has been shown in an RCT to be effective in treating 
people with a specific health condition who are initially in poor health. Let  Θ PG  
be the probability that a person initially in poor health is in good health in the 
next period. Thus, if the drug is effective,  Θ PG  is expected to rise for drug users 
relative to  Θ PG  for nonusers of the drug. Further,  Θ PG  +  Θ PP  +  Θ PD  = 1. Thus, the sum 
of  Θ PP  and  Θ PD  falls by the same amount that  Θ PG  rises. 
 Markov Chains 
 Data on long-term outcomes from the use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures 
are rarely available. Waiting for data on long-term outcomes before approving a 
procedure for use would substantially and often unacceptably delay the introduc-
tion of new procedures. Thus, long-term outcomes are inferred from repeated

application of transition probabilities of the type shown in   table 14.1 . In its sim-
plest form, the transition probabilities are constant among periods. Such probabili-
ties can be used to form a Markov chain (see, e.g.,  Keeler 1995 , 195 – 201). The 
transition probabilities are constant in the sense that a transition probability 
between two adjacent periods  t and  t + 1 depends only on state the individual is 
in  t , not only states prior to  t . For example, all persons in the good (G) health state 
in a year are assumed to be the same, regardless of their health histories before the 
year. Using this assumption, one can project health states far into the future. 
Persons who die (D) in a year are dropped from the sample from this point forward. 
 For example, suppose that 1,000 individuals are in the poor (P) health state 
in  t and  Θ PG  is 0.45,  Θ PP  is 0.40, and  Θ PD  is 0.15, the probability of being in poor 
health in period 1 and dead in period 2, without the drug. With the drug, the prob-
abilities are 0.65, 0.30, and 0.05, respectively. Then one can compute the number 
of persons in the each health state over a number of years if the drug is not taken 
or is taken on a continuous basis. Populations in each health state change in each 
period, as does the number of persons involved in health state transitions. We leave 
it for an exercise for students to compute populations in good and poor health after 
several years, given that people take or do not take the drug.  2 
 Obtaining Transition Probabilities from Observational Data 
 In the above example, the transition probabilities with and without the drug are 
known. The transition probabilities would ideally be determined from an RCT. But 
while trials have the advantage of dealing with the endogeneity problem discussed 
earlier in chapter 3 and immediately below, they measure effects when procedures 
are applied under medical protocols, which reflect ideal conditions, not necessarily 
how they are applied in the world of actual medical practice. Further, for some 
procedures, RCTs are not ethical. For example, surgical procedures are not subject 
to regulatory review prior to their introduction. It is likely to be unethical to with-
hold a specific therapy already being used by some physicians with reports of 
success specifically for purposes of research. Thus, researchers often rely on obser-
vational data.  3 
 An example of the production function approach using observational data is 
an evaluation of the impact of intensive treatment on the mortality rates of elderly 
persons following admission to the hospital for heart attacks ( McClellan, McNeil, 
and Newhouse 1994 ). The treatment of heart attacks can be solely medical, which 
involves monitoring the patient in the hospital and use of medications. More 
intensive treatment involves coronary artery bypass surgery or a procedure called 
angioplasty, in which a catheter with a balloon is inserted into the patient ’ s coro-
nary arteries to remove the obstruction that caused the heart attack and to widen 
the blood vessels to allow blood to flow more freely. The main outcome measure 
in the above-mentioned study was the probability that an elderly person survived 
four years following a heart attack.

(1995)  for useful 
applications of Markov 
processes.

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 635
 The authors did not have data from an RCT. Rather, they had administrative 
data — claims data and demographic data from the US Medicare program on persons 
who were hospitalized with a heart attack. With observational data, there is the 
possibility that patients with a disease that is more severe in ways not documented 
in the data could have influenced the choice of intensive or nonintensive care fol-
lowing the heart attack. 
 A production function measures the effect of inputs on outputs — not the 
effect of outputs — in this case, the effect of outcomes on input use. Outcomes may 
be highly correlated with the patient ’ s severity of illness and other clinical factors, 
which often are not well measured in administrative data, such as claims submitted 
to an insurer such as Medicare. Since severity of illness (observable to the patient ’ s 
physician but not to researchers using the administrative data) and other clinical 
factors affect the choice of inputs, input choice is endogenous, and the parameter 
estimates relating inputs to outcomes are biased. For example, if otherwise healthy 
heart attack victims are more likely to undergo open heart surgery, it may appear 
that survival is better among heart attack victims who receive surgery than those 
who do not. But the better outcomes would actually be due to unmeasured severity 
of illness and not at all reflect the effectiveness of such surgery. In an RCT, patients 
are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. So the choice of inputs is 
not related to unmeasured factors. Because of randomization, unmeasured factors 
in treatment and control groups should be the same. 
 The authors ’ solution for avoiding biased parameter estimates with the use 
of observational data was to find a variable that is uncorrelated with patient sever-
ity of illness or other clinical factors not explicitly included in their analysis but 
was highly correlated with the use or non-use of intensive treatment for a patient ’ s 
heart attack, cardiac catherization and open heart surgery. In technical terms, such 
a variable is called an instrumental variable. The authors determined the distance 
from the patient ’ s residence to each hospital in the area in which the patient lived. 
If, for example, there were three hospitals in the patient ’ s area, the authors com-
puted the distance to each of the facilities. Only some of the hospitals offered 
intensive therapies to patients with heart attacks. The others just offered less inten-
sive, medical therapies. If the patient lived relatively near a hospital with intensive 
and medical therapies, the hypothesis was that the probability of being admitted 
to a hospital with intensive therapy would be higher. 
 In fact, relative distance from the alternative hospitals was an important 
determinant of hospital choice. Relative distance was a good instrumental variable 
since it seems unlikely that people chose where they live based on the type of 
heart attack care hospitals in the area offered. Rather, location of residence may 
reflect location of job or relatives. In this way, differential distances approximately 
randomized patients to different probabilities of receiving intensive treatments. 
Comparisons of patient groups that differed only in differential distances showed 
that intensive treatment increased the survival probability of Medicare patients 
admitted to hospitals with a diagnosis of heart attack by up to five percentage

points. Given their analytic approach, the authors could argue that this was a true 
measure of treatment effectiveness, not just a reflection of some unmeasured factor 
associated with poor health outcomes. 
 Discounting 
 Rationale for Discounting 
 Many decisions involve costs or benefits accruing over several years. The principle 
of discounting is that costs and benefits accruing later should receive less weight 
than those occurring earlier. The process of discounting applies to all economic 
decisions — decisions involving the allocation of scarce resources — of which 
medical decisions are a subset. Pharmaceutical products for treating various dis-
eases such as high blood pressure and cancer, diet therapies, and smoking cession 
and exercise regimens, and as we have just seen, treatments for heart attacks can 
have long-run effects on health spanning several years and, in some cases, decades. 
Likewise, incurring costs later is preferable to incurring costs earlier. The issue is 
not whether or not to discount but which discount rate to use. 
 In an idealized risk-free, tax-free, competitive world in which outputs could 
be perfectly traded among time periods, there would be only one interest rate. That 
rate would reflect (1) the marginal rate of time preference — the rate that equalizes 
a given amount of consumption in two adjacent periods (the same amount of con-
sumption is worth less to consumers if consumed later than earlier), and (2) the 
marginal rate of return on investment — the time trade-off in production. The inter-
est rate is that rate that equates the time trade-off in consumption with the time 
trade-off in production. 
 If there were absolutely no risk, the real rate of interest (the rate that takes 
inflation into account) might be about 1 percent ( Lind 1982 ) rather than one to 
three times larger. Market risk occurs because the value of an interest- bearing 
security varies inversely to the rate of interest paid on that security. Thus, if there 
is market risk, the holder of the security bears a risk that interest rates will increase 
and the market value of the security will fall. Credit risk refers to the probability 
that the issuer of the security will default on its payments to the holder of the 
security. Suppliers of capital face risk and therefore demand an additional return 
for risk bearing. 
 Economists distinguish between social and private discount rates. In the case 
of private decision makers, the appropriate rate of discount reflects the individual ’ s 
own willingness to trade present for future consumption or, in the case of a firm ’ s 
decision to borrow or invest, its marginal cost of funds. Because the government 
as the agent for society faces fewer intertemporal borrowing constraints, the social 
discount rate may be less than its private counterpart. Further, national govern-
ments ’ debt obligations are not subject to credit risk.  4 
 On the other hand, it is possible to underestimate the social discount rate for 
purposes of project evaluation. For example, in the former Soviet Union, where

the government is 
affil iated with a central 
bank, which controls 
the money supply. Other 
governments may 
be come bankrupt, and 
hence the securities 
they issue are subject to 
credit as well as market 
risk.

interest was seen as a capitalist concept, capital projects with very low rates of 
return were undertaken on the presumption that the social discount rate in a social-
ist society was zero or nearly so. Using such extremely low discount rates can result 
in too few resources being devoted to projects with not-too-distant investment 
returns. 
 The social discount rate is the relevant one for public decisions, including 
decisions about investments in health care infrastructure, biomedical research, and 
even social insurance programs with a deferred benefit. In practice, the social rate 
may not be that much lower than its public counterpart. Too much of a discrepancy 
if applied to evaluations of net benefits of public investments could divert too many 
resources from the private sector to the public sector. 
 Determining the Appropriate Discount Rate: Financial versus 
Health Discount Rates 
 There are many market rates of interest in financial markets. These are private rates 
reflecting the demand and supply of capital funds, the former reflecting rates of 
return on investment projects and the latter reflecting a combination of rates of 
time preference of suppliers of capital and their own investment opportunities. At 
a point in time, interest rates reflect monetary policy, expectations about future 
prices, and other factors. 
 Among health care experts who think about discounting, there has been some 
discussion about whether or not financial rates should be used in decisions about 
health. The alternative is to use health discount rates, which involve trade-offs in 
time in health rather than in money terms (see, e.g.,  Viscusi 1996 ). Health and 
financial discount rates would differ if people have different time trade-offs when 
making intertemporal health decisions as opposed to financial decisions. 
 There are several arguments for using financial discount rates. First, in 
CBA, all costs and benefits are expressed in monetary terms. Second, as seen in 
chapter 2, health flows (e.g., healthy days) can enter as an argument in the indi-
vidual ’ s utility function in the same way that the consumption of other goods and 
services can enter. It makes sense to discount consumption from the person ’ s health 
stock and consumption of other goods and services in the same way. Third, not 
discounting at the same rate could introduce biases in resource allocation, for 
example, if the health rate were set lower than for other goods and services or 
conversely. 
 The main argument against using a financial discount rate to compute the 
present value of health benefits is that unlike other commodities, health cannot 
always be traded across time. For example, one can undergo the agony (for some 
persons) of long-distance running now, a health investment, for the benefit of 
improved cardiovascular fitness later. Or one can disinvest now, by enjoying a 
smoke, with the consequence of a higher probably of getting a smoking-related 
disease a decade or several decades later. But some adverse health conditions, such 

638 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
as stage IV cancer and congestive heart failure, both of which often lead to death, 
are irreversible. 
 In the end, the argument favors those who would use financial rates. Empiri-
cal studies tend to find no systematic difference in financial and health discount 
rates (see, e.g.,  Chapman, Freiberg, Quiggin, et al. 2003 ). 
 There are several sources of information on discount rates. Surveys have been 
employed to elicit rates of time preference (see, e.g.,  Harrison, Lau, and Williams 
2002 ;  Khwaja, Silverman, and Sloan 2007 ). These studies show considerable indi-
vidual variation in discount rates and often implausibly high rates, especially for 
decisions with a short time span. Harrison and co-authors reported that persons 
with more education, those with higher skills, and homeowners in their survey 
had lower discount rates, while retired persons had higher rates. These differences 
in discount rates suggest that the poor, less educated, unskilled, and retired persons 
are relatively worse off when policy makers select projects with more delayed 
returns. 
 A second approach infers discount rates from decisions people make about 
labor market choices or product choices ( Moore and Viscusi 1990a, 1990b ). For 
example, suppose that an energy-saving refrigerator saves $100 a year in energy 
bills and is usable for 20 years, but the refrigerator costs $400 more than otherwise 
identical refrigerators. Then it is possible to solve for the discount rate that makes 
buyers indifferent between the two types of refrigerators. This type of calculation 
has yielded implicit discount rates of well over 20 percent ( Viscusi 1996 ). This 
high rate reflects data indicating that people are not willing to pay a much higher 
price for a refrigerator now to save money on energy bills later. 
 There are many reasons why purchasers may be willing to pay so little extra 
for an energy-saving refrigerator. One reason may be that the person does not have 
a time horizon of 20 years but a much shorter time horizon. For example, perhaps 
the person expects to move in a few years. Or the purchaser may expect energy 
prices to fall, and for this reason, the annual savings in energy bills may be less 
than $100. Readers may be able to think of other reasons for why some people may 
not be willing to pay much more for an energy-saving refrigerator. 
 A third approach is simply to use a real interest rate, such as 3 percent, as 
the real social rate of discount. Between 1965 and 2005, real interest rates on US 
three-month Treasury bills have varied from about minus 3 percent to slightly over 
5 percent, with 2 to 3 percent being a common value (see, e.g.,  Mankiw 2007 , 
541 – 542), and as already noted, real interest rates have been around 3 percent on 
long-term US government bonds. The US Panel on Cost Effectiveness suggested 
using a 3 percent discount rate in cost-effectiveness calculations, but it noted that 
many studies have used a 5 percent rate ( Gold, Siegel, Russell, et al. 1996 ). The 
panel suggested that 0 to 7 percent rates be used in sensitivity analysis to gauge 
the sensitivity of the recommendations obtained from the CEA to changes in the 
assumed discount rate. 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 639
 Computing a Cost-Effectiveness Ratio 
 The results of CEA are typically presented as a ratio (CER) of the net costs to the 
net health outcomes of alternative intervention strategies (or health programs or 
products): 
 CER = ( C 1  –  C 2 )/( O 1  –  O 2 ), 
(14.1) 
 where  C represents costs,  O represents the outcomes of an intervention, and the 
subscripts 1 and 2 refer to alternative interventions 1 and 2. One of the  “ interven-
tions ” can be doing nothing other than continue current practice. Costs include (1) 
those directly (e.g., additional physician visits for monitoring for complications 
following the intervention) associated with the intervention and (2) cost increases 
attributable to the intervention (e.g., work losses during the recovery period), minus 
(3) the costs saved by the intervention (e.g., reductions in work losses and in 
medical expenditures after the recovery period has been completed). 
 For example, suppose patients are being treated with a generic drug to lower 
blood pressure, product 2. A new branded drug, product 1, is being evaluated with 
CEA. The new drug is more expensive than the old drug, and the new drug requires 
an additional physician visit for monitoring potential adverse side effects. But on 
average, the new drug, product 1, reduces hospitalizations for stroke. All additional 
cost net of cost offsets should be included in the numerator of equation 14.1. Since 
the reduced hospitalizations may occur years after the new drug is initially taken, 
the cost offsets (savings) should be discounted. 
 The outcomes, represented by the  O ’ s in the denominator of equation 14.1, 
can be any of the output measures discussed above (or others). 
 Health policy makers and private insurers are confronted with many new 
technologies that are proposed to be covered by insurance during a year. Suppose 
one CER measures a cost of $ x per reduced hospitalization for stroke. A problem 
with CEA is that another technology under consideration might reduce children ’ s 
days lost from school. Although the numerators are in monetary terms, the denomi-
nators are not in the same units. 
 Comparing apples to oranges is difficult. Many CEAs use life years or QALYs 
gained for the  O ’ s. Then multiple projects can be compared in the same units. 
 Even if the numerators and the denominators of the technologies being com-
pared are in the same units, the question remains as to where the line is between 
those technologies to adopt and those to reject. There is no natural cut point. 
 Arbitrary cutoffs are CERs, such as cost per life year saved, where the value 
of a year life saved equals the country ’ s GDP per capita population or some multiple 
of the country ’ s per capita GDP, such as three times per capita GDP. If analysts 
assume that the value of life saved equals the value of a life year saved, a cutoff 
could be figured this way: the mean per capita GDP from 163 countries in 2005 
was US$10,200, with a range of over US$66,000 for Luxembourg to US$556 for 

640 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
Malawi. The US per capita GDP was slightly over US$39,000. Using the all-country 
average as the value of a life year, and assuming the technology saves half a life 
year per unit, the technology would be considered  “ cost-effective ”  if the cost were 
US$5,100 or less. Using a criterion of three times per capita GDP, the procedure 
would be cost-effective if it cost US$15,300 or less. Using per capita GDP as the 
value of a life year amounts to assigning a value of life year well over 100 times 
higher in Luxembourg than in Malawi. 
 Many health experts are reluctant to place a monetary value on life for ethical 
reasons. Indeed, valuing a life year in Luxembourg at over 100 or even 300 times 
more valuable than in Malawi is troublesome and seems arbitrary. However, since 
public budgets are not limited to health, it is also necessary for policy makers to 
be able to compare health with non-health investments. Private insurers must also 
make choices about what to cover. Comparing life years/QALYs gained with a mile 
of highway paved is a difficult task unless benefits can be characterized in units 
common to all projects. The common denominator is likely to be money ( Pauly 
1996 ). 
 14.4 
 Applications of Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 Disease Prevention 
 CEA has been used to assess the costs and health benefits of screening strategies 
for colorectal cancer, including fecal occult blood testing, or FOBT (testing for 
blood in the stool), sigmoidoscopy (examination of the lower third of the intestine 
with a scope), barium enema studies, and colonoscopy (examination of the entire 
intestine with a scope). CEA can also be used to determine the optimal age at which 
screening should be done, and how often it should be done. 
 The Experience of a US State, Oregon 
 In the above applications, CEA is applied to individual technologies to determine 
if and under which circumstances a particular diagnostic or therapeutic procedure 
should be implemented. At the other end of the spectrum are decisions about the 
overall allocation of health care resources. CEA has been applied to overall resource 
allocation, with mixed success. 
 A well-publicized lack of success occurred in the US state of Oregon ( Kaplan 
1995 ;  Saha, Hoerger, Pignone, et al. 2001 ). The broad objective was to improve the 
allocation of health care resources in the state, especially those resources used by 
low-income persons — in other words, to  “ get more bang for the health care buck. ” 
 In pursuit of this objective, the Oregon Health Services Commission ranked 
health care services according to their CERs in order to expand health services to 
the poor in that state. While there was an expansion in some services, coverage of 
services with high CERs (unfavorable) was reduced or eliminated. This reallocation 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 641
process was highly criticized as tantamount to unethical  “ rationing. ”  Patients and 
health professionals objected to withholding services with high CERs to save 
money to reallocate public budgets to services with lower CERs. In the end, the 
US federal government ended this interesting state experiment. 
 Oregon tried to use CEA to allocate health services across the board to a 
segment of its population. In practice, CEA seems to be less objectionable if used 
to decide the net benefit of a particular program rather than to determine overall 
health resource allocation. The latter is a far more complex undertaking that, in 
the end, requires many assumptions to complete the comparisons. To illustrate the 
use of CEA, we describe three successful applications in some depth. 
 Cost-Effectiveness of Thrombolytic Therapy for Acute 
Myocardial Infarction 
 Hospital pharmacy budgets are rising all over the world because many of the drugs 
introduced in recent years have been much more expensive than the older ones. 
Thus, in the interest of optimal resource allocation at the hospital level, it is impor-
tant to compare the cost-effectiveness of new versus older drugs, which are designed 
to treat a given patient type. 
 A relatively new idea is to treat patients with a heart attack, in technical 
jargon known as acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, with a blood thinner to break 
up clots that block the coronary arteries. If done in a timely manner, within a 
certain time period after the onset of symptoms (within 1.5 – 3 hours), clearing the 
arteries in this way can reduce the damage to the heart muscle that otherwise is 
likely to result from an AMI.  Mark, Hlatky, Califf, et al. (1995)  undertook a com-
parative study of streptokinase and a newer drug called tissue plasminogen activa-
tor, or t-PA. Both are clot-busting drugs for use in the early phase of an AMI, but 
t-PA is a more expensive than streptokinaise. 
 Mark and co-authors evaluated four treatment regimens: (1) t-PA, (2) strepto-
kinase with intravenous heparin, (3) streptokinase with subcutaneous heparin, and 
(4) a combination of t-PA and streptokinase. Heparin is a blood thinner, an older 
drug.  Intravenous means that the drug is injected directly into a vein.  Subcutane-
ous means that the drug is injected under the skin. The authors were able to use 
empirical evidence on the comparative effectiveness of t-PA and streptokinase from 
a randomized clinical trial, GUSTO. From GUSTO, it is known that t-PA improves 
the probability of surviving after an AMI more than streptokinase does, yet t-PA is 
more expensive, and the question for Mark and colleagues was whether or not 
t-PA ’ s extra cost is worth it. 
 Data from the GUSTO trial provided information on the one-year survival 
probabilities following AMI. The authors had information from medical records 
regarding the services provided to over 23,000 patients hospitalized for AMI. In 
addition, 2,600 of these patients were surveyed at 30 days, six months, and one 
year following the AMI on their use of services since hospital discharge and their 

642 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
quality of life. The authors used a social perceptive, although they did not include 
such costs as patient time lost from work and nonmedical costs, such as paid help 
in the home following hospital discharge and the cost of travel to physicians. 
The primary outcome measure was survival. Quality-of-life information obtained 
from the patient surveys was used in sensitivity analysis — analysis that seeks 
to determine whether varying the parameters, outcome measures, and so forth 
alters a study ’ s conclusions. Cost-effectiveness was measured as the additional 
lifetime cost required to add a year of life using t-PA compared with streptokinase 
therapy. 
 To determine therapy cost, the authors gathered data from the hospital 
accounting system at Duke University Hospital in the US state of North Carolina 
on costs per unit of service (e.g., a hospital day), including the cost of drug admin-
istration. Only costs for the year following the AMI were included in the analysis. 
Thus, the authors assumed that there was no cost difference between t-PA and 
streptokinase after the first year following the AMI. 
 Survival probabilities were computed for 15 years following the AMI, but the 
authors assumed no difference between t-PA and streptokinase after the first year 
following the AMI. GUSTO provided survival data only up to a year. It seems 
plausible that the effects of the two drugs would not extend more than the 
first year. 
 To measure quality of life at the survey dates, the authors asked patients time 
trade-off questions. Patients were asked a series of questions, including how much 
of their current life expectancy (which the interviews postulated was 10 years from 
the interview date) the patients would be willing to give up to be in excellent health 
for the rest of their lives. 
 The results from the study were enlightening. First, other than for the added 
cost of t-PA, resource consumption within the first year following the AMI was 
similar for the t-PA- and streptokinase-treated patients. With drug costs included, 
the  added  cost of t-PA during year 1 was $2,845 (1993 US$). On average, patients 
who received t-PA lived an extra 0.14 years. The cost per extra life year saved was 
$32,678, with a 95 percent confidence interval of $18,781 – $71,039; the $32,678 
estimate is less than the $50,000 threshold that is sometimes used in the United 
States to separate cost-effective from non-cost-effective technologies. Hence, while 
t-PA cost more, it was worth it in terms of life extension. Using an alternative 
estimate of the price of t-PA, the relative cost was $27,115 per life year saved. 
 In an alternative calculation, the authors adjusted for the quality of life of 
both groups. The mean utility weight or QALY one year post AMI for both groups 
was 0.9 (implying that quality of life was the same). Dividing the $32,678 estimate 
by 0.9 yields a CER of $36,402 per life year saved. But in addition, GUSTO revealed 
that in the first 30 days post AMI, t-PA produced one extra stroke per 1,000 patients 
relative to streptokinase. The higher stroke rate would be expected to decrease the 
survival differential for patients receiving t-PA from 0.14, which was actually 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 643
observed in GUSTO, to 0.13. Adjusting for the higher stroke probability and its 
possible impact on survival at one year increased the CER of using t-PA over strep-
tokinase by about $7,000. Still, relative to the $50,000 threshold, t-PA was seen to 
be cost-effective. 
 The authors concluded that providing t-PA to persons who experience heart 
attacks in the United States and are eligible for such therapy would add $500 
million to annual health spending in the United States, but providing t-PA would 
also result in 3.5 million additional life years. In a country as populous as the 
United States (over 300 million persons) and for a common condition, such as AMI, 
even small changes in survival probabilities yield substantial changes in life years 
saved. 
 Cost-Effectiveness of HIV Treatment in Low-Income Settings 
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(AIDS) are major sources of morbidity and mortality worldwide but particularly in 
low-income countries, such as those on the African continent. Effective antiretro-
viral therapies have been developed in recent years, but these therapies are costly. 
Different treatment strategies may be appropriate for low-resource countries than 
for more affluent countries where new technologies are typically developed. 
 Goldie, Yazdanpanah, Losina, et al. (2006)  used cost-effectiveness analysis to 
determine optimal treatment strategies for HIV/AIDS in a resource-poor country in 
Africa, the Ivory Coast. The study evaluated combinations of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) and a regimen called trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (TSP). 
Antiretovial drugs inhibit the spread of the HIV virus. TSP acts on the opportunistic 
infections that are caused by the virus (e.g., pneumonias). In other contexts, TSP 
is prescribed for urinary tract infections, frequently occurring bronchitis, and trav-
elers ’ diarrhea in adults and severe middle ear infections in children. 
 The authors used first-order Monte Carlo simulation to model disease pro-
gression of each individual patient from month to month. The key feature of this 
approach is that transitions from one health state to another are probabilistic. 
Transitions are only a function of the person ’ s health state in the previous month, 
not on the person ’ s entire health history. A key task for the research is to define 
the health states. In this study, health states were defined in terms of the person ’ s 
current (period  t ) and maximum HIV RNA levels, current and lowest ever CD4 
counts, and current and prior opportunistic diseases (e.g., pneumonia). RNA and 
CD4 counts measure the amount of the person ’ s infection with the HIV virus. The 
use of past maximum or minimum values of RNA and CD4 counts might seem to 
violate the first-order assumption, but in practice, the authors updated these 
maximum and minimum values each month. Thus, transitions to period  t + 1 were 
based entirely on information on the individual recorded at  t . 
 The authors had data on the probabilities of persons with HIV/AIDS in the 
various health states at baseline from an RCT conducted on persons with this 

644 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
disease in the Ivory Coast. This was fortunate, since the baseline probabilities are 
likely to differ among countries. They obtained data on the efficacy of TSP (prob-
abilities of reduction in specific types of infections, e.g., acute unexplained fever, 
severe bacterial infection), the efficacy of ART (percent HIV RNA suppression 
attributable to use of TSP at 52 weeks), and drug toxicity (adverse side effects due 
to TSP use) from other studies. They also obtained data on relevant costs, such the 
costs of TSP and ART and costs for treating drug toxicity, testing, treating oppor-
tunistic diseases, long-term care (stratified by CD4 count), and terminal care (care 
rendered after it is determined that death is imminent), as well as the direct costs 
of HIV-related care other than for TSP and ART (such as for a clinic visit, hospital 
day, and day care). 
 The information on efficacy of therapies came from countries other than the 
Ivory Coast. Thus, there was a question as to how well the model based on infor-
mation from other sources fitted the Ivory Coast. For this reason, a analytic first 
step was to determine how well predicted values from the model fitted actual 
changes over time from the trial conducted in Ivory Coast, a process that is called 
 “ model validation. ” Projected model outcomes were generally within 10 – 15 percent 
of reported trial results, which is a good result. Model parameters were based on 
averages, often drawn from data from other countries. Yet the predictions fit the 
Ivory Coast – specific data well. 
 The next step was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative treatment 
strategies.   Figure 14.3  shows main results of this analysis for specific treatment 
approaches between cost (horizontal axis) and life expectancy in months (vertical 
axis). The symbols in black represent strategies using both ART and TSP. The open 
symbols show the results with the use of ART only.  
 There are separate points for  “ no treatment ” and for the use of TSP alone, 
both of which ae associated with very low life expectancy. 
 A key element in a treatment strategy is the duration of treatment. Points in 
the figure are specific to the circumstances under which ART is initiated and 
stopped. For example,  “ Start ART: 2 ODs ” and  “ Stop ART: 1 OD ” mean that ART 
was initiated after the occurrence of a second opportunistic infection and stopped 
after the next opportunistic infection occurred. Thus, a strategy that initiates 
therapy at 1 OD and stops after 5 ODs following initiation of therapy involves a 
longer duration of ART than does a 2 OD – 1 OD strategy. Longer duration is associ-
ated with higher cost but longer life expectancy. If ART were ineffective, the cost 
would be higher but there would be little or no gain in life expectancy. CD4 cell 
counts represent additional or alternative clinical criteria for the initiation and 
cessation of therapy in some of the strategies depicted in the figure. 
 The solid line or  frontier  in   figure 14.3  identifies efficient treatment strategies. 
Points below the frontier represent inefficient treatment strategies in that a lower 
gain in life expectancy is achieved for a given cost. In this application, the strate-
gies employing ART alone are inefficient and some of those using both ART and 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 645
TSP are efficient. In general, the recommendation from this type of analysis is to 
employ strategies on the frontier. 
 The frontier depicts the total cost of achieving specific levels of life expec-
tancy. The frontier ’ s slope depicts the marginal cost of achieving a month ’ s increase 
in life expectancy. As the figure is drawn (with cost on the horizontal axis rather 
than on the vertical axis as cost curves are typically drawn), a higher slope repre-
sents a lower marginal cost. Thus, marginal cost increases as cost increases (although 
in stepwise fashion). Said another way, incremental cost effectiveness, the 
additional cost to obtain additional life years, rises with the amount of treatment 
given. The figure gives a menu of strategies that are socially optimal (those strate-
gies with points on the frontier), but which specific strategy should the policy 
maker select? 
 Figure 14.3 
 Cost-Effectiveness of Treatment Strategies
Strategies lying on the curve were more efficient than those lying to the right of the curve because they 
were more effective and either cost less or had a lower cost-effectiveness ratio, as compared with the next 
least expensive strategy. Strategies that relied on clinical criteria alone for starting and stopping antiretro-
viral therapy (ART), which are clustered in the lower left portion of the curve, were always less effective than 
strategies that included CD4 testing (clustered in the upper right portion of the curve). Strategies that 
involved ART alone (open symbols) were always more costly and less cost-effective than those that involved 
both ART and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (solid symbols). All costs are in 2002 US dollars.

 CEA offers no ideal answer to this question. The authors took a fairly common 
approach, which is to define the boundary between therapies that are cost-effective 
and those that are not cost-effective by the country ’ s per capita GDP, which 
was 708 US$. Using this criterion, one would increase program cost per life year 
saved up to the point that it equaled the country ’ s per capita GDP. Thus, wealthier 
countries would have higher thresholds for the dividing line between cost-effective 
and non-cost-effective technologies and hence would generally employ more 
costly treatment strategies than poorer ones. Another possible threshold for cost-
effectiveness is three times per capita GDP. If the latter threshold is utilized, more 
costly treatment strategies would be employed.  
 Box 14.1 
 A Procedure Yielding $1,374,246 per Life Year Saved 
 In a high-income country such as the United States, a cost per life year saved of 
$100,000 is often considered the maximum amount for which a technology is con-
sidered to be cost-effective. By contrast, in low- and middle-income countries, the 
threshold is considerably lower. From this perspective, how should we view a pro-
cedure that costs more than $1.3 million per life year saved? And why do people 
demand such technologies, even if they have to pay for the entire cost out of pocket? 
And should such technologies be made available to the public, and should some 
restrictions be imposed? Generally, economists promote choice and consumer 
sovereignty. 
 Kaimal, Smith, Laros, et al. (2009 ) used standard methods for evaluating the cost-
effectiveness of private umbilical cord blood banking versus no umbilical cord blood 
banking. Umbilical cord blood yields stem cells, which may be used as stem cell 
transplants by the child or a relative in the future. Alternatively, bone marrow trans-
plants from a matched but often unrelated donor may be performed. According to the 
authors, currently, bone marrow transplants and stem cell transplants are equally 
effective. 
 Cost-effectiveness reflects the cost of the technology, the probabilities of the tech-
nology being used, its effectiveness, and the probabilities and costs of treating adverse 
events from the use of the technology. Kaimal and colleagues assumed a cost of $3,620 
for umbilical cord blood banking and storage for 20 years, a 0.0004 probability of the 
child subsequently requiring an autologous stem cell transplant, a 0.0007 probability 
of a sibling requiring the same, and a 50 percent reduction in the probability of graft-
versus-host disease if a sibling used banked umbilical cord blood. The probability of 
the child acquiring such a disease from his or her own blood is 0. 
 Using these parameters, the cost of private umbilical cost blood banking per life 
year saved was estimated to be $1,374,246. The procedure becomes cost-effective at 
conventional levels only if the cost of such blood banking is less than $262 or the 
probability of a child needing a stem cell transplant is 0.0091, rather than the 0.0004 
estimate used in the baseline calculations. The $262 value assumes substantial 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

 The authors conducted various sensitivity analyses to gauge the robustness 
of their results to changes in assumptions about treatment efficacy and cost. This 
analysis showed that the results were quite sensitive to alternative assumptions 
about treatment cost. 
 Sensitivity analysis is very useful in policy analysis. The analyst should 
inform policy makers about the robustness of findings. Doing so avoids some 
unpleasant surprises later on. 
 What did CEA accomplish in this application? First, it identified a set of 
preferred strategies. Those that are dominant are clearly inferior to those on 
the frontier. Second, it ranked strategies in terms of their incremental cost-
effectiveness. Third, through the internal validation process, it helped ensure 
that the model parameters were sufficiently applicable to the country ’ s situation. 
Fourth, with the use of sensitivity analysis, the authors could learn which of their 
underlying assumptions had most effect on their results and hence on their recom-
mendations to policy makers. 
 In their conclusion, the authors emphasized that cost-effectiveness is only 
one consideration in the allocation of a country ’ s scarce resources. One can expect 
that there may be variation in the availability of strategies, such as the availability 
of particular drugs. Also, there are considerations of infrastructure, equity, non-
pecuniary factors, and interactions with other public programs. However, the 
technological change in the cost of the technology. Very few children would be esti-
mated to have a nearly 0.01 probability of receiving a stem cell transplant. 
 If the cost-effectiveness of umbilical cord banking is so poor, why is the technology 
demanded as much as it is? There are several possibilities. One is that many house-
holds value a life year at more than $1 million. This seems unlikely and runs counter 
to estimates published in the literature. Kaimal and colleagues mention two other 
possibilities. One is that people cannot accurately gauge the very low probabilities; 
cognitively, probabilities such as 0.0004 are too low for people to accurately compre-
hend them. If they plug in a higher probability in their mental calculations, even 
implicitly, demand for the technology will be higher than it otherwise would be. 
Advertising by private blood banking firms may have increased demand, possibly by 
making people think that the probability of such blood being needed in the future is 
higher than it is objectively. Another possibility, not mutually exclusive of the others, 
is that people believe there will be technological change in the future — in the technol-
ogy of storing blood, for example, which would reduce the future cost of blood 
banking, or in the uses for umbilical cord blood. Such beliefs should increase demand 
for the technology currently. Basing calculations of cost-effectiveness on assumptions 
that are appropriate currently is often a weakness of CEA.

presence of these other considerations should not be an acceptable pretext for not 
undertaking CEA or CBA. 
 Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Cervical Cancer in Low-
Income Settings 
 Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death among women in countries throughout 
the world. In low-income countries, up to 80 percent of women with cervical 
cancer first appear at a health care provider with an advanced stage of the disease. 
In high-income countries, routine screening of women for cervical cancer is 
common where the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is widely used to screen for 
cervical cancer. However, in low-income countries and in parts of middle-income 
countries in which low-income families predominate, screening for this cancer is 
much less common. Also, the facilities for interpreting Pap smears, such as labo-
ratories with properly trained cytotechnologists, are lacking. And given the dis-
tances from the testing site and the lack of availability of good transportation, 
asking women with positive screening results to return for treatment is often bur-
densome. For this reason, simple visual screening methods and approaches that 
allow for screening and treatment to be performed on the same visit have been 
proposed. 
 Our third application of CEA is also about optimal strategies in low-income 
settings where the resources for screening and other forms of care are very limited. 
In essence, this is the polar opposite case of the t-PA versus streptokinase example. 
Ratios of cost to life years saved in this application are far different than in the 
case of t-PA versus streptokinase, although the methods are similar. 
 Goldie, Kuhn, Denny, et al. (2001)  performed a CEA of alternative cervical 
cancer screening strategies in low-resource settings. The analysis focused on the 
screening of previously unscreened 30-year-old black South African women. 
Several strategies were considered, which differed in the number of clinic visits 
required, frequency of screening, and actions taken based on a positive test finding. 
The outcome measures were years of life saved, lifetime cost (in US dollars), and 
incremental CERs expressed in incremental cost per life year saved. 
 A diagram showing the transitions of cervical disease status, substantially 
simplified from Goldie and colleagues ’ article, is given in   figure 14.4 . In general, 
for our purposes, we do not need to know many of the technical medical details 
of the cervical cancer disease process. However, a few details are needed to inter-
pret the figure. 
 Cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HIV can add 
to the effect of HPV, increasing the rate of progression to cervical cancer. HIV infec-
tion can also progress on its own. Disease severity is measured by the CD4 cell 
count, with a low cell count worse than a high one (e.g.,  “ count 1 ” worse than 
 “ count 2 ” ). SIL stands for squamous intraepithelial lesions, which occur with cervi-
cal cancer. High values of SIL indicate worse health than low values. Once cancer 
has developed, it can spread to other parts of the body (metastasis 1 – 3). In contrast 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 649
to the previous examples, cervical disease status can both progress and regress. To 
keep the figure simple, only disease progression is shown in the chart.  
 Like the other studies, this application of CEA adopted a societal perspective, 
which means that all costs and benefits were counted, irrespective of to whom they 
accrued. However, unlike in the previous examples, the authors did account for 
the patient cost of travel time. They discounted costs/benefits (this is a CEA, not 
a CBA) at a 3 percent real rate. Transition probabilities came from the published 
literature. The authors accounted for heterogeneity in transition probabilities, 
which varied according to the woman ’ s DNA. The transition probabilities also dif-
fered by screening approach, which differed according to the number of clinical 
visits, the use of one or two screening tests, screening frequency, and the ages at 
which the women were screened. 
 The authors considered three-, two-, and one-visit strategies, the first of these 
being most common in high-income countries, with testing occurring on the first 
two visits (the second depending on the test result from the first visit) and treat-
ment occurring on the third visit. In the two-visit strategy, the diagnostic visits are 
compressed into one. In the one-visit strategy, diagnosis and treatment occur on a 
single visit. Given the distance that many women in low-income countries live

from diagnosis and treatment facilities and the lack of adequate modes of transpor-
tation, it is important to consider streamlined approaches that reduce the number 
of times the patient must visit the facility. 
 To estimate visit costs, the authors first identified the specific services associ-
ated with each screening strategy and then applied unit prices from a South African 
fee schedule to arrive at costs per visit. In addition, they conducted surveys of 
patients to estimate time spent traveling, waiting, and receiving health care and 
the cost of transportation to facilities. Time spent was multiplied by estimated 
hourly wage rates of low-income women. 
 The authors presented a graph similar to that in   figure 14.3  but with values from 
their analysis. As in the previous example, discounted lifetime total costs were on 
the horizontal axis and discounted life expectancy was on the vertical  y axis. 
 Relative to the other examples, judged in terms of cost-effectiveness, the 
strategies on the curve were great bargains. For example, HPV testing followed by 
treatment of screened positive women at a second visit cost $39 per life years saved, 
not tens of thousands of dollars as in the previous examples. Clearly, there is much 
to be done to improve the health of populations in low-resource settings, and cervi-
cal cancer screening is among the most promising strategies.

 Use of Economic Evaluation in Practice: 
Conclusions and Implications 
 The techniques described in this chapter and the next one are often called  eco-
nomic evaluation , a term in widespread use in the health field but one we are less 
than thrilled about since virtually all of the topics in health economics as well as 
in general economics could fall under this heading. In CBA, all costs and conse-
quences are valued in monetary terms. However, in health care, cost-effectiveness 
is much more commonly used, where the difference in cost between alternatives 
is compared with the difference in outcomes measured in units such as life years 
gained or QALYs gained. 
 The first country to formally adopt economic evaluation as a method for 
making health care reimbursement decisions was Australia in 1992. Since then, 
economic evaluation has been adopted as a method for making reimbursement 
decisions or the development of national guidance for health technologies in more 
than ten other countries, including eight EU countries — Belgium, Finland, Hungary, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, and the United Kingdom — plus Canada, 
New Zealand, and Norway ( Drummond 2007 ). 
 How economic evaluation is conducted varies among these countries. Gener-
ally, it has been confined to pharmaceuticals. The National Institute for Health and 
Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK assesses medical devices, medical procedures, 

Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
 651
and public health interventions in addition to pharmaceuticals. Even among coun-
tries that limit economic evaluation to pharmaceuticals, there are variations in 
policy, with some countries evaluating only new pharmaceutical products, while 
others limit evaluation to high-priced drugs, or those likely to have a large effect 
on the health care system in the country. The extent of regulatory control also 
varies. Some countries use the process of economic evaluation to make a formal 
decision to list or not list the drug for reimbursement on a national or a provincial 
formulary. Others use economic evaluation to issue evidence-based guidelines for 
appropriate use of the technologies. The same analytic techniques have been used 
by private medical organizations for guidelines, which are advisory but carry no 
enforcement teeth. 
 While CEA represents an advance over not doing CEA, it is not perfect by 
any means. For example,  Pauly (2007 ) is critical of how drug cost is typically 
measured in CEA. Given the markup over the marginal cost of a drug, the drug ’ s 
wholesale price tends to be far above marginal cost. From a social cost perspective, 
the resource use required to produce an extra unit of the product is relevant. The 
wholesale price includes the return to the manufacturer of its R & D cost, but the 
cost of R & D is a sunk cost once the drug has been developed. If CEA or CBA is 
used to decide whether to invest in R & D in developing a new drug, then the R & D 
cost is no longer sunk and should be included. 
 Although these techniques are not perfect, much of the opposition to formal 
evaluations of medical technologies probably reflects the business interests of 
enterprises that seek to avoid scrutiny, rather than an in-depth analysis of the 
methodological approaches that are being used. One legitimate concern is that the 
methods used in economic evaluation are not sufficiently transparent. In the appli-
cations we discussed and the articles we summarized, methods are described in 
capsule form, which is understandable, given tight journal space. Yet particularly 
since decisions based on economic evaluation can have important implications for 
a new product ’ s success, firms with a new product should be able to understand 
and critique the assessment methodologies that are used (see  Reinhardt 2007 ). 
 Governments in countries that have adopted economic evaluation techniques 
as a tool in the decision-making process do have a conflict of interest in that they 
are both payers and assessors, raising a suspicion that CEA or, much less com-
monly, CBA methods are skewed by the assessors to save public funds. There is 
indeed a potential conflict of interest. When new products are approved for 
payment, the immediate impact is on public budgets. The health gains, such as 
reductions in mortality from AMI, HIV/AIDS, and cervical cancer, are often realized 
later. Although using a social discount rate, these deferred benefits should be con-
sidered, the length of time that decision makers spend in their jobs is limited. Thus, 
being in a position of responsibility during a period of budget increases may be 
penalized, even if from a resource allocation standpoint the increased expenditures 
prove eventually to have been warranted. 

652 
 Part IV / Chapter 14
 Largely for this reason,  Reinhardt (2007)  suggests establishing nonprofit phar-
macoeconomic research institutes (PERIs), as opposed to government-run organiza-
tions, to produce systematic information on the relative cost-effectiveness of rival 
pharmaceutical products. PERIs presumably would not be subject to the same 
budgetary pressures as politicians are and therefore could assess particular tech-
nologies more objectively. 
 Finally, individual countries may benefit from information, whether or not 
they contribute to the information dissemination process. For this reason, the fea-
sibility of multicountry efforts is worth exploring.

 Exercises 
 14.1   Given the information listed in   table 14.1 , suppose that 1,000 individuals 
are in the poor health state in period  t and  Θ PG  is 0.45,  Θ PP  is 0.40, and  Θ PD  is 0.15 
without the drug. With the drug, the probabilities are 0.65, 0.30, and 0.05, respec-
tively. Compute the numbers of persons in the each health state over three years 
if people do not take drug. Similarly, compute the numbers of persons in the each 
health state over three years if people take drug. 
 14.2   Suppose the health department in a small country has been given a budget 
of $10 million to spend on new drugs. Its objective is to maximize health gains per 
dollar. The department ’ s analysts have developed a list of drugs that could be 
covered by the insurance program, together with estimates of their costs and ben-
efits (in QALYs gained):

 a.  Calculate the CER for each drug. 
 b.  List the drug that could be reimbursed by the insurance plan, and the threshold 
value of your reimbursement decision. 
 c.  If the budget of health department is cut and only $3 million can be allocated 
to spending for new drugs, which drugs will be included in the reimbursement

 14.3  Referring to chapter 2, suppose you were asked the following trade-off ques-
tion. Assume you had a particular disease (you need to pick a specific disease) and 
there was a surgical operation that would (1) either cure you of the disease com-
pletely, and you would be in perfect health,  or (2) possibly kill you during the 
operation, painlessly and quickly. Would you choose to have the operation if the 
chance of dying was 15 percent? 
 14.4  Suppose you were asked by a policy maker to measure cost for a new drug. 
Here is the information you receive about this drug (per daily dose): 
 Market price: US$25 
 Average wholesale price: US$18 
 Insurer acquisition price: US$15 
 Marginal cost: US$3 
 a.  What kind of measurement will you choose to measure the cost of new drug if 
you like to conduct CEA from a social perspective? Explain your answer. 
 b.  Will you change the measurement of cost if the policy maker asks you to conduct

 Measuring Benefits and Cost-
Benefit Analysis 
 Until now, we have discussed benefits in terms of units of health outcomes. Cost-
benefit analysis (CBA) measures benefits and costs in monetary terms, which 
allows benefits from health care programs to be compared not only with each other 
but also with those of programs in other areas. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is 
much more widely used in health policy applications. 
 CBA is more widely used in other areas, such as in appraising the value 
of environment programs, than it is in health. It is difficult to explain this 
difference. Environmental hazards cause damage to personal health and loss of 
longevity, too. 
 Proponents of CBA respond that in the final analysis, overall resource alloca-
tion requires the use of a common denominator such as money. Also, it is possible 
to adjust for the higher valuations of more affluent persons by weighing benefits 
accruing to less affluent individuals more highly (see, e.g.,  Pauly 1996 ). While we 
are persuaded by these arguments, we recognize that direct comparisons between 
projects across areas are not generally made; for example, a vaccine program is 
generally not directly compared with a highway construction program. Also, 
although it makes sense as a purely conceptual matter, reweighing benefits to adjust 
for the distributional effects of programs is hardly ever done in practice — at least 
as part of formal analysis. Decision makers may reject a project with benefits 
exceeding costs because of undesirable effects on one or more segments of the 
population. 
 The purpose of this chapter is to describe CBA and how it is implemented 
in particular. Since cost measurement has been discussed in the previous chapter, 
the emphasis here is on benefit measurement in theory and in application.

 Measuring Benefits in Cost-Benefit Analysis: 
A Review 
 Using a cost-benefit decision rule, the set of programs that is preferred is one that 
maximizes the excess of benefits over costs ( Mishan 1976 ). If the decision maker 
faces no budget constraint, all projects for which the benefit is greater than or equal 
to the cost should be undertaken. The difference between benefit and cost is then 
the relevant metric, not some other metric such as the ratio of benefit to cost. A 
ratio is a relevant measure comparison if the budget is fixed, lest the relatively 
small projects for which the difference between benefit and cost is necessarily rela-
tively small and hence not be selected, even though the return per dollar is higher 
for some relatively small projects. 
 When we use the metric that the benefit exceed or be equal to cost as the 
criterion for project adoption, it is not necessary that the benefit exceed the cost 
for each and every member of society. People differ in how much they benefit from 
a particular program. And for some persons, cost, for example, taxes paid for the 
project, is likely to exceed benefit even if in the aggregate, benefit exceeds cost. In 
principle, according to the Pareto criterion for a social optimum (see, e.g.,  Frank 
2006 , 591 – 594), when benefits exceed costs, it should be possible for winners from 
the project to compensate the losers. However, this is rarely done in practice. Pareto 
optimality, that is, a situation in which the winners could compensate the losers 
and still be better off than without the program, does not require that the losers 
actually be compensated. 
 Underlying the appropriate measure of benefit is the concept of individuals ’ 
maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for a given quantity of a good or service. Under 
ideal circumstances, maximum WTP is given by the demand curve for that good 
or service. For each quantity, there is a price that represents the person ’ s maximum 
willingness to pay for the last unit of quantity. Of course, if the person could get 
the good for a lower price, he or she would prefer this. The aggregate demand for 
that good or service is the sum of each market participant ’ s demand curve. In this 
sense, the aggregate demand curve for a private good, such as video games, repre-
sents the societal benefit of video games. 
 Several issues arise in benefit valuation of the types of goods and services 
considered in this book. The first concerns external benefits. When person A is 
vaccinated, person B potentially benefits. Further, there are financial externalities. 
Thus, if the good or service is covered by health insurance, the failure of person 
A to undergo screening potentially affects person B financially, in addition to 
affecting person A in terms of his or her health as well as financially. There are 
financial implications both in terms of person A ’ s and person B ’ s own spending on 
personal health care services and because each person is a taxpayer who will pay 

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis 
 659
higher taxes if the burden of disease is higher. External benefits are not reflected 
in market demand curves. 
 Second, not all health goods and services are marketable or marketed. Many 
public health programs fall into this category. For example, there is no market for 
a reduced probability of getting an infectious disease. In some cases, there is no 
existing prevention method, such as an effective vaccine to prevent the disease. 
Yet decision makers may want to know what the benefit of investing in research 
and development of the vaccine would be. Or a vaccine or drug for preventing or 
treating a certain disease may exist, but it is not available in the country in ques-
tion, and decision makers in the country may want to know if they should make 
the vaccine available to its citizens, which it might do if benefits exceed costs. 
When the market provides no metric, it is necessary to find another metric to 
measure benefit. 
 Third, for a private good such as a video game, there is little and probably 
no concern about distributional effects. If the rich buy more video games, perhaps 
because they consistently purchase the newest editions, this is fine with most 
people (with the notable exception of many children and video game – playing 
adults with low incomes). However, for personal health care services, the distribu-
tional effects of programs may be a matter of public, and hence public decision 
maker, concern. 
 CBA is mainly about public programs. A private decision maker, such as a 
for-profit firm, naturally views benefits in terms of revenue and costs in terms of 
the costs it incurs. With CBA, by contrast, the benefit should encompass various 
externalities as well as society ’ s distributional norms. 
 In a CBA, benefits are measured in essentially two ways. In one, the  revealed 
preference approach, benefits are based on the values implicit in choices people 
actually make. An example could be the additional wages people demand to work 
at jobs with greater personal health risks or the amount people pay for safety 
devices, such as in their automobiles or in their homes (e.g., radon detectors). 
 The other major method is based on surveys of individuals ’ willingness to 
pay for a good or service, the  stated preference  approach. These surveys most often 
use the method of  contingent valuation  to derive a valuation from choices 
made within a hypothetical context. A good or service is described, and the survey 
elicits the person ’ s maximum WTP for the good or service if it were provided. 
The good or service could be a personal health service, such as a screening test. 
Or it could be an environmental program or outcome, such as air of a certain quality 
or the provision of a park in the vicinity of the person being interviewed. The 
choices made by the respondents are used as measures of preference, and 
hence this methodology often is referred to as the stated preference approach. This 
is in contrast to the revealed preference approach, in which evaluation of the indi-
vidual ’ s maximum WTP is based on the observed actions within a market, for 

660 
 Part IV / Chapter 15
instance from purchases of radon detectors to reduce the personal risk of getting 
cancer. 
 Benefits can be viewed as negative costs. Thus, costs averted by programs can 
be considered beneficial. For example, if taking a particular drug can reduce hos-
pitalizations, such as aspirin to reduce subsequent heart attacks, the savings in 
expenditure on hospitalization is a potential benefit of adopting the drug. A poten-
tial benefit of smoking cessation program is the reduction in life years lost from 
continued smoking. 
 15.2 
 The Revealed Preference Approach 
 Objective 
 Most studies that use the revealed preference approach stipulate changes in longev-
ity as the outcome measure. The objective of the revealed preference approach is 
thus to derive the value of a statistical life (VSL) or a year of life. The most impor-
tant word in this expression is  statistical , which means that in this context, the 
value of a life is an abstraction, rather than the value of the life of a specific indi-
vidual. As newspaper reporters often remind us, the public tends not to be as 
interested in such abstract concepts as statistical lives; rather, the experiences of 
specific individuals are much more salient. Yet from the standpoint of public deci-
sion making, statistical lives are much more relevant. The use of VSL here is not 
in allocating resources to particular individuals. No one is suggesting that physi-
cians allocate their resources on the basis of the monetary and nonmonetary value 
of the lives of their patients, allowing those with a high value to live and terminat-
ing the lives of others. To do so would be highly illegal and inequitable, and most 
of us would judge such allocations immoral, apart from special cases such as pro-
viding high levels of medical care to very high-level executives and public 
officials. 
 Yet resource allocations are unavoidable at the policy level. Resources are 
scarce, and the traditional view held by many in the health care sector that all 
technologies that offer  some benefit should be adopted is also very wrong in our 
view and clearly unrealistic, especially in low-resource countries. The principle 
in some high-income countries that every type of care that yields positive benefits 
with regard to cost should be adopted inevitably leads to overspending on health 
care services. 
 The methods described below offer help to policy makers in making better 
public policy decisions. Many persons in and out of government are involved in 
performing the types of studies we describe. 
 Economists prefer to infer individuals ’ underlying preferences from their 
actual choices, not from what people say they would do in hypothetical situations. 
Economists place a great deal of confidence in information obtained from 

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis 
 661
individuals ’  actual choices, not their intended choices. The colloquial expression 
 “ put your money where your mouth is ” is the essence of the revealed preference 
approach. Literally, revealed preference means preferences as revealed by actual 
choices people make. 
 Given the value of a life year, the analyst can multiply this value by an esti-
mate of life years gained by a project, or, alternatively, quality of additional life 
years (QALYs) gained, which is a method for scaling life years to roughly account 
for the quality of life of the added years of life. The result is a benefit measure 
usable in CBA. 
 Underlying Assumptions 
 Several key assumptions underlie the revealed preference approach. First, people 
routinely make decisions that reflect the value they place on health and on mortal-
ity risks versus the value they place on other goods and services and on nonhealth 
outcomes. Such valuing is implicit in the act of operating a motor vehicle, smoking, 
or eating high-caloric food. Second, empirical evidence from choices that people 
make in the marketplace that involve trade-offs between risk and money reveal 
individuals ’  valuations or maximum WTP for an extra life year or QALY. Third, 
these values represent ex ante maximum WTP, not an ex post value. In other words, 
the values embedded in peoples ’ decisions reflect preferences before a decision is 
actually made. In revealed preference analysis, a decision is made before outcomes 
stemming from the decision are known.  “ Crying over spilled milk, ” or ex post 
regret, is understandable but has no role in this approach. 
 Evidence from Labor Markets 
 Most literature on the VSL calculated using the revealed preference approach 
comes from labor market studies. Associated with each job is a specific accident 
risk, including the risk of getting involved in a fatal accident. Conceptually, acci-
dent risk differentials among jobs are reflected in compensation differentials among 
jobs. 
 The firm ’ s demand for labor is a function of how much it must pay for a unit 
of labor.  1 Such compensation reflects wage payments, fringe benefits, training pro-
vided through employment (especially training that raises a worker ’ s productivity 
on several jobs), and investments the firm makes in providing a safer work environ-
ment for its employees. If, for example, workers are provided with helmets, this is 
as much a labor cost to the employer as are wage payments. Expenditures on fringe 
and other worker benefits and protections (e.g., helmets) appear as a cost on the 
firm ’ s income statement. Firms make investments in making the workplace safer 
for their employees. However, safer jobs tend to pay lower wages, which offsets 
the additional cost of investments in job safety, at least in part. 
 In this framework, workers are assumed to be expected utility maximizers 
(see chapter 4 for a discussion of expected utility). They maximize utility over wage 
1.  Our description here 
draws on  Viscusi and 
Aldy (2003 ).

662

and fringe benefit compensation  and  job-related risk. Since wages and fringe ben-
efits are a function of such risk, a worker need only pick a probability  Θ that maxi-
mizes his or her expected utility. If he or she selects a higher probability of 
experiencing an adverse outcome on the job, he or she receives a higher wage, all 
other factors held constant, and conversely if the worker picks a lower 
probability. 
 In   figure 15.1 , the relationship between wages (disregarding fringe benefits, 
the inclusion of which would yield no additional insights) and risk for the firm is 
shown as two offer curves (OC curves). Their slopes and positions reflect the tech-
nology of risk reduction as well as the price of such risk reduction technology. 
Think of the cost of making a coal mine safer. Such costs will depend on both the 
personnel employed in making the mine safer and the price of the technologies 
used, as well as on the marginal product of such technology measures in terms of 
the difference in the probability of an accident before and after implementation of 
the mine safety measures.  
 Since less investment in such technology is needed if there is to be higher 
job-related risk, the firm is able to offer higher wages when the work environment

is less safe. The relative expense of risk reduction technology is likely to differ 
among and even within industries, such as for different kinds of mines. While the 
slopes of the offer curves are positive, the curves are flatter at high levels of risk, 
implying that investments in reducing risk are relatively productive at high levels 
of risk. However, as risk levels are reduced, further investments in risk reduction 
technology eventually become relatively unproductive. 
 Risk reduction technology is reflected in the firm ’ s offer curves. By contrast, 
the preferences of employees are reflected in the indifference curves.   Figure 15.1  
shows two indifference curves. The indifference curves also have positive slopes, 
but in contrast to offer curves, the wage-risk gradient becomes very steep as the 
risk is increased beyond some level. This means that at relatively high levels of 
risk, workers require a highly increased wage differential to compensate them for 
bearing an additional unit of risk (e.g., an additional 0.01 probability of being the 
victim of a fatal on-the-job accident). The optimal points are at wage-risk levels at 
which the marginal rate of substitution between goods (wages) and risk is equal to 
the marginal rate at which reduced risk is translated into lower wages, that is, 
where the slopes of the two types of curves are the same. 
 More formally,  2 the worker maximizes expected utility through the 
following: 
 Z = (1  –  Θ ) U ( w ) +  Θ V ( w ), 
(15.1) 
 where U(w) is the utility of consumption (wages) in the healthy state, V(w) is the 
utility of consumption in the sick state — the health state after an accident occurs —
 and  Θ is the probability of the accident occurring. For a given amount of wage 
compensation, total utility U is definitely higher than total utility V. However, the 
marginal utility of a unit of wage compensation in the healthy versus the marginal 
utility of a unit of such compensation in the sick state cannot be determined from 
theory alone. Both marginal utilities are plausibly positive. The slope of the work-
er ’ s indifference curve is given by equation 15.2, which is a first-order condition:

 The change in wage rate per unit change in the probability of an accident, 
 dw / d Θ , is larger when the difference in total utility between the healthy and the 
sick states is larger — the numerator of equation 15.2 is larger, other factors being 
equal. The worker demands a higher wage for a given level of risk when the utility 
loss from having the accident is greater, which is plausible. For a given difference 
between  U and  V ,  dw / d Θ is larger when the marginal utilities of  w are lower. These 
marginal utilities are in the denominator of equation 15.2. When the worker derives

less added enjoyment from consuming additional goods, the worker in essence 
places a higher weight on having a relatively safe job at a lower wage, and con-
versely for a higher marginal utility of consumption. The level of  Θ also matters. 
If  Θ increases and  V ′ ( w ) is high relative to  U ′ ( w ), the unit increase in  Θ will result 
in a lower  dw / d Θ compared to a situation in which  V ′ ( w ) is low relative 
to  U ′ ( w ). 
 The estimated wage-risk trade-off  w ( Θ ) does not indicate how a  particular 
worker must be compensated for nonmarginal changes in risk. The two indifference 
curves in  figure 15.1  are for two different workers with different preferences. The 
points of tangency are at different marginal rates of substitution between wage 
compensation and job-related risk. 
 What  is  observed in the data are points of tangency of the two types of curves. 
We observe, after worker-job matching, firm- or establishment-level observations 
on wage rates and job risk. The parameters of an equation such as 15.3 are 
estimated.

 The relationship depicted by equation 15.3 represents an average of marginal

wage compensation for reductions in the probability of a job-related accident or 
injury) who select different combinations of wages and risk. 
 The use of the natural logarithm (ln) of the wage is commonplace in empirical 
research on wages. Other things being equal, higher levels of human capital should 
result in higher wages. The variable  X includes various job characteristics, such 
as health and life insurance benefits and vacation days offered by the employer. 
If the employer provides generous workers compensation benefits that are pay-
able in the event that a job-related injury or fatality occurs, the wage should be 
lower. Measures of risk ( Θ ,    Ω ) include rates of injury and fatalities or workers ’

sub jective beliefs about this risk if subjective beliefs differ from their objective 
counterparts. 
 There are several econometric problems that arise in estimating the param-
eters of equations like equation 15.3 using regression analysis. Since our focus is 
not on econometrics but rather on conceptual issues in the revealed preference 
approach, we will mention only the problems and not go into detail about solution 
methods. 
 One problem is that job-related risks are endogenous to wages. Both 
wages and risks are jointly determined, that is, determined at the same time. Rather 
than having the worker ’ s wage on the left side of the equation, it would be as rea-
sonable to put a job-related risk variable on the left side of the equation and regress 
it on wages and other factors as it is to estimate equation 15.3. This violates an 
important assumption of regression analysis, namely, that causation unambigu-
ously runs from the variable on the right side of the equation to the variable on 
the left side. While causation runs in this direction, wages affect job risk as well. 
This issue arises in many other empirical applications discussed in this book 
as well. 
 Another and perhaps more serious problem in this application is that workers 
differ in ways not measured in the data, which is called  omitted heterogeneity . For 
this reason, researchers may not observe a trade-off between wages and job-related 
risk. Rather than a positive relationship being observed between these variables 
(i.e., wages rise when risk rises), a negative relationship may be observed. Particu-
larly capable, industrious, or well-connected workers in ways unobservable to the 
researcher and therefore not accounted for in the statistical analysis may obtain 
jobs with  both  high wages and low risk. Even if a positive relationship is observed, 
the estimated parameter may be biased. Economists deal with this issue by using 
longitudinal data on the same individuals. With such data, one can specify a vari-
able to capture differences among individuals that do not vary for an individual 
over time (e.g., manual dexterity) in the sample, and hopefully capture factors that 
are unmeasured in the data sets but are important wage determinants and may be 
correlated with the risk at the job the worker selected. 
 Value of a Statistical Life 
 Researchers have used parameter estimates for  γ 1 and  γ 2 in equation 15.3 to derive 
VSL and life year values. If wages rise by a dollar per increase of 0.0001 per year 
in the probability of dying from a job-related accident or illness, then one can 
readily compute the implied value of life and of a life year (divide 0.0001 into 1). 
This has been done in numerous studies. 
 An alternative is to compute the VSL from other decisions, such as the effect 
of safety equipment on automobile prices. According to  Viscusi and Aldy (2003 ), 
estimates of the value of a life from US market data range from US$5 to US$12 million 

666 
 Part IV / Chapter 15
per statistical life (2000 US$). There are considerably fewer studies of value of a 
statistical life outside the United States. Canada ranks next in terms of number of 
studies. In general, the estimated value of a life varies with income.  Viscusi and Aldy 
(2003 ) estimated that the VSL has an income elasticity of about 0.5 to 0.6, implying 
that a 10 percent increase in a country ’ s per capita income increases the valuation of 
a life by 5 to 6 percent. Not surprisingly, individuals who live in more affluent coun-
tries are the ones to emphasize the value of risk reduction from all sources. 
 While this is what the data show, the normative implications of this finding 
may be somewhat disconcerting. The finding implies that a life is more valuable 
in a high-income country than in a middle- or low-income country. Decision 
makers charged with the responsibility for allocating funds for international aid 
may not want to place full or partial reliance on this finding in many allocation 
decisions. 
 An Application of the Revealed Preference Approach: Cigarette 
Smokers as Job Risk Takers 
 Viscusi and Hersch (2001)  focused on the preferences of cigarette smokers, the risks 
of the jobs in which they are employed, and why smokers are paid lower compen-
sating wage differentials for assuming additional job-related risk when compared 
to others. Smokers select jobs in industries in which the risk of an accident or 
illness is greater, but given the lower wage-risk trade-off faced by smokers, their 
total compensation is lower nevertheless. The standard approach outlined above 
assumes that worker preferences affect workers ’ choice of job from the offer curve 
(the OC curves in   fig. 15.1 ), but that differences in preferences do not affect the 
offer curve itself. If the wage premium for assuming higher job-related risk is lower 
for smokers than for nonsmokers, using the method for calculating the value of life 
described above, the estimated value of a statistical life for smokers will be lower 
for smokers than for nonsmokers. 
 It is not at all surprising that smokers have different preferences from non-
smokers. One reason why smokers continue to smoke (at least ex ante, before the 
health loss is actually experienced) is that nonsmokers believe they will have less 
utility in the sick than in the healthy state, but the loss they expect to experience 
is lower for smokers than for nonsmokers. In fact, there is some empirical evidence 
that adult smokers are willing to pay less to avoid poor health than are adult non-
smokers ( Khwaja, Sloan, and Wang 2009 ). If so, it is not at all surprising that 
smokers would locate themselves on an offer curve at a higher wage-risk combina-
tion than others. 
 As seen in   figure 15.1 , the positive slope of the offer curve becomes flatter at 
higher levels of job risk, and if the tangency between a worker ’ s indifference curve 
and the firm ’ s offer curve occurs there, the slope at the point of tangency will 
be flatter. This is case 1 in   figure 15.2 . But this does not explain the anomaly 

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis 
 667
that smokers do not get paid as much for assuming the same level of risk as 
nonsmokers.  
 A second possibility is that the offer curve is lower for smokers than for 
nonsmokers but the two curves are parallel, as shown in case 2 in   figure 15.2 . 
Smokers may be paid less because their marginal productivity is lower on average, 
even after controlling for several worker characteristics, such as in equation 15.3. 
Empirical evidence based on US Social Security earnings history data suggests that 
this is true ( Sloan, Ostermann, Picone, et al. 2004 ). With a number of other earnings 
determinants held constant, smokers earned less on average. 
 A third possibility is that although the offer curve faced by smokers is lower 
at low levels of job risk, at some point the offer curve for smokers becomes higher 
than the offer curve for smokers, as in case 3. Although a conceptual possibility,

this pattern of offer curves, however, is inconsistent with the empirical evidence 
on smokers ’ versus nonsmokers ’ wage-job risks. 
 Fourth, the offer curve facing smokers may be everywhere below the offer 
curve facing nonsmokers, but unlike in case 2, it becomes relatively flatter at higher 
levels of job risk, which is case 4. Like case 2, case 4 is consistent with empirical 
evidence. 
 Using a national sample of persons in the United States in 1987, found in the 
National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES),  Viscusi and Hersch (2001)  docu-
mented that smokers in their sample had lower mean wages, tended be slightly 
older (though less than a year older on average), had lower educational attainment 
(more than a year less on average), had longer job-related experience but lower 
tenure at their current jobs, were more likely to have a physical condition that 
limited work, were much less likely to be in a white-collar job, experienced a higher 
number of lost workdays, had a higher job-related injury rate, and were more likely 
to have experienced an injury off the job than were nonsmokers. Thus, smokers 
not only assumed a higher risk by smoking but were more accident-prone on and 
off the job. One can see why employers might offer smokers lower wages, given 
their higher rate of work absences, for one, and why they might be less willing to 
offer a wage premium to smokers than to nonsmokers. 
 Viscusi and Hersch (2001 ) regressed the natural logarithm of the wage rate 
on job risk and others factors, using a specification similar to equation 15.3, sepa-
rately for smokers and nonsmokers. The results showed that the wage premium 
nonsmokers received for taking a riskier job was much higher than for the wage 
premium received by smokers. Further, the wages of nonsmokers were not affected 
by whether or not the worker had been injured on the job in the preceding year. 
However, in the analysis of smokers ’ wages, persons who had experienced an injury 
during the preceding year were paid less in the year after the injury occurred. This 
result is consistent with the view that employers regarded smokers as being more 
careless for a given risk level in a particular industry. 
 However, the authors conceded that the pattern of results is open to other 
interpretations as well. Perhaps, for example, smokers were employed in settings 
in which injuries, when they occurred, tended to be more disabling. The authors 
lacked the data to distinguish among these alternative interpretations. 
 Another finding was that smokers earned less in jobs in which the risk of 
injury was zero. This result, in combination with the results for the higher wages 
obtained by nonsmokers versus smokers for risk bearing, suggests that the valid 
case is case 4 — an offer curve with a lower intercept and slope for smokers than 
for nonsmokers. 
 This study ’ s findings are interesting in their own right, but the findings also 
offer important implications for the use of the revealed preference approach as 
the basis for assessing the VSL. Clearly, there is heterogeneity in tastes among 

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis 
 669
individuals. Thus, even if the offer curves were the same, the points of tangency 
imply differences in the VSL. In some applications, applying the same value to all 
people should not result in misleading inferences. However, in others — say, in 
assessing the benefits of a smoking cessation program versus a program to provide 
colorectal screening to adults — using the same VSL is likely to result in misleading 
comparisons. The fact that the offer curves are likely to vary adds another important 
complication. If people differ in their compensation opportunities, the above ana-
lytic framework for obtaining VSL estimates breaks down. For example, if smokers 
had the same job opportunities as nonsmokers did, they may have made different 
choices and hence been located at different wage-risk combinations in the data. 
Next, we consider an alternative approach to valuing health benefits of programs. 
Yet in the end, no single approach is perfect. 
 15.3 
 The Stated Preference Approach 
 The stated preference approach often uses questioning methods such as  “ Would 
you pay $ X for . . . ? ” and  “ Which of the following alternatives do you prefer? ” to 
elicit WTP for life extension, a higher quality of life, or the cure of a specific 
disease, although these particular example questions are in a simplified form. 
There are three broad categories of stated preference questions: contingent valua-
tion (CV) questions, stated choice of attribute-based questions, and contingent 
behavior or contingent activity questions.  3 
 Stated preference approaches are highly controversial,  4 in part because they 
have been used to measure damages in litigation and to set a regulatory standard, 
which persons employed by sectors negatively affected by the regulations often 
oppose for reasons of self interest. But even when used purely for academic pur-
poses, stated preference has encountered substantial criticism, mainly because of 
its hypothetical questioning rather than reliance on actual decisions made, as in 
the revealed preference approach. In response to various specific criticisms, 
researchers have substantially improved methods used to elicit values from surveys. 
In reviewing the criticisms,  Freeman (2003 , 183) states,  “ My own assessment of SP 
(stated preference) methods is cautiously optimistic. . . . It is hard to do a SP study 
well. There is no substitute for a careful reading in the now substantial and rapidly 
growing literature. ” 
 Contingent Valuation 
 In the CV approach, respondents are asked about monetary values for a specific 
nonmarket good, such as a type of personal health or a specific improved environ-
mental outcome or the maximum amount the person would be willing to pay for 
a specific change to occur, such as a reduction in waiting time of one month. Some

 Part IV / Chapter 15
CV-type surveys have open-ended questions about maximum WTP rather than 
precoded monetary values from among which the respondent chooses. Open-ended 
questions allow respondents to give responses other those prespecified. On the 
other hand, some respondents may give wild and implausible answers to open-
ended questions. 
 Another CV approach asks the respondent whether or not he or she would 
be willing to pay $ X for an outcome. With this approach, one obtains only an upper 
or lower bound on maximum WTP — an upper bound if the person says no and a 
lower bound if the person says yes. In more sophisticated variants of this approach, 
people who say no to the first question are asked a second question with a lower 
value. The value is lowered in successive questions until the person finally 
says yes. After a yes is obtained, the next question is for a value between the last 
and second-to-last questions. Questions about values in increasingly small inter-
vals are asked until successive yes answers or no answers are obtained that 
the midpoint between the two values yields a sufficiently precise estimate of 
maximum WTP. 
 A potential problem in CV studies is starting point bias. Such bias occurs to 
the extent that the value at which the questioning starts influences the final result. 
The reason is that respondents often anchor their answers on the first value men-
tioned in a series of questions. This problem may be reduced by randomizing 
starting values. Thus, even if each final value is influenced by the starting value, 
by randomizing starting values and having many survey respondents, this problem 
should be of minimal importance. 
 Using a series of yes-no questions and iterating to a final value should yield 
more valid and reliable estimates of maximum WTP than using open-ended ques-
tions, partially because people are used to making choices on a take-it-or-leave-it 
basis. Additionally, it is easier to answer yes or no than to give a monetary value 
for a good that one rarely or never purchases. The line of questioning with yes-no 
answers is incentive compatible. It is easiest to give a truthful answer. With an 
open-ended maximum WTP question, there is more room for respondent 
strategizing. 
 Nevertheless, two major concerns with the CV method remain. First, people 
may be cognitively unable to deal with complex trade-offs such as those embodied 
in surveys eliciting WTP, and individuals are likely to vary substantially in terms 
of their ability to evaluate trade-offs. For these reasons, it is a good idea to measure 
the individual ’ s cognitive ability during the survey and adjust the responses in 
some manner based on measured cognitive ability. Widely accepted and used 
survey questions for assessing cognition exist. 
 A second concern with CV, as well as the other stated preference approaches, 
is the hypothetical nature of questions used to elicit WTP in lieu of inferring WTP 
from actual transactions; hypothetical questions can often provide incredibly 
inflated values of maximum WTP. To assess the credibility of the responses, it is 

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis 
 671
useful to compute WTP based on different types of CV questions. We describe 
below an actual application of the CV approach that did this. In some cases, it may 
be possible to compare results from a revealed preference with values obtained 
from the CV approach. 
 Stated Choice or Attribute-Based Methods 
 An alternative to CV is to give respondents a set of hypothetical alternatives 
and ask them to select the most preferred alternative or to rate the alternatives 
on some scale according to the extent to which an alternative is preferred or not. 
Based on the responses, the researcher can infer the marginal rate of substitution 
between any pair of attributes that are different for the two alternatives. If one of 
the alternatives is money, it is possible to compute the respondent ’ s maximum 
WTP for the attribute based on the responses. These methods are used extensively 
in environmental economics applications but much less frequently by health 
economists. 
 Contingent Behavior or Contingent Activity Questions 
 In a third approach, individuals are asked how they would change the level of 
some activity in response to a change in the level of a nonmarket good, such as 
fishing if the quality of the water in a lake were improved. If the activity can be 
valued in monetary terms, such as the cost of travel to the lake, the method can be 
used to obtain an estimate of maximum WTP. If, for example, the respondent would 
fish once a year with water as it is but would fish three days annually if the water 
quality were improved, and if the person lives an hour away from the lake, one 
can infer a value from the amount the person is willing to pay to get to and spend 
time at the lake and fish, as well as the fees for fishing once there. 
 This approach may be used in health applications, but to date it has been 
mainly used in environmental economics applications. The approach has the 
advantage of explicitly considering the role of prices and in this sense is nearest 
to revealed preference; however, the situations posed are hypothetical, whereas 
revealed preference is based on actual choices. 
 Assessing the Validity of Stated Preference Measures 
 The quality of any survey may be gauged in terms of its validity and reliability. 
Validity refers to the extent to which a question or set of questions accurately 
measures what it is designed to measure, in this context, maximum WTP. For 
example, how do the survey findings compare with results of an actual randomized 
controlled experiment (that is, if comparable results from such an experiment are 
available)? There is some evidence that CV-based values are often too high. If there 
is a case in which an apples-to-apples comparison between a CV-based and an 
experiment-based value can be made, then the differential could be used to adjust 
CV-based values in other applications. Or if an experiment is not available, a 

672 
 Part IV / Chapter 15
CV-generated value could be compared with a result based on the revealed prefer-
ence approach. 
 Another way to judge validity is to compare results based on a variable for 
which economic theory can provide some guidance. For example, if the value of 
life year is a normal good, we would expect maximum WTP for an extra life year 
to rise with increases in personal income. If a particular CV survey yields this 
result, this can be taken as some indication that the survey results are valid. Finally, 
one can compare how a particular survey was done with best survey practices, 
such as how scenarios on which WTP questions were based were specified, how 
values were elicited, incentives respondents had to reveal their true underlying 
preferences, and how the analysis was conducted. 
 Survey reliability concerns the ability of a well-designed survey to yield 
accurate estimates of the underlying value of the population being interviewed. If, 
for example, the sample size is small, mean values and standard deviations of such 
values may vary substantially, depending on the persons selected for the 
interviews. 
 To illustrate how stated preference analysis is conducted in practice, we 
describe three actual studies in some detail. 
 Stated Preference Method Application 1 
 Krupnick, Alberini, Cropper, et al. (2002 ) reported the results of a CV survey of 
930 persons in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, aged 40 – 74, who were surveyed to elicit 
WTP for mortality risk reductions. The authors accounted for potential deficiencies 
of past CV studies in designing their survey. One concern was that respondents 
might not have understood the risk changes they were being asked to value. To 
help individuals understand risk changes, the authors showed respondents graphs 
with 1,000 cells, the cells corresponding to persons who died shaded as shown in 
 figure 15.3 . Risk changes were displayed to respondents by changing the number 
of shaded cells in the grid. Tests of respondents ’ ability to deal with probabilities 
when shown the grid showed that for the vast majority of respondents, comprehen-
sion of probabilities was good.  
 Another potential problem is that survey respondents may not have believed 
that the risk changes or baseline risks applied to them. Like parents who believe 
that their children are all above average (called the Lake Wobegon phenomenon in 
the United States), people may think that while others are subject to specific risks, 
for one reason or another (e.g.,  “ my grandfather smoked cigars and drank a liter of 
beer every evening but lived to be 90, ” at the same time forgetting that the other 
grandfather died suddenly of a heart attack at age 48), people may reason that the 
risks do not really apply to them. To deal with this issue, respondents were explic-
itly asked to assume that the risks in the survey questions applied to them. 
 A third issue is that respondents may have lacked experience in trading 
money for quantitative risk changes or failed to have engaged in the particular 

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis 
 673
activity. To help respondents make such trade-offs, respondents were told about 
risk reductions for common diagnostic tests, such as for mammograms and drugs 
to reduce high blood pressure. To deal with the issue that people might not be able 
to deal with changes in very small probabilities of an adverse outcome, respondents 
were asked to value changes in probabilities of risk over a 10-year time frame. The 
advantage of a 10-year period is that probabilities in the questions were ten times 
larger than they would have been had the questions applied to the probability of 
an adverse outcome occurring in a single year. Since the sequence of questions 
could affect the answers, the order of risk scenarios was varied. Some persons were 
asked if they were willing to pay for a product that, when used and paid for over 
10 years, would reduce baseline risk by five in 10,000 annually or by five in 1,000 
in 10 years. In a second set of WTP questions, the risks were reduced by a factor 
of five. Other persons were asked these questions in reverse order. 
 The survey revealed that WTP for mortality risk reduction is constant up to 
age 70 with reductions of about 30 percent in WTP for persons above this age. This 
is undoubtedly due to the fact that older persons face a much higher probability 
of dying in a specific time period than younger individuals do. Likewise, the WTP 
did not vary much according to the respondent ’ s physical health status. A given 
reduction in risk is much lower as a percentage of an older person ’ s or a sicker

person ’ s mortality risk than for a younger or healthy person. That age and physical 
health did not have a greater impact on WTP is surprising. 
 The authors concluded that it is inappropriate to compute the value of a life 
year from a value of life, or to use life year values to compute program benefit. 
Since older persons have fewer expected life years, holding other factors constant, 
the program benefit would be lower when applied to older persons. While the 
authors ’  argument logically follows from their finding on WTP and age, it seems 
extreme to assign the same benefit of a program that cures disease  X for person A, 
who has disease  X and is expected to live for many years even with the disease, 
and person B, who also has disease  Y , which is expected to kill person B within 
two weeks unless he or she receives a (rapid) cure. For this reason, it makes more 
sense to use life years than a value of life in calculating benefit. 
 Mean WTP for a reduction of risk of five in 10,000 per annum was only 1.6 
times the WTP for an annual risk reduction of one in 10,000. Thus, WTP seems to 
be highly sensitive to the magnitude of the risk reduction under consideration. 
 Stated Preference Method Application 2 
 Multiple sclerosis is a serious neurological disease that often first affects people in 
early adulthood. Depending on its severity, multiple sclerosis can cause substantial 
pain and immobility. Furthermore, for many persons with the disease, the symp-
toms are intermittent, making it hard for them to predict how well they will feel 
on a given day. There is currently no cure, and medical care for the disease 
is expensive. Also, many persons incur expenditures for special equipment, 
including specially equipped motor vehicles for their transportation, and some-
times there are expenditures for alterations of the home. Additional costs may 
occur because many patients are dependent on help from paid and unpaid caregiv-
ers. Financial outlays for multiple sclerosis have been estimated by  Whetten-
Goldstein, Sloan, Goldstein, et al. (1998) . However, nonfinancial or intangible loss 
(loss attributable to pain and suffering) is also likely to be substantial.  Sloan, 
Viscusi, Chesson, et al. (1998)  used stated preference approaches to estimate the 
value of such loss. 
 The authors used two alternative methods for eliciting estimates of intangible 
loss: risk-dollar and risk-risk, the latter being the standard gamble approach that 
was briefly described in chapter 14. 
 Theory: Risk-Dollar Trade-offs 
 Let  U ( Y ) be the utility of a healthy individual, where  Y represents consumption or 
income (with a zero rate of savings). Let  V ( Y ) be the utility of a sick individual. 
For any level of  Y , total utility when healthy exceeds total utility when sick,  U ( Y ) 
 >  V ( Y ). Assume that there are two communities, a and b, each with a different 
probability of acquiring a specific disease. Let  Θ a and  Θ b indicate the probability 
of getting sick in each of the two communities. Let  c a be the cost of living in 

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis 
 675
community a and  c b be cost of living in community b. To simplify the analysis, set 
 c a to zero; then let  c b vary, so that equation 15.4 is satisfied: 
 Θ b V ( Y  –  c b ) +(1  –  Θ b ) U ( Y  –  c b ) =  Θ a V ( Y ) + (1  –  Θ a ) U ( Y ).  
(15.4) 
 Theory: Risk-Risk Trade-offs 
 Risk-risk trade-offs were explained as the standard gamble in chapter 14. With this 
approach, the researcher finds the probability of dying instantly and painlessly 
from a surgical procedure that, if successful, completely cures a person of a disease. 
When the person is cured, he or she has the utility function for the health state. 
Once we know the value of the probability of death that makes the person indif-
ferent between having the operation and not having the operation, we can compute 
total utility in the sick state from the product of (1  –  Θ ) and total utility in the 
healthy state. 
 In some applications, if we have an estimate of the value of life that reflects 
utility in the healthy state and one minus the probability of dying during the opera-
tion painlessly, we can compute utility in the sick state as the product of the value 
of life and one minus the probability of dying during the operation. People who 
have a relatively low utility in the sick state compared to their utility in the healthy 
state will be willing to bear a higher risk of surgery. That is, for diseases that cause 
a lot of pain, suffering, and disability, people can be expected to be willing to 
expose themselves to greater mortality risk from the surgical procedure in order to 
obtain a cure. 
 Surveys of WTP to Avoid Intangible Loss of Multiple Sclerosis 
 Surveys were conducted of 292 persons at a shopping center in Greensboro, North 
Carolina, USA. None of these persons had multiple sclerosis. In addition, inter-
views were conducted with forty-three patients who had multiple sclerosis in two 
North Carolina counties. Since the interviews were conducted in person, sicker 
individuals were less likely to have been willing to participate. 
 Each survey respondent was randomly assigned to one of four videotapes 
describing the life of person with multiple sclerosis. Since there is so much het-
erogeneity in the severity of this disease, it was important that all sample persons 
have the scenario on the videotape in mind in responding to the survey questions. 
People were asked to focus on the disease scenarios, not on their personal health 
in responding to the WTP questions. Respondents were asked to assume that all 
monetary loss associated with the type of multiple sclerosis depicted in the sce-
nario the respondent was shown was covered in full by a health insurance policy. 
 Table 15.1  shows the risk-dollar and risk-risk questions as presented to 
respondents. For the risk-dollar set of questions, respondents were asked to assume 
that the cost of living in the first area was the same as in the respondent ’ s own 
area. The second area had a higher cost of living but a lower risk of getting multiple 

676 
 Part IV / Chapter 15
sclerosis. The probabilities of getting multiple sclerosis were stated to be 40 out of 
a million and 30 out of a million in the two communities, respectively. These are 
very low probabilities, but realistic in terms of the actual probability of getting 
multiple sclerosis. 
 The table shows the first round of questions. The cost of living differential 
was randomly assigned to each individual, not a set amount as in the table. If the 
higher cost of living community was initially selected, the cost of living differential 
was raised until the person stated that he or she would select the other community. 
The cost of living differential in the question was varied until the survey was able 
to determine with considerable accuracy what the cost of living difference was that 
made the respondent indifferent between living in each of the two communities. 
The cost of living difference for that person was taken at the midpoint of a cost of 
living differential that caused the person to prefer each of the two communities. If 
the respondent placed a higher value on the intangible loss from multiple sclerosis 
of the type the respondent viewed, the monetary value of the difference in cost 
of living between the two communities that made the person indifferent was 
deemed to be higher, and conversely for those who placed a lower value on the 
intangible loss.

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis

 For the risk-risk questions, to avoid starting point bias, respondents were 
initially given a probability of dying during surgery selected at random (e.g., 0.15 
as in   table 15.1 ). The probability of dying was varied until the probability yielding 
a yes, willing to undergo the operation, and the probability yielding a no to this 
question was very small. The midpoint of this interval was taken as the probability 
of death that the person was willing to accept that made him or her indifferent 
between having the surgery and facing the prospect of a healthy life versus refusing 
surgery and living the rest of life in the sick state. 
 Results 
 There was substantial variation in the risk-dollar analysis in the implied WTP to 
avoid a case of multiple sclerosis. Overall, respondents who actually had multiple 
sclerosis had a much higher WTP to avoid getting multiple sclerosis than did 
persons who did not have the disease. The implied WTPs to not get multiple scle-
rosis were $10.5 million for persons without the disease and $22.0 million for those 
with the disease. Both values exceeded most VSL estimates. While it is possible 
that some people regard having multiple sclerosis as worse than being dead, this 
is not the assumption that health services researchers and economists make when 
using QALY or when analyzing utility change based on a standard gamble question. 
A QALY of 0 is dead. If the subject is alive, the QALY is constrained to be above 
0 and less than or equal to 1. Another possibility, discussed below, is that the high 
values placed on avoiding multiple sclerosis reflected survey respondents ’ risk 
misperceptions. If respondents considered the difference in risk between the two 
communities as larger than was stated by the probabilities in the question, then 
the final cost-of-living difference should be too high. Although most people know 
what a million is, thinking about what 30 out of a million really means may be 
very demanding cognitively. 
 As with the responses to the risk-dollar questions, there was considerable 
variation in responses to the risk-risk questions as well. Here respondents with 
multiple sclerosis were much more reluctant to undergo the operation, which 
implies that such persons attach a much lower utility loss to having the disease 
than others do. The median value of  Θ * for persons with multiple sclerosis was 
0.18, while for the general population the median value was more than twice this 
value, 0.45. Multiplying either estimate by VSL values from the literature yielded 
values of maximum WTP to avoiding getting multiple sclerosis that were far lower 
than those obtained from responses to the risk-dollar questions. 
 Two of the findings indicated that respondents misperceived the risk of 
getting multiple sclerosis from the risk-dollar questions. First, the estimates of 
maximum WTP were implausibly high. The second was the different relative 
values obtained on the risk-dollar and the risk-risk questions. 
 The authors used nonlinear regression to recover a parameter representing 
the factor by which respondents overestimated the probability of getting multiple 

678 
 Part IV / Chapter 15
sclerosis. (The analytic approach used is beyond the scope of this discussion.) For 
persons without multiple sclerosis, the authors estimated that the probability of 
getting multiple sclerosis in the risk-dollar analysis was overestimated by a factor 
of 30 to 39. That is, the probability of getting multiple sclerosis, 0.000030 in one 
community, was treated as if it was 0.0009 (if the misperception factor is 30). For 
persons with multiple sclerosis, the factor ranged from 47 to 71, far higher than 
for persons without the disease. It is quite possible that because they actually had 
the disease, persons with multiple sclerosis tended to overestimate the probability 
in their own thought processes by even more than respondents from the general 
population did. 
 Correcting for misperception of risk, the estimates of intangible loss using 
responses from both the risk-dollar and the risk-risk questions ranged from 
US$346,000 to US $510,000 for the general population and from US $375,000 to 
US$881,000 for persons with multiple sclerosis. These values are far below VSLs 
reported in the literature and are plausible in this respect. 
 The authors conducted several tests of consistency of responses. For one, the 
correlation between responses from the risk-dollar and risk-risk questions was 0.72, 
which is fairly high. The survey asked respondents to rate various symptoms of 
multiple sclerosis on a scale. Persons with the disease were able to discriminate 
among the symptoms in terms of their relative severity much better than the other 
respondents were. 
 Implications 
 Benefits and costs in CBA take a societal perspective. In decisions on how much 
to allocate to research and development for disease prevention, diagnosis, and 
treatment, analysts must consider potential benefits as accruing to every member 
of society, not just to those with the disease. Such analysis is inherently future-
oriented, and thus includes benefits to those who do not currently have the disease 
but may get it in the future. By contrast, in decisions about whether or not a par-
ticular patient should receive a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, the benefit is 
the benefit to that particular patient. For the type of study just described, the rel-
evant preferences are those of the general population. Yet, as just acknowledged, 
those with the disease are likely to know more about the disease in question than 
others do. If their knowledge were superior in all respects and there were no gaming 
in the responses — in the sense that persons with multiple sclerosis may reason that 
if they state the losses are high, they will garner more support for public investment 
in treating the disease — perhaps the analyst should base the benefit calculation on 
these persons ’ responses to WTP questions. 
 In this application, the multiple sclerosis patients were not uniformly more 
knowledgeable. In fact, they overestimated the probability of getting multiple scle-
rosis by an even larger factor than did respondents from the general population. 
 Another issue relates to  Viscusi and Aldy ’ s (2003 ) conclusion that VSL esti-
mates vary positively with personal income. Might reliance on WTP studies not 

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis

bias the allocation of public expenditures in favor of the rich? In the multiple 
sclerosis study, higher-income persons had higher estimates of intangible loss in 
one regression but not in the other two. To the extent that the estimated loss is 
higher for persons with higher income, it is possible to adjust for income to elimi-
nate the effect of income on the loss estimates. Also, any bias toward allocating 
public funds in favor of the rich can be offset in large part by progressive taxation 
of personal income. 
 Stated Preference Application 3: Benefits and Costs of 
Cholera Vaccination 
 Background and Study Rationale 
 Cholera has a high incidence in some low-income countries and is the source of 
much morbidity. Cholera is transmitted through contaminated water. It causes 
dehydration, but with proper treatment, death rates are low (around one percent) 
A new generation of cholera vaccines provides an alternative approach to improv-
ing water supplies in areas with unsafe water. Beira, Mozambique, a city of about 
550,000 on the coast of southern East Africa, has experienced a number of cholera 
epidemics. In general, the life expectancy at birth in Mozambique is 31 years. 
 Jeuland, Lucas, Clemens, et al. (2009 ) conducted a CBA to determine whether or 
not a two-dose oral cholera vaccination technology should be adopted, and if so, 
how the vaccination program should be designed. 
 The authors evaluated three options. Option 1 was a school-based vaccination 
program for schoolchildren aged 5 to 14. Option 2 involved school-based vaccina-
tion of all eligible children aged 1 to 14, and option 3 was a community-based 
vaccination of all eligible people more than one year old. For medical reasons, the 
vaccine cannot be administered to persons younger than one. Children have the 
highest incidence of cholera and face the highest probability of death, conditional 
on having the disease. Option 3 was the most expensive option, and it also poten-
tially involved the most implementation problems in that the schools are likely to 
be an efficient venue for administered the vaccine. Yet limiting the vaccinated 
population to children would exclude adults with a relatively high WTP for the 
cholera vaccine. 
 Program Benefit and Cost 
 The authors specified three types of benefit of a vaccination program. The first is 
the private benefit from being vaccinated among persons who actually receive the 
vaccine. The second is the benefit that unvaccinated persons derive from the fact 
that some persons in the community get vaccinated. There is an externality in that 
persons who are vaccinated reduce the probability that an unvaccinated person 
will contract this infectious disease. There is an epidemiological concept termed 
 herd immunity . Herd immunity describes a type of immunity that occurs when 
the vaccination of a portion of the population (or herd) provides protection to 

680 
 Part IV / Chapter 15
unprotected individuals. Herd immunity theory proposes that in diseases passed 
from person to person, it is more difficult to maintain a chain of infection when 
large numbers of a population are immune. As the proportion of individuals who 
are immune rises, the likelihood that a susceptible person will come into contact 
with an infected individual falls. 
 The third benefit was specified as the discounted cost of illness incurred by 
government per case of illness. The vaccination program potentially reduces this 
burden on the public sector. 
 The cost in this benefit-cost analysis was the total monetary cost of vacci-
nation per person (including production, shipping, delivery, and the additional 
private cost of vaccination per person incurred from travel and waiting for vaccine). 
These costs per person vaccinated were multiplied by the number of persons 
vaccinated. 
 Measuring Private Benefit to the Vaccinated 
 The private benefit to persons receiving the vaccination conceptually can be esti-
mated from a private demand curve for vaccinations. Then the total private benefit 
to all persons who are vaccinated is the sum of their out-of-pocket expenditure on 
vaccinations (area A in   fig. 15.4 ), the magnitude of which itself is a policy variable, 
and the consumer surplus accruing to persons who get vaccinated (area B). Total 
private benefit can be expressed in per vaccinated person terms by dividing total 
private benefit by the total number of persons who are vaccinated (the sum of areas 
A and B).  
 Why would some persons be willing to pay more to be vaccinated than others? 
One reason might be that they are more affluent, and health and longevity are normal 
goods. Second, some people may believe that the probability of getting cholera is 
higher for themselves than for others and are willing to pay more for the vaccine for 
this reason. Conceptually, it seems likely that individual demand for the vaccine 
should depend on the percentage of persons in the area with immunity to cholera. 
In practice, the study on which Jeuland and co-authors relied for information on 
private vaccine WTP did not measure the effect of the probability of contracting 
cholera on private demand for the vaccine. Third, there is likely to be variation in 
how much loss of utility having cholera causes. Persons who experience more utility 
loss from having the disease should be willing to pay more for the vaccine, other 
factors being equal. Using the above notation, persons for whom  U ( Y )  –  V ( Y ) is large 
should be willing to pay more. Of course, consumption (a function of  Y ) could fall 
as a result of the disease as well, depressing utility in the sick state  V even more. 
 Use of Stated Preference Method to Measure Vaccine Demand 
 Demand curves are often estimated from observational data on market transactions. 
Price is varied across space or time (or both), and changes in quantity demanded 
are observed. Regression analysis is used to estimate the parameter relating 

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis

quantity demanded to price. These are applications of the revealed preference 
method. 
 Due to lack of market transactions data, one reason being that vaccines are 
often administered at a zero price to the person being vaccinated, Jeuland and co-
authors used evidence from a stated preference study of demand from another 
country. In such a study, one elicits WTP from respondents, an approach that is 
subject to the limitations described above. 
 Measuring Private Benefit to the Unvaccinated 
 The second component of program benefit is the benefit to the unvaccinated. As 
seen in   figure 15.4 , area C represents the maximum aggregate amount of benefit to 
those who chose not to be vaccinated at a price  p 1 . 
 Area C, however, overstates the benefit to the unvaccinated, for two reasons. 
First, the health benefit to the direct recipient of the vaccine must be greater than

or at least equal to the benefit to the unvaccinated. Thus, the triangle ’ s area 
may exceed the true aggregate benefit to the unvaccinated. Second, a point not 
made by the authors, some persons would demand the vaccine only at a negative 
price, that is, they would require a bribe to be vaccinated. Some reasons are concern 
about the adverse side effects of the vaccine, the time and inconvenience of getting 
vaccinated, and so on. Thus, unless the segment 0 x 2 represents the entire popula-
tion in the area, rather than 0 x 3 as   figure 15.4  is drawn, it seems likely that some 
persons would demand the vaccine only at a negative price. Then the negative 
triangle (area D) would have to be subtracted from area C, and the benefit would 
then be only some proportion   ρ of area C  – area D, or   ρ (area C  – area D), where 
0  <   ρ  ≤ 1. 
 Measuring Savings in Public Health Expenditures Attributable to 
the Vaccine Program 
 The third component of demand is the savings in public health expenditure attrib-
utable to the vaccination program. Such savings are negatively related to the per-
centage of the area population that receives the cholera vaccine. 
 Some Key Findings 
 Total benefit is then the sum of the three components, and cost is the full cost of 
the vaccination program under the various options the authors evaluated. In 
general, the vaccination programs proved to have benefit  – cost  > 0 and benefit/
cost  > 1. However, the differences and ratios depended critically on the present of 
herd immunity; without this externality, the differences and ratios were sometimes 
unfavorable to program adoption. (A negative difference mechanically translates 
into a benefit/cost ratio of  < 1). Second, although countries often distribute vaccines 
at zero money prices, the differences (ratios) critically depend on the level at which 
the administered (out-of-pocket) price  p 1 is set. In the study by Jeuland and col-
leagues, net benefit ( B  –  C ) was higher for  p 1  > 0. 
 Setting the price at a positive value ensures that the vaccine recipients will 
have higher WTP for the vaccine than the unvaccinated do. This results in a better 
allocation of scarce resources and is economically efficient for this reason. However, 
allocation by money price raises some equity concerns since persons with scant 
personal resources may predominate among the unvaccinated, although they 
benefit somewhat from herd immunity. Another advantage of charging a positive 
price is to obtain revenue to defray some of the cost of vaccine purchase and 
administration. 
 Although this is an excellent study overall, it clearly suffers from data limita-
tions, in particular in assessing benefits to the unvaccinated and in having to ignore 
the effect of infection probabilities on demand. Also, most economists would feel 
more comfortable with empirical evidence from revealed preference than stated 
preference on demand.

 Use of Cost-Benefit and Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis in Public Decision Making 
 The techniques described in this chapter and in chapter 14 are used in some coun-
tries as an aid to public policy decision making. Calculations of benefits versus the 
costs of regulation, including VSL as part of the benefit calculation, are used at 
various levels by the US government for assessing whether or not specific regula-
tions should be adopted at the federal level (  box 15.1 ).  
 The Department of Environment, Transport, and Regulation in the UK has 
also used VSL estimates in its benefit calculations. However, in contrast to the 
United States, where the revealed preference method is generally preferred for 
generating estimates of VSL, particularly outside the health field, there is greater 
reliance on contingent valuation in the UK, again outside the health field. Transport 
Canada also uses VSLs in the decision-making process, but it uses a range of values 
rather than a point estimate. 
 Various issues regarding the use of VSLs in designing public policy remain 
unresolved. For example, should the type of death (e.g., from cancer, from a motor 
vehicle accident) affect the VSL? In one sense, a death is a death. In another sense, 
some types of deaths may involve more pain and suffering or seem more unjust, 
or for some other reason society may place a relatively high value on preventing 
them. Do revealed preference estimates based on labor market data generalize to 
groups that are unlikely to be employed, such as the elderly? Several public agen-
cies use age-adjusted VSLs, but the use of age adjustment is controversial. Likewise, 
how should analysts adjust for the effect of income on VSL? 
 There are few public agencies with a focus on health that perform CEA or 
CBA analyses, and even then the emphasis is on cost-effectiveness rather than 
on costs versus benefits. The most notable example is the National Institute for 
Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK. NICE was established to provide guidance 
in decisions on the use of new and existing technologies. NICE ’ s conclusions 
are advisory to the British National Health Service (NHS) for NHS decisions 
about allocations of its resources. NICE operates independently of the NHS. In 
contrast to similar units in Australia and in Ontario, Canada, NICE is not a regula-
tory agency but rather provides guidance, which the recipients of the guidance can 
accept or reject. At the same time, NICE operates independently of manufacturers, 
but private money is used to sponsor NICE evaluations. NICE evaluates about 
thirty technologies annually from a pool of thousands of new and existing 
technologies. 5 
 NICE does not conduct original research but rather relies on empirical evi-
dence from existing studies. Evidence on the long-term effects of technologies is 
frequently unavailable, but, as described in chapter 14, methods for inferring long-
term effects from short-term transitions between health states exist and are widely 
5.  See, e.g.,  Birch and 
Gafni (2002)  for 
additional detail on 
NICE.

 Value of Life Estimates and Their Importance to Business 
 For the academic community, placing a value on human life is largely an intellectual 
matter, but for business, such calculations can have important financial implications. 
For example, a higher value of life may translate into a higher benefit from improving 
the quality of air. An article appeared on the front page of the  New York Times  on 
this topic on February 16, 2011 ( Appelbaum 2011).  The article describes how various 
US government agencies differ in the value they place on a life: $9.1 million — the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); $7.9 million — the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA); $6 million — the US Transportation Department. These values not 
only differ by agency, which is somewhat inexplicable, but they have risen apprecia-
bly in recent years. The EPA used values as low as $6.8 million under the previous 
US president. The FDA ’ s value was $5 million three years previously. The US Depart-
ment of Homeland Security has argued that the value of life lost to terrorism may be 
100 percent higher than for deaths from other causes. 
 Others have raised the possibility that the value of life may be higher for persons 
undergoing a slow death from cancer than a quick death in a motor vehicle accident. 
Then there is the idea that people are altruistic, placing a higher value on the common 
good than on their own survival. Of course, some experts may argue the opposite, 
that the value should be higher for risks to which the person is personally exposed 
rather than to abstract others. According to one economist cited in the article, the 
previous values used by US government agencies were too low. 
 Businesses have complained about the increases in values of life. Higher values on 
life saved translate into higher benefits from regulatory programs, such as regulations 
requiring cleaner air or stronger roofs on automobiles sold in the United States. Busi-
nesses have instead stressed the negative consequences of increased regulation that 
would result from these increased values of life rather than focusing on the validity of 
the values themselves. However, historically businesses have advocated use of CBA as 
a basis for deciding whether or not regulations should be adopted. The alternative is 
not no regulation or the imposition of regulatory standards without any specific con-
sideration of monetary benefits versus costs, but rather the adoption of regulation 
simply because it is likely to do some good, irrespective of what regulation costs. 
 While supporting the increased values of life, some consumer groups maintain 
that CBA fails to reflect some considerations. For example, one consumer advocate 
asked how one could put a price on global warming. The answer is that one could 
compute the benefits of damage averted by reducing global warming. Admittedly, 
since damage would only occur many years from now, the discounted present value 
of the benefit may be low — probably too low for some environmental advocates. 
 As an alternative to using a value-of-life estimate common to several types of regu-
latory decisions, such as air and water pollution, most US government agencies have 
relied on findings from surveys that asked respondents how much they would spend 
to avoid a specific risk. According to the  New York Times  article, this willingness-to-
pay technique tends to yield substantially lower values than those based on wages 
lost when a worker dies.  

Measuring Benefits and Cost-Benefit Analysis

used. Often, head-to-head comparisons of technologies designed for the same 
medical condition are unavailable. Thus, for example, it may not be possible to 
directly compare the benefits and costs of a new drug versus an established drug 
for treating a given condition. NICE has been criticized for placing undue emphasis 
on program cost, and in any case, NICE does not perform CBA. 
 Since 1993, the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee 
(PBAC) has reviewed every new drug on the basis of the drug ’ s cost-effectiveness 
before it can be added to the country ’ s national drug formulary. This agency uses 
a broad definition of costs, including medical, home health care, day care, special 
food, nursing, and physiotherapy costs, but it excludes indirect costs such as earn-
ings lost due to illness. New drugs are compared with the most commonly utilized 
existing drug, which provides the basis for computing the incremental cost-effec-
tiveness of the new drug. When appropriate, the comparator therapy may be a 
nonpharmaceutical treatment (e.g., surgery). The agency uses a discount rate of 5 
percent in its calculations. While cost-effectiveness is an important consideration 
in the decision to adopt a new drug, sometimes other considerations intrude, 
reflecting, among other things, strong lobbying on the part of special interest groups 
such as pharmaceutical manufacturers or on the part of patient groups who are 
potential users of the new technology. 
 Incremental cost-effectiveness is highly dependent on drug price, and the 
Australian government negotiates drug prices with manufacturers. Nevertheless, 
as discussed in chapter 14, the use of product prices has been criticized on the 
grounds that such prices may greatly exceed marginal cost. On the other hand, a 
small country like Australia is a drug importer, and the drug ’ s price represents an 
opportunity cost to the public sector. What the government pays for a drug is money 
that cannot be used for another public purpose. In this sense, use of drug prices is 
appropriate. While the main emphasis is on pharmaceutical technologies, the 
PBAC has assessed some non-drug technologies as well. 
 The most ambitious attempt to use these technologies was by the US state of 
Oregon (see  Kaplan 1995 ). For a while, Oregon attempted to allocate all of its 
Medicaid program resources on the basis of comparative cost-effectiveness. Med-
icaid is a federal-state program, and the federal government ultimately prevented 
Medicaid from allocating resources on the basis of relative cost-effectiveness. 
Among the major objections to the Oregon program was that it discriminated 
against persons with disabilities. 
 For example, suppose that a person is wheelchair-bound. Then the quality of 
the person ’ s life year is less than one. As a result, any program that targets such 
people will get a lower score than a program that targets young and healthy people. 
We leave it to our readers to judge whether or not this is a fundamental flaw of 
CEA or CBA. At a practical level, allocating  all resources on the basis of such 
analysis is a virtual nightmare. The requisite information on many, if not most, 
technologies is simply not available, necessitating the use of many  “ fudge ”  factors.

 Part IV / Chapter 15
 15.5 
 Conclusion 
 In contrast to other chapters, chapters 14 and 15 have considered how societies 
allocate their scarce resources. If societies ’ health sectors are to maximize the value 
obtained from scarce resources, some method must be found to assess the value of 
technologies. Years ago, when societies relied on professional norms, such as phy-
sicians ’  assessments were based on such factors as practice experience; to deter-
mine whether or not a service was effective, there was a reliance on the individual 
decisions of physicians and other health professionals to do what was best to 
achieve socially optimal outcomes from expenditures on personal health services. 
Insofar as patients pay only a small part of the health care bill in many countries, 
and because it is recognized that physicians should rely on evidence-based medi-
cine, not just on their own experiences in clinical decision making, it is no longer 
appropriate to rely solely on private decisions made in the examining room based 
on the professional experiences of individual practitioners. Instead, methods for 
assessing the productivity and value of specific technologies are needed. 
 That a methodology will be used to make collective decisions about resource 
allocation is not in question. The only issue is how these assessments will be done. 
Clearly, the techniques described in these two chapters represent work in progress. 
Yet in the end, although they are imperfect, it is important to ask, what is the 
alternative? Refinements in techniques are constantly being made, and much prog-
ress has been realized.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 15.1  
 When is it appropriate to use  B  –  C (the difference between benefit and cost) 
as a criterion for project adoption? When is it appropriate to use  B / C (the 
ratio of benefit to cost)?  
 15.2  
 Suppose you are asked to evaluate the desirability of public investment in 
a vaccine to prevent HIV/AIDS. Which benefits and which costs will you 
include? How will you measure the benefits of an HIV/AIDS vaccine? 
 15.3  
 Some object to benefit-cost analysis on the grounds that it favors the wealthy. 
Explain the argument, being sure to discuss why benefit-cost analysis might 
favor the wealthy. 
 15.4  
 What is meant by the value of a statistical life (VSL)? Is a life worth more 
in a high-income country, such as the United States, than in a low-income 
country, such as Haiti? Why or why not? 
 15.5  
 Why do smokers on average have a lower VSL than nonsmokers? 
 15.6  
 What is meant by the  “ revealed preference ” approach to benefit 
valuation? 
 15.7  
 What is meant by the  “ stated preference ” approach to benefit valuation? 
Explain how it has been implemented empirically. Describe the pros and 
cons of this approach. 
 15.8  
 What does it mean that VSL has an income elasticity of about 0.5 – 0.6? Based 
on this finding, what are the implications of using VSL as a measurement 
of benefit in allocating health care resources? 
 15.9  
 The literature review conducted by  Viscusi and Aldy (2003 ) indicates that 
VSL decreases with age. How should this result be interpreted? Based on 
this finding, draw the offer curve (as shown in   fig. 15.2 ) for young and 
elderly individuals. Is your comparison between the young and the elderly 
similar to the comparison between nonsmokers and smokers? 
 15.10   Why do respondents who actually have a disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis) 
have a much higher willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid getting the disease 
than persons who do not have the disease? 
 15.11   Describe the use of benefit-cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis in 
public decision making.

 15.3  Bishai and Lang (2000)  used the stated preference approach to estimate the 
WTP for a one-month reduction in a waiting time for cataract surgery. They found 
that an average cataract patient in Barcelona, Spain, would be willing to pay 
US$107 (in 1992 prices) for a reduction in waiting time of one month. But the same 
WTP estimate for an average cataract patient in Denmark is only US$24. Their 
study also reports that 40 percent of cataract surgeries in Barcelona are performed 
in the private sector to avoid the waiting time in the public sector. By contrast, 
only 15 percent of the cataract surgeries in Denmark are performed in the private

sector. How would you use the information on the ratio of cataract surgeries per-
formed in the private sector across countries to judge the validity of this study? 
 15.4   A recent study found that drugs that offer therapeutic advantages over exist-
ing drugs are associated with a greater number of serious adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs), including those that result in hospitalization and death. Suppose one 
pharmaceutical manufactures develops a genetic test that can substantially reduce 
the probability of ADRs, and this firm hires you as consultant to estimate patients ’ 
WTP for this genetic test. 
 a.  Which approach will you take to estimate the WTP for a reduction in the risk 
of ADRs? Will you use the revealed preference approach or the stated preference 
approach? Justify your answer. 
 b.  Suppose your boss (the pharmaceutical firm) asks you to use the contingent 
valuation method to elicit the WTP for reducing the risk of ADRs. How would 
you design your questionnaire form? Describe your overall strategy. 
 c.  Use a questionnaire from part b or another source to conduct a  “ pre-test ”  by 
interviewing ten persons individually, and analyze your results. Show minimum, 
maximum, and mean value of the WTP. Does the WTP vary with age and 
income? Explain your findings.

 The Contribution of Personal 
Health Services to Longevity, 
Population Health, and Economic 
Growth 
 In many countries, population health and longevity have increased substantially 
over the previous century. By contrast, in others, trends in health indicators are far 
less favorable ( Becker, Philipson, and Soares 2005 ). Improved health may have 
important benefits in improving market and nonmarket (e.g., in such activities as 
parenting) productivity, as well as having value in its own right. This raises an 
important concern about the extent to which the improvement in population health 
can be attributed to the use of personal health care services and to the technologi-
cal change in these services realized over the past century. 
 This chapter addresses this issue by investigating the interaction between the 
health and economic sectors. Resources allocated from the economic sector to 
the health sector are inputs and improvement in population health is the output. 
On the one hand, how the health care system is structured in financing personal 
health care services has important implications for other macroeconomic out-
comes, such as precautionary saving, labor market outcomes, and deadweight 
losses associated with higher rates of taxation, which may in turn discourage entry 
of business enterprises in a country. On the other hand, the health sector ’ s output, 
gain in population health, has several important potential impacts on the overall 
performance of the economic sector, including increased productivity, higher edu-
cational attainment and saving rates, and substantial changes in demographic 
structure. 
 This chapter begins with an overview of the link between health and eco-
nomic sectors. There are many comparisons among countries on various health 
indicators, often contrasting amounts spent on personal health care services per 
capita population with a single health indicator, such as infant mortality or life 

694 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
expectancy at birth. We discuss the shortcomings of such simple comparisons. 
More rigorous studies, also reviewed here, quantify the effects of personal health 
care services in the aggregate and of particular health services on national output 
or health and longevity. Four feedback connections between the economic and 
health sectors are discussed: (1) how various forms of health care financing create 
incentives that affect macroeconomic outcomes, (2) major pathways through which 
health gains boost economic performance, (3) the role of the health sector as a major 
employer in the national economy, and (4) how development of the economic 
sector changes disease patterns in the health sector. 
 16.1  
 The Link between Health and Economic Sectors 
 Overview 
 Economists often depict links between different sectors in terms of (1) the flow of 
funds and (2) the flow of goods and services, for example between the  “ economic 
sector, ”  which includes other goods and services, and the health sector (  fig. 16.1 ). 
From the perspective of funds flow, in the economic sector there are resource 
allocation issues — how much and which kinds of resources to commit to the coun-
try ’ s health sector. These choices in turn affect the amount and sources of funds 
for financing personal health care services.  
 At the individual level, people decide how much and what type of health 
insurance to purchase and how much to spend on such services out of pocket. On 
a national level, policy makers decide on the amounts and types of resources to be 
allocated to the health sector, including the share of and methods of public financ-
ing. In some countries, such as the UK and Denmark, the public sector devotes a 
substantial share of its resources to financing health care (see chapter 13). Public 
financing consequently accounts for more than 80 percent of total health expendi-
tures in these countries. By contrast, in other countries, such as the United States 
and Mexico, the government spends a smaller share on personal health care ser-
vices. In these countries, public financing accounts for less than half of total health 
expenditure (see chapter 11). Although public sectors in high-income countries 
tend to allocate a larger share of resources to personal health care services, there 
is appreciable variation in methods of financing. Some countries rely on general 
tax revenue as the major source of financing health care, while other countries use 
a tax specifically earmarked for health care, such as a payroll tax; examples of the 
latter funding are Medicare in the United States and the statutory sickness funds 
in Germany (see chapter 12). 
 Combining resource allocation decisions at the individual and national levels, 
flows of funds from the economic sector to the health sector can be subdivided 
into four major components: (1) out-of-pocket spending by individuals, (2) private 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth 
 695
health insurance, (3) general tax revenues, and (4) earmarked tax revenues. The 
relative importance of alternative sources of funds varies among countries. Also, 
the source of financing of employed persons affects the incentives of decision 
makers in each sector, and hence the choices they make about resource allocation 
may affect various macroeconomic outcomes, as described below. 
 First, many individuals are at a high risk of impoverishment from high and 
unanticipated health expenditures if the country relies on out-of-pocket spending 
as a major source of health care financing (see chapter 11). As emphasized earlier 
(see chapter 4), individuals face uncertainties about their future health. 
 Second, individuals ’ saving decisions may be affected by the extent to which 
they are protected from catastrophic health expenditures. One motivation for 
saving, identified by John Maynard  Keynes (1936) , is precautionary saving. 
Many people save today to avoid some uncertain situations that may occur in 
the future, including the possibility that they will suffer a major illness and 
consequently incur a large out-of-pocket health expenditure. Being covered by

health insurance, private or public, reduces such expenditure risk, which in turn 
decreases demand for precautionary saving and increases current consumption 
( Chou, Liu, and Hammitt 2003 ). Thus, whether or not health insurance coverage 
is widespread may have a major impact on a country ’ s saving rate, other factors 
being equal. 
 Third, in some countries, health insurance provision is linked to employ-
ment. Since many workers value having health insurance coverage, the provision 
of health insurance should affect job choices and labor supply more generally. Also, 
employment-based health insurance may reduce labor mobility since employers 
differ in the amounts and types of health insurance they offer, as well as in waiting 
periods before new employees can receive full insurance benefits (discussed in 
chapter 10). 
 Fourth, favorable tax treatment of employer-provided health insurance 
reduces the price of employer-provided health insurance relative to wage income 
(discussed in chapters 4 and 10). Not surprisingly, according to the law of demand, 
if the relative price of a good is reduced, more of it will be demanded. Although 
the tax subsidy may be justified as a means of encouraging employment-based 
coverage and hence risk protection, changes in the relative price between wages 
and health insurance premiums introduce a distortion, which leads to an ineffi-
cient outcome in that people tend to purchase more health insurance than they 
would absent the public subsidy. Thus, viewed from the standpoint of society as 
a whole, there is trade-off between the social benefits of risk sharing and the social 
cost of moral hazard when people purchase excessive amounts of health care (see 
chapters 3 and 4). 
 The health sector transforms resources allocated to the health sector into 
personal health care services. Thus, from the vantage point of the flow of goods 
and services, the health sector furnishes goods and services, which, when com-
bined with patient inputs in health production, yield an output in the form of 
improved health (see chapter 2). In the second stage, the higher level of health, at 
both individual and national levels, improves the overall performance of the eco-
nomic sector, measured in terms of higher personal income and other metrics of 
economic well-being. In addition, the health sector is a major employer in all high-
income and to a lesser extent middle- and low-income countries. These employ-
ment opportunities and capital investments in the health sector contribute to 
income growth in the general economic sector. 
 In addition to the feedback connections from the health sector to the eco-
nomic sector, there is an additional set of causal relationships that operates in the 
opposite direction, from the economic sector to the health sector. Both economic 
growth (increases in national output) and business cycles (fluctuations in national 
output) affect disease patterns in the health sector, which in turn affect the alloca-
tion of health care resources for treating diseases. In low-income countries, morbid-
ity and mortality are predominantly connected to infectious diseases. By contrast, 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth 
 697
in high-income countries, most morbidity and mortality are associated with chronic 
diseases. 
 The Relationship between Improved Health and Longevity and 
Economic Growth 
 Two important questions arise from linkages in flows of goods and services between 
health and economic sectors. First, how much of the long-term gains in population 
health can be attributed to the provision of personal health care services and goods, 
such as physicians ’ services, prescription drugs, and medical devices? Second, 
what are the major pathways through which health gains boost economic 
performance? 
 With regard to the first question, early studies based on cross-sectional data 
found that higher health expenditures did not improve health outcomes. For 
example, the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, with a few exceptions, failed to 
find that higher consumption of health services leads to improved health (see 
chapter 3). However, that study monitored health changes for a period of only three 
to five years, which may be too short a period over which to detect health gains. 
Additionally, the sample was limited to persons aged 62 and younger, yet many 
chronic diseases appear only after this age. 
 In addition, international comparisons show that variation in health expen-
ditures per capita population or as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP) 
among high-income countries is substantially larger than is variation in measured 
health status on a few widely used indicators, such as life expectancy and infant 
mortality. 1 An important implication of these studies is that spending on personal 
health care services is fairly unproductive in improving health, but such a conclu-
sion is premature for several reasons. 
 First, since there are many dimensions of health, comparisons on only one 
or two indicators can be highly misleading. Second, with some exceptions, such 
as infant mortality, there are important lags between health inputs and health out-
comes, often spanning decades. For example, plaque in one ’ s arteries accumulates 
over decades; sports injuries in one ’ s youth may lead to subsequent pain and dis-
ability of the knee in one ’ s fifties and sixties; and malignant tumors are often years 
in the making. Thus, the health effects of a healthy diet, treatment by a sports injury 
physician, or having regular mammograms may not yield important health benefits 
for decades. Third, other factors than purchased health inputs affect health out-
comes; if the analyst does not account for these other factors (e.g., health behaviors 
and environmental factors), estimates of the effect of health sector spending on 
health are likely to be biased, perhaps overstated if, for example, people who visit 
a physician regularly also engage in healthy behaviors. 
 By contrast, several recent studies based on long aggregate time-series or 
longitudinal data on individuals reach the opposite conclusion, namely, that allo-
cating more resources to personal health care services is highly productive in terms 
1.  We leave it to the 
interested reader to 
find such studies. They 
are numerous in 
popular discussions of 
health policy.

of improved health outcomes. The difference in findings is not at all surprising. 
Over time, one can observe the effects of technological change. At a single point 
in time or even over a period of three to five years, technology is fixed. 
 Bloom and Canning (2000)  decomposed the relationship between improved 
health and income growth into (1) productivity gains, (2) higher educational attain-
ment, (3) increased saving rates (not because of the precautionary motive but 
because people expect to live longer), and (4) a demographic dividend. By  demo-
graphic dividend , the authors referred to the effects of improved health on the 
demographic structure of the population, which in turn leads to higher rates of 
economic growth. 
 Health, like education, is a form of human capital that potentially affects one ’ s 
productivity in both market and nonmarket work. Healthier individuals tend to 
devote more hours to market work and tend to be more productive per work hour. 
In addition, healthier youth not only are likely to remain in school but learn more 
while there. Several studies have emphasized that accumulation of knowledge 
capital is a major engine of economic growth (see in particular  Romer 1990 ;  Warsh 
2006 ). 
 An important model in economics is the life-cycle model of consumption 
( Modigliani and Brumberg 1954 ). According to the life-cycle model, people accu-
mulate wealth during their early years and spend their wealth in their later years. 
To the extent that longevity is increased, people are led to save more in their early 
years. 
 In low-income countries, the increase in life expectancy mainly comes from 
reduced infant (deaths in the first year of life) and child mortality (deaths between 
years one and six) rates. Mortality declines among infants and children induce 
subsequent declines in fertility rates (see, e.g.,  Soares 2005 ). The demographic 
structure changes substantially when a country moves from a state of high mortality 
and fertility rates to one of low mortality and fertility rates. This demographic 
change increases the proportion of the working-age population, thus increasing the 
labor supply, which in turn increases the national product. Also, lower mortality 
and lower fertility increase parents ’ incentives to invest in their children ’ s human 
capital. Combining these two effects, there is a clear relationship between demo-
graphic change and higher economic growth.

 Effects of Health Care Financing on National 
Economies 
 Savings Behavior 
 Other things being equal, the financial risk of unanticipated medical expenses, 
measured as the ratio of a household ’ s spending on personal health care services 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth

to income, plausibly declines with income. Therefore, high-income individuals 
should be exposed to lower out-of-pocket health expenditure risk following health 
shocks. For this reason, the precautionary saving motive should be stronger for 
low-income households than for the affluent. 
 Given the precautionary motive for saving, which is greater when households 
lack health insurance, one would expect that expanding health insurance, either 
through public provision or the private market, would reduce saving rates, health 
insurance being a substitute for self-insurance accomplished by precautionary 
saving. Using data from Taiwan,  Chou, Liu, and Hammitt (2003)  obtained empirical 
evidence in support of this prediction. 
 Some countries provide health insurance to low-income individuals or house-
holds for persons with incomes and assets below specific thresholds. An example 
of this type of means-tested program is the Medicaid program in the United States 
(discussed in chapter 12). Medicaid in effect imposes a 100 percent tax on income 
and assets above the program ’ s income and asset thresholds. This 100 percent tax 
creates a financial disincentive for households with assets near the threshold to 
accumulate wealth ( Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes 1995 ). 
 Even though providing a safety net is welfare-enhancing in that it reduces 
the expenditure risk of low-income households, which presumably are risk averse, 
at the same time, it may increase wealth inequality among households. We use the 
term  “ may ” since the overall effect on wealth distribution depends on how the 
public program is financed. 
 While having a lower saving rate may have deleterious effects on a country ’ s 
economic growth, precautionary saving is an inefficient method for insuring against 
the risk of a large medical expense because of the lack of risk pooling (see chapter 
10), which both private and public health insurance accomplish. 
 Labor Market Outcomes 
 Efficiencies in marketing and claims processing are realized when health insurance 
is furnished through large employers rather than sold on an individual basis (see 
chapter 10). Yet at the same time, employer-based insurance introduces an ineffi-
ciency in labor markets, namely, job immobility or  “ job lock ” (see also chapter 10). 
Workers may be reluctant to switch jobs out of fear of losing their current health 
insurance or because they may face limitations on insurance coverage at new jobs, 
even though they would be more productive in other jobs. 
 Researchers have implemented two different approaches to empirically inves-
tigate the impact of health insurance on mobility decisions. One approach uses a 
difference-in-differences research design. Using this approach,  Madrian (1994)  
found that the availability of health insurance substantially reduces job mobility, 
by 30 – 67 percent. 
 The second approach uses variation in state laws in the United States that 
require employers to offer health insurance for a specific time after the employee 

700 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
leaves the employer, with the premiums paid by the employer. Such mandates 
would presumably reduce the job-lock effect ( Gruber 2000 ). Based on this approach, 
 Gruber and Madrian (1994)  found that laws requiring employers to continue health 
insurance coverage indeed increased job mobility. More specifically, requiring 
employers to offer coverage for one year following an employee ’ s termination 
boosted job mobility rates by 12 – 15 percent. Summarizing this and other evidence 
on job lock and health insurance,  Gruber (2000)  concluded that employer-based 
health insurance in the United States reduces job mobility substantially, by roughly 
25 – 30 percent. 
 The lack of universal health insurance coverage in the United States also has 
had implications for retirement decisions. Medicare coverage generally becomes 
available only at age 65. The availability of health insurance from sources other 
than Medicare has been an important consideration for persons contemplating 
retiring before this age. Some employers in the United States offer health insurance 
to persons who retire before age 65. There is empirical evidence that the availability 
of such health insurance increases the odds of early retirement by 20 – 50 percent 
( Gruber 2000 ). 
 Another effect of employer-provided health insurance, at least in the United 
States, is that such insurance is generally offered to the employee ’ s entire family. 
This practice reduces the incentive for persons other than the highest earner in the 
family to work. This type of  “ wife lock ” reduces the labor force participation of 
wives by about 11 – 20 percent ( Gruber 2000 ). 
 Another potential impact of employer-provided health insurance is on the 
level of wage compensation. There is empirical evidence that the cost of health 
insurance to employees is fully offset by reductions in wage compensation (see 
chapter 10).  Gruber (1994)  examined whether or not the substantial increase in the 
cost of health insurance arising from laws requiring US employers to provide com-
prehensive health insurance coverage for prenatal care and obstetric delivery 
reduced the earnings of married women. Using a difference-in-difference approach, 
he compared differences in wages between an affected group (women of child-
bearing age) and an unaffected group (such as older workers and single men), in 
states with and without such mandates. Gruber found a statistically significant 
relative decline in the wages of married women between the ages of 20 and 40, 
and the magnitude of wage reduction was almost identical to the increased insur-
ance cost of this insurance mandate to employers. 
 Overall, empirical studies indicate that non-universal employment-based 
health insurance reduces job mobility, discourages early retirement, and reduces 
the labor force participation of female spouses with lower earning potential 
than the male wage earner in the family. In addition, the cost of employer-
provided health insurance appears to be largely offset by reductions in wage 
compensation. 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth 
 701
 These findings have two important implications. First, introducing universal 
health insurance should increase job mobility, thus increasing worker productivity 
by improving matching between workers and jobs. Some empirical support for this 
implication comes from a study of Canadian data. Using monthly data on employ-
ment and wages in eight industries and ten provinces over 1961 – 1975,  Gruber and 
Hanratty (1995)  found that the introduction of universal health insurance in Canada 
raised employment by 2 percent and wages by 3 to 4 percent. 
 Second, there may be a change in employment and work hours. The direction 
of the effect is hard to predict a priori because of the effects of providing universal 
health insurance coverage, which move in opposite directions. In Taiwan, there 
was a substantial reduction in the size of the labor force after an expansion of 
eligibility for health insurance by the government. In 1982, the health plan for 
government employees expanded health insurance coverage to the spouses of gov-
ernment employees. At the time, these spouses were the only nonemployed persons 
who could obtain health insurance. 
 Chou and Staiger (2001)  treated this reform as a natural experiment to inves-
tigate whether or not the availability of health insurance to the nonworking popula-
tion affects the labor force participation (LFP) rate of married women. They 
compared the LFP rate of government employees ’ wives to that of non-government 
employees ’  wives. They found that the availability of health insurance to nonwork-
ers reduced the LFP rate among married women by about four percentage points. 
 Taiwan ’ s implementation of universal health insurance in 1995 provided a 
 “ reverse test ” of the test Chou and Staiger conducted. Given the Chou-Staiger find-
ings, the LFP of non-government employees ’ wives should have been affected by 
the universal health insurance, while government employees ’ wives should have 
been unaffected by this change in insurance coverage. The results were substan-
tively consistent with those obtained for the 1982 reform. 
 Welfare Loss of Taxation 
 While in the political sphere, one hears a lot about the benefits of health insurance 
coverage, health services use scarce resources, and health insurance for such ser-
vices must be financed in some way. Further, despite political promises that only 
others will pay for the extra benefits, not the  “ we who are deserving, ” in the end, 
we all pay. 
 Financing from general tax revenues, and by dedicated revenue sources such 
as a payroll tax, for social health insurance are two common approaches to rais-
ing revenue. In addition, in countries relying on private financing of personal 
health care services, governments may provide tax subsidies to employer-provided 
health insurance. How public funds are obtained potentially affects resource allo-
cation choices people and firms make. Such altered choices in effect represent 
distortions, with associated welfare losses for society. The economic rationale for 

702 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
these distortions is that they account for externalities that, absent these taxes and 
subsidies, would not be accounted for in private decision making. Whether or not 
this is so is an important and complex question. 
 Two sources of general tax revenue are (1) direct taxes, such as personal and 
corporate income taxes, and (2) indirect taxes, such as excise taxes. Direct taxes 
on personal income generate deadweight losses or excess burden mainly through 
the distortion of the labor supply decision. Excise taxes also affect individuals ’ 
consumption choices.  
 Several studies have evaluated the effect of taxation on labor supply by 
treating a tax on personal income as a reduction in the net, after-tax wage (e.g., 
 Hausman 1985 ). Imposing the tax changes the supply of labor (or hours of 
work) through the substitution effect and the income effect (see chapter 5). Through 
the substitution effect, the tax reduces the price (or opportunity cost) of leisure, 
and hence the worker increases his or her demand for leisure and decreases the 
number of work hours by a corresponding amount. Through the income effect, 
the tax reduces net income, and the individual  “ purchases ”  fewer hours of leisure 
as a consequence. In theory, the net effect of these offsetting substitution and 
income effects is indeterminate. If the substitution effect is sufficiently large that 
it offsets the income effect, an increase in the tax rate on personal income causes 
a decrease in labor supply, thus providing a disincentive for people to engage in 
market work. 
 If tax financing comes from indirect taxes, the deadweight losses occur from 
a distortion in the relative prices of goods and services.   Figure 16.2  illustrates the 
conceptual framework for the definition of excess burden of an indirect tax. 
The downward-sloping curve represents the market demand for a good ( D ) and the 
upward-sloping curve represents the market supply of the good ( S ). In a perfectly 
competitive market with zero taxes, the intersection of demand and supply curves 
determines the equilibrium price and quantity at  p 0 and  x 0 , respectively. The 
supply curve shifts upward when an indirect tax ( τ ) is imposed on the good. In 
this case, the new equilibrium price increases to  p 1 +  τ , and the new equilibrium 
quantity decreases to  x 1 .  
 As a result of taxation, the consumers ’ surplus, defined as the maximum 
amount consumers are willing to pay in excess of the amount they actually pay 
( p 0  ×  x 0 ), decreases by the area  A +  B . Similarly, the producers ’ surplus, defined 
as the level of profits received in supplying the quantity sold (represented by 
( p 0  – MC)  ×  x 0 , assuming that marginal cost (MC) coincides with the supply sched-
ule  S ), declines by the area  C +  D . Since the sum of the losses in consumers ’ surplus 
and producers ’ surplus ( A +  B +  C +  D ) exceeds the amount of revenue collected 
( τ  ×  x 1 , represented by the area  A +  C ), there is a deadweight loss in the amount of 
 B +  D ( Auerbach 1985 ). An empirical estimate of the marginal deadweight loss is 
that a $1 increase in taxes leads to a deadweight loss ranging from $1.07 to $1.33 
( Summers 1989 ). 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth 
 703
 Most countries collect revenues for social health insurance from a payroll tax; 
there are mandatory contributions based on employees ’ wages, with the employer 
and employee sharing the cost. In addition to the excess burden of such taxes, 
payroll financing has a number of potential impacts on the performance of a coun-
try ’ s economy, such as on the employment level and economic growth. The impact 
of payroll tax on economic activity depends on tax incidence — on who bears the 
taxes. 
 Conceptually, consumers, employers, and employees can bear the burden of 
payroll taxes. Employers may shift the cost of payroll taxes to consumers in the 
form of higher product prices (forward shifting). When forward shifting occurs, 
using payroll taxes to finance health care would potentially lower the country ’ s 
competitiveness globally, thereby reducing the economy ’ s growth rate. If employers 
bear the burden of a payroll tax, then a payroll increases the cost of hiring labor, 
which in turn reduces employment and increases the country ’ s unemployment 
rate. Alternatively, employers may pass the cost of payroll taxes on to workers in 
the form of lower wages (backward shifting). 
 The ambiguity in theoretical predictions suggests that empirically investigat-
ing the incidence of payroll taxation is critical for assessing the efficiency implica-
tions of financing personal health care services through a payroll tax. Most of the 
empirical evidence on the incidence of payroll taxation shows that the major part 
of the burden of such cost is typically shifted onto workers; that is, employees bear

the full costs of payroll taxation in the form of reduced wage compensation ( Gruber 
1994 ,  1997 ), which is analogous to the effect of employer-provided health insur-
ance coverage on employees ’ wages in countries with a private employer-based 
health insurance. An added important implication of this finding is that payroll 
taxes per se have minor impacts on employment levels ( Nickell 1997 ). 
 The tax subsidy from the favorable treatment of employer-provided health 
insurance in the United States substantially reduces government revenues and 
reduces the net price of such insurance by about 30 percent ( Gruber and Poterba 
1996 ). The reduction in the price of employer-provided health insurance in turn 
distorts the employee ’ s decision to purchase such insurance, as well as the generos-
ity of such insurance coverage. In the end, this distortion generates deadweight 
losses since the loss of government tax revenues arising from the tax subsidy 
exceeds the gains in consumers ’ and producers ’ surpluses.

 Secular Trends in Determinants of Health 
Inputs and Outputs 
 Secular Trends in Expenditures on Personal Health Care 
Services 
 A major justification for public intervention is that something in addition to the 
better health of persons directly advantaged by the public program is involved. In 
part, the something is the externalities from reductions in infectious disease rates, 
as well as consumption externalities (see chapter 1). But it is becoming increasingly 
apparent that a healthy population also yields dividends in terms of improved 
performance of a country ’ s economy. 
 Health expenditures measure a country ’ s final consumption of health care 
goods and services plus capital investments in health care infrastructure.   Table 
16.1 provides a summary of personal health care expenditures as a percentage of 
GDP in thirty OECD countries for the period 1970 – 2005.  
 This international comparison of health expenditures reveals two stylized 
facts. First, at a single point in time, or cross-sectionally, there is substantial varia-
tion in health expenditure among OECD countries, not only in terms of the health 
expenditure but also as a share of GDP allocated to personal health care services. 
For example, in the year 2005, the share of GDP spent on health care ranged from 
5.7 percent in Turkey to 15.2 percent in the United States. Second, over time, all 
countries, irrespective of whether their health expenditure levels were initially 
high or low, have experienced a very similar trend in the growth of health care 
spending. The growth rate of health expenditures has consistently exceeded the 
growth rate of GDP. For example, in Australia, the share of GDP spent on health 
care increased from 4.6 percent in 1970 to 8.8 percent in 2005, an increase of 4.2

percentage points during a thirty-five-year period. Similarly, in the United States, 
this share increased from 7.0 percent in 1970 to 15.2 percent in 2005, an increase 
of 8.2 percentage points. Among the twenty-two OECD countries with complete 
data on health expenditures for 1970 – 2005, in twenty-one countries the share of 
GDP devoted to personal health care services rose by more than two percentage 
points. 
 Determinants of Personal Health Care Expenditures 
 These stylized facts have provided an impetus for research on the causes of these 
increases. Empirical studies have yielded consistent findings on the determinants 
of personal health care expenditures. National income (such as GDP per capita) is 
the most important single determinant of cross-sectional variation in health care 
expenditures, with an associated income elasticity of about one; a 10 percent 
increase in national income leads to an increase in health expenditures of about 
10 percent, holding other factors constant ( Gerdtham and J ö nsson 2000 ). 
 Other factors affect health expenditures as well, including institutional 
arrangements. For example, compared to countries in which consumers have free 
choice of providers, countries using primary care physicians as gatekeepers for 
inpatient care consistently have lower health expenditures. Also, countries in 
which physicians are paid on a capitated basis tend to have lower health care 
expenditures ( Gerdtham and J ö nsson 2000 ). 
 While differences in income alone can explain most of the cross-sectional 
variation in health expenditures, growth in income cannot explain why health 
expenditures have risen so substantially over time. Such other factors as population 
aging, the increased coverage of health insurance, growth in the number of health 
professionals and hospital capacity, and lower productivity growth in the service 
sector than in other sectors of countries ’ economies may partly explain health care 
expenditure growth. 
 However,  Newhouse (1992)  argued that the above-mentioned factors taken 
together account for less than half of the long-run growth in health care expendi-
tures. Instead, Newhouse proposed that the major part of the increase in health 
expenditures stems from technological change in health care. Included in techno-
logical change are newly developed types of equipment, pharmaceuticals, and 
medical devices, as well as new surgical technologies and the development and 
diffusion of such technological tools as renal dialysis. 
 This view is widely accepted by health economists. In a survey of US health 
economists, 81 percent of respondents agreed with the statement that the primary 
reason for the increase in the health sector ’ s share of GDP is technological change 
in medicine ( Fuchs 1996 ), a view supported by other empirical evidence ( Okunade 
and Murthy 2002 ). 
 Hall and Jones (2007 ) developed a conceptual framework for explaining why 
health expenditures are commanding a rising share of national income in many 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth

high-income countries. In their framework, as people become more affluent and 
the consumption of goods and services other than personal health care services 
rises, the marginal utility per dollar of non-health-care consumption declines. It 
is, after all, possible to drive only one car or to take one vacation at a time. Even 
if, as economists assume, consumers do not reach the point of satiation, even 
increasing the quality of the car and the vacation has its limits and can yield only 
so much extra satisfaction. But health care spending extends longevity and improves 
quality of life per year of life, thus adding years during which a person can 
consume. In contrast to other consumption goods, the marginal utility of life exten-
sion does not fall as longevity increases, at least as long as health status is main-
tained. Because the marginal utility of non-health-care consumption declines but 
the utility of spending on health care does not, nations spend an increasing share 
of their income on health care as their national incomes rise. 
 The authors predicted that by the mid-twenty-first century, spending on 
health care will be 30 percent of GDP in the United States, more than double the 
percentage in the year 2000. This growth in share is approximately what one would 
calculate from simple extrapolation of the differential in growth in national income 
and in national health care spending during 1970 – 2000. Hall and Jones argued on 
the basis of empirical evidence from one published and one unpublished study 
that the value of life increases twice as fast as income, a result consistent with the 
growing secular trend in personal spending on health care services as a share of 
GNP in the United States and other high-income countries. 
 This line of argument raises more questions than it answers. First, it is not 
clear how much of the improvement in longevity is really traceable to health care. 
Second, it is not clear that the current absolute level of US spending or the pro-
jected level of spending is optimal. The United States spends twice as much per 
capita as the other ten richest countries, but it has a slightly shorter average longev-
ity than other affluent countries have (see   tables 16.1 and 16.2 ). Should one infer 
that other countries spend too little or that the United States spends too much? 
More to the point, one should conclude that correlations do not establish optimality 
with respect to consumption of a good, the cost of which is drastically reduced by 
insurance at the time of use. 
 Of course, the astute reader will remind us about our warning earlier in this 
chapter that comparisons of spending and health are subject to omitted variables 
bias. Factors other than personal health care services affect health and longevity. 
These other factors may be positively correlated with trends in the use of personal 
health care services. To not explicitly incorporate these other factors in analysis of 
trends in health outcomes will almost certainly lead to an overestimate of the 
effectiveness of personal health care services in contributing to the health improve-
ments that have occurred. On the other hand, the differences are so large that the 
other factors would have to have substantial explanatory power for the gaps to be 
closed.

 Secular Trends in Health Outcomes 
 Table 16.2 summarizes data on life expectancy at birth for the total population of 
thirty OECD countries for 1960 – 2005. Again, there are two stylized facts. First, at 
a single point in time, there are substantial differences in life expectancy among 
countries. For example, in 1960, life expectancy at birth ranged from 48.3 years in 
Turkey to 73.8 years in Norway — a longevity differential between these two coun-
tries of 25.5 years. Although differences among countries in longevity declined 
over time, international differences in life expectancy remained in 2005. In that 
year, the life expectancy at birth ranged from 71.4 years in Turkey to 82 years in 
Japan, a gap of 10.6 years. 
 Second, there is a secular trend toward increased life expectancy in all OECD 
countries. The longevity gains between 1960 and 2005 ranged from 3.4 years in the 
Slovak Republic to 26.1 years in South Korea. Countries with a lower life expec-
tancy in 1960 tended to experience greater subsequent improvements in life expec-
tancy. Except for the Slovak Republic, longevity gains between 1960 and 2005 were 
more than 4.5 years — a growth in life expectancy at birth of at least one year per 
decade in high-income countries. 
 In addition, there is another stylized fact concerning life expectancy within 
countries. There are substantial differences in life expectancy among population 
subgroups, such as race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status groups, within coun-
tries. For example, in England and Wales in 1997 – 2001, male manual workers had 
a life expectancy that was 8.4 years less than that of white-collar workers. Similarly, 
in 2002, blacks in the United States could expect to live 5.4 years fewer years than 
whites in that country ( Cutler, Deaton, and Lleras-Muney 2006 ). 
 Determinants of Mortality 
 Compared to health care expenditures, the determinants of mortality and life 
expectancy are more complex. The determinants of mortality may depend on the 
stage of economic development. Also, a general theory of mortality should explain 
all of the above-mentioned stylized facts: cross-sectional differences in life expec-
tancy across countries and across groups within countries, as well as the rise in 
life expectancy over time. This section provides a brief review of the explanations 
of the stylized facts as they pertain to life expectancy. 
 Between 1840 and 2000, the longevity gains in countries with the highest 
longevity documents were nearly 40 years ( Oeppen and Vaupel 2002 ; also see 
chapter 1). About three-quarters of these longevity gains occurred before 1950, with 
the remaining quarter occurring since then. 
 Cutler, Deaton, and Lleras-Muney (2006 ) attributed the longevity gains over 
this long time period to three factors, improvements in nutrition and economic 
growth, in public health, and in vaccinations and medical treatment. The factors 
were relatively important in different periods. Before the mid-nineteenth century, 
improved nutrition and economic growth were the most important contributors to 

710 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
mortality reductions. However, during the late nineteenth century, improvements 
in public health accounted for a greater share of longevity gains. After the 1930s, 
beginning with the introduction of vaccines and antibiotics, as well as the develop-
ment of expensive and intensive treatments, technological change in medicine 
became the dominant factor in accounting for longevity gains. 
 Although the availability of medical technology is an important factor in 
explaining the longevity gains realized in the most recent decades, it is not a key 
factor accounting for the substantial differences in life expectancy among countries 
and among groups within countries. By contrast, educational attainment, social 
factors, and health-related behavior play more important roles than personal health 
care services in accounting for cross-sectional differences in life expectancy. 
 After examining various factors accounting for longevity gains over time and 
cross-sectional differences in life expectancy,  Cutler, Deaton, and Lleras-Muney 
(2006 ) concluded that the determinants of mortality may be summed up in three 
words: knowledge, science, and technology. They emphasized that the application 
of new knowledge arising from advances in the science and technology of health 
is key to reducing mortality. To buttress their argument, they point out that knowl-
edge of the germ theory of disease and knowledge of the health effects of smoking 
have had profound effects on public health policies by, among other things, stimu-
lating the enactment of laws to limit smoking and the levying of higher excise taxes 
on cigarettes, and through effects on on personal behavior. In addition, recent 
advances in medical technologies, such as new treatment procedures and new 
pharmaceuticals, have had substantial effects on health. 
 Having summarized the qualitative evidence on the determinants of health 
and longevity gains, we now turn to quantitative assessments of the effects of the 
use of personal health services on population health. 
 16.4 
 Contributions of Personal Health Care 
Services to Improved Population Health 
 Conceptual Framework 
 The relationship between health inputs and outcomes may be described by a health 
production function (see chapter 2). While a production function expresses the 
relationship between the employment of several inputs and an output, when we 
measure the marginal product of an input, other input levels are held constant. 
 Figure 16.3  describes the relationship between health inputs and output. At a 
point in time, input level  M 0 yields health output at  H 0 at point  A . The input ’ s 
marginal product at point  A is the slope of the total output curve at this point. 
Holding other input levels constant, as the health input increases, its marginal 
product declines.  

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth 
 711
 However, the lower curve in   figure 16.3  is for a constant health technology. 
Over time, technological change in health care occurs, resulting in an upward shift 
in the total output curve and corresponding changes in the marginal product of 
health inputs. For example, at point  C , the marginal product of health care exceeds 
its marginal product at point  B , which applies to technology of an older vintage. 
Each output curve exhibits diminishing returns on the use of health care inputs. 
The way around diminishing returns is either to increase the levels of the other 
inputs or to have technological change, which potentially boosts the marginal 
product of all health inputs, perhaps to differing degrees. 
 Thus, at any given point in time, the causal relationship between a change 
in health care expenditures and a change in health outcomes is a movement along 
a given health production function (e.g., from point  A to point  B in   fig. 16.3 ). As 
 Fuchs (1996)  explained, at any given point in time, the health production function, 
especially in high-income countries, may be near the flat curve part of the total 
output curve (e.g., near point  B ). This implies, in a static context, that a large 
increase in personal health expenditures would not produce a major overall 
improvement in overall health. 
 Economists describe technological progress as the implementation of new 
knowledge leading to higher output per unit of input. Often a distinction is made 
between  process and  product innovations. With a process innovation, the charac-
teristics of the output are unchanged, but the output is produced with the use of

fewer resources. An example is the introduction of the cotton gin, which allowed 
seeds to be removed from cotton by machine, which was much more efficient than 
removing the seeds by hand. 
 A product innovation involves the introduction of a new product, such as 
the personal computer. There are many product innovations in health care, such 
as new drugs and new surgical procedures, and new ways to image the body. 
However, as the concept of technological change is being used here, the output is 
improved health and the health inputs are types of labor and capital. In this 
context, the distinction between process and product innovation is unimportant. 
If, for example, a new imaging machine enables a diagnosis to be made more 
accurately and quickly, fewer resources are required to produce a given health 
outcome. Patients spend fewer days in the hospital than previously or perhaps may 
avoid the hospital entirely. In sum, the distinction between the static context 
(movements along a given health production function) and the dynamic context (a 
shift in the health production function) provides a useful framework for examining 
the causal relationship between health care and health outcomes. Whether health 
care has contributed to improved health and longevity in any important way 
depends in large part on the extent of technological change in medicine that has 
occurred. We use this conceptual framework to synthesize the empirical studies 
reviewed below. 
 Empirical Evidence from Cross-Sectional Studies 
 To our knowledge, the study by  Auster, Leveson, and Sarachek (1969)  is the earliest 
published study to employ regression analysis to examine the relationship of mor-
tality to both health care and environmental variables, such as income and educa-
tion. Based on an analysis of data on US states in 1960, the authors found that 
health care makes a positive contribution to improved health, but the effect was 
not statistically significant, and the magnitude of marginal impact was quite 
small — a 1 percent increase in health expenditure was associated with a reduction 
in mortality of about 0.1 percent.  “ Environmental variables, ” such as educational 
attainment and income, had more important influences on health than health care 
inputs did. 
 The RAND Health Insurance Experiment investigated the impact of cost 
sharing on both the use of services and health outcomes (see chapter 3). Although 
reduced cost sharing led to increased spending on personal health care services, 
with a few exceptions, reduced cost sharing did not lead to improvements in 
health. Free care did improve blood pressure control and vision for some popula-
tion subgroups ( Brook, Ware, Rogers, et al. 1983 ). These findings are consistent 
with the argument that the production of health in high-income countries is near 
a flat part of the curve, and hence the variation in health care utilization across 
individuals did not lead to a significant difference in health outcomes. 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth 
 713
 These empirical findings are consistent with the statistical relationship 
between health expenditure and life expectancy at birth seen among high-income 
countries.   Figure 16.4  shows the relationship between health expenditures (hori-
zontal axis) and life expectancy at birth (vertical axis) for high-income countries, 
defined as countries with income levels above the 50th percentile of world income 
distribution among 175 countries, in 2000. Meanwhile,   figure 16.5  shows the same 
relationship for low-income countries, those with income levels under the 50th 
percentile of the world income distribution, in 2000.

 These two figures reveal a very different pattern in the shape of health pro-
duction function. For high-income countries, the shape of the health production 
function is near the flat part of the curve, indicating that an increase in expendi-
tures on personal health care services does not lead to much change in population 
health as measured by life expectancy at birth. By contrast, the shape of the health 
production function is upward sloping for low-income countries, indicating that 
an increase in such expenditures leads to substantial improvements in health out-
comes. These cross-sectional comparisons suggest there is a diminishing marginal 
return to health care inputs where medical technology is fixed and health inputs 
are employed at high levels.

 Overview of Analytic Approaches 
 A technical problem in attributing gains in health and longevity to technological 
change is that although individual technological changes are observable, there is 
no aggregate measure that adequately captures this phenomenon. In addition, over 
a long time period, improvement in health outcomes also depends on various other 
factors, such as economic growth, public health, better access to personal health 
care services, and better public information about the new medical knowledge and 
behavioral changes, in addition to new medical knowledge and its implementation. 
Hence, quantifying the influence of technological change on health and longevity 
is a challenging task. Researchers have approached this challenge in several ways. 
 Some researchers have used data at the level of the individual to quantify the 
relationship between technological change and health outcomes, focusing on a 
specific disease or therapeutic procedure. Using data on individual patients with 
a single disease has the advantage of allowing investigators to control for other 
factors, including other diseases (comorbidities), demographic characteristics, and 
characteristics of the disease the person has that may also influence health out-
comes, which is more difficult in a study using aggregate data. For example, as 
practitioners gain proficiency with a specific new procedure, they may accept 
patients at higher risk for an adverse outcome for treatment. To the extent that this 
is so, and lacking adequate controls, researchers may understate the contribution 
of the technological change to population health. 
 Other researchers have attempted to find a proxy variable to capture the effect 
of technological change, such as using the increase in personal health expenditures 
over time or the cumulative number of new drugs available in the market (  box 
16.1 ). However, there is a risk that other important factors systematically related 
to technological change are excluded from the analysis, which can lead to biased 
estimates of the effects of technological change.  
 A third approach has used an accounting method to calculate the contribution 
of technological change to better health outcomes. This approach uses available 
evidence from clinical studies, where individual patients are the observational 
unit, to identify all factors that potentially contribute to improved health outcomes. 
Based on this information, researchers have constructed estimates for a country as 
a whole of the proximate effect of technology change on better health. 
 The Disease Approach 
 Treatment for a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction, AMI) is the best-known 
example of employing the disease approach to quantify marginal benefits of tech-
nological change. Using a sample of Medicare beneficiaries,  Cutler and McClellan 
(2001)  presented evidence that the life expectancy for the average person experi-
encing a heart attack in the United States increased by about one year between 
1984 and 1998. Based on their empirical analysis, they concluded that about 70 
percent of this longevity gain resulted from technological change in heart attack

 How to Measure Technological Change in Medicine 
 Technological change in medicine has been a major cause of rising health expendi-
tures in many countries. Meanwhile, there is a growing body of empirical evidence 
indicating that technological change in medicine has made a substantial contribution 
to increased longevity and an improved quality of life. A common issue in these 
empirical studies is how to measure technological change in medicine empirically. 
 Some studies focus on technological change in medicine in general, while others 
focus pharmaceutical innovation in particular. The former literature typically uses 
total R & D spending in the whole economy or R & D spending specific to health care 
as proxies for technological change (e.g.,  Okunade and Murthy 2002 ). 
 In addition, there is international medical technology diffusion. The rest of world 
may benefit from medical technological change occurring in countries at the frontier 
of medical technology. Thus, the diffusion of technological change in medicine can 
be measured by medical imports and by diffusion in the forms of ideas, such as the 
number of foreign-trained medical students ( Papageorgiou, Savvides, and Zachariadis 
2007 ). 
 Studies of pharmaceutical innovation rely on three different types of proxies to 
measure technological change: (1) the cumulative number of drugs approved with 
new molecular entities, (2) newer drugs as a proportion of total prescriptions, (3) and 
the average vintage of drugs. For example,  Lichtenberg (2005) used the first approach. 
He emphasized that approval of new molecular entities represents the most important 
form of innovation. Using the cumulative number of new molecular entities available 
in the market by year, Lichtenberg found a significantly positive relationship between 
his measure of pharmaceutical innovation and life expectancy in the United States 
and in a sample containing data from fifty-two countries. 
 A second approach used by  Lichtenberg (2003)  measured innovation in pharma-
ceuticals by both the development  and  diffusion of new drugs. This approach implic-
itly assumes that the rate of market penetration of new drugs is an appropriate 
measure of the rate of technological change. He reported that diseases with relatively 
high rates of technological change in drug therapy experienced relatively greater 
reductions in disease-specific mortality. He estimated that increases in the market 
share of new drugs explained more than 45 percent of the variation among diseases 
in mortality reduction during 1971 – 1990 in the United States. 
 A third approach, used by  Lichtenberg and Virabhak (2002),  measured the vintage 
of the drugs by the year in which the US Food and Drug Administration first approved 
the drug ’ s active ingredients. This approach implicitly assumes that newer vintage 
drugs represent technological improvements in medical care. Using data from the US 
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in 1997, Lichtenberg and Virabhak found that 
patients who used newer vintage drugs had a higher probability of survival, better 
self-evaluated health status, and fewer limitations in physical function.

care. During the same period, mean expenditures per heart attack increased by 
about $10,000 (1993 US$), of which about half reflected technological change. 
Comparing costs and benefits, they concluded that the benefit exceed the cost 
growth of treating AMI in a ratio of 14 to 1, if the health benefit of an additional 
year of life is valued at $100,000. 
 Substantial health benefits attributable to technological change also apply to 
several other conditions. For example,  Cutler and Meara (2000)  found that techno-
logical change in treating low-birth-weight infants increased the life expectancy of 
such infants by about 12 years. By contrast, innovations in the therapeutic treat-
ment of breast cancer have increased life expectancy by only about four months 
( Cutler and McClellan 2001 ;  Luce, Mauskopf, Sloan, et al. 2006 ). 
 The heterogeneity of health benefits attributable to technological change 
among diseases can be explained by differences in the ways that technological 
change operates. There are basically two channels through which technological 
change affects treatment and hence health outcomes: treatment substitution and 
treatment expansion ( Cutler and McClellan 2001 ). The  treatment substitution  effect 
describes the substitution of a new for an old technology for treating a person with 
a given health condition. This effect represents a shift in the health production 
function, such as from point  A to point  C in   figure 16.3 , which signifies improve-
ment in health outcomes from the technological change. In the case of the  treatment 
expansion  effect, introducing the new technology increases the number of persons 
who receive treatment for the condition. The treatment expansion effect refers to 
the movement along the new health production function, such as from point  C to 
point  C ′ in   figure 16.3 ; marginal health benefits may decline as the new technology 
is applied to more patients. 
 The overall effect of technological change as captured by empirical analysis 
of the effects of technological change on health encompasses a combination of 
treatment substitution and treatment expansion effects. The health benefits of treat-
ment substitution are significantly positive as long as innovations in medical 
technology are productive. However, the health benefits of treatment expansion are 
not always positive; rather, both the sign and magnitude of the effects depend on 
how valuable the treatment is in the marginal patients. 
 Skinner, Staiger, and Fisher (2006)  provided empirical evidence in support 
of the view that the health benefits of treatment expansion may decrease over time 
as more patients receive the treatment of new technology. Using AMI as an example, 
they noted that the adjusted one-year survival for the US Medicare beneficiaries 
remained almost constant during between 1995 and 2002, although the survival 
rate had increased appreciably between 1984 and 1994. 
 The Proxy Variable Approach 
 Another analytic approach uses observational data to establish the causal relation-
ship between technological change and improvements in health outcomes by 

718 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
multivariate regression analysis. This approach faces two challenges in measuring 
dependent and key independent variables. First, better health outcomes are mul-
tidimensional, including at least the following three components: (1) reductions in 
mortality; (2) reductions in disability and morbidity; and (3) improved quality of 
life, such as reduced pain and suffering. Partly reflecting lack of data on other 
outcomes, most studies have focused on better health outcomes from reduced 
mortality. 
 Second, researchers need to search for a proxy for technological change to 
assess how much medical technology has contributed to better health. Some ana-
lysts use the change in personal health expenditures or pharmaceutical expendi-
tures to capture the effect of technological change. These studies have empirically 
estimated the relationship between health expenditures and health outcomes using 
variation among countries (or states or provinces within a country) and over time 
within individual countries (or states or provinces). This group of studies generally 
found that higher health expenditures in general and pharmaceutical expenditure 
in particular are associated with better health outcomes, as measured by such 
health indicators as increased life expectancy or lower infant mortality rates. 
 For example, using data on Canadian provinces for 1978 – 1992, a period 
during which there was universal coverage in that country,  Cremieux, Ouellette, 
and Pilon (1999 ) reported that an increase in health expenditures led to a statisti-
cally significant effect on the improvement of health outcomes: a 10 percent change 
in health expenditures led to an change in infant mortality rates of 0.4 – 0.5 percent 
and a change in life expectancy by three to six months. 
 A limitation of this approach is that using change in health expenditures or 
pharmaceutical expenditures as a proxy for technological change may be con-
founded by other changes in expenditures influenced by other factors, among them 
increases in the price, quality, or quantity of personal health care services. To the 
extent that these other factors are not explicitly accounted for, estimates of the 
effects of technological change on health may be misstated. 
 Others studies have investigated the effect of technological change on better 
health outcomes by focusing specifically on the role of pharmaceutical innovation. 
This type of study uses the cumulative number of new molecular entities available 
in the market or the average vintage of drug to measure pharmaceutical innovation 
and empirically estimate their impact on population health. These studies gener-
ally find a significant positive relationship between pharmaceutical innovation and 
life expectancy. For example, in a number of studies, Frank Lichtenberg has 
assessed the health benefits of new drugs ( Lichtenberg 2003 ,  2004 ,  2005 ). He evalu-
ated the effects of a broad range of drugs, including older and newer drugs, and 
found that the introduction of new drugs does have benefits in terms of decreased 
mortality. An econometric issue with observational data is that other factors, such 
as health behaviors, may not be held constant, and parameter estimates may be 
biased as a result (see chapter 3). 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth 
 719
 Most studies investigating the effect of technological change on health out-
comes have used data obtained from high-income, technologically advanced coun-
tries. Whether technological change in medicine occurring in high-income countries 
has a similar impact on health outcomes in the rest of the world is an interesting 
question to explore. 
 Papageorgiou, Savvides, and Zachariadis (2007 ) found that the global diffu-
sion of medical technology is an important contributor to improved population 
health, as measured by life expectancy and mortality rates. They argued that 
medical technology generated in the technologically advanced countries diffuses 
across the world through two major channels: (1) imports of medical goods, such 
as pharmaceutical products and medical equipment; and (2) the direct flow of 
medical knowledge from countries at the technological frontier to other countries. 
 Using cross-sectional data from sixty-three technology-importing countries, 
Papageorgiou and coauthors measured imports of medical goods as the sum of a 
country ’ s medical imports, including all pharmaceuticals, medical, and health-
related products. They measured the flow of medical knowledge by the number of 
foreign-trained medical students and distance-weighted foreign R & D. They found 
that both imports of medical goods and flow of ideas are positively correlated with 
health status in nontechnological frontier countries (i.e., those countries that import 
technology rather than develop it). Specifically, they reported that an increase in 
medical technology diffusion from the bottom 25th to the top 75th percentile of 
countries led to longevity gains of seven to ten years. In addition, they found that 
medical technology diffusion in the form of tangible goods (i.e., medical goods) 
was a more important contributor to improved health status than in the form of 
intangible goods (e.g., transfers of ideas). 
 Although the proxy variable approach is subject to potential bias as a result 
of measurement errors or omitted variables, studies with different empirical meth-
odologies have yielded consistent empirical findings. Taken as a whole, the evi-
dence suggests that the increase in personal health care expenditures in general 
and the adoption of new medical technology in particular, such as the introduction 
of new drugs, have contributed to improved health outcomes, especially with 
regard to longevity. 
 The Accounting Method 
 In addition to econometric analysis, other studies have employed an accounting 
approach to quantify the importance of the role of health care as a determinant of 
the long-run gains in health that have been observed. For example, in the United 
States, life expectancy at birth was 69.9 years in 1960 and 76.9 years in 2000, an 
increase of seven years.  Cutler, Rosen, and Vijan (2006)  estimated that 70 percent 
of the seven-year increase in life expectancy could be attributed to reductions in 
mortality from cardiovascular disease. Reductions in infant mortality accounted 
for another 19 percent of the increase in life expectancy between 1960 and 2000 

720 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
( table 16.3 ). Although causes of mortality reductions from cardiovascular disease 
and infant deaths are multifactorial, some research has concluded that at least half 
of the reductions in these types of mortality have resulted from medical advances 
( Cutler, Rosen, and Vijan 2006 ). Taken together, these two estimates imply that over 
40 percent ((70 + 19)/2) of the longevity gains in the United States is attributable 
to medical advances.

 Contribution of Improved Health to Economic 
Growth 
 Direct Effect on Productivity 
 The notion of that health contributes to an individual ’ s human capital and the 
importance of human capital to productivity in market work have been widely 
recognized for decades (see, e.g., the seminal work of Becker 1965). In short, 
healthier populations are more productive. 
 In recent years, many researchers have attempted to quantify the impact of 
health improvement on labor productivity using aggregate data on countries. For 
example,  Bhargava, Jamison, Lau, et al. (2001)  used data on adult survival rates 
(ASRs) to measure health and estimate the impact of changes in ASR on economic 
growth. The ASR was defined as the probability of surviving to age 60, conditional 
on having reached age 15, or past the age at which children are at elevated risk of 
death, especially at age 60 or younger. In low-income countries, improvements in

mortality are concentrated in the 0 to 6 years age range ( Deaton 2006 ). By contrast, 
in higher-income countries, most deaths occur to persons over age 65. 
 Using data grouped in five-year intervals from ninety-two countries for the 
years 1965 – 1990, Bhargava and coauthors found that improvements in health (as 
measured by the ASR) resulted in higher growth rate in GDP. However, the improve-
ments did not occur consistently. Past a level of GDP, further increases in ASR did 
not have much of an effect on GDP. The effect was much more important for low-
income countries than for other countries. 
 Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla (2004)  constructed data from a panel of countries 
observed every 10 years over 1960 – 1990 to estimate the parameters of a model of 
aggregate economic growth. They used life expectancy as a proxy of health, finding 
that health has a positive and statistically significant effect on economic growth. 
After accounting for the effect of physical and other forms of human capital, the 
parameter estimate on life expectancy indicates that each extra year of life expec-
tancy leads to an increase in output of 4 percent. This result reinforces the findings 
of previous studies that an improvement in health raises the productivity of 
workers. 
 Jamison, Lau, and Wang (2005)  employed a similar approach. While they 
found that improved health is an important determinant of economic growth, other 
factors had a greater influence. More specifically, although better health accounted 
for about 11 percent of the total growth rate, growth in the stock of physical capital 
and educational attainment had still larger effects, 67 percent and 14 percent, 
respectively. 
 Weil (2007)  used available microeconomic estimates to quantitatively assess 
the role that health differences play in accounting for the gap in income between 
rich and poor countries. He found that differences in health, measured by the ASR, 
accounted for about 10 percent of income differences between rich and poor coun-
tries. Eliminating health gaps among countries would reduce the differential by 
about 10 percent. 
 Despite the range of statistical methods and data sources, the studies overall 
provide fairly consistent evidence that improved health boosts labor productivity. 
 Indirect Effects Operating through Fertility, Education, and 
Saving 
 In addition to the direct effects of improved health, there are several indirect chan-
nels through which health can affect national income. The reduction in infant and 
child mortality has reduced fertility rates. Especially in low-income countries, 
children are an important source of income support in old age. Parents know they 
will need to depend on children, and alternative support from social insurance 
programs is not widely available. Thus, if they expect a high proportion of their 
children to die before reaching adulthood, they will overshoot in having more 
children than they would if the probability of a child dying was very low, as it is 

722 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
in high-income countries. In low-income countries, reductions in mortality mainly 
stem from reduced deaths from infectious, respiratory, and digestive diseases, 
which are often causes of mortality in young children, as well as congenital and 
perinatal conditions ( Becker, Philipson, and Soares 2005 ). 
 When children are more likely to reach adulthood, there is an added incen-
tive for parents to invest in their children ’ s education ( Soares 2005 ). Reductions 
in mortality increase the returns from investment in human capital because longer 
life increases the time horizon over which the benefits of investment in human 
capital accrue. Increases in educational attainment in turn lead to higher produc-
tivity in both market and nonmarket work. Both lower fertility and higher invest-
ment in human capital have a positive effect on economic growth. 
 Thomas Malthus is known for his pessimistic prediction that population 
would expand and output per worker would fall until national output per capita 
reached the level at which mere population subsistence was attained ( Malthus 
1798 ). However, he did not consider that higher levels of human capital, achieved 
in part by reductions in mortality, could allow a country to grow and achieve 
income far in excess of the subsistence level. In the Malthusian model, population 
grows until a point is reached at which further population growth cannot be sus-
tained, which is the subsistence level. The alternative just described offers a dia-
metrically opposed prediction. Mortality falls, which leads to increased human 
capital and reduced fertility. This process provides an engine for a country ’ s sus-
tained economic growth. 
 The reduction in fertility rates caused by reduced mortality, especially for 
infants and children, also creates a  “ demographic dividend, ” which promotes 
economic growth ( Bloom and Canning 2000 ). Following a decline in fertility, the 
number of young dependents gradually decreases and the proportion of the work-
ing-age population increases. These trends, in combination with other develop-
ment policies that create increased demand for the working-age population, create 
a favorable environment for economic growth.  Bloom, Canning, and Malaney 
(2000)  provided strong empirical evidence to support this argument. They found 
that demographic changes of the sort just described have contributed in important 
ways to the economic success in East Asian countries. 
 In addition, increased longevity leads to higher saving rates. With a longer 
life span, people accumulate more assets during their working years to finance a 
longer anticipated period of retirement ( Bloom, Canning, and Graham 2003 ). This 
prediction is consistent with evidence from several Asian countries. For example, 
both Taiwan and Thailand have experienced rapid increases in life expectancy 
since the 1960s. The consequent changes in demographic structure led to a boom 
in national savings. 
 Empirical analysis conducted by  Bloom, Canning, and Graham (2003)  indi-
cates that a 10-year increase in life expectancy is associated with a rise in saving 
rates of about 4.5 percentage points. Higher rates of saving permit higher rates of 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth 
 723
investment without producing inflationary pressures. With a larger capital stock 
and one of a more recent vintage, labor becomes more productive ( Bloom and 
Canning 2000 ). 
 Other Indirect Effects 
 Improved health also has potentially important, but less tangible benefits ( Howitt 
2005 ). First, good health, especially during childhood, may lead people to be more 
creative adults, which in turn increases a country ’ s rate of innovation. But increased 
creativity in the arts also yields consumption benefits. Thus, just like healthier 
populations tend to have higher labor productivity, healthy people are also more 
efficient in producing new ideas. Knowledge capital plays an important role in 
generating technological change, which in turn increases productivity for the 
economy as a whole ( Warsh 2006 ). Second, improved child and maternal health 
can improve individuals ’ ability to cope with stress and to adapt to new technology 
as adults. The expected return on investment in R & D is higher when workers are 
more likely to adapt to product and process innovations. Third, countries with 
healthier populations tend to have less income inequality ( Deaton 2003 ). This 
finding implies that an improvement in population health may lead to a decrease 
in income inequality. When the income distribution becomes more equal, lower-
income families are better able to finance the education of their children, in turn 
increasing years of educational attainment, an important form of human capital. 
 Contested Issues 
 Although empirical evidence that improved health raises economic growth is 
strong, as is the theoretical case for this relationship, several issues remain hotly 
debated in the literature. Two of the more important issues are discussed here. 
 First, in this chapter, we have emphasized the causal link from good health 
to high levels of economic activity, but does causation go the other way, from high 
levels of economic activity to better health ( Pritchett and Summers 1996 )? If so, an 
important implication is that several health problems in low-income countries, 
such as high infant and child mortality rates, can be solved as a byproduct of high 
economic growth. 
 There is evidence that runs contrary to this view ( Deaton 2006 ). The rapid 
economic growth in China and India in recent years has not been associated with 
a major improvement in health. In fact, in China, almost all of the improvements 
in health were realized before the economic reform of 1978 that subsequently led 
to a rapid economic growth in that country. For example, the longevity gain (at 
birth) in China between 1960 and 1980 was more than 30 years, from 36.3 to 66.8. 
In contrast, during the period between 1980 and 2005, the longevity gain was five 
years only (World Health Organization 2008). A similar pattern exists in India 
( Deaton 2006 ). A plausible explanation for this finding is that the relationship 
between health (as measured by life expectancy) and income (as measured by per 

724 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
capita GDP) is not positive and linear but positive and concave, indicating dimin-
ishing returns. 
 Consequently, rapid economic growth after attainment of a certain threshold 
income level did not lead to further improvements in health. Another plausible 
explanation is that there are important lags before substantial impacts of economic 
growth on health are realized. 
 In addition, if the lags are not too great, and if causation runs from the level 
of economic activity to improved health, one would expect to observe a significant 
relationship between the  change  in income and the  change  in health (e.g., in the 
country ’ s infant mortality rate). However, no statistically significant relationship 
between these two changes has been observed ( Deaton 2006 ). Rather, a lower  level 
of infant mortality is associated with a higher growth rate of income. 
 Based on this observation,  Deaton (2006)  proposed an alternative interpreta-
tion of the link between health and income. He suggested that there are common 
third factors that are important determinants of both economic growth and health, 
such as education and the ability of the government to deliver public health ser-
vices. This implies that the positive relationship between income and health is not 
causal but rather is just a  correlation . The quality of several social institutions, 
such as regulatory agencies and organizations that deliver personal health care 
services, is correlated with both national income and the health status of the coun-
try ’ s people. 
 Another unresolved issue regarding the relationship between health and 
income pertains to the secular trend in global inequality. More specifically, is varia-
tion in levels of health among countries becoming more or less equal? While there 
has been some increase in life expectancy in low-income countries since the mid-
twentieth century, higher-income countries have experienced improvements in 
longevity as well. If there were a single metric of health, the comparisons would 
be easy; however, health is multidimensional, making intertemporal and intercoun-
try comparisons difficult to make. 
 Becker, Philipson, and Soares (2005 ) obtained a common metric, converting 
health gains into money. Often, measures such as GDP are taken as measures of 
the overall well-being of a country ’ s population. However, a country ’ s GDP does 
not include a value for the longevity of its population. Becker and coauthors quan-
tified the value of the longevity gains in dollar terms and added this to the change 
in GDP to obtain a more comprehensive measure of social well-being. 
 Based on a data for ninety-six countries for 1960 – 2000 and using the com-
prehensive measure, Becker and coauthors found that low-income countries (the 
poorest 50 percent of countries in 1960) tended to grow faster than the higher-
income countries (the most affluent 50 percent of countries in 1960). Specifically, 
the mean annual growth rate was 4.1 percent for the low-income countries, of 
which 1.7 percentage points could be attributed to longevity gains. By contrast, the 
mean annual growth rate for the more affluent countries was 2.6 percent, of which 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth 
 725
only 0.4 percentage points reflected longevity gains. Viewed another way, the gain 
in longevity accounted for about 40 percent (1.7/4.1) of the growth in low-income 
countries but for only 15 percent (0.4/2.6) of growth in the other countries. 
 An important implication is that once longevity gains are considered, the 
growth rate in low-income countries has been relatively high. This result is not 
obtained from standard GDP accounts, which exclude the value of health gains. 
 However, this important finding is not universally accepted.  Deaton (2006)  
argued that health inequality across countries is not necessarily narrowing even 
with substantial improvements in life expectancy in low-income countries. Specifi-
cally, he emphasized that mortality patterns differ between rich and poor countries. 
In low-income countries, most deaths involve children, and hence the reduction 
in mortality mainly reflects reductions in infant and child mortality rates. By con-
trast, in high-income countries, most deaths are among persons over age 50. Thus, 
Deaton argued, life expectancy is not necessarily a good indicator for comparing 
changes in health among countries, especially between high- and low-income 
countries. 
 16.6 
 The Health Sector as a Job Machine 
 Most countries in the world spend about 5 – 10 percent of their GDP on health care. 
Thus, the health sector accounts for a substantial share of employment in the 
national economy. As in other industries, the major inputs of the health care indus-
try are labor and capital. Earnings from labor and returns on capital investment are 
the major components of GDP. In this sense, the growth of the health care industry 
makes an important direct contribution to national economic growth, as measured 
by the growth in GDP. 
 The health sector acts as a  “ job machine ” (a major source of employment) 
through the following two channels. First, an increase in the demand for personal 
health care services increases demand for health professionals, including nurses, 
physicians, physicians ’ assistants, and dentists. The demand for labor in the health 
sector is a derived demand arising from the demand for personal health care ser-
vices. Moreover, health is a labor-intensive industry relative to other industries, 
such as electronics and even agriculture in high-income countries. As a result, the 
use of capital as a substitute for labor is less likely to occur in the health sector 
than in other high-tech industries. This suggests that the increase in demand for 
health care has a greater impact on demand for labor than on demand for capital 
in the health sector. As discussed elsewhere in this book, various factors, including 
expansion of insurance coverage, income growth, and population aging, have con-
tributed to an increase in demand for personal health care services, which in turn 
has increased employment in national economies as the suppliers of such services

(and goods, e.g., pharmaceuticals and medical devices) have responded to changes 
in demand for health care products. 
 Second, governments globally often seek to promote economic growth by 
developing new industries that have the potential of increasing national employ-
ment and developing new technology. As the growth of life expectancy globally 
increases demand for personal health care services, two new health sector indus-
tries have emerged and matured: the biopharmaceutical industry and the long-term 
care industry. 
 For example, facing wage competition in the manufacturing sector from less 
well-developed countries, many newly industrialized countries, such as South 
Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, seeking to promote economic growth, are encourag-
ing growth of the biopharmaceutical industry as a means toward this end. Major 
technological advances such as those occurring in genomics have made this path 
to economic growth even more attractive ( Sloan and Eesley 2007 ). Similarly, the 
global trend in population aging has created the increased demand for long-term 
care provided by the formal sector, which in turn has led to the growth of long-term 
care industries in many countries ( Norton 2000 ). These two new industries, in 
combination with the existing industries in health sector (e.g., the hospital indus-
try), enhance the capability of the health sector to promote employment and 
income growth for the whole economy. 
 16.7 
 Economic Growth and Disease Patterns 
 Throughout this chapter, we have focused on the contribution of personal health 
care services to improved population health and the feedback connections from 
the health sector to the economic sector. Here we focus on a reverse feedback con-
nection, from the economic to the health sector. Economic growth may fundamen-
tally affect the health sector in terms of changed disease patterns. 
 As mentioned above, several studies have documented a link between eco-
nomic development and morbidity and mortality patterns. For example, between 
1965 and 1995, about two-thirds of longevity gains in Middle Eastern and North 
African countries came from reductions in deaths caused by respiratory and diges-
tive diseases. By contrast, over half of the longevity gains in North America have 
come from reductions in mortality caused by diseases of the nervous system and 
sense organs and cardiac and circulatory conditions ( Becker, Philipson, and Soares 
2005 ). 
 In addition to economic growth per se, the business cycle (economic sector) 
affects morbidity and mortality patterns.  Ruhm (2000)  provides an interesting test, 
the results of which lend support for a relationship between the business cycle and 
health. Based on US longitudinal data for the 1972 – 1991 period, Ruhm found 

The Contribution of Personal Health Services to Longevity, Population Health, and Economic Growth

strong evidence that unemployment rates in US states are negatively and signifi-
cantly associated with total mortality rates and eight of ten specific causes of fatali-
ties. Hence, health  improved when the output of the economy temporarily fell, as 
reflected in rising state unemployment rates. An important exception is the suicide 
rate. Suicide rates rose during recessions. 
 An important result from this study is reproduced in   figure 16.6 , which shows 
the relationship between national total mortality and unemployment rates over 
time. There is a strong inverse relationship between level of economic activity and 
mortality. In particular, as seen in   figure 16.6 , there was a substantial reduction in 
mortality during two major recessions, both of which were attributable to an oil 
crisis, 1975 and 1982 – 1983. During those periods, unemployment rates reached 
record highs in the United States for the period after the World War II but less than 
the United States has experienced recently (the effects of which cannot yet be 
reflected in a figure).  
 Ruhm (2000)  provides several plausible mechanisms to explain why reces-
sions are good for your health. First, time is the major input in the production of 
good health (see chapter 2). Thus, the time prices of several health-augmenting 
activities, including making physician office visits and engaging in vigorous 
activity, rise during economic upturns. This mechanism is supported by other

empirical findings obtained in this study that smoking and obesity increase, physi-
cal activity is reduced, and diet becomes less healthy during periods of relative 
prosperity. 
 Second, work-related accidents may increase during economic upturns. For 
example, when home construction activity is at a relatively high level, employment 
is also high, leading to more on-the-job accidents. Similarly, the rates of other 
causes of death, such as motor vehicle accident, rise in prosperous periods because 
people drive more.

 Summary and Conclusions 
 This chapter has used a macroeconomic perspective for investigating interactions 
between the health sector and economic sector. We first examined the link between 
the health sector and the economic sector based on dollar flows. Each country faces 
decisions about how much to allocate to the health sector and about sources of 
financing. Policy choices about sources of health care financing are influenced by 
several feedback effects on the performance of macroeconomies, including saving 
rates, labor market outcomes, and welfare losses. Specifically, the implementation 
of universal coverage reduces saving rates and female labor force participation. 
Similarly, the expansion of public means- and asset-tested insurance program 
reduces household saving rates. 
 We then examined the link between the health sector and the economic sector 
for the flow of goods and services. Health care services may be viewed as inputs 
in the production of health outputs. There are two stylized facts about trends in 
health inputs and outputs. First, at a single point in time, there is substantial varia-
tion in personal health expenditures and health outcomes, such as life expectancy 
at birth, among countries. Second, over time, all countries have experienced a very 
similar trend in growth of health expenditures and in longevity gains. An interest-
ing follow-up question explored in this chapter is to what extent the improvement 
in population health in general and longevity gain in particular are attributable to 
the growth in health inputs as measured by personal health expenditures. Although 
the analytic approaches used to explore this question have varied, the existing 
studies overall provide fairly consistent evidence that the increase in personal 
health expenditures in general and the adoption of new medical technology in 
particular have made substantial contributions to the improvements in health 
outcomes. 
 We also explored how the improvement in population health affects eco-
nomic sector. We identified several important channels through which better health 
may make a positive contribution to economic growth: (1) by a direct effect, in that 
healthier populations are more productive, and (2) by indirect effects, in that better

 729
health has a significant impact on education, saving, and demographic structure. 
Specifically, our analysis suggests that better health accounted for about 11 percent 
of the total growth rate. In addition, an increase in longevity leads to several effects 
that have a positive impact on economic growth, including an increase in formal 
education, higher saving rates, and an increase in the share of the working-age 
population in the total population. 
 Economic growth in turn may have feedback impacts on the health sector. 
However, whether the relationship between income growth and the improvement 
in health is causal or just a correlation is a debated issue. This is an avenue for 
future research.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 16.1  
 What is  “ precautionary saving ” ? What is the effect of purchasing health 
insurance on precautionary saving? Does this effect vary by income level? 
 16.2  
 If a country currently provides health insurance only to its employees, what 
effect on female labor force participation would you expect if the country 

730 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
decides to implement a national health insurance (NHI) program that 
expands the insurance coverage to all its citizens? Explain your answer. 
 16.3 
 Assume the country in 16.2 decides to use a personal income tax as the 
source of funds to finance the implementation of the NHI program. Specifi-
cally, the government announces it is raising the income tax rate by 5 
percent. Explain the potential effects of such a policy on labor supply. 
 16.4 
 What is a payroll tax? List three potential parties who bear the payroll tax 
if the government uses a payroll tax as the major source of health care financ-
ing. Discuss the impact of the payroll tax on the whole economy if the 
incidence of the payroll tax falls on alternative parties. 
 16.5 
 Based on the statistical data reported in   table 16.1 , the share of GDP spent 
on health care in every country increases over time. Do you expect this share 
to continue to rise in the future? Is it possible that a country such as the 
United States will spend more than 30 percent of its GDP on personal health 
care services in 2030? Explain why this would happen if you think so. 
 16.6 
 Which two stylized facts do international comparisons of health expendi-
tures show? Use two words to describe these stylized facts. Justify your 
answer. 
 16.7 
 What are three stylized facts about international comparisons of health 
outcomes? Use three words to describe these stylized facts. Justify your 
answer. 
 16.8 
 What do  “ causation ”  and  “ correlation ”  mean? Using the relationship 
between economic growth and health outcome as an example, show the 
importance of the distinction between causation and correlation. Then 
discuss the differences in policy implications in the following two cases: 
 a.  Economic growth  causes  an improvement in health outcome. 
 b.  Economic growth is positively  correlated   with  an improvement in health 
outcome. 
 16.9 
 Why is the health sector a  “ job machine ” ? In chapters 11 – 13, we described 
four different types of health care systems. Which type is most likely to be 
a job machine for a nation ’ s economy? 
 16.10  Why may economic recessions be good for health? Can you find some other 
evidence to support this argument? Why are suicides an exception? 
 16.11  Distinguish between  “ precautionary saving behavior ” and  “ life-cycle saving 
behavior. ” Suppose, following implementation of universal health insur-
ance, there is a substantial increase in life expectancy at birth. Use these 
two theories of saving behavior to explain the effect of implementing uni-
versal health insurance on saving behavior in the short and the long run.

 16.12   Use the framework in   figure 16.1  to explain the effect of population aging 
on the economic and health sectors, and feedbacks between the two. 
 Exercises 
 16.1   Collect data on health expenditures per capita (HE) and life expectancy at 
birth (LE) for at least fifteen countries in a given year, and run a simple regression 
in which LE is the dependent variable and HE is the independent variable. You can 
obtain data for these two variables from World Development Indicators published 
by the World Bank. What is the sign of your estimated coefficient? Is the parameter 
estimate statistically significant at the 5 percent level? How do you interpret your 
result? What kind of  “ bias ” might you have from this simple regression? 
 16.2   In recent years, many countries have begun to use a tobacco tax as a source 
of health care financing. In most cases, the tobacco tax is imposed in the form of 
excise tax, that is, the consumer pays a fixed amount of tax per pack of cigarettes. 
Does a tobacco tax create any deadweight loss to the society? If there is a dead-
weight loss associated with a tobacco tax, does the magnitude of the deadweight 
loss depend on the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes? 
 16.3   Use the concept of marginal efficiency of investment (MEI) and cost of 
capital (COC) described in chapters 2 and 9, and extend this framework to consider 
how parents decide the optimal year of educational investment for their children. 
Draw the MEI and COC lines on a graph, with the amount of educational invest-
ment (which could be measured by the number of years in school) on the  x -axis 
and the rate on the  y -axis. What are the shapes of the MEI and COC schedules? 
Explain intuitively why they look as they do. Based on this framework, can you 
predict the effect of reduction in child mortality on the parents ’ optimal investment 
in education for their children? Justify your answer. 
 16.4   Economists often use the following functional form (Cobb-Douglas produc-
tion function) to describe the aggregate production function of a country: 
 Y =  AK  α   H 1 – α  
 H =  h  ×  s  ×  L , 
 where  Y is output,  A is a country-specific productivity term,  K is physical capital, 
and  H is a labor composite, which in turn is determined by human capital in the 

732 
 Part IV / Chapter 16
form of health ( h ), human capital in the form of education ( s ), and the number of 
persons in the labor force ( L ). Use this functional form to show the direct effect of 
health on output and the indirect effect of health on output through education and 
saving behavior.

 Frontiers of Health Economics 
 This book concludes with a discussion of five ongoing controversies in health 
economics and in some cases in economics more generally. (1) Are people and 
institutions really rational and forward-looking in decision making, as economists 
generally assume? (2) How do people and institutions obtain information relevant 
to their decisions? To what extent does asymmetric information really affect the 
performance of health care markets, including markets for private health insur-
ance? (3) How do the way health care providers are paid and how they compete 
affect the performance of providers and social welfare more generally? (4) How 
does the regulatory process affect the behavior of regulated health care firms? (5) 
How do physicians really make clinical decisions, and how do these clinical deci-
sions affect the substantial geographic variation in expenditures within and among 
countries? 
 17.1 
 Rational versus Irrational Decision Making 
in Health Care 
 A key assumption in economic analysis is that people, as individual and household 
decision makers and as decision makers for organizations, are rational and forward-
looking optimizers. By rational, economists mean that decision makers use all 
information available to them when making choices, recognizing that information 
can be costly to obtain. For this reason, decisions are often based on incomplete 

738 
 Part IV / Chapter 17
information about the options. As optimizers, individuals make choices that yield 
the highest level of utility subject to the constraints they face. 
 Assumptions are not an end in themselves in economic analysis. Rather, they 
are part of the modeling process. Economists recognize that few of the assumptions 
they make are  “ realistic. ”  Models are judged by the accuracy of the predictions 
they offer rather than on how plausible the assumptions appear to be. 
 Some health and health care decisions are readily understood within a stan-
dard economic framework. For example, more medical care is demanded when 
there is complete insurance coverage for such services or when physicians are more 
willing to accept an insurer ’ s payment as payment in full at higher payment levels. 
 However, some decisions, while not necessarily inconsistent with standard 
economic models, at a minimum raise questions about whether or not they accu-
rately describe behavior. For example, why would people engage in behaviors that 
clearly impair personal health, such as smoking? Easy answers are  “ they are 
addicted ” or  “ they simply enjoy the activity so much that they do it ” without 
recognizing the long-term consequences of present actions. But another possibility 
is that the framework itself is not up to the task of adequately describing 
behavior. 
 Similarly, why do persons diagnosed with diabetes not follow health care 
regimens that have been documented in randomized controlled trials to reduce the 
onset of complications of the disease and about which there is no dispute among 
clinicians as to their efficacy? Personal health care decisions can be very major 
ones, especially after an individual has experienced a major adverse health event, 
such as being informed that he or she has been diagnosed with cancer. 
 The question of whether or not the assumption of rational and forward-
looking behavior is appropriate has been asked by economists in a number of 
decision-making contexts. Descriptions of alternative frameworks are now being 
taught in undergraduate courses in microeconomics. For example,  Frank (2006) , 
in a textbook on microeconomics but one that has a behavioral economics perspec-
tive, devotes an entire chapter to cognitive limitations and consumer behavior. The 
chapter discusses Herbert Simon ’ s concept of  “ bounded rationality, ” which led to 
Simon being awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics. Simon stressed the complexity 
of many decision problems. Consumers take shortcuts. Often they are  “ satisfiers ” 
rather than  “ maximizers. ”  Economists typically maintain that more choice is better 
than less choice. However, this may not be true for a boundedly rational 
individual. 
 Amos  Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1981 ), the latter a Nobel Laureate in 
Economics and the former a scholar who died before he could receive the Nobel 
Prize, argued that people use shortcuts in solving problems even when the 
problems are not all that complex. Accordingly, few individuals are the rational 
teenager contemplating whether or not to initiate the smoking habit whom we 
described in chapter 2. Richard  Thaler (1980)  argued that individuals treat gains 

Frontiers of Health Economics 
 739
and losses asymmetrically, not symmetrically, as in cost-benefit analysis.  Tversky 
and Kahneman (1974)  have argued that the von Neumann – Morgenstern expected 
utility model (chapter 2) is violated in many decisions people make under 
uncertainty. 
 Tversky and Kahneman described several types of biases they regarded as 
empirically relevant. Some events seem to stand out in people ’ s minds much more 
than do others, the  availability heuristic . For example, when asked whether homi-
cides or suicides are more common, people are likely to answer the former although 
the latter is true. Murders are more widely publicized and more easily recalled, 
especially if the victim was not personally known by the individual. People make 
inferences about attributes based on prior experience. For example, if a medical 
institution is famous, people might think that the quality of care is good for every 
type of case, even if this is not a valid assumption. Further, such  “ representative-
ness bias ” may substitute for effort to obtain information about quality in the 
specific case relevant to the individual ’ s decision.  Anchoring bias  occurs when 
individuals start with a preliminary estimate that could be virtually drawn at 
random, and then update from this value. The starting value has an important effect 
on the final value selected for the estimate. We discussed anchoring or starting-
point bias in chapter 15 in the context of eliciting estimates of maximum willing-
ness to pay for a service. 
 Underlying the assumption that people are rational and forward-looking is 
the assumption that people exercise self-control over their decisions. Once a deci-
sion is reached, there will be no problem in executing it. For example, if a person 
decides to save a given amount per month, she will do this, and not stop after a 
few months ( Ameriks, Caplin, and Leahy 2003 ;  Thaler and Benartzi 2004 ). Or, in 
a health context, a person who decides to quit smoking will not restart ( Schelling 
1984 ). More realistically, however, people may lack such self-control. Individuals 
may postpone executing certain decisions, saying,  “ I ’ ll call the doctor tomorrow ” 
or  “ I ’ ll start dieting next week. ” This type of postponing of decisions may reflect 
hyperbolic discounting ( O ’ Donoghue and Rabin 1999 ;  Gruber and K ö szegi 2001 ). 
 Even within the framework of rational forward-looking behavior, differences 
in time preference (e.g.,  Bickel, Odum, and Madden 1999 ;  Khwaja, Silverman, and 
Sloan 2007 ), risk preference (e.g.,  Barsky, Juster, Kimball, et al. 1997 ), and willing-
ness to pay for good health ( Khwaja, Sloan, and Wang 2009 ) can potentially account 
for differences in consumer behavior. That this can be so is well understood con-
ceptually by economists, but empirical evidence on these differences in preferences 
is incomplete. A further complication is that the differences in preferences we are 
able to observe may be context- or decision-specific. 
 Given the importance of decisions people make about their personal health 
and health care, health economics can provide a useful laboratory for studying 
consumer decision making. In the end, it may be that whether or not the assump-
tion of rational and forward-looking behavior is empirically relevant depends on 

740 
 Part IV / Chapter 17
the specific decision being made. The assumption of rational and forward-looking 
decision making may be valid in some contexts and not in others. 
 17.2  
 Information, Asymmetric Information, and Its 
Effects 
 How People Obtain Information 
 In an idealized perfectly competitive market, market participants possess perfect 
knowledge about the alternatives. A more nuanced insight is that information is 
not free, but rather comes at a cost. To the extent that information becomes more 
costly, people choose to be partially ignorant. Critical to the operation of competi-
tive health care markets is that obtaining information about cost and quality and 
other attributes of various options is not too costly. There was a time, thankfully 
mostly in the past, when physicians were assumed to know everything and patients 
were assumed to know practically nothing. Societies relied on professional ethics 
to prevent patients from being duped. 
 In sharp contrast to the situation three or four decades ago, there is now 
widespread recognition that health care providers are not omniscient and patients 
are capable of learning. For a competitive market or even one that is not perfectly 
competitive to exist, consumers as patients must know quite a bit about their 
options, including the pros and cons of various options open to them. These 
options include choice of health plan (in countries with a choice) and providers, 
as well as choices made conditional on these choices being made. Since a lot of 
health is produced by the individual him- or herself, knowledge extends beyond 
health care to decisions about health behaviors that are not directly observable 
by health care providers. 
 We know comparatively little about the cost to consumers of obtaining health 
care information, how consumers process the information they obtain, and what 
the potential of programs aimed at improving consumer information about health 
and health care really is. Although they have much more basic information than 
consumers do, the same could be said of physicians and other health care provid-
ers. How do providers learn about the range of outcomes from various therapies 
and how the marginal products of specific therapies vary according to the charac-
teristics of the individual patient, such as educational attainment and age? 
 Lack of adequate information and asymmetric information between patients 
and providers underlie many of the market failures in health care. Not surprisingly, 
economists and others have tended to view public policies that involve dissemina-
tion of information as necessarily welfare-improving. As a practical matter, however, 
the extent to which welfare is actually improved depends on the quality of the 
information and the process by which it is disseminated. 

Frontiers of Health Economics 
 741
 One approach in the United States has been to encourage dissemination 
of information on the performance of hospitals in the form of report cards 
( Gowrisankaran 2008 ). Report cards provide measures of the process of care or 
outcomes for a common set of conditions diagnosed and treated in hospitals. 
The problem is not with the concept but possibly with the details of imple-
mentation. When report cards are based on a few indicators, as is inevitable 
to a certain extent, providers have an incentive to game the system, that is, to 
perform well on the indicators that are measured, possibly at the cost of poorer 
performance on indicators that are not measured. When report cards are based on 
outcome measures, there is an incentive for hospitals to accept less severely ill 
patients for treatment, thus creating access barriers for more severely ill patients. 
Further, some hospitals are very small, so that sample sizes with respect to out-
comes are too small to generate reliable measures of performance in the outcome 
domain. 
 For better or worse, patients may not rely much on report cards. They may 
not be sufficiently empowered to choose hospitals, given the important role of 
physicians in the referral decision, and consumers may also have information on 
dimensions of quality that are not monitored and hence are unreported. Moreover, 
the empirical evidence to date does not make a clear case that consumer welfare 
has been improved by report cards. In countries that place less reliance than the 
United States does on consumer decision making in health care, the role of infor-
mation dissemination of any sort is quite limited. 
 When the choice of the hospital is left to the physician, there is a question 
of the information base used by physicians when making the hospital admission 
decision on behalf of patients. Until very recently, physicians were unlikely to have 
had access to any source of information even resembling report cards. The decision 
was made on the basis of impressions about quality of care or perhaps convenience 
to the patient and the patient ’ s family, and in some cases, simply the convenience 
of the doctor him-or herself. 
 Similarly, when health plans, such as those in the United States, form net-
works of providers (see chapter 11), what is the information base on which they 
rely? And how do health plans update their beliefs about the quality of care offered 
by individual providers in their networks? 
 Very little is known about how health care decision makers update their 
beliefs in the health care context or in other contexts (see, e.g.,  Sacerdote 2001 ; 
 Hanushek, Kain, Markman, et al. 2003 ;  Argys and Rees 2008 ). Peers are a likely 
source of information on attributes of health care providers, the effects of various 
health behaviors, and choice of health plans, among other decisions. Currently we 
have insufficient information on peer networks, how they operate, and how infor-
mation obtained through peer networks influences decisions about health care and 
health. Interesting studies have been conducted, such as a recent study of learning 
about the effects of deworming programs in Kenya ( Kremer and Miguel 2007 ), but 

742 
 Part IV / Chapter 17
at present, lacking more direct information, researchers must make specific assump-
tions about how information is transmitted. 
 Lack of information is a reason why moral hazard and adverse selection exist. 
All insurers face exceptional hurdles in monitoring the benefits of use of covered 
services, given the patient-provider relationship, the importance of maintaining 
confidentiality, heterogeneity of patients and patients ’ illnesses, and professional 
norms. If health were perfectly observable and hence care regimens conditional on 
health changes perfectly contractible, moral hazard could not exist (see, e.g.,  Vera-
Hernandez 2003 ). The insurer would have an exact measure of the insured indi-
vidual ’ s health and could determine whether or not a particular service was 
justified. Moral hazard exists because such precise information is unavailable. This 
gives the patient and provider some room in which to maneuver. With improve-
ments in information technology, one should expect corresponding improvements 
in characterizing patient health and at the same time in measuring care that is 
provided in the health states thus characterized. 
 Adverse selection in health insurance markets arises because consumers 
possess private information that health insurers do not have. Based on his review 
of the evidence,  Pauly (2008)  concluded that concerns about adverse selection in 
health insurance markets have been overemphasized. He argued that when adverse 
selection occurs to any considerable extent, it is due to some type of regulation 
that requires insurers to ignore information that they have or could have obtained. 
 In other words, adverse selection arises not so much because insurers lack 
knowledge but because they are unable to obtain relevant information owing to 
regulations or social prohibitions against such information gathering. An example 
of adverse selection in employer groups was provided in chapter 10 in the example 
of Harvard University switching to a fixed contribution on behalf of employees. 
Empirical evidence on the relative importance of asymmetric information and 
limits on information acquisition by insurers is currently lacking. 
 Adverse selection in a variety of insurance markets has piqued the interest 
of economists who focus on microeconomics. One line of research has questioned 
whether or not the selection process is necessarily in the direction of adverse selec-
tion. Rather, sometimes the selection process may be reversed in the direction of 
 “ advantageous selection. ” For example, suppose that drivers who purchase more 
comprehensive automobile liability policies are risk averse not only when it comes 
to buying insurance but also in their driving behavior. Then persons who demand 
relatively complete coverage may be more careful, not less careful, drivers. That 
is, the selection of high-option insurance plans may be advantageous rather than 
adverse.  Cohen and Einav (2007)  examined whether risk aversion can serve as a 
source of advantageous selection counteracting the adverse selection based on ex 
post risk and found that the result goes in the opposite direction: more risk-averse 
drivers seem to have higher, not lower, accident risks. 

Frontiers of Health Economics 
 743
 Previous work on asymmetric information in automobile insurance markets, 
such as that by  Chiappori and Salanie (2000) , which treats private information as 
unidimensional — that is, people know they are risk averse while insurers do not 
know an individual ’ s risk preferences — found no correlation between ex post risk 
(e.g., whether or not a person had an accident at some time after the insurance 
policy was purchased) and the nature of the contract (as measured by the complete-
ness of insurance coverage), suggesting that there is no asymmetric information in 
such markets. However, others (e.g.,  Finkelstein and McGarry 2006 ) have specu-
lated that private information may potentially occur in multiple dimensions, such 
as risk aversion, in the context of long-term care insurance purchasing decisions 
and a distaste for nursing home stays in the case of insurance coverage for nursing 
home care. People who really hate the thought of living in a nursing home may be 
both less likely to purchase comprehensive insurance coverage for nursing home 
care  and , conditional on being insured for such care, less likely to enter a nursing 
home, which can be observed ex post by insurers after the person dies following 
an end-of-life illness that would have caused many of them to enter a nursing home. 
 17.3 
 Industrial Organization of the Health Care 
Sector 
 Principal-Agent Issues: Physicians 
 In health care as in many other sectors, health care, consumers, the principals, rely 
on others, the agents, for advice on consumption decisions. Often the agent stands 
to gain when there is a transaction. Car salespersons and mechanics and real estate 
agents are cases in point. An auto mechanic diagnoses a car problem and provides 
recommendation for action, where action typically involves the mechanic himself. 
Department store salespersons have a role in advising consumers about their 
options. In these cases, the agent has a self-interest that may run counter to the 
self-interest of the principal. These arrangements persist, perhaps because of wide-
spread faith in the notion that market pressures from competition among agents 
will in the end force agents to act in the principals ’ interest. At least in the long 
run, if an agent mainly acts in his or her own interest without sufficient regard to 
the principal ’ s interest, the agent will lose business to competitors who act in the 
principal ’ s interest. 
 In the case of cars, there are alternative sources of information. Consumers 
can read publications that rate cars. And real estate offerings can be found in 
newspapers and on the Internet. 
 There are situations in which the relationship between the principal and the 
agent may be even more asymmetric than in the above examples. For example, if 

744 
 Part IV / Chapter 17
a person is charged with a felony and retains a lawyer, he or she can only hope 
that the lawyer is a good one and represents his or her interests. While the client 
can appeal to the state bar or perhaps ask for a retrial, the transactions cost of 
addressing failed representation can be substantial. Further, if a person is diag-
nosed with cancer, given the trauma of the diagnosis and often the immediate need 
for treatment, the principal can only hope that the agent will take his or her best 
interests to heart. Some but not all medical care falls into this category. Even if 
physician decision making is not fully motivated by financial self-interest, it may 
depend on adherence to practices learned from mentors or some other factor, with 
the result that care may not be fully in the patient ’ s interest. 
 The method according to which physicians are paid is particularly important 
in situations in which the physician is empowered relative to patients. Countries 
have faced different choices in how physicians are paid. One method is a fixed 
salary per unit of time; another is fee-for-service practice. Still another is a combi-
nation of salary and fee-for-service ( McGuire 2008 ). One common approach is to 
employ the physician in a clinic on a salaried basis but allow the physician to 
practice on a fee-for-service basis on the physician ’ s own time. Still another 
approach is to pay physicians on a capitated (per patient) basis, as general practi-
tioners in the UK are paid. With asymmetric information, the risk is that the physi-
cian will put forth too little effort when compensated on straight salary or on a 
capitated basis. And when paid on a piece rate basis, that is, fee for service, there 
is the risk of overprovision of services. 
 With some exceptions (e.g.,  Hickson, Altemeier, and Perrin 1987 ), carefully 
controlled studies of the effects of physician compensation on physicians ’ deci-
sions about care are lacking. Given the importance of physician compensation 
policy in all countries, such studies merit a high priority. 
 Pay for Performance 
 Pay is only one type of reward for services provided. Other rewards take the form 
of professional pride, recognition, opportunities to do challenging work, regular 
hours of work, and supportive colleagues. In fact, the theory of compensating wage 
differentials argues that people are willing to be paid less for attributes of jobs that 
they value, such as vacation time or a pleasant work atmosphere, or require to be 
paid more for attributes they dislike, such as jobs with a high risk of injury on the 
job. In this sense, high nonfinancial rewards should substitute for pay. There is an 
argument that increased extrinsic rewards, such as higher financial rewards, may 
devalue intrinsic awards, such as the warm glow from doing good for others while 
on the job. This implies that physicians and other professionals may be willing to 
provide some services for altruistic reasons, but once an explicit price is attached 
to these services, their value is diminished to some extent. 
 A proposed alternative to attaching prices to units of service, as has been 
common practice for physician and hospital services, is to pay for performance, 

Frontiers of Health Economics 
 745
that is, to pay higher prices to reward better outcomes (see  Golden and Sloan 2008  
for a review of this literature). This raises the question of whether performance 
should be based on certain care processes being performed (e.g., whether certain 
medications are prescribed after a heart attack) or on outcomes of care (e.g., rates 
of survival or health indicators at a certain period after a heart attack. Physicians 
and hospitals may prefer to be paid for following a process rather than on outcome 
results on the grounds that they are risk averse and outcomes also depend in 
important ways on factors outside the provider ’ s control. Moreover, there are ques-
tions about the validity and reliability of specific outcome indicators as measures 
of performance. In the end, health care is heterogeneous. Pay for performance may 
provide a better fit for some types of services than for others, such as for services 
for which health outcomes are easily monitored. 
 There is some empirical research on pay-for-performance systems (see, e.g., 
 Rosenthal and Frank 2006  for health care and  Jensen and Murphy 1990  and  Hall 
and Liebman 1998 for evidence from other industries). This important research is 
still in its infancy. 
 Competition among Hospitals 
 Likewise, there is still much to be learned about how hospitals compete when they 
are able to compete. Important issues about hospital competition include the 
impact of such competition on quality of care and on prices. That greater competi-
tion in a market leads to higher quality or a greater variety of goods or services in 
general cannot be deduced from economic theory alone. Rather, this is an issue to 
be settled empirically. A case can be made that competition among hospitals raises 
or lowers the quality of care. If competition does not take place on price, hospitals 
may boost quality in order to attract patients. However, if consumers or physicians 
acting in their role of agents are unable to assess the quality of a hospital accurately, 
hospitals may cut corners so that they can offer care at a lower price and still remain 
profitable. 
 Not only do we not know that competition raises the quality of hospital care, 
if in fact it does, but also we do not know how these changes compare to the nor-
mative benchmark of socially optimal care. In other words, it is possible that 
competition among sellers of health care services raises quality, but quality may 
be increased to a level above that at which marginal social benefit equals marginal 
social cost. 
 A major insight of economics is that higher quality is not always better from 
the standpoint of social welfare. It can be too high as well as too low. Hospitals 
often justify mergers with other hospitals on the basis of efficiencies, including the 
consolidation of services that may be realized as a result of the merger. Yet these 
efficiencies remain to be documented empirically. 
 Empirical studies of industrial organization of health care have been largely 
confined to the United States. Studies are needed in other countries, including 

746 
 Part IV / Chapter 17
middle-income and low-income countries. We have discussed public and private 
provision of services in chapters 11 – 13. Head-to-head cross-country comparisons 
of performance in various countries that organize health services differently are 
difficult to make; these comparisons have been done mainly between the United 
States and Canada (e.g.,  Mark, Naylor, Hlatky, et al. 1994 ). 
 17.4 
 Competition versus Public Regulation versus 
Public Ownership in Health Care 
 Countries face choices about public versus private ownership and, within private 
ownership, between for-profit and private not-for-profit organizational forms (see 
chapters 6 and 11 – 13). When ownership is private, there is a policy question about 
both the types of public regulation that are appropriate and the allocation of 
resources to regulatory oversight and enforcement of the regulated private entities. 
Most often regulatory rules are implemented with the implicit assumption that the 
rules themselves will automatically fix the problem that regulation addresses, be 
it pricing, the solvency of the regulated organization, or the quantity or quality of 
services provided. 
 In countries that rely on private financing or the private provision of services, 
there has been a substantial amount of regulation in health care markets, in the 
United States beginning in the twentieth century, with a rapid acceleration in such 
regulation following World War II. Regulations cover market entry (e.g., physician 
licensure, hospital health planning, certificate of need), pricing (regulation of hos-
pital and pharmaceutical prices, regulation of insurance premiums), product offer-
ings (e.g., requirements that private insurers cover certain types of health care 
services, including parity for mental and physical health), and activities of not-for-
profit providers (e.g., requirements that not-for-profit hospitals offer certain unprof-
itable services as a payback for the tax exemptions that they have). In various 
chapters of this book, we have stressed the potential importance of regulations on 
choices that are made, such as the effect of price controls on pharmaceutical manu-
facturers ’ decisions to invest in R & D on a new product. 
 The pendulum against regulation may well swing in the opposite direction 
in the future. This appears to be happening in financial markets, and this trend 
may well spread to health care. Especially to the extent that these changes occur, 
it will be important to model the regulatory decision-making process and document 
empirically how regulatory decisions affect outcomes. Further, there is substantial 
heterogeneity among countries in the contexts in which specific regulatory policies 
are adopted, the specific features of the regulatory process, and the effects of such 
policies on outcomes. There is more, for example, for experts in the United States 
to learn about how hospital entry regulation operates in practice in countries that 

Frontiers of Health Economics 
 747
view capital budgeting as a collective choice (i.e., the state has a capital budget) 
versus a system like that in the United States, where the state health planning 
authorities do not have a budget but rather view each certificate-of-need applica-
tion largely on an individual basis. 
 In addition, although the correlation is not perfect, in general, health care 
provision becomes more private as countries attain higher levels of per capita 
income. While there are some benefits to privatization, there are likely to be some 
costs as well. Important research on outcomes before and after privatization of 
health care providers remains to be conducted. 
 17.5 
 Clinical Decision Making 
 There is an important distinction between positive and normative economics. 
Positive economics studies the behavioral responses of various actors in a 
market. Rather than focus on what is, normative economics prescribes what should 
be. Most of this book has been devoted to positive economics. For example, 
the emphasis has been on how the market for physicians ’ services operates in 
practice rather than on how it should work. In this sense, we have focused on 
gaining a better understanding of physician decision making rather than recom-
mending how physicians might make better decisions. Important exceptions to this 
generality are chapters 14 and 15, which discuss cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit 
analysis. 
 Many health economists are employed in a subfield called  pharmacoeconom-
ics . Practitioners in this field conduct cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmaceuti-
cals and other health care technologies. 
 While there are some important methodological innovations, most cost-effec-
tiveness analysis applies existing techniques. There remain important unresolved 
issues. First, cost-effectiveness analysis remains dominant because of a general 
reluctance to quantify health care benefits in monetary terms. Yet in deciding how 
much to allocate to a particular product, quantifying in monetary terms is implicit. 
For example, even if a technology is described in terms of dollars per life years 
saved, in deciding how much to spend on the technology, someone must decide 
what a life year saved is actually worth. 
 In an important sense, physicians ’ and public policy makers ’ reluctance to 
place a dollar value on a life year saved, a QALY (see chapter 14), or other types 
of health outcomes is understandable, given the limits of existing methodologies 
for quantifying health benefits in monetary terms. This is especially true in light 
of the types of cognitive biases described in chapter 2 and earlier in this chapter. 
Refinement of techniques for eliciting individuals ’ maximum willingness to pay 
for particular health benefits should be a high priority. Given cognitive biases, there 

748 
 Part IV / Chapter 17
is also a question about whose preferences to quantify. Suppose the issue is will-
ingness to pay for a treatment for a specific disease. Can people who have never 
experienced the disease accurately assign a value of the utility gain from 
treatment? 
 Another set of issues relates to how physicians made decisions about patient 
care. There is substantial variation in treatment patterns in a country like the 
United States (see, e.g.,  Fowler, Gallagher, Anthony, et al. 2008 ;  Zuckerman, 
Waidmann, Berenson, et al. 2010 ), and in other countries as well (see, e.g.,  Magan, 
Otero, Alberquilla, et al. 2008 ). But except for describing such variation, there is 
currently a lack of understanding about why such variation exists. For example, 
why do cesarean section rates differ so markedly within countries and across 
countries? Certainly, biological factors alone cannot explain this difference. Pre-
sumably the preferences of pregnant women affect the choice of mode of obstetric 
delivery in part, but it seems likely that a major part of the decision reflects what 
the physician recommends. What is needed is more empirical analysis of the physi-
cian decision-making process. While health economists have something to contrib-
ute to this area of inquiry, experts in many other fields have an important role to 
play as well. 
 17.6 
 Final Word 
 This book has covered a lot of territory. Before you began this journey, you may 
have thought that health economics is a narrow topic, and many scholars with 
postgraduate degrees share this opinion. In reality, the field is incredibly broad, 
spanning many parts of the health sector as well as drawing on many other disci-
plines — medicine, law, corporate finance — and many subfields of economics, such 
as industrial organization, public economics, labor economics, econometrics, and 
risk, uncertainty, and insurance. Further, although health economics is seen as a 
field in applied microeconomics, as discussed in chapter 16, health economics also 
relates to the macroeconomy, and to economic development and growth. 
 For some readers, this will be the last course in health economics specifi-
cally, but you may take courses in other economic fields that relate to topics 
in health economics or use similar analytic methods. Some readers will graduate 
and enter a health profession. Others will graduate and enter some other field, 
but as individual household members or citizen voters will face decisions 
involving the allocation of resources to health care. Hopefully, a few readers will 
decide to become health economists. Whatever your future, we hope that this book 
has provided relevant and useful material, and that you will regard this experience 
as a beginning in a lifelong interest in some aspect of what this book has 
discussed.

 Review and Discussion Questions 
 17.1   What is  “ bounded rationality ” ? Using smoking behavior as example, explain 
how the concept of the bounded rationality answers the question of  “ why 
people continue to smoke although they have full information on the adverse 
consequence of cigarette smoking on health. ” 
 17.2   What do we mean when we say that  “ people may lack self control ” ? Is this 
argument consistent with the assumption of rational choice? Governments 
around the world have adopted public policies to control tobacco consump-
tion, including information provision, restricting smoking in public places, 
and imposing exercise taxes on tobacco products. If people lack self-control, 
what is the most effective policy for tobacco control? 
 17.3   What is advantageous selection? List three examples of advantageous selec-
tion in the real world. 
 17.4   Explain the distinction between fee for service and pay for performance in 
health care markets. Which payment system is in a better position to incentiv-
ize the provision of higher-quality health care? Justify your answer. 
 17.5   Distinguish between positive economics and normative economics. Using 
inequality in health (as measured by life expectancy at birth) within a country 
as an example, list three research questions that can be answered by positive

economics and another three research questions that can be answered by 
normative economics. 
 17.6  Compare the approaches of  “ market competition ” and  “ public regulation ” to 
promote quality of hospital care in a health system in which private hospitals 
dominate the market. Is there any precondition under which market competi-
tion is in a better position to achieve a higher quality of hospital care level 
than public regulation does? Explain your answer 
 17.7  What are  “ principal-agent issues ” in health care markets? Give three exam-
ples from health care markets. Principal-agent issues prevail not only in 
health care markets; they exist in other markets, too. List three examples of 
principal-agent issues in other markets.
