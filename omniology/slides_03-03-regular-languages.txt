Regular Languages 
Choose the regular languages that 
are equivalent to the given regular language:  (0 + 1)*1(0 + 1)*
 
 
 
 
(01 + 11)*(0 + 1)* 
(0 + 1)*(10 + 11 + 1)(0 + 1)* 
(1 + 0)*1(1 + 0)* 
(0+ 1)*(0 + 1)(0 + 1)* 
 S = { 0, 1 }

• Five constructs 
– Two base cases 
• empty and 1-character strings 
 
– Three compound expressions 
• union, concatenation, iteration
