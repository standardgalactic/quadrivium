Conservative Collection

Conservative Collection 
• Garbage collection relies on being able to find all 
reachable objects 
– and it needs to find all pointers in an object 
 
• In C or C++ it is impossible to identify the contents of 
objects in memory 
– E.g., a sequence of two memory words might be 
• A  list cell (with data and next fields) 
• A binary tree node (with left and right fields) 
– Thus we cannot tell where all the pointers are

• But it is Ok to be conservative: 
– if a memory word looks like a pointer it is considered a pointer 
• it must be aligned 
• it must point to a valid address in the data segment 
– all such pointers are followed and we overestimate the set of 
reachable objects 
 
• But we still cannot move objects because we cannot update 
pointers to them 
– what if what we thought to be a pointer is actually an account 
number?
