REAL NUMBERS
At the very foundations of mathematics is the concept of a set or collection of objects
and, in particular, sets of numbers on which we base our quantitative work in science and
engineering. The student is already familiar with the following important sets of numbers.
1. Natural Numbers 1,2,3,4, ... or positive integers used in counting.
2. Integers 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... These numbers arose in order to provide meaning to
subtraction [inverse of addition] of any two natural numbers. 
Thus 2 — 6 = —4,
8-8 = 0, etc.
3. Rational Numbers such as 2/3, —10/7, etc. arose in order to provide meaning to division
[inverse of multiplication] or quotient of any two integers with the exception that
division by zero is not defined.
4. Irrational Numbers such as \/2, *, etc. are numbers which cannot be expressed as the
quotient of two integers.
Note that the set of natural numbers is a subset, i.e. a part, of the set of integers which in
turn is a subset of the set of rational numbers.
The set of numbers which are either rational or irrational is called the set of real
numbers [to distinguish them from imaginary or complex numbers on page 11] and is com-
posed of positive and negative numbers and zero. The real numbers can be represented as
points on a line as indicated in Fig. 1-1. For this reason we often use point and number
interchangeably.
The student is also familiar with the concept of inequality. Thus we say that the real
number a is greater than or less than b [symbolized by a > b or a <b] if a — b is a positive
or negative number respectively. For any real numbers a and b we must have a > b,
a = b or a < b.
RULES OF ALGEBRA
If a, b, c are any real numbers, the following rules of algebra hold.
1. 
a + b = b + a 
Commutative law for addition
2. a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c 
Associative law for addition
3. 
ab = ba 
Commutative law for multiplication
4. 
a(bc) — (ab)c 
Associative law for multiplication
5. 
a(b + c) — ab + ac 
Distributive law

REVIEW OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 
[CHAP. 1
It is from these rules [if we accept them as axioms or postulates] that we can prove the
usual rules of signs, as for example (-5)(3) = -15, (-2)(-3) = 6, etc.
The student is also familiar with the usual rules of exponents:
(Í)
FUNCTIONS
Another important concept is that of function. The student will recall that a function
/ is a rule which assigns to each object x, also called member or element, of a set A an
element y of a set B. To indicate this correspondence we write y = /(«) where f(x) is
called the value of the function at x.
Example 1. If /(») = a;2 - 3x + 2, then /(2) = 22- 3(2) + 2 = 0.
The student is also familiar with the process of "graphing functions" by obtaining
number pairs (a;, y) and considering these as points plotted on an xy coordinate system. In
general y = f(x) is represented graphically by a curve. Because y is usually determined
from x, we sometimes call x the independent variable and y the dependent variable.
SPECIAL TYPES OF FUNCTIONS
1. Polynomials f(x) = a<>x
n + aix"'1 + azxn~2 + • • • +an. If a0^0, n is called the degree
of the polynomial. The polynomial equation f(x) = 0 has exactly n roots provided we
count repetitions. For example a;3 - 3a;2 + 3a; -1 = 0 can be written (x - I)3 = 0 so
that the 3 roots are 1,1,1. Note that here we have used the binomial theorem
where the binomial coefficients are given by
and where factorial n, i.e. nl, = n(n— !)(•» — 2) • • • 1 while 0! = 1 by definition.
2. Exponential Functions f(x) = ax. These functions obey the rules (1).
An important special case occurs where a = e = 2.7182818
3. Logarithmic Functions f(x) — loga x. These functions are inverses of the exponential
functions, i.e. if ax = y then x = logay where a is called the base of the logarithm.
Interchanging x and y gives y = logo x. If a = e, which is often called the natural
base of logarithms, we denote log«a; by mo:, called the natural logarithm of x. 
The
fundamental rules satisfied by natural logarithms [or logarithms to any base] are
(*)
4. Trigonometric Functions sin», cosa;, tana;, cotx, seca;, ese a;.
Some fundamental relationships among these functions are as follows.

CHAP. 1]
REVIEW OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS
(6) sin2 x + cos2 x — 1, 
sec2 x — tan2 x — 1, 
esc2 x — cot2 x = 1
(c) 
sin (—a;) = — sin x, 
cos (—x) = cos x, 
tan (—a;) = — tan x
(d) 
sin (x ± y) = sin x cos y ± cos x sin y, 
cos (a; ± #) = cos x cos 2/ T sin a; sin #
(e) 
A cos a; + B sin a; = 
where tan a = A/B
The trigonometric functions are periodic. For example sin* and cosa;, shown in
Fig. 1-2 and 1-3 respectively, have period 2ir.
Fig. 1-2
Fig. 1-3
5. Inverse Trigonometric Functions sin"1 a;, cos"1 a;, tan"1 a;, cot"1 a;, sec"1 a;, csc^a;.
These are inverses of the trigonometric functions. 
For example if sin x = y then
x = sin"1 y, or on interchanging x and y, y = sin"1 x.
6. Hyperbolic Functions. These are defined in terms of exponential functions as follows.
Some fundamental identities analogous to those for trigonometric functions are
(Z>) cosh2 x — sinh2 x = I, 
sech2a; + tanh2a; = 1, 
coth2 x — csch2 x = 1
(c) 
sinh (a; ± y) = sinh x cosh y ± cosh x sinh y
cosh (a; ± y) = cosh x cosh y ± sinh x sinh y
tanh(x±y) —
The inverse hyperbolic functions, given by sinh"1 a;, cosh"1 a;, etc. can be expressed
in terms of logarithms [see Problem 1.9, for example].
LIMITS
The function f(x) is said to have the limit I as x approaches a, abbreviated lim f(x) = I,
if given any number e > 0 we can find a number 8 > 0 such that |/(a;) — Z| < « whenever
0< |*-a| <8.
Note that \p\, i.e. the absolute value of p, is equal to p if p > 0, — p if p < 0 and 0 if
p = 0.

REVIEW OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 
[CHAP. 1
If 
then we have the following theorems on limits.
CONTINUITY
The function f(x) is said to be continuous at a if lim f(x) = /(a).
z-»a
Example 3. f(x) = x2 — 4x + 8 is continuous at x = 1. However, if f(x) =
then f(x) is not continuous [or is discontinuous] at x = 2 and x = 2 is called a
discontinuity of /(a;).
If f(x) is continuous at each point of an interval such as Xi ^ x ^ x¡ or x\ < x ë a;2,
etc., it is said to be continuous in the interval.
If fi(x) and fa(x) are continuous in an interval then fi(x) ± /z(a;), fi(x)fz(x) 
and
f\(x)lfz(x) 
where /2(a;) ¥= 0 are also continuous in the interval.
DERIVATIVES
The derivative of y = /(a;) at a point a; is defined as
(5)
where 
provided the limit exists.
The differential 
of y = f(x) is defined by
dy = /'(a;) dx where da; = Aa; 
(6)
The process of finding derivatives is called differentiation. 
By taking derivatives of
y' = dy/dx — f'(x) we can find second, third and higher order derivatives, denoted by
y" = d?yldxz = f"(x), y'" = d3y/dx3 = f'"(x), etc.
Geometrically the derivative of a function f(x) at a point represents the slope of the
tangent line drawn to the curve y — f(x) at the point.
If a function has a derivative at a point, then it is continuous at the point. However,
the converse is not necessarily true.
DIFFERENTIATION FORMULAS
In the following u, v represent functions of x while a, c, p represent constants. We
assume of course that the derivatives of u and v exist, i.e. u and v are 
differentiable.

CHAP. 1] 
REVIEW OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 
5
In the special case where u = x, the above formulas are simplified since in such case
du/dx = 1.
INTEGRALS
If dy/dx = f(x), then we call y an indefinite integral or anti-derivative of f(x) and
denote it by
(7)
Since the derivative of a constant is zero, all indefinite integrals of f(x) can differ only by
a constant.
The definite integral of f(x) between x = a and x = b is defined as
(«)
provided this limit exists. Geometrically if f(x) =£ 0, this represents the area under the
curve y = f(x) bounded by the x axis and the ordinates at x — a and x = b. The integral
will exist if f(x) is continuous in a a x a b.
Definite and indefinite integrals are related by the following theorem.
Theorem 1-1 [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]. 
If f(x) = -p g(x), then
The process of finding integrals is called integration.
INTEGRATION FORMULAS
In the following u,v represent functions of x while a,b,c,p represent constants. In
all cases we omit the constant of integration, which nevertheless is implied.

This is called integration by parts.

SEQUENCES AND SERIES
A sequence, indicated by u\, u2, ... or briefly by (un), is a function defined on the set of
natural numbers. The sequence is said to have the limit I or to converge to I, if given any
« > 0 there exists a number N > 0 such that 
for all n > N, and in such case
we write lim un = I. If the sequence does not converge we say that it diverges.
n-* «
Consider the sequence u\, Ui + u2, Ui + u2 + us, ... or Si, Si, Sa, ... where Sn =
Ui + uz + • • • +Un. We call <Sn) the sequence of partial sums of the sequence (un). 
The
symbol
Ui + uz + us + • • • 
or 
or briefly 
(9)
is defined as synonymous with (Sn) and is called an infinite series. This series will converge
or diverge according as (Sn) converges or diverges. If it converges to S we call S the sum
of the series.
The following are some important theorems concerning infinite series.
Theorem 1-2. The series 
converges if p > 1 and diverges if pal.
Theorem 1-3. If

Theorem 1-4.

Theorem 1-6. The series

exists or does not exist.
This theorem is often called the integral test.
Theorem 1-7. The series 
diverges if 
However, if 
the
series may or may not converge [see Problem 1.31].
Theorem 1-8. Suppose that 
Then the series 2un converges (absolutely)
if r < 1 and diverges if r > 1. If r = 1, no conclusion can be drawn.
This theorem is often referred to as the ratio test.
The above ideas can be extended to the case where the un are functions of x denoted
by Un(x). In such case the sequences or series will converge or diverge according to the
particular values of x. The set of values of x for which a sequence or series converges is
called the region of convergence, denoted by ^.
Example 5. The series 1 + x + xz + x3 + • • • has a region of convergence 'K. [in this case an
interval] given by — 1 < * < 1 if we restrict ourselves to real values of x.
UNIFORM CONVERGENCE
We can say that the series ui(x) + Uz(x) + • • • converges to the sum S(x) in a region "3^
if given e > 0 there exists a number N, which in general depends on both « and x, such
that |S(a;) — Sn(x}\ < f whenever n>N where Sn(x) = Ui(x)+ • • • + Um(x). 
If we can find
N depending only on e and not on x, we say that the series converges uniformly to S(x) in
% Uniformly convergent series have many important advantages as indicated in the
following theorems.
Theorem 1-9. If Un(x), n = 1,2,3, ... are continuous in a ë x à & and 2un(x) is uni-
formly convergent to S(x) in a a x a b, then S(x) is continuous in
a = x = 6.
Theorem 1-10. If ~S.Un(x) converges uniformly to S(x) in a ë x a b and un(x), n = 1,2,3, ...
are integrable in a ë x ë b, then
Theorem 1-11. If Un(x], n — 1,2,3,... are continuous and have continuous derivatives in
a ë x ë b and if ~S,un(x) converges to S(x) while 2ui(x) is uniformly con-
vergent in a a x ë b, then
An important test for uniform convergence, often called the Weierstrass M test, is
given by the following.
Theorem 1-12. If there is a set of positive constants Mn, n=l,2,3, ... such that

[and also absolutely convergent] in <^.

TAYLOR SERIES
The Taylor series for f(x) about x = a is defined as
(10)
where 
*o between a and x 
(11)
is called the remainder and where it is supposed that f(x) has derivatives of order n at
least. The case where n = 1 is often called the law of the mean or mean-value theorem
and can be written as
xo between a and x 
(12)
The infinite series corresponding to (10), also called the formal Taylor series for f(x),
will converge in some interval if limí¿n = 0 in this interval. Some important Taylor
n»+°o
series together with their intervals of convergence are as follows.

A series of the form 
is often called a power series. Such power series are
uniformly convergent in any interval which lies entirely within the interval of convergence
[see Problem 1.120],
FUNCTIONS OF TWO OR MORE VARIABLES
The concept of function of one variable given on page 2 can be extended to functions of
two or more variables. Thus for example z = f(x, y) defines a function / which assigns
to the number pair (a;, y) the number z.
Example 6. If f(x, y) - x2 + Sxy + 2y*, then /(-1,2) = (-1)2 + 3(-l)(2) + 2(2)2 = 3.
The student is familiar with graphing 2 = f(x, y) in a 3-dimensional xyz coordinate
system to obtain a surface. 
We sometimes call x and y independent variables and z a
dependent variable. Occasionally we write z = z(x, y) rather than z — f(x, y), using the
symbol z in two different senses. However, no confusion should result.
The ideas of limits and continuity for functions of two or more variables pattern closely
those for one variable.
PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
The partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x and y are defined by

REVIEW OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS
if these limits exist. We often write 
Note that df/dx is simply the ordinary
derivative of / with respect to x keeping y constant, while df/dy is the ordinary derivative of
/ with respect to y keeping x constant. Thus the usual differentiation formulas on pages
4 and 5 apply.
Example 7. If f(x, y) = 3x2 - 4xy + 2j/2 then
Higher derivatives are defined similarly. 
For example, we have the second order
derivatives
(U)
The derivatives in (13) are sometimes denoted by fx and fy. 
In such case fx(a,b), 
fv(a,b)
denote these partial derivatives evaluated at (a, b). Similarly the derivatives in (14) are
denoted by fxx, fxv, fyx, fm respectively. The second and third results in (14) will be the same
if / has continuous partial derivatives of second order at least.
The differential of f(x, y) is defined as

where

The ideas involved in Taylor series for functions of one variable can be generalized.
For example, the Taylor series for f(x, y) about x = a, y — b can be written

LINEAR EQUATIONS AND DETERMINANTS

dinates (x,y) are found by solving (17) simultaneously. We find

Note that the denominator for x and y in (19) is the determinant consisting of the coefficients
of * and y in (17). The numerator for x is found by replacing the first column of the
denominator by the constants c\, cz on the right side of (17). Similarly the numerator for
y is found by replacing the second column of the denominator by ci, c2. This procedure is
often called Cramer's rule. In case the denominator in (19) is zero, the two lines represented
by (17) do not meet in one point but are either coincident or parallel.
The ideas are easily extended. Thus consider the equations
(21)
representing 3 planes. If they intersect in a point, the coordinates (x, y, z) of this point are
found from Cramer's rule to be
(22)
where we define the determinant of order 3 by
= 
01&2C3 + &iC2a3 + CiO2&3 — (biases + aiC2&3 + Ci62as) 
(23)
The result (23) can be remembered by using the scheme of repeating the first two columns
as follows
(24)
and taking the sums of the products of terms as indicated by the arrows marked + and —.
The determinant can also be evaluated in terms of second order determinants as follows
(**)
where it is noted that a\, b\, c\ are the elements in the first row and the corresponding second
order determinants are those obtained from the given third order determinant by removing
the row and column in which the element appears.
The general theory of determinants, of which the above results are special cases, is
considered in Chapter 15.

MAXIMA AND MINIMA
If for all x such that \x - a\ < 8 we have f(x) S /(a) [or f(x) g /(a)], we say that /(a)
is a relative maximum [or relative minimum]. For f(x) to have a relative maximum or
minimum at x = a, we must have /'(a) = 0. Then if /"(a) < 0 it is a relative maximum
while if /"(a) > 0 it is a relative minimum. Note that possible points at which f(x) has
a relative maxima or minima are obtained by solving f'(x) = 0, i.e. by finding the values
of x where the slope of the graph of f(x) is equal to zero.
Similarly f(x,y) has a relative maximum or minimum at x = a, y = b if fx(a, b) = 0,
fv(a,b) = 0. Thus possible points at which f(x,y) has relative maxima or minima are
obtained by solving simultaneously the equations
(26)
Extensions to functions of more than two variables are similar.
METHOD OF LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
Sometimes we wish to find the relative maxima or minima of f(x, y) = 0 subject to
some constraint condition </>(«, y) = 0. To do this we form the function h(x, y) = f(x, y) +
\4>(x, handset

The constant A. is called a Lagrange multiplier and the method is called the method of
Lagrange multipliers. Generalizations can be made [see Problems 1.54 and 1.150].

MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
A generalization of the integral for functions of one variable leads to the idea of
multiple integrals for functions of two or more variables. Because several ideas involved
in the theory may be new to some students, we postpone consideration of this topic to
Chapter 6.
COMPLEX NUMBERS
Complex numbers arose in order to solve polynomial equations such as x2 +1 = 0 or
x2 + x +1 = 0 which are not satisfied by real numbers. We assume that a complex number
has the form a + bi where a, b are real numbers and i, called the imaginary unit, has the
property that i2 = — 1. We define operations with complex numbers as follows.
1. Addition. 
(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
2. Subtraction. 
(a + bi) — (c + di) = (a — c) + (b — d)i
3. Multiplication. 
(a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bd& = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
4. Division.

[CHAP. 1
Note that we have used the ordinary rules of algebra except that we replace i2 by —1
wherever it occurs. The commutative, associative and distributive laws of page 1 also
apply to complex numbers. We call a and b of a + bi the real and imaginary parts respec-
tively. Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real and imaginary parts are
respectively equal.
A complex number z = x + iy can be considered as a
point P with coordinates (x,y) on a rectangular xy plane
called in this case the complex plane or Argand diagram
[Fig. 1-4]. If we construct the line from origin 0 to P and
let p be the distance OP and 
<f> the angle made by OP with
the positive x axis, we have from Fig. 1-4
(30)
and can write the complex number in so-called polar form as 
Fig. 1-4
(31)
We often call p the modulus or absolute value of z and denote it by \z\. The angle 
is
called the amplitude or argument of z abbreviated argz. We can also write
where z = x — iy is called the conjugate of z = x + iy.
If we write two complex numbers in polar form as
(32)
(34)
Also if n is any real number, we have
(35)
which is often called De Moivre's theorem. We can use this to determine roots of complex
numbers. For example if « is a positive integer,
k = Q, 1, 2, ...,n-l 
(36)
Using the series for ex, sin x, cos x on page 8, we are led to define
(37)
which are called Euler's formulas and which enable us to rewrite equations (31)-(36) in
terms of exponentials.
Many of the ideas presented in this chapter involving real numbers can be extended
to complex numbers. These ideas are developed in Chapter 13.

Assume the contrary, i.e. suppose that 
where p and q are positive integers having
no common integer factor other than 1 [in such case we say that p/q is a fraction in lowest terms}.
Squaring, 2 = p2/q2 or p2 = 2g2. Then p2 is even and so p must also be even. Thus p = 2m
where m is a positive integer. Substituting into p2 = 2<?

find 
so that q2 is even and
thus q is even, i.e. q = 2n where n is a positive integer. Since p and q are both even they have
2 as a common factor, violating our assumption that thev have no common integer factor other than

Then since f"(x) = 12a;2 - 48a; + 44, we have /"(I) = 8 > 0, /"(2) = -4 < 0, /"(3) = 8 > 0. Thus
a relative minimum of 11 occurs at x = 1, a relative maximum of 12 occurs at x = 2 and a

f(x,y) is to be made a maximum or minimum [or extremum] subject to the con-

an extremum is f(x, y, z) and the constraint condition is $(x, y, z) = 0.
(c) Illustrate the method of Lagrange multipliers by working Problem 1.53.
(a) Assume that </>(x, y) = 0 defines y as a unique function of x, i.e. y = g(«), having a continuous
derivative g'(x). 
Then we must find the maximum or minimum [extremum] of
f(x,y) =

To do this we form the function

DEFINITION OF A DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
A differential 
equation is an equation involving derivatives or differentials. The fol-
lowing are some examples of differential equations.
Example 
Example 2.
Example 3.
Example 4.
Example 5.
Equations such as those in Examples 1-4 involving only one independent variable are called
ordinary differential 
equations. Equations such as that of Example 5 with two or more
independent variables are called partial differential equations and are treated in Chapter 12.
ORDER OF A DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
An equation having a derivative of wth order but no higher is called an nth order dif-
ferential equation. In Examples 1-5 above, the orders of the differential equations are
2,1, 2,1, 2, respectively.
ARBITRARY CONSTANTS
An arbitrary constant, often denoted by a letter at the beginning of the alphabet such as
A, B, C, clf cz, etc., may assume values independently of the variables involved. For example
in y — xz + cix + c2, c\ and c2 are arbitrary constants.
The relation y = Ae~4x+B which can be written y = AeBe~*x = Ce~4x actually involves
only one arbitrary constant. We shall always assume that the minimum number of con-
stants is present, i.e. the arbitrary constants are essential.
SOLUTION OF A DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
A solution of a differential equation is a relation between the variables which is free
of derivatives and which satisfies the differential equation identically.
Example 6. y - x2 + c& + c2 is a solution of y" = 2 since by substitution we obtain the
identity 2 = 2.

A general solution of an rath order differential equation is one involving n (essential)
arbitrary constants.
Example 7. Since y = x2 + «i* + c2 has two arbitrary constants and satisfies the second order
differential equation y" - 2, it is a general solution of y" = 2.
A particular solution is a solution obtained from the general solution by assigning
specific values to the arbitrary constants.
Example 8. y = xz — 3* + 2 is a particular solution of y" = 2 and is obtained from the general
solution y = x2 + ctx + c2 by putting Cj = —3 and c2 = 2.
A singular solution is a solution which cannot be obtained from the general solution
by specifying values of the arbitrary constants.
Example 9. The general solution of y = xy'- y'2 is y = ex - c2. However, as seen by substi-
tution another solution is y = «2/4 which cannot be obtained from the general
solution for any constant c. This second solution is a singular solution. For a
relationship between the general and singular solutions see Problem 2.5.
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION OF A FAMILY OF CURVES
A general solution of an nth order differential equation has n arbitrary constants (or
parameters) and represents geometrically an n parameter family of curves. Conversely
a relation with n arbitrary constants [sometimes called a primitive] has associated with it a
differential equation of order n [of which it is a general solution] called the 
differential
equation of the family. This differential equation is obtained by differentiating the prim-
itive n times and then eliminating the n arbitrary constants among the n +1 resulting
equations. See Problems 2.6 and 2.7.
SPECIAL FIRST ORDER EQUATIONS AND SOLUTIONS
Any first order differential equation can be put into the form
(1)
and the general solution of such an equation'contains one arbitrary constant. Many special
devices are available for finding general solutions of various types of first order differential
equations. In the following table some of these types are given.

EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF SOLUTIONS
It is often important to be able to predict directly from a differential equation and
associated conditions whether a solution exists and is unique. For the case of a first
order differential equation
y' = f(x,y) 
(3)
an answer is supplied in the following
Existence and Uniqueness Theorem. 
If f(x, y) is continuous and has a continuous partial
derivative with respect to y at each point of the region R defined by \x — x0\ < 8,
\y — Vo\ < 8, then there exists in R one and only one solution to (3) which passes through
the point (x0,yn).
An immediate generalization of this theorem is possible for the nth order differential equa-
tion y
<n> = f(x,y,y',...,y<n-»).
APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Many problems of science and engineering, when formulated mathematically, lead to
boundary-value problems, i.e. differential equations and associated conditions.

ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 
[CHAP. 2
In a mathematical formulation of a physical problem, a mathematical model is chosen
which often approximates the actual situation. For example, in treating rotation of the
earth around the sun, we may consider that the sun and earth are points.
If a mathematical model and corresponding mathematical formulation leads to fairly
good agreement with that predicted by observation or experiment, then the model is good.
Otherwise a new model may have to be chosen.
SOME SPECIAL APPLICATIONS
The following table lists some special applications of an elementary nature which arise
in science and engineering.
I. MECHANICS
The basic law of mechanics or dynamics is that of Newton, i.e.
(4)
where m is the mass of the moving object, v is its velocity, t is the time and F is the net force
acting on the object. The quantity mv is often called the momentum.
If m is constant, then this equation becomes
(5)
where a is the acceleration.
On or near the earth's surface, mass m is connected with weight W by m = W/g or W - mg
where g is the acceleration due to gravity.
Various systems of units are available.
(a) C.G.S. [centimeter (cm), gram (g), second (sec)]. 
If m is in grams and a in cm/sec2, then
F is in dynes.
(b) M.K.S. [meter (m), kilogram (kg), second (sec)]. 
If m is in kilograms and a in m/sec2, then
F is in newtons (nt).
(c) F.P.S. [foot (ft), pound (Ib), second (sec)]. 
If W is in pounds a and g in ft/sec2, then F =
ma — Wa/g is in pounds.
On the earth's surface g = 32 ft/sec2 = 980 cm/sec2 — 9.8 m/sec2 approximately.
II. ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
A simple series electric circuit [Fig. 2-1] may consist of
(1) a battery or generator supplying an electromotive force or
e.m.f. (voltage or potential) of E volts,
(2) a resistor having a resistance of R ohms,
(3) an inductor having an inductance of L henries,
(4) a capacitor or condenser having a capacitance of C farads.
The current I measured in amperes is the instantaneous time
rate of change of charge Q on the condenser measured in cou-
lombs, i.e. 7 = dQ/dt. 
Fig. 2-1
From basic principles of electricity we have
Potential drop across resistor 
= IR
Potential drop across inductor 
= L dl/dt
Potential drop across capacitor = QIC
Kirchhoff's Laws.
(a) The algebraic sum of the currents flowing into a junction point is zero.
(6) The algebraic sum of the potential drops around a closed loop is zero.
For single loop circuits law (a) implies that the current is the same throughout the loop.

ORTHOGONAL TRAJECTORIES
A curve cutting each member of a one parameter family of curves at right angles is called an
orthogonal trajectory of the family. If dy/dx = F(x, y) is the differential equation of a one param-
eter family (not containing the parameter), then the differential equation for the family of
orthogonal trajectories is
IV. DEFLECTION OF BEAMS
A horizontal beam situated on the x axis of an
xy coordinate system and supported in various ways,
bends under the influence of vertical loads. The de-
flection curve of the beam, often called the elastic curve
and shown dashed in Fig. 2-2, is given by y = f(x)
where y is measured as positive downward. This curve
may be determined from the equation
(«)
where M(x) is the bending moment at x and is equal to
the algebraic sum of the moments of all forces to one
side of x, the moments being taken as positive for
forces in the positive y direction and negative otherwise.
For small deflections y' is small and the approximate equation
Ely" = M(x)
Fig. 2-2
(7)
is used. The quantity El where E is Young's modulus and / is the moment of inertia of a cross
section of the beam about its central axis, is called the flexural rigidity and is generally constant.
V. MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS
Various problems of science and engineering pertaining to temperature, heat flow, chemistry,
radioactivity, etc., can be mathematically formulated in terms of differential equations.
NUMERICAL METHODS FOR SOLVING DIFFERENTIAL 
EQUATIONS
Given the boundary-value problem
(8)
it may not be possible to obtain an exact solution. In such case various methods are
available for obtaining an approximate or numerical solution. In the following we list
several such methods.
1. Step by step or Euler method. In this method we replace the differential equation of
(8) by the approximation
so that
y(x0 + h) = y(x<>) + hf(xo,y0)
(9)
(10)
By continuing in this manner we can then find y(x<> + 2h), y(x<> + 3h), etc. We choose
h sufficiently small so as to obtain good approximations.
A modified procedure of this method can also be used. See Problem 2.45.

44 
ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 
[CHAP. 2
2. Taylor series method. By successive differentiation of the differential equation in (8)
we can find y'(x0), y"(x0), y'"(x0), 
Then the solution is given by the Taylor series
(11)
assuming that the series converges. If it does we can obtain y(x0 + h) to any desired
accuracy. See Problem 2.46.
3. Picard's method. 
By integrating the differential equation in (8) and using the bound-
ary condition, we find
(12)
Assuming the approximation yi(x) = y<>, we obtain from (12) a new approximation
(13)
Using this in (12) we obtain another approximation
(14)
Continuing in this manner we obtain a sequence of approximations y\, y*, 2/3, .... 
The
limit of this sequence, if it exists, is the required solution. However, by carrying out
the procedure a few times, good approximations can often be obtained. See Problem 2.47.
4. Runge-Kutta method. 
This method consists of computing
(15)
Then 
(16)
See Problem 2.48.
These methods can also be adapted for higher order differential equations by writing
them as several first order equations. See Problems 2.49-2.51.

Check whether each differential equation has the indicated solution. Which solutions
are general solutions?
(a) y' - x + y = 0; y = Ce~x + x - 1.
Substitute y = Ce~x + x — 1, y' = -Ce"1 + 1 in the differential equation. 
Then
y' - x + y = -Ce-* + 1 - x + Ce~x + x - 1 = 0
Hence y — Ce~x + x — 1 is a solution.
Since the number of arbitrary constants (one) equals the order of the differential equation
(one), it is a general solution.

Differentiating xzy -y3 = c we have x2y' + 2xy - 3y2yi = 0, i.e. (x2 - 3y2)y' + 2xy = 0

and so the given relation is a general solution since the order of the differential equation and
the number of arbitrary constants in the solution are both equal to 2.
Substituting 
in the differential equation, we find «3(2c)2 =
2(cx2)(2cx) or 4c2*3 = 4e2ic3. Thus v = ex2 is a solution. However, it is not a general solu-
tion since the number of arbitrary constants (one) is not equal to the order of the equation
(two).

Q'(t) = e-2«(4 cos4« - 4 sin4«) - 2e~2t(l + sin 4t + cos4t)
= e-2t(2 cos 4* - 6 sin 4t - 2)
Q"(t) = e-2t(-g sin4t - 24 cos 4t) - 2e~2«(2 cos4t - 6 sin 4* - 2)
= e-2'(4sin4t-28cos4« + 4)
Then 
Q"(t) + 4Q'(t) + 20Q(t) = e-2«(4 sin 4t - 28 cos 4t + 4)
+ 4e-2«(2 cos 4t — 6 sin 4t - 2)

= 16e-2t
Furthermore Q(0) = 2 and Q'(0) = 0. Thus the given relation is a solution to the boundary-value
problem.

y = ex — c2 represents a family of straight
lines tangent to the parabola y — x2/4. The
parabola is the envelope of the family of

The envelope of a family of curves

ing simultaneously the equations dG/dc = 0

if the beam has constant weight W per unit
length and 
(b) determine the maximum
deflection. 
Fig. 2-15
(a) The total weight of the beam is WL, so each end supports weight %WL. Let x be the distance
from the left end A of the beam. To find the bending moment M at x, consider forces to the
left of x.
(1) Force \WL at A has moment -(%WL)x.
(2) Force due to weight of beam to left of x has magnitude Wx and moment
Wx(x/Z) - $Wx*
Then the total bending moment at * is %Wx2 — \WLx. 
Thus
Ely" = %Wx*-$WLx
Solving this subject to y' = 0 at x = LIZ [from symmetry] and y = 0 at x = 0, we find
y =

This could also be obtained using conditions y — 0 at x = 0 and x — L.
(b) The maximum deflection occurs, at x = L/2 and is 5WL4/S84EI.
Note that if forces to the right of x had been considered, the bending moment would be

To obtain the entries in the second line use h — .1 and equation (10), page 43, to obtain
y(x0 + h) =

= 
value of y in first line + (.l)(slope in first line)
= 
1.0000 + (.1)(1.0000) = 1.1000
and the corresponding slope is
y' = 2(.l) + 1.1000 = 1.3000
Similarly we have
value of y in third line = 
value of y in second line + (.1) (slope in second line)
= 
1.1000 + .1(1.3000)
= 
1.2300
and 
slope in third line = 
2(.2) + 1.2300 = 
1.6300
The remainder of the entries are obtained by continuing in this manner and we find finally
2/(.5) = 1.8315.
(6) The equation is linear and has integrating factor e~x. Solving, we find y = 3ex — 2x — 2.
Then when * = .5, y = 3e-5 — 3 = 3(1.6487) — 3 = 1.9461. Better accuracy can be obtained by
using smaller values of h or proceeding as in Problem 2.45 which is a modification of the
method.
2.45. Show how to improve the accuracy of the method of Problem 2.44.
The method which we shall use is essentially the same as that of Problem 2.44 except that
we obtain improved values of y and y', which we denote by y\,y'\', y2,y21 etc., as indicated in the
table below. Success is achieved when there is very little difference between the improved values
of y [see columns headed 3/3 and 3/4 respectively in the table].
The first line in the table below is the same as the first line in the table of Problem 2.44 and
is found in exactly the same way.
Similarly the entries corresponding to y1 and y[ in line two of the table below are the same
as those in line two of the table of Problem 2.44.
We now refer only to the table given below. As seen from this table, the slopes corre-
sponding to * = .0 and x = .1 are 1.0000 and 1.3000 respectively. 
Then the average [mean]
slope is ¿(1.0000 +1.3000) = 1.1500. Using this modified slope, we find for the corresponding value
°f y 
2/2 = 1.0000 + .1(1.1500) = 1.1150 
(1)
The slope corresponding to this value of y is given by
y'2 = 2(.l) + 1.1150 = 1.3150 
(2)
using the given differential equation.
From the improved slope (2) we now obtain an improved average slope
¿(1.0000 + 1.3150) = 1.1575 
(S)
and from this an improved value of y given by
ya = 1.0000 + (.1)(1.1575) = 1.1158 
(¿)
which in turn gives an improved slope equal to
ya = 2(.l) + 1.1158 = 1.3158 
(5)
The improved average slope using (5) is then
¿(1.0000 + 1.3158) = 1.1579
and so 
i/4 = 1.0000 + (.1)(1.1579) = 1.1158 
(6)
Since this agrees with (4), the process ends.
We now use yt = 1.1158 and y'z = 1.3158 to obtain the entries in the third line. Thus
yl (line 3) = 1.1158 + (.1)(1.3158) = 1.2474
and 
y[ (line 3) = 2(.2) + 1.2474 = 
1.6474

Proceeding in this manner we find the successive approximations
Then a third approximation is

Putting x = .5 in this last approximation, we find
3/6(.5) = 1 + .5 + .375 + .0625 + .0078 + .0008 = 1.9461
2.48. Solve Problem 2.44 by the Runge-Kutta method.
Using h = .5, x0 = 0, y0 — 1, f(x, y) = Zx + y in the equations on page 44,
fcj = .5[2(0) + 1] = .5
fc2 = .5[2(.25) + 1.25] = .875
ka = .5[2(.25) + 1.4375] = .96875
fc4 = .5[2(.5) + 1.9675] = 1.48375
Then 
y(.5) = 1 + J(.5 + 1.750 + 1.9375 + 1.48375) = 1.9452
Better approximations can be obtained by using two or more applications of the method with
smaller values of h.
2.49. (a) Show how to solve numerically the system of equations
dyldx = f(x,y,v), 
dv/dx = g(x,y,v); 
y(x0) — i/o, 
v(x0) = Vo
by the Runge-Kutta method.
(b) Use (a) to show how to solve numerically
(a) Using the results on page 44, we write
so that
(6) The equation dïy/dx2 = g(x, y, dy/dx) 
is equivalent to the system
dyldx = v, 
dv/dx = g(x,y,v)
and comparing with the equations of (a) we have 
f ( x , y, v) = v. Then the expression for
y(x0 + h) can be written in terms of Z1( 12, /3 as
2.50. If 
f 2y = x; y(Q) = 1, y'(Q) use Problem 2.49 to find an approximate
value of y(.5).
The differential equation is equivalent to the system
dy/dx = v, 
dv/dx = x — 2y + 3v
and with the notation of Problem 2.49(6) we have g(x, y,v) — x — 2y + Sv, x0 — 0, y0 = 1, V0 — 0.
Thus if h = .5 we have from Problem 2.49(a),
li = .5(-2) = -1, 
Z2 = .5(-3.25) = -1.625,

GENERAL LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION OF ORDER n
The general linear differential equation of order n has the form
(1)
A differential equation which cannot be written in this form is called nonlinear.
Example 1. 
= sin a; is a second order linear equation.
Example 2 . = 
e~x i s a second order nonlinear equation.
\ 
/
If R(x), the right side of (J), is replaced by zero the resulting equation is called the com-
plementary, reduced or homogeneous equation. If R(x) ¥= 0, the equation is called the
complete or nonhomogeneous equation.
Example 3. If 
= sin» is the complete equation, then 
-
Zxy = 0 is the corresponding complementary, reduced or homogeneous equation.
If ao(x), ai(x), .. .,an(x) are all constants, (1) is said to have constant coefficients, 
otherwise
it is said to have variable coefficients.
EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS THEOREM
If a0(x), ai(x), ..., an(x) and R(x) are continuous in the interval \x — Xo\ < 8 and
a<>(x) ¥= 0, then there exists one and only one solution to (Í) which satisfies the conditions

It is sometimes convenient to adopt the notation Dy, D2y, ..., Dny to denote
The symbols D, D2, ... are called differential 
operators and have prop-
erties analogous to those of algebraic quantities. Using this notation, we shall agree to
write (1) as
[a»(x)D« + ai(x)D»-i + • • • + a*-i(x)D + an(x)]y = R(x) 
(3)
or briefly 
<j)(D)y = R(x)
where <t>(D) = a0(x)Dn + a1(x)Dn~1 + • • • + o»-i(a;)Z> + o»(a;) is called an operator polynomial
in D.

LINEAR OPERATORS
An operator L is called a linear operator if for any constants A, B and functions u, v to
which L can be applied, we have
L(Au + Bv) = AL(u)+BL(v)
The operators D,D2,... and <j>(D) are linear operators [see Problem 3.3].
FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM ON LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
In order to find the general solution of
4>(D)y = R(x) 
(4)
where R(x) ¥* 0, let Yc(x) be the general solution of the complementary reduced or homo-
geneous equation 
my = Q 
(5)
We often refer to Yc(x) as the complementary or homogeneous solution. Then we have the
following important theorem, sometimes referred to as the superposition principle or
theorem.
Theorem 3-1. The general solution of (4) is obtained by adding the complementary solu-
tion Yc(x) to a particular solution Yp(x) of (4), i.e.
y = Yc(x) + Yp(x)
Example 5. The general solution of (Z>
2 — 3D + 2)y = 0 is y - c^* + C2e2x and a particular
solution of (D2 — 3D + 2)y = 4x2 is 2x2 + 6x + 1. Then the general solution of
(Tft - 3D + 2)y = 4a;2 is y = c^* + c2e*x + Zx2 + 6x + 1.
Because of this theorem it is clear that we shall have to consider separately the problems
of finding general solutions of homogeneous equations and particular solutions of nonhomo-
geneous equations.
LINEAR DEPENDENCE AND WRONSKIANS
A set of n functions yi(x), yz(x), ..., yn(x) is said to be linearly dependent over an interval
if there exist n constants Ci, cz, ..., cn, not all zero, such that
c\yi(x) + c2y2(x) + • • • + cnyn(x) 
= 
0
identically over the interval. 
Otherwise the set of functions is said to be linearly
independent.
Example 6. 2eSx, 5eSx, e~4x are linearly dependent over any interval since we can find constants
ci> "2. cs n°t all zero such that c^Ze3*) + c2(5e3x) + cs(e~*x) = 0 identically; for in-
stance, Cj = —5, c2 = 2, c3 = 0.
Example 7. ex and xex are linearly independent since Cje* + c2xex = 0 identically if and only if
«i = 0, C2 = 0.
Theorem 3-2. The set of functions 3/1(0;), y2(x), ..., yn(x) [assumed differentiate] is linearly
independent on an interval if and only if the determinant

This last theorem is important in connection with solutions of the homogeneous or
reduced equation as seen in the following
Theorem 3-3. 
[Superposition Principle]. If yi(x),y2(x), ...,yn(x) are n linearly inde-
pendent solutions of the wth order linear equation <j>(D)y = 0, then
y 
= 
ciyi(x) + c2y2(x) + • •• + cnyn(x)
where ci, c2, ...,cn are n arbitrary constants, is the general solution of
4>(D)y = 0.
SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS WITH CONSTANT COEFFICIENTS
The remarks made so far have applied to the general equation (1). Particular sim-
plifications occur when the equation has constant coefficients and we now turn to this case.
Two general procedures are available in this case, namely those which do not involve
operator techniques and those which do. For each case methods exist for finding com-
plementary and particular solutions and use is then made of the fundamental Theorem 3-1.
NON-OPERATOR TECHNIQUES
I. THE COMPLEMENTARY OR HOMOGENEOUS SOLUTION
Let y = emx, m = constant, in (a0Dn + aiDn~l + • • • +an)y = 0 to obtain
a0mn + aim"-1 H 
+ a« = 0 
(6)
which is called the auxiliary equation or characteristic equation. This can be factored
m ° 
a0(w - mi)(m - m2) • • • (m - mn) - 0 
(7)
which has roots mi, m2, ..., mn. Three cases must be considered.
Case 1. Roots all real and distinct.
Then emix, em*x, ..., em"x are n linearly independent solutions so that by Theorem 3-3
the required solution is
y = ciemix + c2em*x + • • • + cnem«x 
(8)
Case 2. Some roots are complex.
If ao, 01, ..., an are real, then when a + bi is a root of (6) so also is a — bi [where
a, b are real]. Then a solution corresponding to the roots a + bi and a — bi is
y = eax(ci cos bx + c2 sin bx) 
(9)
where use is made of Euler's formula ein — cos u + c sin u.
Case 3. Some roots are repeated.
If mi is a root of multiplicity k, then a solution is given by
y = (GI + c2x + c3x2 + • • • + ckxk~l)em^x 
(10)
II. THE PARTICULAR SOLUTION
Two important methods for finding a particular solution of 
4>(D)y = R(x) 
are
available.
1. Method of Undetermined Coefficients.
In this method we assume a trial solution containing unknown constants (indi-
cated by a, b, c, ...) which are to be determined by substitution in the given equation.
The trial solution to be assumed in each case depends on the special form of R(x)
and is shown in the following table. In each case /, g, p, q are given constants and
k is a given positive integer.

The above method holds in case no term in the assumed trial solution appears in
the complementary solution. If any term of the assumed trial solution does appear
in the complementary solution, we must multiply this trial solution by the smallest
positive integral power of x which is large enough so that none of the terms which
are then present appear in the complementary solution.
2. Method of Variation of Parameters.
Let the complementary solution of $(D)y = R(x) be
y = ciyi(x) + c2y2(x) + • • • + cnyn(x)
Replace the arbitrary constants Ci, c2, ..., en by functions Ki(x), K^x),..., Kn(x)
and seek to determine these so that y = K\y\ + Kzyz + • • • + Knyn is a solution of
<t>(D)y = R(x). Since, to determine these n functions, we must impose n restrictions
on them and since one of these is that the differential equation be satisfied, it follows
that the remaining n -1 may be taken at will. The conditions which lead to the
greatest simplicity are given by the equations
K'^ + K'^+.-.+K'^ = 0
% + %+•••+*X = o
tf><"-2) + K'2y?-» + • • • + £><,»-» = 0
#><«-» + #><»-» + • • • + Kfâ-» 
= R(x)/a0
(11)
where the last equation represents the condition that the given differential equa-
tion be satisfied.
Since the determinant of the above system of equations is the Wronskian of
2/1,2/2, ..., 2/n which is supposed to be different from zero, the equations can be solved
for K(,Kz, ...,K'n. From these Ki,Kz, .. .,Kn can be found by integration leading
to the required solution. The method is applicable whenever the complementary
solution can be found, including cases where oo,..., a» are not constants.

CHAP. 3]
LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

OPERATOR TECHNIQUES
When Oo, ai, ..., an are constants, the equation <j>(D)y = R(x) can be written in factored
formas
(12)
ao(D - mi)(D - m2) • • • (D — mn)y = R(x)
where mi, ...,mn are constants and where the order of the factors (D - mi), ..., (D — mn)
is immaterial. This is not true if 00,0,1,.. .,an are not constants [see Problem 3.2]. The
constants mi, ...,mn are the same as the roots of the auxiliary equation (6) or (7), and so
the complementary solution can be written as before. To obtain particular solutions, the
following operator methods will be found useful.
1. Method of Reduction of Order.
Let ao(D-m2) • • • (D-mJy = Yi. Then (12) becomes (D-mi)Yi = R(x) which
can be solved for YI. Then let a<>(D -ms) ••• (D- mn)y = Yz so that (D - m2)Yz = Yi
which can be solved for Y2. By continuing in this manner, y can be obtained. This
method yields the general solution if all arbitrary constants are kept, while if arbitrary
constants are omitted it yields a particular solution.
2. Method of Inverse Operators.
Let -Tn\ R(x) be defined as a particular solution yp such that <¡>(D)yp = R(x). We
<p\
u>
call 1/£(D) an inverse operator. By reference to the entries in the following table, the
labor involved in finding particular solutions of <¡>(D)y = R(x) is often diminished con-
siderably. In using these we often employ the theorem that

LINEAR EQUATIONS WITH VARIABLE COEFFICIENTS
Various methods are available for solving differential equations of the form (1) where
«to, 0,1,..., On are not constants. In the following we list a few important methods.
I. 
MISCELLANEOUS TRANSFORMATIONS OF VARIABLES
1. Cauchy or Euler Equation. This equation has the form
(b0xnDn + bixn-lDn~l + • • • + bn-!xD + bn)y = R(x)
where 60, &i,..., bn are constants. 
It can be solved by letting x — e* and using
the results
xD = Dt, 
x2D2 = Dt(Dt-l), 
x3D* = Dt(Dt-l)(Dt-2), ...
where Dt = d/dt, thus reducing the equation to one with constant coefficients.
The case where R(x) = 0 can be solved by letting y = x" and determining the
constant p.
2. Case where one solution is known. If one solution y = Y(x) of 4>(D)y - R(x)
is known, then the substitution y = vY(x) transforms the differential equation
into one of order n -1 in v'. If n - 2, the equation can then be solved exactly.
See Problem 3.34.
3. Reduction to canonical form. The general second order linear equation
y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = r(x) 
(IS)
can be transformed into the canonical form
v" + f(x)v = g(x)

where

Thus if (14) can be solved, so can (13). See Problems 3.35 and 3.36.
II. EXACT EQUATIONS
The equation [ao(x)Dn + ai(x)Dn-1 + ••• + an(x)]y = R(x) is called exact if
a0(x)D» + ai(iK)Z)»-1 + • • • + an(x) 
= D[p0(x)Dn-1 + ••• + pn-i(x)}
For example, [oo(x)D2 + ai(x)D + a2(x)]y = R(x) is exact if and only if a¿' + aí +
a2 = 0 identically. See Problems 3.37 and 3.38.
III. VARIATION OF PARAMETERS
This method, identical to that on page 74, can be used when the complementary
solution is known.
IV. OPERATOR FACTORIZATION
If <f>(D) can be factored into factors each having the form p(x)D + q(x), then the
method of reduction of order (page 75) can be used. See Problem 3.39.
V. SERIES METHODS
The equation at>(x)y" + ai(x)y' + a2(x)y = 0 where a<>, oi, o2 are polynomials, can
often be solved by assuming that
y = xe(c0 + dx + C2X2+•••) = 
CkX"** 
where ck = 0, k < 0 
(17)
where fi and Ck are constants. 
Substituting (17) into the differential equation leads
to an equation for /?, called the indicial equation, and equations for the constants
Co, ci, ... in the form of a recursion formula. By solving for p and the other constants,
a series solution can often be obtained. The series is called a Frobenius series and the
method is often called the method of Frobenius. See Problem 3.40.
SIMULTANEOUS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
A system of differential equations with two or more dependent variables and one
independent variable can be solved by eliminating all but one of the dependent variables,
thus obtaining a single ordinary differential equation. Solutions obtained should be checked
by substitution into the original differential equations to insure that the proper number of
arbitrary constants are present. See Problem 3.41.
APPLICATIONS
Problems in mechanics, electricity and other fields of science and engineering often lead
to linear differential equations and can be solved by the above methods. See Problems
3.42-3.47.

Prove that if the Wronskian of the set of functions y\,... yn is different from zero

the Wronskian is different from zero.
Suppose the contrary, i.e. the Wronskian is zero for a particular value x0 of the interval.

If J/i(*), • • ->yn(x) are solutions of <t>(D)y = 0, it follows from Problem 4 that (2) is also a solution
of <f>(D)y — 0 which as is seen from equations (1) satisfies the conditions y(x0) — 0, y'(x0) = 0, ...,
j/Cn-i)(a;0) = 0. But y = 0 satisfies <f>(D)y = 0 and these same conditions. Thus by the uniqueness
theorem of page 41 it follows that the only solution is y = 0, i.e.
Ci3/i(*) + • • • + cnyn(x) = 0

3.16. Solve y" - 8y' + 16y = 0.
The equation can be written (D2 — 8D + 16)y = 0 or (D — 4)2y = 0. The auxiliary equation
(m — I)2 = 0 has roots m = 4,4 so that e4*, e4x are solutions corresponding to these repeated roots.
However, they are clearly not linearly independent and so we cannot say that y = Cje4x + C2e4j: is
the general solution, since it can be written (cj + c2)e41 = ce41 which involves only one arbitrary
constant. There are two methods which can be used to get the general solution.
Method 1.
Write the given equation as (D - 4)(I> - 4)j/ = 0 and let (D — 4)y = Yl so that (D - a)Y1 - 0
and so Yl = A^. Thus (D — 4)y = Aje4*. Solving, we find y = (et + ctffie*1.
This method, called the method of reduction of order, illustrates a general procedure for
repeated roots. Using it we would find, for example, that if 4 were a triple repeated root, the
general solution would be y — (Cj + e2x + C3x2)e*x.

To obtain a particular solution assume corresponding to 8*2 and 12e~x the trial solutions
ax2 + bx + c and de~x respectively, since none of these terms are present in the complementary

Equating corresponding coefficients on both sides of the equation,
4a = 8, 
4a + 46 = 0, 
2a + 26 + 4c = 0, 
3d = 12
Then a = 2, 6 = —2, c = 0, d = 4 and the particular solution is 2x2 — 2x + 4e~x. Thus the

3.19. Solve Problem 3.18 if the term 10 sin Bx is added to the right side.
Corresponding to the additional term 10 sin Sx we assume the additional trial solution
h cos Sx + k sin 3» which does not appear in the complementary solution.

the equation (D2 + 2D + i)y = 10 sin Sx,
(6fc - 5h) cos Sx - (5k + 6h) sin Sx -

The complementary solution is c1 cos 2x + c2 sin 2x.
For a particular solution we would normally assume a trial solution a cos 2x + b sin 2x. How-
ever, since the ternis appear in the complementary solution, we multiply by x to obtain the trial
solution x(a cos 2x + 6 sin 2x). Then substituting in the given equation,
—4a cos 2x — 46 sin 2x 
— 8 sin 2x
so that 4o = 0, —46 = 8 and o = 0, 6 = —2. 
Then the required general solution is
y = c1 cos 2x + c2 sin 2x — 2x sin 2x
3.21. 
Solve 
(D5 - 3D4 + 3D3 - D2)y = x2 + 2x + Se*.
The auxiliary equation is

m2(m — I)3 = 0. 
Thus 
m —
0, 0, 1, 1, 1 and the complementary solution is
Cj + c2x + (c3 + c4x + C5x2)ex
Corresponding to the polynomial x2 + 2x, we would normally assume a trial solution ax2 + bx + c.
However, some of these terms appear in the complementary solution. Multiplying by x, the trial
solution would be x(ax2 + bx + c) = ax3 + bx2 + ex, but one of these terms is still in the com-
plementary solution. Finally multiplying by x again to obtain ax4 + bx3 + ex2, we see that this
has no term in the complementary solution and so is the needed trial solution.
Similarly, corresponding to Sex we would normally assume a trial solution dex. 
But since
this term as well as dxex and dx2ex are in the complementary solution, we must use as trial solution
dx3ex.
Thus the assumed trial solution is ax* + bx3 + ex2 + dx3ex. 
Substituting this in the given
equation, we find

y = Kl cos x + K2 sin x where Klt K2 are suitable functions of x to be determined. Differentiation
yields
y' 
= 
—K-1 sin x + K2 cos x + Kl cos x + K2 sin x 
(1)
Since there are two functions KltK2, we must arrive at two conditions for determining them.
However, one of these conditions is that the differential equation must be satisfied. Thus we are at
liberty to impose arbitrarily the second condition. We choose this condition to be the one which
simplifies (1) most, namely
K( cos x + K2 sin x = 0 
(2)
Then (1) becomes 
y' 
= —K1 sin x + K2 cos x
Differentiating again
y" 
= —Kl cos x — K2 sin x — K1 sin x + K2 cos x
Thus 
y" + y = 
—K[ sin x + K2 cos * = 
sec a; 
(3)
From the two equations
K[ cos x + K2 sin x = 0
—K1 sin x + K2 cos x = sec x
we find K[ = 1, K2 = —tan x. 
Thus by integrating, K1 = x + c¡, K2 = —In sec x + c2 and the

KI + K2 cos 2x + K's sin 2x = 0
0 - 2K'2 sin 2x + 2K'Z cos 2x = 0
0 - 4K2 cos 2x - 4K'3 sin 2x = 4 cot 2œ
Solving this system, we find K( = cot 2x, K2 — —cos2 2x/sin 2a;, K's — —cos 2x so that
From this we find the general solution

Let fc = 0. Then since c_2 = 0, (1) becomes (4/82 — I)c0 = 0 which is called the indicial equation.

Note that for this equation it is not necessary to consider Case 2, p = 1/2 since we have
already obtained the required solution. Note also that if we had considered ft — 1/2 first, we
would not have obtained the general solution. This is typical in general when the roots of the
indicial equation differ by any integer except zero. In other equations both cases would have to
be considered, each leading to a series solution. The general solution would then be obtained

APPLICATIONS
3.42. A particle P of mass 2 (gm) moves on the x axis attracted toward origin O with a
force numerically equal to Sx. If it is initially at rest at x = 10 (cm), find its posi-
tion at any later time assuming (a) no other forces act, (&) a damping force numeri-
cally equal to 8 times the instantaneous velocity acts.
(a) Choose the positive direction to the right [Fig. 3-1]. When
x > 0, the net force is to the left [i.e. is negative] and so
is —8*. When x < 0, the net force is to the right [i.e. is
positive] and so is also —8». Thus by Newton's law,

Since x - 10, dx/dt = 0 at í = 0, we find x = 10 cos 2f.
The graph of the motion is shown in Fig. 3-2. The amplitude [maximum displacement from
0] is 10 (cm). The period [time for a complete cycle] is ir (sec). The frequency [number of cycles
per second] is 1/n- (cycles per second). The motion is often called simple harmonic motion.

Since x = 10, dx/dt = 0 when t = 0,

Assuming no external forces, find the position of the weight at any time if initially
the weight is (a) pulled down 2 inches and released, (6) pulled down 3 inches and
given an initial velocity of 2 ft/sec downward. Find the period and amplitude in
each case.
Let A and B [Fig. 3-4] represent the position of the end of the
spring before and after the weight W is put on. B is called the
equilibrium position. Call y the displacement of W at any position C
from the equilibrium position. Assume that y is positive in the down-
ward direction.
By Hooke's law, 20 lb stretches the spring .5 ft, 40 lb stretches it
1 ft and so 40(.5 + y) lb stretches it (.5 + y) ft. Thus when W is at C,
the tension in the spring is 40(.5 + y) lb.

DEFINITION OF A LAPLACE TRANSFORM
The Laplace transform of a function /(£) is defined as
(1)
and is said to exist or not according as the integral in (1) exists [converges] or does not exist
[diverges]. In this chapter we assume that s is real. Later [Chapter 14] we shall find it
convenient to take s as complex.
Often in practice there will be a real number s0 such that the integral (1) exists for
s > so and does not exist for s a s0. The set of values s > so for which (1) exists is called
the range of convergence or existence of X? {/(*)}• It may happen, however, that (1) does
not exist for any value of s [see Problem 4.50].
The symbol ^ in (1) is called the Laplace transform operator. We can show that =C is a
linear operator, i.e.
•C {ci/i(t) + c2/2(f)} = ci.C {/i(i)} + C2.Ç {/i(*)} 
(*)
LAPLACE TRANSFORMS OF SOME ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS
In the following table we give Laplace transforms of some special elementary functions

range of existence since in most instances it can easily be supplied when needed.

A study of this function is provided in Chapter 9. For our present purposes, however, we
need only the following properties:

The first is called a recursion formula for the gamma function. Note that if p is any posi-
tive integer n then r(« +1) = n\, thus explaining the relationship of entries 2 and 3 of the
table.
SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR EXISTENCE OF LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
In order to be able to state sufficient conditions on f(t) under which we can guarantee
the existence of £ {/(i)}, we introduce the concepts of piecewise continuity and exponential
order as follows.
1. Piecewise continuity. A function f(t) is said
to be piecewise continuous in an interval if
(i) the interval can be divided into a finite
number of subintervals in each of which f(t)
is continuous and (ii) the limits of /(í) as t
approaches the endpoints of each subinterval
are finite. Another way of stating this is to
say that a piecewise continuous function is one
that has only a finite number of finite dis-
continuities. An example of a piecewise con-
tinuous function is shown in Fig. 4-1. 
Fig. 4-1
2. Exponential order. 
A function f(t) is said to be of exponential order for t > T if we
can find constants M and « such that |/(i)| a Meat for t > T.
Using these we have the following theorem,
Theorem 4-1. 
If f(t) is piecewise continuous in every finite interval 0 ë t ë T and is of
exponential order for t > T, then ^ {/(i)} exists for s > a.
It should be emphasized that these conditions are only sufficient [and not necessary],
i.e. if the conditions are not satisfied =C {/(i)} may still exist. For example, <£ {*~1/2} exists
even though i~1/2 is not piecewise continuous in 0 a t ë T.
An interesting theorem which is related to Theorem 4-1 is the following
Theorem 4-2. If /(i) satisfies the conditions of Theorem 4-1, then
It follows that if lim F(s) •/= 0, then f(t) cannot satisfy the conditions of
Theorem 4-1.
INVERSE LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
If £ (f(t)} = F(s), then we call /(i) the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) and write
XT' (F(s)} = f(t).
Example 1. Since •€{*}=-=, we have ^
-
1 = t.

LAPLACE TRANSFORMS 
[CHAP. 4
While it is clear that whenever a Laplace transform exists it is unique, the same is not
true for an inverse Laplace transform.
Example 2. If 
/(i) = 
•< 
_ 
we can show that ^ {/(i)} = 1/s2- However, this func-
(JLO 
t — 2
tion f(t) differs from that of Example 1 at t — 2 although both have the same
Laplace transform. It follows that .C""1 (1/s2) can represent two (or more) different
functions.
We can show that if two functions have the same Laplace transform, then they cannot
differ from each other on any interval of positive length no matter how small. This is
sometimes called Lerch's theorem. The theorem implies that if two functions have the
same Laplace transform, then they are for all practical purposes the same and so in
practice we can take the inverse Laplace transform as essentially unique. In particular if
two continuous functions have the same Laplace transform, they must be identical.
The symbol jC_~
l is called the inverse Laplace transform operator and is a linear
operator, i.e.
JTl(*Fi(8) + C2F2(s)} = d/i(í) + c2/2(í)
LAPLACE TRANSFORMS OF DERIVATIVES
We shall find that Laplace transforms provide useful means for solving linear dif-
ferential equations. For this reason it will be necessary for us to find Laplace transforms
q£ derivatives. The following theorems are fundamental.
Theorem 4-3. Let /(i) be continuous and have a piecewise continuous derivative /'(i) in
every finite interval O á í a T. Suppose also that /(i) is of exponential
order for t > T. Then
•C {/'(«)} = «^ {/(«)}-/(O)
This can be extended as follows.
Theorem 4-4. 
Let f(t) be such that /<n~°(i) is continuous and /(n)(£) piecewise continuous
in every finite interval 0 a t a T. Suppose also that f(t),f'(t),...,/<"-"(*)
are of exponential order for t > T. Then
•C {/°°(*)} = sn=C {/(«)} - *"-V(0) - s"-2/'(0) 
/<»-»(0)
THE UNIT STEP FUNCTION
The unit step function, also called Heaviside's
unit step function, is defined as
fO 
t<a
1f(i-a) 
= 
1\l t>a
and is shown graphically in Fig. 4-2.
It is possible to express various discontinuous
functions in terms of the unit step function.

We can show [Problem 4.17] that the Laplace transform of the unit step function is

SOME SPECIAL THEOREMS ON LAPLACE TRANSFORMS

PARTIAL FRACTIONS
Although the above theorems are often useful in finding inverse Laplace transforms,
perhaps the most important single elementary method for our purposes is the method of
partial fractions. This is because in many problems which we shall encounter it will be
necessary to find the inverse of P(s)/Q(s) where P(s) and Q(s) are polynomials and the
degree of Q(s) is larger than that of P(s). For illustrations of the method see Problems
4.39-4.41.
SOLUTIONS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS BY LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
The method of Laplace transforms is particularly useful for solving linear differential
equations with constant coefficients and associated initial conditions. To accomplish this
we take the Laplace transform of the given differential equation [or equations in the case
of a system], making use of the initial conditions. This leads to an algebraic equation
[or system of algebraic equations] in the Laplace transform of the required solution. By
solving for this Laplace transform and then taking the inverse, the required solution is
obtained. For illustrations see Problems 4.42-4.44.
APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICAL PROBLEMS
Since formulation of many physical problems leads to linear differential equations
with initial conditions, the Laplace transform method is particularly suited for obtaining
their solutions. For applications to various fields see Problems 4.45-4.47.
LAPLACE INVERSION FORMULAS
There exists a direct method for finding inverse Laplace transforms, called the complex
inversion formula. This makes use of the theory of complex variables and is considered
in Chapter 14.

VECTORS AND SCALARS
There are quantities in physics characterized by both
magnitude and direction, such as displacement, velocity,
force and acceleration. To describe such quantities, we
introduce the concept of a vector as a directed line segment
PQ from one point P called the initial point to another point
Q called the terminal point. We denote vectors by bold
faced letters or letters with an arrow over them. Thus PQ
-»
is denoted by A or A as in Fig. 5-1. The magnitude or
Fig. 5-1
length of the vector is then denoted by \PQ\, PQ, |A| or |A|.
Other quantities in physics are characterized by magnitude only, such as mass, length
and temperature. 
Such quantities are often called scalars to distinguish them from
vectors, but it must be emphasized that apart from units such as feet, degrees, etc.,
they are nothing more than real numbers. We can thus denote them by ordinary letters
as usual.
VECTOR ALGEBRA
The operations of addition, subtraction and multiplica-
tion familiar in the algebra of numbers are, with suitable
definition, capable of extension to an algebra of vectors.
The following definitions are fundamental.
1.
2.
Two vectors A and B are equal if they have the
same magnitude and direction regardless of their
initial points. Thus A = B in Fig. 5-1 above.
A vector having direction opposite to that of vector
A but with the same magnitude is denoted by —A
[see Fig. 5-2]. 
Fig.5_2
3. The sum or resultant of vectors A and B of Fig. 5-3(a) below is a vector C formed
by placing the initial point of B on the terminal point of A and joining the
initial point of A to the terminal point of B [see Fig. 5-3(&) below]. The sum C
is written C = A + B. The definition here is equivalent to the parallelogram law
for vector addition as indicated in Fig. 5-3(c) below.

Extensions to sums of more than two vectors are immediate. For example,
Fig. 5-4 below shows how to obtain the sum or resultant E of the vectors
A, B, C and D.
Pig. 5-4
4. The difference 
of vectors A and B, represented by A —B, is that vector C which
added to B gives A. Equivalently, A —B may be defined as A + (—B). If A = B,
then A — B is defined as the null or zero vector and is represented by the symbol 0.
This has a magnitude of zero but its direction is not defined.
5. Multiplication of a vector A by a scalar m produces a vector raA with magni-
tude m\ times the magnitude of A and direction the same as or opposite to that
of A according as m is positive or negative. If m = 0, mA = 0, the null vector.
LAWS OF VECTOR ALGEBRA
If A, B and C are vectors, and m and n are scalars, then
1. A + B = B + A
2. A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C
3. 
m(nA.) = (mn)A — n(mA)
4. (ra + w)A = mA + «A
5. m(A + B) = mA + mB

Associative Law for Addition

Distributive Law
Note that in these laws only multiplication of a vector by one or more scalars is
defined. On pages 123 and 124 we define products of vectors.
UNIT VECTORS
Unit vectors are vectors having unit length. If A is any vector with length A > 0,
then A/A is a unit vector, denoted by a, having the same direction as A. Then A = Aa.
RECTANGULAR UNIT VECTORS
The rectangular unit vectors i, j and k are unit vec-
tors having the direction of the positive x, y and z axes
of a rectangular coordinate system [see Fig. 5-5]. We use
right-handed rectangular coordinate systems unless other-
wise specified. Such systems derive their name from the
fact that a right threaded screw rotated through 90° from
Ox to Oy will advance in the positive z direction. In general,
Fig. 5-5

CHAP. 5]
VECTOR ANALYSIS
123
three vectors A, B and C which have coincident initial points and are not coplanar are said
to form a right-handed system or dextral system if a right threaded screw rotated through
an angle less than 180° from A to B will advance in the direction C [see Fig. 5-6 below].
Pig. 5-6
Fig. 5-7
COMPONENTS OF A VECTOR
Any vector A in 3 dimensions can be represented with initial point at the origin O
of a rectangular coordinate system [see Fig. 5-7 above]. Let (Ai, A2, A3) be the rectangular
coordinates of the terminal point of vector A with initial point at O. The vectors Aii,
A2j and Ask are called the rectangular component vectors, or simply component vectors,
of A in the x, y and z directions respectively. A.\, A2 and A3 are called the rectangular
components, or simply components, of A in the x, y and z directions respectively.
The sum or resultant of Aii, A2j and Ask is the vector A, so that we can write
A = Aii + A2j + Aak 
(1)
The magnitude of A is
In particular, the position vector or radius vector i from O to the point (x,y,z) is
written
T = xi + yj + zk 
(3)
and has magnitude
DOT OR SCALAR PRODUCT
The dot or scalar product of two vectors A and B, denoted by A • B (read A dot B)
is denned as the product of the magnitudes of A and B and the cosine of the angle
between them. In symbols,
A- B = AB cos 0, 
O a 0 ^TT

Note that A • B is a scalar and not a vector.

3. m(A'B) = (mA)-B = A-(wB) = (A'B)m,

B-B = Bz = B\ + Bl+Bl
6. If A • B = 0 and A and B are not null vectors, then A and B are perpendicular.
CROSS OR VECTOR PRODUCT
The cross or vector product of A and B is a vector C = A x B (read A cross B).
The magnitude of A x B is defined as the product of the magnitudes of A and B and the
sine of the angle between them. The direction of the vector C = A x B is perpendicular
to the plane of A and B and such that A, B and C form a right-handed system.

Dot and cross multiplication of three vectors A, B and C may produce meaningful
products of the form (A-B)C, A- (B x C) and A x (B x C). The following laws are valid:

(A • B)C ¥= A(B'C) in general

The product A • (B x C) is sometimes called the scalar triple product or box product
and may be denoted by [ABC]. 
The product Ax(BxC) is called the vector triple
product.

CHAP. 5] 
VECTOR ANALYSIS 
125
In A • (B x C) parentheses are sometimes omitted and we write A • B x C. However,
parentheses must be used in Ax(BxC) (see Problem 5.25). 
Note that A-(BxC) =
(A x B) • C. This is often expressed by stating that in a scalar triple product the dot and
the cross can be interchanged without affecting the result [see Problem 5.22].
VECTOR FUNCTIONS
If corresponding to each value of a scalar u we associate a vector A, then A is called
a function of u denoted by A(u). 
In three dimensions we can write A(u) = Ai(u)i +
Aa(u)j + As(u)k.
The function concept is easily extended. Thus if to each point (x,y,z) there cor-
responds a vector A, then A is a function of (x, y, z), indicated by A(x, y, z) = A\(x, y, z)i +
A2(x, y, z)j + Aa(x, y, z)k.
We sometimes say that a vector function A(x, y, z) defines a vector field since it associ-
ates a vector with each point of a region. Similarly $(x, y, z) defines a scalar field since it
associates a scalar with each point of a region.
LIMITS, CONTINUITY AND DERIVATIVES OF VECTOR FUNCTIONS
Limits, continuity and derivatives of vector functions follow rules similar to those
for scalar functions already considered. 
The following statements show the analogy
which exists.
1. The vector function A(u) is said to be continuous at MO if given any positive num-
ber e, we can find some positive number 8 such that \A(u) — A(uo)\ < £ whenever
\u-uo < S. This is equivalent to the statement lim A(u) — A(uo).
2. The derivative of A(u) is defined as
(7)
provided this limit exists. In case A(u) = Ai(u)i + A2(u)j + A3(w)k; then
Higher derivatives such as d2A/du2, etc., can be similarly defined.
3. If A(x, y, z) = Ai(x, y, z)i + A2(x, y, z)j + A3(x, y, z)k, then
is the differential of A.
4. Derivatives of products obey rules similar to those for scalar functions. However,
when cross products are involved the order may be important. Some examples are:

GEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION OF A VECTOR DERIVATIVE
If r is the vector joining the origin O of a
coordinate system and the point (x,y,z), then
specification of the vector function r(u) defines
x, y and z as functions of u. As u changes, the
terminal point of r describes a space curve
(see 
Fig. 5-8) having parametric equations
x - x(u), y = y(u), z = z(u). If the parameter u
is the arc length s measured from some fixed
point on the curve, then

Then if <t>(x, y, z) and A(x, y, z) have continuous first partial derivatives in a region (a condi-

A point P in Fig. 5-9 can then be defined not only
by rectangular coordinates (x,y,z) but by coordi-
nates (ui,uz,u3) as well. We call (ui,uz,u3) the
curvilinear coordinates of the point.
If uz and Us are constant, then as Ui varies,
r describes a curve which we call the u\ coordinate
curve. Similarly we define the «2 and us coordi-
nate curves through P.
From (18), we have
(19)
Fig. 5-9
The vector dt/dui is tangent to the Ui coordinate curve at P. If ei is a unit vector at P
in this direction, we can write dr/dui = hid where hi = \dr/dui\. 
Similarly we can
write 
dr/du2 = A2e2 and dr/du3 - /J3e3, where h2 = \dr/duz\ 
and h3 = \dr/du3\ 
respec-
tively. Then (19) can be written
dr 
— hiduei + hiduzCz + h3duae3 
(20)
The quantities hi, hz, hs are sometimes called scale factors.
If ei, 62, e3 are mutually perpendicular at any point P, the curvilinear coordinates are
called orthogonal. In such case the element of arc length ds is given by
ds2 
= dr-dr 
= hi dui + h\du\ + hldul 
(21)
and corresponds to the square of the length of the diagonal in the above parallelepiped.
Also, in the case of orthogonal coordinates the volume of the parallelepiped is given by
dV

| (hi dui ei) • (hz duz e2) x (h3 du3 e3) \ — hihzh3 dui duz du3 
(22)
which can be written as
where

is called the Jacobian of the transformation.
It is clear that when the Jacobian is identically zero there is no parallelepiped. In such
case there is a functional relationship between x, y and z, i.e. there is a function <j> such that
<t>(%> y>z) - 0 identically.

Show that addition of vectors is commutative, i.e. A + B = B + A. See Fig. (a) below.
OP + PQ = OQ

A + B = C
and 
OR + RQ = OQ or

Show that the addition of vectors is associative, i.e. A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C.
See Fig. (b) above.
OP + PQ = OQ = (A + B) 
and 
PQ + QR = PR = (B + C)
Since 
OP + PR = OR = D, 
i.e. A + (B + C) = D
OQ + QR = OR = D, 
i.e. (A + B) + C = D
we have A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C.
Extensions of the results of Problems 5.1 and 5.2 show that the order of addition of any
number of vectors is immaterial.
5.3. 
Prove that the line joining the midpoint of two sides
of a triangle is parallel to the third side and has
half its length.
From Fig. 5-12, AC + CB = AB or b + a = c.
Let DE = d be the line joining the midpoints of sides AC
and CB. Then
d = DC + CE = £b + £a = £(b + a) = £c
Thus d is parallel to c and has half its length.

Prove that the projection of A on B is equal to
A-b, where b is a unit vector in the direction
of B.
Through the initial and terminal points of A pass
planes perpendicular to B at G and H respectively as in
the adjacent Fig. 5-15; then
Projection of A on B = GH = EF = A cos e — A • b
5.7. 
Prove A- (B + C) = A-B + A-C.
Let a be a unit vector in the direction of A; then [see Fig. 5-16]
Projection of (B + C) on A = projection of B on A + projection of C on A
(B + C)-a = B-a + C-a
Multiplying by A,
(B + C)'Aa = B-Aa + C'Aa
and 
(B + C) • A = B • A + C • A
Then by the commutative law for dot products,

Then D has the same magnitude as C but is opposite in direction, i.e. C = -D or A X B =

The commutative law for cross products is not valid.
5.13. Prove that A x ( B + C) = AxB +
A x C for the case where A is per-
pendicular to B and also to C.
Since A is perpendicular to B, A X B is a
vector perpendicular to the plane of A and B
and having magnitude AB sin 90° = AB or
magnitude of AB. This is equivalent to mul-
tiplying vector B by A and rotating the
resultant vector through 90° to the position
shown in Fig. 5-18.
Similarly, A X C is the vector obtained
by multiplying C by A and rotating the
resultant vector through 90° to the position
shown.
In like manner, A X (B + C) is the vector
obtained by multiplying B + C by A and
rotating the resultant vector through 90° to
the position shown.
Since A X (B + C) is the diagonal of the
parallelogram with A X B and A X C as sides

5.14. Prove that A x ( B + C) = AxB + AxC
in the general case where A,B and C are
non-coplanar. See Fig. 5-19.
Resolve B into two component vectors, one
perpendicular to A and the other parallel to A,
and denote them by B± and BM respectively.
Then B = Bj_ +B|(.
If 9 is the angle between A and B, then
Bj_ = B sin e. Thus the magnitude of A X Bx
is AB sin e, the same as the magnitude of A X B.
Also, the direction A X B is the same as the
direction of A X B. 
Hence A X Bj_ = A X B .
Similarly if C is resolved into two compo-
nent vectors CN and Cj_, parallel and perpen-
dicular respectively to A, then A X C± =AXC. 
Fig. 5-19
Also, since B + C = B± + B,, + Cj_ + CM = (Bj_ + Cx) + (BM + C,,) it follows that
A X (Bj_ + Cj_) = A X (B + C)
Now BX and Cj_ are vectors perpendicular to A and so by Problem 5.13,
AX(B ± + CX) = A X B x + A X C j _
Then 
A X ( B + C ) 
= A X B + AXC
and the distributive law holds. Multiplying by —1, using Problem 5.12, this becomes (B + C) X A —
B X A + C X A. Note that the order of factors in cross products is important. The usual laws of
algebra apply only if proper order is maintained.

DOUBLE INTEGRALS
Let F(x, y) be defined in a closed region ^ of the
xy plane (see Fig. 6-1). Subdivide <3?. into n sub-
regions A"^ of area &Ak, k = 1,2,...,n. Let (¿k,%)
be some point of A<Rfc. Form the sum
(1)
Consider
(*)
where the limit is taken so that the number n of sub-
divisions increases without limit and such that the
largest linear dimension of each A^fc approaches
zero. If this limit exists it is denoted by
Fig. 6-1
(3)
and is called the double integral of F(x, y) over the region "5?..
It can be proved that the limit does exist if F(x, y) is continuous (or piecewise con-
tinuous) in <%.
ITERATED INTEGRALS
If "^ is such that any lines parallel to the y axis meet the boundary of ^ in at most
two points (as is true in Fig. 6-1), then we can write the equations of the curves ACB
and ADB bounding ^ as y = fi(x) and y = f-¿(x) respectively, where fi(x) and fz(x) 
are
single-valued and continuous in a ë x à b. In this case we can evaluate the double
integral (3) by choosing the regions A^fc as rectangles formed by constructing a grid of
lines parallel to the x and y axes and AAk as the corresponding areas. Then (3) can be
written
(4)
where the integral in braces is to be evaluated first (keeping x constant) and finally
integrating with respect to x from a to b. The result (4) indicates how a double integral
can be evaluated by expressing it in terms of two single integrals called iterated integrals.

If ^ is such that any lines parallel to the x axis meet the boundary of <% in at most
two points (as in Fig. 6-1), then the equations of curves CAD and CBD can be written
x = gi(y) and x = g2(y) respectively and we find similarly
(5)
If the double integral exists, (4) and (5) will in general yield the same value. In writing a
double integral, either of the forms (4) or (5), whichever is appropriate, may be used. We
call one form an interchange of the order of integration with respect to the other form.
In case <^ is not of the type shown in the above figure, it can generally be subdivided
into regions "3^, <R,2, ... which are of this type. Then the double integral over ^ is found
by taking the sum of the double integrals over "3^, ^^ ....
TRIPLE INTEGRALS
The above results are easily generalized to closed regions in three dimensions. For
example, consider a function F(x,y,z) defined in a closed three dimensional region "tR..
Subdivide the region into n subrogions of volume AFfc, k = 1,2,..., n. Letting (ffc, i)k, £fc)
be some point in each subregion, we form
(«)
where the number n of subdivisions approaches infinity in such a way that the largest
linear dimension of each subregion approaches zero. If this limit exists we denote it by
(7)
called the triple integral of F(x, y, z) over <R. The limit does exist if F(x, y, z) is continu-
ous (or piecewise continuous) in <]{.
If we construct a grid consisting of planes parallel to the xy, yz and xz planes, the
region ^ is subdivided into subrogions which are rectangular parallelepipeds. 
In such
case we can express the triple integral over ^ given by (7) as an iterated integral of the
form
(*)
(where the innermost integral is to be evaluated first) or the sum of such integrals. The
integration can also be performed in any other order to give an equivalent result.
Extensions to higher dimensions are also possible.
TRANSFORMATIONS OF MULTIPLE INTEGRALS
In evaluating a multiple integral over a region <?(, it is often convenient to use
coordinates other than rectangular, such as the curvilinear coordinates considered in
Chapter 5.

If we let (u,v) be curvilinear coordinates of points in a plane, there will be a set of
transformation equations x = f(u, v), y = g(u, v) mapping points (x, y) of the xy plane
into points (u,v) of the uv plane. In such case the region <3( of the xy plane is mapped
into a region <^' of the uv plane. We then have

valued functions defined at all points of C.
Subdivide C into n parts by choosing (n — 1)
points on it given by (xi,yi), (x2,y2), .. .,(*»-!,

The limit does exist if P and Q are continuous (or piecewise continuous) at all points of C.
The value of the integral depends in general on P, Q, the particular curve C, and on the
limits (ai, &i) and (a2, ba).
In an exactly analogous manner one may define a line integral along a curve C in
three dimensional space as
(15)
where A\, A2 and A3 are functions of x, y and z.
Other types of line integrals, depending on particular curves, can be defined. 
For
example, if Ask denotes the arc length along curve C in the above figure between points
(xk,yk) and (xk+i,yk+i), then
(16)
is called the line integral of U(x,y) along curve C. Extensions to three (or higher)
dimensions are possible.
VECTOR NOTATION FOR LINE INTEGRALS
It is often convenient to express a line integral in vector form as an aid in physical
or geometric understanding as well as for brevity of notation. 
For example, we can
express the line integral (15) in the form
(17)
where A = Aii + A2j + Ask and dr = dxi + dyj + dzk. 
The line integral (14) is a
special case of this with z — 0.
If at each point (x, y, z) we associate a force F acting on an object (i.e. if a force field
is defined), then
(18)
represents physically the total work done in moving the object along the curve C.
EVALUATION OF LINE INTEGRALS
If the equation of a curve C in the plane z — 0 is given as y = f(x), the line integral
(14) is evaluated by placing y - f(x), dy = f'(x) dx in the integrand to obtain the definite
integral
(19)
which is then evaluated in the usual manner.
Similarly if C is given as x = g(y), then dx = g'(y) dy and the line integral becomes
(20)

CHAP. 6] 
MULTIPLE, LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS. INTEGRAL THEOREMS 
151
If C is given in parametric form x = $(t), y - <¡,(t), the line integral becomes
(21)
where U and ¿2 denote the values of t corresponding to points A and B respectively.
Combinations of the above methods may be used in the evaluation.
Similar methods are used for evaluating line integrals along space curves.
PROPERTIES OF LINE INTEGRALS
Line integrals have properties which are analogous to those of ordinary integrals.
For example:
Thus reversal of the path of integration changes the sign of the line integral.

where (a3, b3) is another point on C.
Similar properties hold for line integrals in space.
SIMPLE CLOSED CURVES. SIMPLY AND MULTIPLY-CONNECTED REGIONS
A simple closed curve is a closed curve which does not intersect itself anywhere.
Mathematically, a curve in the xy plane is defined by the parametric equations x = <£(i),
y = $(t) where <£ and 
<l> are single-valued and continuous in an interval íi á t a Í2. If
4>(ti) = <t>(ta) and ^(ii) = ^(£2), the curve is said to be closed. If 
<¡>(u) = <¡>(v) and 
<¡/(u) = *¡>(v)
only when u = v (except in the special case where u = íi and v = ¿2), the curve is closed
and does not intersect itself and so is a simple closed curve. We shall also assume, unless
otherwise stated, that <j> and ^ are piecewise differentiate in íi a t á Í2.
If a plane region has the property that any closed curve in it can be continuously
shrunk to a point without leaving the region, then the region is called simply-connected,
otherwise it is called multiply-connected [see Problem 6.19].
As the parameter t varies from ti to tz, the plane curve is described in a certain sense
or direction. For curves in the xy plane, we arbitrarily describe this direction as positive
or negative according as a person traversing the curve in this direction with his head
pointing in the positive z direction has the region enclosed by the curve always toward his
left or right respectively. If we look down upon a simple closed curve in the xy plane, this
amounts to saying that traversal of the curve in the counterclockwise direction is taken
as positive while traversal in the clockwise direction is taken as negative.
GREEN'S THEOREM IN THE PLANE
Let P,Q,dP/dy,dQ/dx 
be single-valued and continuous in a simply-connected region
^ bounded by a simple closed curve C. Then
(22)

152 
MULTIPLE, LINE AND SURFACE INTEGRALS. INTEGRAL THEOREMS 
[CHAP. 6
where 
is used to emphasize that C is closed and that it is described in the positive
direction".
This theorem is also true for regions bounded by two or more closed curves (i.e.
multiply-connected regions). See Problem 6.19.
CONDITIONS FOR A LINE INTEGRAL TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE PATH
Theorem 6-1. A necessary and sufficient condition for 
to be independent
of the path C joining any two given points in a region ^ is that in ^
dP/dy = dQ/dx 
(23)
where it is supposed that these partial derivatives are continuous in ^.
The condition (23) is also the condition that Pdx + Qdy is an exact differential,
i.e. that there exists a function <f>(x,y) such that Pdx + Qdy = d^>. In such case if the
end points of curve C are (x\, yi) and (xz, y¿), the value of the line integral is given by
(24)
In particular if (23) holds and C is closed, we have Xi = x-2, y\ — yz and
(25)
For proofs and related theorems, see Problems 6.22 and 6.23.
The results in Theorem 6-1 can be extended to line integrals in space. Thus we have

independent of the path C joining any two given points in a region ^ is
that in ^
(26)
where it is supposed that these partial derivatives are continuous in "•£.
The results can be expressed concisely in terms of vectors. If A = Aii + A2j + Ask,
the line integral can be written 
A-dr and condition (26) is equivalent to the condition
If A represents a force field F which acts on an object, the result is equiv-
alent to the statement that the work done in moving the object from one point to another
is independent of the path joining the two points if and only if

The results (33) or (34) can be used to evaluate (30).
In the above we have assumed that S is such that any line parallel to the z axis
intersects S in only one point. In case S is not of this type, we can usually subdivide S
into surfaces Si,S2, :.. which are of this type. Then the surface integral over S is defined
as the sum of the surface integrals over Si, S2,... .
The results stated hold when S is projected on to a region ^ of the xy plane. In some
cases it is better to project S on to the yz or xz planes. 
For such cases (30) can be
evaluated by appropriately modifying (33) and (34).
SURFACE INTEGRALS
Let S be a two-sided surface having
projection 'R. on the xy plane as in the
adjoining Fig. 6-3. 
Assume that an
equation for S is z = f(x, y), where / is
single-valued and continuous for all x

THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM
Let S be a closed surface bounding a region of volume V. Choose the outward drawn
normal to the surface as the -positive normal and assume that a, p, y are the angles which
this normal makes with the positive x, y and z axes respectively. Then if At, A2 and A3 are
continuous and have continuous partial derivatives in the region
(35)
which can also be written
(36)
In vector form with A = Aa +A2j + Ask and n = cos ai + cos /Jj + cos yk, these can be
simply written as
(37)
In words this theorem, called the divergence theorem or Green's theorem in space, states
that the surface integral of the normal component of a vector A taken over a closed
surface is equal to the integral of the divergence of A taken over the volume enclosed
by the surface.
STOKES' THEOREM
Let S be an open, two-sided surface bounded by a closed non-intersecting curve C
(simple closed curve). Consider a directed line normal to S as positive if it is on one side
of S, and negative if it is on the other side of S. The choice of which side is positive is
arbitrary but should be decided upon in advance. Call the direction or sense of C posi-
tive if an observer, walking on the boundary of <S with his head pointing in the direction
of the positive normal, has the surface on his left. Then if Ai,A2, A3 are single-valued,
continuous, and have continuous first partial derivatives in a region of space including S,
we have
(38)
In vector form with A = Aii + A2j + A3k and n = cos ai + cos/îj + cos-yk, this is simply
expressed as
(39)
In words this theorem, called Stokes' theorem, states that the line integral of the
tangential component of a vector A taken around a simple closed curve C is equal to the
surface integral of the normal component of the curl of A taken over any surface S
having C as a boundary. Note that if, as a special case V x A = 0 in (39), we obtain
the result (28).

The integration with respect to y (keeping x constant) from y — 1 to y — x2 corresponds

By hypothesis dP/dy and dQ/dx are continuous in "3J, so that there must be some region r con-

Since the line integral is independent of the path, choose any path joining (1,2) and (3,4),
for example that consisting of lines from (1,2) to (3,2) [along which y = 2, dy = 0] and then
(3,2) to (3,4) [along which * = 3, dx = 0]. Then the required integral equals
Method 2.
Since ^ = ||, we must have (1) || = Qxy2 - y3, (2) |^ = 6x*y - 3xy2.
From (1), 
<t> = 3x2y2 — xy3 + f(y). 
From (2), 
<f> = 3x2y2 — xy3 + g(x). 
The only way in
which these two expressions for 
<f> are equal is if f(y) = g(x) = c, a constant. Hence $ =
SxV - xya + c. Then
Note that in this evaluation the arbitrary constant c can be omitted.
We could also have noted by inspection that
(6xy2 - y3) dx + (6x2y - 3xy2) dy = (6xy2 dx + Qx2y dy) - (y3 dx + 3xy2 dy)
= 
d(3x2y2) - d(xy3) = d(3x2y2 - xy3)

Q — x2 sin x — 2yex.
Then dP/dy = x2 cos x + 2x sin x — 2yex — dQ/dx, so that by Problem 6.20 the line integral

In dealing with surface integrals we have restricted ourselves to surfaces which are
two-sided. Give an example of a surface which is not two-sided.
Take a strip of paper such as ABCD as
shown in the adjoining Fig. 6-22. Twist the
strip so that points A and B fall on D and C
respectively, as in the adjoining figure. If n
is the positive normal at point P of the sur-
face, we find that as n moves around the
surface it reverses its original direction when
it reaches P again. If we tried to color only
one side of the surface we would find the
whole thing colored. This surface, called a
Moebius strip, is an example of a one-sided
surface. 
This is sometimes called a non-
orientable surface. 
A two-sided surface is
orientable.

The theorem can be extended to surfaces which are such that lines parallel to the coordinate

Since here

F is conservative.
(6) Method 1.
By Problem 6.38, F • dr = (2xz3 + 6y) dx + (Gx - 2yz) dy + (Bx2z2 - y2) dz is an exact dif-
ferential d<j>, where <f> is such that

<6 = xW + Gxy + f^y.z) 
0 = 6xy - y*z + f2(x, z)

These are consistent if f1 (y, z) = —yzz + c, /2 (x, z) = x2z3 + c, fs (x, y) = 6xy + c in which case
<f> = X2z3 + Gxy - y2z + c. Thus by Problem 6.38,
Alternatively we may notice by inspection that
F • dr = 
(2xz3 dx + 3x*z2 dz) + (6y dx + 6x dy) - (2yz dy + yz dz)
= 
d(x2zs) + d(6xy) - d(y2z) 
= d(x2zs + 6xy - y2z + c)
from which 0 is determined.
Method 2.
Since the integral is independent of the path, we can choose any path to evaluate it; in
particular we can choose the path consisting of straight lines from (1, —1,1) to (2, —1,1), then
to (2,1,1) and then to (2,1, -1). 
The result is
where the first integral is obtained from the line integral by placing y = —1, z = 1, dy = 0,
dz — 0; the second integral by placing x = 2, z = 1, dx = 0, dz — 0; and the third integral by
placing x — 2, y — I, dx — 0, dy — 0.
(c) Physically 
F • dr represents the work done in moving an object from (1, —1,1) to (2,1, —1)
along C. In a conservative force field the work done is independent of the path C joining these
points.

PERIODIC FUNCTIONS
A function f(x) is said to have a period T or to be periodic with period T if for all x,
f(x + T)- f(x), where T is a positive constant. The least value of T > 0 is called the
least period or simply the period of /(#).
Example 1. The function sin x has periods 2ir, 4v, &¡r, ..., since sin (x + 2v), sin (x + 4s-), sin (* + 6n-),
... all equal sin x. However, 2ir is the least period or the period of sin x.
Example 2. The period of sin nx or cos nx, where M is a positive integer, is 2ir/n.
Example 3. The period of tan x is ir.
Example 4. A constant has any positive number as period.
Other examples of periodic functions are shown in the graphs of Figures 7-l(a), (b)
and (c) below.

FOURIER SERIES
Let f(x) be defined in the interval (—L, L) and outside of this interval by f(x + 2L) = f(x),
i.e. assume that f(x) has the period 2L. The Fourier series or Fourier expansion corre-
sponding to f(x) is given by
(1)
where the Fourier coefficients an and bn are
(2)
If f(x) has the period 2L, the coefficients an and bn can be determined equivalently
from

where c is any real number. In the special case c = —L, (3) becomes (2).

To determine a0 in (1), we use (2) or (3) with n - 0. For example, from (2) we
see t h a t f ( x ) d x . 
Note that the constant term in (1) is equal to 
=
/(a;) àx, which is the mean of f(x) over a period.
If L = r, the series (1) and the coefficients (2) or (3) are particularly simple. The
function in this case has the period 2-*.
DIRICHLET CONDITIONS
Theorem 7-1. Suppose that
(1) f(x) is defined and single-valued except possibly at a finite number of
points in (—L,L)
(2) f(x) is periodic outside (—L,L) with period 2L
(3) f(x) and f'(x) are piecewise continuous in (—L,L).
Then the series (1) with coefficients (2) or (3) converges to
(a) 
f(x) if a; is a point of continuity
(6) 
if z is a point of discontinuity
In this theorem f(x + 0) and f(x — 0) are the right and left hand limits of f(x) at x and
represent lim f(x + £) and lim f(x — e) respectively where e > 0. These are often written
£-*0 
e-»0
lim f(x + e) and lim f i x — <•) to emphasize that « is approaching zero through positive
e-»0+ 
e-»0 +
values. For a proof see Problems 7.18-7.23.
The conditions (1), (2) and (3) imposed on f(x) are sufficient 
but not necessary, and
are generally satisfied in practice. There are at present no known necessary and sufficient
conditions for convergence of Fourier series. It is of interest that continuity of f(x) does
not alone insure convergence of a Fourier series.
ODD AND EVEN FUNCTIONS
A function f(x) is called odd if /(—*) = —/(«)• Thus x3, x5 — Sx3 + 2x, sin x, tan 3a;
are odd functions.
A function f(x) is called even if f(—x) = f(x). 
Thus x4, 2x6 — 4a;2+ 5, cosa;, ex + e~x
are even functions.
The functions portrayed graphically in Figures 7-l(a) and 7-1(6) are odd and even
respectively, but that of Fig. 7-1 (c) is neither odd nor even.
In the Fourier series corresponding to an odd function, only sine terms can be
present. In the Fourier series corresponding to an even function, only cosine terms (and
possibly a constant which we shall consider a cosine term) can be present.
HALF RANGE FOURIER SINE OR COSINE SERIES
A half range Fourier sine or cosine series is a series in which only sine terms or
only cosine terms are present respectively. 
When a half range series corresponding to
a given function is desired, the function is generally defined in the interval (0, L) [which
is half of the interval (-L,L), thus accounting for the name half range] and then the

134 
FOURIER SERIES 
[CHAP. 7
function is specified as odd or even, so that it is clearly defined in the other half of the
interval, namely (-L, 0). In such case, we have
for half range sine series
(4)
for half range cosine series
PARSEVAL'S IDENTITY states that
(5)
if an and bn are the Fourier coefficients corresponding to f(x) and if f(x) satisfies the Dirichlet
conditions.
DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION OF FOURIER SERIES
Differentiation and integration of Fourier series can be justified by using the theorems
on page 7 which hold for series in general. It must be emphasized, however, that those
theorems provide sufficient conditions and are not necessary. The following theorem for
integration is especially useful.
Theorem 7-2. The Fourier series corresponding to f(x) may be integrated term by term
from a to x, and the resulting series will converge uniformly to 
f(u) du
provided that f(x) is piecewise continuous in — L ê x a L and both a and x
are in this interval.
COMPLEX NOTATION FOR FOURIER SERIES
Using Euler's identities,
e*» = cos 0 + i sin O, 
e~u = cos 9 - i sin e 
(6)
where i = 
[see Problem 1.61, page 30], the Fourier series for f(x) can be written as
where 
c» 
= 
(8)
In writing the equality (7), we are supposing that the Dirichlet conditions are satisfied
and further that f(x) is continuous at x. If f(x) is discontinuous at x, the left side of (7)
should be replaced by
ORTHOGONAL FUNCTIONS
Two vectors A and B are called orthogonal (perpendicular) if A • B = 0 or AiBi +
AzBz + A3B3 = 0, where A = AJ + A2j + Aak and B = BA + B2j + #sk. Although not geo-
metrically or physically evident, these ideas can be generalized to include vectors with
(

CHAP. 7] 
FOURIER SERIES

more than three components. In particular we can think of a function, say A(x), as being a
vector with an infinity of components (i.e. an infinite dimensional vector), the value of each
component being specified by substituting a particular value of x in some interval (a, b).
It is natural in such case to define two functions, A(x) and B(x), as orthogonal in (a, b) if
(9)
A vector A is called a unit vector or normalized vector if its magnitude is unity, i.e.
if A-A = A2 = 1. Extending the concept, we say that the function A(x) is normal or
normalized in (a, b) if
(10)
From the above it is clear that we can consider a set of functions {</>fc(*)}, k = 1,2,3,...,
having the properties
(11)
(12)
In such case, each member of the set is orthogonal to every other member of the set and
is also normalized. We call such a set of functions an orthonormal set in (a, b).
The equations (11) and (12) can be summarized by writing
(13)
where 8mn, called Kronecker's symbol, is defined as 0 if m ¥* n and 1 if m = n.
Just as any vector r in 3 dimensions can be expanded in a set of mutually orthogonal
unit vectors i, j, k in the form r = di + Caj + c3k, so we consider the possibility of expanding
a function f(x) in a set of orthonormal functions, i.e.,
(U)
Such series, called orthonormal series, are generalizations of Fourier series and are of great
interest and utility both from theoretical and applied viewpoints.
If 
(15)
where w(x) ê 0, we often say that $m(x) and qn(x) are orthonormal with respect to the
density function or weight function w(x). In such case the set of functions 
is
an orthonormal set in (a, 6).

A Fourier series consisting of cosine terms alone is obtained only for an even function. Hence
we extend the definition of f(x) so that it becomes even (dashed part of Fig. 7-10 below). With this
extension, f(x) is then defined in an interval of length 2ir. Taking the period as 2jr, we have

indicates that as M -» °° the mean square error approaches zero, while Bessel's inequality indicates
the possibility that this mean square error does not approach zero.
The results are connected with the idea of completeness of an orthonormal set. If, for example,
we were to leave out one or more terms in a Fourier series (say cos 4vx/L, for example) we could
never get the mean square error to approach zero no matter how many terms we took. For an
analogy with 3 dimensional vectors, see Problem 7.46.

Bessel Functions
BESSEL'S DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
Bessel functions arise as solutions of the differential equation
(1)
which is called Bessel's differential equation. The general solution of (1) is given by
(*)
The solution Jn(x), which has a finite limit as x approaches zero, is called a Bessel function
of the first kind and order n. The solution Yn(x) which has no finite limit [i.e. is unbounded]
as x approaches zero, is called a Bessel function of the second kind and order n or Neumann
function.
If the independent variable x in (1) is changed to \x where X is a constant, the resulting
equation is
(3)
with general solution

BESSEL FUNCTIONS OF THE FIRST KIND
We define the Bessel function of the first kind of order n as

(6)
where T(n +1) is the gamma function [Chapter 9]. If n is a positive integer, T(n +1) = n\,
r(l) = 1. For n = 0, (6) becomes
(7)
The series (6) converges for all x. Graphs of Jo(x)
and Ji(x) are shown in Fig. 10-1.
If n is half an odd integer, Jn(x) can be ex-
pressed in terms of sines and cosines. See Problems
10.4 and 10.7.
A function J-n(x), n>0, can be defined by re-
placing n by -n in (5) or (6). If n is an integer
then we can show that [see Problem 10.3]

GENERATING FUNCTION FOR Jn(x)
The function 
(18)
is called the generating function for Bessel functions of the first kind of integral order.
It is very useful in obtaining properties of these functions for integer values of n which
can then often be proved for all values of n.

If n is an integer these can be proved by using the generating function. Note that results

places Jn(x).

ASYMPTOTIC FORMULAS FOR BESSEL FUNCTIONS
For large values of x we have the following asymptotic formulas
(26)
ZEROS OF BESSEL FUNCTIONS
We can show that if n is any real number, Jn(x) = 0 has an infinite number of roots
which are all real. The difference between successive roots approaches 
-n- as the roots
increase in value. This can be seen from (26). We can also show that the roots of Jn(x) — 0
lie between those of Jn-i(x) = 0 and Jn+i(x) = 0. Similar remarks can be made for Yn(x).
ORTHOGONALITY OF BESSEL FUNCTIONS
If A and [i are two different constants, we can show [see Problem 10.21] that
(27)
while [see Problem 10.22]
(28)
From (27) we can see that if A and ^ are any two different roots of the equation
(29)
where R and S are constants, then
(30)
which states that the functions 
and 
are orthogonal in (0,1). Note that
as special cases of (29) we see that A and /n can be any two different roots of Jn(x) = 0 or
Jn(x) — 0. We can also say that the functions Jn(\x), Jn([j.x) are orthogonal with respect to
the density function x.
SERIES OF BESSEL FUNCTIONS
As in the case of Fourier series, we can show that if f(x) satisfies the Dirichlet condi-
tions [page 183] then at every point of continuity of f(x) in the interval 0 < x < 1 there will
exist a Bessel series expansion having the form
(31)
where \\, Aa, As, ... are the positive roots of (29) with R/S § 0, S ¥* 0 and
(32)
At any point of discontinuity the series on the right in (31) converges to £[/(# + 0) + f(x — 0)]
which can be used in place of the left side of (31).

Then by addition,

Note that the definition of Jn(x) on page 224 agrees with the series of Case 1 in Problem 10.1,
apart from a constant factor depending only on n. It follows that (5) can be written y = AJn(x) +
BJ_n(x) for the cases n ¥= 0,1,2,
10.3. (a) Prove that /_„(«) = (-!)"/„(x) for « = 1,2,3, ...
(6) Use (a) to explain why AJn(x) + BJ-n(x) is not the general solution of Bessel's
equation for integer values of n.
(a) Replacing n by — n in (5) or the equivalent (6) on page 224, we have
Now since r(—n + r + 1) is infinite for r = 0,1, ..., n — 1, the first sum on the right is zero.
Letting r = n + k in the second sum, it becomes
(6) From (a) it follows that for integer values of n, J-n(x) and Jn(x) are linearly dependent and
so AJn(x) + BJ-n(x) cannot be a general solution of Bessel's equation. If n is not an integer,
then we can show that J-n(x) and Jn(x) are linearly independent so that AJn(x) + BJ^n(x)
is a general solution [see Problem 10.10].

If \x\ < 1, the Legendre functions of the second kind are given by the following ac-
cording as n is even or odd respectively:
For n > 1, these coefficients are taken so that the recurrence formulas for Pn(x) above apply
also to Qn(x).
ORTHOGONALITY OF LEGENDRE POLYNOMIALS
The following results are fundamental:

The first shows that any two different Legendre polynomials are orthogonal in the interval
-1< x < 1.
SERIES OF LEGENDRE POLYNOMIALS
If f(x) satisfies the Dirichlet conditions [Page 183], then at every point of continuity of
f(x) in the interval —Kx<l there will exist a Legendre series expansion having the form

(10)
At any point of discontinuity the series on the right in (9) converges to %[f(x + 0) + f(x - 0)]
which can be used to replace the left side of (9).
ASSOCIATED LEGENDRE FUNCTIONS
The differential equation
(11)
is called Legendre's associated differential equation. If m — 0 this reduces to Legendre's
equation (1). Solutions to (11) are called associated Legendre functions. We consider the
case where m and n are non-negative integers. In this case the general solution of (11) is
given by

STURM-LIOUVILLE SYSTEMS

(36)
where ai, a2, 61, 62 are given constants; p(x), q(x), r(x) are given functions which we shall
assume to be diiferentiable and A. is an unspecified parameter independent of x, is called a
Sturm-Liouville boundary-value problem or Sturm-Liouville system.
A non-trivial solution of this system, i.e. one which is not identically zero, exists in
general only for a particular set of values of the parameter A. These values are called
the characteristic values, or more often eigenvalues, of the system. The corresponding
solutions are called characteristic functions or eigenfunctions of the system. 
In general
to each eigenvalue there is one eigenfunction, although exceptions can occur.
If p(x), q(x) are real, then the eigenvalues are real. Also the eigenfunctions form an
orthogonal set with respect to the density function r(x) which is generally taken as non-
negative, i.e. r(x) =£ 0. It follows that by suitable normalization the set of functions can be
made an orthonormal set with respect to r(x) in a ^ x ^ b.

LEGENDRE'S DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
11.1. Use the method of Frobenius to find series solutions of Legendre's differential equa-

Assuming a solution of the form y = '2,ckxk+& where the summation index fe goes from
—oo to oo and ek = 0 for fc < 0, we have
Then by addition,
and since the coefficient of xk+& must be zero, we find
(1)
Letting fc = — 2 we obtain, since c_2 = 0, the indicial equation 
13(13 — I)c0 = 0 or, assuming
c0 ¥= 0, /J = 0 or 1.
Case 1, /? = 0.
In this case (1) becomes
(2)
Putting fc = —1,0,1,2,3,... in succession, we find that ct is arbitrary while
and so we obtain
(3)
Since this leads to a solution with two arbitrary constants, we need not consider Case 2, ft — 1.
For an even integer TO S 0, the first of the above series terminates and gives a polynomial
solution. For an odd integer TO > 0, the second series terminates and gives a polynomial solution.
Thus for any integer n fe 0 the equation has polynomial solutions. If n = 0,1,2,3, for example,
we obtain from (S) the polynomial
which are, apart from a multiplicative constant, Legendre polynomials.

SOME DEFINITIONS INVOLVING PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
A partial differential equation is an equation containing an unknown function of two or
more variables and its partial derivatives with respect to these variables.
The order of a partial differential equation is that of the highest ordered derivative
present.
Example 1
.
i
s 
a partial differential equation of order two, or a second order
partial differential equation.
A solution of a partial differential equation is any function which satisfies the equation
identically.
The general solution is a solution which contains a number of arbitrary independent
functions equal to the order of the equation.
A particular solution is one which can be obtained from the general solution by particu-
lar choice of the arbitrary functions.
Example 2. As seen by substitution, u = x*y - \xyi + F(x) + G(y) is a solution of the partial
differential equation of Example 1. Because it contains two arbitrary independent
functions F(x) and G(y), it is the general solution. If in particular F(x) = 2 sin x,
G(y) = Sj/4 — 5, we obtain the particular solution u = x*y — ^xy2 + 2 sin « + Sy* — 5.
A singular solution is one which cannot be obtained from the general solution by par-
ticular choice of the arbitrary functions.
A boundary-value problem involving a partial differential equation seeks all solutions of
a partial differential equation which satisfy conditions called boundary conditions. Theo-
rems relating to the existence and uniqueness of such solutions are called existence and
uniqueness theorems.
LINEAR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
The general linear partial differential 
equation of order two in two independent varia-
bles has the form
(*)
where A, B, ..., G may depend on x and y but not on u. A second order equation with
independent variables x and y which does not have the form (1) is called nonlinear.
If G = 0 the equation is called homogeneous, while if G ¥• 0 it is called non-homoge-
neous. Generalizations to higher order equations are easily made.
Because of the nature of the solutions of (1) the equation is often classified as elliptic,
hyperbolic or parabolic according as B2 - 4AC is less than, greater than or equal to zero
respectively.

SOME IMPORTANT PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
1. Heat Conduction Equation
Here u(x, y, z, t) is the temperature in a solid at position (x, y, z) at time t. The con-
stant K, called the diffusivity, 
is equal to K/<TT where the thermal conductivity K, the
specific heat <r and the density (mass per unit volume) r are assumed constant.
In case u does not depend on y and z, the equation reduces t o c a l l e d the
one-dimensional heat conduction equation.
2. Vibrating String Equation
This equation is applicable to the small
transverse vibrations of a taut, flexible string,
such as a violin string, initially located on the
x axis and set into motion [see Fig. 12-1]. The
function y(x, t) is the displacement of any point
x of the string at time t. The constant a2 = T/ju,
where T is the (constant) tension in the string
and ti is the (constant) mass per unit length of
the string. It is assumed that no external forces
act on the string but that it vibrates only due 
Fig. 12-1
to its elasticity.
The equation can easily be generalized to higher dimensions as for example the vi-
brations of a membrane or drum head in two dimensions. In two dimensions, for exam-
ple, the equation is
3. Laplace's Equation
This equation occurs in many fields. In the theory of heat conduction, for example,
v is the steady-state temperature, i.e. the temperature after a long time has elapsed,
and is equivalent to putting du/dt = 0 in the heat conduction equation above. In the
theory of gravitation or electricity v represents the gravitational or electric potential
respectively. For this reason the equation is often called the potential equation.
4. Longitudinal Vibrations of a Beam
This equation describes the motion of a beam [Fig. 12-2] which can vibrate longi-
tudinally [i.e. in the x direction]. The variable u(x, t) is the longitudinal displacement
from the equilibrium position of the cross sec-
tion at x. The constant c2 = gE/r where g is
the acceleration due to gravity, E is the modu-
lus of elasticity [stress divided by strain] and
depends on the properties of the beam, r is the
density [mass per unit volume].
Note that this equation is the same as that
for a vibrating string. 
Fig. 12-2

260 
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 
[CHAP. 12
5. Transverse Vibrations of a Beam
This equation describes the motion of a beam [initially located on the x axis, see
Fig. 12-3] which is vibrating transversely (i.e. perpendicular to the x direction). In this
case y(x,t) is the transverse displacement or
deflection at any time t of any point x. The
constant &
2 = Elg/p where E is the modulus
of elasticity, / is the moment of inertia of any
cross section about the x axis, g is the acceler-
ation due to gravity and ju is the mass per unit
length. In case an external transverse force
F(x, t) is applied, the right hand side of the
equation is replaced by b2F(x,t)/EI. 
Fig. 12-3
METHODS OF SOLVING BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEMS
There are many methods by which boundary-value problems involving linear partial dif-
ferential equations can be solved. The following are among the most important.
1. General Solutions.
In this method we first find the general solution and then that particular solution
which satisfies the boundary conditions. The following theorems are of fundamental
importance.
Theorem 12-1 [Superposition principle]. If u\, u2, ...,«„ are solutions of a linear ho-
mogeneous partial differential equation, then ciUi + c2«2 + • • • + cnun where
ci, c2, ..., cn are constants is also a solution.
Theorem 12-2. The general solution of a linear non-homogeneous partial differential equa-
tion is obtained by adding a particular solution of the non-homogeneous
equation to the general solution of the homogeneous equation.
We can sometimes find general solutions by using the methods of ordinary differen-
tial equations. See Problems 12.8 and 12.9.
If A, B, ..., F in (1) are constants, then the general solution of the homogeneous
equation can be found by assuming that u = eax+t>" where a and & are constants to be
determined. See Problems 12.10-12.13.
2. Separation of Variables.
In this method it is assumed that a solution can be expressed as a product of
unknown functions each of which depends on only one of the independent variables.
The success of the method hinges on being able to write the resulting equation so that
one side depends only on one variable while the other side depends on the remaining
variables so that each side must be a constant. By repetition of this the unknown
functions can then be determined. Superposition of these solutions can then be used to
find the actual solution. See Problems 12.15-12.17.
The method often makes use of Fourier series, Fourier integrals, Bessel series and
Legendre series. For illustrations see Problems 12.18-12.28.

CHAP. 12] 
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 
261
3. Laplace Transform Methods.
In this method the Laplace transform of the partial differential equation and
associated boundary conditions are first obtained with respect to one of the independent
variables. We then solve the resulting equation for the Laplace transform of the
required solution which is then found by taking the inverse Laplace transform. 
In
cases where Laplace inversion is of some difficulty the complex inversion formula of
Chapter 14 can be used. For illustrations see Problems 12.29 and 14.15-14.19.

A solution of the partial differential equation is thus given by
u(x, t) = XT

Since u(0, t) = 0, e~2)A (A) = 0 or A = 0. Then
u(x,t) = Be-2*?* sinXse
Since u(S, t) = 0, Be~2>?t sin 3X = 0. 
If B = 0, the solution is identically zero, so we must
have sin 3X = 0 or 3X = mv, X = mv/3 where m = 0, ±1, ±2, .... Thus

This is possible if and only if Bx = 5, m1 = 12, B2 = -S, m2 = 24, Ba = 2,ms = 30.

This boundary-value problem has the following heat flow, interpretation. A bar whose surface
is insulated [Fig. 12-5] has a length of 3 units and a diffusivity of 2 units. If its ends are kept at
temperature zero units and its initial temperature 
u(x, 0) = 5 sin fax — 3 sin 8vx + 2 sin Wvx,
find the temperature at position x at time t, i.e. find u(x, t). We shall assume that c.g.s. units are
used and that temperature is in degrees centigrade (°C). However, other units could of course be
used.

12.17. Find the temperature of the bar in Problem 12.16 if the initial temperature is 25°C.
This problem is identical with Problem 12.16 except that to satisfy the initial condition
u(x, 0) = 25 it is necessary to superimpose an infinite number of solutions, i.e. we must replace
equation (1) of the last problem by
which for t = 0 yields
This amounts to the same thing as expanding 25 in a Fourier sine series. By the methods of
Chapter 7 we then find

PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 
[CHAP. 12
The result can be written
which can be verified as the required solution.
This problem illustrates the importance of Fourier series (and orthogonal series in general) in
solving boundary-value problems.
12.18. Solve the boundary-value problem
This is the same as Problem 12.17 except that the ends of the bar are at temperatures 10°C
and 40°C instead of 0°C. As far as the solution goes this makes quite a difference since we can
no longer conclude that A = 0 and X = mv/3 as in that problem.
To solve the present problem assume that u(x, t) — v(x, t) + $(x) where vK#) is to be suitably
determined. In terms of v(x, t) the boundary-value problem becomes
This can be simplified by choosing
from which we find t(x) — lOa; +10 so that the resulting boundary-value problem is
As in Problem 12.17 we now find from the first three of these,
The last condition yields
from which
Since u(x, t) = v(x, t) + ^(x), we have finally
as the required solution.
The term lOa; +10 is the steady-state temperature, i.e. the temperature after a long time has
elapsed.

where y(x, t) = displacement from x axis at time t
[Fig. 12-6].

PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 
269
Since the ends of the string are fixed at x = 0 and x = L,
y(0,t) = y(L,t) = 0 
t >0
Since the initial shape of the string is given by f(x),
y(x,Q) = f(x) 
Q<x<L
Since the initial velocity of the string is zero,
yt(x, 0) = 0 
0<x<L
To solve this boundary-value problem, let y — XT as usual.
Then 
XT" = a?X"T 
or 
T"/a?T - 
X"IX
Calling the separation constant —X
2, we have
T" + X%2r = 0, 
X" + \2X = 0
and 
T = A! sin Xot + B^ cos \at, 
X = A2 sin Xa; + Bz cos X*
A solution is thus given by
y(x, t) = XT — (A2 sin \x + B2 cos \x)(A1 sin Xat + Bl cos Xat)
From j/(0, t) = 0, A2 = 0, Then
y(x, t) — B2 sin Xa:(Aj sin Xat + Bl cos Xat) = sin \x(A sin Xat + B cos Xat)
From y(L, t) = 0, we have 
sin \L(A sin Xat + B cos Xat) = 0
so that sin XL = 0, XL = ma- or X = mv/L since the second factor must not be equal to zero. Now
yt(x, t) = sin \x(A\a cos Xat — B\a sin Xat)
and yt(x,0) = (sin\x)(A\a) = 0 from which A = 0. Thus
To satisfy the condition y(x, 0) = f(x), it will be necessary to superimpose solutions. 
This
yields
Then
and from the theory of Fourier series,
The result is
which can be verified as the solution.
The terms in this series represent the natural or normal modes of vibration. The frequency of
the mth normal mode fm is obtained from the term involving cos miLa and is given by
Li
Since all the frequencies are integer multiples of the lowest frequency flt the vibrations of the
string will yield a musical tone as in the case of a violin or piano string.

Complex Variables
and Confer ma I Mapping
FUNCTIONS
If to each of a set of complex numbers which a variable z may assume there corre-
sponds one or more values of a variable w, then w is called a function of the complex
variable z, written w = /(z). The fundamental operations with complex numbers have
already been considered in Chapter 1.
A function is single-valued if for each value of z there corresponds only one value of w,
otherwise it is multiple-valued or many-valued. In general we can write w = f(z) =
u(x, y) + iv(x, y), where u and v are real functions of x and y.
Example 1. w = z2 = (x + iy)* - x2 - y2 + 2ixy = u + iv so that u(x, y) = x2 — yz, v(x, y) - Zxy.
These are called the real and imaginary parts of w = *2 respectively.
Unless otherwise specified we shall assume that f(z) is single-valued. A function
which is multiple-valued can be considered as a collection of single-valued functions.
LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
Definitions of limits and continuity for functions of a complex variable are analogous
to those for a real variable. Thus f(z) is said to have the limit I as z approaches za if,
given any « > 0, there exists a 8 > 0 such that \f(z) -l\<c whenever 0 < \z - z»| < 8.
Similarly, f(z) is said to be continuous at z0 if, given any e > 0, there exists a 8 > 0
such that 
whenever 
Alternatively, f(z) is continuous at z0 if
DERIVATIVES
If f(z) is single-valued in some region of the z plane the derivative of f(z), denoted by
f'(z), is defined as
W
provided the limit exists independent of the manner in which Az -» 0. If the limit (1)
exists for z = z0, then f(z) is called analytic at Zo. If the limit exists for all z in a region <5£,
then /(z) is called analytic in ^ In order to be analytic, /(z) must be single-valued and
continuous. The converse, however, is not necessarily true.
We define elementary functions of a complex variable by a natural extension of the
corresponding functions of a real variable. Where series expansions for real functions
f(x) exist, we can use as definition the series with x replaced by z.
Example 2. We define
From these we can show that ez = ex+i>> = ex(eos y + i sin y),
as well as numerous other relations.
286

CHAP. 13] 
COMPLEX VARIABLES AND CONFORMAL MAPPING 
287
Example 3. We define ab as eblno even when a and b are complex numbers. Since e2klrf = 1,
it follows that <?** = eK4>+ZM an<j we define In« = In (pe**) = In p + i(<f> + 2kv).
Thus In z is a many-valued function. 
The various single-valued functions of which
this many-valued function is composed are called its branches.
Rules for differentiating functions of a complex variable are much the same as for
those of real variables. Thus 
etc.
CAUCHY-RIEMANN EQUATIONS
A necessary condition that w = f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) be analytic in a region <K
is that u and v satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations
(2)
(see Problem 13.7). If the partial derivatives in (2) are continuous in <R, the equations are
sufficient conditions that f(z) be analytic in <^.
If the second derivatives of u and v with respect to x and y exist and are continuous,
we find by differentiating (2) that
(3)
Thus the real and imaginary parts satisfy Laplace's equation in two dimensions. Functions
satisfying Laplace's equation are called harmonic functions.
INTEGRALS
If f(z) is defined, single-valued and continuous in a region ^ we define the integral
of f(z) along some path C in ^ from point Zi to point zz, where Zi — Xi + iyi, z2 = xz + iy%, as
with this definition the integral of a function of a complex variable can be made to
depend on line integrals for real functions already considered in Chapter 6. An alterna-
tive definition based on the limit of a sum, as for functions of a real variable, can also
be formulated and turns out to be equivalent to the one above.
The rules for complex integration are similar to those for real integrals. An important
result is
(-4)
where M is an upper bound of |/(z)| on C, i.e. |/(z)| ^ M, and L is the length of the path C.
CAUCHY'S THEOREM
Let C be a simple closed curve. If /(z) is analytic within the region bounded by C
as well as on C, then we have Cauchy's theorem that
(5)
where the second integral emphasizes the fact that C is a simple closed curve.

288 
COMPLEX VARIABLES AND CONFORMAL MAPPING 
[CHAP.13
Expressed in another way, (5) is equivalent to the statement t h a t h a s a
value independent of the path joining Zi and z2. Such integrals can be evaluated as
F(zz) - F(ZI) where F'(z) = f(z). 
These results are similar to corresponding results for
line integrals developed in Chapter 6.
Example 4. Since f(z) = Zz is analytic everywhere, we have for any simple closed curve C
Also,
CAUCHY'S INTEGRAL FORMULAS
If f(z) is analytic within and on a simple closed curve C and a is any point interior
to C, then
(«)
where C is traversed in the positive (counterclockwise) sense.
Also, the %th derivative of f(z) at z = a is given by
(7)
These are called Cauchy's integral formulas. 
They are quite remarkable because
they show that if the function f(z) is known on the closed curve C then it is also known
within C, and the various derivatives at points within C can be calculated. Thus if a
function of a complex variable has a first derivative, it has all higher derivatives as well.
This of course is not necessarily true for functions of real variables.
TAYLOR'S SERIES
Let f(z) be analytic inside and on a circle having its center at z = a. Then for all
points z in the circle we have the Taylor series representation of f(z) given by
(*)
See Problem 13.21.
SINGULAR POINTS
A singular point of a function f(z) is a value of z at which f(z) fails to be analytic.
If f(z) is analytic everywhere in some region except at an interior point z = a, we call
z = a an isolated singularity of f(z).
Example 5. If 
then z = 3 is an isolated singularity of /(«).
POLES
If 
where <f>(z) is analytic everywhere in a region including
z = a, and if n is a positive integer, then f(z) has an isolated singularity at z = a which is
called a pole of order n. If n = 1, the pole is often called a simple pole; if n = 2 it is
called a double pole, etc.

CHAP. 13] 
COMPLEX VARIABLES AND CONFORMAL MAPPING 
289
Example 6. 
has two singularities: a pole of order 2 or double pole at
2 = 3, and a pole of order 1 or simple pole at z = —1.
Example 7. 
has two simple poles at z = ±2i.
A function can have other types of singularities besides poles. For example,
has a branch point at z = 0 (see Problem 13.36). The f u n c t i o n h a s a singularity
Ql fl 4J
at z = 0. However, due to the fact that lim —^— is finite, we call such a singularity a
removable singularity.
 
z~*
LAURENT'S SERIES
If /(z) has a pole of order n at z = a but is analytic at every other point inside and
on a circle C with center at a, then (z -a)nf(z) 
is analytic at all points inside and on C
and has a Taylor series about z = a so that
(9)
This is called a Laurent series for f(z). 
The part a0 + ai(z — a) + Oz(z — a)2 + • • • is called
the analytic part, while the remainder consisting of inverse powers of z — a is called the
00
principal part. More generally, we refer to the series 2 a*(z ~~ a)k as a Laurent series
fc=-oo
where the terms with k < 0 constitute the principal part. A function which is analytic
in a region bounded by two concentric circles having center at z = a can always be
expanded into such a Laurent series (see Problem 13.82).
It is possible to define various types of singularities of a function f(z) from its Laurent
series. For example, when the principal part of a Laurent series has a finite number of
terms and a-n¥= 0 while a-n-i, a-n-z, ... are all zero, then z = a is a pole of order n.
If the principal part has infinitely many terms, z = a is called an essential singularity or
sometimes a pole of infinite order.
Example 8. The function 
has an essential singularity at « = 0.
RESIDUES
The coefficients in (9) can be obtained in the customary manner by writing the coeffi-
cients for the Taylor series corresponding to (z — a)nf(z). 
In further developments, the
coefficient a-i, called the residue of /(z) at the pole z = a, is of considerable importance.
It can be found from the formula
(10)
where n is the order of the pole. For simple poles the calculation of the residue is of
particular simplicity since it reduces to
(11)
RESIDUE THEOREM
If /(z) is analytic in a region <R except for a pole of order n at z = a and if C is any
simple closed curve in <3{. containing z = a, then /(z) has the form (9). Integrating (9),
using the fact that

290 
COMPLEX VARIABLES AND CONFORMAL MAPPING 
[CHAP. 13
(12)
(see Problem 13.13), it follows that
(IS)
i.e. the integral of f(z) around a closed path enclosing a single pole of f(z) is 2?rt times
the residue at the pole.
More generally, we have the following important
Theorem 13.1. If f(z) is analytic within and on the boundary C of a region "K except at a
finite number of poles a, b, c, ... within "2^, having residues a-i, 6-1, c-i, ...
respectively, then
(**)
i.e. the integral of f(z) is 2id times the sum of the residues of f(z) at the
poles enclosed by C.
Cauchy's theorem and integral formulas are special cases of this result which we call the
residue theorem.
EVALUATION OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS
The evaluation of various definite integrals can often be achieved by using the residue
theorem together with a suitable function f(z) and a suitable path or contour C, the choice
of which may require great ingenuity. The following types are most common in practice.

CONFORMAL MAPPING
The analytic function w - f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) defines a transformation u - u(x, y),
v — v(x, y) which establishes a correspondence between points of the uv and xy planes.
Suppose that under this transformation point (xo,y<>) of the xy plane is mapped into
point (u0, v0) of the uv plane [see Figs. 13-1 and 13-2] while curves Ci and C2 [intersecting
at (x0,yo)] are mapped respectively into curves C{ and C2' [intersecting at (UO,VQ)]. Then if
the transformation is such that the angle at (xo,y0) between Ci and C2 is equal to the
angle at (uo,v<>) between Ci and C2' both in magnitude and sense, the transformation or
mapping is said to be conformal at (x0, yo). A mapping which preserves the magnitudes
of angles but not necessarily the sense is called isogonal.
Fig. 13-1 
Fig. 13-2
The following theorem is fundamental.
Theorem 13.2. 
If f(z) is analytic and f'(z) ¥= 0 in a region <K, then the mapping w = 
f(z)
is conformal at all points of "2^.
For conformal mappings or transformations, small figures in the neighborhood of a
point zo in the z plane map into similar small figures in the w plane and are magnified
[or reduced] by an amount given approximately by |/'(zo)|2, called the area magnification
factor or simply magnification factor. Short distances in the z plane in the neighborhood
of z0 are magnified [or reduced] in the w plane by an amount given approximately by
|/'(z0)|, called the linear magnification factor. Large figures in the z plane usually map
into figures in the w plane which are far from similar.
RIEMANN'S MAPPING THEOREM
Let C [Fig. 13-3] be a simple closed curve in the z plane forming the boundary of a
region •?(. Let C" [Fig. 13-4] be a circle of radius one and center at the origin [the unit circle]
forming the boundary of region 9^' in the w plane. The region It? is sometimes called
the unit disk. Then Riemann's mapping theorem states that there exists a function
w = f(z), analytic in ^, which maps each point of "^ into a corresponding point of "5^' and
each point of C into a corresponding point of C', the correspondence being one to one.

This function f(z) contains three arbitrary real constants which can be determined
by making the center of C' correspond to some given point in <2^ while some point on C'
corresponds to a given point on C. It should be noted that while Riemann's mapping
theorem demonstrates the existence of a mapping function, it does not actually produce
this function.
It is possible to extend Riemann's mapping theorem to the case where a region bounded
by two simple closed curves, one inside the other, is mapped into a region bounded by
two concentric circles.
SOME GENERAL TRANSFORMATIONS
In the following a, ft are given complex constants while a, Go are real constants.
1. Translation. 
w = z + $
By this transformation, figures in the z plane are displaced or translated in
the direction of vector /?.
2. Rotation. 
w = e
w<>z
By this transformation, figures in the z plane are rotated through an angle 0o.
If 0o > 0 the rotation is counterclockwise, while if 0o < 0 the rotation is clockwise.
3. Stretching. 
w = az
By this transformation, figures in the z plane are stretched (or contracted)
in the direction z if a > 1 (or 0 < a < 1). We consider contraction as a special
case of stretching.
4. Inversion. 
w = 1/z
5. Linear Transformation. 
w = az + ft
This is a combination of the transformations of translation, rotation and
stretching.
6. Bilinear or Fractional Transformation.
This is a combination of the transformations of translation, rotation, stretching
and inversion.
MAPPING OF A HALF PLANE ON TO A CIRCLE
Let z0 be any point P in the upper half of the z plane denoted by <•£ in Fig. 13-5 below.
Then the transformation
(15)
maps this upper half plane in a one to one manner on to the interior <K' of the unit circle
\w\ = 1, Fig. 13-6 below, and conversely. Each point of the x axis is mapped on to the
boundary of the circle. The constant 00 can be determined by making one particular point
of the x axis correspond to a given point on the circle.
In the above figures we have used the convention that unprimed points such as
A,B, C, etc., in the z plane correspond to primed points A',B', C', etc., in the w plane.
Also, in the case where points are at infinity we indicate this by an arrow such as at
A and F in Fig. 13-5 which correspond respectively to A' and F' (the same point) in
Fig. 13-6. As point z moves on the boundary of "2?. [i.e. the real axis] from —<» (point A)
to +00 (point F), w moves counterclockwise along the unit circle from A' back to A'.

The following facts should be noted:
1. Any three of the points Xi,x2, .. .,xn can be chosen at will.
2. The constants A and B determine the size, orientation and position of the polygon.
3. It is convenient to choose one point, say xn, at infinity in which case the last factor
of (16) and (17) involving xn is not present.
4. Infinite open polygons can be considered as limiting cases of closed polygons.
SOLUTIONS OF LAPLACE'S EQUATION BY CONFORMAL MAPPING
The problem of determining a function which is harmonic, i.e. satisfies Laplace's
equation, in some region ^ [Fig. 13-7] and which takes prescribed values on the boundary
C is often called a Dirichlet problem. It can often be solved by mapping ^ into the unit
circle or upper half plane. In such case C is mapped into a corresponding boundary C'
and boundary conditions on C are transformed into boundary conditions for C'. 
Since
Laplace's equation in ^ is transformed into Laplace's equation in <2?/ [see Problem 13.49],
the problem is thus reduced to solving Laplace's equation in ^' with boundary conditions
on C", which is generally simple to do. By then transforming back we obtain the required
solution.
For illustrations of the procedure see Problems 13.51-13.54.

counterclockwise along the circle \z\ = 1. Show that when it has returned to its
starting position for the first time its image point has not yet returned, but that when

Let z = e™. Then w = Vz = e®'2. Let * = 0 correspond to the starting position. Then

When one complete revolution in the z plane has been made, 9 = Zir, z = 1 but w = ei9lz =

However, after two complete revolutions in the z plane have been made, e = 4ir, z = 1 and
w = ei6'2 = e
2™ = 1 so the image point has returned for the first time.
It follows from the above that w is not a single-valued function of « but is a double-valued
function of z; i.e. given z, there are two values of w. If we wish to consider it a single-valued
function, we must restrict e. We can, for example, choose 0 S e < 2v, although other possibilities
exist. This represents one branch of the double-valued function w = Vz. In continuing beyond
this interval we are on the second branch, e.g. 2jr S 8 < 4jr. The point z = 0 about which the
rotation is taking place is called a branch point. Equivalently, we can insure that /(«) = Viz

13.38. Consider the transformation w = f(z) 
where f(z) is analytic at z0 and /'(«<>) ^ 0.
Prove that under this transformation the tangent at z0 to any curve C in the z plane
passing through z0 [Fig. 13-23] is rotated through the angle arg/'(zo).

Fig. 13-24
As a point moves from z0 to z0 + Az along C [Fig. 13-23] the image point moves along C' in the
w plane [Fig. 13-24] from w0 to t00 + Aw. If the parameter used to describe the curve is t, then
corresponding to the path z — z(t) [or x = x(t), y = y(t)] in the z plane, we have the path w = w(t)
[or u = u(t), v = v(t)] in the w plane.
The derivatives dz/dt and dw/dt represent tangent vectors to corresponding points on C and C'.

13.39. Prove that the angle between two curves Ci and Cz passing through the point z<> in
the z plane [see Figs. 13-1 and 13-2, page 291] is preserved [in magnitude and sense]
under the transformation w = f(z), i.e. the mapping is conformal, if f(z) is analytic
at 20 and f'(z0) *£ 0.
By Problem 13.38 each curve is rotated through the angle arg /'(z0). Hence the angle between
the curves must be preserved, both in magnitude and sense, in the mapping.

We must show that the mapping function obtained from

maps a given polygon of the w plane [Fig. 13-26] into the real axis of the z plane [Fig. 13-27].
To show this observe that from (1) we have
W
As z moves along the real axis from the left toward xlt let us assume that w moves along a side
of the polygon toward wt. When z crosses from the left of x^ to the right of xv el — arg (z — xt)
changes from JT to 0 while all other terms in (2) stay constant. 
Hence axgdw decreases by

It follows from this that the direction through wt turns through the angle v — alt and thus w
now moves along the side w^w^ of the polygon.
When z moves through xz> ei — ar& (z ~ *i) an^ *2 — arS (g ~ #2) change from v to 0 while
all other terms stay constant. Hence another turn through angle TT — <*2 in *he w plane is made.
By continuing the process we see that as z traverses the x axis, w traverses the polygon, and
conversely.
We can prove that the interior of the polygon (if it is closed) is mapped on to the upper
half plane by (1).
13.43. Prove that for closed polygons the sum of the exponents

The sum of the exterior angles of any closed polygon is 2jr. Then

Let points P,Q,S and T [Fig. 13-28] map respectively into P',Q',S' and 2" [Fig. 13-29].
We can consider PQST as a limiting case of a polygon (a triangle) with two vertices at Q and
S and the third vertex P or T at infinity.
By the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation, since the angles at Q and S are equal to w/2,
we have
Integrating,
When g = l, w = b. 
Hence

When z = -l,w = -b. 
Hence,

Solving (1) and (2) simultaneously, we find B = 0, K = 2b/v. Then

13.50. If a is real, show that the real and imaginary parts of w = In(2-a) are harmonic
functions in any region ^ not containing z = a.
Method 1. If 'R, does not contain a, then w = In (z — a) is analytic in <^. Hence the real and
imaginary parts are harmonic in «£.
Method 2. Let z — a — reie. Then if principal values are used for 9, w — u + iv = ln(z — a) =
In r + ie so that u = In r, v = 6.
In the polar coordinates (r, e), Laplace's equation is 
and by direct
substitution we find that u = In r and v = e are solutions if ^. does not contain r = 0, i.e.
z — a.
Method 3. If z — a = rete, then x — a = r cos 6, y = r sin e and
r - V(* - «)2 + V2,

Then w — u + iv = £ In {(x — a)2 + y2} + i tan"1 {y/(x — a)} and u = £ In {(x — a)2 + y2}, v —

T2 = A(0) + B(0) + C 
(2) Tt = A(0) + B(v) + C

This is a Dirichlet problem for the unit circle [Fig. 13-32] in which we seek a function satisfying
Laplace's equation inside |z| = 1 and taking the values 0 on arc ABC and 1 on arc CDE.
Fig. 13-32 
Fig. 13-33
We map the interior of the circle |«| = 1 on to the upper half of the w plane [Fig. 13-33] by
using the mapping f u n c t i o n o r o b t a i n e d by using (15), page 292, with
w and z interchanged.
Under this transformation, arcs ABC and CDE are mapped on to the negative and positive real
axis A'B'C' and C'D'E' respectively of the w plane. Then the boundary conditions * = 0 on
arc ABC and * = 1 on arc CDE become respectively # = 0 on A'B'C' and 
<J> = 1 on C'D'E'.

THE COMPLEX INVERSION FORMULA
If F(s) = £ {/(*)}, then £-* (F(s)} is given by
(*)
and f(t) = 0 for t < 0. This result is called the complex inversion integral or formula. It
is also known as Bromwich's integral formula. The result provides a direct means for
obtaining the inverse Laplace transform of a given function F(s).
The integration in (1) is to be performed along a line s = y + iy in the complex plane
where s = x + iy. The real number y is chosen so that s = y lies to the right of all the
singularities (poles, branch points or essential singularities) but is otherwise arbitrary.
THE BROMWICH CONTOUR
In practice, the integral in (1) is evaluated
by considering the contour integral
(*)
where C is the contour of Fig. 14-1. 
This con-
tour, sometimes called the Bromwich contour,
is composed of line AB and the arc BJKLA of
a circle of radius R with center at the origin O.
If we represent arc BJKLA by r, it follows
from (1) that since T = -\/R" — y2,

USE OF RESIDUE THEOREM IN FINDING INVERSE LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
Suppose that the only singularities of F(s) are poles all of which lie to the left of the
line s = y for some real constant y. Suppose further that the integral around r in (5)
approaches zero as /?-*<». Then by the residue theorem we can write (3) as
/(*) = 
sum of residues of est F(s) at poles of F(s)
= 2 residues of estF(s) at poles of F(s)

A SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR THE INTEGRAL AROUND r
TO APPROACH ZERO
The validity of the result (4) hinges on the assumption that the integral around r in (3)
approaches zero as R-* °°. A sufficient condition under which this assumption is correct
is supplied in the following
Theorem 14-1. If we can find constants M > 0, k > 0 such that on r (where s = Re19),
(5)
then the integral around r of estF(s) approaches zero as R-*•<*>, i.e.,
(*)
The condition (5) always holds if F(s) = P(s)/Q(s) where P(s) and Q(s) are polynomials
and the degree of P(s) is less than the degree of Q(s).
The result is valid even if F(s) has other singularities besides poles.
MODIFICATION OF BROMWICH CONTOUR
IN CASE OF BRANCH POINTS
If F(s) has branch points, extensions of the
above results can be made provided that the
Bromwich contour is suitably modified. 
For
example, if F(s) has only one branch point at
s = 0, then we can use the contour of Fig. 14-2.
In this figure, BDE and LNA represent arcs of
a circle of radius R with center at origin O,
while HJK is the arc of a circle of radius e with
center at 0. For details of evaluating inverse
Laplace transforms in such cases see Prob. 14.9. 
Fig. 14-2
CASE OF INFINITELY MANY SINGULARITIES
If we wish to find the inverse Laplace transform of functions which have infinitely
many isolated singularities, the above methods can be applied. In such case the curved
portion of the Bromwich contour is chosen to be of such radius Rm so as to enclose only a
finite number of the singularities and so as not to pass through any singularity. 
The
required inverse Laplace transform is then found by taking an appropriate limit as m-*•<*>.
See Problems 14.13 and 14.14.
APPLICATIONS TO BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEMS
The method of Laplace transforms combined with the complex inversion formula pro-
vide powerful tools in the solution of various boundary-value problems arising in science
and engineering. See Problems 14.15-14.19.

THE COMPLEX INVERSION FORMULA
14.1. Establish the validity of the complex inversion formula.
We have, by definition, 
Then
Letting s = y + iy, ds = i dy, this becomes
by Fourier's integral theorem [see Chapter 8]. Thus we find
as required.
In the above proof, we assume that e~yuf(u) 
is absolutely integrable in (0,«°), i.e.
converges, so that Fourier's integral theorem can be applied. 
To insure this
condition it is sufficient that f(t) be of exponential order y where the real number y is chosen so that
the line # = y in the complex plane lies to the right of all the singularities of F(s). Except for
this condition, y is otherwise arbitrary.
14.2. Let r denote the curved portion BJPKQLA
of the Bromwich contour [Fig. 14-3] with
equation s = Rew, 00 S= 6 S= 2ir — 00, i.e. r is
the arc of a circle of radius R with center
at O. Suppose that on r we have

where we have used the given condition \F(s)\ § M/Rk on rt and the transformation e = ir/2 — $
where 00 = ir/2 — 00 = sin"1 (y/R).
Since sin <f> S sin <f>0 S cos «0 = y/R, this last integral is less than or equal to
But as R-*<*>, this last quantity approaches zero [as can be seen by noting, for example, that
sin-1 (y/R) ~ y/R for large R], 
Thus lim 7X = 0.

Case 2. Integral over T2 or JPK.
Along T2 we have, since s = Rew, ir/2 £ e S v,
Then, as in Case 1, we have
upon letting 0 = v/2 + <f>.
Now sin 0 S 2<f>/ir for 0 S <f> S ir/2 [see Problem 14.3], so that the last integral is less than

By the residue theorem,

Since the only singularity s = 0 of the integrand is not inside C, the integral on the left is zero
by Cauchy's theorem. Also, the integrand satisfies the condition of Problem 14.2 so that on taking

DEFINITION OF A MATRIX
A matrix of order m x n, or m by n matrix, is a rectangular array of numbers having
m rows and n columns. It can be written in the form
(1)
Each number ajk in this matrix is called an element. The subscripts j and k indicate
respectively the row and column of the matrix in which the element appears.
We shall often denote a matrix by a letter, such as A in (1), or by the symbol (a^) which
shows a representative element.
A matrix having only one row is called a row matrix [or row vector] while a matrix
having only one column is called a column matrix [or column vector]. If the number of
rows m and columns n are equal the matrix is called a square matrix of order n x n or
briefly n. A matrix is said to be a real matrix or complex matrix according as its elements
are real or complex numbers.
SOME SPECIAL DEFINITIONS AND OPERATIONS INVOLVING MATRICES
1. Equality of Matrices. Two matrices A = (ajk) and B = (bik) of the same order [i.e.
equal numbers of rows and columns] are equal if and only if aik = bik.
2. Addition of Matrices. If A = (aik) and B = (bjk) have the same order we define the
sum of A and B as A + B = (aik + bjk).
Example 1. If 
then
Note that the commutative and associative laws for addition are satisfied by
matrices, i.e. for any matrices A, B, C of the same order
A + B = B + A, 
A + (B + C) = (A +B) + C 
(2)
3. Subtraction of Matrices. If A = (a}k), B = (bik) have the same order, we define the
difference of A and B as A - B = (ajk - bik).
Example 2. If A and B are the matrices of Example 1, then

MATRICES 
343
4. Multiplication of a Matrix by a Number. If A - (aik) and X is any number [or scalar],
we define the product of A by A. as XA = A\ = (Attjic).
Example 3. If A is the matrix of Example 1 and X = 4, then
5. Multiplication of Matrices. If A = (ajfc) is an mxn matrix while B = (&#) is an
nxp matrix, then we define the product A-B or AB of A and 5 as the matrix
C = (Cjk) where
(3)
and where C is of order mxp.
Note that matrix multiplication is defined if and only if the number of columns of
A is the same as the number of rows of B. 
Such matrices are sometimes called
conformable.
Example 4. Let 
Then
Note that in general AB ¥* BA, i.e. the commutative law for multiplication of
matrices is not satisfied in general. However, the associative and distributive laws
are satisfied, i.e.
A(BC) = (AB)C, 
A(B + C) = AB + AC, 
(B + C)A = BA + CA 
(4)
A matrix A can be multiplied by itself if and only if it is a square matrix. The
product A - A can in such case be written A2. Similarly we define powers of a square
matrix, i.e. A3 = A'A2, A4 = A«A3, etc.
6. Transpose of a Matrix. 
If we interchange rows and columns of a matrix A, the
resulting matrix is called the transpose of A and is denoted by AT. In symbols, if
A = (ajfc) then AT = (akj).
Example 5. The transpose of 
is
We can prove that

1. Symmetric and Skew-Symmetric Matrices. A square matrix A is called symmetric if
AT — A and skew-symmetric if AT = —A.
Example 6. The matrix 
is symmetric while 
is skew-symmetric.
Any real square matrix [i.e. one having only real elements] can always be expressed
as the sum of a real symmetric matrix and a real skew-symmetric matrix.

MATRICES 
[CHAP. 15
8. Complex Conjugate of a Matrix. 
If all elements ajk of a matrix A are replaced by
their complex conjugates aik, the matrix obtained is called the complex conjugate of A
and is denoted by A. 
.
9. Hermitian and Skew-Hermitian Matrices. A square matrix A which is the same as
the complex conjugate of its transpose, i.e. if A = AT, is called Hermitian. If
A = —AT, then A is called skew-Hermitian. If A is real these reduce to symmetric
and skew-symmetric matrices respectively.
10. Principal Diagonal and Trace of a Matrix. If A = (aik) is a square matrix, then the
diagonal which contains all elements ajk for which j = k is called the principal or
main diagonal and the sum of all such elements is called the trace of A,
Example 7. The principal or main diagonal of the matrix
is indicated by the shading, and the trace of the matrix is 5 + 1 + 2 = 8.
A matrix for which ajk = 0 when j ¥= k is called a diagonal matrix.
11. Unit Matrix. A square matrix in which all elements of the principal diagonal are
equal to 1 while all other elements are zero is called the unit matrix and is denoted by
/. An important property of 7 is that
AI •= IA = A, 
I* = I, % = 1,2,3, ... 
(6)
The unit matrix plays a role in matrix algebra similar to that played by the
number one in ordinary algebra.
12. Zero or Null Matrix. A matrix whose elements are all equal to zero is called the
null or zero matrix and is often denoted by O or simply 0. For any matrix A having
the same order as 0 we have
A + 0 = 0 + A=A 
(7)
Also if A and 0 are square matrices, then
AO = OA = 0 
(8)
The zero matrix plays a role in matrix algebra similar to that played by the number
zero of ordinary algebra.
DETERMINANTS
If the matrix A in (1) is a square matrix, then we associate with A a number denoted by
W
called the determinant of A of order n, written det (A). In order to define the value of a
determinant, we introduce the following concepts.
1. Minor. Given any element ajk of A we associate a new determinant of order (n — 1)
obtained by removing all elements of the jth row and Mh column called the minor of ajk.

CHAP. 15] 
MATRICES 
345
Example 8. The minor corresponding to the element 5 in the 2nd row and 3rd column of the
fourth order determinant
which is obtained by removing the elements shown shaded.
2. Cofactor. 
If we multiply the minor of ajfc by (-l)'+k, the result is called the coj'actor
of cijk and is denoted by A}k.
Example 9. The cofactor corresponding to the element 5 in the determinant of Example 8 is
(—l)2+s times its minor, or
The value of a determinant is then defined as the sum of the products of the elements
in any row [or column] by their corresponding cofactors and is called the Laplace expansion.
In symbols,
(10)
We can show that this value is independent of the row [or column] used [see Problem 15.7],
THEOREMS ON DETERMINANTS
Theorem 15-L The value of a determinant remains the same if rows and columns are
interchanged. In symbols, det (A) = det (AT).
Theorem 15-2. If all elements of any row [or column] are zero except for one element, then
the value of the determinant is equal to the product of that element by its
cofactor. In particular, if all elements of a row [or column] are zero the
determinant is zero.
Theorem 15-3. An interchange of any two rows [or columns] changes the sign of the
determinant.
Theorem 15-4. If all elements in any row [or column] are multiplied by a number, the
determinant is also multiplied by this number.
Theorem 15-5. If any two rows [or columns] are the same or proportional, the determinant
is zero.
Theorem 15-6. If we express the elements of each row [or column] as the sum of two terms,
then the determinant can be expressed as the sum of two determinants
having the same order.
Theorem 15-7. If we multiply the elements of any row [or column] by a given number and
add to corresponding elements of any other row [or column], then the value
of the determinant remains the same.
Theorem 15-8. If A and B are square matrices of the same order, then
det (AS) = det (A) det (B) 
(11)

346 
MATRICES 
[CHAP. 15
Theorem 15-9. The sum of the products of the elements of any row [or column] by the
cofactors of another row [or column] is zero. In symbols,
(12)
If p = q, the sum is det (A) by (10).
Theorem 15-10. Let v\, v2,..., vn represent row vectors [or column vectors] of a square
matrix A of order n. Then det (A) - 0 if and only if there exist constants
[scalars] Ai, A2, ..., \n not all zero such that
(13)
where O is the null or zero row matrix. If condition (13) is satisfied we
say that the vectors v\, Vz,..., vn are linearly dependent. Otherwise they
are linearly independent. A matrix A such that det (A) = 0 is called a
singular matrix. If det (A) ¥° 0, then A is a non-singular matrix.
In practice we evaluate a determinant of order n by using Theorem 15-7 successively
to replace all but one of the elements in a row or column by zeros and then using Theorem
15-2 to obtain a new determinant of order » —1. We continue in this manner, arriving
ultimately at determinants of orders 2 or 3 which are easily evaluated.
INVERSE OF A MATRIX
If for a given square matrix A there exists a matrix B such that AB — I, then B is
called an inverse of A and is denoted by A"1. The following theorem is fundamental.
Theorem 15-11. If A is a non-singular square matrix of order n [i.e. det(A)^0], then
there exists a unique inverse A"1 such that AA"1 = A"1 A = 7 and we
can express A"1 in the following form
(U)
where (Ajk) is the matrix of cofactors ASk and 
(Ajfc)
T = (Aki) 
is its
transpose.
The following express some properties of the inverse:
(15)
ORTHOGONAL AND UNITARY MATRICES
A real matrix A is called an orthogonal matrix if its transpose is the same as its
inverse, i.e. if AT = A"1 or ATA = 7.
A complex matrix A is called a unitary matrix if its complex conjugate transpose is
the same as its inverse, i.e. if AT = A"1 or ATA = 7. It should be noted that a real
unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix.
ORTHOGONAL VECTORS
In Chapter 5 we found that the scalar or dot product of two vectors ad + a2j + ask and
&ii + &2J + &sk is ai&i + tt2&2 + as&s and that the vectors are perpendicular or orthogonal if
«i&i + oz&2 + a3&s = 0. From the point of view of matrices we can consider these vectors
as column vectors

CHAP. 15] 
MATRICES 
347
from which it follows that
This leads us to define the scalar product of real column vectors A and B as ATB and to
define A and B to be orthogonal if ATB = 0.
It is convenient to generalize this to cases where the vectors can have complex com-
ponents and we adopt the following definition:
Definition 1. Two column vectors A and B are called orthogonal if ATB = 0, and ATB
is called the scalar product of A and B.
It should be noted also that if A is a unitary matrix then ATA = 1, which means that the
scalar product of A with itself is 1 or equivalently A is a unit vector, i.e. having length 1.
Thus a unitary column vector is a unit vector. Because of these remarks we have the
following
Definition 2. A set of vectors Xi, X2, ... for which
is called a unitary set or system of vectors or, in the case where the vectors
are real, an orthonormal set or an orthogonal set of unit vectors.
SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS
A set of equations having the form
(16)
is called a system of m linear equations in the n unknowns x\,xz,...,xn. If r\,r2,...,rn
are all zero the system is called homogeneous. If they are not all zero it is called non-
homogeneous. Any set of numbers x\,xz, ...,%«. which satisfies (16) is called a solution of
the system.
In matrix form (16) can be written
(17)
or more briefly 
(18)
where A,X,R represent the corresponding matrices in (17).
SYSTEMS OF n EQUATIONS IN n UNKNOWNS. CRAMER'S RULE
If m = n and if A is a non-singular matrix so that A"1 exists, we can solve (17) or
(18) by writing
(iy)
and the system has a unique solution.

348 
MATRICES 
[CHAP. 15
Alternatively we can express the unknowns x\,xz,.. .,xn as
(20)
where 
called the determinant of the system, is given by (9) and Afc,
k = 1,2, ..., n is the determinant obtained from A by removing the fcth column and
replacing it by the column vector R. The rule expressed in (20) is called Cramer's rule.
The following four cases can arise.
Case 1, 
In this case there will be a unique solution where not all x* will
be zero.
Case 2, 
In this case the only solution will be x\ = 0, x% = 0, ..., xn = 0,
i.e. X = 0. This is often called the trivial solution.
Case 3, A = 0, R = 0. In this case there will be infinitely many solutions other than
the trivial solution. This means that at least one of the equations can be obtained
from the others, i.e. the equations are linearly dependent.
Case 4, A = 0, R ¥* 0. 
In this case infinitely many solutions will exist if and only if all
of the determinants Afe in (20) are zero. Otherwise there will be no solution.
The cases where m ¥* n are considered in Problems 15.93-15.96.
EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS
Let A = (Ojk) be an n x n matrix and X a column vector. The equation
AX = AX 
(21)
where A is a number can be written as
(22)
or
(23)
The equation (23) will have non-trivial solutions if and only if
(24)
which is a polynomial equation of degree n in A. The roots of this polynomial equation are
called eigenvalues or characteristic values of the matrix A. Corresponding to each eigen-
value there will be a solution X ¥* 0, i.e. a non-trivial solution, which is called an eigen-
vector or characteristic vector belonging to the eigenvalue. The equation (24) can also
be written
det(A-A7) = 0 
(25)
and the equation in A is often called the characteristic equation.

THEOREMS ON EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS
Theorem 15-12. The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix [or symmetric real matrix] are
real. The eigenvalues of a skew-Hermitian matrix [or skew-symmetric
real matrix] are zero or pure imaginary. The eigenvalues of a unitary
[or real orthogonal matrix] all have absolute value equal to 1.
Theorem 15-13. The eigenvectors belonging to different eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix
[or symmetric real matrix] are orthogonal.
Theorem 15-14 [Cayley-Hamilton]. A matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation
[see Problem 15.40].
Theorem 15-15 [Reduction of matrix to diagonal form]. If a non-singular matrix A has
distinct eigenvalues Xi, A2, A.S, ... with corresponding eigenvectors written
as columns in the matrix
then
i.e. B~1AB, called the transform of A by B, is a diagonal matrix containing
the eigenvalues of A in the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. We say
that A has been transformed or reduced to diagonal form. See Problem
15.41.
Theorem 15-16 [Reduction of quadratic form to canonical form].
Let A be a symmetric real matrix, for example,
Then if , we obtain the quadratic form
The cross product terms of this quadratic form can be removed by letting X = BU
where U is the column vector with elements u\, u2, u3 and B is an orthogonal matrix which
diagonalizes A. The new quadratic form in u\, Uz, u3 with no cross product terms is called
the canonical form. See Problem 15.43. A generalization can be made to Hermitian quad-
ratic forms [see Problem 15.114].
OPERATOR INTERPRETATION OF MATRICES
If A is an n x n matrix, we can think of it as an operator or transformation acting on a
column vector X to produce AX which is another column vector. With this interpretation
equation (21) asks for those vectors X which are transformed by A into constant multiples
of themselves [or equivalently into vectors which have the same direction but possibly
different magnitude].
Then if x

MATRICES 
[CHAP. 15
If case A is an orthogonal matrix, the transformation is a rotation and explains why
the absolute value of all the eigenvalues in such case are equal to one [Theorem 15-12], since
an ordinary rotation of a vector would not change its magnitude.
The ideas of transformation are very convenient in giving interpretations to many
properties of matrices.

15.7. Prove that the value of a determinant remains the same regardless of which row [or

Consider the determinant A = (ajk) of order n. The result is true for n = 2 by Problem 15.6.
We use proof by induction, i.e. assuming it to be true for order n — 1 we shall prove it true for
order n. The plan will be to expand A using two different rows p and q and show that the expan-
sions are the same.
Let us first expand A by elements in the pth row. Then a typical term in the expansion is
(1)
where Mpk is the minor corresponding to the cofactor Apk of Oj,k. Since this minor is of order
n — 1, any row can be used in its expansion.
We shall use the qth row where we assume that q > p since a similar argument holds if
q < p. This row consists of elements aqr where r ¥= k and corresponds to the (q — l)st row of Mpk.
Now if r < k, aqr is located in the rth column of Mpk so that in the expansion the term corre-
sponding to aqr is
(2)
where Mpkqr is the minor corresponding to the element aqr in Mpk. From (1) and (2) it follows that
a typical term in the expansion of A is
(»)
If r > k then aqr is located in the (r — l)st column and so there is an additional minus sign in (3).
If we now expand A by elements in the qih row, a typical term is
(4)
We can expand Mqr by elements in the pth row where p > q. As before if k> r, a typical term
in the expansion of Mqr is
(5)
From (4) and (5) we see that a typical term in the expansion of A is
(«)
which is the same as (3). If k < r an additional minus sign appears in (6), agreeing with the
case corresponding to r > k using the first expansion. Thus the required result is proved.
In a similar manner we can prove that expansion by columns is the same and gives the same
result as the expansion by rows [Theorem 15-1, page 345].

(a) If two rows have the same elements, then the value of the determinant will not change if the

Since A A ~ 1 = I, det (A A -') = det (/) = !. But by Theorem 15-8, det (A A ~») = det (A) det (A -').

If A is orthogonal, then ATA = I so that by Theorem 15-8, page 345,
det (A^A) = det (AT) det (A) = det/ = 1

But det(AT) = det (A) so that (1) becomes
[det (A)]* = 1

det (A) = ±1
15.24. Show that the vectors

Since the vectors are real, we must show that
If j = k = 1, we

Similarly we find if j — k = 2 and j = k — 3, A2A2 = 1, A3A3 = 1. Thus A1(A2,As are unit
vectors.
To show the orthogonality of any two of the vectors consider, for example, j = 1, k = 2.
Then we have

Similarly A1A3 = 0, A2A3 = 0 and so the vectors are mutually orthogonal.

On multiplying the first equation by 2, the second by 3 and adding, we obtain the third

Geometrically the planes represented by the first two equations intersect in a line. The plane

Calculus of Variations
MAXIMUM OR MINIMUM OF AN INTEGRAL
One of the main problems of the calculus of variations is to determine that curve con-
necting two given points which either minimizes or maximizes some given integral. For
example, the problem of determining that curve connecting two points (#1,2/1) and (#2,2/2)
whose length is a minimum is the same as that of finding the curve Y = y(x) where
2/(#i) = 2/1, 2/(#2) = 2/2 such that
W
is a minimum.
In the general case we want to find the curve Y = y(x) where y(xi) = y\, y(x£) = 2/2
such that for some given function F(x, y, y'),
(2)
is either a maximum or minimum, also called an extremum or stationary value. A curve
which satisfies this property is called an extremal. An integral such as (2) which assumes
a numerical value for some class of functions y(x) is often called a functional.
EULER'S EQUATION
In order to find the required curve Y — y(x), we
consider the effect on the integral (2) of neighboring
curves [see Fig. 16-1]
(3)
where i)(x) is an arbitrary function and e is an arbi-
trary parameter. In order for the curve (3) to pass
through (xi, 2/1) and (xz, 1/2), we require that
W
We can show [see Problems 16.1 and 16.2] that the
required curve Y - y(x) satisfies the equation 
Fig.l6-l
(5)
which is called Euler's equation. The condition (5) is a necessary condition for y = y(x)
to be an extremal but it is not a sufficient condition.
In case F(x,y,y') does not contain x explicitly, a first integral of (5) is found to be
[see Problem 16.4]

CONSTRAINTS
In certain problems we want to find that curve which makes a given integral
(7)
a maximum or minimum but at the same time keeps the integral
(*)
equal to some constant. This type of problem in the calculus of variations is one which
involves a constraint condition, namely that the integral (8) is a constant. A special case
of this is the problem of determining that curve having a given perimeter which encloses
the largest area [Problem 16.8]. Because of this special case, we often refer to this class
of problems as isoperimetric problems.
Such problems can generally be solved by using the method of Lagrange multipliers.
To do this we consider the integral formed by adding (7) to A. multiplied by (8), whose A. is
the Lagrange multiplier. The resulting integral given by
(9)
must be an extremum and leads to the Euler equation
where 
(10)
Using this we can find the required extremal. Extensions can be made to cases where there
are more constraint conditions.
THE VARIATIONAL NOTATION
It is often convenient to use a variational symbol 8 having properties which are in many
ways analogous to the differential d of the calculus.
Given a function F(x, y(x), y'(x)), or briefly F(x,y,y') where we consider x as fixed,
we define
(11)
where « and 17 = rj(x) 
have the same meaning given on page 375. Using the Taylor
expansion
(12)
(11) can be written
(IS)
The sum of the first two terms on the right of (13) is denoted by 8F called the variation
of F, i.e.
(U)
If in particular F = y or F = y' in (14), we have
(15)
so that (14) can be written
(16)

CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS 
377
From (15) we see that

i.e. 
(18)
showing that the operators 8 and d/dx are commutative.
The variational symbol and its properties provide approaches alternative to those
involving t and r)(x) for dealing with problems of finding extrema of integrals. Thus we
can show for example that a necessary condition for the integral (2) to be an extremum is
(19)
which in turn leads to the Euler equation. See Problem 16.11.
GENERALIZATIONS
The ideas above can be extended. An example is the problem of finding curves
Xi = Xi(t), Xz = xz(t), ..., Xn = xn(t) such that using Xi = dxi/dt, ..., xn = dxjdt,
(20)
is a maximum or minimum. A necessary condition for this is that the Euler equations
(21)
are satisfied. A solution of these equations leads to the required curves. See Problem 16.12.
Generalizations to cases where there are constraints are also possible. See Problem 16.13.
It is also possible to generalize to cases where multiple integrals are used rather than
single integrals, and also where endpoints may not be fixed. See Problems 16.14-16.16.
HAMILTON'S PRINCIPLE
According to Newton's laws, a particle of mass m moves in a path according to the
equation
(22)
where F is the external force acting on the particle, r is the position vector with respect to
the origin of some fixed coordinate system, and * is the time.
Now if the force field is conservative, then there exists a potential function V such that
(23)
The kinetic energy of the particle is defined as
(24)
if r = xi + yj + zk.

378
CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS
[CHAP. 16
We can then show that equation (22) follows as a consequence of the problem of finding
the path of the particle such that the integral
(25)
is an extremum, actually a minimum. In this integral ti and fe are two specified times and
the path is required to join the positions of the particles at these times.
The principle that a particle moves in such a way that (25) is a minimum is often called
Hamilton's principle. It can be generalized to systems of two or more particles.
LAGRANGE'S EQUATIONS
Very often in practice the position of a particle at any time can be described by a certain
minimum number of variables called generalized coordinates. For example, if we consider
the pendulum bob of a pendulum to be a point mass [Fig. 16-2] then its position is defined
by using the generalized coordinate 0 given by the angle made between the pendulum rod
and the vertical.
Fig. 16-2 
Fig. 16-3
Similarly in the case of a double pendulum with two masses mi, mz, as in Fig. 16-3, the
positions are specified by using two angles 9i, 02 which are the generalized coordinates.
The potential and kinetic energy can be expressed in terms of these generalized
coordinates which are often denoted by q\, QZ, ...,QN. The number N of required coordinates
is often called the number of degrees of freedom of the system.
According to Hamilton's principle the system moves so that
(26)
is an extremum where 
(27)
is called the Lagrangian of the system. Euler's equations then become
(28)
which are then called Lagrange's equations. From these equations the motion of the
system can be obtained.
STURM-LIOUVILLE SYSTEMS AND RAYLEIGH-RITZ METHODS
The calculus of variations often provides important methods for solving boundary-
value problems. For example, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Sturm-Liouville

functionals.

variational principles are called Rayleigh-Ritz methods. See Problems 16.22-16.25.

with soap films which are known to take shapes having minimum surfaces.

HAMILTON'S PRINCIPLE AND LAGRANGE'S EQUATIONS

Assume the n particles have masses mk, k = 1,2, ..., n, that they have position vectors rk,

Fk, k = 1,2, ..., n. Then the path Ck of the fcth particle is determined from the equation

which is Hamilton's principle, i.e. a system moves from time ti to time tz in such a way that

16.18. Derive Lagrange's equations from Hamilton's principle.
If the generalized coordinates specifying the position of a body are given by qltq%, ...,q$,
then the position vector rfc of each particle of the body is a function of qit q%, .. •, q^ so that its
velocity rfc = dik/dt is a function of qi,qz, •••»q

is a function of qlt qz,..., qN, glf qz, .. •, ?N- Also the potential energy, which we shall assume
depends only on position, is a function of <?i, q% 
qN.
Now by Hamilton's principle the body moves so that
is an extremum. Thus by Euler's equations we have on writing L = T — V, called the Lagrangian,
k = l,...,N
which are often also referred to as Lagrange's equations.

Problem 16.23 with x^ = a, x2 = b shows that we can find the eigenfunctions of the Sturm-
Liouville equation by determining the non-trivial functions y(x) which satisfy the conditions
«i2/(«) + <*22/'(a) — 0, bjy(b) + b2y'(b) = 0 and which make the ratio X = 113 an extremum.

Assume that
