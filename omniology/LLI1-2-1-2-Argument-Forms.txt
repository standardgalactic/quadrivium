§2-1-2 Argument Forms, Instances, and Soundness
Jen Davoren

Argument Forms
The following arguments share a “shape” or a “form”, and their
validity is due to the validity of their common argument form.
If genetics determines all our behaviour
if p,
then people don’t have free choice.
then q
People do have free choice.
not q.
Therefore, genetics doesn’t determine all our behaviour.
∴not p.
If living expenses in this city are high,
if p,
then many students are struggling financially.
then q.
Not many students are struggling financially
not q.
Therefore, living expenses in this city are not high.
∴not p.

Multiple forms
An argument can be an instance of multiple different forms.
The two arguments on the previous slide can considered
instances of other very different, argument forms, such as:
If p then q.
r.
Therefore, s.

Question: What is wrong with this argument form, just from
looking at it?

Invalid forms
Here’s an instance of an invalid argument of this form:
If you are a logician, then you are a geek.
Greenhouse gas levels have increased.
Therefore, the earth is flat.

Invalid forms
Here’s an instance of an invalid argument of this form:
If p, then you are a geek.
Greenhouse gas levels have increased.
Therefore, the earth is flat.

Exercise: extracting argument form
We can conclude that the people will be unhappy.
This is because either the government will increase the tax rate or it won’t.
If it does, the people will have less income to spend and they will be unhappy.
If it doesn’t, there will be fewer public services and the people will be unhappy.
Which is the best choice of argument form for this concrete argument?
(a)
p
q ∨r
q ⊃(s & p)
∴r ⊃(t & p)
(b)
q ∨r
q ⊃(s & p)
r ⊃(t & p)
∴p
(c)
q ∨∼q
q ⊃(s & p)
∼q ⊃(t & p)
∴p
(d)
p
q ∨∼q
q ⊃(s & p)
∴∼q ⊃(t & p)

Exercise Solution: extracting argument form
p :
The people will be unhappy.
q :
The government will increase the tax rate.
∼q :
The government won’t increase the tax rate.
s :
The people will have less income to spend.
t :
There will be fewer public services.
The best choice of argument form:
(c)
q ∨∼q
q ⊃(s & p)
∼q ⊃(t & p)
∴p

Is Validity of Arguments Enough?
(Premise)
If living expenses in this city are high,
then many students are struggling financially.
(Premise)
Not many students are struggling financially.
(Conclusion)
Hence, living expenses in this city are not high.
Question: This argument is valid – so why is there still something
wrong with it?

Soundness of arguments
An argument is sound if and only if it is an
instance of a valid argument form, and in
addition, the premises are in fact all true.
Hence the conclusion of a sound argument must also be true.

Soundness of arguments
An argument is sound if and only if it is an
instance of a valid argument form, and in
addition, the premises are in fact all true.
Hence the conclusion of a sound argument must also be true.
(Premise)
If living expenses in this city are high,
then many students are struggling financially.
(Premise)
Not many students are struggling financially.
(Conclusion)
Hence, living expenses in this city are not high.
As is well known by many students living in expensive cities
around the world, this argument is valid, but not sound.

▶For an argument to be invalid, there has to be at least one
situation in which the premises are all true, but the conclusion
is false at the same time.
