About the Author
Alan L. Rubin, M.D., is one of the nation’s foremost experts on diabetes.
He is a professional member of the American Diabetes Association and the
Endocrine Society and has been in private practice specializing in diabetes
and thyroid disease for more than 30 years. Dr. Rubin was Assistant Clinical
Professor of Medicine at University of California Medical Center in San
Francisco for 20 years. He has spoken about diabetes to professional medical
audiences and non-medical audiences around the world. He has been a con-
sultant to many pharmaceutical companies and companies that make dia-
betes products.
Dr. Rubin was one of the first specialists in his field to recognize the signifi-
cance of patient self-testing of blood glucose, the major advance in diabetes
care since the advent of insulin. As a result, he has been on numerous radio
and television programs, talking about the cause, the prevention, and the
treatment of diabetes and its complications. 
Since publishing Diabetes For Dummies, Dr. Rubin has had four other best-
selling For Dummies books — Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, Thyroid For
Dummies, High Blood Pressure For Dummies, and Type 1 Diabetes For
Dummies — all published by Wiley Publishing. His five books cover the 
medical problems of 100 million Americans.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my wife Enid and my children, Renee and Larry.
Their patience, enthusiasm, and encouragement helped to make the writing
a real pleasure.
This third edition is also dedicated to the thousands of people with diabetes
who have written to thank me for helping them to understand what they are
dealing with and for telling me where I need to provide more information and
emphasis to make this an even better book.
Author’s Acknowledgments
For this third edition, acquisitions editor Michael Lewis deserves major
thanks. I have had the pleasure of working with him for several years. He is
supportive, encouraging, and fun and I look forward to a long association
with him. I am also blessed with another great project editor, Jennifer Connolly,
who not only made sure that everything was readable and understandable,
but offered excellent suggestions to improve the information. My thanks also
to Dr. Seymour Levin for reviewing the book for scientific accuracy.
Ronnie and Michael Goldfield should definitely be considered the godparents
of this book.
My friends in the Dawn Patrol, a group of guys with whom I play squash and
solve the problems of the world thereafter, kept me laughing throughout the
production of this book. Their willingness to follow me convinced me that
others would be willing to read what I wrote.
My teachers are too numerous to mention, but one group deserves special
attention. They are my patients over the last 35 years, the people whose
trials and tribulations caused me to seek the knowledge that you will find in
this book.
This book is written on the shoulders of thousands of men and women who
made the discoveries and held the committee meetings. Their accomplish-
ments cannot possibly be given adequate acclaim. We owe them big-time.

Introduction
A
third edition: Wow, is it really necessary? You bet it is. So much has
happened since the last edition. Doctors have learned so much more
about the cause of the complications of diabetes, about new treatments for
diabetes and, unfortunately, about the nature of diabetes — diabetes is not
only not going away, but it is spreading almost like a contagious infection,
especially in places where it was rarely seen before, places like China and
India. As these places adopt a Western lifestyle, their people are developing
Western diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.
It is estimated that the current prevalence of diabetes throughout the world
is 2.8 percent. By 2030 that figure is expected to go up to 4.4 percent. Put
another way, there are currently 171 million people with diabetes in the
world. By 2030 there will be 366 million, a little more than the current popula-
tion of the United States.
The condition has gotten so prevalent that November is National Diabetes
Awareness Month, and as I write this in November 2007 the world is about to
“celebrate” World Diabetes Day. On World Diabetes Day, events take place
like walks for diabetes, workshops for diabetes, and races for diabetes from
Australia to Zagreb. In fact, the United Nations proclaims diabetes to be a
worldwide, debilitating disease that is costly, has profound life-changing ram-
ifications, and poses a risk to the entire world. 
In the United States the situation is especially dire because large numbers of
children are developing type 2 diabetes. It used to be rare in children. Because
the long-term complications of diabetes, which you will learn about in Chapter
5, take 10 to 15 years of poor diabetic control to develop, the United States may
soon begin to see a significant population of 25- to 30-year-old people with blind-
ness, kidney failure, and painful nerve disease, not to mention amputations. 
In a sense, a diagnosis of diabetes is both good news and bad news. It is bad
news because you have a disease you’d happily do without. It is good news if
you use it to make some changes in your lifestyle that can not only prevent
complications but help you to live a longer and higher quality life.
As for laughing about it, at times you will feel like doing anything but laugh-
ing. But scientific studies are clear about the benefits of a positive attitude. In
a very few words: He who laughs, lasts. Another point is that people learn
more and retain more when humor is part of the process. If you have experi-
enced something funny during the course of your diabetes care, I hope you
share it with me. My goal is not to trivialize human suffering by being comic

about it, but to lighten the burden of a chronic disease by showing that it is
not all gloom and doom.
About This Book
As I said above, so much has changed in the four years since the second 
edition of Diabetes For Dummies was written that a third edition was clearly
necessary. I need to tell you about new medicines (see Chapter 10), new glu-
cose meters (Chapter 7), and new ideas about diet and exercise (Chapters 8
and 9). I also need to share new information about diabetes in certain ethnic
groups (Chapter 2), diabetes in children (Chapter 13), and the occupational
and insurance problems of people with diabetes (Chapter 15). Just about
every chapter has something new, especially (obviously) Chapter 16, “What’s
New in Diabetes Care.”
A new edition also gives me the opportunity to thank the thousands of
people who have thanked me for Diabetes For Dummies. You have given me a
sense of enormous gratification for writing this book. You have shared your
stories with me, permitting me to laugh and cry with you. One of the best is
the following from Andrea in Canada:
My 3-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with diabetes type one. It has
been a rough time. To help us out my brother and his wife bought us your
book, Diabetes For Dummies. One day my daughter saw this bright yellow
book and asked what I was reading. I told her Diabetes For Dummies. As
soon as the words came out of my mouth, I regretted it. I didn’t want her to
think that dummies got diabetes so I quickly added, “I am the dummy.”
Without missing a beat, she then asked, “Am I the diabetes?”
The story doesn’t just end there. The other day she was relaxing on the
couch. She looked at me and said, “I don’t want to have diabetes anymore.”
Feeling terrible I responded, “I know sweetie; I don’t want you to have it
anymore either.” I then explained that she would have diabetes for the rest
of her life. With a very concerned look she then asked, “Will you be the
dummy for the rest of your life?”
As sad as it is, I guess you’re right, one must look for humor in 
everything, otherwise we would have broken down by now.
You’re not required to read this book from cover to cover, although if you
know nothing about diabetes, this may be a good approach. This book is
designed to serve as a source for information about the problems that arise
over the years. You can find the latest facts about diabetes and the best
sources to discover any information that comes out after the publication of
this edition.

Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout the book I use some specific conventions to make the text
clearer, to highlight information, and to make your read as effortless as possi-
ble. These conventions are important to know so I list them below:
 Sugar versus glucose: Diabetes, as you know, is all about sugar. But
sugars come in many types. So doctors avoid using the words sugar and
glucose interchangeably. In this book (unless I slip up), I use the word
glucose rather than sugar. (You might as well get used to it, sweetie.)
 Emphasis on type 2 diabetes: There are a number of different types 
of diabetes (see my explanation in Chapter 3), led by type 1 diabetes 
and type 2 diabetes. Because I recently published Type 1 Diabetes For
Dummies (Wiley), most of what you read here will be about type 2 
diabetes. 
 Diabetes Care: You may often see me discuss findings from the journal,
Diabetes Care, which is published by the ADA. This journal is the most
widely read clinical diabetes journal by professionals around the world.
Keep that in mind whenever you see me discuss its findings.
 Abbreviations: To save time, I use the following abbreviations: 
• T1DM: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (formal name of type 1 diabetes)
• T2DM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (formal name of type 1 diabetes)
What You’re Not to Read
Throughout the book, you find shaded areas called sidebars. These sidebars
contain material that is interesting but not essential. I hereby give you per-
mission to skip them if the material inside them is of no particular interest 
to you. You will still understand everything else. In addition, I’ve noted some
paragraphs that have a more technical nature with the Technical Stuff icon
(see the section “Icons Used in This Book,” later in this Introduction for more
information on icons). Although these paragraphs both deepen your knowl-
edge of diabetes as well as broaden your vocabulary, you can still understand
the text without reading them. My feelings won’t get hurt if you don’t read
these paragraphs, but these technical tidbits may come in handy during a
high-stakes trivia game or at the very least can make you sound pretty smart
in front of your doctor.

Introduction

Foolish Assumptions
The book assumes that you know nothing about diabetes. So you will not
suddenly have to face a term that is not explained and that you never heard
of before. For those who already know a lot about diabetes, you can find
more in-depth explanations. You can pick and choose how much you want 
to know about a subject, but the key points are clearly marked.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts to help you find out all you can about the
topic of diabetes.
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes
To slay the dragon, you have to be able to identify it. This part explains the
different types of diabetes, how you get them, and whether you can give
them to others.
In this part, you find out how to deal with the emotional and psychological
consequences of the diagnosis and what all those big words mean. You also
find out how to prevent the complications of diabetes.
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body
In medical history, there have been a few diseases that seem to affect every
part of the body. If you understand diabetes, you will have a pretty good
grasp of how other illnesses can change the state of your health.
In this part, you find out what you need to know about both the short- and
long-term complications of diabetes. You also find out about some sexual
problems related to diabetes and the problems of a diabetic pregnancy.
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving
with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan
In this part, you discover all the tools available to treat diabetes. You find out
about the kinds of tests that you should be doing on your own, as well as the
4
Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

tests your doctor should order to get a clear picture of the severity of your
diabetes. I also show you what to do about your specific condition and how
to follow the success of therapy.
You also discover the dietary changes that you need to make to control your
blood glucose and how to get the most out of your exercise routine and med-
ications.
Finally, you find out about the huge amount of help available to you and your
family. It is yours for the taking, and you definitely should take advantage of it.
Part IV: Special Considerations 
for Living with Diabetes
The way that diabetes develops is different for each age group. In this part,
you are shown those differences and how to manage them. I will have a lot
more to say about children with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). You also
find out about some of the special economic problems of people with dia-
betes, which relate to jobs and insurance.
Lastly, this part covers all the new developments in diagnosing, monitoring,
and treating diabetes and helps correct a lot of misinformation about dia-
betes treatment.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part presents some key suggestions: the stuff you most need to know, as
well as the stuff you least want to know.
You discover the ten commandments of diabetes care and the myths that
confuse many diabetic patients. You also find out how to get others to help
you in your efforts to control your diabetes.
Part VI: Appendixes
Two special appendixes help you improve your diet by giving you recipes
and diabetic exchanges. Another appendix points out hot spots to visit on
the Internet. And in case you forget what a term means, you can quickly flip
to the handy glossary in the back of this book.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
The icons alert you to information you must know, information you should
know, and information you may find interesting but can live without.
I use this icon whenever I tell a story about patients.
This icon gives you technical information or terminology that may be helpful,
but not necessary, to your understanding of the topic.
When you see this icon, it means the information is essential and you should
be aware of it.
This icon points out when you should see your doctor (for example, if your
blood glucose level is too high or you need a particular test done).
This icon marks important information that can save you time and energy.
This icon warns against potential problems (for example, if you don’t treat a
complication of diabetes properly).
Where to Go from Here
Where you go from here depends upon your needs. If you already have a
basic knowledge of diabetes and want to know more about complications, go
to Chapter 3. If you are a novice, start at Chapter 1. If you want to know more
about the medications you are taking, go to Chapter 10. Each chapter title
clearly tells you what you will find there, so check the table of contents to
find what you need rapidly.
Let’s get started on this trip we are taking together. Welcome! I hope it will be
as much fun and as enlightening for you as it was for me.

Diabetes For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Part I
Dealing with the
Onset of Diabetes

In this part . . .
You have found out that you or a loved one has dia-
betes. What do you do now? This part tells you about
the emotional crisis that you may go through and emerge
prepared to live with this chronic disease. I walk you
through stages from wondering whether the diagnosis is
correct to avoiding the complications associated with dia-
betes. You will discover the different kinds of diabetes and
where you fit in. I explain the new concept of prediabetes
and discuss how you can actually prevent diabetes.

Chapter 1
Dealing with Diabetes
In This Chapter
 Meeting others with diabetes
 Coping with the initial diagnosis
 Upholding your quality of life
A
s a person with diabetes, you’re more than the sum of your blood glu-
cose levels. You have feelings, and you have a history. The way that you
respond to the challenges of diabetes determines whether the disease will be
a moderate annoyance or the source of major sickness.
One of my patients told me about working at her first job out of college,
where each employee birthday was celebrated with cake. She came to the
first celebration and was urged to eat a slice. She refused and refused, until
finally she had to say, “I can’t eat the cake because I am diabetic.” The woman
urging her said, “Thank God. I thought you just had incredible willpower.”
Twenty years later, my patient clearly remembers being told that having dia-
betes is better than having willpower. Another patient told me the following:
“The hardest thing about having diabetes is having to deal with doctors who
do not respect me.” Several times over the years, she had followed her
doctor’s recommendations exactly, but her glucose control had not been sat-
isfactory. The doctor blamed her for this “failure.”
Unless you live alone on a desert island (in which case I’m impressed that
you got your hands on this book), your diabetes doesn’t affect just you. How
you deal with your diabetes affects your family, friends, and coworkers as
they desire to help you. This chapter shows you how to cope with diabetes
and how to understand its impact on your important relationships.
Achieving Anything . . . Or Everything!
Are you as pretty as Nicole Johnson, the 1999 Miss America? Are you as
funny as Jackie Gleason or Jack Benny? Do you have the inventive powers of
Thomas Alva Edison? You have at least one thing in common with all of these
famous people — diabetes — and you may have even more. The fact is, many

people — from athletes to actors and politicians to painters — have found
success despite the fact that they have had diabetes. Just take a look at the
following sections. Perhaps you can find not only inspiration from the names
mentioned, but also the same greatness and strength that motivated these
successful individuals even though they wrestled with diabetes.
Keeping good company
Diabetes is a common disease, so it’s bound to occur in some very extraordi-
nary people. The list of people with diabetes is long, and you may be amazed
at the caliber of the company you keep. The point is that every one of these
people lives or lived with this chronic illness, and every one of them was able
to do something special with his or her life.
Many politicians have diabetes — perhaps the result of eating too many
fundraising dinners full of alcohol, starchy foods, and calorie-rich desserts.
(See Chapter 4 for the role diet plays in the onset of diabetes.) Mike
Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and recent presidential candidate is
a prime example of an outstanding politician with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
Another former governor, Charles “Buddy” Roemer of Louisiana, also has
T2DM. He has the distinction of being the first sitting governor in modern his-
tory to switch parties while in office. James Lloyd, who served in the U.S.
Congress from 1975 to 1981 did not let his T2DM interfere with his political
career. Marion Barry, who overcame not only T2DM but a drug habit, was
mayor of Washington, D. C. for four separate terms. 
Among actors and comedians with diabetes, Jackie Gleason is memorable for
his motto, “How sweet it is!” (Could he have been referring to his diabetes or
his blood glucose?) Jerry Lewis, who seems to go on and on, raising millions
of dollars every year for children with muscular dystrophy, is another come-
dian who does not let diabetes ruin his sense of humor. Elizabeth Taylor, one
of the most beautiful actresses in movies, never let her diabetes keep her
from a great performance.
Walt Kelly, who drew the Pogo comic strip, joins Paul Cézanne in the category
of artists with diabetes. Writers Mario Puzo, author of The Godfather, Ernest
Hemingway, and H. G. Wells all made their marks despite their diabetes. In
the business world, Ray Kroc founded the McDonald’s chain while dealing
with diabetes.
The list of singers and musicians with diabetes contains some of the greatest
voices. Blues singer .B. B. King, soul singer Pattie Labelle, and jazz singer
Peggy Lee are all great additions to the people with diabetes who are sterling
entertainers. Neil Young is no slouch in the music department, either. His 
10
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

diabetes has not stopped him from recording some of the great albums of the
last decades.
Diabetes doesn’t prevent the achievement of great records in sports. Athletes
tend to develop T2DM when they are no longer in great physical shape, but
there are exceptions. Diabetes didn’t stop Mike Sinclair from becoming a
three-time Pro Bowler in the National Football League during eleven seasons.
Joe Frazier could box like few others despite his diabetes mellitus. Billie Jean
King put women’s tennis on the map when she beat Bobby Riggs; diabetes
certainly didn’t slow her serve. (To read about the role of sports and exercise
in your life, see Chapter 9.) Gary Hall is a swimmer with diabetes who won
ten Olympic medals in 2000 and 2004. Adam Morrison is a professional bas-
ketball player with diabetes.
Realizing your potential
The names in the preceding paragraphs are just a few examples of people
with diabetes who have achieved greatness. Here is my point: Diabetes
shouldn’t stop you from doing what you want to do with your life. You must
follow the rules of good diabetic care, as I describe in Chapters 7 through 12.
But if you follow these rules, you will actually be healthier than people with-
out diabetes who smoke, overeat, and/or don’t exercise enough.
Perhaps the many people with diabetes who have achieved greatness used
the same personal strengths to overcome the difficulties associated with dia-
betes as they did to excel at their particular callings. Or maybe their diabetes
forced them to be stronger and to persevere more, which contributed to their
success. Chapter 15 shows you a few areas (such as piloting a commercial
flight) in which certain people with diabetes can’t participate — (due to the
ignorance of some legislators). Those people with diabetes will achieve com-
plete freedom of choice when they show that they can safely and compe-
tently do anything that a person without diabetes can do.
Reacting to Your Diagnosis
Do you remember what you were doing when you found out that you had dia-
betes? Unless you were too young to understand, the news was quite a shock.
Suddenly you had a condition from which people can die. In fact, many of the
feelings that you went through were exactly those of a person learning that
he or she is dying. The following sections describe the normal stages of react-
ing to a diagnosis of a major medical condition, such as diabetes.
11
Chapter 1: Dealing with Diabetes

Experiencing denial
Your first response was probably to deny that you had diabetes, despite all of
the evidence. Your denial mindset may have begun when your doctor tried to
“sugarcoat” (forgive the pun) the news of your condition by telling you that
you had just “a touch of diabetes,” (an impossibility equivalent to “a touch of
pregnancy”). You probably looked for any evidence that the whole thing was
a mistake.
Perhaps you even neglected to take your medication, follow your diet, or per-
form the exercise that is so important to maintaining your body. Ultimately,
you had to accept the diagnosis and begin to gather the information you
needed to help yourself.
When you accepted the diabetes diagnosis, I hope you also shared the news
with your family, friends, and people close to you. Having diabetes isn’t
something to be ashamed of, and you shouldn’t hide it from anyone. You
need the help of everyone in your community: your coworkers who need to
know not to tempt you with treats that you can’t eat; your friends who need
to know how to give you glucagon, a treatment for low blood glucose, if you
become unconscious from a severe insulin reaction (see Chapter 4); and your
family who needs to know how to support and encourage you to keep going.
Your diabetes isn’t your fault — nor is it a form of leprosy or some other dis-
ease that carries a social stigma. Diabetes also isn’t contagious; no one can
catch it from you.
When you’re accepting and open about having diabetes, you’ll find that
you’re far from alone in your situation. (If you don’t believe me, read the sec-
tion “Keeping good company,” earlier in this chapter.) One of my patients told
me about experiences she had that helped her feel part of a community. She
arrived at work one morning and was very worried when she realized that
she had forgotten her insulin. But she quickly found a source of comfort
when she remembered that she could go to a diabetic coworker and ask to
borrow some insulin. Another time, she was at a party and stepped into a
friend’s bedroom to take a shot of insulin, and she found a man there doing
the same thing. Borrowing someone else’s insulin is probably not a good idea
because it may be contaminated, but you get the point.
Feeling anger
When you’ve passed the stage of denying that you have diabetes, you may
become angry that you’re saddled with this “terrible” diagnosis. But you’ll
quickly find that diabetes isn’t so terrible and that you can’t do anything to
rid yourself of the disease. Anger only worsens your situation, and being
angry about your diagnosis is detrimental in the following ways:
12
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

 If your anger becomes targeted at a person, he or she is hurt.
 You may feel guilty that your anger is harming you and those close to you.
 Anger can prevent you from successfully managing your diabetes.
As long as you’re angry, you are not in a problem-solving mode. Diabetes
requires your focus and attention. Use your energy positively to find creative
ways to manage your diabetes. (For ways to manage your diabetes, see Part III.)
Bargaining for more time
The stage of anger often transitions into a stage when you become increasingly
aware of your mortality and bargain for more time. Even though you probably
realize that you have plenty of life ahead of you, you may feel overwhelmed by
the talk of complications, blood tests, and pills or insulin. You may even experi-
ence depression, which makes good diabetic care all the more difficult.
Studies have shown that people with diabetes suffer from depression at a
rate that is two to four times higher than the rate for the general population.
Those with diabetes also experience anxiety at a rate three to five times
higher than people without diabetes.
If you suffer from depression, you may feel that your diabetic situation cre-
ates problems for you that justify being depressed. You may rationalize your
depression in the following ways:
 Diabetes hinders you as you try to make friends.
 You don’t have the freedom to choose your leisure activities.
 You’re too tired to overcome difficulties.
 You may dread the future and possible diabetic complications.
 You don’t have the freedom to eat what you want.
 You are constantly annoyed with all of the minor inconveniences of deal-
ing with diabetes.
All of the preceding concerns are legitimate, but they also are all surmount-
able. How do you handle your many concerns and fend off depression? The
following are a few important methods:
 Try to achieve excellent blood glucose control (see Part III).
 Begin a regular exercise program (Chapter 9).
 Tell a friend or relative how you are feeling; get it off your chest 
(Chapter 20).
 Recognize that every abnormal blip in your blood glucose is not your
fault (Chapter 7).
13
Chapter 1: Dealing with Diabetes

Moving on
If you can’t overcome the depression brought on by your diabetic concerns,
you may need to consider therapy or antidepressant drugs. But you probably
won’t reach that point. Or you may experience the various stages of reacting
to your diabetes in a different order than I describe in the previous sections.
Some stages may be more prominent, and others may be hardly noticeable.
Don’t feel that any anger, denial, or depression is wrong. These are natural
coping mechanisms that serve a psychological purpose for a brief time. Allow
yourself to have these feelings — then drop them. Move on and learn to live
normally with your diabetes.
Here are some key steps you can take to manage the emotional side of 
diabetes:
 Focus on your successes. Some things may go wrong as you find out all
there is to know about managing diabetes, but most things will go right.
As you concentrate on your successes, you will realize that you can
cope with diabetes and not let it overwhelm you.
 Involve the whole family in your diabetes. A diabetic diet is a healthy
diet for everyone. For instance, the exercise you do is good for the
whole family. By doing it together, you strengthen the family ties while
everyone benefits from a healthier lifestyle. Also, should you need your
family to help you, for instance, during a particularly severe low blood
glucose, their early involvement will give them the peace of mind to
know they are helping, not hurting you (Chapter 20).
 Develop a positive attitude. A positive attitude gives you a can-do mind-
set, whereas a negative attitude leads to low motivation preventing you
from doing all that is necessary to manage your diabetes.
 Find a great team, pinpoint problems, and set goals. Determine the
most difficult problems that you have with your diabetes and how to
solve them by yourself or with the great team of supporting players like
the diabetes specialist, the diabetes educator, the dietitian, the eye
doctor, the foot doctor, and so forth. Set realistic goals to get you past
your problems (Chapter 11).
 Don’t expect perfection. Although you may feel that you’re doing every-
thing right, you may find that your blood glucose levels are off. This 
situation happens to every person with diabetes and this unpredictable,
uncontrollable feature is one of the most frustrating of the disease. 
Don’t beat yourself up over something you can’t control. Keep doing the
things I suggest in the treatment section and you will be very gratified at
the end.
14
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

Maintaining a High Quality of Life
You may assume that a chronic disease like diabetes leads to a diminished
quality of life. It’s true that the percentage of people with diabetes who are
depressed is greater than the percentage in the nondiabetic population. But
do you have to settle for a lower quality of life just because you have dia-
betes? Of course not! A study reported in Diabetes Care in September 2007
showed that people with T2DM who were depressed adhered to their diet,
exercise, and testing regimens far less often and missed medication much
more often. However, those who were not depressed tended to act in the
opposite way.
This study as well as several others have evaluated the quality of life ques-
tion, and the following sections not only describe what these studies found,
but they also describe the hope: that you can take control and ensure that
you maintain a high quality of life.
The importance of regular exercise
Most of the other studies of quality of life for people with diabetes have been
long-term studies. In one study of more than 2,000 people with diabetes
receiving many different levels of intensity of treatment, the overall response
was that quality of life was lower for the person with diabetes than for the
general population. But several factors separated those with the lower qual-
ity of life from those who expressed more contentment with life.
One factor that contributed to a lower quality of life rating was a lack of phys-
ical activity, one negative factor that you can alter immediately. Physical
activity is a habit that you must maintain on a lifelong basis. (See Chapter 9
for advice on exercise.) The problem is that making a long-term change to a
more physically active lifestyle is difficult; most people become more active
for a time but eventually fall back into inactive routines.
Another study demonstrated the tendency for people with diabetes (and for
people in general) to abandon exercise programs after a certain period of
time. This information was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine
in July 1991. In this study, a group of people with diabetes received profes-
sional support for two years to encourage them to increase physical activity.
For the first six months, the study participants responded well and exercised
regularly resulting in improved blood glucose, weight management, and over-
all health. After that, participants began to drop out and not come to training
sessions. At the end of the two-year study, most participants had regained
their weight and slipped back into poor glucose control. However, it’s note-
worthy that the few who didn’t stop their exercise maintained the benefits
and continued to report an improved quality of life.
15
Chapter 1: Dealing with Diabetes

The (minimal) impact 
of insulin treatments
Perhaps you’re afraid that intensified insulin treatment, which involves three
or four daily shots of insulin and frequent testing of blood glucose, will keep
you from doing the things that you want to do and will diminish your daily
quality of life. (See Chapter 10 for more information about intensified insulin
treatment.)
16
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 
When you’re having trouble coping
You wouldn’t hesitate to seek help for your phys-
ical ailments associated with diabetes, but you
may be reluctant to seek help when you can’t
adjust psychologically to diabetes. The problem
is that sooner or later, your psychological mal-
adjustment will ruin any control that you have
over your diabetes. And, of course, you won’t
lead a very pleasant life if you’re in a depressed
or anxious state all the time. The following
symptoms are indicators that you’re past the
point of handling your diabetes on your own and
may be suffering from depression:
 You can’t sleep.
 You have no energy when you’re awake.
 You can’t think clearly.
 You can’t find activities that interest or
amuse you.
 You feel worthless.
 You have frequent thoughts of suicide.
 You have no appetite.
 You find no humor in anything.
If you recognize several of these symptoms in
your daily life, you need to get some help. Your
sense of hopelessness may include the feeling
that no one else can help you — simply not true.
First, go to your primary physician or endocri-
nologist for advice. He or she may help you to
see the need for some short-term or long-term
therapy. Well-trained therapists — especially
therapists trained to take care of people with
diabetes — can see solutions that you can’t see
in your current state. You need to find a thera-
pist whom you can trust, so that when you’re
feeling low you can talk to this person and feel
assured that he or she is very interested in your
welfare.
Your therapist may decide that you would bene-
fit from medication to treat the anxiety or depres-
sion. Currently, many drugs are available that are
proven safe and free of side effects. Sometimes
a brief period of medication is enough to help you
adjust to your diabetes.
You can also find help in a support group. The
huge and continually growing number of sup-
port groups shows that positive things are hap-
pening in these groups. In most support groups,
participants share their stories and problems,
helping everyone involved cope with their own
feelings of isolation, futility, or depression.

In Diabetes Care in November 1998 a study explored whether the extra effort
and time consumed by such diabetes treatments had an adverse effect on
people’s quality of life. The study compared people with diabetes to people
with other chronic diseases, such as gastrointestinal disease and hepatitis
(liver infection), and then compared all of those groups to a group of people
who had no disease. The diabetic group reported a higher quality of life than
the other chronic illness groups. Interestingly, the people in the diabetic
group were not so much concerned with the physical problems of diabetes,
such as intense and time-consuming tests and treatments, as they were con-
cerned with the social and psychological difficulties.
Other key quality of life factors
Many other studies have examined the different aspects of diabetes that
affect quality of life. These studies show some useful information on the fol-
lowing topics:
 Family support: People with diabetes greatly benefit from their family’s
help in dealing with their disease. But do people with diabetes in a close
family have better diabetic control? One study in Diabetes Care in
February 1998 addressed this question and found some unexpected
results. Having a supportive family didn’t necessarily mean that the
person with diabetes would maintain better glucose control. But a sup-
portive family did make the person with diabetes feel more physically
capable in general and much more comfortable with his or her place in
society.
 Insulin injections for adults: Do adults with diabetes who require
insulin shots experience a diminished quality of life? A report in Diabetes
Care in June 1998 found that insulin injections don’t reduce the quality
of life; the person’s sense of physical and emotional well-being remains
the same after beginning insulin injections as it was before injections
were necessary.
 Insulin injections for teenagers: Teenagers who require insulin injections
don’t always accept the treatment as well as adults do, so teenagers
more often experience a diminished quality of life. However, a study of
more than 2,000 such teenagers in Diabetes Care in November 2001
showed that as their diabetic control improved, they felt like they were in
better health, experienced greater satisfaction with their lives, and there-
fore believed themselves to be less of a burden to their families.
 Stress management: A study described in Diabetes Care in January 2002
showed that lowering stress lowers blood glucose. Patients were divided
into two groups, one of which received diabetes education alone and the
other diabetes education plus five sessions of stress management. The
latter group showed significant improvement in diabetic control versus
the former group, who received only diabetes education.

Chapter 1: Dealing with Diabetes

 Quality of life over the long term: How does a person’s perception of
quality of life change over time? As they age, do most people with dia-
betes feel that their quality of life increases, decreases, or persists at a
steady level? The consensus of several studies is that most people with
diabetes experience an increasing quality of life as they get older. People
feel better about themselves and their diabetes after dealing with the
disease for a decade or more. This report shows the healing property 
of time.
The bottom line
So what can you do to maintain a high quality of life with diabetes? Here are
the steps that accomplish the most for you:
 Keep your blood glucose as normal as possible (see Part III).
 Make exercise a regular part of your lifestyle (Chapter 9).
 Get plenty of support from family, friends, and medical resources
Chapter 20).
 Stay aware of the latest developments in diabetes care.
 Maintain a healthy attitude. Remember that someday you will laugh
about things that bug you now, so why wait?

 Testing for prediabetes
 Defining diabetes by the blood glucose
 Finding treatments for diabetes
 Meeting actual patients and their stories
T
he Greeks and Romans knew about diabetes. The way they tested for the
condition was — prepare yourself — by tasting people’s urine. In this
way, the Romans discovered that the urine of certain people was mellitus, the
Latin word for sweet. (They got their honey from the island of Malta, which
they called Mellita.) In addition, the Greeks noticed that when people with
sweet urine drank, the fluids came out in the urine almost as fast as they
went in the mouth, like a siphon. The Greek word for siphon is diabetes. Thus
we have the origins of the modern name for the disease, diabetes mellitus.
In this chapter, I cover some not-so-fun stuff about diabetes — the big words,
the definitions, and so on. But if you really want to understand what’s hap-
pening to your body when you have diabetes — and I know I would — then
you won’t want to skip this chapter.
Detecting Prediabetes
Diabetes does not suddenly appear one day without previous notification
from your body. For a period of time, which may last up to ten years, you may
not quite achieve the criteria for a diagnosis of diabetes, but you aren’t quite
normal either. During this time, you have what’s called prediabetes.
A person with prediabetes does not usually develop eye disease, kidney dis-
ease, or nerve damage (all potential complications of diabetes, which I dis-
cuss in Chapter 5). However, a person with prediabetes has a much greater
risk of developing heart disease and brain attacks than someone with entirely
normal blood glucose levels. Prediabetes has a lot in common with insulin
resistance syndrome, also known as the metabolic syndrome, which I discuss

in Chapter 5. The following two sections take the mystery out of whether you
may have prediabetes by giving you some guidelines on when to get tested as
well as what testing for prediabetes involves.
Knowing whether you should get tested
Approximately 54 million people in the United States have prediabetes,
although most don’t know it. Testing for prediabetes is a good idea for every-
one over the age of 45. I also recommend testing for people who are under 45
if they are overweight and have one or more of the following risk factors:
 A high-risk ethnic group: African American, Hispanic, Asian, or Native
American
 High blood pressure
 Low HDL or “good” cholesterol
 High triglycerides
 A family history of diabetes
 Diabetes during a pregnancy or having a newborn who weighed more
than nine pounds
A study in the journal Diabetes Care in November 2007 showed that testing for
prediabetes in overweight or obese people over age 45 is highly cost effective
if they then undergo lifestyle modification (see Chapters 7 through 12) or take
medication if necessary. 
Testing for prediabetes
Testing for prediabetes involves finding out your blood glucose level , the
level of sugar in your blood. Prediabetes exists when the body’s blood glu-
cose level is higher than normal, but not high enough to meet the standard
definition of diabetes mellitus (which I discuss in the section “Testing for dia-
betes,” later in this chapter). Testing is done by measuring a random capil-
lary blood glucose. If the level is greater than 100 mg/dl, a fasting plasma
glucose or oral glucose tolerance test is performed. Table 2-1 shows the glu-
cose levels that indicate prediabetes:
 If the glucose before the test (the fasting plasma glucose) is between 100
and 125 mg/dl, the person has impaired fasting glucose, the glucose
before eating (see Table 2-1). The glucose in the fasting (no food for 8
hours) state is not normal but not high enough to diagnose diabetes.
 If the glucose is between 140 and 199 mg/dl at one hour after eating, the
person has impaired glucose tolerance. Both impaired fasting glucose
and impaired glucose tolerance may be present.

140–199 mg/dl (7.8–11.1 mmol/L)
Diagnosing prediabetes can be the best thing that ever happened to a person!
It could be the wake up call that he or she needs. The diagnosis may motivate
a person to make crucial lifestyle changes, especially diet and exercise, which
have been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in people with prediabetes.
And for those who don’t respond to lifestyle changes, medication may
accomplish the same thing.
After a diagnosis of prediabetes is made, all the techniques described in
Chapters 7 through 12 can help prevent the onset of clinical diabetes. If
patients with prediabetes are left untreated, large numbers of these patients
will develop diabetes over time. Preventing diabetes saves almost ten thou-
sand dollars of costs for the treatment of diabetes. And it prevented almost
20 percent of those with prediabetes from becoming diabetic. 
Understanding What Diabetes Does
When prediabetes becomes diabetes, the body’s blood glucose level registers
even higher. In this section, I discuss the role of glucose in your body, the evi-
dence for diabetes, and the symptoms you may experience with diabetes.
Realizing the role of glucose
The body has three sources of energy: protein, fat, and carbohydrates. I 
discuss the first two sources in greater detail in Chapter 8, but I’ll tackle 
the third one now. Sugar is a carbohydrate. Many different kinds of sugars
exist in nature, but glucose, the sugar that has the starring role in the body,
provides a source of instant energy so that muscles can move and important
chemical reactions can take place. Table sugar, or sucrose, is actually two dif-
ferent kinds of sugar — glucose and fructose — linked together. Fructose is
the type of sugar found in fruits and vegetables. Because fructose is sweeter
than glucose, sucrose, a combination of fructose and glucose, is sweeter than
glucose alone as well. Therefore, your taste buds don’t need as much sucrose
or fructose to get the same sweet taste of glucose.
21
Chapter 2: It’s the Glucose

Frequent thirst and urination are the most commonly recognized symptoms
of diabetes, but diabetes mellitus is not the only condition that causes these
symptoms. Another condition in which fluids go in and out of the body like a
siphon is called diabetes insipidus. With this condition, the urine is not sweet.
Diabetes insipidus is an entirely different disease that you should not mistake
for diabetes mellitus. Diabetes insipidus results when a hormone in the brain
called antidiuretic hormone is missing. This hormone normally helps the kid-
neys prevent the loss of a lot of the water in the body. Other than the name
diabetes, this condition has nothing to do with diabetes mellitus.
Testing for diabetes
The standard definition of diabetes mellitus is excessive glucose in a blood
sample. For years, doctors set this level fairly high. The standard level for
normal glucose was lowered in 1997 because too many people were experi-
encing complications of diabetes even though they did not have the disease
by the then-current standard. In November 2003, the standard level was mod-
ified again.
After much discussion, many meetings, and the usual deliberations that sur-
round a momentous decision, the American Diabetes Association published
the new standard for diagnosis, which includes any one of the following three
criteria:
 Casual plasma glucose concentration greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl,
along with symptoms of diabetes (which I discuss in the section “Losing
control of glucose” later in this chapter). Casual plasma glucose refers to
the glucose level when the patient eats normally prior to the test.
Mg/dl stands for milligrams per deciliter. The rest of the world uses the
International System (SI), where the units are mmol/L, which means mil-
limoles per liter. To get mmol/L, you divide mg/dl by 18. Therefore, 200
mg/dl equals 11.1 mmol/L.
 Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl or 7
mmol/L. Fasting means that the patient has consumed no food for eight
hours prior to the test.
 Blood glucose of greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) when
tested two hours (2-h PG) after ingesting 75 grams of glucose by mouth.
This test has long been known as the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.
Although this time-consuming, cumbersome test is rarely done, it
remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of diabetes.
22
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

Putting the criteria for diagnosis another way:
 FPG less than 100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/L) is a normal fasting glucose.
 FPG greater than or equal to 100 mg/dl but less than 126 mg/dl (7.0
mmol/L) is impaired fasting glucose (indicating prediabetes).
 FPG equal to or greater than 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) gives a provisional
diagnosis of diabetes.
 2-h PG less than 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/L) is normal glucose tolerance.
 2-h PG greater than or equal to 140 mg/dl but less than 200 mg/dl (11.1
mmol/L) is impaired glucose tolerance.
 2-h PG equal to or greater than 200 mg/ dl gives a provisional diagnosis
of diabetes.
If you test positive for diabetes one time, that is not enough to confirm a 
diagnosis. Any one of the tests must be positive on another occasion to make
a diagnosis of diabetes. I’ve had patients come to me with a diagnosis of dia-
betes after being tested only once, and a second test has shown the initial
diagnosis to be incorrect.
Controlling glucose
In order to understand the symptoms of diabetes, you need to know a little
about the way the body normally handles glucose and what happens when
things go wrong.
A hormone called insulin finely controls the level of glucose in your blood. A
hormone is a chemical substance made in one part of the body that travels
(usually through the bloodstream) to a distant part of the body where it per-
forms its work. In the case of insulin, that work is to act like a key to open a
cell (such as a muscle, fat, or liver cell) so that glucose can enter. If glucose
can’t enter the cell, it can provide no energy to the body.
Insulin is essential for growth. In addition to providing the key to entry of 
glucose into the cell, insulin is considered the builder hormone because it
enables fat and muscle to form. It promotes the storage of glucose in a form
called glycogen for use when fuel is not coming in. It also blocks the break-
down of protein. Without insulin, you do not survive for long.
With this fine-tuning, your body keeps the level of glucose pretty steady at
about 60 to 100 mg/dl (3.3 to 6.4 mmol/L) all the time.
23
Chapter 2: It’s the Glucose

Losing control of glucose
Your glucose starts to rise in your blood when you don’t have a sufficient
amount of insulin or when your insulin is not working effectively. When your
glucose rises above 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/L), glucose begins to spill into the
urine and make it sweet. Up to that point, the kidney, the filter for the blood,
is able to extract the glucose before it enters your urine. The loss of glucose
into the urine leads to many of the short-term complications of diabetes. (See
Chapter 4 for more on short-term complications.)
The following list contains the most common early symptoms of diabetes and
how they occur. One or more of the following symptoms may be present
when diabetes is diagnosed:
 Frequent urination and thirst: The glucose in the urine draws more
water out of your blood, so more urine forms. More urine in your blad-
der makes you feel the need to urinate more frequently, day and night.
As the amount of water in your blood declines, you feel thirsty and drink
much more frequently.
 Blurry vision: As the glucose level shifts from normal to very high, the
lens of the eye swells due to water intake. This swelling prevents the eye
from focusing light at the correct place and blurring occurs.
 Extreme hunger: Inability to get energy in the form of glucose into the
muscle cells that need it leads to a feeling of hunger despite all the glu-
cose that is floating in the blood stream. Such hunger is called “starva-
tion in the midst of plenty.”
 Fatigue: Without sufficient insulin, or with ineffective insulin, glucose
can’t enter cells (such as muscle and fat cells) that depend on insulin to
act as a key. (The most important exception here is the brain, which
does not need insulin.) As a result, glucose can’t be used as a fuel to
move muscles or to facilitate the many other chemical reactions that
have to take place to produce energy. A person with diabetes often com-
plains of fatigue and feels much stronger after treatment allows glucose
to enter his or her cells again.
 Weight loss: Weight loss occurs among some people with diabetes
because they lack insulin, the builder hormone. When the body lacks
insulin for any reason, the body begins to break down. You lose muscle
tissue. Some of the muscle converts into glucose even though the glu-
cose cannot get into cells. It passes out of your body in the urine. Fat
tissue breaks down into small fat particles that can provide an alternate
source of energy. As your body breaks down and you lose glucose in the
urine, you often experience weight loss. However, most people with dia-
betes are heavy rather than skinny. (I explain why in Chapter 3.)
24
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

 Persistent vaginal infection among women: As blood glucose rises, all
the fluids in your body contain higher levels of glucose, including the
sweat and body secretions such as semen in men and vaginal secretions
in women. Many bugs, such as bacteria and fungi, thrive in the high glu-
cose environment. Women begin to complain of itching or burning, an
abnormal discharge from the vagina, and sometimes an odor.
A study in the November 2007 issue of Diabetes Care, however, showed that
in a group of over 15,000 people being treated for diabetes, 44 percent of
them reported not one of the symptoms above in the previous year when
given a questionnaire. It is no wonder that a third of people with diabetes do
not know they have it. 
Tracing the History of 
Diabetes Treatment
More than 2,000 years ago, people writing in China and India described a con-
dition that must have been diabetes mellitus. The description is the same one
that the Greeks and Romans reported — urine that tasted sweet. Scholars
from India and China were the first to describe frequent urination. But not
until 1776 did researchers discover the cause of the sweetness — glucose.
And it wasn’t until the nineteenth century that doctors developed a new
chemical test to actually measure glucose in the urine.
Later discoveries showed that the pancreas produces a crucial substance
that controls the glucose in the blood: insulin. Since that discovery was
made, scientists have found ways to extract insulin and purify it so it can be
given to people whose insulin levels are too low.
After insulin was discovered, diabetes specialists, led by Elliot Joslin and
others, recommended three basic treatments for diabetes that are as valu-
able today as they were in 1921:
 Diet (see Chapter 8)
 Exercise (see Chapter 9)
 Medication (see Chapter 10)
Although the discovery of insulin immediately saved the lives of thousands of
very sick individuals for whom the only treatment had been starvation, it did
not solve the problem of diabetes. As these people aged, they were found to
have unexpected complications in the eyes, the kidneys, and the nervous
system (see Chapter 5). And insulin did not address the problem of the much
larger group of people with diabetes now known as type 2 (see Chapter 3).
Their problem was not lack of insulin but resistance to its actions. (Fortunately,
doctors do have the tools now to bring the disease under control.)

Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 
Tracking diabetes around the world
Diabetes is a global health problem. A 2004
study in Diabetes Care in October estimated
that approximately 171 million people around
the world had diabetes in 2000 and that by the
year 2030, the number would rise to more than
366 million. 
Diabetes is most concentrated in areas where
large food supplies allow people to eat more
calories than they need so that they develop
obesity, a condition of excessive fat. Several dif-
ferent types of diabetes exist, but the type usu-
ally associated with obesity, called type 2
diabetes (see Chapter 3), is far more prevalent
than the other types.
Another reason diabetes cases have continued
to grow in number throughout the world is that
the lifespan of the population is increasing.
What’s the connection? Well, as a person ages,
his or her chances of developing diabetes
increases greatly. Along with obesity, age is a
major risk factor for diabetes. (See Chapter 3 for
more risk factors.) So, as other diseases are
controlled and the population in general gets
older, more diabetes is being diagnosed.
One very interesting study traced people of
Japanese ancestry as they went from living in
Japan to living in Hawaii to living in the United
States mainland. In Japan, where people cus-
tomarily maintain a normal weight, they tended
to have a very low incidence of diabetes. As
they moved to Hawaii, the incidence of diabetes
began to rise along with their average weight.
On the U.S. mainland, where food is most avail-
able, these Japanese had the highest rate of
diabetes of all.
In general, as people migrate, not only the number
of calories they consume but the composition of
their diets changes. Before they migrate, they
tend to consume a low-fat, high-fiber diet. After
they reach their destination, they adopt the local
diet, which tends to be higher in fat and lower in
fiber. The carbohydrates in the new diet are from
high-energy foods, which do not tend to be filling,
promoting more caloric intake.
The Japanese provide another interesting
lesson about the place of obesity as a factor in
the onset of diabetes. Japanese Sumo
wrestlers have to gain enormous quantities of
weight in order to fight in a certain weight class.
Even while they are still fighting, they demon-
strate a high frequency of diabetes. After they
become more sedentary, the frequency goes up
to 40 percent, a huge prevalence.
The North American Indian, another group,
shows the consequences of switching from a
moderate calorie, relatively nutritious diet to a
higher calorie diet. Some tribes, such as the
Pima Indians, have a prevalence of diabetes as
high as one out of two people. In contrast, the
presence of diabetes in South American Indian
tribes, such as in Chile where they have main-
tained a more traditional diet, is extremely rare.
In China, as the country becomes more affluent,
doctors are seeing a significant increase in the
incidence of diabetes. Migrant Chinese popula-
tions show even higher rates, especially where
the environment allows them to gain more
weight and be more sedentary.
In the United States in the year 2005, about 20.8
million people had diabetes. This number rep-
resents about 7 to 8 percent of the population.
Currently only two thirds of the people with dia-
betes are aware that they have the condition.
The big project is to get people to know their
blood glucose level just like they know their
cholesterol, and to seek treatment.

The next major leap in the effort to treat diabetes, occurring in 1955, was the
discovery of the group of drugs called sulfonylureas (see Chapter 10), the first
drugs that could be taken by mouth to lower blood glucose levels. But even
as those drugs were improving patient care, the only way to know if some-
one’s blood glucose level was high was to test the urine, which was entirely
inadequate for good diabetic control (see Chapter 7).
Around 1980, the first portable meters for blood glucose testing became
available. It became possible, for the first time, to relate treatment to a mea-
surable outcome. This development has led, in turn, to the discovery of other
great drugs for diabetes like metformin, pioglitazone, and others yet to come.
If you are not using these wonderful tools for your diabetes, you are missing
the boat. You can find out exactly how to use portable meters in Part III.
Sharing Some Real Patient Stories
The numbers that are used to diagnose diabetes don’t begin to reflect the
human dimensions of the disease. People end up with test results after days,
months, or even years of minor discomforts that reach the point where they
can no longer be tolerated. The next few stories of real (though renamed)
patients can help you understand that diabetes is a disease that happens 
to real people — people who are working, relaxing, traveling, sleeping, and
doing many other things that make life so complex.
Jane Fein was a forty-six-year-old woman who worked in a computer com-
pany and had to do a lot of standing. She noticed that she had been having
some tingling in her feet but thought it was due to all the standing. However,
she had gained 22 pounds in the last six years and couldn’t seem to shed
them. She was beginning to wake up a few times at night to go to the bath-
room. She thought these symptoms might be associated with her
menopause, which was just beginning. She decided to see her gynecologist,
who told her everything was fine but suggested a urinalysis because she was
waking up so much. To everyone’s surprise, glucose was present in her urine,
and the gynecologist sent her to an internist. The internist did a random
(casual) glucose test in the lab. It was 225 mg/dl (12.5 mmol/L). He did a fast-
ing blood glucose test the next morning, and it was 163 mg/dl (9.0 mmol/L).
He made a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (see Chapter 3) and started Jane on a
program of diet and exercise.
Leslie Law was a 28-year-old woman who had just started a new job. She ate
well but was losing weight. She noticed increased thirst and urination, which
caused her boss to comment upon her frequent absences in the middle of
work. She decided to stop drinking so many beverages, but the urination con-
tinued, and she began to feel very weak. One afternoon, she fainted at the
office and was taken to the hospital. Her blood glucose was found to be 683
27
Chapter 2: It’s the Glucose

mg/dl (37.9 mmol/L). She was given fluids because she was very dehydrated,
and a repeat blood glucose test came back at 592 mg/dl (32.9 mmol/L). Leslie
began insulin treatment, rapidly regained her weight and her strength, and
returned to work after a few days.
Sal Renolo was a 46-year-old black belt judo instructor. Despite his very
active lifestyle, he was not careful about his diet and had gained 16 pounds 
in the last few years. He was more fatigued than he had been in the past but
blamed this fatigue on his increasing age. His mother had diabetes, but he
assumed that his physical fitness would protect him from this condition.
However, he could barely get through a one-hour class without excusing 
himself for a bathroom break. One of his new students had diabetes, and he
suggested to Sal that he ought to have the problem checked, but Sal insisted
that he could not possibly have diabetes with all his activity. The symptoms
of fatigue and frequent urination got worse, and Sal finally made an appoint-
ment with the doctor. Blood tests revealed a random blood glucose level of
264 mg/dl (14.7 mmol/L). The following week, another random blood glucose
was 289 (16.0 mmol/L). The doctor told Sal he had diabetes, but Sal refused
to believe it. He left the doctor’s office angry but vowed to lose weight and
did so successfully. On a repeat visit to the doctor, a random glucose was 
167 mg/dl (9.3 mmol/L). Sal told the doctor that he knew he did not have 
diabetes, but the resolve to eat carefully did not last, and he was back six
weeks later with a glucose of 302 mg/dl (16.8 mmol/L). Finally, Sal accepted
the diagnosis and started treatment. He rapidly returned to his usual state of
health, and the fatigue disappeared.
Debby O’Leary’s active sex life with her husband was continually being inter-
rupted by vaginal yeast infections, which resulted in an unpleasant odor and
redness and itching. Over-the-counter preparations promptly cured the con-
dition, but it always rapidly returned. Finally, after three of these infections in
two months, she decided to see her gynecologist. The gynecologist told her
she needed a prescription drug. The cure lasted a little longer this time, but
the infection promptly returned. On a return visit, the gynecologist did a uri-
nalysis and found glucose in her urine. A random blood test showed a glu-
cose of 243 mg/dl (13.5 mmol/L). He sent her to an internist, who ordered a
variety of tests including a fasting blood glucose, which was 149 mg/dl (8.3
mmol/L). The doctor told her she had diabetes and recommended exercise
and diet to start with. She followed his advice and as a result she not only
lowered her blood glucose to the point that she no longer developed yeast
infections, but also her resulting weight loss and increase of energy made her
sex life with her husband even more satisfying.

What Type of Diabetes 
Do You Have?
In This Chapter
 Paying attention to your pancreas
 Comparing type 1 and type 2 diabetes
 Developing gestational diabetes
 Being aware of other types of diabetes
L
adies and gentlemen, I’d like to introduce you to your pancreas. This 
shy little organ — to which you’ve probably never given a moment’s
attention — can rear its lovely head at entirely unexpected moments. (You
probably didn’t even know that your pancreas has a head and a tail, but it
does. Now you’ve broken the ice!) Most of the time, your pancreas hides
behind your stomach quietly doing its work, assisting with digestion first 
and then helping to make use of the digested food. The information in this
chapter should put you on closer terms with your pancreas, which is good,
because you need your pancreas as much as it needs you. In one way or
another, the pancreas plays a role in all of the various types of diabetes.
Here’s the good news: You can prevent diabetes. Here’s the bad news: You
can’t do so quite as easily as you may like. Your best method for preventing
diabetes is to pick your parents carefully, but that method is slightly imprac-
tical, even with modern technology.
In general, you can prevent a disease if it meets two requirements. First, 
you have to be able to identify if you are at high risk for getting the disease.
Second, some treatments or actions must exist that can definitely reduce the
occurrence of the disease. This chapter shows you how to identify whether
you’re at risk for type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and it covers definite actions that
you can take to prevent both of these types of diabetes.

This chapter also helps you get a clear understanding of your type of dia-
betes, how it relates to the other types of diabetes, and how the failure of
your friendly pancreas to do its assigned job can lead to a host of unfortu-
nate consequences. (I cover these consequences in detail in Part II.)
Getting to Know Your Pancreas
You don’t see your pancreas very often, but you hear from it all the time. It
has two major functions. One is to produce digestive enzymes, which are the
chemicals in your small intestine that help to break down food. The digestive
enzymes don’t have much relation to diabetes, so I won’t spend much time
talking about them. Your pancreas’s other function is to produce and secrete
directly into the blood a hormone of major importance, insulin. The following
sections explore the ins and outs of your pancreas and insulin so that you’re
well acquainted with both.
Examining your pancreas
Figure 3-1 shows the microscopic appearance of the pancreas. The following
list explains the different cells found in the pancreas as well as their functions:
 B cells: The insulin-producing pancreas cells (also called beta cells) are
found in groups called Islets of Langerhans. 
 A cells: These glucagon-producing cells (a hormone that is very impor-
tant to people with diabetes because it raises blood glucose when the
glucose level gets too low) are present in the Islets of Langerhans.
 D cells: These cells make somatostatin (a hormone that blocks the secre-
tion of other hormones but doesn’t have a use in diabetes because it
causes high blood sugar and increased ketones by blocking insulin as
well) and like the cells described above, are also found in the Islets of
Langerhans.
Understanding insulin
If you understand only one hormone in your body, insulin should be that hor-
mone (especially if you want to understand diabetes). Over the course of your
life, the insulin that your body produces or the insulin that you inject into
your body (as I describe in Chapter 10) affects whether or not you control the
glucose levels in your blood and avoid the complications of the disease.
30
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

Think of your insulin as an insurance agent, who lives in San Francisco
(which is your pancreas) but travels from there to do business in Seattle
(your muscles), Denver (your fat tissue), Los Angeles (your liver), and other
places. This insulin insurance agent is insuring your good health.
Wherever insulin travels in your body, it opens up the cells so that glucose
can enter them. After glucose enters, the cells can immediately use it for
energy, store it in a storage form of glucose (called glycogen) for rapid use
later on, or convert it to fat for use even later as energy.
After glucose leaves your blood and enters your cells, your blood glucose
level falls. Your pancreas can tell when your glucose is falling, and it turns off
the release of insulin to prevent unhealthy low levels of blood glucose called
hypoglycemia (see Chapter 4). At the same time, your liver begins to release
glucose from storage and makes new glucose from amino acids in your blood.
If your insurance agent (insulin, remember? — stick with me here!) doesn’t
show up when you need him (meaning that you have an absence of insulin, 
as in type 1 diabetes) or he does a poor job when he shows up (such as when
you have a resistance to insulin, as in type 2 diabetes), your insurance cover-
age may be very poor (in which case your blood glucose starts to climb).
High blood glucose is the beginning of all your problems.
Doctors have proven that high blood glucose is bad for you and that keeping
the blood glucose as normal as possible prevents the complications of dia-
betes (which I explain in Part II). Most treatments for diabetes are directed at
restoring the blood glucose to normal.

Chapter 3: What Type of Diabetes Do You Have?

Type 1 Diabetes and You
John Phillips, a 6-year-old boy, was always very active, and his parents
became concerned when the counselors at summer camp told them that he
seemed to not have much energy. When he got home from camp, John’s par-
ents noticed that he was thirsty all the time and running to the bathroom. He
was very hungry but seemed to be losing weight, despite eating more than
enough. John’s parents took him to the pediatrician, who did several blood
glucose tests and told them that their son has type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM),
which used to be called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes.
This story has a happy ending because John’s parents were willing to do the
necessary things to bring John’s glucose under control. John is just as ener-
getic as ever, but he has had to get used to a few inconveniences in his daily
routine. (I cover such daily lifestyle changes in Part III.) The following sec-
tions detail the symptoms and causes of this type of diabetes.
Identifying symptoms of type 1 diabetes
Following are some of the major signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes. If
you experience the following symptoms, ask your doctor about the possibil-
ity that you have diabetes:
 Frequent urination: You experience frequent urination because your
kidneys can’t return all the glucose to your bloodstream when your
blood glucose level is greater than 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/L). (See Chapter
7 for all the details on blood glucose level testing.) The large amount of
glucose in your urine makes the urine very concentrated. As a result,
your body draws water out of your blood and into the urine to reduce
that high concentration of glucose. This water and glucose fill up the
bladder repeatedly.
 Increase in thirst: Your thirst increases as you experience frequent uri-
nation, because you lose so much water in the urine that your body
begins to dehydrate.
 Weight loss: You lose weight as your body loses glucose in the urine and
your body breaks down muscle and fat looking for energy.
 Increase in hunger: Your body has plenty of extra glucose in the blood,
but your cells become malnourished because you lack insulin to allow
the glucose to enter your cells. As a result, you become increasingly
hungry. Your body goes through “hunger in the midst of plenty.”
 Weakness: You feel weak because your muscle cells and other tissues do
not get the energy that they require from glucose.
32
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile diabetes because it occurs most
frequently in children. However, so many cases are found in adults that doc-
tors don’t use the term juvenile any more. Some children are diagnosed early
in life, and other children have a more severe onset of the disease as they get
a little older.
With children over age ten, the early signs and symptoms of diabetes may
have been missed by parents, counselors, or teachers. These kids have a
great deal of fat breakdown in their bodies to provide energy, and this fat
breakdown creates other problems. Ketone bodies, products of the break-
down of fats, begin to accumulate in the blood and spill into the urine.
Ketone bodies are acidic and lead to nausea, abdominal pain, and sometimes
vomiting.
At the same time as fat is breaking down, the child’s blood glucose rises
higher. Dangerous levels as high as 400 to 600 mg/dl (22.2 to 33.3 mmol/L) are
not uncommon, but levels as low as 300 (16.6 mmol/L), not quite as danger-
ous are possible. The child’s blood is like thick maple syrup and doesn’t cir-
culate as freely as normal. The large amount of water leaving the body with
the glucose depletes important substances such as sodium and potassium.
The vomiting causes the child to lose more fluids and body substances. All
these abnormalities cause the child to become very drowsy and possibly lose
consciousness. This situation is called diabetic ketoacidosis, and if it isn’t
identified and corrected quickly, the child can die. (See Chapter 4 for more
details on the symptoms, causes, and treatments of ketoacidosis.)
A few special circumstances affect the symptoms that you may see in per-
sons with type 1 diabetes. Remember the following factors:
 The “honeymoon” period is a time after the diagnosis of diabetes when
the person’s insulin needs decline for one to six months and the disease
seems to get milder. The honeymoon period is longer when a child is
older at the time of diagnosis, but the apparent diminishing of the dis-
ease is always temporary.
 Males and females get type 1 diabetes to an equal degree.
 Warm summer months are associated with a decrease in the occurrence
of diabetes compared to the winter months, particularly in older chil-
dren over ten. The probable reason for this occurrence is that a virus is
involved in bringing on diabetes (which I discuss in the next section),
and viruses spread much more when children are learning and playing
together inside in the winter.
33
Chapter 3: What Type of Diabetes Do You Have?

Investigating the causes 
of type 1 diabetes
When your doctor diagnoses you with type 1 diabetes, you almost certainly
will wonder what could have caused you to acquire the disease. Did someone
with diabetes sneeze on you? Did you eat so much sugary food that your
body reacted by giving you diabetes? Rest assured that the causes of dia-
betes aren’t so simple.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, meaning that your body is unkind
enough to react against — and, in this case, destroy — a vital part of itself,
namely the insulin-producing beta (B) cells of the pancreas. One way that
doctors discovered that type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease is by mea-
suring proteins in the blood, called antibodies, which are literally substances
directed against your body — and, in particular, against your islet cells.
(These specific antibodies are called islet cell antibodies and GAD antibodies.)
Doctors find islet cell antibodies and GAD antibodies in relatives of people
who have type 1 diabetes and in the people with diabetes themselves for a
few years before the disease begins.
Another clue that type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease is that drugs that
reduce autoimmunity, also delay the onset of type 1 diabetes. Also, type 1 dia-
betes tends to occur in people who have other known autoimmune diseases.
You may wonder how doctors can know in advance that certain people will
develop diabetes. The method of predicting isn’t 100 percent accurate, but
people who get type 1 diabetes more often have certain abnormal character-
istics on their genetic material, their chromosomes, that are not present in
people who don’t get diabetes. Doctors can look for these abnormal charac-
teristics on your DNA. But having these abnormal characteristics doesn’t
guarantee that you’ll get diabetes.
Another essential factor in predicting whether you will develop diabetes is
your exposure to something in the environment, most likely a virus. I discuss
this factor in detail in the next section.
Getting type 1 diabetes
To develop diabetes, most people also have to come in contact with some-
thing in the environment that triggers the destruction of their beta cells, the
cells that make insulin. Doctors think that this environmental trigger is prob-
ably a virus, and they’ve identified several viruses that may be to blame.
34
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

Doctors think they are the same viruses that cause the common cold.
Persons with type 1 diabetes probably get the virus just like any cold virus —
from someone else who has the virus who sneezes on them. But because they
also have the genetic tendency, they get type 1 diabetes.
This type of virus can cause diabetes by attacking your pancreas directly and
diminishing your ability to produce insulin, which quickly creates the dia-
betic condition in your body. The virus can also cause diabetes if it is made
up of a substance that is also naturally present in your pancreas. If the virus
and your pancreas possess the same substance, the antibodies that your
body produces to fight off the virus will also attack the shared substance in
your pancreas, leaving you in the same condition as if the virus itself
attacked your pancreas.
A small number (about 10 percent) of patients who develop type 1 diabetes
don’t seem to need an environmental factor to trigger the diabetes. In them,
the disease is entirely an autoimmune destruction of the beta cells. If you fall
into this category of people with diabetes, you may have other autoimmune
diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid disease.
You may be curious about how likely you are to get type 1 diabetes if some-
one in your immediate family has it. Studies of many families have provided
fairly good answers to this question. Here are some facts about the genetics
of diabetes:
 You get half of your total genetic material from each parent, but if one of
your parents has type 1 diabetes, the odds are only 3 to 4 percent that
you will get it.
 If you and your sibling are identical twins (meaning that you have exactly
the same genetic material), you have about a 20 percent chance of get-
ting type 1 diabetes if your sibling develops the disease.
 If you have only half of your genetic material in common with your sib-
ling who has type 1 diabetes (meaning you are a fraternal twin rather
than an identical twin), your chance of getting type 1 diabetes drops to 
5 percent.
 If none of the genetic material associated with diabetes is the same 
as your sibling with type 1 diabetes, your chance of developing type 1 
diabetes is less than 1 percent.
These relatively low chances of both siblings getting diabetes clearly show
that more factors than your genetic inheritance from your parents are
involved in acquiring type 1 diabetes. Otherwise, identical twins would both
have type 1 diabetes almost 100 percent of the time.
35
Chapter 3: What Type of Diabetes Do You Have?

Preventing type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes is an excellent candidate for two types of preventative treat-
ments that should be available to patients in the not-too-distant future:
 In order to prevent diabetes, you will be able to undergo treatments
before the disease starts, which is a method called primary prevention.
Possible candidates for primary prevention are people with family histo-
ries of type 1 diabetes. If you fall into that category, your doctor can ana-
lyze your DNA to see whether you have the genetic material most often
found in people who have diabetes. If you do, you could receive primary
prevention to block the disease.
 Secondary prevention is treatment that is given to a person with diabetes
after the disease is triggered but before the person becomes sick. In
order to try secondary prevention, your doctor must be able to recog-
nize that diabetes has begun, even though you aren’t sick. And months
to years must pass between diagnosis and the onset of symptoms in
order to have enough time for the treatment to prevent sickness. 
An example of primary prevention for type 1 diabetes would be vaccination
against the viruses that may be associated with diabetes. Unfortunately, doc-
tors haven’t yet pinpointed the exact virus or viruses, so vaccinations aren’t
yet practical. Doctors have tried vaccinations in countries (such as Finland)
where type 1 diabetes occurs most often, but the vaccinations didn’t stop the
number of new cases of type 1 diabetes from rising. Doctors also have con-
sidered giving antiviral agents to people who are at high risk of acquiring dia-
betes, but this approach, although successful, has been tested only in
animals so far.
You may think that all the recent scientific advances in gene research would
enable doctors to change people’s genetic material to prevent the onset of
type 1 diabetes. Although scientists have made great strides in identifying the
genes associated with diabetes, they haven’t quite reached the point where
they can change those genes. Such methods for primary prevention of type 1
diabetes are something for the future.
Some doctors believe that certain chemicals in cow’s milk bring on type 1
diabetes. Researchers are comparing breastfed babies who are susceptible to
type 1 diabetes to susceptible babies who are given cow’s milk. They haven’t
yet determined whether cow’s milk is a factor that causes type 1 diabetes. If
cow’s milk turns out to be the culprit, type 1 diabetes could be prevented by
using only breast milk up to a certain age.
36
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

Lots of trials of secondary prevention are underway, though most show only
partial success. Most of these trials make use of doctors’ knowledge that
patients whose bodies produce autoantibodies have type 1 diabetes and that
the antibodies are gradually destroying their insulin-producing beta cells.
Therefore, the treatment is aimed at preventing the production of antibodies.
In these patients, full-blown type 1 diabetes may take a couple of years to
appear and create major problems, so the doctor has time to intervene.
The most prevalent methods of secondary prevention for type 1 diabetes
attempt to block the autoimmune disease from destroying all of your pan-
creas’s beta cells. The following list shows some of the more promising sec-
ondary prevention trials and techniques:
 Steroid drugs: You can take steroid drugs, such as prednisone, to block
autoimmune conditions. When doctors find islet cell antibodies in a
person with type 1 diabetes, they give the person these steroids, which
reduce the amount of islet cell antibodies and seem to prolong the
period between the development of the antibodies and the onset of
symptoms, such as excessive thirst and urination.
But this approach isn’t 100 percent successful, and it could have many
side effects — especially in children under ten. Small children who use
steroids suffer from growth problems, infections, and other unwanted
side effects. If diabetes becomes active, the reason may be the failure of
the steroid to prevent the autoimmune destruction of the pancreas, as
well as the glucose abnormalities caused by the steroid itself.
 Cytotoxic drugs: Ccytotoxic drugs, another group of drugs used to
increase the time between antibodies and diseases, act against the cells
that may participate in the destruction of the pancreatic beta cells.
Again, studies have shown only a slowing down of the time between anti-
bodies and symptoms. Cytotoxic drugs destroy various types of cells —
and not just the bad cells. Studies of cytotoxic drugs have all been com-
plicated by side effects that were severe and damaging to some of the
patients.
 Nicotinamide: In animal studies, nicotinamide (a B vitamin) protects the
beta cells of mice that are diabetes-prone. A similar trial in humans was
somewhat successful, showing that 20 percent of patients using nicoti-
namide didn’t develop symptoms of diabetes and didn’t lose as many
beta cells. Doctors are surprised that a drug known to raise plasma glu-
cose (see Chapter 2) could prevent diabetes.
 Insulin: In another study, small amounts of insulin were given to people
who have islet cell antibodies, in an attempt to prolong the time
between antibodies and symptoms. This approach initially showed
some promise, but further into the study, there has been no difference in
the development of diabetes between those given insulin and those who
did not receive it.
37
Chapter 3: What Type of Diabetes Do You Have?

The most important study of prevention ever done for type 1 diabetes is
called the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), published in
1993. The DCCT showed that keeping very tight control over your blood glu-
cose is possible but difficult. The difficult part of keeping your blood glucose
close to normal is that you increase your risk of having low blood glucose, or
hypoglycemia (see Chapter 4). The DCCT study showed that you can prevent
the complications of diabetes — including eye, kidney, and nerve disease —
by keeping your blood glucose as close to normal as possible. If you already
suffer from such complications, improving your blood glucose control very
significantly slows the progression of the complications. Since the DCCT, doc-
tors generally treat type 1 diabetes by keeping the patient’s blood glucose as
close to normal as is possible and as is practical.
If you would like to read much more on the subject of type 1 diabetes, please

Having Type 2 Diabetes
Edythe Fokel, a 46-year-old woman, has gained about 10 pounds in the last
year, so that her 5-foot 5-inch body now weighs about 155 pounds. Edythe
doesn’t do much exercise. She has felt somewhat fatigued recently, but she
blames her age and approaching menopause. She also blames the fact that
she now gets up several times a night to urinate, which she didn’t used to do.
She is disturbed because her vision is blurry, and her job requires working on
a computer. Finally, Edythe goes to her gynecologist after developing a rash
and discharge in her vagina. When Edythe describes her symptoms, her gyne-
cologist decides to do a blood glucose test. He refers her back to her primary
physician when Edythe’s blood glucose level registers at 220 mg/dl (12.2
mmol/L).
Edythe’s primary doctor asks her whether other members of her family have
had diabetes, and she replies that her mother and a sister are both being
treated for it. The doctor also asks Edythe about any tingling in her feet, and
she admits that she has noticed some tingling for the past few months but
didn’t think it was important. The primary doctor repeats the random blood
glucose test, which comes back at 260 mg/dl (14.4 mmol/L). He informs
Edythe that she has type 2 diabetes.
The signs and symptoms that Edythe manifests in this scenario, along with
the results of the two blood glucose tests, provide a textbook picture of type
2 diabetes. (Type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult onset diabetes or non-
insulin dependent diabetes.) But be aware that people with type 2 diabetes
may have few or none of these symptoms. Because of the varying symptoms
it is important for your doctor to check your blood glucose level on a regular
basis. (I discuss how often you should do this test in Chapter 7.)
38
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

Most people with type 2 diabetes are over the age of forty. Your chances of
getting type 2 diabetes increase as you get older. Because the symptoms are
so mild at first, you may not notice them. You may ignore these symptoms 
for years before they become bothersome enough to consult your doctor. 
So type 2 diabetes is a disease of gradual onset rather than the severe emer-
gency that can herald type 1 diabetes. No autoimmunity is involved in type 2
diabetes, so no antibodies are found. Doctors believe that no virus is
involved in the onset of type 2 diabetes.
Recent statistics show that worldwide, ten times more people have type 2
diabetes than type 1 diabetes. Although type 2 is the much more prevalent
type of diabetes, those with type 2 diabetes seem to have milder severity of
complications (such as eye disease and kidney disease) from diabetes. (See
Part II for details about the possible complications of diabetes. See Part III for
treatments that can help you prevent these complications.)
Identifying symptoms of type 2 diabetes
A fairly large percentage of the U.S. population (approximately 20 million
people) has type 2 diabetes. The numbers are on the rise, and one reason is
an increase in the incidence of obesity, a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes.
If you’re obese, you are considerably more likely to acquire type 2 diabetes
than you would be if you maintained your ideal weight. (See Chapter 8 for the
details on how to figure out your weight classification.)
The following signs and symptoms are good indicators that you have type 2
diabetes. If you experience two or more of these symptoms, call your doctor:
 Fatigue: Type 2 diabetes makes you tired because your body’s cells
aren’t getting the glucose fuel that they need. Even though there is
plenty of insulin in your blood, your body is resistant to its actions. (See
the “Getting to Know Your Pancreas” section for more explanation.)
 Frequent urination and thirst: As with type 1 diabetes, you find yourself
urinating more frequently than usual, which dehydrates your body and
leaves you thirsty.
 Blurred vision: The lenses of your eyes swell and shrink as your blood
glucose levels rise and fall. Your vision blurs because your eyes can’t
adjust quickly enough to these lens changes.
 Slow healing of skin, gum, and urinary infections: Your white blood
cells, which help with healing and defend your body against infections,
don’t function correctly in the high-glucose environment present in your
body when it has diabetes. Unfortunately, the bugs that cause infections
thrive in the same high-glucose environment. So diabetes leaves your
body especially susceptible to infections.
39
Chapter 3: What Type of Diabetes Do You Have?

 Genital itching: Yeast infections also love a high-glucose environment.
So diabetes is often accompanied by the itching and discomfort of yeast
infections.
 Numbness in the feet or legs: You experience numbness because of a
common long-term complication of diabetes called neuropathy. (I explain
the details of neuropathy in Chapter 5.) If you notice numbness and neu-
ropathy along with the other symptoms of diabetes, you probably have
had the disease for quite a while, because neuropathy takes more than
five years to develop in a diabetic environment. Occasionally numbness
occurs earlier when there are extreme elevations of the glucose.
 Heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease: Heart disease,
stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (blockage of arteries in the legs)
occur much more often in type 2s than in the nondiabetic population.
But these complications may appear when you are merely glucose-
intolerant (which I explain in the next section), before you actually 
have diagnosable diabetes.
The signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes are similar in some cases to the
symptoms of type 1 diabetes (which I cover in the “Identifying symptoms of
type 1 diabetes” section, earlier in this chapter), but in many ways they are
different. The following list shows some of the differences between symp-
toms in type 1 and type 2 diabetes:
 Age of onset: People with type 1 diabetes are usually younger than
those with type 2 diabetes. However, the increasing incidence of type 2
diabetes in overweight children is making this difference less useful for
separating type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
 Body weight: Those with type 1 diabetes are usually thin or normal in
weight, but obesity is a common characteristic of people with type 2 
diabetes.
 Level of glucose: People with type 1 diabetes have higher glucose levels
at the onset of the disease. Those with type 1 diabetes usually have
blood glucose levels of 300 to 400 mg/dl (16.6 to 22.2 mmol/L), and those
with type 2 diabetes usually have blood glucose levels of 200 to 250
mg/dl (11.1 to 13.9 mmol/L).
 Severity of onset: Type 1 diabetes usually has a much more severe
onset, but type 2 diabetes gradually shows its symptoms.
Investigating the causes of type 2 diabetes
If you’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you’re probably shocked and
curious about why you developed the disease. Doctors have learned quite a
bit about the causes of type 2 diabetes. For example, they know that type 2
diabetes runs in families.
40
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

Usually, people with type 2 diabetes can find a relative who has had the 
disease. Therefore, doctors consider type 2 diabetes to be much more of a
genetic disease than type 1 diabetes. In studies of identical twins, when one
twin has type 2 diabetes, the likelihood that type 2 diabetes will develop in
the other twin is nearly 100 percent.
Insulin resistance
People with type 2 diabetes have plenty of insulin in their bodies (unlike
people with type 1 diabetes), but their bodies respond to the insulin in
abnormal ways. Those with type 2 diabetes are insulin-resistant, meaning that
their bodies resist the normal, healthy functioning of insulin. This resistance,
combined with not having enough insulin to overcome the insulin resistance,
causes type 2 diabetes.
Before obesity or lack of exercise (or diabetes for that matter) is present,
future type 2 patients already show signs of insulin resistance. First, the
amount of insulin in their blood is elevated compared to normal people.
Second, a shot of insulin doesn’t reduce the blood glucose in these insulin-
resistant people nearly as much as it does in people without insulin resis-
tance. (See Chapter 10 to find out more about insulin shots in diabetes.)
When your body needs to make extra insulin just to keep your blood glucose
normal, your insulin is, obviously, less effective than it should be — which
means that you have impaired glucose tolerance. Your body goes through
impaired glucose tolerance before you actually have diabetes, because your
blood glucose is still lower than the levels needed for a diagnosis of diabetes
(see Chapter 2). When you have impaired glucose tolerance and you add
other factors such as weight gain, a sedentary lifestyle, and aging, your pan-
creas can’t keep up with your insulin demands, and you develop diabetes.
Another factor that comes into play when doctors make a diagnosis of type 2
diabetes is the release of sugar from the glycogen stored in your liver, known
as your hepatic glucose output. People with type 2 diabetes have high glucose
levels in the morning after having fasted all night. You would think that your
glucose would be low in the morning if you haven’t eaten any sugar. But your
liver is a storage bank for a lot of glucose, and it can make even more from
other substances in the body. As your insulin resistance increases, your liver
begins to release glucose inappropriately, and your fasting blood glucose
level rises.
Mistaken beliefs about type 2
People often think that the following factors cause type 2 diabetes, but they
actually have nothing to do with the onset of the disease:
41
Chapter 3: What Type of Diabetes Do You Have?

 Sugar: Eating excessive amounts of sugar does not cause diabetes, but it
may bring out the disease to the extent that it makes you fat. Eating too
much protein or fat will do the same thing.
 Emotions: Changes in your emotions do not play a large role in the
development of type 2 diabetes, but they may be very important in deal-
ing with diabetes mellitus and subsequent control.
 Stress: Too much stress isn’t a major factor that causes diabetes.
 Antibodies: Antibodies against islet cells are not a major factor in type 2
diabetes (see the section “Investigating the causes of type 1 diabetes,”
earlier in this chapter). Type 2 diabetes isn’t an autoimmune disease like
type 1.
 Gender: Males and females are equally as likely to develop type 2 dia-
betes. Gender doesn’t play a role in the onset of this disease.
 Diabetic ketoacidosis: Type 2 diabetes isn’t generally associated with
diabetic ketoacidosis (see Chapter 4). People with type 2 diabetes are
ketosis resistant, except under extremely severe stress caused by infec-
tions or trauma. (See Chapter 4 for a discussion of hyperosmolar syn-
drome, a related condition in which people with type 2 diabetes have
extremely high glucose but don’t have the fat breakdown that leads to
acidosis.)
Getting type 2 diabetes
Genetic inheritance is necessary in type 2 diabetes, but environmental fac-
tors such as obesity and lack of exercise trigger the disease. People with 
type 2 diabetes are insulin-resistant before they become obese or sedentary.
Aging, poor eating habits, obesity, and failure to exercise combine to bring
out the disease.
Inheritance seems to be a much stronger factor in type 2 diabetes than in
type 1 diabetes. Consider the following:
 If your father has type 2 diabetes but your mother doesn’t, you have
about a 4 percent chance of getting the disease.
 If your mother has type 2 diabetes but your father doesn’t, your chances
of getting it leap to about 10 percent.
 Nearly 100 percent of the time, an identical twin of a person with type 2
diabetes eventually gets the disease.
 If your brother or sister (not an identical twin) gets type 2, you have
about a 40 percent chance of doing the same.
42
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

Here’s an interesting fact: Spouses of people with type 2 diabetes are at
higher risk of developing diabetes and should be screened just like relatives
of people with diabetes. Why? Because they share the environmental risk fac-
tors for diabetes, such as poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. If your wife is a
good cook and you have a big-screen TV, watch out!
Some early warning signs appear in the population that is most at risk to
develop type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes often have a history 
of malnutrition at a young age. Perhaps these people didn’t make enough
insulin-producing cells when they were young, because they didn’t need
them for their reduced food intake. When someone like this is presented 
with ample supplies of food at an older age, his or her pancreas may not 
have enough insulin-producing cells to handle the load.
In developing countries, where people often don’t get enough food, those
whose genetic makeup enables their bodies to use carbohydrates in a very
efficient manner have an advantage over the rest of the population because
they can survive on the low food and calorie supplies. However, if these
people later receive ample supplies of food, their bodies are overwhelmed
and they’re likely to become fat and sedentary and develop diabetes. This
fact may explain why people in developing countries are the most at risk to
develop type 2 diabetes. Population studies show that the incidence of dia-
betes is greatest in developing countries such as China and India.
Preventing type 2 diabetes
Doctors can predict type 2 diabetes years in advance of its actual diagnosis
by studying the close relatives of people who have the condition. This early
warning period offers plenty of time to try techniques of primary prevention
(which I explain in the “Preventing type 1 diabetes” section, earlier in this
chapter). After a doctor discovers that someone’s blood glucose levels are
high and diagnoses type 2 diabetes, complications such as eye disease and
kidney disease (see Chapter 5) usually take ten or more years to develop in
that person. During this time, doctors can apply secondary prevention tech-
niques (the various treatments I discuss in Part III).
Because so many people suffer from type 2 diabetes, doctors have had a
wealth of people to study in order to determine the most important environ-
mental factors that turn a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes into a
clinical disease. The following are the major environmental factors:
 High body mass index: The body mass index (BMI) is the way that doc-
tors look at weight in relation to height. BMI is a better indicator of a
healthy weight than just weight alone, because, for instance, a person 
who weighs 150 pounds and is 62 inches tall is overweight, but a 
person who weighs 150 pounds and is 70 inches tall is thin.
43
Chapter 3: What Type of Diabetes Do You Have?

You can easily determine your BMI by using the following formula:
Multiply your weight (in pounds) by 703, then divide that number by
your height (in inches). Divide that result by your height (in inches)
again. If you use the metric system, divide your weight in kilograms by
your height in meters and divide that result by your height in meters
again. Using this formula, the 150-pound person with a height of 62
inches has a BMI of 27.5, while the person with the height of 70 inches
has a BMI of 21.6. The result is expressed in kilograms per meter
squared (kg/m2).
Current guidelines state that a person with a BMI from 25 to 29.9 is over-
weight, and a person with a BMI of 30 or greater is obese. A BMI between
20 and 25 is considered normal. A person with a BMI of 40 or higher has
morbid obesity.
Many studies have verified the great importance of the BMI level in
determining who gets diabetes. For example, a large study of thousands
of nurses in the United States showed that nurses with a BMI greater
than 35 had diabetes almost 100 times more often than nurses with a
BMI less than 22. Even among the women in this study considered to be
lean, those with the higher BMI, though still in the category of lean, had
three times the prevalence of diabetes compared to those with lower
BMI. Another large study of U.S. physicians found the same relationship
of high BMI to high levels of type 2 diabetes. The same study showed
that the length of time that you’re obese is important; participants who
were obese ten years earlier were more likely to have diabetes than
those who had become obese more recently.
 Physical inactivity: Physical inactivity has a high association with dia-
betes, as evidenced in many studies. Former athletes have diabetes less
often than nonathletes. The same study of nurses’ health that I cite in
the preceding bullet showed that women who were physically active on
a regular basis had diabetes only two-thirds as often as the couch pota-
toes. A study conducted in Hawaii, which did not include any obese
people, showed that the occurrence of diabetes was greatest for people
who don’t exercise.
 Central distribution of fat: When people with diabetes become fat, they
tend to carry the extra weight as centrally distributed fat, also known as
visceral fat. You check your visceral fat when you measure your waist-
line, because this type of fat stays around your midsection. So a person
with visceral fat is more apple-shaped than pear-shaped. Visceral fat
also happens to be the type of fat that probably comes and goes most
easily on your body, and it is relatively easy to lose when you diet.
Visceral fat seems to cause more insulin resistance than fat in other
areas, and it is also correlated with the occurrence of coronary artery
44
Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 

disease. If you have a lot of visceral fat, losing just 5 to 10 percent of
your weight may very dramatically reduce your chance of diabetes or a
heart attack.
If you are 40 or younger and your waistline measures 39.5 inches (100
centimeters) or greater, or you are between the ages of 40 and 60 and
your waistline measures 35.5 inches (90 centimeters) or more, you have
a significantly increased risk of a heart attack.
Asians tend to develop visceral fat at a lower weight than non-Asians
and are therefore more prone to type 2 diabetes at a lower weight. Asian
Indians are particularly susceptible, developing diabetes up to ten years
earlier than Chinese and Japanese.
 Low intake of dietary fiber: Populations with a high prevalence of 
diabetes tend to eat a diet that is low in fiber. Dietary fiber seems to 
be protective against diabetes, because it slows down the rate at which
glucose enters the bloodstream.
If you recognize any of the preceding factors in your body or lifestyle, you
can correct them in time to prevent diabetes. Type 2 diabetes allows the
high-risk individual or the diagnosed person the time to work toward preven-
tion or control of the disease. In Part III, I show you specific ways to reduce
your weight, increase your exercise, improve your diet, and prevent or
reverse diabetes and diabetic complications.
Recognizing a variant of type 2 diabetes
As many as 10 percent of people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes do not
respond well to medications that stimulate the pancreas to release more
insulin like the sulfonylurea class of drugs (see Chapter 10). When they are
tested they are found to have GAD antibodies similar to those found in T1DM.
This condition is really adult-onset T1DM rather than T2DM. The treatment is
similar to that for T1DM.
These patients are divided by their level of GAD antibodies into two groups.
The ones who are higher than 32 GAD units have more severe diabetes that 
is harder to control. Those with lower levels of GAD have milder diabetes,
suggesting they have some remaining pancreatic ability to make and release
insulin.
If you are having trouble with controlling your diabetes with oral drugs that
work by causing more insulin release, ask your doctor to test you for GAD
antibodies.

Part I: Dealing with the Onset of Diabetes 
Possibilities for future prevention of diabetes
Researchers have performed many valuable
studies on the prevention of type 2 diabetes. The
results of these studies suggest that you can
prevent diabetes, but probably only by making
major lifestyle changes and sticking to them
over a long period of time. Here are some impor-
tant conclusions based on prevention research:
 Taking drugs that don’t treat your insulin
resistance doesn’t help to prevent your dia-
betes or its complications.
 If you exercise regularly, you may delay the
onset of diabetes.
 If you maintain a proper diet and exercise
regularly, you can delay the onset of diabetes
and slow the complications that may occur.
 Controlling both your blood pressure and
your blood glucose has substantial benefits
for preventing the complications of diabetes.
A study reported in the New England Journal of
Medicine in July 1991 confirmed the preceding
conclusions by looking at obese people who had
close relatives with type 2 diabetes — which
meant that these people were highly likely to
develop diabetes. For six months, the
researchers gave the participants extensive
training in exercise routines and maintaining
proper diet. Many of the participants lost signifi-
cant amounts of weight, improved their overall
health, and staved off the development of dia-
betes. But after six months, many of the people
being studied were no longer participating as
fully and sticking as closely to the diet and exer-
cise regimens. By the time twelve months of the
study had passed, more of the participants were
straying farther from the diet and exercise that
they needed, and they were regaining some of
the weight they had lost. The researchers found
that the people who were able to maintain the
proper diet and exercise — which helped them
not to gain weight — were least likely to develop
diabetes. The main point I want to make is that
this study proves the importance (and, for many
people, the difficulty) of maintaining a program of
diet and exercise for a long period of time.
The results of the Diabetes Prevention Program,
a study of more than 3,000 people, were pub-
lished in the New England Journal of Medicine
in February 2002. They clearly showed that diet
and exercise are effective in preventing type 2
diabetes. Participants who successfully modi-
fied their diet and exercise routines reduced
their chances of developing type 2 diabetes by
58 percent. They generally did thirty minutes of
moderate exercise (like walking) every day and
lost between 5 and 7 percent of their body
weight during the three-year study period. In
contrast, patients who used a drug called met-
formin (see Chapter 10) without modifying their
diet and exercise reduced their risk of develop-
ing type 2 diabetes by only 31 percent.
Another recent study, the Finnish Diabetes
Prevention Study (reported in Diabetes Care in
December 2003), shows that lifestyle changes
can be accomplished and sustained not only in
a research setting (like that of the Diabetes
Prevention Program) but in a community setting
as well, where patients are taken care of by their
own doctors. Study participants worked with a
nutritionist to improve their diets and received
some advice on exercise. They continue to be
successful after three years, with the same 58
percent reduction in the onset of diabetes.
Restoring insulin sensitivity in people at risk for
prediabetes (see Chapter 2) was the focus of
another recent study, published in Diabetes
Care in March 2002. This study compared inten-
sive lifestyle change, both diet and exercise,
with moderate lifestyle change. The intensive
group ate less fat and did more vigorous exer-
cise than the moderate group, and every
member of the intensive group increased his or
her insulin sensitivity, which resulted in holding
off the development of diabetes.

Having Gestational Diabetes
If you’re pregnant (yes, that excludes you men) and you’ve never had dia-
betes before, during your pregnancy you could acquire a form of diabetes
called gestational diabetes. If you already have diabetes when you become
pregnant, that is called pregestational diabetes. As I discuss in Chapter 6, the
difference between pregestational diabetes and gestational diabetes is very
important in terms of the consequences for both mother and baby.
Gestational diabetes occurs in about 2 percent of all pregnancies.
During your pregnancy, you can acquire gestational diabetes because the
growing fetus and the placenta create various hormones to help the fetus
grow and develop properly. Some of these hormones have other characteris-
tics, such as anti-insulin properties, that decrease your body’s sensitivity to
insulin, increase glucose production, and can cause diabetes.
At approximately your 20th week of pregnancy, your body produces enough
of these hormones to block your insulin’s normal actions and cause diabetes.
After you give birth, when the fetus and placenta are no longer in your body,
their anti-insulin hormones are gone and your diabetes disappears.
Even though gestational diabetes subsides after you give birth, more than
half of the women who experience gestational diabetes develop type 2 dia-
betes within fifteen years after the pregnancy. This high likelihood of type 2
diabetes probably results from a genetic susceptibility to diabetes in these
women, which is magnified by the large amount of anti-insulin hormones in
their bodies during pregnancy.
Your obstetrician should do a test for gestational diabetes around the 24th to
28th week of your pregnancy.
Recognizing Other Types of Diabetes
Cases of diabetes other than type 1, type 2, or gestational are rare and usu-
ally don’t cause severe diabetes in the people who have them. But occasion-
ally one of these other types is responsible for a more severe case of
diabetes, so you should know that they exist. The following list gives you a
brief rundown of the symptoms and causes for other types of diabetes:
 Diabetes due to loss or disease of pancreatic tissue: If you have a 
disease, such as cancer, that necessitates the removal of some of your
pancreas, you lose your pancreas’s valuable insulin-producing beta cells,
and your body becomes diabetic. This form of diabetes isn’t always
47
Chapter 3: What Type of Diabetes Do You Have?

severe because you lose glucagon, another hormone found in your pan-
creas, after your pancreatic surgery. Glucagon blocks insulin action in
your body, so when your body has less glucagon, it can function with
less insulin, leaving you with a milder case of diabetes.
 Diabetes due to iron overload: Another disease that damages the pan-
creas, as well as the liver, the heart, the joints, and the nervous system,
is hemochromatosis. This condition results from excessive absorption of
iron into the blood. When the blood deposits too much iron into these
organs, damage can occur. This hereditary condition is present in 1 of
every 200 people in the United States; half of those who have it develop
a clinical disease, sometimes diabetes.
Hemochromatosis is less common in younger women, who are protected
by the monthly loss of iron that occurs with menstrual bleeding. This
finding has led to the current treatment for hemochromatosis, which is
removing blood from the patient regularly until the blood iron returns to
normal, then repeating the procedure occasionally to keep iron levels
normal. If treatment is done early enough (before organs are damaged),
complications, such as diabetes, are avoidable.
 Diabetes due to other diseases: Your body contains a number of hor-
mones that block insulin action or have actions that are opposed to
insulin’s actions. You produce these hormones in glands other than your
pancreas. If you get a tumor on one of these hormone-producing glands,
the gland sometimes produces excessive levels of the hormones that act
in opposition to insulin. Usually, this condition gives you simple glucose
intolerance rather than diabetes, because your pancreas makes extra
insulin to combat the hormones. But if you have a genetic tendency to
develop diabetes, you may develop diabetes in this case.
 Diabetes due to hormone treatments for other diseases: If you take
hormones to treat a disease other than diabetes, those hormones could
cause diabetes in your body. The hormone that is most likely to cause
diabetes in this situation is hydrocortisone, an anti-inflammatory agent
used in diseases of inflammation, such as arthritis. (Similar drugs are
prednisone and dexamethasone.) If you take hydrocortisone and you
have the symptoms of diabetes listed in earlier sections of this chapter,
talk to your doctor.
 Diabetes due to other drugs: If you’re taking other commonly used
drugs, be aware that some of them raise your blood glucose as a side
effect. Some antihypertensive drugs, especially hydrochlorothiazide,
raise your blood glucose level. Niacin, a drug commonly used for lower-
ing cholesterol, also raises your blood glucose. If you have a genetic ten-
dency toward diabetes, taking these drugs may be enough to give you
the disease.

49
Chapter 3: What Type of Diabetes Do You Have?
Conditions and hormones that can lead to diabetes
The following is a partial list of hormones
caused by tumors and their associated condi-
tions:
 Excessive adrenal gland hormone (hydro-
cortisone) is present in Cushing’s Syndrome.
Hydrocortisone stimulates the liver to put out
more glucose while it blocks the uptake of
glucose by muscle tissue.
 Excessive prolactin is present in a prolactin
secreting tumor of the pituitary gland. It
blocks insulin action, and glucose intoler-
ance results.
 Excessive growth hormone is made by a
tumor of the pituitary gland resulting in
acromegaly. Growth hormone reduces
insulin sensitivity and forces the pancreas
to make much more insulin.
 Excessive epinephrine is made by a
pheochromocytoma (a tumor of another
part of the adrenal gland). It causes
increased liver production of glucose, while
it blocks insulin secretion.
 Excessive aldosterone is made by still
another part of the adrenal gland in a con-
dition called primary hyperaldosteronism.
This condition causes glucose intolerance
in a different way — by facilitating the loss
of body potassium, which has a negative
effect on insulin production.
 Excessive thyroid hormone found in hyper-
thyroidism causes the liver and other
organs to produce excessive quantities of
glucose. Hyperthyroidism is also a disease
of autoimmunity, which may play a role in
the loss of glucose tolerance.
 A glucagon secreting tumor of the pancreas
can create excessive glucagon. Glucagon
has many properties that are opposite to
insulin. This condition is rare; only around 100
cases of it have been described in medical
literature, so don’t lose sleep over this one.
 A somatostatin secreting tumor of the pan-
creas can create excessive somatostatin.
Somatostatin is another hormone made in a
cell present in the Islets of Langerhans.
Somatostatin actually blocks insulin from
leaving the beta cell, but it also blocks
glucagon and other hormones, so the dia-
betes is very mild. This condition occurs
even less often than the glucagon secreting
tumor.

How Diabetes
Affects Your Body

In this part . . .
D
iabetes can affect every part of your body, but espe-
cially the eyes, the kidneys, the nervous system, 
and the heart. None of this need ever happen. This part
explains these effects, how they occur, the kinds of symp-
toms they produce, and what you and your doctor need to
do to treat them. Remember that everything I describe in
this part is preventable, and even if you have not been
able to prevent them, they’re very treatable.
The effects mentioned above are due to hyperglycemia or
high blood glucose and occur only after years. This part
has lots of information about hypoglycemia or low blood
glucose that often occurs at the beginning of treatment
and is usually due to over-treatment. I discuss at length a
condition called the metabolic syndrome that predates dia-
betes but can cause heart disease. And speaking of length,
I also describe in detail the new drugs available to treat
erection problems resulting from diabetes. It is important
that you know about the effects and respond to them
appropriately.

hapters 2 and 3 tell you all about how doctors make a diagnosis of dia-
betes and how they determine which type of diabetes you have. But you
need to understand how diabetes can affect you. The previous chapters
cover some of the signs and symptoms of diabetes, which you could consider
to be the shortest of the short-term complications of the disease because
they’re generally mild and begin to subside when you start treatment. This
chapter covers the more serious forms of short-term complications of dia-
betes, which occur when your blood glucose is out of control — reaching
dangerously high or low levels.
With the exception of mild hypoglycemia (low blood glucose where you can
manage it yourself), you should treat all the complications in this chapter as
medical emergencies. Don’t try to treat these complications at home. Keep in
touch with your doctor and go to the hospital promptly if your blood glucose
is uncontrollably high or you’re unable to hold down food. You may need a
few hours in the emergency room or a day or two in the hospital to reverse
your problems.
Solving Short-Term Complications
Although the complications that I cover in this chapter are called short-term,
you may experience them at any time during the course of your diabetes.
Short-term simply means that these complications arise rapidly in your body,
as opposed to the long-term complications that take ten or more years to
develop. (See Chapter 5 for all the details about long-term complications.)
Short-term complications develop in days or even hours, and fortunately
they respond to treatment just as rapidly.

Generally, you experience the severe short-term complications associated
with high blood glucose when you aren’t monitoring your blood glucose
levels. Small children and older folks who live alone or have illnesses are
most susceptible to lapses in glucose monitoring and, therefore, to short-
term complications. If you suffer an acute illness or trauma, you should 
monitor your glucose even more frequently than usual because you’re more
vulnerable to short-term complications.
The short-term complications of diabetes affect your ability to function 
normally. For example, if you’re a student, you may have difficulty studying
or taking tests. Or you may have trouble driving your car properly. For this
reason, you may find that the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and the Federal
Aviation Association are extra careful about giving you, and all people with
diabetes, a driver’s license or a pilot’s license. Potential employers may 
question your ability to perform certain jobs. But most companies and gov-
ernment agencies are very enlightened about diabetes and do everything
possible to accommodate you in these situations. (Chapter 15 shows you
how to overcome some challenges that you may face with employment and
insurance.)
You don’t have to feel limited in what you can do. You can control your dia-
betes, and all of the short-term complications are avoidable. If you take your
medication at the appropriate time, eat the proper foods at the proper times,
and monitor your blood glucose regularly, you’re unlikely to suffer from any
severe short-term complications. As you closely monitor and control your
blood glucose, it may drop to lower than normal levels, but monitoring
quickly alerts you to the drop so you can treat it before it affects your mental
and physical functioning. (See Chapter 7 for all the details on glucose moni-
toring and other testing.)
Understanding Hypoglycemia
The condition of having low blood glucose is known as hypoglycemia. If you
have diabetes, you can get hypoglycemia only as a consequence of your dia-
betes treatment.
As a person with diabetes, you’re in constant combat with high blood glu-
cose, which is responsible for most of the long-term and short-term complica-
tions of the disease. Your doctor prescribes drugs and other treatments in an
effort to fine-tune your blood glucose as it would be in the body of a person
who does not have diabetes. (Part III explains many techniques that help you
control your blood glucose levels.) But, unfortunately, these drugs and treat-
ments aren’t always perfect. If you take too much of a drug, exercise too
much, or eat too little, your blood glucose can drop to the low levels at which
symptoms develop. The following sections explain more about the serious-
ness of hypoglycemia as well as its symptoms, causes, and treatment.
54
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

The seriousness of hypoglycemia
One of the readers who wrote to thank me for the first edition of this book
told me how her son had once gone on a blind date. He and his date went to a
bar where they had a drink before dinner. As he sat there, he began to say,
“Sugar, baby, sugar, baby, sugar, baby.” At first his date was offended until she
realized that he had a glazed look in his eyes and found that he was wearing a
bracelet identifying him as a person with diabetes. He was suffering from
hypoglycemia and needed glucose.
This story is amusing, but the subject is very serious. Hypoglycemia can ruin
your day and leave you feeling dazed and exhausted afterwards. You also run
the risk of overtreating it, leaving yourself with a very high blood glucose.
Hypoglycemia is a barrier that prevents most patients with diabetes from
achieving normal blood glucose levels. They can lower their blood glucose
enough to prevent long-term complications such as eye disease, kidney 
disease, and nerve disease, but preventing heart disease requires a lower 
glucose level that is difficult to sustain because of the threat of hypo-
glycemia, particularly for people with type 1 diabetes. A normal blood 
glucose is between 80 and 140 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia begins below 80 mg/dl
but you may not feel symptoms until it goes below 60 mg/dl.
The positive news is that most patients experience complete recovery from
the effects of hypoglycemia.
Symptoms of hypoglycemia
Your body doesn’t function well when you have too little glucose in your
blood. Your brain needs glucose to run the rest of your body, as well as to
function intellectually. Your muscles need the energy that glucose provides in
much the same way that your car needs gasoline. So, when your body detects
that it has low blood glucose, it sends out a group of hormones that rapidly
raise your glucose. But those hormones have to fight the strength of the dia-
betes medication that has been pushing down your glucose levels.
At what level of blood glucose do you develop hypoglycemia? Unfortunately,
the level varies for different individuals, particularly depending on the length
of time that the person has had diabetes. But most experts agree that a blood
glucose of 60 mg/dl (3.3 mmol/L) or less is associated with signs and symp-
toms of hypoglycemia in most people.
55
Chapter 4: Battling Short-Term Complications

Doctors traditionally put the symptoms of hypoglycemia into two major 
categories:
 Symptoms due to the side effects of the hormones (especially epineph-
rine) that your body sends out to counter the glucose-lowering effect
of insulin: This category of symptoms is called adrenergic symptoms,
because epinephrine comes from your adrenal gland.
 Symptoms that are due to your brain not receiving enough fuel so that
your intellectual function suffers: This category of symptoms is called
neuroglycopenic symptoms, which is medicalese for “not enough (penic)
glucose (glyco) in the brain (neuro).” (If your brain could speak, it would
just say, “Whew, I’m ready for a meal!”)
Adrenergic symptoms occur most often when your blood glucose falls
rapidly. The following adrenergic symptoms may tip you off that you’re 
hypoglycemic:
 Whiteness, or pallor, of your skin
 Sweating
 Rapid heartbeat
 Palpitations, or the feeling that your heart is beating too fast
 Anxiety
 Numbness in the lips, fingers or toes
 Irritability
 Sensation of hunger
Neuroglycopenic symptoms occur most often when your hypoglycemia takes
longer to develop. The symptoms become more severe as your blood glucose
drops lower. The following neuroglycopenic symptoms are often signs that
you’re becoming (or already are) hypoglycemic:
 Headache
 Loss of concentration
 Visual disorders, such as double vision or blurred vision
 Fatigue
 Confusion and trouble concentrating
 Trouble hearing
 Poor color vision
56
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

 Feeling of warmth
 Slurred speech
 Convulsions
 Coma, or an inability to be awakened
Intelligent people lose their ability to think clearly when they become hypo-
glycemic. They make simple mistakes, and other people often assume that
they are drunk.
One of my patients was driving on a highway when another driver noticed
that she was weaving back and forth in her lane and reported her to the high-
way patrol. A patrolman stopped her, concluded that she was drunk, and
took her to jail. Fortunately, someone noticed that she was wearing a diabetic
medical bracelet. After promptly receiving the nutrition that she needed, she
rapidly recovered. No charges were filed, but clearly this situation is one that
you want to avoid. Always test your blood glucose level to make sure that it’s
satisfactory before driving your car. Should you be low, a couple of glucose
tablets will solve the problem.
If you take insulin or a sulfonylurea drug, which squeezes more insulin out 
of your reluctant pancreas, for your own safety you need to wear or carry
with you some form of identification, in case you unexpectedly develop 
hypoglycemia. (See Chapter 10 for a full explanation of insulin and the sul-
fonylurea medications.) You can find a simple bracelet at the Medicalert
Foundation at www.medicalert.org. If you prefer something a little sexier
that you will be proud to wear as jewelry, try www.mylifewear.com.
Causes of hypoglycemia
Hypoglycemia results from elevated amounts of insulin driving down your
blood glucose to low levels, but an extra high dose of insulin or sulfonylurea
medication isn’t always the culprit that elevates your insulin level. The
amount of food you take in, the amount of fuel (glucose) that you burn for
energy, the amount of insulin circulating in your body, and your body’s ability
to raise glucose by releasing it from the liver or making it from other body
substances all affect your blood glucose level.
On average, hypoglycemia occurs about 10 percent of the time in people with
type 1 diabetes, but it causes noticeable symptoms only about twice a week
and is severe perhaps once a year. In people with type 2 diabetes, severe
hypoglycemia occurs only one-tenth as often. The medications described in
the next section are part of the reason that people with type 1 diabetes have
to deal with hypoglycemia more often.
57
Chapter 4: Battling Short-Term Complications

Insulin and sulfonylurea medications 
Many people with type 1 diabetes (and some with type 2) rely on insulin
injections or sulfonylurea medications to control the disease. When you take
insulin shots, you have to time your food intake to raise your blood glucose
as the insulin is taking effect. Chapter 10 explains the different kinds of
insulin and the proper methods for administering them. But remember that
the different types of insulin are most potent at differing amounts of time
(minutes or hours) after you inject them. If you skip a meal or take your
insulin too early or too late, your glucose and insulin levels won’t be in sync
and you’ll develop hypoglycemia. If you go on a diet and don’t adjust your
medication, the same thing happens.
If you take sulfonylurea drugs, you need to follow similar restrictions. You
and your doctor must adjust your dosage when your calorie intake falls.
Other drugs don’t cause hypoglycemia by themselves, but when combined
with sulfonylureas they may lower your glucose enough to reach hypo-
glycemic levels. (Chapter 10 talks more about these other drugs.)
Diet
Your diet plays a major role in helping you avoid hypoglycemia if you take
medication. You should try to have a snack in the middle of the morning and
in the afternoon — in addition to your usual breakfast, lunch, and dinner —
especially if you take insulin. A properly timed snack provides you with a
steady source of glucose to balance the insulin that you’re taking. Chapter 8
gives much greater detail about proper diet. 
You can use your blood glucose level to determine whether to have a snack
at bedtime. If your glucose is greater than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L), you proba-
bly don’t need a snack. If your glucose is between 126 and 180 mg/dL (7 to 10
mmol/L), a couple slices of bread and an ounce of cheese will prevent hypo-
glycemia. If your glucose is less than 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L), a couple ounces
of meat plus a slice of bread will do the trick.
Exercise
Exercise burns your body’s fuel, which is glucose, so it generally lowers your
blood glucose level. Some people with diabetes use exercise in place of extra
insulin to get their high blood glucose down to a normal level. But if you
don’t adjust your insulin dose or food intake to match your exercise level,
exercise can result in hypoglycemia.
One of my patients is dedicated to exercise. He has taken insulin shots for
years but requires very little insulin to control his glucose because he burns
so much glucose through exercise. He avoids hypoglycemia by measuring his
blood glucose level many times a day — especially before vigorous exercise.
If his level is low at the beginning of exercise, he eats extra carbohydrates
58
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

before he starts. Chapter 8 tells you which foods to eat (and when) in order
to have the intended effect on your glucose levels.
People who exercise regularly require much less medication and generally
can manage their diabetes more easily than nonexercisers can. Chapter 9
covers much more about the benefits of exercise.
Non-diabetes medications
Several drugs that you may take unrelated to your diabetes can lower your
blood glucose. One of the most widely used, which you may not even think of
as a drug, is alcohol — wine, beer, and other spirits. Alcohol can block your
liver’s ability to release glucose. It also blocks hormones that raise blood glu-
cose and increases the glucose-lowering effect of insulin. If you’re malnour-
ished for some reason or you simply haven’t eaten in a while and you drink
alcohol before going to bed, you may experience severe fasting hypoglycemia
the next morning.
Watch out for these drugs that can lower your blood glucose:
 Alcohol: If you take insulin or sulfonylurea drugs, don’t drink alcohol
without eating some food at the same time. Food counteracts some of
the glucose-lowering effects of alcohol.
 Aspirin: Also, be aware that aspirin (and all of the drugs related to
aspirin, called salicylates) can lead to hypoglycemia. In adults who have
diabetes, aspirin can increase the effects of other drugs that you’re
taking to lower your blood glucose. In children with diabetes, aspirin
has an especially profound effect on lowering blood glucose to hypo-
glycemia levels. However, the low dose of aspirin taken daily to reduce
the risk of heart attacks does not cause hypoglycemia.
Hormonal changes
As type 1 diabetes progresses, your body produces fewer and fewer hor-
mones that counteract insulin when hypoglycemia is present. This situation
leads to more severe hypoglycemia later in type 1 diabetes, especially if you
and your doctor don’t adjust your insulin injections in response to your
lower glucose levels. People with type 2 diabetes who take insulin also
develop this loss of protective hormones.
These same hormones also play the role of giving you warning signs when
your blood glucose drops, such as sweating, a rapid heart beat, and anxiety,
so you are prompted to eat. When the hormone levels drop, these warning
signs don’t occur, so you aren’t signaled that it’s time to eat. This situation is
called hypoglycemia unawareness.

Chapter 4: Battling Short-Term Complications

Prevention of hypoglycemia
People with diabetes can use a number of simple techniques to prevent hypo-
glycemia, including the following:
 Frequently measuring your blood glucose with a glucose meter (see
Chapter 7).
 Maintaining a realistic goal for your blood glucose level. This subject is
one you need to discuss with your doctor.
 Altering the timing of food and exercise (see Chapters 8 and 9).
 Altering your insulin and oral drug regimens (see Chapter 10).
 Becoming totally aware of your own symptoms for low blood glucose.
(See the section “Symptoms of hypoglycemia,” earlier in this chapter.)
Levels of hypoglycemia
There are three levels of severity of hypoglycemia, defined by the level of the
blood glucose:
 Mild hypoglycemia: This level, corresponding to a blood glucose of
around 75 mg/dl, is easily treated by the patient himself. It does not
cause the patient to change his routine and, in fact, is discovered not 
so much by symptoms as by the finding of a low blood glucose during
routine testing of the blood.
 Moderate hypoglycemia: This level is achieved when the blood glucose
is found to be around 65 mg/dl. The patient begins to feel the adrenergic
symptoms described above, especially anxiety and a rapid heartbeat.
Patients who have moderate hypoglycemia may not recognize they need
glucose and have to be helped by someone else.
 Severe hypoglycemia: This level occurs when the blood glucose is less
than 55 mg/dl leaving the patient severely impaired and thus requiring
outside assistance to restore his or her glucose. An emergency injection
of glucagon or intravenous glucose solution is necessary.
Treatment of hypoglycemia
The vast majority of hypoglycemia cases are mild. You can treat hypo-
glycemia with a small quantity of glucose in the form of:
60
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

 Two sugar cubes.
 Two or three glucose tablets (Glucose tablets are available in any drug-
store, and any person with diabetes who may develop hypoglycemia
should carry them.)
 A small amount (six ounces) of a sugary soft drink.
 Eight ounces of milk or four ounces of orange juice. (These drinks work
very well.)
 Anything that has about 15 grams of glucose in it. 
Sometimes you need a second treatment. Approximately 20 minutes after you
try one of these solutions, measure your blood glucose to find out whether
your level has risen sufficiently. If it is still low, give a second treatment.
Keep the following tips in mind to aid in your treatment of hypoglycemia:
 You can easily overtreat hypoglycemia, causing your blood glucose to
rise higher than you’d like. However, the high blood glucose resulting
from overtreatment of hypoglycemia usually does not last long. You’re
better off not using a drug or insulin to bring it down, because doing so
can result in alternate highs and lows.
 Make sure that your friends or relatives know in advance what hypo-
glycemia is and what to do about it because your mental state may be
mildly confused when you have it. Inform people about your diabetes
and about how to recognize hypoglycemia. Don’t keep your diabetes a
secret. The people close to you will be glad to know how to help you.
 Try to eat a snack of carbohydrates and protein every hour if you are
doing prolonged exercise, such as playing a baseball or soccer game
that lasts several hours. (For example, half a turkey sandwich would
work well.) And carry jelly beans at all times, just in case — six or seven
are all you need to combat mild symptoms of hypoglycemia.
If you are losing consciousness so that you can’t sit up and swallow properly
when you have hypoglycemia, no one should try to feed you. One of the fol-
lowing options should be used:
 Someone helping you can use an emergency kit, such as the kit called
“Glucagon for Emergencies.” This kit includes a syringe with 1 mg of
glucagon, one of the major hormones that raises glucose, which your
helper should inject into your muscle. The injection of glucagon raises
your blood glucose so that you regain consciousness within 20 minutes.
Glucagon corrects your hypoglycemic condition for about an hour after
you receive an injection.
61
Chapter 4: Battling Short-Term Complications

You need to get a prescription from your doctor for this type of glucagon
kit. Make sure the kit doesn’t become outdated if you don’t use it for a
long time.
 If your hypoglycemia recurs shortly after you receive glucagon or
doesn’t respond to the glucagon, the person helping you should call
911. (Sulfonylurea drugs are most often the cause of such a severe case
of hypoglycemia.) The emergency crew checks your blood glucose and
gives you an intravenous (IV) dose of high-concentration glucose. Most
likely, you will continue the IV in the emergency room until you show
stable and normal blood glucose levels.
Combating Ketoacidosis
In Chapter 3, I talk about the tendency of people with type 1 diabetes to
suffer from a severe diabetic complication called ketoacidosis, or very high
blood glucose with large amounts of acid in the blood. The following sections
explain the symptoms, causes, and treatments of ketoacidosis.
The prefix keto refers to ketones — substances that your body makes as fat
breaks down during ketoacidosis. Acid is part of the name because your
blood becomes acidic from the presence of ketones.
Can ketoacidosis affect you?
Occasionally, ketoacidosis is the symptom that alerts doctors that you have
type 1 diabetes, but more frequently it occurs after you already know that
you have the disease. Although ketoacidosis occurs mostly in people with
type 1 diabetes (who develop diabetes at an early age), the person is usually
40 or more years old when ketoacidosis actually begins.
Ketoacidosis occurs mostly in people with type 1 diabetes because they have
no insulin in their bodies except what they inject as medication. Those with
type 2 diabetes (or with other forms of the disease) rarely get ketoacidosis
because they have some insulin in their bodies, even though the insulin usu-
ally isn’t fully active due to insulin resistance. People with type 2 diabetes get
ketoacidosis mainly when they have severe infections or traumas that put
their bodies under great physical stress.
62
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Symptoms of ketoacidosis
The symptoms of ketoacidosis regularly alert doctors to type 1 diabetes in
children. But ketoacidosis more often occurs in adults with type 1 diabetes,
so they should also keep an eye out for the following symptoms:
 Nausea and vomiting: You experience these symptoms because of the
buildup of acids and the loss of important body substances.
 Rapid breathing: This condition is also known as Kussmaul breathing,
after the man who first described it. You experience rapid breathing
when your blood is so acidic that your body attempts to blow off some of
the acid through the lungs. Your breath has a fruity smell due to acetone.
 Extreme tiredness and drowsiness: You’re tired because your brain is
bathed in very thick blood, like syrup, and is missing the essential sub-
stances you’ve lost in the urine.
 Weakness: You become weak because your muscle tissue is unable to
get its fuel, namely glucose.
In this age of self-monitoring for blood glucose levels, ketoacidosis is becom-
ing more rare, but it still occurs. (See Chapter 7 for more on self-monitoring.)
If you use a source of insulin that can be interrupted, you could unexpectedly
develop ketoacidosis. For example, if you rely on an insulin pump, which
pushes insulin under your skin automatically (as I describe in Chapter 10),
the pump could stop for some reason; then your insulin delivery would
cease, your glucose level would rise, and ketoacidosis would develop if you
don’t notice the interruption soon enough.
You may notice that you have some symptoms of ketoacidosis and begin to
suspect that you have this complication. But that diagnosis is best made by 
a doctor — preferably in the hospital, where you can begin treatment at
once. Doctors make a diagnosis of ketoacidosis when they see the following
abnormalities:
 High blood glucose, usually more than 300 mg/dl (16.6 mmol/L)
 Acid condition of your blood
 Excessive levels of ketones in your blood and urine
 Dry skin and tongue, indicating dehydration
 Deficiency of potassium in your body
 An acetone smell on your breath
When your doctor finds these abnormalities, he or she will want to begin
treatment immediately.
63
Chapter 4: Battling Short-Term Complications

Causes of ketoacidosis
The two most common causes of ketoacidosis are the interruption of your
insulin treatment and an infection. Your body can’t go for many hours with-
out insulin activity before it begins to burn fat for energy and begins to make
extra glucose that it can’t use. The process of burning fat creates ketones in
your blood, which are responsible for your ketoacidosis. (Refer to the earlier
section “Combating Ketoacidosis.”)
Whether you’re person with diabetes or not, if you go on a strict diet to lose
weight, your body burns some of its fat stores and produces ketones, similar
to how it burns fat when you lack insulin. But in this case, your glucose
remains low and (unless you have type 1 diabetes) you have sufficient insulin
to prevent the excessive production of new glucose or the release of large
amounts of glucose from your liver. So a strict diet doesn’t generally lead to
ketoacidosis but rather a benign condition called ketosis.
Treatment of ketoacidosis
Ketoacidosis is a serious condition that requires professional treatment. But
even though you leave the treatment to a professional rather than trying to
manage it yourself, you should know the treatment processes so that you
understand what’s happening to you or to your loved one.
The basis of ketoacidosis treatment is to restore the proper amount of water
to your body, reduce the acid condition of your blood by getting rid of the
ketones, restore substances such as potassium that you’ve lost, and return
your blood glucose to its normal level of around 80 to 120. All of these
improvements should happen simultaneously after you begin treatment.
The following list gives you a basic understanding of how the treatment
process goes:
 Your doctor sets up a flowchart to keep track of your levels of glucose,
acid, potassium, and ketones, along with other parameters. Although
you’ve lost a lot of potassium, for example, the initial blood reading of
potassium on your flowchart may look normal. As your treatment pro-
gresses, more potassium goes into your cells to replenish losses there,
so your blood potassium may fall. If that happens, the doctor adminis-
ters more potassium to fix the problem.
 Your doctor gives you insulin intravenously to restore your insulin
levels and reverse the abnormalities in your body. Your lack of insulin
got you into this ketoacidosis situation in the first place. At some point,
your blood glucose may fall toward hypoglycemia. If it does, your doctor
gives you another IV made up of glucose and a solution of salt, potas-
sium, and water.
64
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

After you receive insulin, your body stops breaking down fat for energy
because your cells can use glucose for energy as they’re supposed to.
Soon, your body rids itself of the ketones in your bloodstream that caused
your complication, and your body takes on a more normal condition.
 Your doctor gives you large volumes of a saltwater solution intra-
venously to replace the six or more liters of fluids that you lose during
ketoacidosis. Replenishing your body’s fluids relieves the nausea and
vomiting that you’ve endured, and you’re now able to keep down liquid
and solid foods again. 
Hopefully, you notice your normal mental functioning returning, which
means that you’ll soon be ready to resume self-administering your
insulin and controlling your own diet. By this time, the doctor has proba-
bly found and corrected a malfunctioning insulin pump or an infection
that was a factor in causing your ketoacidosis.
Most of the time, your doctor can control ketoacidosis with little or no risk to
you. But be aware that ketoacidosis is fatal for 10 percent of people with dia-
betes who get it — mostly elderly people with diabetes and those with other
illnesses that complicate treatment. Recognizing the symptoms early and
seeking treatment quickly greatly enhance your chances of an uneventful
recovery from ketoacidosis.
Managing the Hyperosmolar Syndrome
The highest blood glucose condition that you may find yourself in is called
the hyperosmolar syndrome. Like ketoacidosis, the hyperosmolar syndrome,
referring to the excessive levels of glucose in the blood, is a medical emer-
gency that needs to be treated in a hospital.
The hyperosmolar syndrome is also like ketoacidosis in its effects on your body.
The hyperosmolar syndrome creates ketones in your blood, but it doesn’t make
your blood as acidic as ketoacidosis does. It also raises your blood glucose
levels considerably higher than ketoacidosis does. (See the “Combating Keto-
acidosis” section earlier in this chapter for more information.)
Hyper means “larger than normal,” and osmolar has to do with concentrations of
substances in the blood. So hyperosmolar, in this situation, means that the
blood is simply too concentrated with glucose. Other hyperosmolar syndromes
occur when other substances are at fault.
The following sections explain hyperosmolar syndrome’s symptoms, causes,
and treatments.
65
Chapter 4: Battling Short-Term Complications

Symptoms of the hyperosmolar syndrome
Because the hyperosmolar syndrome complication is so similar to ketoacido-
sis, it has many of the same symptoms as ketoacidosis. The main difference
is that with hyperosmolar syndrome, you don’t experience the rapid
Kussmaul breathing, because your blood isn’t overly acidic as a part of 
this complication. Also, the symptoms of the hyperosmolar syndrome
develop over many days or weeks, unlike the quick and acute development 
of ketoacidosis in your body.
If you measure your blood glucose on a daily basis, you should never develop
the hyperosmolar syndrome because you’ll notice that your blood glucose is
getting high before it reaches the critical complication level.
The most important signs and symptoms of the hyperosmolar syndrome are
 Frequent urination
 Thirst
 Weakness
 Leg cramps
 Sunken eyeballs and rapid pulse, due to dehydration
 Decreased mental awareness or (if you delay treatment) coma
 Blood glucose of 600 or even higher if you delay seeing a doctor
You may also develop more threatening symptoms with this complication.
Your blood pressure may be low. Your nervous system may be affected with
paralysis of the arms and legs, but these respond to treatment. You may have
high counts of potassium, sodium, and other blood constituents (such as
white blood cells and red blood cells), but these counts usually fall rapidly
and your doctor will replace these elements in your blood as water is
restored to your body.
Causes of the hyperosmolar syndrome
The hyperosmolar syndrome afflicts mostly the elderly with diabetes who
live alone or in nursing homes where they’re not carefully monitored. Age
and usually some neglect combine to increase the likelihood that a person
with diabetes will lose large quantities of fluids through vomiting or diarrhea
and then not replace those fluids. These people tend to have mild type 2 dia-
betes, and sometimes their diabetes is undiagnosed and untreated.
66
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Another reason age is a contributing cause of the hyperosmolar syndrome 
is that your kidneys gradually become less efficient as you age. When your
kidneys are in their prime, your blood glucose level needs to reach only 180
mg/dl before your kidneys begin to remove some excess glucose through
your urine. But as your kidneys grow older and slower, they require a gradu-
ally higher blood glucose level before they start to send excess glucose to
your urine. If you’re at an age (usually 70 or older for people in average
health) when your kidneys are really laboring to remove the excess glucose
from your body and you happen to lose a large amount of fluids from sick-
ness or neglect, your blood volume decreases, which makes it even harder
for your kidneys to remove glucose. At this point, your blood glucose level
begins to skyrocket. If you don’t replace some of the lost fluids quickly, your
glucose rises even higher.
If you allow your blood glucose to rise and don’t get the fluids that you need,
your blood pressure starts to fall and you get weaker and weaker. As the con-
centration of glucose in your blood continues to rise, you become increas-
ingly confused, and your mental state diminishes until you eventually fall into
a coma.
Other factors — such as infection, failure to take your insulin, and taking cer-
tain medications — can raise your blood glucose to the hyperosmolar syn-
drome levels, but not replacing lost body fluids is the most frequent cause.
Treatment of the hyperosmolar syndrome
Even more so than ketoacidosis (see the section “Treatment of ketoacidosis”
earlier in this chapter), the hyperosmolar syndrome requires immediate and
skilled treatment from a doctor. By no means should you try to treat the
hyperosmolar syndrome yourself. In fact, you should avoid doctors who are
not experienced in treatment of this condition. You need the proper treat-
ment from an experienced doctor — and you need it fast. The death rate for
the hyperosmolar syndrome is high because most people who suffer from it
are elderly and often have other serious illnesses that complicate treatment.
When you arrive at your doctor’s office or emergency room with the hyperos-
molar syndrome, your doctor must accomplish the following tasks fairly
rapidly:
 Restore large volumes of water to your body
 Lower your blood glucose level
 Restore other substances that your body has lost, such as potassium,
sodium, chloride, and so on
67
Chapter 4: Battling Short-Term Complications

Your doctor creates a chart to monitor your levels of glucose, blood concen-
tration (osmolarity), potassium, sodium, and other substances, which are
measured hourly in some cases. You may think that you need to receive large
amounts of insulin to lower your high glucose level, but the large doses of
fluids that your doctor gives you do so much to lower your glucose that you
need only smaller doses of insulin. As your body fluids return to normal, your
kidneys begin to receive much more of the blood that they need in order to
rid your body of the excess glucose, and your kidney function improves.

I
f you’re preventing short-term complications (see Chapter 4), you’re also
preventing long-term complications, which I describe in this chapter. So,
you’re preventing two sets of complications with just one treatment. The dif-
ference you need to remember between short-term and long-term complica-
tions is that short-term complications result from the immediate effects of
very high and very low blood glucose levels, and short-term complications
are reversible. On the other hand, long-term complications result from
damage done by high blood glucose levels as well as abnormal fat levels and
abnormal blood pressure. But, unlike short-term complications, after a while,
long-term complications aren’t reversible.
The complications detailed in this chapter are the problems that occur if you
permit your blood glucose to rise and remain high over many years. The
point that I stress throughout this book is that you have a choice. Working
with your doctor and other helpers, you can keep your blood glucose near
normal so that you never have to deal with these long-term complications.
The struggle to live an uncomplicated life with diabetes reminds me of a 
commercial airplane pilot who took the airplane down for a rough landing. 
As was his custom, after the plane landed the pilot stood at the exit; he

waited for passengers to make nasty comments about the landing, but no one
mentioned it. Finally, a little old lady walked to the exit with her cane and
said to the pilot, “Tell me, did we land, or were we shot down?”
The choice is yours: You can have a smooth landing, free of complications,
that goes relatively unnoticed by you and those around you. Or you can have
the feeling that you have been shot down.
How Long-Term Complications Develop
Doctors aren’t sure of the precise reason that long-term complications of 
diabetes develop. They have lots of theories, many of them strongly based 
on findings in animals and human beings. For most long-term complications
except heart disease — such as kidney disease, eye disease, and nerve 
disease — doctors believe that years of high blood glucose levels initiate the
complications. (In the case of heart disease, high blood glucose levels may
make the disease worse or more complicated but not actually cause it.) Most
long-term complications require ten or more years to develop, which seems
like a long time until you consider that many people with type 2 diabetes
have it for five or more years before a doctor diagnoses it.
Often the long-term complication itself (rather than a high blood glucose
level) is the clue that leads a doctor to diagnose diabetes in a patient.
Therefore, doctors need to look for long-term complications immediately
after diagnosing diabetes, because the diabetes and any long-term complica-
tions may have been with the patient for quite some time already. Because of
the possibility of long-term complications being present at the diagnosis of
diabetes, your doctor also must immediately take steps to control your glu-
cose levels.
Kidney Disease
Your kidneys rid your body of many harmful chemicals and other compounds
produced during the process of normal metabolism. Your kidneys act like a
filter through which your blood pours, trapping the waste and sending it out
in your urine, while the normal contents of the blood go back into your
bloodstream. They also regulate the salt and water content of your body.
When kidney disease (also known as nephropathy) causes your kidneys to
fail, you must either use artificial means, called dialysis, to cleanse your
blood and control the salt and water or receive a new working donor kidney,
called a transplant.
70
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

71
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications
How high glucose leads to complications
Although doctors aren’t certain about the
causes of most long-term complications of dia-
betes, I mention the current theories about the
causes of the complications as I explain each
complication in this chapter. All long-term com-
plications share some common characteristics:
 Advanced glycated end products (AGEs)
are one of the substances that damage tis-
sues. AGEs can damage the eyes, the kid-
neys, the nervous system, and other organs
in your body. You always have glucose in
your blood, and some of that glucose
attaches to other substances in your blood-
stream to form glycated (glucose-attached)
products. In this way, hemoglobin, which
carries oxygen through your blood to cells
and tissues throughout your body, attaches
to glucose to form hemoglobin A1c. Albumin,
a protein in blood, forms glycated albumin.
Glucose can attach to red blood cells and
white blood cells, as well as to other cells
and molecules in the bloodstream. When
these normal body substances attach to glu-
cose, they no longer work normally.
When glucose attaches to other sub-
stances and cells, it alters their functions,
usually in a negative fashion. For example,
hemoglobin A1c holds on to oxygen more
strongly than hemoglobin, so the cells that
need oxygen don’t get it as easily. Red blood
cells that are glycated do not last as long in
your blood circulation. Glycated white blood
cells can’t fight infection as well as ungly-
cated white cells can.
Your body handles a certain level of gly-
cated substances. But when your blood glu-
cose is elevated for prolonged periods of
time, the level of glycated cells and sub-
stances becomes excessive, and the com-
plications I describe in this chapter result.
An interesting study in Diabetes Care in
August 2005 showed that AGEs are present
in higher amounts in patients with T2DM
who develop peripheral arterial disease
(see below) compared to those who don’t
develop it. It suggests that AGEs play a role
in large blood vessel disease as well as
small blood vessel disease.
 The Polyol Pathway is another major source
of damage to the body in diabetes. Polyol
Pathway refers to one direction, or path-
way, that glucose can take as it is metabo-
lized (broken down). For example, the
common pathway is to form carbon dioxide
and water as energy is produced. When you
have a lot of glucose in your blood, an abnor-
mal amount is metabolized to become a
product called sorbitol. Sorbitol is a member
of a class of substances called polyols.
Sorbitol accumulates in many tissues where
it can damage them in various ways:
Damage from swelling: Body water enters
the cells to make the concentration of sub-
stances equal outside and inside, because
sorbitol does not pass out of the cell. This
causes damage and destruction of cells.
Damage from chemical reactions: During
the production of sorbitol, other compounds
are produced that chemically damage the
cells and tissues.
Damage from autoantibodies: An article in
August 2005 in Diabetes Care showed that
autoantibodies to autonomic nerves (see
below) are present in patients with diabetes
long before they suffer from autonomic neu-
ropathy involving the heart and the peripheral
autonomic nervous system. Autoimmunity
may be yet another mechanism by which dia-
betes causes long-term complications.

In the United States today, half the patients who require long-term dialysis
require it because of diabetes. Fortunately, this number is on the decline
because of the increasing awareness among people that they need to control
their blood glucose. The incidence of kidney disease is only about 5 percent
among people with type 2 diabetes, compared to 30 percent among people
with type 1 diabetes; however, the absolute number of patients with kidney dis-
ease is about the same for the two groups because type 2 diabetes is so much
more common than type 1. The following sections on kidney complications tell
you how diabetes affects your kidneys, the changes that are occurring in your
body and how you can both check for them while they are still reversible and
prevent them from getting any worse. 
The impact of diabetes on your kidneys
Chronic kidney disease is more prevalent now than it has been in the past.
The major source of all these new cases is diabetes. This section tells you
what you need to know to prevent and manage diabetic kidney disease.
Your kidneys consist of about a million units called nephrons. Each nephron
contains a structure called the glomerulous (the plural is glomeruli) (see
Figure 5-1). Glomeruli cleanse your blood through the following process:
1. Your blood passes through tiny glomerular capillaries. 
2. Your filtered blood travels through tubules connected to the glomeru-
lar capillaries. 
3. As your filtered blood passes through the tubules:
• Your body reabsorbs most of the water and the normal contents of
the blood. 
• A small amount of water and waste passes from the kidney into the
ureter and then into the bladder and out through the urethra.
When you first get diabetes, your kidneys are enlarged and seem to function
abnormally well, judging by how fast they clear wastes from your body. Your
kidneys seem to function so well because you have a large amount of glucose
entering your kidneys, which draws a lot of water with it and causes an increase
in the pressure inside each glomerulous. This more rapid transit of blood
through the kidneys is known as an increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
Early in the development of your diabetes, the membrane surrounding your
glomeruli, called the glomerular basement membrane, thickens, as do other
adjacent structures. These expanding membranes and structures begin to
take up the space occupied by the capillaries inside the glomeruli so that the
capillaries are unable to filter as much blood.
72
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Fortunately, you have many more glomeruli than you really need. In fact, you
can lose a whole kidney and still have plenty of reserve to clean your blood.
If your kidney disease goes undetected for about 15 years, damage may
become so severe that your blood shows measurable signs of the beginning
of kidney failure, called azotemia. If the neglect of the disease reaches 20
years, your kidneys may fail entirely. 
Not every person with diabetes is at equal risk for kidney disease and kidney
failure. This complication seems to be more common in certain families and
among certain racial groups, especially African Americans, Mexican
Americans, and Native Americans. It is certainly more common when high
blood pressure is present. Although we believe that high blood glucose is the
major factor leading to nephropathy, only half of the people whose blood glu-
cose has been poorly controlled go on to develop nephropathy.
Early indications of kidney disease
If your kidneys are on their way to being damaged by diabetic nephropathy
(kidney disease caused by diabetes), doctors can detect microalbuminuria
in your urine. A healthy kidney permits only a tiny amount of albumin, a pro-
tein in the blood, to enter the urine. However, a kidney being damaged by
nephropathy is unable to hold back as much albumin, and the level in the
urine increases, causing microalbuminuria.

Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

Recent evidence suggests, however, that an abnormal amount of albumin in
the urine is not always present when diabetic neuropathy is developing. A
study in Diabetes Care in January 2004 showed that as many as 25 percent of
people with diabetes have kidney disease even though there is no increase in
the albumin in their urine. Blood tests for kidney function show some loss of
function, yet the test for increased albumin is negative. In other words, the
absence of microalbuminuria does not always indicate that no kidney
damage is taking place. Rather, this finding suggests that treatment with
drugs that protect the kidneys should be done for all patients with diabetes,
not just those with microalbuminuria.
For three-quarters of the patients in the early stages of kidney disease, how-
ever, the amount of albumin in your urine is so small that it won’t trigger a
positive result when the traditional urine dipstick test is used. Therefore,
your doctor should perform a more sophisticated test for microalbuminuria
(the presence of tiny but abnormally high amounts of albumin in your urine).
This test can be done by collecting a 24-hour urine specimen (meaning you
save all the urine you produce in 24 hours and have it tested), by taking a
random urine sample, or by collecting a specimen over a certain time period,
usually four hours. If the level of albumin is abnormally high, it needs to be
checked once again to be certain, because some factors (such as exercise)
can trigger a false positive test. A second positive test should lead to action
to protect your kidneys.
Because microalbuminuria can be detected about five years before a urine
dipstick would test positive for albumin, you have time to treat the onset.
Furthermore, treatment during the stage of microalbuminuria can reverse the
kidney disease. After macroalbuminuria is found using the dipstick method,
the disease can be slowed but not stopped.
If you have had type 1 diabetes for five years or more, or if you’ve recently
been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, your doctor must check for microalbumin-
uria unless you’ve already tested positive for albumin with a urine dipstick. If
your test comes back negative, you should have it rechecked annually.
In June 2003 in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers showed 
that microalbuminuria does not always lead to kidney failure. Patients with
type 1 diabetes who improved their blood glucose levels, blood pressure, 
and abnormal blood fats (which I discuss in the next section) experienced a
decline in microalbuminuria and, therefore, a decline in kidney damage. The
levels of improvement indicated by this study are as follows:
 Lowered blood glucose as indicated by a hemoglobin A1c of less than 8
percent (see Chapter 7)
 Lowered blood pressure, with the upper number (the systolic blood pres-
sure) kept under 115 mg mercury
 Cholesterol kept under 198 mg/dl (5.12 mmol/L)
 Triglycerides kept below 145 mg/dl (1.64 mmol/L)

Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Progressive changes
If diabetes is poorly controlled for five years or more, your kidney experi-
ences a significant expansion of the mesangial tissue, the cells between the
capillaries in the kidneys. The amount of microalbuminuria correlates to the
amount of mesangial expansion. Thickening of the glomerular basement
membrane is taking place at the same time but does not correlate as well
with the amount of microalbuminuria.
Over the next 15 to 20 years, the open capillaries and tubules are squeezed
shut by the encroaching tissues; they appear like round nodules (known as
Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules, after the names of their discoverers), and they
are diagnostic of diabetic nephropathy. As the glomeruli are replaced by nod-
ules, less and less filtration of the blood can take place. The blood urea nitro-
gen (a handy blood test that indicates how well the kidneys are working)
begins to rise, ultimately ending in uremia, a condition in which the kidneys
are not doing any cleansing.
Other factors besides high blood glucose contribute to the continuing
destruction of the kidneys. They include the following:
 High blood pressure (hypertension): This factor may be almost as
important as the glucose level. If your blood pressure is controlled by
drugs, the damage to your kidneys slows very significantly. We know
this fact is true because occasionally someone with diabetes suffers
both from high blood pressure and from disease of one of the arteries to
his kidney. The kidney whose artery is diseased doesn’t feel the force of
the high blood pressure. While the other kidney goes on to develop
nephropathy, this kidney is protected and does not develop it.
 Factors of inheritance: Certain families and ethnic groups have a higher
incidence of diabetic nephropathy, as I discuss in the section “The
impact of diabetes on your kidneys,” earlier in this chapter.
 Abnormal blood fats: Research shows that elevated levels of certain
cholesterol-containing fats promote enlargement of the mesangium.
Diabetic nephropathy does not occur alone. If you experience kidney disease,
you need to be aware that the following complications are associated with it:
 Diabetic eye disease: When someone experiences complete failure of
the kidneys, called end stage renal disease, diabetic retinopathy (eye dis-
ease) is always present (see the section “Eye Disease,” later in this chap-
ter). As kidney disease gets worse, retinopathy accelerates. But only half
the people with retinopathy also have nephropathy.
If you test positive for microalbuminuria, you will also have some retinopa-
thy if diabetes is the cause of your kidney problems. If you have diabetes
and have microalbuminuria but retinopathy is not present, your doctor
should look for another cause of kidney disease besides diabetes.
75
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

 Diabetic nerve disease (neuropathy): There is not as great an associa-
tion between nephropathy and neuropathy. Fewer than 50 percent of
patients with nephropathy also experience neuropathy. Neuropathy gets
worse as kidney disease gets worse, but after dialysis has begun, some
of the neuropathy disappears. This situation indicates that part of the
neuropathy may be due to wastes that are retained because of the failing
kidney rather than true damage to the nervous system. (For more on
this condition, see the section “Nerve Disease, or Neuropathy” later in
this chapter.)
 High blood pressure (hypertension): Hypertension plays an important
role in accelerating kidney damage. One-third of patients who have urine
dipstick tests that are positive for albumin also have high blood pressure.
As the blood tests for kidney failure begin to rise, two-thirds of patients
are hypertensive. With end stage renal disease, almost all have high
blood pressure.
 Edema: Edema, or water accumulation, in the feet and legs occurs as the
amount of protein in the urine exceeds one or two grams a day.
Treatment for diabetic nephropathy
If the information in the previous section is making your blood pressure rise,
take a deep breath. I’m happy to report that all the inconvenience and dis-
comfort associated with diabetic nephropathy can be avoided. Following are
a few key treatments that you can do to prevent the disease or significantly
slow it down after it begins:
 Control your blood glucose: This crucial step has been shown to avoid
the onset of nephropathy and to slow it down once it starts. Both the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in the United States,
which studied glucose control in type 1 diabetes, and the United
Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Groups in type 2 diabetes have
proved this point. If you keep your blood glucose close to normal, you
will not develop diabetic nephropathy. (For information on controlling
your blood glucose, see Part III.)
One of the best findings from the DCCT is that even eight years after the
trial ended, participants experienced persistent benefits of reduced blood
pressure and reduced albumin excretion (a marker for kidney damage).
Controlling your blood glucose now will pay off years in the future.
 Control your blood pressure: This step protects the kidneys from rapid
deterioration. Treatment begins with a low-salt diet, but drugs are usu-
ally needed. High blood pressure can be controlled by a variety of drugs,
but one class of drugs seems particularly valuable in nephropathy. This
class is called the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or ACE
inhibitors. (For more on ACE inhibitors, see the sidebar “ACE inhibitors
to the rescue.”) If ACE inhibitors can’t be used for any reason, a similar
76
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

class of drugs called angiotensin II receptor blockers are equally or more
effective.
 Control the blood fats: Because abnormalities of blood fats seem to
make kidney disease worse, you must lower your bad, or LDL, choles-
terol and raise your good, or HDL, cholesterol while lowering the other
fat that is damaging — the triglycerides. A number of excellent drugs, in
a class called statins, can accomplish this task. The ACE inhibitors also
seem to help the levels of fats. (See the sidebar on ACE inhibitors for
more information.)
 Avoid other damage to the kidneys: People with diabetes tend to have
more urinary tract infections, which damage the kidneys. Urinary tract
infections must be looked for and treated. People with diabetes also have
damage to the nerves that control the bladder, producing a neurogenic
bladder. (See the section “Disorders of automatic (autonomic) nerves,”
later in this chapter.) When the nerves that detect a full bladder fail,
proper emptying of the bladder is inhibited, which can lead to infections.
If you have disease in the urinary system, your doctor may want to do
an intravenous pyelogram (IVP), a study to observe the appearance and
function of your kidneys and the rest of your urinary tract. But people
with diabetes with some kidney failure are at high risk for complete fail-
ure of the kidneys as a result of an IVP. Your doctor should use another
type of study that does not put your kidneys at risk.
If these preventative treatments fail, the patient undergoes dialysis or a
kidney transplant.
When the kidneys fail, a main source for the breakdown of insulin is gone,
and the patient requires much less or no insulin, so control of the blood glu-
cose may actually get easier.
 Dialysis: Two dialysis techniques are currently in use.
• Hemodialysis: The patient’s artery is hooked into a tube that runs
through a filtering machine that cleanses the blood and then sends
it back into the patient’s bloodstream. When the patient is moder-
ately well, hemodialysis is done three times a week in a hospital-
like setting. The potential exists for many complications, including
infection and low blood pressure. 
• Peritoneal dialysis: A tube is inserted into the body cavity that
contains the stomach, liver, and intestines, called the peritoneal
cavity. A large quantity of fluid is dripped into the cavity, and it
draws out the wastes, which are then removed as the fluid drains
out of the cavity. Peritoneal dialysis is done at home, often on a
daily basis. Peritoneal dialysis requires the use of sugar in the fluid
so that people with diabetes will have very high blood glucose
levels, which is undesireable, unless insulin is added to the bags of
dialysis fluid. Peritoneal dialysis is also associated with a high rate
of infection where the tube enters the peritoneal cavity.
77
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

Little difference exists in the long-term survival of patients treated with
hemodialysis compared with peritoneal dialysis, so the choice becomes
one of convenience and whether one is covered by insurance more than
the other. People with diabetes do not tolerate kidney failure well, so
dialysis tends to be started earlier in them than in people without dia-
betes.
 Kidney transplant: Patients who receive a kidney transplant seem to do
better than dialysis patients, but in the United States, because of a lack
of kidneys, 80 percent of patients have dialysis and 20 percent have a
transplant. Obviously, a transplanted kidney is foreign to the person
who receives it, and the body tries to reject it. To avoid this result, the
patient is given antirejection drugs, some of which make diabetic control
more complicated. The kidney that is least rejected is the one from a
donor who is most closely related to the patient.
When a healthy kidney enters the body of a person with diabetes, it is
subject to the damage done by elevated glucose levels. After a trans-
plant, controlling your blood glucose is crucial.
78
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 
ACE inhibitors to the rescue
The class of drugs called angiotensin convert-
ing enzyme inhibitors, or ACE inhibitors, has
long been known to lower blood pressure.
Recent studies show that these drugs also
lower the pressure inside the glomeruli (the
structures inside your kidneys that cleanse your
blood). The result is a 50 percent reduction in
death due to diabetic nephropathy and an equal
reduction in the need for dialysis or a kidney
transplant.
Your doctor should prescribe one of these med-
ications if your blood pressure is 140/90 or
higher. The target blood pressure is 120/80 and
even lower in younger people. ACE inhibitors
can even be used if you have microalbuminuria
without hypertension, because the microalbu-
minuria suggests that there is increased pres-
sure within the kidney. When ACE inhibitors are
used, the excretion of albumin begins to fall; if
you are leaking albumin into the urine, your urine
albumin level can be used to monitor the drugs’
effectiveness if your blood pressure is normal.
ACE inhibitors are not perfect: They do cause a
cough in some patients, which some people find
hard to tolerate, but the choice of a particular ACE
inhibitor may solve this problem. In addition, ACE
inhibitors tend to raise the potassium level in the
blood. The potassium level is already an issue
with failing kidneys, so a higher potassium level
may add to the problem. A very high potassium
level can cause abnormalities in the heart.
Angiotensin II receptor blockers can replace ACE
inhibitors when necessary. They’re not associ-
ated with the cough but do raise potassium.
Other drugs used for high blood pressure include
the calcium channel blockers, which may be as
useful as ACE inhibitors. Other antihypertensives
that have been standards in the past for hyper-
tension may cause unacceptable side effects.
Water pills (diuretics such as hydrochloroth-
iazide) raise the blood glucose. Beta blockers like
propranolol make the abnormal fats worse. They
also cause a difficulty in recognizing when the
blood glucose has gone down to very low levels.

Eye Disease
The eyes are the second major organ of the body affected by diabetes over
the long term. Some eye diseases, such as glaucoma and cataracts, also occur
in the nondiabetic population, though they appear at a higher rate and earlier
in people with diabetes. Glaucoma and cataracts respond to treatment very
well. Diabetic retinopathy, however — which I explain in the next section —
is limited to the diabetic population and may lead to blindness. In the past,
blindness was inevitable, but that is not the case today. In the next sections
you will learn about the normal function of the eye and how diabetes can
damage or even eliminate that function. You will also discover the impor-
tance of early diagnosis by regular eye exams and how you can stop the
progress of eye disease should it occur.
Understanding how the eye works
In order to understand how diabetes affects the eyes, Figure 5-2 shows you
the different parts of the eye.
Light enters the eye through the lens where it is bent and focused upon the
retina. The place in the retina where the lens focuses is called the macula.
The retina collects an image and transfers it to the optic nerve, which carries
it to the brain where the image is interpreted. Between the lens and the retina
is a transparent material called the vitreous body. Many more structures exist
within the eye, but they’re not important for my purposes in this chapter.

Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

The eye muscles surround the eye on all sides and are attached to it. These
muscles permit you to look up, down, and sideways without moving your
head. These eye muscles are important in the discussion of diabetic nerve
damage, called neuropathy. (For more on this condition, see the section
“Nerve Disease, or Neuropathy,” later in this chapter.)
Following is a list of common eye diseases found in people with diabetes:
 Cataracts: These opaque areas of the lens can block vision if they’re
large enough. Cataracts tend to be more common in people with dia-
betes, even at a young age, both as a result of advanced glycated end
products (AGEs) that form within the lens, and as a result of the increased
concentration of sorbitol in the lens. (I discuss AGEs and sorbitol in the
sidebar “How high glucose leads to complications,” earlier in this chap-
ter.) Cataracts can be surgically removed by a fairly routine operation.
The entire lens is removed, and an artificial lens is put in its place. With
removal, you have an excellent chance for the restoration of your vision.
 Glaucoma: This high pressure inside the eye is enough to do damage to
the optic nerve. Glaucoma is found more often in people with diabetes
than in the nondiabetic population. If left unchecked, the high pressure
can destroy the optic nerve and destroy your vision. Fortunately, med-
ical treatment can lower the eye pressure and save the eye. Eye doctors
check for glaucoma on a routine basis.
 Retinopathy: Diabetic retinopathy refers to a number of changes that are
seen on the retina of the eye. These changes indicate that the patient
has been exposed to high levels of blood glucose over time. If untreated
at the appropriate time, retinopathy can lead to blindness. The first
changes are seen after ten years of diabetes in both type 1 and 2.
Because retinopathy is much more complicated and less treatable than
the other two conditions, I discuss it in detail in the next section.
If you have diabetes, you must get an annual eye examination by an ophthal-
mologist or optometrist to preserve your vision. This situation is one where
an expert is definitely needed. Doctors who are not ophthalmologists or
optometrists diagnose retinopathy correctly only 50 percent of the time,
while ophthalmologists and optometrists are correct more than 90 percent of
the time. You need to get an eye examination as soon as you are diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes or five years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, and
you need to be rechecked every year after that.
Retinopathy
Ophthalmologists break down retinopathy into two major types, according to
their potential to cause visual loss:
80
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

 Background retinopathy: This type is usually benign but can be a pre-
dictor of worse problems. The first changes noted by the ophthalmolo-
gist are retinal aneurysms, which are the result of weakening of the
capillaries of the eye; they produce outpocketing of the capillaries, which
look like tiny balloons. These aneurysms appear as small red dots on the
back of the eye. They are benign and disappear over time. The weakened
capillaries also rupture sometimes and release blood to form retinal hem-
orrhages and hard exudates. The hard exudates, which are yellowish and
appear round and sharp, are scars from the hemorrhage. If they extend
into the macular area, they reduce vision. If the capillaries in the retina
allow fluid to flow into the macula, you get macular edema, which also
causes loss of vision. These exudates and hemorrhages can last for years.
As the capillaries close, you have a decreased blood supply to the retina,
and cotton wool spots or soft exudates appear. These spots represent
destruction of the nerve fiber layer because of the lack of blood.
These changes usually do not cause complete loss of vision, but in
about 50 percent of cases, they go on to the more serious proliferative
retinopathy.
 Proliferative retinopathy: This condition results in vision loss if
untreated. Just as in many other parts of the body, when the blood
supply in the eye is reduced, new blood vessels form to carry more
blood to the retina. This is the stage of proliferative retinopathy. This
condition is when some visual loss becomes more certain. The growth of
blood vessels takes place into the vitreous body. Hemorrhage into the
vitreous body blocks vision. As the hemorrhage forms a clot and con-
tracts, it may pull up the retina to produce retinal detachment. Because
the lens can no longer focus the light onto the macula, you have a com-
plete loss of vision.
Like diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy has a number of important associations:
 Certain ethnic groups are at very high risk for retinopathy. These
include certain American Indian groups, like the Pima Indians, as well as
Mexican Americans. Researchers aren’t yet certain if African Americans
are at higher risk.
 Specific genetic material, if found in a person with diabetes, increases
the incidence of retinopathy. This material can be found by doing a
chemical analysis of a person’s chromosomes, the material in each cell
that holds the genes. If the genetic material is found, that person has a
higher likelihood of developing retinopathy.
 Males and females get retinopathy equally.
 Greater duration of diabetes results in more eye disease.
 High blood pressure worsens the eye disease.
81
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

 Nephropathy occurs along with the eye disease. (See the “Progressive
changes” section, earlier in this chapter.)
 Smoking and alcohol use probably worsen retinopathy (but the final
word on their influence is not in).
 Patients with severe diabetic retinopathy are at increased risk for heart
attacks. A recent article in Diabetes Care in July 2007 strongly confirmed
this relationship. People with diabetic retinopathy are twice as likely to
have a heart attack as people with diabetes who don’t have retinopathy.
If they have a heart attack they are three times as likely to have a fatal
heart attack.
No drugs are currently available to treat retinopathy, but laser surgery is an
excellent treatment option. And the use of laser surgery to create many burns in
the retina has been shown to save many eyes. Only 5 percent of diabetics with
proliferative retinopathy who undergo laser treatment develop severe visual
loss. Because the retina is being burned, you have some minor loss of vision.
You also have a mild decrease in night vision and a minor decrease in the size of
the field that your eye can take in at one time. The procedure is done outside
the hospital. It is used for treating macular edema with success as well.
Tight control of the blood glucose (maintaining a hemoglobin A1c under 7
percent) is associated with a much better response to laser surgery than
loose control.
Laser surgery cannot treat a retinal detachment that has already occurred.
To do so, a surgical procedure called vitrectomy is used. This operation, done
under general anesthesia, involves removing the vitreous body and replacing
it with a sterile solution. Attachments to the retina are cut, and the retina
returns to its place. Any hemorrhages in the vitreous body are removed at
the same time. Vitrectomy is successful in restoring some vision about 80 to
90 percent of the time. If a retinal detachment is present in addition to hemor-
rhage, the amount of improvement depends upon the extent and duration of
the retinal detachment, with restoration of vision occurring about 50 to 60
percent of the time.
Resources for the blind 
and visually impaired
A search for resources for the blind and visually impaired must begin with
the World Wide Web. Using a search engine, you can come up with more than
8,000 sites that have something to do with loss of vision and blindness. One
of the first sites is the Blindness Resource Center, sponsored by the New York
Institute for Special Education. You can find this site, which contains a huge
list of other sources of information, at www.nyise.org/text/blindness.
htm. The site itself uses large print, so a person with impaired vision can
easily read it.
82
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

The Blindness Resource Center is filled with useful information. Just to give
you the flavor of what is available, here are some of the other sites described
to which you can link from this site:
 A Blind Net (www.blind.net/blindind.htm), which contains useful
information about blindness
 New York Institute For Special Education’s Blindness Resource Center
(www.nyise.org/blind.htm), which provides programs for children
who are blind or visually disabled
 Dialogue magazine (www.blindskills.com), written specifically for
the blind
 Guidedogs for the Blind (www.guidedogs.com), which explains every-
thing you want to know about these amazing animals
Undoubtedly, one of its best links is to the American Foundation for the Blind
(AFB) at www.afb.org/. It would take a good part of a lifetime to read all of
the resource materials that the AFB provides on thousands of pages. The AFB
is the organization that Helen Keller devoted her life to, and it has every
imaginable resource — and some that are unimaginable. Just a few of the
AFB’s reports and fact sheets include
 A profile of the blind and visually impaired audience for television and
video
 A fact sheet on Braille
 Information on synthetic speech systems
 A list of catalog houses that sell specialty products
 Information on accommodating applicants or employees who are blind
or visually impaired
 A bibliography of art for and by the blind
The Web is a tremendous resource for the visually handicapped and should
be utilized by friends, relatives, or the impaired person if that is possible. You
have no reason to feel alone with your visual problem.
Nerve Disease, or Neuropathy
The third major organ system of the body that is attacked by poorly controlled
diabetes is the nervous system. Sixty percent of people with diabetes have
some abnormality of the nervous system. These patients usually don’t realize it
because the disease does not have any early symptoms. These patients usually
have poor glucose control, smoke, and are over age 40. Nerve disease is found
most often in the people who have diabetes the longest. Diabetic neuropathy
often leads to foot infections, foot ulcerations, and amputation — complications
83
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

that are all entirely preventable. (See the section “Diabetic Foot Disease,” later
in this chapter.) The sections that follow describe the basics of nerve disease,
as well as disorders associated with nerve disease.
Basics of neuropathy
How high glucose levels damage nerves remains uncertain. Doctors do know
that the part of the nerve, called the axon, that connects to other nerves or
to muscle becomes degenerated. The damage may be vascular in some cases,
resulting from a cut-off of blood to the nerve, and metabolic in others, result-
ing from chemical toxins produced by the metabolism of too much glucose.
Diabetic neuropathy occurs in any situation where the blood glucose is
abnormally elevated for ten years or more. It is therefore not limited to type 1
or type 2 diabetes, although these are the most common diseases where it is
found. When the elevated blood glucose is brought down to normal, the signs
and symptoms improve. In some cases, the neuropathy disappears.
The fact that intensive control of the blood glucose improves the neuropathy
suggests that the disease is a consequence of abnormal metabolism that
damages the nerves.
The speed with which a nervous impulse travels down a nerve fiber is called
the nerve conduction velocity. In diabetic neuropathy, the nerve conduction
velocity (NCV) is slowed. This slowing may not be accompanied by any
symptoms at first; testing the NCV provides a way of diagnosing neuropathy
in people without symptoms. If a patient who has very mild symptoms takes
medication to control neuropathy, the improvement that follows may be hard
to detect except by doing a nerve conduction velocity study. A medication
that helps the neuropathy would be expected to speed up the NCV.
In addition to a persistently high blood glucose level, neuropathy is made
worse by the following conditions:
 Age: Neuropathy is most common in people over 40.
 Height: Neuropathy is more common in taller individuals, who have
longer nerve fibers to damage.
 Alcohol consumption: Even small quantities of alcohol can make neu-
ropathy worse.
Doctors can test nerve function in a variety of ways because different nerve
fibers seem to be responsible for different kinds of sensation, such as light
touch, vibration, and temperature. The connection between the kind of test
and the fiber it tests for is as follows:
84
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

 Vibration testing: Using a tuning fork, for example, can bring out abnor-
malities of large nerve fibers.
 Temperature testing: Using a warm or cold item, tests for damage to
small fibers, which are very important in diabetes. When small fibers are
damaged, the patient can lose the ability to feel that he is entering a
burning hot bath for instance.
 Light touch testing: Perhaps the most important test that is done, reflects
the large fibers, which sense anything touching our skin. This test is done
using a filament that looks like a hair. The thickness of the filament deter-
mines how much force is needed to bend the filament so that it is felt. For
example, a filament that bends with 1 gram of force can be felt by normal
feet. If a patient can feel a filament that bends with 10 grams of force, it is
unlikely that this person will suffer damage to the foot without feeling it. If
the patient cannot feel any sensation with a filament that requires 75
grams of force to bend, that area is considered to have lost all sensation.
Either you or your doctor can use the 10-gram filament to discover whether
you are at risk for damage to your feet because you cannot feel the pain. This
test takes a minute to do and can save your feet from amputation. (See the
section about the diabetic foot, later in this chapter.)
Disorders of sensation
Disorders of sensation, the most common and bothersome disorders of
nerves in diabetes, occur where the sensory nerves are damaged. Disorders
of sensation include a number of different conditions, which break down into
two categories:
 Diffuse neuropathies: involving many nerves. 
 Focal neuropathies: involving one or several nerves. 
This section focuses on the diffuse neuropathies affecting sensation.
Distal polyneuropathy
Distal polyneuropathy is the most frequent form of diabetic neuropathy.
Distal means far away from the center of the body — in other words, the feet
and hands. Poly means many, and neuropathy is disease in nerves. So this dis-
ease is one of many nerves, which is noticed in the feet and hands. 
Physicians believe that distal polyneuropathy is a metabolic disease (a prob-
lem of too much glucose in the blood, specifically) because patients who have
other diseases with a general abnormality of metabolism, such as kidney fail-
ure or vitamin deficiency, experience a distal polyneuropathy as well.
85
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

The signs and symptoms of distal polyneuropathy are
 Diminished ability to feel light touch (numbness) or feel the position of a
foot, whether bent back or forward, resulting from the loss of the large
fibers
 Diminished ability to feel pain and temperature from loss of small fibers
 Insignificant weakness
 Tingling and burning
 Extreme sensitivity to touch
 Loss of balance or coordination
 Worsening of symptoms at night
The danger of this kind of neuropathy is that the patient doesn’t know, with-
out looking, whether he has trauma to his feet, such as a burn or stepping on
a tack. When the small fibers are lost, the symptoms are uncomfortable but
not as serious. The patient may feel pain when the bed covers are on his feet
or other uncomfortable sensations. The majority of patients with this condi-
tion are unaware of the loss of nerve fibers, and the disease is detected by
nerve conduction studies.
The complications of this loss of sensation are preventable. If you cannot feel
your feet, you must look at them. In the section on feet, later in this chapter, I
offer specific techniques to preserve your feet when neuropathy is present.
The most serious complication of loss of sensation in the feet is the neuro-
pathic foot ulcer. A person with normal nerve function feels pains when 
pressure mounts on an area of the foot. However, a person with diabetic neu-
ropathy doesn’t feel this pressure. A callus forms and, with continued pres-
sure, the callus softens and liquifies, finally falling off to leave an ulcer. This
ulcer becomes infected. If it isn’t promptly treated, it spreads, and amputa-
tion may be the only way of saving the patient. In this situation, loss of blood
supply to the feet is not an important contributing factor to the ulceration —
in fact, the blood supply may be very good.
A less common complication in distal polyneuropathy is neuroarthropathy, or
Charcot’s Joint. In this condition, trauma, which isn’t felt, occurs to the joints
of the foot or ankle. The bones in the foot get out of line, and many painless
fractures may occur. The patient has redness and painless swelling of the foot
and ankle. The foot becomes unusable and is described as a bag of bones.
Treatment of distal polyneuropathy starts with the best glucose control pos-
sible and extremely good foot care. Your doctor should look at your feet
during each visit, particularly if you have any evidence of loss of feeling.
86
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Some drugs, such as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents ibuprofen and
salindac, can reduce the inflammation. Other drugs, such as the antidepressants
amitriptylene or imipramine, reduce the pain and other discomfort. A drug
called capsacin, which is applied to the skin, reduces pain as well. The results
of these treatments are variable and seem to work about 60 percent of the
time. However, the longer the pain has been present and the worse the pain,
the less likely that these drugs will work. 
Another drug, called gabapentin, has been found to work more often than
many of the older drugs, but it causes dizziness and sleepiness, which may
make treatment more complicated.
A promising study in Diabetes Care in October 2002 describes the use of a
spray of isosorbide dinitrate for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.
This spray was effective in half of the patients treated. Another large trial,
this time using alpha lipoic acid, which has to be injected into a vein, was
very successful in improving pain and other symptoms. The trial results were
reported in Diabetes Care in March 2003. 
An even newer and apparently successful therapy is called Anodyne Therapy.
It involves the placement of pads that emit an infrared light that increases cir-
culation under the pad. In a study reported in Diabetes Care in January 2004,
18 patients were treated with four pads placed one on top and bottom of the
foot and one on each side of the calf above the ankle. One foot received the
treatment while the other received “sham” treatment. This therapy was done
for 40 minutes three times a week for 2 weeks. The treatment improved sen-
sation in the feet, improved balance and reduced pain in the treated foot com-
pared to the untreated foot. Those patients who had the greatest impairment
did not improve, however.
Polyradiculopathy-diabetic amyotrophy
Polyradiculopathy-diabetic amyotrophy is a mixture of pain and loss of muscle
strength in the muscles of the upper leg so that the patient cannot straighten
the knee. Pain extends down from the hip to the thigh. This nerve condition
is second in occurrence after distal polyneuropathy in the diabetic popula-
tion. Polyradiculopathy-diabetic amyotrophy generally has a short course
but may continue for years and doesn’t particularly improve with better dia-
betic control. Patients often improve just after the passage of time.
Radiculopathy-nerve root involvement
Sometimes a severe pain in a particular distribution suggests that the root of
the nerve, as it leaves the spinal column, is damaged. The clinical picture is pain
distributed in a horizontal line around one side of the chest or abdomen. The
pain can be so severe that it is mistaken for an internal abdominal emergency.
87
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

Fortunately, the pain goes away after a variable period of time — anywhere
from 6 to 24 months. In the meantime, good glucose control and pain manage-
ment are helpful.
Disorders of movement (mononeuropathy)
Neuropathy can affect nerves to various muscles. Disorders of movement
occur when you lose motor nerves that carry the impulses to muscles to make
those muscles move. When you lose those nerves, you lose the ability to move
or use those muscles. These disorders are believed to originate as a result of
the sudden closing of a blood vessel supplying the nerve. The clinical picture
depends on which nerve or nerves are affected. If one of the nerves to the eye-
ball is damaged, the patient cannot turn his eye to the side that nerve is on. If
the nerve to the face is affected, the eyelid may droop or the smile on one side
of the face may be flat. The patient can have trouble with vision or problems
with hearing. Focusing the eye may not be possible. No treatment really exists,
but fortunately the disorder goes away on its own after several months.
Disorders of automatic 
(autonomic) nerves
Even as you’re reading this page, many movements of muscles are going on
inside your body, but you’re unaware of them. Your heart muscle is squeez-
ing down and relaxing. Your diaphragm is rising up to empty the lungs of air
and relaxing to draw air in. Your esophagus is carrying food from the mouth
to the stomach and, in turn, the stomach pushes it into the small intestine,
which pushes it into the large intestine. All these muscle functions are under
the control of nerves from the brain, and diabetic neuropathy can affect all of
them. These automatic functions are called the autonomic nerves. Sensitive
tests determine that as many as 40 percent of people with diabetes have
some form of autonomic neuropathy. 
The clinical presentation of this type of neuropathy depends upon the
involved nerve. Some possibilities include
 Bladder abnormalities, starting with a loss of the sensation of bladder
fullness: The urine is not eliminated, and urinary tract infections result.
After a while, loss of bladder contraction occurs, and the patient has to
strain to urinate or loses urine by dribbling. The doctor can easily diag-
nose this abnormality by finding out how much urine is left in the blad-
der after urinating. The treatment is to remember to urinate every four
hours or take a drug that increases the force of bladder contraction.
 Sexual dysfunction, which occurs in 50 percent of males with diabetes
and 30 percent of females with diabetes: Males cannot sustain an 
88
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

erection, and females have trouble lubricating the vagina for intercourse.
(See Chapter 6 for more information on these problems.)
 Intestinal abnormalities of various kinds: The most common abnormal-
ity is constipation. In one quarter of all patients with diabetes, nerves to
the stomach are involved, so the stomach does not empty on time. This
condition is called gastroparesis. It can lead to what’s called brittle dia-
betes, where the insulin is active when there is no food. Fortunately, a
drug called metocloprimide helps to empty the stomach. A new treat-
ment that has worked well is the implantation of a device that stimulates
the stomach electrically. It greatly diminishes the symptoms. This treat-
ment was described in a report in Diabetes Care from the University of
Kansas Medical Center in May 2004.
 Involvement of the gallbladder, which leads to gallstones: Normally,
the gallbladder empties each time you eat, especially if you eat a fatty
meal, because the substances in the bile (within the gallbladder) help to
break down fat. If disease of the nerve to the gallbladder prevents it
from emptying, these same substances will form stones.
 Involvement of the large intestine that can result in diabetic diarrhea
with as many as ten or more bowel movements in a day: Accidental
loss of bowel contents can occur, and bacteria can grow abnormally in
the intestine. This problem responds to antibiotic treatment. Diarrhea is
treated with one of several drugs that quiet the large intestine.
 Heart abnormalities: If loss of nerves to the heart occurs, the heart may
not respond to exercise by speeding up as it should. The force of the
heart may not increase when the patient stands, and the patient then
becomes lightheaded. A fast fixed heart rate also may occur, and the
rhythm of the heart may not be normal. Such patients are at risk for
sudden death.
 Sweating problems, especially in the feet: The body may try to com-
pensate for the lack of sweating in the feet by sweating excessively on
the face or trunk. Heavy sweating can occur when certain foods, such as
cheese, are eaten.
 Abnormalities of the pupil of the eye: The pupil determines the amount
of light that is let in. As a result of the neuropathy, the pupil is small and
does not open up in a dark room.
Entrapment neuropathies
These neuropathies result from squeezing of individual nerves as they pass
through bony or ligamentous areas that do not allow expansion so the nerve
is trapped if there is swelling for any reason. The entrapment neuropathies
can produce symptoms similar to the mononeuropathies described above
but they differ in several ways:
89
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

 Onset of mononeuropathies is sudden while entrapment neuropathies
have a gradual onset.
 Mononeuropathies are self-limited, usually resolving over six weeks while
entrapment neuropathies persist unless the nerve is released by surgery.
 Mononeuropathies are painful from the start while entrapment neu-
ropathies gradually get more and more painful.
Entrapment neuropathies are very common in people with diabetes, occur-
ring in one in every three patients.
The entrapment neuropathies include
 Carpal tunnel syndrome: produces reduced sensation in the fingers and
weakness touching the thumb to the fifth finger. The median nerve is
trapped at the wrist.
 Ulnar entrapment: produces reduced sensation in part of the fourth
finger and the entire fifth finger as well as the hand between the fifth
finger and the wrist. The ulnar nerve is trapped at the elbow.
 Radial nerve entrapment: produces loss of sensation in the back of the
hand and “wrist drop” from weakness of the muscles that straighten up
the wrist. The radial nerve is trapped at the elbow.
 Common peroneal entrapment: produces loss of sensation in the side
of the leg and top of the foot and “drop foot” from weakness of the mus-
cles that pull up the foot. The common peroneal nerve is trapped as it
passes the head of the fibula, one of the two bones that begin at the
knee joint and end at the ankle.
 Tarsal tunnel syndrome: produces loss of sensation on both sides of
the foot and wasting of the muscles of the foot resulting in decreased toe
movement. It is like the carpal tunnel syndrome in the foot and results
from trapping of the tibial nerve between two of the small foot bones.
 Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment: produces loss of sensa-
tion on the outside of the thigh but no muscle weakness. It results from
trapping of that nerve at the groin.
The entrapment neuropathies respond to rest, splints, drugs that promote
water loss, injections of steroids and surgery if necessary. The important
thing is not to confuse them with mononeuropathies.
You can see that you can run into all kinds of problems if you develop dia-
betic neuropathy. None of them need ever bother you, though, if you follow
the recommendations in Part III — the closest you will ever get to a nerve
problem will be when you try to get a date with that cute neighbor.

Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Heart Disease
In the last three decades, the number of deaths due to heart disease has fallen
dramatically, thanks to all kinds of new treatments as well as improved diets.
However, the tremendous increase in the number of type 2 diabetes patients
predicted for the next few decades may reverse this trend. In this section, you
find out about the special problems that diabetes brings to the heart.
Risks of heart disease to diabetic patients
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the term for the progressive closure of the
arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. When one or more of your
arteries closes completely, the result is a heart attack (or myocardial infarc-
tion). In diabetes, the incidence of CAD is increased even in the young type 1
patient. The duration of time with diabetes promotes CAD in type 1 patients.
CAD affects males and females with type 1 diabetes in the same way.
Type 2 diabetes is different. CAD is the most common reason for death in type
2 patients. Women with type 2 are at increased risk for CAD compared to men.
Many risk factors promote CAD in the type 2 patient, including the following:
 Increased production of insulin because of insulin resistance
 Obesity
 Central adiposity, which refers to the distribution of fat particularly in
the waist area
 Hypertension (high blood pressure)
 Abnormal blood fats, especially reduced HDL (good cholesterol) and
increased triglyceride. The abnormal fats may persist even when the
patient’s glucose is controlled. People without diabetes but with
impaired glucose tolerance may show the same abnormalities.
People with diabetes have more CAD than people without diabetes. When X-
ray studies of the heart blood vessels are compared, people with diabetes
have more arteries involved than people without diabetes.
If a heart attack occurs, the risk of death is much greater for the person with
diabetes. More than half of all people with diabetes die of heart attacks. If
people without diabetes have heart attacks, they die 15 percent of the time,
but people with diabetes die 40 percent of the time. The death rate is worse
for the person with diabetes who was in poor glucose control before the
heart attack. That same poorly controlled person has more complications,
such as shock and heart failure, from a heart attack than the person without
diabetes. After a heart attack occurs, the outlook is much worse for the person
91
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

with diabetes. A second heart attack occurs in 50 percent of people with dia-
betes (as opposed to 25 percent of people without diabetes), and the death
rate in five years is 80 percent (versus 25 percent for people without diabetes).
The picture is not a pretty one for the person with diabetes who has coro-
nary artery disease. The treatment options are the same for people with and
without diabetes. Therapy to dissolve the clot of blood that is obstructing
the coronary artery can be used, but people with diabetes do not do as well
with angioplasty, the technique by which a tube is placed into the artery to
clean it out and open it up. New techniques using certain chemicals in the tube
are making this better therapy. People with diabetes do as well with surgery to
bypass the obstruction (called bypass surgery) as people without diabetes, but
the long-term prognosis for keeping the graft open is not as good.
Metabolic syndrome
The earliest abnormality in type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, which is
found in people even before diabetes can be diagnosed. People with impaired
glucose tolerance, and even 25 percent of the population with normal glucose
tolerance, have evidence of insulin resistance. The condition, formerly known
as the insulin resistance syndrome, is now called the metabolic syndrome. It is
particularly worrisome because it is being found in obese children and ado-
lescents, resulting in greater danger of diabetes and an early heart attack in
these children. The next twenty years will show us how these risks play out.
Several features accompany insulin resistance, which is associated with three
times the incidence of coronary artery disease compared to people with
normal insulin sensitivity:
 Hypertension: High blood pressure may be a consequence of the
increased insulin required to keep the glucose normal when a patient is
insulin resistant. When people are given insulin to control the glucose, a
rise in blood pressure often occurs.
 Abnormalities of blood fats: The level of triglycerides is elevated, as is
the amount of small, dense LDL (low density lipoprotein), a particle in
the blood that carries bad cholesterol. At the same time, you see a
decline in the amount of HDL (high density lipoprotein), the good cho-
lesterol particle that helps to clean out the arteries.
 Microalbuminuria: The presence of microalbuminuria strongly corre-
lates with the development of coronary artery disease. (See the section
“Early indications of kidney disease,” earlier in the chapter.)
 C-reactive protein: This marker for inflammation in the body (easily
obtained by a blood test) rises as the severity of the metabolic syndrome
increases. It indicates that inflammation plays an important role in coro-
nary artery disease. The important role of inflammation is confirmed by
the presence of inflammatory factors in the blood that come from fat
92
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

tissue and that increase production of fats while they block glucose
metabolism, as well as the presence of inflammatory cells that promote
atherosclerosis in the arteries.
 Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1: This chemical, which
blocks the activity of plasminogen activator, prevents the breakdown of
blood clots that form in the arteries of the heart and other areas.
 Increased abdominal visceral fat: You can lose a lot of this fat, which is
found at the waistline, by dieting and losing 5 to 10 percent of your body
weight.
 Obesity: Many people with the metabolic syndrome are obese, but not all.
Likewise, many people who are obese do not have the metabolic syndrome.
 Sedentary lifestyle: This feature is also often found, but an active
lifestyle does not preclude the metabolic syndrome.
The preceding features, plus some others that I do not list, are found in
people who have an increased tendency to have coronary artery disease and
heart attacks. Keep in mind that the metabolic syndrome may be present
even when diabetes is not. The metabolic syndrome is probably a primary
abnormality and not a consequence of an elevated blood glucose over time.
When insulin resistance is present in diabetes, lowering the blood glucose
may decrease the complications of a heart attack, which are related to high
blood glucose. But lowering blood glucose does not impact the increased ten-
dency to have a heart attack in the first place, which is not dependent on a
high blood glucose.
A number of treatments are available for the metabolic syndrome. If you are
obese and have a sedentary lifestyle, you should correct these problems.
Even a small amount of weight loss or exercise can make a major contribu-
tion toward decreasing the risk of a heart attack.
You can treat elevated triglyceride and reduced HDL with drugs such as the
class called statins. The thiazolidendione drugs (glitazones) — a new class of
drugs of which rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are the only ones currently
available (see Chapter 10) — directly attack the insulin resistance. However, I
no longer recommend rosiglitazone (see Chapter 10) People with diabetes, as
well as people without diabetes but with the features of the metabolic syn-
drome, may find these drugs useful.
There are some new and interesting features of the metabolic syndrome that
remain to be clarified:
 Men with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone, a chemical that con-
trols the calcium in the blood are at higher risk of developing metabolic
syndrome.
 Women with reduced intake of magnesium have a higher incidence of
metabolic syndrome.
93
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

 Abdominal obesity, the presence of visceral fat (see above) is a stronger
predictor of insulin resistance than physical fitness in older men and
women.
 Bariatric surgery to produce a small stomach and divert food lower
down the small intestine reverses all the major components of metabolic
syndrome.
 Low blood levels of the male hormone testosterone predict the occur-
rence of metabolic syndrome and diabetes in middle-aged men.
 The DASH diet, the dietary approach to stop hypertension, improves the
metabolic abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome in both men and
women. See my book, High Blood Pressure For Dummies (Wiley). 
Cardiac autonomic neuropathy
I discuss cardiac autonomic neuropathy briefly in the section on neuropathy,
earlier in this chapter. Basically, the heart is under the control of nerves, and
high glucose levels can damage these nerves. Your doctor can test for this
condition in a number of ways:
 Measure the resting heart rate: It may be abnormally high (greater 
than 100).
 Measure the standing blood pressure: It may fall abnormally low (a
decrease of 20 mm sustained for 3 minutes) compared to the sitting
blood pressure.
 Measure the variation in heart rate when the patient breathes in com-
pared to breathing out: The variation may be abnormally low (under 10).
The presence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy results in a diminished sur-
vival even among patients who don’t have coronary artery disease.
Cardiomyopathy
Cardiomyopathy refers to an enlarged heart and scarring of the heart muscle
in the absence of coronary artery disease. As a result, the heart does not pump
enough blood with each stroke. The patient may be able to compensate by a
more rapid heart rate, but if hypertension is present, a stable condition can
deteriorate.
The key treatment in this condition is control of the blood pressure as well as
control of the blood glucose. Studies in animals in which diabetic cardiomyopa-
thy has been induced have shown healing by controlling the blood glucose.
94
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Diabetic Blood Vessel Disease 
Away from the Heart
The same processes that affect the coronary arteries can affect the arteries
to the brain, producing cerebrovascular disease, and the arteries to the rest
of the body, producing peripheral vascular disease. I explain each condition
in the following sections.
Peripheral vascular disease
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) occurs much earlier in the person with dia-
betes than in the person without diabetes and proceeds more rapidly. This
clogging of the arteries to parts of your body other than the heart and brain
results in the loss of pulses in the feet; after ten years of diabetes, a third of
men and women no longer feel a pulse in their feet. The most common symp-
tom of PVD is intermittent pain in the calves, thighs, or buttocks that begins
after some walking and subsides with rest. People with PVD have a reduction
in life expectancy. When PVD occurs, just as when CAD occurs, it is much
worse in people with diabetes because more of their arteries are involved.
The major screening test for peripheral vascular disease is the anklebrachial
index (ABI). The systolic blood pressure in the ankle is divided by the sys-
tolic blood pressure in the arm. A result of .95 or greater is normal. A result of
less than .75 suggests serious peripheral vascular disease. Some people with
diabetes have a lot of calcium in their arteries and get a higher blood pres-
sure in the ankle than the arm. If the ABI is more than 1 and the systolic
blood pressure in the ankle is more than 300 mm mercury or 75 greater than
the arm, this condition also suggests PVD.
An ABI in a person with diabetes that is less than .9 is associated with a much
higher risk of death from a heart attack according to a study published in
Diabetes Care in March 2006.
In addition to diabetes, certain risk factors increase the severity of PVD. The
following risk factors are unavoidable:
 Genetic factors: PVD is more common in some families and certain
ethnic groups, especially African Americans.
 Age: The risk of PVD increases as you age.
The following risk factors are within your control:
 Smoking, which clearly promotes early foot amputation
 Hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol)
95
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

 High glucose
 Hypertension
 Obesity
In addition to controlling the preceding factors as much as possible, you may
need to take drugs that help prevent closure of the arteries and loss of blood
supply. Aspirin, which inhibits clotting, is among the most useful. Trental
improves the circulation of cells in the blood. In addition, exercise improves
blood flow and promotes the development of blood vessels around an
obstruction. If none of these measures reverses the symptoms, some form of
surgery that opens or bypasses the blocked arteries may be necessary.
Cerebrovascular disease
Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is a disease of the arteries that supply the brain
with oxygen and nutrients. What I say about peripheral vascular disease in the
preceding section also covers cerebrovascular disease, with some exceptions.
The risk factors and the approach to treatment are similar. However, the symp-
toms are very different because the clogged arteries in CVD supply the brain.
If a temporary reduction in blood supply to the brain occurs, the person suf-
fers from a transient ischemic attack, or TIA. This temporary loss of brain
function may present itself as slurring of speech, weakness on one side of the
body, or numbness. TIA may disappear after a few minutes, but it comes back
again some hours to days later. If a major artery to the brain completely
closes, the person suffers a stroke. Fortunately, stroke victims who are seen
soon enough after the stroke can take advantage of clot-dissolving materials.
96
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 
Smoking and diabetes
As we all know, smoking has a number of ill
effects on people without diabetes, but the
effects are even worse in people with diabetes.
Among other things, smoking:
 Reduces blood flow in arteries and blocks
increased flow when it is needed
 Increases pain in the legs in people with
peripheral vascular disease and in the heart
in people with coronary artery disease
 Increases atheromatous plaques,
the
changes in arteries in the heart and other
areas (like the brain and the legs) that pre-
cede closing of the blood vessels
 Increases clustering of platelets, the blood
elements that form a plug or clot that blocks
the artery
 Increases blood pressure, which also wors-
ens atheromatous plaques
These problems don’t even take into account
the effects of smoking on the lungs, the bladder,
and the rest of the body.

People with diabetes are at increased risk for CVD just as they are for PVD.
Their disease tends to be worse than the disease in a person without dia-
betes, and they can have blockage in many small blood vessels in the brain
that leads to the loss of intellectual function, a symptom similar to
Alzheimer’s disease.
The treatable risk factors for CVD are the same as those for PVD (see the pre-
ceding section). You should make attempts to improve them, particularly the
high blood pressure.
Diabetic Foot Disease
If I ever have an opportunity to save people from the consequences of dia-
betes, it’s in this section of the book. About 70,000 amputations occur in the
United States each year, and more than half of them are done on people with
diabetes. Despite the wonderful surgery to bring more blood into the feet, the
number of amputations is actually rising. 
Good medical care can prevent amputations. Your doctor should look at your
feet as routinely as he or she measures your weight.
In the section on neuropathy, earlier in this chapter, I point out that a fila-
ment that requires a pressure of 10 grams to be felt can differentiate the
patient who will not suffer damage to the feet under normal walking condi-
tions from the patient who will. All doctors who have patients with diabetes
should have this filament to test the feet at least annually. Even better, you
should have your own filament and test yourself any time you feel like it. If
you can’t feel the filament, you had better start looking at your feet every
day. See Chapter 7 for where to obtain a filament.
If your feet are dry, you may have loss of sweating. Loss of sweating is usually
accompanied by the loss of touch sensation and the development of ulcers.
You need to moisturize your feet, first by soaking them in water (which you
test with your hand for its temperature), and then by drying them with a
towel and applying a moisturizer.
Ulcers of the foot can develop in a number of ways:
 Constant pressure
 Sudden higher pressure
 Constantly repeated moderate pressure
It takes very little pressure, if constantly applied, to damage the skin. If you
have diminished sensation, some of the following tips may save your feet:
97
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

 Change your shoes about every five hours.
 If you have new shoes, change them every two hours at first. Your shoes
should not be too tight or too loose.
 Never walk barefoot.
 Shake out your shoes before you put them on.
 Inspect your feet daily, with a mirror if necessary.
 Do not use a heating pad on your feet.
 Stop smoking. If you smoke, you are asking for an amputation.
If you do develop an ulcer, the treatment is to take pressure off the site by
resting the foot and elevating it. When the infection is localized in a foot with
adequate blood supply, a plaster cast is applied to overcome the natural ten-
dency to want to stand or walk. The cast protects the ulcer from slight
trauma that could prevent healing.
There is a product that has been shown to speed the healing of deep diabetic
foot ulcers when it is combined with good wound care. (Good wound care
means carefully removing dead tissue and keeping your weight off the ulcer,
along with treating any infection and controlling your blood glucose.) The
product, called Regranex Gel, is distributed by Ortho-McNeil and is applied to
a clean wound bed once daily. You should see significant reduction in the size
of the ulcer within 10 weeks and complete healing by 20 weeks. The long
duration for healing is a problem, because Regranex Gel is very expensive.
However, a typical deep diabetic ulcer is very expensive to treat in any case,
and if this product can speed up your healing, it may be worthwhile.
I must reiterate that ulcers of the foot, which can lead to amputation in
people with diabetes, are entirely preventable. If your feet lack sensation,
your doctor must examine them at every visit, and you must examine them
daily. At the first sign of a problem, take appropriate action.
Skin Disease in Diabetes
Many conditions involving the skin are unique to the person with diabetes
because of the treatment and complications of the disease. The most
common and important complications include the following:
 Bruises occur due to the cutting of blood vessels by the insulin needle.
 Vitiligo (loss of skin pigmentation) is part of the autoimmune aspect of
type 1 diabetes and cannot be prevented.
98
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

 Necrobiosis lipoidica, which also affects people without diabetes, 
creates patches of reddish-brown skin on the shins or ankles, and the
skin becomes thin and can ulcerate. Females tend to have this condition
more often than males. Steroid injections are used to treat this condi-
tion, and the areas eventually become depressed and brown.
 Xanthelasma, which are small yellow flat areas called plaques on the eye-
lids, occur even when cholesterol is not elevated.
 Alopecia, or loss of hair, occurs in type 1 diabetes, but the cause is
unknown.
 Insulin hypertrophy is the accumulation of fatty tissue where insulin is
injected. This condition is prevented by moving the injection site
around.
 Insulin lipoatrophy is the loss of fat where the insulin is injected.
Although the cause is unknown, this condition is rarely seen now that
human insulin has replaced beef and pork insulin (see Chapter 10).
 Dry skin is a consequence of diabetic neuropathy, which leads to a lack
of sweating.
 Fungal infections occur under the nails or between the toes. Fungus likes
moisture and elevated glucose. Lowering your glucose and keeping your
toes dry prevents these infections. Medications may cure this problem,
but it recurs if glucose and moisture are not managed.
 Acanthosis nigricans, a velvety-feeling increase in pigmentation on the
back of the neck and the armpits, causes no problems and needs no
treatment. This condition is usually found when insulin resistance
exists. It is seen in children with type 2 diabetes.
 Diabetic thick skin, which is thicker than normal skin, occurs in people
who have had diabetes for more than ten years.
Gum Disease in Diabetes 
The major problem that people with diabetes may have in their mouths is
gum disease. This problem develops because the higher concentration of glu-
cose in the mouth promotes the growth of germs, which mix with food and
saliva to form plaque on your gums. If you do not brush your teeth twice a
day and floss your teeth once a day, the plaque may harden into tarter, which
is very hard for you to remove. The gums may become brittle and bleed easily,
and then you have gingivitis. You may experience pain and bad breath, and
eventually the gums may become so weakened that they cannot support your
teeth.
99
Chapter 5: Preventing Long-Term Complications

Controlling your blood glucose is a key step in preventing gum disease.
Visiting your dentist for routine cleanings of your teeth twice a year is another
important way to keep your gums healthy. Interestingly, people with diabetes
do not seem to develop cavities more often than people who do not have 
the disease.

othing is quite so pleasant as walking into the hospital room of a
mother with diabetes holding her healthy newborn. Pregnancy associ-
ated with diabetes used to be a disaster for both the baby and the mother. No
longer. With the proper precautions, the diabetic pregnancy can proceed like
a pregnancy without diabetes. This chapter describes everything you need to
know from start to finish, including overcoming obstacles to intercourse,
enjoying a healthy pregnancy, and delivering a healthy baby.
Examining Erection Problems
If carefully questioned, up to 50 percent of all males with diabetes admit to
having difficulty with sexual function. This difficulty usually takes the form of
erectile dysfunction (ED), the inability to have or sustain an erection sufficient
for intercourse. It develops 10 to 15 years earlier in men with diabetes than in
men without diabetes. After the age of 70 more than 95 percent of men with
diabetes have erectile dysfunction. Many factors besides diabetes can cause
the same problem, and you should rule them out before blaming diabetes.
After you eliminate the following possibilities for erectile dysfunction, you
can feel confident that diabetes is the source of the problem:
 Trauma to the penis
 Medications, such as certain antihypertensives and antidepressants

 Hormonal abnormalities, such as insufficient production of the male hor-
mone testosterone or overproduction of a hormone from the brain
called prolactin. Although prolactin is the hormone in women that
causes breast enlargement in pregnancy and later production of milk, its
role in men is not clear.
 Poor blood supply to the penis due to blockage of the artery by periph-
eral vascular disease (see Chapter 5), which can be treated very effec-
tively by microvascular surgery.
 Psychogenic impotence, an inability to have an erection for psychological
rather than physical reasons. This would be managed by a therapist,
especially a sex therapist rather than drugs.
In order to understand how diabetes affects an erection, you need to first
understand how an erection is normally produced.
The erection process
As a result of some form of stimulation — such as touch, sight, or sound —
the brain activates nerves in the parasympathetic nervous system, which is
part of the autonomic nervous system. These nerves cause muscles to relax
so that blood flow into the penis greatly increases. As blood flow increases,
the veins through which blood leaves the penis compress, and the penis
becomes erect. An erect penis contains about 11 times as much blood as a
flaccid penis. With sufficient stimulation, muscles contract, propelling semen
through the urethra (the tube in the penis that normally carries urine from
the bladder) to the outside of the body. The pleasant sensation that occurs
along with the muscle contractions (ejaculation) is called orgasm.
Orgasm and ejaculation are the result of stimulation by the other side of the
autonomic nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system. As the stimula-
tion causes contraction of the muscles, it closes the muscle over the bladder
so that urine does not normally accompany expulsion of semen and the
semen does not go back into the bladder.
Diabetes can damage the parasympathetic nervous system so that the male
cannot get an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. The sympathetic ner-
vous system is spared, so that ejaculation and orgasm can occur, but inter-
course may be unpleasant for both partners because of the psychological
consequence of not being able to sustain a firm erection.
The onset of failure of erection is determined by the following factors:
 Degree of control of the blood glucose: Better control is associated
with fewer problems.
 Duration of the diabetes: The longer you have diabetes, the more likely
you will be unable to have an erection.
102
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

 Interaction with your partner: A positive relationship is important.
 Use of drugs, tobacco, or alcohol: Both may prevent erection.
 State of mind: A positive frame of mind is associated with more success-
ful erections.
Discussing ED with your doctor
Although sexual intercourse tends to be an embarrassing topic for many men
and women, if you have diabetes and have a problem in this key area of life,
you need to discuss it with your doctor. Some doctors find this topic just as
embarrassing as some patients. Any doctor who treats patients with diabetes
should bring the topic up in the first meeting and annually thereafter. If he or
she does not, it is up to you to broach the subject. If you read the explanation
of the normal development of an erection and your experience differs from
that, discuss it with your physician. There are so many ways to treat it, and
the lack of an erection can have such a profound effect upon your self-esteem
and your relationship with another person that it is sad to discover how
often a new patient has been suffering in silence for years.
Treatment for erectile dysfunction
Fortunately for the male with diabetes with erectile dysfunction, numerous
approaches to treatment exist, beginning with drugs, continuing with exter-
nal devices to create an erection, and ending with implantable devices that
provide a very satisfactory erection. Treatment is successful in 90 percent or
more of men, but only 5 percent ever discuss the problem with their doctors.
The following sections discuss these treatment options:
Viagra and similar medications
Viagra, also called sildenafil, has been specifically studied in males with dia-
betes and is successful in 70 percent of patients.
Viagra does not seem to affect diabetic control, but it is not free of side effects.
Some men experience headaches, facial flushing, or indigestion, which gener-
ally decline with continued use of the drug. Viagra has also been found to
cause a temporary color tinge to a man’s vision, as well as increased sensitiv-
ity to light and blurred vision. These side effects also decline with continued
use of the drug.
Viagra is taken no more than once a day, about an hour before sexual activity.
While the starting dose is 50 milligrams for men, when diabetes is present,
100 mg is often required. The drug itself doesn’t cause erections; an erection
occurs only as a result of some kind of sexual stimulation. But Viagra does
103
Chapter 6: Diabetes, Sexual Function, and Pregnancy

prevent an erection from subsiding so that it lasts longer. The effects of Viagra
can last for four to six hours after taking it.
Pfizer, which makes Viagra, could not expect to have the playing field to itself
for very long, given that the game is something most men want to play. Bayer
Pharmaceuticals and GlaxoSmithKline have now brought vardenafil, which they
call Levitra, to the marketplace. Its characteristics are very similar to Viagra but
the dosage is 10 mg, which probably means 20 mg for men with diabetes.
Eli Lilly and ICOS Corporation have brought out tadalafil, which they call
Cialis. It works like Viagra and Levitra but stays active for 36 hours. In addi-
tion, its onset of action is 20 minutes, half the time of Viagra or Levitra. Cialis
has been nicknamed the “weekender pill” because it permits spontaneous
sexual activity from Friday to Sunday. The starting dose for Cialis is 20 mg,
but, again, the male with diabetes may need to start at twice that amount.
Some men must not take Viagra or the other two drugs. Men who have chest
pain often take nitrate drugs, the most common of which is nitroglycerine.
The combination of Viagra and nitrates may cause a significant and possibly
fatal drop in blood pressure.
In October 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began to receive
reports of sudden loss of hearing in men taking the drugs described above.
Some of the men also reported dizziness and ringing in the ear. The hearing
loss was temporary in one third of cases and too recent in the others. It
begins within hours to a day or two of starting these drugs. It involves only
one ear. There have been only 29 cases among the millions who have taken
the drugs beginning in 1996. If you experience hearing loss, take no more of
the drug and report it to your doctor. Since the side effect is so rare, it should
not prevent you from using the drugs, but you should be aware of it.
Injection into the penis
The patient himself can use two different kinds of injections to create an erec-
tion. The first one, a mixture of the drugs papaverine and phentolamine, has
for the most part been replaced by alprostadil (Caverject or Edex), a chemi-
cal that relaxes the blood vessels in the penis to allow more flow. Alprostadil
does not require sexual stimulation in order to work.
The drug is injected about 30 minutes before intercourse and no more than
once in 24 hours and three times per week. An injection of either preparation
gives a full erection lasting about an hour in 85 to 95 percent of men, except
for those who have the most severe loss of blood flow to the penis.
Complications of injections are rare but include bruising, pain, and the forma-
tion of nodules at the injection site. A very rare complication is priapism,
where the penis maintains its erection for many hours. If the erection lasts
more than four hours, the patient must see his doctor to get an injection of a
vasoconstrictor, a drug that squeezes down the arteries into the penis so that
blood flow is interrupted.
104
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Suppository in the penis
Alprostadil — the chemical that can be injected into the penis — also comes
in a suppository form. The patient inserts a tube containing this small pill
into the opening of the penis after urination. When the tube is fully in the
opening, the man squeezes the top so that the pill exits the tube. This prepa-
ration, called MUSE, comes in several different strengths so that patients can
use a higher dose if the lower dose does not result in a satisfactory erection.
It may safely be used twice in 24 hours. A few men experience pain with this
procedure. Sexual stimulation is unnecessary to achieve an erection.
Vacuum constriction devices
These tubes, which fit over the penis, create a closed space when pressed
against the patient’s body. A pump draws out the air in the tube, and blood
rushes into the penis to replace the air. When the penis is erect, a rubber
band is placed around the base of the penis to keep the blood inside it.
Sometimes pain and numbness of the penis occur. Because a rubber band is
constricting the penis, semen does not get through, so conception does not
take place. The rubber band may be kept on for up to 30 minutes.
Implanted penile prostheses
If the patient doesn’t like the idea of injecting himself in his penis or using a
vacuum device, and if Viagra does not work for him, a prosthesis (an artificial
substitute) can be implanted in the penis to give a very satisfactory erection.
Prostheses come in several varieties. A semi-rigid type produces a permanent
erection, but some men do not like the inconvenience of a permanent erection.
An inflatable prosthesis involves a pump in the scrotal sac that contains fluid.
The pump can be squeezed to transfer the fluid into balloons in the penis to
stiffen it. When not pumped up, the penis appears normally soft. In the past
few years, the surgery to insert these prostheses has become very satisfactory.
Facing Female Sexual Problems
Because women don’t have penises that must enlarge during sex, sexual dys-
function is not as visually obvious as it is in men. But as many as half of the
women with diabetes have problems with sexual function, and, the problems
can be just as difficult to handle as they are for men. The following problems
are associated with diabetes:
 You may have a dry mouth and dry vagina because of the high blood
glucose.
 Your menstrual function may be irregular when your diabetes is out of
control.
 You may develop yeast infections of the vagina that make intercourse
unpleasant.
105
Chapter 6: Diabetes, Sexual Function, and Pregnancy

 Because type 2 diabetes is usually associated with obesity, you may feel
fat and unattractive.
 You may feel uncomfortable discussing the problem with your partner
or your physician.
 You may have loss of bladder control due to a neurogenic bladder (see
Chapter 5).
 Your increasing age may cause a reduction in estrogen secretion and the
vaginal thinning and dryness associated with that change.
Menopause can cause several of the same difficulties as diabetes-related
sexual dysfunction, particularly the dry vagina and irregular menstrual func-
tion. You must rule out menopause before assuming that diabetes is the
source of the problem. Unlike the case with men with diabetes, this is the
only important abnormality that is known to cause sexual problems in
women that may simulate the problems of diabetes.
The female with long-standing diabetes may have several other problems
that are specific to her sexual organs. These problems include
 Reduced lubrication because of parasympathetic nerve involvement:
Lubrication serves to permit easier entry of the penis, but it also
increases the sensitivity of the vagina to touch, thus increasing pleasant
sensations.
 Reduced blood flow because of diabetic blood vessel disease: Some of
the lubrication comes from fluid within the blood vessels.
 Loss of skin sensation around the vaginal area: This loss reduces 
pleasure.
Most women who have problems with lubrication, whether due to diabetes
or menopause, medicate themselves with over-the-counter preparations.
These preparations fall into three categories:
 Water-based lubricants, like K-Y jelly and In Pursuit of Passion, which
are probably the easiest to use and clean up
 Oil-based lubricants, like vegetable oils
 Petroleum-based lubricants, which are not recommended because of the
possibility of bacterial infection
Estrogen, which can be taken by mouth or placed in the dry vagina in sup-
pository form, also may be useful for the menopausal woman.
When psychological or interpersonal issues exist, a discussion with a thera-
pist, the use of antidepressant medications (some of which can dry the
vagina, by the way), and sex therapy with your partner are important steps
to take to improve sexual pleasure.
106
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

As with all of the diabetic problems you read about in this book, maximum con-
trol of the blood glucose prevents or slows down a lot of these complications.
Striving for a Healthy Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a mother with diabetes is definitely more complicated than in a
mother without diabetes. For this reason, diabetes centers around the coun-
try employ the latest techniques and equipment and make knowledgeable
health care workers available.
About 0.4 percent of pregnancies occur in women with preexisting diabetes,
called pregestational diabetes, and an additional 2 to 4 percent occur in
women who develop diabetes sometime in the second half of the pregnancy,
called gestational diabetes. Four million births occur in the United States
annually, and diabetes affects 100,000 or more pregnancies each year.
If you have diabetes and want to become pregnant, you need to confer with
an expert in pregnancy and diabetes before you conceive. In the following
sections, I explain potential complications you may experience and some
steps you should take to ensure the healthiest pregnancy possible.
Realizing the body’s reaction to pregnancy
In a nondiabetic pregnancy, the woman’s body makes enough insulin to over-
come the effect of pregnancy hormones (which block insulin action), and her
blood glucose stays normal. But a woman with type 1 diabetes can’t make
more insulin, and during pregnancy she needs two or three times her usual
dose to counteract the effect of her hormones. This increased need for
insulin in a woman with type 1 diabetes usually stabilizes in the last several
weeks of the pregnancy; by the last one or two weeks, the mother-to-be may
actually begin to have hypoglycemia. After the baby and the placenta are
delivered, her insulin needs plummet immediately.
A woman with type 1 diabetes may have some retinopathy (see Chapter 5)
before she becomes pregnant. If the condition is severe, her eyes may deteri-
orate during the pregnancy. Although scientists aren’t yet clear on why this
tendency to deteriorate increases during pregnancy, the deterioration proba-
bly results from rapid improvement of blood glucose control in a woman who
has been poorly controlled previously. If glucose control is improved or if
laser photocoagulation (see Chapter 5) is carried out before the pregnancy,
this deterioration does not take place. After the baby is delivered, her eyes
will return to their previous state.
There is much more about pregnancy in the woman with type 1 diabetes in
my book Type 1 Diabetes For Dummies (Wiley).
107
Chapter 6: Diabetes, Sexual Function, and Pregnancy

If you’re thinking about becoming pregnant and you have diabetes-related
eye disease, that condition must be stabilized before you try to conceive.
Kidney disease, or nephropathy (see Chapter 5), increases the danger of com-
plications of pregnancy for both the mother and baby. Severe, permanent
worsening of the nephropathy is unusual as a result of pregnancy, but a tem-
porary decline in kidney function in the mother may occur. The baby may
have to be delivered early and may suffer some growth retardation.
Being proactive before 
and during pregnancy
You must take action in advance to avoid potential problems by controlling
your glucose before conception. (See Part III for more on how to manage 
your diabetes.) In addition, you need to monitor your diet after you become
pregnant.
Following are some other key steps you should take to improve your chances
or a problem-free pregnancy:
 Lose weight: Obesity, which is prevalent in type 2 patients, puts a mom-
to-be at greater risk for hypertension during pregnancy.
 Quit smoking: Children of mothers who smoke during pregnancy are at
much greater risk of developing obesity and diabetes later in life.
 Use insulin for glucose control: If you have type 2 diabetes and are
taking oral agents to lower your glucose, you need to switch to insulin to
control your glucose during pregnancy.
For more detailed information about what to do during pregnancy, see the
section “Treating diabetes during pregnancy,” later in the chapter.
Most diabetic pregnancies can be allowed to go to term at 39 weeks. However,
if the mother-to-be has hypertension or a previous history of delivery prob-
lems, her doctor may advocate earlier delivery.
Diagnosing gestational diabetes
Experts disagree as to whether all pregnant women who don’t already have
diabetes need to be checked for it. Some advocate selective screening, sug-
gesting that a thin pregnant woman with no family history of diabetes who is
physically active is an unlikely candidate for diabetes. You are unlikely to
develop gestational diabetes if you have the following characteristics:
108
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

 You are less than 25 years old
 Your weight is normal before the pregnancy
 You are not a member of an ethnic group with a high incidence of type 2
diabetes (Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Native Americans,
Pacific Islanders)
 There is no family history of diabetes in mother, father, sisters, brothers,
or other children
 You have no previous history of abnormal tolerance to glucose
 You have no previous history of poor outcome of a birth or have previ-
ously given birth to a large baby
However, the current consensus is to screen all women because a small but
significant number of patients with gestational diabetes will be missed if all
women are not screened.
Everyone agrees that if your glucose tolerance is normal in weeks 27 to 31 of
the pregnancy, you don’t need to do more screening. If you experienced ges-
tational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, the screening test is done much
earlier — as early as the 13th week. Other reasons for earlier screening are
 Previous delivery of a large baby
 Obesity
 Glucose in the urine
 Close family members with diabetes
The screening test is done between weeks 24 and 28 of the pregnancy. No
preparation is necessary. You consume 50 grams of glucose, and a blood glu-
cose level is obtained from a vein one hour later. If the glucose level is less
than 140, it’s considered normal. If it’s greater than 140, a further test is done
before making a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, because many women who
have a value greater than 140 do not necessarily have diabetes. The definitive
test is done as follows:
 The woman prepares by eating at least 150 grams of carbohydrate daily
for three days and then fasting for at least eight hours before the test.
 The woman drinks 100 grams of glucose to begin the test.
 Blood glucose is measured before the glucose meal and at one hour, two
hours, and three hours after drinking the glucose.
 A diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made if two or more of the samples
exceed the levels in Table 6-1.

Realizing risks to mother and baby
Whether you have diabetes before pregnancy or develop gestational dia-
betes, you face many considerations regarding your own health and the
health of your baby.
Persistently high blood glucose left untreated has major consequences for
both mother and fetus. If high glucose is present early in the pregnancy, the
result may be congenital malformations (physical abnormalities that may be
life threatening) in the fetus. In the third trimester, the growing fetus may
exhibit macrosomia (abnormal largeness; see Figure 6-1) that can lead to an
early delivery or damage to the baby or mother during delivery.
Babies develop normally if their fathers have diabetes but their mothers
don’t. The environment in which the fetus is developing is responsible for the
potential abnormalities. Elevated blood glucose, abnormalities of proteins
and fats that result from the elevated glucose, and the loss of sensitivity to
insulin explain the problems.

macrosomia.

Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Early pregnancy problems
The major concern of a woman with pregestational diabetes is to be under
good blood glucose control at the time of conception. Both miscarriages and
congenital malformations are a result of poor glucose control at conception
and shortly thereafter. Both high blood glucose and low blood glucose can
induce malformations. (For more on managing diabetes, see Part III.)
However, a woman in poor control of her diabetes has more trouble conceiv-
ing a baby than a woman with good glucose control, which may be the major
reason that more babies aren’t born with congenital malformations.
The woman who has gestational diabetes mellitus does not have to worry
that her baby’s likelihood of having congenital malformations is greater than
a baby whose mother does not have diabetes. This likelihood is because her
blood glucose did not start to rise until halfway through the pregnancy, long
after the baby’s important body structures were formed.
Late pregnancy problems
A baby is considered large if it weighs more than 4 kilograms or 8.8 pounds at
birth. Keep in mind that most large babies are the healthy offspring of moth-
ers without diabetes. Their growth is proportional throughout the pregnancy
so that their shoulders are not out of proportion to their heads, and delivery
is not complicated.
However, both the woman with pregestational diabetes and the woman with
gestational diabetes need to be concerned about having a large baby. This
largeness is not proportional. The areas that are most responsive to insulin,
where fat is stored in the baby, are the ones that enlarge the most. (See the
sidebar “Why macrosomia occurs” for more information.)
111
Chapter 6: Diabetes, Sexual Function, and Pregnancy
Measuring the risks
The hemoglobin A1c (see Chapter 7) is an excel-
lent measurement of overall glucose control
and provides a good indicator for the risk of mis-
carriage. If a pregnant woman’s hemoglobin
A1c is high, it indicates that she was in poor glu-
cose control at conception, and the likelihood
of a miscarriage is greater. If overall glucose
control is normal, the baby of the woman with
diabetes is no more likely to be miscarried than
that of a woman without diabetes.
The situation for congenital malformations is a
little more complicated. The occurrence of
these malformations rises with increasing glu-
cose, but the level of ketones (the breakdown
product of fats) also impacts their occurrence.
However, measuring the ketones will not tell
you if malformations will definitely occur.

Treating diabetes during pregnancy
In addition to controlling your glucose levels before conceiving, if you have
pregestational diabetes, you need to do the following:
 Discontinue taking prescription drugs that can harm a fetus.
 Have your eyes, kidneys, and blood pressure evaluated to establish a
baseline for future damage control.
 Stop tobacco and alcohol use.
You need to achieve a stricter level of glucose control during pregnancy than
when you aren’t pregnant. Your fetus is removing glucose from you at a rapid
rate, so your blood glucose level is lower than usual. In addition, your body
turns to fat for fuel much sooner, so you produce ketones earlier. Too many
ketones can damage the fetus as well. The fact that you break down fat so
early is termed accelerated starvation.
Monitoring your glucose and ketones
In order to maintain your blood glucose at the proper level, you must mea-
sure it more frequently. You should measure it before meals, at bedtime, and
occasionally one hour after eating. Your goal is to achieve the levels of blood
glucose listed in Table 6-2.

Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 
Why macrosomia occurs
Macrosomia, or abnormal largeness in a fetus,
has to do with the elevated glucose, fat, and
amino acid levels in the second half of preg-
nancy for a mother with diabetes. If these levels
aren’t lowered, the fetus is exposed to high
levels. The high levels, especially of glucose,
stimulate the fetal pancreas to begin to make
insulin earlier and to store these extra nutrients.
The fetus becomes large wherever fat is stored,
such as in the shoulders, chest, abdomen, arms,
and legs. Because they are large, macrosomic
babies are delivered early in order to make the
delivery easier and avoid birth trauma. However,
though they are large, they are not fully mature.

Recent studies have shown that the glucose level one hour after eating may
be the most important for the pregnant woman with diabetes to keep under
control. Although you can deliver insulin in other ways besides a syringe and
needle (see Chapter 10), several studies indicate that the syringe-and-needle
method is as effective as any other for the pregnant woman with diabetes.
You also need to check for ketones in the urine before breakfast and before
supper. You can do so by placing a test strip in the stream of urine. The strip
indicates whether ketones are present. If the test strip is positive, it means
that you are not eating enough carbohydrates and your body is going into
accelerated starvation. Too much of this condition is not good for the grow-
ing fetus.
Eating well
Your appropriate amount of weight gain depends upon your weight at the
time you become pregnant. Your BMI determines your weight gain. You need
to determine your BMI (see Chapter 3 if you’re not sure how to do this calcu-
lation). If your BMI is normal, you should gain 20 to 25 pounds during the
pregnancy. However, if you’re overweight, you need to gain less weight through
the pregnancy, 15 to 20 pounds. If you’re obese, you should gain no more than
17 or 18 pounds. And if you’re underweight, you may gain 25 to 30 pounds.
Chapter 8 tells you what you need to know about diet and diabetes, but as a
pregnant woman with diabetes, you have some special requirements:
 Your daily food intake should be 35 to 38 kilocalories per kilogram of
ideal body weight. (In this book, I use the term kilocalories rather than
calories, which is an incorrect term.) You can use your height to deter-
mine your ideal body weight (IBW). As a woman, you should weigh 100
pounds if you are 5 feet tall, plus 5 pounds for every inch over 5 feet. For
example, a 5-foot 4-inch woman should weigh 120 pounds, ideally (and
approximately, because these numbers represent a range, not a single
weight). You can change that figure to kilograms by dividing the pounds
by 2.2. Then multiply that number by 35 to get the low end of the daily
calorie intake and by 38 to get the high end. So if you weigh 120 pounds,
you weigh 54.6 kilograms. Your daily food intake should be between
1,900 and 2,100 kilocalories.
 Your protein intake should be 1.5 to 2 grams per kilogram of IBW. The
woman with the IBW of 54.6 should eat about 110 grams of protein daily.
Because each gram of protein contains four kilocalories, protein takes
up about 440 of the 2,100 daily kilocalories.
 Your carbohydrate intake should be 50 to 55 percent of your daily 
kilocalories. If you need approximately 2,000 daily kilocalories, about 
1,000 kilocalories should be carbohydrate. Because each gram of 
113
Chapter 6: Diabetes, Sexual Function, and Pregnancy

carbohydrate has 4 kilocalories, just like protein, this amounts to 250
grams of carbohydrate.
 Your fat intake should be less than 30 percent of the total daily kilo-
calories. Using 2,000 kilocalories as our target, that amounts to 630 kilo-
calories of fat. Because fat contains 9 kilocalories per gram, this equals
70 grams of fat a day.
Translating grams of food into amounts of specific foods would require
another whole book. Because an excellent one on the subject has
already been written, I refer you to Nutrition For Dummies, 3rd Edition,
by Carol Ann Rinzler (Wiley) to get this information.
 You need to eat three meals a day plus a bedtime snack. Frequently
eating helps prevent the accelerated starvation that results from the
prolonged fast between supper and breakfast.
 You must maintain fasting and premeal glucose levels below 90 mg/dl.
Your glucose should be less than 120 mg/dl one hour after meals.
In addition, you can use a good multivitamin and mineral preparation. A mod-
erate amount of exercise is also very helpful in controlling the blood glucose
and keeping you in top shape during pregnancy.
Testing for fetal defects
A blood test called a serum alpha-fetoprotein can be done 15 weeks into the
pregnancy to determine whether neural tube defects exist in the fetus. At 18
weeks, an ultrasound can show any malformations of the growing fetus. An
ultrasound, by directing a sound at the fetus and catching it as it bounces back
to the machine, produces a picture of the fetus that shows the presence of any
abnormalities. This harmless test is not painful for the mother or the fetus.
Another useful study during the diabetic pregnancy is the non-stress test. A
device is placed on your abdomen that listens to the fetus’s heartbeat. When
the fetus moves, its heart rate normally speeds up by 15 to 20 beats per minute.
This increase in heart rate should normally occur at least three times in a 
20-minute period of listening.
Handling issues of gestational diabetes
If you have gestational diabetes, you need not worry about congenital malfor-
mations in your baby, but you need to avoid macrosomia. You need to follow
the same dietary prescription as the woman with pregestational diabetes, and
you need to use insulin if a careful diet does not keep your fasting blood glu-
cose below 90, your glucose one hour after eating below 120, or your glucose
two hours after eating below 120. If you can’t bring yourself to use insulin
shots, glyburide (see Chapter 10) has been shown not to harm the baby since
it does not pass through the placenta, although it is not approved by the FDA
for this use. Your insulin regimen will probably be simpler than that of the
woman with pregestational diabetes because your pancreas can make its own
insulin. If you are taking insulin, you will stop doing so at the time of delivery.
114
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

Early ultrasound is not necessary for the woman with gestational diabetes
unless your doctor suspects that the diabetes was actually there much ear-
lier. An ultrasound at week 38 can show whether fetal macrosomia exists. If
macrosomia is present, your doctor will probably perform a caesarean sec-
tion, where the baby is removed through an incision made in the abdominal
wall and then in the uterus.
Delivering the baby
It’s best for a woman with diabetes to deliver her baby at the end of 39
weeks, when it has had a chance to mature completely. If the mother does
not go into labor spontaneously, the physician usually induces labor.
If you have been taking insulin during pregnancy, nurses will monitor your
blood glucose every four hours after you deliver. You blood glucose will be
maintained at 70 to 120 mg/dl with insulin, if necessary. The insulin is given in
short-acting form as needed and not in large doses of long-acting insulin,
which would be around in the circulation when you no longer need it.
Maintaining your health after pregnancy
If you are breastfeeding, which is always a good idea, you need to consume
about 300 kilocalories above your usual needs. You cannot take oral agents
for diabetes because these pass through the milk into the baby. For more
information about breastfeeding, see Breastfeeding For Dummies by Sharon
Perkins and Carol Vannais (Wiley).
For the woman with gestational diabetes, the disease usually disappears
when the pregnancy is over. However, a woman who develops gestational dia-
betes during pregnancy is at a much higher risk for developing diabetes later
in life. If your fasting blood glucose is greater than 130 during pregnancy, the
risk of developing diabetes again is as much as 75 to 90 percent in the next 
10 to 15 years.
If you had gestational diabetes, you need to have a test for glucose tolerance
between 6 and 12 weeks after the pregnancy and annually after that if dia-
betes is not found.
Several factors predispose the woman with gestational diabetes to develop
diabetes later on. Some factors that cannot be changed include the following:
 Ethnic origin: Certain ethnic groups, such as Mexican Americans, Native
Americans, Asian Americans, and African Americans, are at a higher risk.
 Prepregnancy weight: Women with a higher prepregnancy weight are at
a higher risk.
 Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you have, the higher
your risk.
115
Chapter 6: Diabetes, Sexual Function, and Pregnancy

 Family history of diabetes: If a family history is present, you are at a
higher risk.
 Severity of blood glucose during pregnancy: Higher blood glucose
levels mean a higher risk.
On the other hand, you can reduce several risk factors:
 Future weight gain: Gain less weight in future pregnancies.
 Future pregnancies: Have fewer children.
 Physical activity: Increase your exercise.
 Dietary fat: Limit the fat in your diet.
 Smoking and certain drugs: Stop smoking and using drugs.
Women who have had gestational diabetes can use oral contraceptives with
low levels of estrogen and progesterone to prevent conception. These drugs,
along with hormonal replacement therapy after menopause, do not increase
your risk of later diabetes. They may, in fact, decrease the risk and decrease
blood glucose levels in those who have diabetes already. Women with type 1
and type 2 diabetes can use the same preparations.
The story is similar for postmenopausal women. A study in Diabetes Care in
October 2003 showed that the use of estrogens (with or without progestins)
by women with diabetes resulted in a decrease in coronary artery disease.
Because women with diabetes are at very high risk for coronary artery dis-
ease, this finding is an important one.
Another large study reported that women on hormone replacement therapy
have better control of their blood glucose than those not on such treatment.
This information was reported in Diabetes Care in July 2001.
Focusing on your baby’s health
Increased understanding of diabetes’s impact during pregnancy has resulted
in a great reduction in malformations in these babies as well as the macroso-
mia that leads to complications at delivery. Unfortunately, many women with
diabetes do not have tight glucose control at conception, so some malforma-
tions still occur. If an obvious malformation is present at birth, it is important
to search for other malformations.
Also, keep in mind that the fetus was producing a lot of insulin to handle all
the maternal glucose entering through the placenta. Suddenly, maternal glu-
cose is cut off at delivery, but the high level of fetal insulin continues for a
while. The danger of hypoglycemia exists in the first four to six hours after
delivery. The baby may be sweaty and appear nervous or even have a
116
Part II: How Diabetes Affects Your Body 

seizure. It is necessary to do blood glucose tests on the baby hourly until he
or she is stable and to continue testing at intervals for the first 24 hours.
Besides hypoglycemia, the baby may have several other complications right
after birth:
 Respiratory distress syndrome: This breathing problem occurs when
the baby is delivered early, but it responds to treatment. This condition
is rare with good prenatal care.
 Low calcium with jitteriness and possible seizures: Calcium needs to
be given to the baby until its own body can take over. This condition is
usually a result of prematurity.
 Low magnesium: This complication presents itself like low calcium and
is also a result of prematurity.
 Polycythemia: This condition, where too many red blood cells exist,
occurs for unknown reasons. Treatment requires removing blood from
the baby. The amount is determined by how much extra blood is present.
 Hyperbilirubinemia: This condition is the product of too much break-
down of red blood cells. It is treated with light.
 Lazy left colon: Occurring for unknown reasons, this condition presents
itself like an obstruction of the bowel but clears up on its own.
If the baby was exposed to high glucose and ketones during the pregnancy, it
may show diminished intelligence. This effect is not obvious at birth but is
discovered later when the baby is expected to learn something.
The large baby of the poorly controlled mother with diabetes usually loses its
fat by age 1. Starting at ages 6 to 8, however, the child has a greater tendency
to be obese. Controlling the blood glucose in the mother may prevent later
obesity and even diabetes in her offspring.
Identifying Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is responsible for abnormal menstrual
function in 5 to 8 percent or more of women during their reproductive years.
It tends to run in families. Women with this condition have trouble conceiving
a child, and they have increased hair on their faces, arms, legs, and areas of
the body that are not usually hairy in women. In addition, they experience
acne and obesity.
The surprise finding in PCOS is that these women are also resistant to insulin
and have increased blood levels of insulin even when they are not obese. The
greater the degree of obesity, however, the more frequent that the metabolic
117
Chapter 6: Diabetes, Sexual Function, and Pregnancy

syndrome is present (see Chapter 5). In fact, women with PCOS who do get
pregnant have a prevalence of gestational diabetes that is 2 to 3 times that of
those women without PCOS. 
Another feature that women with PCOS have in common with metabolic syn-
drome is obstructive sleep apnea. This sleep apnea results in daytime sleepi-
ness and high blood pressure.
The name of the syndrome derives from the fact that early cases of PCOS
were associated with multiple ovarian cysts. More recently, the presence of
ovarian cysts has not been a prominent feature of the condition, but the
name has stuck.
Women with PCOS have increased levels of male-associated hormones called
androgens. Studies have shown that androgens cause decreased insulin sensi-
tivity when they are given to women who don’t have PCOS.
The major health risks for someone with PCOS, besides infertility, are the
occurrence of impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, as well as ges-
tational diabetes. In addition, just like patients with the metabolic syndrome
(see Chapter 5), these women are at greater risk for high blood pressure,
abnormal blood fats, and cardiovascular disease.
The most effective treatment for PCOS is lifestyle change. Weight loss and exer-
cise often reverse the condition and prevent the development of diabetes. In
very obese women with PCOS, weight loss surgery will reverse PCOS. Oral con-
traceptives have been used in the past when more treatment is needed, but
these don’t restore fertility, which is often the main purpose of treatment. They
can still be used to control the other symptoms, such as acne and increased
hair. Insulin sensitizing drugs, including metformin, and pioglitazone (see
Chapter 10), have been very effective for treating all features of the syndrome.
In a study reported in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism in
April 2005, six months of metformin was much more effective than a drug
called clomiphene, a well known inducer of ovulation, in restoring fertility.
Other than oral contraceptives, any treatment that is successful for reducing
the acne, hairiness, and decreased insulin sensitivity in PCOS also makes the
woman much more liable to get pregnant. If she doesn’t want to become preg-
nant, she and her partner need to take the necessary precautions.

s it possible that you could be healthier with diabetes
than your friends who do not have diabetes? This part
shows that the answer to that question is yes. While others
continue their bad habits leading to illness and perhaps
premature death, you can find out exactly what you have
to do not just to live with diabetes but to thrive with dia-
betes. The steps you need to take are simple and basic
and involve changes in lifestyle, what and how much you
eat as well as your physical fitness. You will probably ask
yourself as you’re reading, “Why didn’t I think of that?”
You will find out how to choose from the vast number of
products like glucose meters that help you to manage
your disease. You will discover that you can have diabetes
and enjoy delicious food. I introduce you to the concept of
taking at least 10K (10,000 steps) a day. New medications
are appearing regularly and you need to understand how
to use them properly. Another function of this part is to
show you that lots of people — some of whom you may
not have thought of — are out there to provide the infor-
mation that you need to know.

You may wonder what you have to do to prevent the complications of dia-
betes that I describe in Chapters 4 through 6 — a fair amount, which I
discuss in this chapter. But when you weigh the benefits that add up to a
longer quality life against the loss of time and money from preventive care,
preventive care wins by a landslide.
With preventive care, you benefit from an explosion of new tests and treat-
ments that have only been available for the last 30 years, beginning with self-
testing of blood glucose in 1980 right up to new tests for overall diabetic
control and multiple new hardware and software tools made possible by the
latest advances in computer and Internet technology.
As Woody Allen points out, “I don’t want to achieve immortality through my
work; I want to achieve it by never dying.” On the other hand, he says, “On
the plus side, death is one of the few things that can be done as easily as
lying down.” Well, I don’t want you to take your diabetes lying down. I want to
give you the benefit of every important advance. You may not achieve immor-
tality, but you will enjoy every day that you live.

This chapter gives you all the tools you need to detect complications in their
earliest stages. And if, by chance, you are reading this section for the first time
and complications have already developed, this chapter also shows you how
to measure the progression or, hopefully, regression of your complications.
Testing, Testing: Tests You 
Need to Stay Healthy
A number of tests and measurements should be done on a regular basis. To
best make sure that you get your tests done regularly, you can use the chart
in Figure 7-1. This form lists the tests and you can list the results underneath.
Simply copy the one in Figure 7-1 and keep it up to date. Don’t expect your
doctor to keep this chart updated for you. He has too much on his mind and
too many patients to get it exactly right for each one.

Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Certain procedures should be done by your doctor (and you, if feasible)
according to the following schedule:
 Evaluate your blood glucose measurements at each visit. (See the sec-
tion “Monitoring Blood Glucose: It’s a Must,” later in this chapter.)
 Obtain hemoglobin A1c four times a year if you take insulin and twice a
year if you don’t. (See the section “Tracking Your Glucose over Time:
Hemoglobin A1c,” later in this chapter.)
 Check for microalbuminuria once a year. (See the section “Testing for
Kidney Damage: Microalbuminuria,” later in this chapter.)
 Have a dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist
once a year. (See the section “Checking for Eye Problems,” later in this
chapter.)
 Examine your bare feet at each visit. (See the section “Examining Your
Feet,” later in this chapter.)
 Have an ankle-brachial index performed at least every five years. (See
the section “Examining Your Feet,” later in this chapter.)
 Obtain a lipid panel once a year. (See the section “Tracking Cholesterol
and Other Fats,” later in this chapter.)
 Measure your blood pressure at each visit. (See the section “Measuring
Blood Pressure,” later in this chapter.)
 Measure your weight at each visit. (See the section “Checking Your
Weight and BMI,” later in this chapter.)
These tests are the minimum standards for proper care of diabetes. If an
abnormality is found, the frequency of testing increases to check on the
response to treatment.
Are we doing the best job of managing diabetes? Government statistics on
“Preventive Care Practices” from the Centers For Disease Control and
Prevention suggest that we are not. And we don’t seem to be getting much
better as diabetes becomes a major health problem in the US. The latest sta-
tistics compare the annual rates of testing for various abnormalities associ-
ated with diabetes between 1994 and 2005. They indicate some improvement
but we should be doing a whole lot better.
The results were as follows:
 In 1994, 57 percent of people with diabetes had an annual eye examina-
tion. By 2005 it had grown to only 60.6 percent.
 In 1994, 79 percent of people with diabetes had at least one visit to a
doctor in a year. By 2005 the number was up to only 87.7 percent.
123
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

 In 1994, 48 percent of people with diabetes had a foot examination in the
previous year. By 2005 it was only up to 66 percent.
 In 2000, 66 percent of people with diabetes had two or more hemoglobin
A1c tests in the past year, while in 2005 it had fallen to 64 percent.
 In 1994, 38 percent of people with diabetes were doing self-testing of
blood glucose. By 2005 it had only risen to 61.5 percent.
 In 2000, 62 percent of people with diabetes were examining their own
feet. By 2005 it was only 64 percent.
As we have gained knowledge about diabetes, the guidelines for how high
various tests should be in people with diabetes have changed. Unfortunately,
they seemed to have no effect on the results of clinical practice:
 After the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation
and Treatment of High Blood Pressure lowered its guidelines for blood
pressure in people with diabetes in 1997 and again in 2003, there was no
better control as late as 2005 according to an article in Diabetes Care in
January 2007.
 The American Diabetes Association lowered its goal for LDL cholesterol
(see below) to less than 100 mg/dl in 1998. As late as 2004 there was no
indication that patients were meeting the new goal more often than they
had in 1994.
There is much to be done. And that’s what this chapter is all about.
Monitoring Blood Glucose: It’s a Must
Insulin was extracted and used for the first time more than 80 years ago. Since
that time, nothing has improved the life of the person with diabetes as much
as the ability to measure his or her own blood glucose with a drop of blood.
Prior to blood glucose self-monitoring, testing the urine for glucose was the
only way to determine whether your blood glucose was high, but urine test-
ing could not tell at all whether the glucose was low. The urine test for glucose
is worthless for controlling blood glucose — it actually provides misinforma-
tion. All the thousands of research papers in the medical literature before
1980, which used urine testing for glucose, are of no value and should be
burned. (However, testing the urine for other things, such as ketones and pro-
tein, can be of value.)
Basically, two kinds of test strips are used today. Both require that glucose in
a drop of your blood reacts with an enzyme. In one strip, the reaction produces
124
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

a color. A meter then reads the amount of color to give a glucose reading. In
the other strip, the reaction produces electrons, and a meter converts the
amount of electrons into a glucose reading.
One of the first things that was learned when frequent testing of blood glu-
cose became feasible is that a person with diabetes, even a person who
works hard to control his glucose, can experience tremendous variation in
glucose levels in a relatively short time, as little as 30 minutes. This is espe-
cially true in association with food, but variations can occur even in the fast-
ing state before breakfast. For this reason multiple tests are needed.
How often should you test?
How often you test is determined by the kind of diabetes you have, the kind
of treatment you’re using, and the level of stability of your blood glucose.
 If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and you’re taking before-meal
insulin, you need to test before each meal and at bedtime. The reason
for this frequent testing is that you’re constantly using this information
to make adjustments in your insulin dose. No matter how good you think
your control is, you cannot feel the level of the blood glucose without
testing unless you’re hypoglycemic. In fact, I have had my patients try to
guess without testing on numerous occasions and then I test it. They are
close less than 50 percent of the time. That degree of accuracy is not suf-
ficient for good glucose control.
People with type 1 diabetes should occasionally test one hour after a
meal and in the middle of the night to see just how high their glucose
goes after eating and whether it drops too low in the middle of the 
night. These results guide you and your physician to make the changes
you need.
 If you have type 2 diabetes and you’re on pills or just diet and exer-
cise, testing twice a day (before breakfast and dinner) gives you the
information needed to measure the effect of the treatment. I’m assum-
ing that you’re fairly stable as shown by mostly good blood glucose tests
(in the range of 80 to 120 mg/dl) and by the hemoglobin A1c (which I dis-
cuss later in this chapter). I even have some of my most stable patients
testing only once a day, alternating a pre-breakfast test with a pre-supper
test on consecutive days. Any less testing than this minimal amount is
not enough to keep you aware of the state of your control.
 If you’re pregnant, see the testing guidelines I outline in Chapter 6. I
would guess that you’re probably willing to test numerous times in a day
to keep your developing fetus as healthy as possible.
125
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

The blood glucose test can be useful many other times of day:
 If you eat something off your diet and want to test its effect on your glu-
cose, do a test.
 If you’re about to exercise, a blood glucose test can tell you whether you
need to eat before starting the exercise or can use the exercise to bring
your glucose down.
 If your diabetes is temporarily unstable and you’re about to drive, you
may want to test before getting into the car to make sure that you’re not
on the verge of hypoglycemia.
You’re not being graded on your glucose test results. The human body has
too much variation in it to expect that each time you take the same medica-
tion, do the same exercise, eat the same way, and feel the same emotionally,
you will get the same test result. If the person who reviews your results with
you sees your abnormal results as bad, he or she does not understand this
point. You may want to consider finding someone who does.
Keep in mind that the occasional blood glucose test done in your doctor’s
office is of little or no value in understanding the big picture of your glucose
control. It is like trying to visualize an entire painting by Seurat (who painted
using dots of color) by looking at one dot on the canvas.
Using a lancet
To get the drop of blood you need to perform a glucose test, you have to use
a spring-loaded device that contains a sharp lancet. You push the button of
the device, and the lancet springs out and pokes your finger.
One product that seems less painful than the others is the Softclix Lancet
Device. It allows you to select one of eleven depth settings so that you can
penetrate your finger no deeper than necessary. It uses its own type of lancet
that is a little more expensive than others on the market. Becton Dickinson
makes another lancet, called BDGenie Lancet, that works like a lancet and
lancing device all in one. It is less painful and a little less expensive than
other devices on the market. Becton Dickinson also makes the thinnest
lancets currently available, called the BD Ultra-Fine 33 Lancets.
Although you do not have to use alcohol on your fingers, they should be rea-
sonably clean. (My patients have done millions of finger sticks, and I’ve never
known one of them to have an infection result.) Use the side of your finger to
avoid the more sensitive tips that you don’t want to hurt, especially if you
use a keyboard frequently. Change fingers often so that no finger becomes
very sensitive.
126
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Remember never to use a used lancet on someone else. Each lancet lasts for
a few pokes and should then be discarded in a special sharps container so it
can’t poke someone else accidentally. Sharps containers are available in
drugstores.
How do you perform the test?
If you don’t already own a blood glucose meter, be sure to check out the next
section. All meters require a drop of blood, usually from the finger. (See the
previous section “Using a lancet.”) You place the blood on a specific part of a
test strip and allow enough time, usually between five seconds and one
minute, for a reaction to occur. Some strips allow you to add more blood
within 30 seconds if the quantity is insufficient. In less than a minute, the
meter reads the product of that reaction, which is determined by the amount
of glucose in the blood sample.
Keep the following tips in mind when you’re testing your glucose:
 If you have trouble getting blood, you can use a rubberband at the
point where your finger joins your hand. You will be amazed at the
flow of blood. Take off the rubberband before a major hemorrhage
occurs (just joking).
 Testing blood from sites other than your fingers is generally reliable,
except for an hour after eating or immediately after exercise.
 Some meters use whole blood, and some use the liquid part of the
blood, called the plasma. A lab glucose tests the plasma. The whole
blood value is about 12 percent less than the plasma value, so it is
important to know which you’re measuring. The various recommenda-
tions for appropriate levels of glucose are plasma values unless specifi-
cally stated otherwise. Most of the newer meters are calibrated to give a
plasma reading, but check yours to be sure.
 Studies have shown that the qualities of test strips, which are loose in
a vial, deteriorate rapidly if the vial is left open. Be sure to cap the
vial. Two hours of exposure to air may ruin the strips. Strips that are
individually foil-wrapped do not have this problem.
 Do not let others use your meter. Their test results will be mixed in with
your tests when they are downloaded into a computer. In addition, a
meter invariably gets a little blood on it and can be a source of infection.
127
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

Choosing a Blood Glucose Meter
So many meters are on the market that you may be confused about which
one to use. One consideration that should play little part in your decision is
the cost of the meter. Most manufacturers are happy to practically give you
the meter so that you’re forced to buy their test strips. Each manufacturer
makes a different test strip, and they’re not interchangeable in other
machines. Some even make a different strip for each different machine that
they make.
Because the meters are so cheap and the science is changing so rapidly, you
should get a new meter every year or two to make sure that you have state-
of-the-art equipment. The cost of test strips is generally about the same from
meter to meter, so the cost of strips does not have to play a big role in your
meter decision, either.
Another nonconsideration is the accuracy of the various machines. All are
accurate to a degree acceptable for managing your diabetes. Keep in mind,
though, that they do not have the accuracy of a laboratory. Meters are proba-
bly about plus or minus 10 percent compared to the lab.
Factors that may influence your purchase
Your doctor may have a meter that he or she prefers to work with because a
computer program can download the test results from the meter and display
them in a certain way. This analysis can be enormously helpful in deciding
how to alter your therapy for the best control of your glucose.
Any meter you buy should have a memory that records the time and date so
you can read that information along with the glucose result. The memory
should hold at least 100 glucose values if you test four times a day; 100 values
represents 25 days at this testing frequency.
Do not buy a meter without the capability to download the results to a data
management system in a computer. Bring your meter with you to your
appointments so that your doctor, or one of his or her assistants, can down-
load your glucose test results and evaluate them with the aid of a data man-
agement system. Evaluating pages of glucose readings in a log book is
virtually impossible. Your insurance company also may mandate a certain
meter, in which case you may have no choice.
128
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Ask yourself the following questions when choosing a meter:
 If a small child is to use it, can the child easily use the meter and strips?
 Are the batteries common ones, or are they hard to get and expensive?
 Does the meter have a memory that you and your doctor can check?
 Is the meter downloadable to a computer program that can manipulate
the data?
 Are the test strips reasonable in cost?
Profiles of different meters
There are more than a dozen companies vying for your meter purchase but
there are really four major players in the meter game and a few minor ones.
Among them, they produce more than 25 machines. Like everything in busi-
ness, mergers and acquisitions have occurred and will continue to happen so
that the field narrows. You’re probably wise to stick with one of the four
major companies, which I describe in the following sections, unless a minor
company comes out with irresistible features. Strips for the meters produced
by the major companies are widely available, and the companies tend to have
excellent service should you have a meter problem.
You want to know what I use in my practice? All of my patients use the Accu-
Chek Compact Plus meter or one of the other Roche Diagnostics meters that
utilizes the same data management system. The Compact Plus uses whole
blood, not plasma but the meter converts the result to a plasma value. I like it
because it has a drum that contains 17 test strips, which are wrapped up
until they are used. That means they are not subject to exposure to air. It also
allows you to add blood if the initial drop is not enough. Most importantly, it
is very fast and accurate. I like the data management system that the com-
pany provides to doctors (or you, if you call the company on the 800 number
on the meter) who use its meters.
Abbott Laboratories
Abbott Laboratories purchased the MediSense Company, which first made
and sold these meters. This company, which has one of the longest war-
ranties on its meters (four years), is speedy about taking care of problems
that arise. The batteries are good for 4,000 tests. They can generally be
replaced by you unless otherwise noted. One clue that Abbott is really inter-
ested in customer service is that you can find the Owner’s Guides for all their
meters on the Internet.
129
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

 Freestyle Flash: The manufacturer calls the Freestyle Flash the smallest
meter available. It requires a tiny sample of blood and you can add more
up to a minute from the first application if you don’t have enough on the
strip. The Flash works with a data management program called Precision
Link Direct Diabetes Data Management System. It will hold up to 250
tests, eliminating the oldest as new ones are added beyond 250, just like
all the other meters described in this section. You can see a 1-day aver-
age on the screen. You must set the meter to the code that is on the vial
of test strips you are currently using. The meter has programmable
alarms to remind you to test. It uses CR2032 “coin cell” batteries avail-
able at drugstores and grocery stores. You can test away from your
finger with this meter.
 Freestyle Freedom: This meter is identical to the Flash but it is larger
with a larger screen for people who have visual difficulties.
 Freestyle Lite: This meter uses different test strips from the two above
and does not require coding. It can remember 400 tests. Otherwise it is
similar in its properties to the meters above. 
 Precision Xtra: This meter allows measurement of blood ketones as 
well as glucose. It uses its own test strips that require calibration of the
meter with each new vial. The vial contains a calibration strip that is
inserted into the meter before using the test strips in that vial. If you
want to do a blood ketone test, you use the calibration strip that comes
in that vial before inserting the ketone strip. The meter remembers the
last 450 tests that you do and you can view 7-, 14-, and 30-day averages
on the screen. It uses the same data management system as the other
meters in the Abbott group.
Bayer Healthcare LLC
Bayer Healthcare LLC, which is a branch of Bayer Group (a German com-
pany), sells the following two meters in the United States but continues to
support several of its old meters (such as the Elite). The meters are accurate
and carry the longest warranty in the industry (five years). You can replace
the batteries at home. The meters are descendants of some of the first meters
available. They both allow testing away from your fingers. No coding of the
meters is required.
 Breeze 2: The Breeze 2 uses a 10-test cartridge that calibrates the meter.
It remembers 420 tests. It can provide 1-, 7-, 14-, and 30-day averages.
The meter uses WinGLUCOFACTS software for data management.
 Contour: This meter uses individual test strips that require no coding. It
remembers up to 480 tests that can be downloaded and viewed with the
same data management system as the Breeze 2. It can provide a 14-day
average on the screen. It uses 3-volt lithium batteries.
130
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

LifeScan
Johnson & Johnson purchased LifeScan, one of the older meter companies.
They have a number of meters in competition with one another. The company
is very reliable, taking care of problems within 24 hours. You can replace the
batteries in LifeScan meters at home. This company also posts its Owner’s
Manuals online in case to need to refer to them.
 One TouchUltra Mini: This meter is small and portable. It uses a tiny
blood sample. Each new vial of Ultra Mini test strips must be coded in
the meter. It uses a 3 volt CR 2032 coin cell battery. However it has no
way to download test results to a computer and no data management
system. Therefore I don’t recommend it.
 One Touch Ultra 2: This system allows testing away from the fingers. 
It uses a tiny sample and, therefore, can work with LifeScan’s ultrafine
lancets. The result is displayed in five seconds, and the blood is drawn
up by capillary action. The meter has a 500-test memory that allows
averaging on the screen and connects to a data port using One Touch
Diabetes Management software. You can see 7-, 14-, and 30-day averages.
It uses Ultra test strips. You use buttons on the meter to set the code on
the meter to the code on the bottle of test strips. You can add flags to
each blood glucose test to specify whether the glucose was taken before
or after a meal and whether food or exercise was involved. Testing may
be done away from the fingers. It uses 2 3-volt CR 2032 coin cell batter-
ies, one for the meter and one for the backlight. The test is measured
from whole blood but expressed in plasma referenced units.
 One Touch UltraSmart: This meter has all the features of the One Touch
Ultra 2 with the addition of other features. Using “smart buttons, you
can enter information about your exercise, health, medication, and food.
You are prompted to comment on out-of-range results. You can view
charts and graphs that help to analyze your blood glucose on the meter’s
screen. The UltraSmart uses two AAA batteries. You can see averages for
7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days. It can store over 3,000 test results. You can also
enter test results for hemoglobin A1c, microalbumin, cholesterol, blood
pressure, eye exams, foot exams, weight, height and dates of doctor’s
visits. You can enter the diabetes pills you take and insulin if you use
that. Finally, there is a food log book in which you can enter the meal and
the calories of fat, carbohydrate and protein. Once the information is in
the meter you can get outputs of average insulin used at different times,
average carbohydrates at different meals and so forth.
Roche Diagnostics
Roche Diagnostics, which did not sell meters originally, merged with Boehringer
Mannheim and now sells its meters. The batteries in these meters are replace-
able at home. The meters may be used at alternate sites besides the fingers.
131
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

 Accu-ChekAviva: This meter works with diabetes management software
(DMS). It has a very large memory, storing up to 500 blood glucose values,
with 7-, 14-, and 30- day averages on-screen. It requires a tiny sample of
blood. It comes with Spanish language instructions and a phone number
for a Spanish-speaking representative. It has a code key with each new
bottle of test strips that are made just for this meter. You can set test
reminders for up to 4 times a day with the built-in alarm. It uses a coin
cell 2032 battery.
 Accu-Chek Advantage: This meter also works with DMS and stores 350
blood glucose values. It uses a test strip that takes 27 seconds but does
not require cleaning or wiping, and it draws the blood up by capillary
action. It uses test strips that come with a code key that is inserted into
the meter for that bottle of strips. The strips are Accu-Chek Comfort
Curve test strips.
 Accu-Chek Compact Plus: This meter uses a 17-test drum that requires
no test strip handling or calibration. The results are displayed in 5 sec-
onds, and it has a 300-test memory that is downloadable to a DMS. You
can see onscreen 7-, 24-, and 30-day averages. It allows testing away from
the fingers.
 Accu-Chek Active: This meter uses a tiny sample of blood and gives a
result in five seconds. It has a 200-value memory that is downloadable to
a DMS and can show 7- and 14- day averages. It can be used at alternate
sites besides the fingers. It uses a new snap-in code key for each new
bottle of strips, made just for this meter.
 Accu-Chek Voicemate: This meter is for the visually impaired. It identi-
fies the type of insulin used, and it audibly takes the user through the
glucose test and gives the reading. It also uses the Comfort Curve test
strips that draw the blood in by capillary action, and it is downloadable
to a DMS.
Roche also makes a software program for people with diabetes called Accu-
Chek Compass. It helps patients to better manage their diabetes by providing
reports and summaries of the glucose tests.
Two noninvasive meters
Since individual blood glucose measurements represent only a moment in
time and blood glucose levels can change in minutes, devices that can mea-
sure blood glucose almost continuously, store the measurements, and down-
load them to a computer are being developed. They may replace the above
meters once they improve, but for now they often lag behind finger stick mea-
surements, especially after a meal or exercise. Each still requires that you
132
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

take blood glucose measurements using a finger stick meter to calibrate
these continuous meters.
They have their best use when the finger stick results do not correlate well
with the hemoglobin A1c measurements, which is especially the case in
people with diabetes who take insulin. The doctor, knowing the direction of
the blood glucose throughout 24 hours, can adjust the rapid-acting and long-
acting insulin more accurately without causing hypoglycemia.
Dexcom STS Continuous Blood Glucose Monitor known as the Seven System.
This monitor uses a sensor under the skin that wirelessly transmits glucose
readings from the fluid under the skin called the interstitial fluid to a monitor.
The monitor collects the information and displays it on a screen. The screen
can show 1-hour, 3-hour, and 9-hour trends as well as alert you when the
blood glucose goes above or below a set level. Also an alarm sounds when
the glucose is below 55 mg/dl. Software called Data Manager 2 helps to dis-
play the data on a computer for further understanding of trends. The device
is calibrated with a finger stick glucose every 12 hours. It can store up to 30
days of data. It has not been tested in children, adolescents, or pregnant
women.
This type of system can be used to design a very accurate program for giving
insulin. In the future, it could be hooked up to an insulin delivery device and
provide instant responses to changes in blood glucose. 
GlucoWatch G2 Biographer
Cygnus, Inc., offers the GlucoWatch G2 Biographer, distributed by the Sankyo
Corporation. It is worn like a watch, and glucose readings are taken without
pricking the skin. This device can be set to read as often as every 10 minutes
for up to 13 hours. It works by passing a tiny electric current through the
skin. The current gathers glucose and brings it back to the watch, where it is
measured.
This system is meant to supplement but not replace blood glucose testing by
detecting trends and tracking patterns. It has a built-in alarm that alerts the
wearer if the glucose is too low or too high, based on levels that you set. A
finger stick is still required to calibrate the GlucoWatch at the beginning of
each 13-hour period. After a two hour warm-up period, you calibrate the
meter. The device may not work accurately if it comes in contact with too
much perspiration.
It can store up to 8,500 individual readings. It can sometimes cause irritation
at the site of the device with redness, itching, and blisters.

How I use my patients’ test results
I encourage my patients to keep their own records of their glucose levels so that they can see for
themselves how they are doing. I maintain several years of records and can compare and contrast
results for each patient. I use software to generate pictures of a patient’s diabetic control. The fig-
ures in this sidebar show you graphics that depict test results for a typical patient before starting
therapy and after insulin treatment had time to work. It is easy to see how helpful the graphic infor-
mation can be.
The first figure shows the patient’s blood glucose levels in three different formats. The top, called
the Trendgraph, shows the blood glucoses each day, in this case, between 6/11 and 7/1. The shaded
area represents the blood glucoses from 80 to 180 mg/dl. The line below the shaded area is the 50
mg/dl line. Each X represents a distinct blood glucose test. You can see that the glucose is often
high, going up to 300, and sometimes low, going down to 50 with large excursions. This graph also
shows that the mean of the tests is 159 and that 5 percent of the time, the patient is less than 80;
63.4 percent of the time, she is between 80 and 180; and 31.7 percent of the time, she is above 180.
The next figure, called the Standard Day, puts all those glucose levels in a 24-hour day so that tests
taken between certain hours, regardless of the day, appear close to one another. This grouping
allows me to see whether the patient has a tendency to be high or low at a given time each day.
The software averages out the blood glucose at different times, providing a number to compare 
to other time periods. This information permits me to adjust her insulin to correct for that particu-
lar time.
The bottom figure, called the Pie Chart, clearly shows how much of the time this patient is 
high, how much of the time she is within the target of 80 to 180, and how much of the time she is
below 80.
These three figures provide an excellent picture of the patient’s diabetic control and permit me to
easily compare it to the result of treatment.
As this book was being written, the Animas Corporation, which purchased
Cygnus, decided to discontinue production of the GlucoWatch, but continues
to support it through July 2008.
Guardian RT Glucose Monitoring System
Like the Dexcom described above, this device has a sensor that is inserted
into the skin, a wireless transmitter connected to the sensor and a receiver. It
reads the interstitial fluid glucose every 10 seconds and averages them every
5 minutes. By pushing a button you can see the readings. It holds up to 21
days of data that can be downloaded to a computer. It sounds an alarm to
alert the wearer to high or low glucose levels but significant abnormalities
should always be verified by a finger stick. 

135
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests
The next set of figures represents tests taken after treatment with a new form of insulin, Lantus, for
one week. The results are dramatic. Now almost all the glucoses are in the shaded area, and there
is little excursion of the tests. A few X’s fall above 180, and a few fall below 80. The Standard Day
now shows fairly low averages throughout, except perhaps after lunch. The Pie Chart shows much
more in the target range and far fewer above the target range. Comparing the two graphs, the
above target range area has dropped from 31.7 percent to 6.5 percent.

I can print all these graphs and charts. In later visits, I can compare the current control with the way
the patient was doing before. When patients can see so clearly how they’re improving from time
to time, it keeps them motivated to take their medicine and follow their diet and exercise plan.

Tracking Your Glucose over Time:
Hemoglobin A1c
Individual blood glucose tests are great for deciding how you’re doing at that
moment and what to do to make it better, but they do not give the big pic-
ture. They are just a moment in time. Glucose can change a great deal even in
30 minutes . What you need is a test that gives an integrated picture of many
days, weeks, or even months of blood glucose levels. The test that accom-
plishes this important task is called the hemoglobin A1c. (See the sidebar
“How hemoglobin A1c works” for an explanation of the test’s function.)
Unfortunately, all labs do not do the hemoglobin A1c test the same way. Some
labs report both the hemoglobin A1c and the total glycohemoglobin (the
amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin). As a result, there are different
normal levels depending on how the test was done. You need to know the
normal value in the lab where you do the test. Fortunately, each lab usually
has a column on its result form showing the normal values for each test. Still,
this situation can create confusion.
My medical building has two different labs, each reporting the results differ-
ently. As a result of insurance requirements, I have to send patients to one
lab or the other. When I get back the result, I have to be sure I know which
lab did it. The standard method should be the way it was done in the Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial, the study that showed that controlling the
blood glucose prevents complications in type 1 diabetes. In that study, a normal
level was about 6.05 percent. Figure 7-2 shows you the correlation between the
hemoglobin A1c and the blood glucose when this method is used.
As you can see in the figure, a normal hemoglobin A1c of less than 6 percent
corresponds to a blood glucose of less than 120, while a fair hemoglobin A1c
of 7 percent reflects an average blood glucose of 150.
Large-scale studies have shown that the average hemoglobin A1c in the
United States for type 2 diabetes is around 9.4 percent, which means the
average blood glucose is 220. The American Diabetes Association recom-
mends taking action to control the blood glucose if the hemoglobin A1c is 
8 percent or greater, with the goal being less than 7 percent. The American
Association of Clinical Endocrinologists suggests a goal of 6.5 percent or 
less. While I wish all of my patients would achieve a level of 6.5 percent, I try
to get them as low as possible, but still consistent with a decent quality of
life, which means few to no severe hypoglycemic episodes.
137
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

Your physician should test for hemoglobin A1c as follows:
 Four times a year if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and are on insulin.
 Two times a year if you have type 2 diabetes and are not on insulin.
In my own practice, I test all patients every three months. A good hemoglobin
A1c is highly motivating to keep up good self-care, while a poor result gives
immediate feedback as to the need for tighter control.

How hemoglobin A1c works
Hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen
around the body and drops it off wherever it’s
needed to help in all the chemical reactions 
that are constantly taking place. The hemoglo-
bin is packaged within red blood cells that live in
the bloodstream for 60 to 90 days. As the blood
circulates, glucose in the blood attaches to 
the hemoglobin and stays attached. It attaches
in several different ways to the hemoglobin, 
and the total of all the hemoglobin attached 
to glucose is called glycohemoglobin. Glycohe-
moglobin normally makes up about 6 percent of
the hemoglobin in the blood. The largest frac-
tion, two-thirds of the glycohemoglobin, is in the
form called hemoglobin A1c, making it easiest
to measure. The rest of the hemoglobin is made
up of hemoglobin A1a and A1b. The more glu-
cose in the blood, the more glycohemoglobins
form. Because glycohemoglobin remains in the
blood for two to three months, glycohemoglobin
is a reflection of the glucose control over the
entire time period and not just the second that a
single glucose test reflects.

Currently, the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, created
by the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, is working to get the
hemoglobin A1c test standardized so that a 6 percent result will mean the
same thing for every patient. The program might start by doing only one test,
the hemoglobin A1c, and calling it by only one name.
A company called Metrika, Inc., has come up with a clever home version of
the hemoglobin A1c, called A1c Now. You do a finger stick to produce a large
drop of blood. The blood is mixed with a solution that is provided, and a
sample of that mixture is placed in the testing device. Eight minutes later, the
hemoglobin A1c result appears in the device window. The device is then dis-
carded. The device appears to be highly accurate and may save the trouble
of going to a lab for this test. Because it’s so quick, your doctor can have the
test results while you’re at his office and can act on them immediately,
instead of waiting for a lab to return the test results at a later time. The test
kit is available at pharmacies without a prescription.
Another option is to collect your own blood specimen and send it to a com-
pany that will run the test and give you and your doctor a result. The compa-
nies currently doing this include
 AccuBase A1c Glycohemoglobin (www.diabetestechnologies.com).

Another test similar to the hemoglobin A1c is the fructosamine. This test, which
measures the glucose combined with protein in the blood, reflects the level
139
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

of blood glucose for the past three weeks. Fructosamine is a relatively new
test that has not seen a lot of use, so its place in diabetes care has not been
established. The test should prove very useful for the pregnant woman with
diabetes, for example, where you need to know the effect of a treatment
change very rapidly. As doctors become more familiar with its use, more 
fructosamine tests will be ordered.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a home-testing device
called the Duet Glucose Control Monitoring System, which can measure both
the blood glucose and the fructosamine. The machine costs around $300, and
the test strips are $64 for 8. How useful it will be is yet to be determined.
GlycoMark Test
This test is relatively new in the United States but has been used in Japan for
several years. It differs from the hemoglobin A1c test in two important ways:
 Results take two weeks rather than three months to change.
 Better control is marked by a higher rather than a lower number for the
GlycoMark test.
The test is based on the normal presence of 1.5 anhydroglucitol (1,5 AG) in
the blood. As blood glucose rises and more of it gets into the kidneys, it
blocks the return of 1,5 AG to the blood stream and the measured blood level
of 1,5 AG falls.
Table 7-1 shows the values for GlycoMark in people without diabetes and at
different levels of glucose control.

The GlycoMark test has been shown to be an excellent indicator of the blood
glucose levels, especially after meals, even when the Hemoglobin A1c test
was similar in these patients. It gives the doctor and the patient a much ear-
lier indication of whether therapy is working than does the slow changing
hemoglobin A1c. It will see much more use in the future because it is becom-
ing available in most clinical laboratories and it may soon be available as a
home test.
Testing for Kidney Damage:
Microalbuminuria
The finding of very small but abnormal amounts of protein in the urine,
called microalbuminuria, is the earliest sign that high glucose may be damag-
ing your kidneys (see Chapter 5). When microalbuminuria is found, you still
have time to reverse any damage.
As soon as you are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and within five years of
being diagnosed with type 1, your doctor must order a urine test for microal-
buminuria. If the test is negative, it must be repeated annually. If the test is
positive, it should be done a second time to verify the result. If the second
test is positive, your doctor should do the following:
 Put you on a drug called an ACE inhibitor. After you have been on this
drug for some months, the test for microalbuminuria can be repeated to
see whether it has turned negative. The ACE inhibitor can be stopped
and restarted later if microalbuminuria appears again.
 Bring your blood glucose under the tightest control possible. Bringing
it under control helps to reverse the damaging process as well.
 Normalize your body fats so that your cholesterol and triglycerides
are made normal. Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides have been
found to damage the kidneys. (See the section “Tracking Cholesterol and
Other Fats,” later in this chapter.)
Doing this simple little test can protect your kidneys from damage. Ask your
doctor about it if you think it has never been done. Show him or her this page
if the doctor is unclear as to why it is performed.
Up to 25 percent of patients with diabetes can have ongoing kidney damage
without showing an elevated microalbumin. For this reason, the idea that 
all patients with diabetes should receive an ACE inhibitor may not be 
far-fetched.
141
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

Checking for Eye Problems
All people with diabetes need to have a dilated eye exam done annually 
by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. No other physician, including the
endocrinologist (yours truly excepted, of course), can do the exam properly.
For this exam, the doctor instills drops into your eyes and uses various
instruments to examine the pressure, the appearance of your lens, and, most
importantly, the retina of your eye.
All kinds of treatments can be done if abnormalities are found, but they must
be discovered first. (See Chapter 5 for more information on eye problems.)
This test is something you must demand. Your doctor must refer you to an
ophthalmologist or optometrist every year. Better yet, set up the appoint-
ment yourself with the eye doctor’s nurse at the end of your first visit so that
you are reminded about it each year.
Examining Your Feet
Unfortunately, foot problems often end in amputation. An amputation is
really evidence of inadequate care. (For more on foot problems, see Chapter
5.) The doctor is not necessarily at fault here. The doctor sees you once in a
while. You’re with yourself much more often.
If you have any problem sensing touch with your feet, you need to take the
following precautions:
 You must use your eyes to examine your feet every day.
 You must use your hand to test hot water before you step into it so that
you do not get burned.
 You must shake out your shoes before you step into them to make sure
no stone or other object is inside them.
 You must not go barefoot.
 You must keep the skin of your feet moist by soaking them in water,
drying them, and applying a moisturizing lotion.
Your doctor can test your ability to feel an injury by using a 10-gram filament,
but, again, that is done only when you have an appointment. You can obtain
one of these filaments for yourself. A couple of the places where you can get
them include
142
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

 Center For Specialized Diabetes Foot Care at www.middelta.com/
filamentsinfo.htm.
 Diabetic Care Services at www.diabeticcareservices.com under
Neuropathy Testing.
 Sensory Testing Systems at www.thetrophyhousebr.com. Click on
STS products.
If you have any suggestion of a loss of sensation, at each visit to the doctor
who takes care of your diabetes, you should take off your shoes and socks
and have your feet inspected by the doctor.
The other part of a foot examination involves checking the circulation of
blood to your feet. To check the cirulation, your doctor does a measurement
called an ankle-brachial index at least once every five years. The systolic
blood pressure is measured in the ankle and the arm. (See the sidebar “The
meaning of your blood pressure,” later in this chapter, for an explanation of
systolic blood pressure.) The value for the ankle is divided by the value for
the arm. An index of greater than 0.9 is considered normal. A value between
0.4 and 0.9 indicates peripheral vascular disease (see Chapter 5), while a
value less than 0.4 indicates severe disease.
The ankle-brachial index should be done for any person with diabetes over
age 50. Patients under 50 require the study if risk factors such as smoking,
high cholesterol, and high blood pressure are present.
Tracking Cholesterol and Other Fats
Most people these days know the level of their total cholesterol, but 
other tests that show levels of various types of fats in the blood are needed
as well.
Cholesterol is a type of fat that circulates in the blood in small packages
called lipoproteins. These tiny round particles contain fat (lipo, as in liposuc-
tion) and protein. Because cholesterol does not dissolve in water, it would
separate from the blood if it were not surrounded by the protein, just like oil
separates from water in salad dressing. (That’s why you have to shake the
salad dressing each time you use it.)
A second kind of fat found in the lipoproteins is triglyceride. Triglyceride actu-
ally represents the form of most of the fat you eat each day. Although you
may eat only a gram or less of cholesterol (an egg yolk has one-third of a
gram of cholesterol), you eat up to 100 grams of triglyceride a day. (For more
on the place of fats in your diet, see Chapter 8.) The fat in animal meats is
mostly triglycerides.
143
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

Four types of lipoproteins exist:
 Chylomicrons, the largest fat particles, contain the fat that is absorbed
from the intestine after a meal. They are usually cleared from the blood
rapidly. Ordinarily, chylomicrons are not a concern with respect to caus-
ing arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).
 Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) particles contain mostly triglyc-
eride as the fat. These particles are smaller than chylomicrons.
 High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), known as “good” cholesterol, is the
next smallest in size. This particle functions to clean the arteries, help-
ing to prevent coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and
strokes.
 Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), known as “bad” cholesterol, is the parti-
cle that seems to carry cholesterol to the arteries, where it’s deposited
and causes hardening of the arteries.-
As you might imagine, we need to know which particle your cholesterol
comes from in order to understand whether you have too much bad choles-
terol (LDL) or a satisfactory level of good cholesterol (HDL).
You do not have to fast to do a test for total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.
However, you do need to fast for eight hours to find out your LDL cholesterol,
because the blood has to be cleared of chylomicrons, which rise greatly
when you eat.
You should have a fasting lipid panel at least once each year. A fasting lipid
panel gives you your total cholesterol, your LDL cholesterol, your HDL 
cholesterol, and your triglyceride levels.
Table 7-2 lists the current recommendations for the levels of these fats in
terms of the risk for coronary artery disease.
Table 7-2
Levels of Fat and the Risk for Coronary Artery Disease

35 to 45
200 to 399

You can see from Table 7-1 that the risk goes up as the LDL cholesterol goes
up and the HDL cholesterol goes down. A huge study of thousands of citizens
of Framingham, Massachusetts, shows that you can get a good picture of the
144
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

risk by dividing the total cholesterol by the HDL cholesterol. If this result is
less than 4.5, the risk is lower. If it’s greater than 4.5, you’re at higher risk for
coronary artery disease. The higher it is, the worse the risk.
In March 2004, the story got a little more complicated. The New England
Journal of Medicine published results of a study of more than 4,000 men who
had just had heart attacks. In the study, some patients’ LDL cholesterol was
reduced maximally (to a mean of 62) with a large dose of a powerful drug
called atorvastatin. The result was a major reduction, starting in just 30 days
after treatment with the drug, in subsequent heart attacks, chest pain, and
strokes compared to a group whose LDL was lowered only to 95. This result
calls for a major reappraisal of “normal” for LDL. It may be that the lowest
possible LDL level is best and that this applies to everyone, not only people
who have just had a heart attack.
Diabetes adds its own complication because of the metabolic syndrome (see
Chapter 5). In the metabolic syndrome, the total cholesterol may not be very
high, but the HDL cholesterol is low and the triglycerides are elevated. These
patients also have a lot of a dangerous form of LDL cholesterol, so they are at
higher risk for coronary artery disease. This increased risk must be taken
into account in considering treatment for the fats.
In deciding whether and how to treat the fats, you have to consider other risk
factors for coronary artery disease. You’re at
 Highest risk if you already have coronary artery disease, stroke, or
peripheral vascular disease.
 High risk if you
• Are a male over 45.
• Are a female over 55.
• Smoke cigarettes.
• Have high blood pressure.
• Have HDL cholesterol less than 35.
• Have a father or brother who had a heart attack before age 55.
• Have a mother or sister who had a heart attack before age 65.
• Have a body mass index greater than 30.
 Low risk if you have none of the preceding risk factors.
The treatment for abnormal fats then depends on your risk category and
level of LDL cholesterol (see Table 7-3).

All these decisions depend on obtaining a lipid (fat) panel.
These treatment guidelines will change as the experts have a chance to 
evaluate the LDL study of heart attack victims that I discuss in this section.
Measuring Blood Pressure
The United States is experiencing an epidemic of high blood pressure 
(hypertension) similar to the epidemic of diabetes. The reasons are the same:
 Americans are getting fatter.
 Americans are storing fat in the center of our bodies, the so-called
abdominal visceral fat.
 Americans are getting older as a population. The fastest growing seg-
ment of the population is over 75 years of age. Of people age 50 to 55
with diabetes, 50 percent have high blood pressure. Of people older
than 75 with diabetes, 75 percent have high blood pressure.
 Americans are more sedentary than before.
People with diabetes have high blood pressure more often than the nondia-
betic population for a lot of other reasons besides the preceding ones:
 People with diabetes get kidney disease.
 People with diabetes have increased sensitivity to salt, which raises
blood pressure.
 People with diabetes lack the nighttime fall in blood pressure that 
normally occurs in people without diabetes.
Doctors generally agree that a normal blood pressure is less than 140/90. For
years, the diastolic blood pressure (the lower reading) was considered more
damaging, and an elevation in that pressure was treated with greater impor-
tance than an elevation in the systolic blood pressure (the higher reading).
Recent studies have shown that the systolic blood pressure, not the diastolic
146
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

blood pressure, may be more important. (See the sidebar “The meaning of
your blood pressure” for more detailed explanations of each type of blood
pressure.)
All the complications of diabetes are made worse by an elevation in blood
pressure, especially diabetic kidney disease but also eye disease, heart 
disease, nerve disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebral arterial 
disease (see Chapter 5).
The most recent evidence of the importance of controlling blood pressure in
diabetes comes from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, pub-
lished in late 1998. This study found that a lowering of blood pressure by 10
mm systolic and 5 mm diastolic resulted in a 24 percent reduction in any dia-
betic complication and a 32 percent reduction in death related to diabetes.
Controlling the blood pressure is absolutely essential in diabetes. The goal in
diabetes is an even lower blood pressure than in the person without diabetes
because studies have shown that lower normal blood pressures result in less
diabetic damage than higher normal blood pressures. Your blood pressure
should be no higher than 130/80.
How well are doctors doing at controlling blood pressure in people with dia-
betes? A study has shown that only 15 percent of people with diabetes with
hypertension have a blood pressure as low as 140/90, and only 5 percent
have a blood pressure down to 130/80.
Your doctor should measure blood pressure at every visit. Better yet, get a
blood pressure device and measure it yourself. If you detect an elevation,
bring it to the attention of your doctor.
For much more information on every aspect of high blood pressure, see my
book High Blood Pressure For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley).
Checking Your Weight and BMI
To give you a general idea of how much you ought to weigh, you can use the
following formula:
 If you’re a woman, give yourself 100 pounds for being 5 feet tall and add
5 pounds for each inch over 5 feet. For example, if you’re 5 feet 3 inches,
your appropriate weight should be approximately 115 pounds.
 If you’re a man, give yourself 106 pounds for being 5 feet tall and add 6
pounds for each inch over 5 feet. A 5-foot 6-inch male should weigh
around 142 pounds.
147
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement that relates weight to height. A tall
person has a lower BMI than a short person of the same weight. (See Chapter
3 for more on BMI, including instructions for calculating your own BMI.) A
person with a BMI under 18.5 is considered slim. A person with a BMI from
18.5 to 24.9 is normal. A person with a BMI from 25 to 29.9 is overweight, and
a person with a BMI of 30 or over is obese. By this definition, more than half
the people in the United States are overweight or obese.
You cannot step on a scale and get a reading of your BMI, but you can get
your weight. This measurement is one of the easiest in medicine. Your doctor
should measure your weight at every visit.
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute makes it easy for you to know
your BMI. Just fill in your weight in pounds and your height in feel and
inches, click on compute BMI and you have your result. You can find it on 
the Internet at http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/.
Maintaining a BMI in the normal range makes controlling your diabetes and
blood pressure easier. Also, you must eliminate obesity as a risk factor for
coronary artery disease.
148
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 
The meaning of your blood pressure
What does the blood pressure measurement
mean, and what is high blood pressure? When
you get a reading, it usually looks something like
120/70 — it has an upper reading and a lower
reading.
 The upper reading, called the systolic pres-
sure, is the amount of force exerted by the
heart when it contracts to push blood around
the body. A cuff around your arm connects
to a column of mercury. You, your doctor, or
a machine listens for the first sound you hear
on the side of the cuff away from your heart.
That sound is the sound of blood finally able
to overcome the pressure in the cuff and get
through to the other side. The systolic blood
pressure is the height of the column of 
mercury, read in millimeters, just as the
blood comes through. (Sometimes the cuff is
not connected to a column of mercury but to
a gauge that is calibrated so the reading on
the gauge is in millimeters of mercury even
though no mercury is present.) In our exam-
ple, the systolic blood pressure reading is
120 mm of mercury.
 The lower reading, called the diastolic blood
pressure, is the pressure in the artery when
the heart is at rest. A valve in the heart
keeps the blood from flowing backwards so
that the pressure does not fall to zero (you
hope). When the sound stops, the height of
the mercury column gives the diastolic blood
pressure, in this case 70 mm of mercury.

Testing for Ketones
When your blood glucose rises above 250 mg/dl (13.9 mmol/L), or if you 
are pregnant with diabetes and your blood glucose is below 60 mg/dl (3.3
mmol/L), it is a good idea to check for ketones — products of the breakdown
of fats. Finding ketones means that your body has turned to fat for energy. If
you have high glucose and find ketones, you may need more insulin. If you
have low glucose and find ketones during pregnancy, you may need more 
carbohydrates in your diet.
Testing for ketones is done by inserting a test strip into your urine and
observing a purple color. The deeper the color, the greater the ketone level. If
you find a large amount of ketones, you should contact your physician.
Even better you can use a meter such as the Precision Xtra described earlier
to do a blood ketone level.
Testing the C-reactive Protein
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a substance in the blood that is produced by the
liver when there is infection or inflammation. It can be measured with a
simple blood test. Diabetes is associated with several features that suggest
that inflammation plays an important role in the disease. People who develop
diabetes have higher C-reactive protein than those who don’t. (Other 
substances associated with inflammation are also elevated in diabetes.)
Drugs that improve diabetes lower the amount of C-reactive protein, which is
also considered a marker for coronary artery disease.
Have your C-reactive protein measured with other blood tests about once a
year. If the level is elevated, it may serve as a predictor of future diabetes or
coronary artery disease. About 90 percent of healthy individuals have CRP
levels less than 3, and 99 percent have levels less than 10.
Checking the TSH
Because there is a higher incidence of thyroid disease among people with 
diabetes and because thyroid disease is often confused with other condi-
tions, a screening test called the thyroid stimulating hormone level is done 
at the time that diabetes is diagnosed and every five years thereafter if it 
is normal.
149
Chapter 7: Glucose Monitoring and Other Tests

TSH is produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. When the thyroid gland
makes the right amount of thyroid hormone, the pituitary produces the right
amount of TSH to keep it working properly. The normal level in the blood is
0.5-2.5 microunits per milliliter (mU/ml). 
When the thyroid makes inadequate amounts of thyroid hormone, the pitu-
itary increases its production of TSH to stimulate the thyroid and values of 
10 or more mU/ml are not uncommon. When the thyroid makes too much 
thyroid hormone, it causes the pituitary to turn down its production of TSH
and values less than 0.5 mU/ml are found.
Too much thyroid hormone leads to insulin resistance, making diabetes
worse than before. Too little thyroid hormone increases insulin sensitivity so
people with low thyroid function have reduced levels of blood glucose.
Much more about thyroid disease and its treatment can be found in my book
Thyroid For Dummies, 2nd Edition.

oy, are we big and getting bigger! You would think we were all on
steroids. No, that explains professional baseball and football but not 
us nonprofessionals. The Centers for Disease Control tells us that more than
six in ten Americans are overweight or obese. Most adults are 25 pounds
heavier than people in the 1960s. And yet more than half of these overweight
people think they are at a healthy weight. Something has got to give.
Language specialists claim that the five sweetest phrases in the English 
language are
 I love you.
 Dinner is served.
 All is forgiven.
 Sleep until noon.
 Keep the change.
To that, most people would certainly add, “You’ve lost weight.”
For the diabetic population, most of whom are overweight, appropriate nutri-
tion and weight loss are not an option but a necessity. The Diabetes Control
and Complications Trial clearly demonstrated that a person with diabetes

who follows a careful nutrition program can reduce his or her hemoglobin
A1c (see Chapter 7) by as much as 1 percent compared to the person with
diabetes who is careless about diet. The consequence of that lowering is 
a very significant reduction in both short- and long-term complications of 
diabetes.
In this chapter, you will find out all you need to know to make your diet work
for you, not only to improve your diabetes and control your blood glucose,
but generally to feel that you have an improved quality of life.
Considering Total Calories First
Wanda B. Thinner, age 46, was a new type 2 diabetic patient who came to me
because of high blood glucose levels, some blurring of her vision, and some
numbness in her toes. She was 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 165 pounds.
She was taking pills for the diabetes, but they were not helping. Her doctor
had told her she needed to lose weight but gave no further instructions. I
started her on a diet based on the principles in this chapter. She was willing
to follow the diet and lost 20 pounds, which she has kept off. Her blood glu-
cose is now in the range of 110 most of the time. She no longer suffers from
blurred vision, and her toes are beginning to improve. She is not taking the
diabetes medication and feels much better.
No matter how you slice it, your weight is determined by the number of calo-
ries you take in, minus the number of calories you use up by exercise or loss
of calories in the urine or bowel movements. If you have an excess of calories
coming in and have insulin with which to store them, you gain weight. If you
have fewer calories in than out, you lose weight. (See Chapter 7 if you’re not
sure how much you should weigh.) If you are overweight, you will benefit
from even a small weight loss:
 Weight loss markedly reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
 Weight loss prevents the progression of prediabetes (see Chapter 2) into
type 2 diabetes.
 Weight loss can reverse the failure to respond to drugs for diabetes that
develops after responding at first (see Chapter 10).
 Weight loss reduces the risk of death from diabetes.
 Weight loss increases life expectancy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
 Weight loss has beneficial effects on high blood pressure and abnormal
fats (see Chapter 7).
In an article in the International Journal of Obesity in June 2006, the authors
from the University of Alabama and the University of Wisconsin offered ten
other reasons that may be playing a role in our obesity epidemic. They are
152
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

worth noting and considering for the possible role they play in your over-
weight condition:
 Reduced length of nightly sleep: There is an inverse relationship
between weight and hours of sleep. People are sleeping less than they
did before.
 Hormones and other substances in food: Substances like estrogens,
which are put in animal feed to fatten the animals, do the same to the
humans who eat those animals.
 Decreased exposure to high and low temperatures: High temperatures
cause sweating and low temperatures cause shivering, both of which
contribute to weight loss. Modern heat and air conditioning diminish
our exposure to extremes of temperature, which is actually good for us.
 Decreased smoking: This is a good news, bad news phenomenon.
Obviously cigarette smoking is the greatest public health menace that
exists, but smokers do tend to be leaner than non-smokers.
 Use of drugs that cause weight gain: Many of the drugs used for mental
states like depression and high blood pressure cause marked weight
gain and even diabetes.
 Increases in age and ethnic groups that tend to be more overweight or
obese: Hispanic Americans, who are increasing in the population, have a
much higher obesity prevalence than Caucasians. At the same time, the
general population is older.
 Increasing age of new mothers: Older mothers tend to produce more
obese children.
 Effects in the uterus: Maternal obesity may cause changes in the grow-
ing fetus that promote obesity.
 Heavier women have more offspring: These offspring, in turn, tend to
be heavier.
 Humans tend to choose heavier mates: Heavier mates have reproduc-
tive advantages.
One or several of these explanations may play a small role in your overweight
condition, and several may interact, but the overall effect is a significant
increase in weight.
Portion sizes have increased significantly both in restaurants and at home.
Here are correct portion sizes for several foods:
 Three ounces of meat is the size of a deck of playing cards.
 A medium apple or peach is the size of a tennis ball.
 One ounce of cheese is the size of four dice.
 One-half cup of ice cream is the size of a tennis ball.
153
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

 A cup of mashed potatoes is the size of your fist.
 A teaspoon of butter or peanut butter is the size of the tip of your
thumb.
 One-half cup of nuts is the size of a golf ball.
The reason the French, with their much richer diet, may be leaner than us is
that they eat significantly smaller portions.
To have an approximate idea of how many kcalories (kilocalories) you need
each day (not calories, which are much smaller), you need to figure your
desirable weight. Using the method describe in Chapter 7, a 5-foot 6-inch
male with a moderate frame should weigh around 142 pounds. To find the
number of kcalories needed:
1. Multiply your weight times 10. In our example, this gives a value of
about 1,400 kcalories.
2. Add kcalories for your level of exercise:
• A sedentary male adds 10 percent of the basal kcalories.
• A moderately active male adds 20 percent.
• A very active male adds 40 percent or more, depending on the
length and the degree of exercise.
If the male in our example is moderately active, he needs 1,400 kcalories plus
1,400 times 20 percent (or about 300) more for a total of 1,700 kcalories.
These formulas are true for women as well, but women usually require fewer
calories to maintain the same weight as men. Be aware that this is an approxi-
mation that differs not only for different people but even for the same person
on different days.
Caloric needs are different for people of different ages and different levels of
activity. A woman that is pregnant or breastfeeding obviously needs more
kcalories. If a person is trying to lose weight, reducing the total kcalories per
day can help to accomplish this. I say a lot more about this in the section on
weight reduction in this chapter.
After you’ve calculated your kcalorie needs, you need to try a diet based on
those needs, and you need to be willing to modify that diet if you don’t have
enough energy or aren’t maintaining your desired weight. Especially if you
are very physically active, your extra caloric needs may be very large and
will quickly be noticed because you will lose weight.
When you determine the total kcalories you need, the question becomes how
to divide the calories among various foods. Basically, three types of foods
contain calories: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Within these foods, you
have many variables, which I explain in the following sections.
154
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Carbohydrates
There is no more controversial area in nutrition for the diabetic person 
than carbohydrates. For years, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 
told people with diabetes that they should eat 55 to 60 percent of their 
calories as carbohydrate. Other experts said that amount was too much or
too little. The ADA has now modified its recommendation so that it says in
the Clinical Practice Recommendations for 2007: “The recommended daily
allowance for carbohydrate (130 grams per day) in diabetes management is
an average minimum requirement.”
In this section, I give you my suggestions for carbohydrate in your diet based
on my reading of the medical literature and my clinical experience. You are
free to disagree with me and use whatever level of carbohydrate you like as
long as it helps to promote a lower blood glucose without increasing your
blood fats or weight.
Carbohydrates are the sources of energy that start with glucose, the sugar in
your bloodstream that is one sugar molecule, and include substances con-
taining many sugar molecules called complex carbohydrates, starches, cellu-
lose, and gums. Some of the common sources of carbohydrate are bread,
potatoes, grains, cereals, and rice.
Physicians know a lot of information about carbohydrate in the body:
 Carbohydrate is the primary source of energy for muscles.
 Glucose is the carbohydrate that causes the pancreas to release insulin.
 Carbohydrate causes the triglyceride (fat) level to rise in the blood.
 When insulin is not present or is ineffective, more carbohydrate raises
the blood glucose higher.
 If simple sugars are in the diet in increased amounts, they are not harm-
ful as long as the total calorie count is satisfactory. (The major reason to
reduce simple sugars in the diet is the harmful effect on dental cavities.
Cavities are no more severe or common in people with diabetes than in
people without diabetes.)
Although the fat intake of the U.S. population has declined because of the
fear of coronary artery disease caused by cholesterol, Americans are getting
fatter. In fact, 64 percent of Americans are considered overweight or obese
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources. Because
Americans are not eating more protein, the culprit is most likely excess car-
bohydrate, such as that found in concentrated sweets, such as pastry and
candy, as well as the more complex carbohydrate found in bread. Within the
body, carbohydrate can be turned into fat and stored. This function was great
when everyone lived in caves and got little food for prolonged periods of
time, but it doesn’t fit today’s lifestyle, consisting as it does of abundant food
(and minimal foraging for it in the supermarket).
155
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

Because carbohydrate is the food that raises the blood glucose, which is
responsible for the complications of diabetes, it seems right to recommend a
diet that is lower in carbohydrate than previously suggested. Furthermore, 
a major source of coronary artery disease in diabetes is the metabolic syn-
drome (see Chapter 5). Because increased carbohydrate triggers increased
triglyceride, which is the beginning of a number of abnormalities that lead to
increased coronary artery disease, recommending less carbohydrate on this
basis as well seems prudent.
My experience has been that a diet of between 40 and 50 percent carbohy-
drate makes controlling my patients’ blood glucose much easier. It also leads
to weight loss because you don’t tend to substitute protein or fat for the
reduced amount of carbohydrate in the diet. My patients on lower carbohy-
drate diets are able to reduce the amounts of drugs they take, such as insulin,
which can cause weight gain and complicate controlling their diabetes. They
also have a better fat profile.
Thinking back to our example earlier in this chapter, a man on a diet of 
1,700 kcalories should eat about 680 kcalories as carbohydrate. Because 
each gram of carbohydrate is 4 kcalories, he eats about 170 to 210 grams of
carbohydrate a day. This is higher than the minimum recommended above.
Translating this into the foods you know and love, this is the same as 13 to 
16 slices of whole wheat bread, to 7 cups of oatmeal cereal, or 3 to 4 cups of
brown rice a day.
Glycemic index
All carbohydrates are not alike in the degree to which they raise the blood
glucose. This fact was recognized some years ago, and a measurement called
the glycemic index was created to quantify it. The glycemic index (GI) uses
white bread as the indicator food and assigns it a value of 100. Another car-
bohydrate of equal calories is compared to white bread in its ability to raise
the blood glucose and is assigned a value in comparison to white bread. A
food that raises glucose half as much as white bread has a GI of 50, while a
food that raises glucose 11⁄2 times as much has a GI of 150.
A recent study reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine in November
2007 showed that in a group of Chinese women who tended to eat a lot of
high glycemic index rice, there was a significant increase in the risk of devel-
oping type 2 diabetes. Another study in the same issue showed that increas-
ing the level of low glycemic cereal in the diet reduced the risk of type 2
diabetes in a group of black women, a group that is getting type 2 diabetes in
epidemic numbers.
The point is to select carbohydrates with low GI levels to try to keep the 
glucose response as low as possible. A glycemic index of 70 or more is high;
56 to 69 is medium; and 55 or less is low.
The following complications have caused the GI to be underutilized:
156
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

 The GI of a carbohydrate may be different when it is eaten alone or as
part of a mixed meal.
 The GI of a food may differ if it’s processed and prepared differently.
 Some low GI foods, like chocolate, contain a lot of fat.
 Diabetes educators have been reluctant to teach the concept of the
glycemic index because they believe it is hard to understand and will
create confusion.
However, good clinical studies have shown that knowledge of the glycemic
index of food sources can be very valuable. Evaluation of the diet of people
who develop diabetes compared with those who don’t shows that, all other
things being equal, the people with the highest GI diet most often develop
diabetes. After diabetes is present, those who eat the lowest GI carbohy-
drates have the lowest levels of blood glucose. Patients in these studies have
not had great difficulty changing to a low GI diet. The other thing that hap-
pens when low GI food is incorporated into a diet is that the levels of triglyc-
erides and LDL (or “bad” cholesterol) fall in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
I believe that switching to low GI carbohydrates can be very beneficial for
controlling the glucose. You can easily make some simple substitutions in
your diet, as shown in Table 8-1.
Table 8-1
Simple Diet Substitutions
High-GI Food
Low-GI Food
Whole meal or white bread
Whole grain bread
Processed breakfast cereal
Unrefined cereals like oats or processed low GI
cereals
Plain cookies and crackers
Cookies made with dried fruits or whole grains
like oats
Cakes and muffins
Cakes and muffins made with fruit, oats, and
whole grains
Tropical fruits like bananas
Temperate climate fruits like apples and plums
Potatoes
Pasta or legumes
Rice
Basmati or other low GI rice
Because bread and breakfast cereals are major daily sources of carbohy-
drates, these simple changes can make a major difference in lowering your
glycemic index. Foods that are excellent sources of carbohydrate but have 
a low GI include legumes such as peas or beans, pasta, grains like barley, 
parboiled rice and bulgar, and whole grain breads.
157
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

Even though a food has a low GI, it may not be appropriate because it is too
high in fat. You need to evaluate each food’s fat content before assuming that
all low GI foods are good for a person with diabetes. 
The position of the American Diabetes Association, stated in their position
statement in 2007, is that “the use of the glycemic index may provide a
modest additional benefit over that observed when total carbohydrate is
considered.”
And though a food has a high GI, it may still be acceptable in your diet if
there is very little total carbohydrate. For example, cantaloupe has a GI of
about 70, but the amount of total carbohydrate is so low that it does not raise
your blood glucose significantly when you eat a normal portion. This concept
is called the glycemic load (GL), a number that takes both glycemic index and
total carbohydrates into account. A GL of 20 is high; 11 to 19 is medium; and
10 or less is low.
If you want to go into this subject in deeper detail, you can find a listing of
many foods by category of food and by level of GI, portion size, and GL on
the Web at http://www.glycemicindex.com/.
Fiber
Fiber is the part of the carbohydrate that is not digestible and, therefore,
adds no calories. Fiber is found in most fruits, grains, and vegetables. Fiber
comes in two forms:
 Soluble fiber: This form of fiber can dissolve in water and has a lower-
ing effect on blood glucose and fat levels, particularly cholesterol.
 Insoluble fiber: This form of fiber cannot dissolve in water and remains
in the intestine. It absorbs water and stimulates movement in the intes-
tine. Insoluble fiber also helps prevent constipation and possibly colon
cancer. This is the fiber called bulk or roughage.
Before the current trend to refine foods, people ate many sources of carbohy-
drate that were high in fiber. These were all in plant foods, such as fruits, 
vegetables, and grains. Animal foods contain no fiber.
Because too much fiber causes diarrhea and gas, you need to increase the
fiber level in your diet fairly slowly. The recommendation for daily fiber is 20
to 30 grams. Most Americans eat only about 15 grams daily.
Many of the foods listed in the previous section as having a low glycemic
index contain a lot of fiber, which helps to reduce the blood glucose.
The way to eat the right amount of carbohydrate without increasing your
blood glucose or triglycerides is to make it a low-glycemic, high-fiber 
carbohydrate.
158
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Proteins
Excluding vegetable sources of protein like soybeans, legumes, nuts, and
seeds, protein in your diet is usually the muscle of other animals, such as
chicken, turkey, beef, or lamb. For this reason, people used to believe that
you could build your own muscle by eating lots of another animals’ muscle.
(The truth is that you can build up your muscle only by exercising or
weightlifting.) You need little protein to maintain your current level of muscle
or increase it for that matter.
Your choice of protein is very important because some is very high in fat
while some is relatively fat-free. The following lists can give you an idea of the
fat content of various sources of protein. (In the next section, I explain how to
integrate fat into your diet.)
One ounce of very lean meat, fish, or substitutes has 7 grams of protein and
1 gram of fat. Examples include
 Skinless white meat chicken or turkey
 Flounder, halibut, or tuna canned in water
 Lobster, shrimp, or clams
 Fat-free cheese
An ounce of lean meat, fish, or substitutes has 7 grams of protein and 3
grams of fat. Examples include
 Lean beef, lean pork, lamb, or veal
 Dark meat chicken without skin or white meat chicken with skin
 Sardines, salmon, or tuna canned in oil
 Other meats or cheeses with 3 grams of fat per ounce
An ounce of medium-fat meat, fish, or substitutes has 7 grams of protein plus
5 grams of fat. Examples include
 Most beef products
 Regular fat pork, lamb, or veal
 Dark meat chicken with skin or fried chicken
 Fried fish
 Cheeses with 5 grams of fat per ounce, such as feta and mozzarella
High fat meat, fish, or substitutes contain 8 grams of fat and 7 grams of 
protein per ounce. Examples include
159
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

 Pork spareribs or pork sausage
 Bacon
 Regular cheeses like Cheddar and Monterey Jack
 Processed sandwich meats
You can see that there is a huge difference in kcalories between low-fat
sources of protein and high-fat sources. An ounce of skinless white meat
chicken contains about 40 kcalories, while an ounce of pork spareribs has
100 kcalories. Because most people eat a minimum of four ounces of meat at
a meal, they’re eating from 160 to 400 kcalories depending upon the source.
My recommendation is that 20 percent of your kcalories come from protein.
This would be about 350 kcalories for the gentleman who weighs 142 pounds
and needs 1,700 kcalories each day. Because a gram of protein is 4 kcalories,
he can eat 90 grams of protein. Translating that into ounces of meat, because
there are 7 grams of protein in each ounce, he can eat about 13 ounces of
meat daily. For example, he can eat 6 ounces of flounder at one meal and 5
ounces of dark meat chicken at another, with 2 glasses of milk providing the
rest of his protein.
Many authorities suggest less protein in the diet because protein has a dam-
aging effect on the kidneys. Several studies have shown this to be the case,
but a very large study in the Annals of Internal Medicine in March 2003 came
to a different conclusion. It showed that high-protein diets caused increasing
damage in kidneys that already had some damage but not in normal kidneys.
The jury remains out on this question of lower versus higher protein diets.
Fats
The amount of fat you need is a lot less controversial than the carbohydrate
and protein in your diet. Everyone agrees that you should eat no more than
30 percent of your diet as fats. (Currently, the U.S. population eats 36 percent
of its diet as fats.)
Keep in mind that some fats are more dangerous in their tendency to pro-
mote coronary artery disease than others. These fats should make up less 
of the dietary fat than the safer fats.
Cholesterol is the fat everyone knows. It has been shown to be the culprit in
the development of coronary artery disease, as well as peripheral vascular
disease and cerebrovascular disease (see Chapter 5). The recommendation is
that no more than 300 milligrams a day of fat come from cholesterol. One egg
can take care of that prescription. Most other foods that you eat regularly do
not contain a lot of cholesterol, but whole milk and hard cheeses like Jack
and Cheddar contain saturated fat, which raises the cholesterol in the body.
160
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

The other kind of fat is triglyceride, which comes in several forms:
 Saturated fat is the kind of fat that usually comes from animal sources.
The streaks of fat in a steak are saturated fat. Butter is made up of satu-
rated fat. Bacon, cream, and cream cheese are other examples. Vegetable
sources of saturated fat include coconut, palm, and palm kernel oils.
Eating a lot of saturated fat increases your blood cholesterol level.
 Trans fatty acid is produced when polyunsaturated fat (which I describe
in the next bullet) is heated and hydrogen is bubbled through it. Fully
hydrogenated, it becomes solid fat; partially hydrogenated, it has a con-
sistency like butter and can be used in butter’s place. Food manufactur-
ers have used trans fatty acids to replace butter because trans fatty
acids are cheaper.
Trans fatty acids may contribute more to the development of heart dis-
ease than saturated fats. Keep them out of your diet! Some examples of
foods high in trans fats are margarines, some cake mixes and dried soup
mixes, many fast foods and frozen foods, baked goods like donuts and
cookies, potato chips, crackers, breakfast cereals (even some with seem-
ingly health-conscious names), candies, and whipped toppings. The gov-
ernment now requires food labels to list trans fats, so read those labels!
 Unsaturated fat comes from vegetable sources like olive oil, canola oil,
and margarine. It comes in several forms:
• Monounsaturated fat does not raise cholesterol. Avocado, olive
oil, and canola oil are examples. The oil in nuts like almonds and
peanuts is monounsaturated.
• Polyunsaturated fat also does not raise cholesterol but causes a
reduction in the good or HDL cholesterol. Examples of polyunsatu-
rated fats are soft fats and oils such as corn oil, mayonnaise, and
margarine.
Eskimos eat a lot of fat (more than is recommended), and yet they have a low
incidence of coronary artery disease. It has been shown that their protection
comes from essential fatty acids. These acids are found in fish oils, which the
Eskimos consume to a great extent. Essential fatty acids reduce triglycerides,
reduce blood pressure, and increase the time that it takes for blood to clot,
which protects against a blood clot in the heart. You can have the benefits of
fish oil by substituting fish for meat two or three times a week in your diet.
Pills containing fish oil have not been shown to provide the same benefit. If
you don’t like fish (which means you have probably never tasted salmon
cooked on a barbecue), you can’t get this benefit.
Keeping in mind that 30 percent of your total daily calories should come from
fat, less than a third of that amount should come from saturated fats. You
should also keep your dietary cholesterol under 300 milligrams per day.
161
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

For the gentleman who weighs 142 pounds and needs 1,700 kcalories, who is
slowly starving waiting for us to figure out how much to feed him, his final
500 kcalories can come from fat. Fat has 9 kcalories per gram, so he can eat
about 56 grams of fat daily.
Remember that he has already taken in 40 grams of fat with his flounder and
chicken, so he is left with only 16 grams, 8 of which come with his milk. That
leaves about a teaspoon of butter from the fat sources.
Getting Enough Vitamins, 
Minerals, and Water
Your diet must contain sufficient vitamins and minerals, but the amount you
need may be less than you think. If you eat a balanced diet that comes from
the various food groups, you generally get enough vitamins for your daily
needs. Table 8-2 lists the vitamins and their food sources.

As you look through the vitamins in Table 8-2, you can see that most of them
are easily available in the foods you eat every day. In certain situations, such
as if you are pregnant, you need to be sure that you are getting enough every
day, so you take a vitamin supplement. Some evidence also suggests that
extra vitamin C protects against colds.
As far as the other vitamins go, the proof just does not exist that large
amounts of the vitamins are beneficial, and in some cases, they may be 
harmful. I do not recommend that you take megadoses of these vitamins.
Minerals are also key ingredients of a healthy diet. Most are needed in tiny
amounts, which are easily consumed from a balanced diet. Keep the following
in mind:
 Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium build bones and teeth. Milk 
and other dairy products provide plenty of these minerals, but evidence
suggests that people are not getting enough calcium. Adults should get
1,000 milligrams of calcium every day, and you should get 1,500 mil-
ligrams if you are growing up (adolescents) or out (pregnant women).
Older people must be sure to eat 1,500 milligrams a day. Increased 
magnesium in the diet has a protective role in the development of type 
2 diabetes.
 Iron is essential for red blood cells and is gotten from meat. However,
a menstruating woman tends to lose iron and may need to supplement
her food with a pill.
 Sodium regulates body water. You need only about 220 milligrams a
day, but you likely take in 20 to 40 times that much, which probably
explains a lot of the high blood pressure in the United States. Don’t add
salt to your food because it already has plenty in it, and you will enjoy
the taste a lot more without it.
 Chromium is needed in tiny amounts. No scientific evidence shows
that chromium is especially helpful to the person with diabetes in 
controlling the blood glucose despite reams of articles in health food
magazines to the contrary.
163
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

 Iodine is essential for production of thyroid hormones. It is added to
salt in order to assure that people get enough of it. In many areas of the
world where iodine is not found in the soil, people suffer from very large
thyroid glands known as goiters.
 Various other minerals, like chlorine, cobalt, tin, and zinc, are found
in many foods. These minerals are rarely lacking in the human diet.
Water is the last important nutrient I discuss in this section, but it is by no
means the least important. Your body is made up of 60 percent or more
water. All the nutrients in the body are dissolved in water. You can live with-
out food for some time, but you will not last long without water. Water can
help to give a feeling of fullness that reduces appetite. In general, people do
not drink enough water. You need to drink a minimum of 10 cups, or 21⁄2
quarts, of water a day.
Counting Alcohol as Part of Your Diet
Alcohol is a chemical that has calories but no particular nutritional value;
although it has been shown that a moderate amount (a glass or two of wine a
day) may reduce the risk of a heart attack. Notice that I call alcohol a chemi-
cal. That’s because alcohol is often taken to excess and does major damage
to the body. It wrecks the liver and can lead to bleeding and death.
This book is not the place for a discussion of the social issues that surround
the use of alcohol. Suffice it to say that excess alcohol destroys lives and 
families. In this section, I want to explain the part that alcohol plays in the 
life of the person with diabetes.
Because alcohol has calories, if you drink some, you must account for it in
your diet. The proof of the alcohol is the percentage of alcohol in an ounce of
the drink multiplied by 2. Wine that is 12.5 percent alcohol is 25 proof. Beer is
12 proof most of the time. Liquor is often 80 proof. To determine the calories,
use the following formula:
Calories = 0.8 8 × proof of the drink × number of ounces
So, for example, for a 12-ounce can of beer, you use the formula 0.8 × 12 8 × 12
for a total of 115 kilocalories.
For a couple of 6-ounce glasses of wine, you use the formula 0.8 8 × 25 8 × 12
to come up with 240 kilocalories.
You can see that the alcohol calories add up pretty quickly. You may even
wonder why alcoholics are not often overweight. The answer is that alcohol
becomes a staple of their diet, and they develop wasting diseases associated
with inadequate intake of protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, and minerals.
164
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

In addition to the calories, alcohol plays other roles in diabetes. If alcohol is
taken without food, it can cause low blood glucose by increasing the activity
of insulin without food to compensate for it. Some alcoholics, even without
diabetes, go to bed with several drinks in their systems and are unconscious
the next morning because of very low blood glucose. They can have brain
damage unless their bodies are able to manufacture enough glucose to wake
them up.
If you’re having a couple glasses of wine or other alcohol, make sure that you
eat some food along with it.
Using Sugar Substitutes
Fear of the “danger” of sugar in the diet has led to a vast effort to produce a
compound that can add the pleasurable sweetness without the liabilities of
sugar. Interestingly enough, despite the availability of a number of excellent
sweeteners, some containing no calories at all, the incidence of diabetes 
continues to rise. Still, if you can reduce your caloric intake or your glucose
response by using a sweetener, doing so has advantages. Sweeteners are
divided into those that contain calories and those that do not.
Among the calorie-containing sweeteners are
 Fructose, found in fruits and berries: Fructose is actually sweeter than
table sugar (sucrose). However, it is absorbed more slowly from the
intestine than glucose, so it raises the blood glucose more slowly. It is
taken up by the liver and converted to glucose or triglycerides.
 Xylitol, found in strawberries and raspberries: Xylitol is about like
fructose in terms of sweetness. It is taken up slowly from the intestine so
that it causes little change in blood glucose. Xylitol does not cause cavi-
ties of the teeth as often as the other sweeteners containing calories, so
it is used in chewing gum.
 Sorbitol and mannitol, sugar alcohols occurring in plants: Sorbitol and
mannitol are half as sweet as table sugar and have little effect on blood
glucose. They change to fructose in the body. (If you read Chapter 5, 
you may remember sorbitol. When taken as a food, sorbitol does not
accumulate and damage tissues.)
The non-nutritive or artificial sweeteners are often much sweeter than table
sugar. Therefore, much less of them is required to accomplish the same level
of sweetness as sugar. The current artificial sweeteners include
 Saccharin: This sweetener is 300 to 400 times sweeter than sucrose. It is
rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine. Brand names include Sweet ’N
Low and Sugar Twin.
165
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

 Aspartame: This sweetener is more expensive than saccharin, but many
people seem to prefer its taste. It’s 150 to 200 times sweeter than
sucrose. The brand name is Equal when used as a tabletop sweetener or
NutraSweet when used in food and beverages.
 Acesulfame: This sweetener is 200 times sweeter than sucrose and does
not leave an aftertaste. It can be used in cooking and is found in numer-
ous foods and beverages, as well as a tabletop sweetener. Its brand
name is Sunett or Sweet One. It should not be used by people with a rare
genetic disorder called phenylketonuria.
 Sucralose: This sweetener is obtained from sugar and is 600 times
sweeter. It is very stable and can be used in place of sugar in any food. 
It leaves no unpleasant aftertaste. The brand name is Splenda.
 Neotame: Authorized by the FDA in July 2000, neotame has 7,000 to
13,000 times the sweetening power of sucrose. It is not in commercial
products yet, but food manufacturers are working with it because it can
be used cooked or uncooked with no loss of sweetening. The brand
name is not yet determined.
 Cyclamate: Because it has been associated with cancer when given 
in huge doses, cyclamate is banned in the United States. It is 30 times 
as sweet as sucrose. The association with cancer has not been substan-
tiated, and this sweetener is awaiting reapproval by the FDA.
 Tagatose: This has been used only in 7-Eleven’s Diet Pepsi Slurpees so
far. Its production has been put on hold, but it should be available soon
again. It has about the same sweetening power as table sugar and is
called Naturlose.
For people with diabetes, recommendations regarding using sugar have been
changed so that some sugar is permitted. The point is to count the calories
eaten as sugar and subtract that from your permissible intake. If you do this,
you’ll have little use for either the nutritive or the non-nutritive sweeteners.
Eating Well for Type 1 Diabetes
A person with type 1 diabetes takes insulin (see Chapter 10) to control the
blood glucose. At this time, doctors and their patients cannot match the
human pancreas in the way that it releases insulin just when the food is
entering the bloodstream so that the glucose remains between 80 and 120
mg/dl. Therefore, the diabetic patient needs to make sure that his or her 
food enters as close to the expected activity of the insulin as possible.
Most people with type 1 diabetes take two different types of insulin: one that
acts soon after the injection and has a brief period of activity, and a second
that acts more slowly and lasts longer. The rapid-acting insulin is meant to
166
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

cover the food eaten at meals, while the slower acting insulin covers the rest
of the time, particularly overnight when a lot of circumstances tend to raise
the blood glucose.
Fortunately, you can take a new type of insulin when you start to eat or even
in the middle or at the end of a meal. (See Chapter 10 for more information 
on this insulin.) This insulin overcomes the problem that always previously
existed — that the shot had to be taken 30 minutes before eating to give it
time to be active. A person with diabetes who had a meal delayed for any
reason could easily become hypoglycemic using the old preparation.
The person with type 1 diabetes needs to be very careful when drinking alco-
hol. Alcohol increases the activity of insulin and can bring the blood glucose
way down if food is not taken with it. (See the section on “Counting Alcohol
as Part of Your Diet,” earlier in this chapter.)
Because the person with type 1 diabetes always has some injected insulin cir-
culating whether food is available or not, this patient should not miss a meal.
A midmorning snack, a midafternoon snack, and even a bedtime snack, if nec-
essary, are particularly good ideas.
The person with type 1 diabetes needs to be willing to test the blood glucose
frequently. That way, he or she can identify problems in advance. If, for exam-
ple, blood glucose is low before exercise (see Chapter 9), you can take some
nutrition to avoid hypoglycemia.
For much more on this subject see my new book, Type 1 Diabetes For
Dummies (Wiley).
Eating Well for Type 2 Diabetes
Because most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight, weight control 
and reduction should be the major consideration. (See the next section for
specific techniques to lose weight.)
The benefits of weight loss are rapidly seen, even when relatively little has
been lost. The blood glucose falls rapidly. The blood pressure declines. The
cholesterol falls. The triglycerides drop, and the good cholesterol (HDL)
rises. As I point out in Chapter 5, even a modest reduction of 10 percent of
body weight has a significant positive effect on coronary artery disease.
The person with type 2 diabetes has to be very aware of the fats in his 
or her diet. The metabolic syndrome (see Chapter 5) is commonly found 
in this type of diabetes. You must pay attention to foods that increase 
triglycerides, which lead to the production of small, dense LDL particles 
that are connected to coronary artery disease.
167
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

Because hypertension is so prevalent in both types of diabetes and it makes
diabetic complications occur earlier, reduction of salt intake is another
important consideration.
Reducing Your Weight
Weight reduction is difficult for many reasons. In my experience, most
patients do very well initially but tend to return to old habits. There is evi-
dence that this tendency to regain weight is built into the human brain. 
When fat tissue is decreased or even increased, a central control system in
the brain acts to restore the fat to the previous level. If liposuction is done,
for example, the remaining cells swell up to hold more fat.
Still, losing weight and keeping it off is possible. At one time, it was calculated
that only 1 out of 20 people who lost weight would keep it off. Now the figure
is closer to 1 out of 5.
In the next chapter, I cover the value of exercise in a weight-loss program. 
At this point, you need to realize that successful maintenance of weight loss
requires a willingness to make exercise a part of your daily life. If, for some
reason, you cannot move your legs to exercise, you can get a satisfactory
workout using your upper body alone. A recent study showed that 92 percent
of people who maintain weight loss exercise regularly, while only 34 percent
of those who regain their weight continue to exercise.
Types of diets
The numerous methods that are available for weight loss certainly suggest
that no one method is especially better than all the rest. Some are fairly dras-
tic in the degree to which they cut calories, and weight loss is fairly rapid.
But these methods are particularly prone to result in restoration of the 
original weight. Among the many more drastic diets are the following:
 Very low calorie diets: These diets provide 400 to 800 kcalories daily 
of protein and carbohydrate with supplemental vitamins and minerals.
They are safe when supervised by a physician and are used when you
need rapid weight loss — for example, for a heart condition. They result
in rapid initial weight loss with a fall in the need for medications. Weight
restoration commonly occurs, however.
 Animal protein diets like the Atkins diet: Food is limited to animal pro-
tein sources in an effort to maintain body protein, along with vitamins
and minerals. Carbohydrates are strongly discouraged. Patients often
complain of hair loss. Weight is rapidly regained when the diet is discon-
tinued. This is not a balanced diet, and I don’t recommend it for more
168
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

than a few weeks. Because the Atkins diet encourages foods that are
high in fats, a variation called the South Beach Diet was developed that
emphasizes decreased carbohydrates along with decreased fats.
 LEARN diet: The name stands for lifestyle, exercise, attitudes, relation-
ships, and nutrition. It recommends a diet of 55 to 60 percent carbohy-
drate and less than 10 percent from fat.
 Fasts: A fast means giving up all food for a period of time and taking only
water and vitamins and minerals. A fast is such a drastic change from
normal eating habits that patients do not remain on the fast for very
long, and weight is regained.
Several diets are associated with large organizations and may require that
you purchase only their foods. The support given by these organizations
seems to be extremely helpful in weight-loss maintenance. In addition, the
slower loss of weight and the connection to more normal eating seems to
result in a greater tendency to stay with the program and keep the weight 
off. The leading contenders for this type of diet are
 Jenny Craig: This organization provides the food that you eat, which
you must pay for. It offers some information on behavior modification
and has special diets for people with diabetes. In 1997, the government
required Jenny Craig to tell its customers that the weight-loss methods
may be only temporary, because customers had no way to judge from 
its advertising that many people regain their weight.
 Weight Watchers: This organization emphasizes slow weight loss, exer-
cise, and behavior modification. It charges for weekly attendance at 
its meetings, which are held all over the world. It does not require that 
you purchase any products, but Weight Watchers foods are available for
purchase. Its point program for increasing fiber in your diet may be
especially helpful to the person with diabetes.
Do any of these diets have an advantage over the others? Researchers at
Stanford University put four groups of overweight women on four different
popular diets — Atkins, Ornish, LEARN, and the Zone — for a year. The result
was that those people who stuck with the Atkins diet lost significantly more
than the women on the other diets, about 12 pounds. Weight loss on the
other diets was the same, about five pounds. Does that depress you? It
shouldn’t, because even that modest weight loss was associated with a 7 to
15 percent reduction of the risk of heart disease. The study was published in
the Journal of the American Medical Association in March 2007.
The National Weight Control Registry, which has been running since 1993,
shows that people can lose a lot of weight and keep it off. The average loss is
60 pounds and is maintained for more than five years. These “losers” do it on
their own half the time. They use a combination of a low-fat diet and at least
45 minutes of exercise daily, usually walking, to keep the weight off even
169
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

though the initial weight loss was accomplished in many different ways like a
liquid diet in an organized program, other types of organized programs, or on
their own. Most of them (68 percent) eat breakfast every day. The longer they
kept the weight off, the easier it became to continue weight maintenance.
Surgery for weight loss
I want to say a few words about surgery for weight reduction. Surgery is used
in the most severe and resistant cases of obesity. It has impressive effects,
such as correction of high glucose and reduction or discontinuation of glu-
cose-lowering drugs. Results are so successful in some patients that some
surgeons consider type 2 diabetes to be a surgical disease. That, I believe, is
a little extreme.
Some of the reasons for considering surgery include
 You have a body mass index (see Chapter 7) that is greater than 40.
 You have an obesity-related physical problem, such as inability to walk.
 You have a high-risk obesity-related health problem like heart disease.
Formerly, the best surgical treatment for obesity was the vertical banded gas-
troplasty, where the upper stomach is stapled to create a small, thumb-sized
pouch above, a narrow opening, and a larger pouch below. Because the upper
pouch is small, you have a feeling of early fullness, and you tend to eat less.
The upper pouch is connected to the small intestine so that the lower stom-
ach is bypassed. Patients are forced to eat very small portions and can’t eat
sugar and other carbohydrates, which cause dizziness and other symptoms.
Most of the weight is lost in the first year.
More recently, the laparoscopic gastric banding procedure has been used. A
constricting band containing an inflatable balloon is placed around the upper
end of the stomach to create a small upper pouch and a larger lower pouch.
It can be inflated or deflated to control the size of the upper stomach. The
usual weight loss is two-thirds of the excess within two years. By removing
the band, the procedure can be reversed. This is a simpler operation than
gastric bypass and is less likely to result in a surgical complication.
Some of the problems of gastric banding include the following:
 The pouch may stretch.
 The band may slip.
 The reservoir in the constricting band that permits inflation may leak.
170
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

 Weight loss may not occur (if the patient chooses to overeat).
 The patient may experience acid reflux from the stomach into the 
esophagus.
 The patient may experience persistent vomiting.
When you have surgery for obesity, you must be committed to lifelong med-
ical follow-up. You must be willing to give up large meals and be determined
to lose weight. There is no question that severely obese patients with type 2
diabetes do well with surgery. As they lose weight, their blood glucose falls,
their cholesterol falls, and their blood pressure improves. They sleep better
and are less depressed.
As for liposuction and its possible role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes,
there are few studies on the subject and they are short-term, but early
reports showed some promise. For example, a report in the Annals of Plastic
Surgery in January 2004 showed a fall in glucose, cholesterol, and insulin
secretion after liposuction, but this was only at three weeks after surgery. 
A report from the New England Journal of Medicine later that year in June
showed that liposuction did not significantly improve obesity-associated
metabolic abnormalities after three months of observation.
Behavior modification
Years of working with obese patients have shown me that weight loss
requires more than a commitment to a sound diet and routine exercise; it
requires changes in behavior with respect to food. To lose weight and keep 
it off, you must change your eating behavior to make your diet easier to
follow. Some of the best techniques include the following:
 Eat according to a schedule to avoid unplanned eating.
 Find a single place to eat all food.
 Slow down your eating to make the meal last.
 Put high calorie foods away. Remove serving dishes and bread from 
the table.
 Don’t dispense food to others to avoid exposure for yourself.
 Do not clean your plate.
 Set realistic goals for weight loss.
 When eating out, be careful of salad dressing, alcohol, and bread.
171
Chapter 8: Diabetes Diet Plan

 Get a ten-pound weight and carry it around for a while to appreciate the
importance of losing even that little.
 At the market, buy from a list, carry only enough money for the food on
that list, and avoid aisles containing loose foods, other than fruits and
vegetables, like loose candy.
Incorporate one technique into your life each week (or even longer) until 
you feel you have mastered it and have added it to your eating style. Then go
on and take up another technique.
As you go about this difficult task of losing weight and keeping it off, remem-
ber to seek the help of those around you. A loving partner provides great
help through the roughest days.
In an effort to lose weight, some people with diabetes skip their insulin 
shots. If you do so, your body will turn to fat for fuel because glucose can’t 
be used (see Chapter 2), and you will lose weight. However, the result is that
you also lose muscle mass, and your blood glucose rises very high. This is a
dangerous situation and not a healthy approach to weight loss.
Coping with Eating Disorders
You can’t be too rich or too thin. How much damage has this statement 
done to society, especially the thin part? Young people, particularly girls, are
preoccupied with their body weight. When this preoccupation becomes too
great, it can result in an eating disorder.
Signs of anorexia or bulimia
Young girls with eating disorders (and young boys about a tenth as often)
either starve themselves and exercise excessively or eat a great deal and
then induce vomiting and/or take laxatives and water pills. Someone who
starves herself has anorexia nervosa, while someone who binges and purges
has bulimia nervosa. By themselves, these conditions can result in severe 
illness and even death when carried to extremes. When combined with 
diabetes, the danger increases greatly.
Anorexia is usually found in middle- and upper-class girls. They have a dis-
torted body image and are fearful of weight gain. The prevalence may be as
high as 1 in 200 in these girls. Their parents are usually very concerned with
172
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

slimness. The girls may appear unusually thin and do not menstruate. Their
malnutrition may be so severe that they die from it.
People with anorexia are in a constant state of starvation. When they have
diabetes, their condition is just like that of people with type 1 diabetes before
the availability of insulin. They have very low blood glucose levels, so little 
or no insulin is required (see Chapter 10). They develop problems with their
hearts and have low blood pressure and low body temperature. They lose a
lot of body musculature once the fat is gone.
If you think you know someone with this disorder, here are some of the clues
to look for:
 She eats more rapidly than others do.
 She eats until uncomfortably full.
 She eats large amounts of food even when she is not hungry.
 She eats by herself because she is embarrassed.
 She feels guilty or disgusted after overeating.
Bulimia involves eating large quantities of easily digested food and then 
purging it by vomiting and taking laxatives or water pills. These patients are
usually not as severely thin as patients with anorexia. However, their back-
grounds are often similar to those of anorexia patients: They may represent
up to 40 percent of college-age female students. Because their weight is
closer to normal, they usually menstruate normally.
Management of diabetes requires a certain amount of routine from day to
day. There is no way to achieve such systematization when the amount of
food coming into the body is so uncertain.
The girl with severe anorexia may require intravenous feeding until she 
is stabilized a little bit. This sometimes leads to very high blood glucose
levels, necessitating the use of insulin. After the life-threatening starvation 
is under control, it is possible to achieve good blood glucose control with
help from the patient and a therapist who can help her to understand her 
distorted body image. If she suffers from clinical depression, antidepressant
medication may be necessary.
With a bulimic patient, the food intake is extremely variable but less severe
than that of an anorexic. Therefore, diabetes is a little easier to treat. However,
girls with bulimia are more likely to go on to adult obesity and are harder to
treat psychologically. They actually do not do as well with therapy as those
with anorexia. They end up with more psychiatric problems later in life.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of exercise
 Tailoring exercise for type 1 and type 2 patients
 Determining how long and how hard to exercise
 Choosing your activity
M
ore than 60 years ago, the great leaders in diabetes care declared that
diabetes management has three major aspects:
 Proper diet
 Appropriate medication
 Sufficient exercise
Since then, millions of dollars and man (and woman) hours have been spent
to define the proper diet and the right medication, but exercise has rarely
received its proper place in the triad of care. I am writing this chapter to cor-
rect that omission.
Exercise has become so central to diabetes care, especially type 2 diabetes
that authors of articles on diabetes have titles, such as:
 “Make Your Diabetic Patients Walk,” Diabetes Care, June 2005
 “Walking to Work Is an Independent Predictor of Incidence of Type 2
Diabetes in Japanese Men,” Diabetes Care, September 2007
 “Exercise Training Improves Glycemic Control in Long-Standing Insulin-
Treated Type 2 Diabetic Patients,” Diabetes Care, October 2007
 “Exercise Is Required for Visceral Fat Loss in Postmenopausal Women
with Type 2 Diabetes,” Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,
March 2005
 “Increase in Physical Activity Energy Expenditure Is Associated With
Reduced Metabolic Risk Independent of Change in Fatness and Fitness,”
Diabetes Care, August 2007

These titles should tell you, before I even write another word, how central
exercise is to your health. And not just if you have diabetes. Grab your
spouse, significant other, child, parent, grandparent, or great grandparent,
and start walking!
Getting Off the Couch: Why 
Exercise Is Essential
When the diabetes experts wrote their recommendations for proper care, the
isolation and administration of insulin had just recently begun, and they were
focusing specifically on how to control type 1 diabetes. Since that time, many
studies have shown that exercise doesn’t normalize the blood glucose or
reduce the hemoglobin A1c (see Chapter 7) in type 1 diabetes. Many other
studies have shown that exercise does normalize blood glucose and reduce
hemoglobin A1c in type 2 diabetes.
But while exercise cannot replace medication for the type 1 diabetic, its 
benefits are crucial for patients with both types of diabetes.
Preventing macrovascular disease
The major benefit of exercise for both types of diabetes is to prevent
macrovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or diminished blood flow to the
legs). Macrovascular disease affects everyone, whether they have diabetes or
not, but is particularly severe in people with diabetes. Exercise prevents
macrovascular disease in numerous ways:
 Exercise helps with weight loss, which is especially important in type 
2 diabetes.
 Exercise lowers bad cholesterol and triglycerides, and it raises good
cholesterol.
 Exercise lowers blood pressure.
 Exercise lowers stress levels.
 Exercise reduces the need for insulin or drugs.
Taking charge of your health
John Plant is a 46-year-old male who has had type 1 diabetes for 23 years. He
takes insulin shots four times daily and measures his blood glucose multiple
times a day. He follows a careful diet.
176
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Prior to developing diabetes, he was a very active person, participating in
vigorous sports and doing major hiking and mountain climbing. At the time,
his doctor warned him that he would have to give up many of the most stren-
uous activities because he would never know his blood glucose level and it
might drop precipitously during heavy exercise. He ignored this advice and
continued his active way of life. He found that he could do with much less
insulin than his doctor prescribed and rarely became hypoglycemic. He has
been able to continue these activities without limitation. His blood glucose
level is generally between 75 and 140. His last hemoglobin A1c was slightly
elevated at 5.7 (see Chapter 7). A recent eye examination showed no diabetic
retinopathy (see Chapter 5). He has no significant microalbuminuria in his
urine and no tingling in his feet (see Chapter 5).
Is John lucky? You bet he is. But like most “luck,” his is based on a self-
realization that the human body is made up of both a mind and a body. If
humans were meant to spend their lives munching potato chips in front 
of a TV set, why would they have all these muscles?
When a new diabetic patient enters my office, I give him a bottle of 50 pills. 
I instruct him not to swallow the pills but to drop them on the floor three
times daily and pick them up one at a time. The condition a person is in can
be judged by which thing he or she takes two at a time: pills or stairs.
Understanding your body mechanics
during exercise
The feeling of fatigue that occurs with exercise is probably due to the loss of
stored muscle glucose. 
With exercise, insulin levels in nondiabetics and people with type 2 diabetes
decline, because insulin acts to store and not release glucose and fat. Levels
of glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone increase to provide
more glucose. Studies show that glucagon is responsible for 60 percent of 
the glucose, and epinephrine and cortisol are responsible for the other 40
percent. If insulin did not fall, glucagon could not stimulate the liver to make
glucose.
You might wonder how insulin can open the cell to the entry of glucose when
insulin levels are falling. In fact, two things are at work here. Glucose is get-
ting into muscle cells without the need for insulin, and the rapid circulation
that comes with exercise is delivering the smaller amount of insulin more 
frequently to the muscle. The muscle seems to be more sensitive to the
insulin as well. This is exactly what the person with type 2 diabetes hopes 
to accomplish when insulin resistance is the major block to insulin action.
177
Chapter 9: Keeping It Moving: Exercise Plan

One way to preserve glucose stores is to provide calories from an external
source. Any marathoner knows that additional calories can delay the feeling
of exhaustion. The timing is important. If the glucose is given an hour before
exercise, it will be metabolized during the exercise and increase endurance.
However, if it’s given 30 minutes before exercise, it may decrease stamina by
stimulating insulin, which blocks liver production of glucose. 
Fructose can replenish you when you’re doing prolonged exercise. This
sweetener can replace glucose because it is sweeter but is absorbed more
slowly and does not provoke the insulin secretion that glucose provokes.
Fructose is rapidly converted into glucose inside the body. (See Chapter 8 for
more on fructose.)
Reaping the benefits
As your body becomes trained with regular exercise, the benefits for your
diabetes are very significant. Your body starts to turn to fat for energy 
earlier in the course of your exercise. At the same time, the hormones that
tend to raise the blood glucose during exercise are not produced at the 
same high rate because they aren’t needed. Because you don’t require as
much insulin, your insulin doses can be reduced, and it’s much easier to
avoid hypoglycemia during exercise.
Exercising When You Have Diabetes
If you have diabetes and have not exercised previously, you should check
with a doctor prior to beginning a new exercise program, especially if you’re
over the age of 35 or if you’ve had diabetes for ten years or longer. You
should also check with a doctor if you have any of the following risk factors:
 The presence of any diabetic complications like retinopathy, nephropa-
thy, or neuropathy (see Chapter 5)
 Obesity
 A physical limitation
 A history of coronary artery disease or elevated blood pressure
 Use of medications
You need to discuss these issues with your doctor in order to choose the
appropriate exercises. I say more about the choice of exercise in the section
“Is Golf a Sport? Choosing Your Activity,” later in this chapter.
178
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

When you begin to exercise, whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, 
you can take many steps to make your experience safe and healthful. Some
important steps to take include the following:
 Wear an ID bracelet.
 Test your blood glucose very often.
 Choose proper socks and shoes.
 Drink plenty of water.
 Carry treatment for hypoglycemia.
 Exercise with a friend.
And here are some things to avoid when you exercise:
 Don’t assume that you have to buy lots of special clothing to exercise.
The right shoes and socks are essential, but other than that, you need
special clothing only if your sport demands it (such as soft pants for 
the cyclist).
 Don’t expect to lose certain “spots” by repetitively exercising them.
 Don’t exercise to the point of pain.
 Don’t get too focused on using exercise gadgets, like belts or other
objects, that do not require you to move.
Working out with type 1 diabetes
The person with type 1 diabetes depends on insulin injections to manage the
blood glucose. He or she does not have the luxury of a “thermostat” that
automatically shuts off during exercise and turns back on when exercise is
finished. After an insulin shot is taken, it is active until it is used up.
The person with type 1 diabetes has to avoid overdosing on insulin before
exercise, which can lead to hypoglycemia, or underdosing, which can lead to
hyperglycemia. If the body does not have enough insulin, it turns to fat for
energy. Glucose rises because it is not being metabolized but its production
is continuing. If exercise is particularly vigorous in a situation of not enough
insulin, the blood glucose can rise extremely high.
Reducing your insulin dosage prior to exercise helps prevent hypoglycemia.
One study showed that an 80 percent reduction of the dose allowed the
person with diabetes to exercise for 3 hours, while a 50 percent reduction
forced the person with diabetes to stop after 90 minutes due to hypo-
glycemia. Each person with diabetes varies, and you must determine for
yourself how much to reduce insulin by measuring the blood glucose before,
during, and after exercise.
179
Chapter 9: Keeping It Moving: Exercise Plan

Another way to prevent hypoglycemia, of course, is to eat some carbohy-
drate (see Chapter 8). You need to have some carbohydrate (which quickly
raises blood glucose) available during exercise.
In addition, the site of the insulin injection is important because this determines
how fast the insulin becomes active. If you are running and inject insulin into
your leg, it will be taken up more quickly than an injection into the arm.
You can exercise whenever you will do it faithfully. If you like to sleep late and
you schedule your exercise at 5:30 a.m., you probably won’t consistently do
it. Your best time to exercise is probably about 60 to 90 minutes after eating
because this is when the glucose is peaking, providing the calories you need;
if you exercise at this time you avoid the usual post-eating high in your blood
glucose, and you burn up those food calories.
Working out with type 2 diabetes
Other than the insulin discussion, many of the suggestions for the type 1
patient in the previous section apply to type 2 patients as well.
With sufficient exercise and diet, some people with type 2 diabetes can revert
to a nondiabetic state. This does not mean that they no longer have diabetes,
but it certainly means that they will not develop the long-term complications
that can make them so miserable later in life (see Chapter 5).
Determining How Much Exercise to Do
Unless you have a physical abnormality, there is no limitation on what 
you can do. You need to select an activity that you enjoy and will continue 
to perform.
180
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 
What are aerobic and anaerobic exercise?
Aerobic exercise is exercise that can be sus-
tained for more than a few minutes, uses major
groups of muscles, and gets your heart to pump
faster during the exercise, thus training the
heart. I give you many examples of aerobic
exercise throughout this chapter.
Anaerobic exercise, on the other hand, is brief
(sometimes a few seconds) and intense and
usually cannot be sustained. Lifting large
weights is an example of an anaerobic exercise.
A 100-yard dash is another example.

Exerting enough effort
In the recent past, exercise physiologists said that you needed to make sure
that you monitored your exercise intensity by periodically checking your
heart rate. Your exercise heart rate was supposed to be based on your age.
The usual formula to figure this out is to take the number 220, subtract your
age, and multiply that number by 60 to 75 percent to get the recommended
exercise heart rate for aerobic exercise. (See the sidebar “What are aerobic
and anaerobic exercise?” if you’re not sure what aerobic exercise is.)
Now studies have shown that people can sustain aerobic exercise at higher
heart rates. Perhaps the best way to know whether you’re meeting your exer-
cise goals is to use the “Perceived Exertion Scale” described in the sidebar
“Checking the value of your exercise.”
The younger you are, the faster your exercise heart rate may be. Like every-
thing in this book, your exercise heart rate is an individual number. If you are
a world-class athlete training for your ninth marathon, your exercise heart
rate may be higher. If you have some heart disease, your exercise heart rate
may be significantly lower.
181
Chapter 9: Keeping It Moving: Exercise Plan
Checking the value of your exercise
Measuring your pulse during exercise (or even
at rest) may be hard for you. Instead, you can use
the Perceived Exertion Scale. Exercise is given a
descriptive value from very, very light to very,
very hard with very light, fairly light, somewhat
hard, and very hard in between. You want to
exercise to a level of somewhat hard, and you
will be at your target heart rate in most cases. As
you get into shape, the amount of exertion that
corresponds to somewhat hard will increase.
Here is a description of these various levels of
exercise:
 Extremely light exercise is very easy to do
and requires little or no exertion.
 Very light exercise is like walking slowly for
several minutes.
 Light exercise is like walking faster but at a
pace you can continue without effort.
 Somewhat hard exercise is getting a little
difficult but still feels okay to continue.
 Very hard exercise is difficult to continue.
You have to push yourself, and you’re very
tired. At this level, you have trouble talking.
The very hard level of exercise is most 
beneficial.
 Extremely hard exercise is the most difficult
exercise you’ve ever done.
Do not continue exercising if you have tightness
in your chest, chest pain, severe shortness of
breath, or dizziness.

Devoting an hour a day
When you know your maximal exercise heart rate, you can choose your activ-
ity and use the “Perceived Exertion Scale” to be sure that you achieve that
level during exercise. I must repeat that the best choice of exercise for you is
an exercise you enjoy and will continue to perform.
The choices are really limitless. The number of kcalories you use for any
exercise is determined by your weight, the strenuousness of the activity, 
and the time you spend actually doing it. In the past it was suggested that 
in order to have a positive effect on your heart, you need to do a moderate
level of exercise for 20 to 45 minutes at least three times a week. In 2002, 
the Institute of Medicine (the medical division of the National Academies)
recommended that in order to maintain health and a normal body weight,
you need to do one hour of exercise a day.
An hour (not an apple) a day keeps the doctor away! Moderate aerobic exer-
cise done for an hour every day provides enormous physical, mental, and
emotional benefits.
You need to warm up and cool down for about five minutes before and after
you exercise. Stretching is one possibility for both warm-up and cool-down. 
I am not going to discuss stretching in detail because the place of stretching
for the healthy exerciser is not clear. One study showed that a group of run-
ners who did not stretch did better than a group who did. Most doctors 
agree that stretching after an injury is appropriate, but whether all the advice
about stretching before exercise for an uninjured person is much ado about
nothing is yet to be determined. If you do stretch, do not stretch to the point
that it hurts. This is where muscle tears occur. See the excellent book Fitness
For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent, M.A.
(Wiley), for more about stretching.
Making moderate exercise your goal
Moderate exercise has a moving definition. If you’re out of shape, moderate
exercise for you may be slow walking. If you’re in good shape, moderate exer-
cise may be jogging or cross-country skiing. Moderate exercise is simply
something you can do and not get out of breath. For ideas on the types of
exercise you can do, see the following section.
How long can you stop exercise before you start to decondition? It takes 
only about two to three weeks to lose some of the fitness your exercise has
provided. Then it takes up to six weeks to get back to your current level,
assuming that your holiday from exercise does not go on too long.
182
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Is Golf a Sport? Choosing Your Activity
The following factors can help you determine your choice of activity:
 Do you like to exercise alone or with company? Pick a competitive or
team sport if you prefer company.
 Do you like to compete against others or just yourself? Running or 
walking are sports you can do alone.
 Do you prefer vigorous or less vigorous activity? Less vigorous activity
over a longer period is just as effective as more vigorous activity.
 Do you live where you can do activities outside year-round, or do you
need to go inside a lot of the year? Find a sports club if weather prevents
year-round outside activity.
 Do you need special equipment or just a pair of running shoes?
 What benefits are you looking for in your exercise: Cardiovascular,
strength, endurance, flexibility, or body fat control? You should probably
look for all these benefits, but you may have to combine activities to get
them all in.
Perhaps a good starting point in your activity selection is to focus on the 
benefits. Table 9-1 gives you some ideas.

When you need support
The Diabetes Exercise and Sports Association
is an organization that you can turn to for help,
instruction, and friendship as you add exercise
to your good diabetes care. You can reach this
organization by writing P.O. Box 1935, Litchfield
Park, AZ 85340, or by calling 800-898-4322. They
know all about diabetes and sports and are
eager to share the information with you. They
have a newly reconstructed Web site at
http://www.diabetes-exercise.
org/about.asp.

Table 9-1 (continued)
If You Want to . . .
Then Consider . . .
Build up muscular endurance
Gymnastics, rowing, cross-country skiing,
vigorous basketball
Increase flexibility
Gymnastics, judo and karate, soccer, surfing
Control body fat
Handball, racquetball, squash, cross-coun-
try skiing, vigorous basketball, singles tennis
You can tell from Table 9-1 that living in the mountains where you have plenty
of snow is helpful because cross-country skiing is on almost every list. On the
other hand, so is vigorous basketball, so you don’t have to give up exercise if
you live in a warm climate like Florida.
The special needs of many of these sports may turn you off to exercise. The
curious thing is that the best exercise that you can sustain for life is right at
your feet. A brisk daily walk improves heart function, adds to muscular
endurance, and helps control body fat. So many people drive their cars to the
gym and try to park as close as possible so that they can get to the building
with as little effort as possible. Seems a little strange, doesn’t it?
Of course, the social benefits of exercise are very important. You are together
with people who are concerned with health and appearance. These people
usually share many of your interests. The person who likes to jog often likes
to hike and climb and camp out. Many lifetime partnerships begin on one
side of a tennis court (and some end there as well).
Cross-training, where you do several different activities throughout the week,
is a good idea. Cross-training reduces the boredom that may accompany
doing one thing day after day. It also permits you to exercise regardless of the
weather because you can do some things indoors and some outside.
Table 9-2 lists a variety of activities, including some that don’t exactly fit into
the category of exercise but offer some interesting comparisons. Next to each
activity, I include the amount of kcalories that you burn in 20 minutes.

Everything you do burns calories. Even sleeping and watching television use
20 kcalories in 20 minutes if you weigh 125 pounds.
Your choice of an activity must take into account your physical condition. 
If you have diabetic neuropathy (see Chapter 5) and cannot feel your feet,
you do not want to do pounding exercises that may damage them without
your awareness. You can swim, bike, row, or do armchair exercises where
you move your upper body vigorously. One of my favorite relatively new
machines that give you a good workout without trauma to your joints is the
elliptical trainer, but you may have to join a club to get at one unless you 
buy one for home.
If you have diabetic retinopathy (see Chapter 5), you won’t want to do exer-
cises that raise your blood pressure (like weight lifting), cause jerky motions
in your eyes (like bouncing on a trampoline), or change the pressure in your
eyes significantly (like scuba diving or high mountain climbing). You also
should not do exercises that place your eyes below the level of your heart,
such as when you touch your toes.
Patients with nephropathy (see Chapter 5) should avoid exercises that raise
the blood pressure for prolonged periods. These exercises are extremely
intense activities that you do for a long time, like marathon running.
185
Chapter 9: Keeping It Moving: Exercise Plan

Some people have pain in the legs after they walk a certain distance. This
may be due to diminished blood supply to the legs so that the needs of the
muscles in the legs cannot be met. Although you need to discuss this prob-
lem with your doctor, you do not need to give up walking. Instead, determine
the distance you can walk up to the point of pain. Then walk about three-
quarters of that distance and stop to give the circulation a chance to catch
up. After you have rested, you will find that you can go about the same dis-
tance again without pain. By stringing several of these walks together, you
can get a good, pain-free workout. You may even find that you are able to
increase the distance after a while because this kind of training tends to
create new blood vessels.
Is there a medical condition that should absolutely prevent you from doing
exercise? Short of chest pain at rest, which must be addressed by your
doctor, the answer is no. If you cannot figure out an exercise that you can 
do, get together with an exercise therapist. You will be amazed at how many
muscles you can move that you never knew you had.
Walking 10K a Day
The idea of walking 10,000 steps a day may seem like a huge, unattainable
goal to you, but you may be surprised. This is certainly a goal worth striving
toward because, as I discuss previously in this chapter, walking is one of the
most beneficial exercises you can do.
The first step toward reaching this goal is to buy a pedometer, a device that
you wear on your waist that counts each step you take. Don’t buy a fancy 
one with a lot of bells and whistles. All you need is to be able to count your
steps and, if you want, to convert the steps into miles. To do this, you need 
to know how far you walk each time you take a step. Walk ten steps, measure
the distance, and divide by ten to get your stride length. Input this number 
in the appropriate place in the pedometer, and it will give you the miles that
correspond with the steps you walk.
Accusplit pedometers work very well. The model I like is the Accusplit 
Eagle, which does nothing but record your steps. You can find it at www.
accusplit.com/product.html. You also can find pedometers at sporting
goods stores.
Begin by doing your usual amount of exercise each day. Remember to record
the steps at the end of the day and reset the button on the pedometer to
zero. After seven days, add up the steps and divide by seven to get your daily
count. You will probably find that you are doing between 3,000 and 5,000
steps a day.
186
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Next, you want to build up your daily number. Here are some tips to help:
 Get a good pair of walking shoes or sneakers and replace them when
they begin to wear out.
 Leave your car parked. If you can make a trip in an hour or less by foot,
save your gas money and add substantially to your daily step count.
 Try to add a few hundred steps a week. Begin by identifying a baseline
day in your first week when you did the most steps, and make every day
like that one. Each week add a few hundred more.
 Find an exercise buddy to walk with you. It’s much more fun.
 Keep a record of the number of steps involved in various walks you take,
so you can easily get the steps you are missing on any given day.
 Use stairs instead of the elevator, whether you’re going up or down.
 Take a walk at lunchtime daily.
 Stop if you feel pain, and check with your doctor before continuing.
If you don’t have a pedometer, or if you want to count other types of exercise
toward your walking goal, use the following conversions:
 1 mile = 2,100 average steps
 1 block = 100 average steps
 10 minutes walking = 1,200 steps on average
 Biking or swimming = 150 steps per minute
 Weight lifting = 100 steps per minute
 Rollerskating = 200 steps per minute
If you like tangible rewards for what you do (besides the reward of a lower
blood glucose, a lower cholesterol, a lower blood pressure, and possibly 
a lower weight), join the President’s Challenge at www.presidents
challenge.org. It provides a place to record your activity, and it offers 
all kinds of information on activities for every age. You choose what you 
like to do, and every time you do it you record your progress. It gives you
points towards awards.
If you prefer to follow an actual trail, take a virtual walk on the American
Discovery Trail, a 5,048-mile walk across America from Delaware to
California. You can find it at http://www.discoverytrail.org. Every
time you walk, convert your steps into miles and see how far they take you
along that trail. The page has links to all the sights you will see. If you have
trouble converting your steps into miles, just use the steps and eliminate the
last two digits (so 10,000 steps becomes 100 miles).

A study in the Archives of Internal Medicine in June 2003 provides the best
evidence for the benefits of walking. Diabetics who walked at least 2 hours a
week had a 40 percent lower death rate than inactive diabetics. 
The study that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter entitled “Make
Your Diabetic Patients Walk” followed 179 patients with type 2 diabetes who
were divided into six groups and followed for two years. The groups differed
in the amount of increased exercise they did. For example the first group did
a little more exercise by the end of the study while the last group did much
more exercise by the end of the study. The other groups fell in between those
extremes. The results were that the highest exercisers had the lowest blood
pressure, greatest weight loss, greatest reduction in total cholesterol and bad
cholesterol and increase in good cholesterol, greatest reduction in blood 
glucose, and greatest reduction in money spent on drugs. While the people
who did the least exercise had no change in the cost of their annual medica-
tions, the highest exercisers had a reduction of $660 per year. What are you
waiting for? Take the first steps!
Lifting Weights
Weight lifting is a form of anaerobic exercise. (See the sidebar earlier in this
chapter if you’re not sure what anaerobic exercise is.) It involves the move-
ment of heavy weights, which can be moved only for brief periods of time. 
It results in significant muscle strengthening and increased endurance.
Doctors are looking for drugs that can increase insulin sensitivity (see
Chapter 10). You need look no further. Lifting weights has been shown in 
several studies to accomplish this. Writing in Diabetes Care in September
2007, a group of investigators from the Centers for Disease Control showed
that muscle-strengthening activity significantly increased insulin sensitivity,
thereby lowering the blood glucose and the hemoglobin A1c in 4,500 adults
between the ages of 20 and 70.
Older adults from age 50 and above who were given only eight weeks of flexi-
bility and resistance training had substantial improvement in strength and
flexibility while their glucose levels improved as well.
Because weight lifting causes a significant rise in blood pressure as it is being
done, people with severe diabetic eye disease should not do it.
Weight training, which uses lighter weights, can be a form of aerobic exercise.
Because the weights are light, they can be moved for prolonged periods of
time. The result is improved cardiovascular fitness along with strengthening
of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones. Weight training is an excellent
way to protect and strengthen a joint that is beginning to develop some 
discomfort.

I recommend that you do seven different exercises with light weights every
other day, or daily if possible. Choose weights that permit you to do each
exercise ten times in a row for three sets of ten with a rest in between. You
should need only five to ten minutes to complete all seven, and the benefits
will be huge. These exercises are the bicep curl, shoulder press, lateral raise,
bent-over rowing, good mornings, flys, and pullovers.
Figure 9-1 shows the bicep curl. To do this exercise:
1. Hold the dumbbells along the sides of your body, palms facing 
forward.
2. Raise the dumbbells until your elbows are fully bent.
3. Slowly lower the dumbbells to the original position.
Figure 9-2 shows the shoulder press. To do this exercise:
1. Hold the dumbbells with your palms facing each other and your
elbows bent.
2. Raise the dumbbells over your head, turning your palms to face 
forward.
3. Lower the dumbbells to the original position.
Figure 9-1:
Bicep curl.

Chapter 9: Keeping It Moving: Exercise Plan

Figure 9-3 shows the lateral raise. To do this exercise:
1. Hold the dumbbells along the sides of your body, palms facing each
other.
2. Lift the dumbbells out to the sides, palms facing the floor until they
are above your head.
3. Lower the dumbbells down to your sides.
Figure 9-4 shows bent-over rowing. To do this exercise:
1. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, arms hanging down, legs straight, and
back parallel to the floor.
2. Raise the dumbbells up to your chest.
3. Lower the dumbbells back to the floor.
Figure 9-5 shows good mornings. To do this exercise:
1. Hold the ends of one dumbbell above your head, arms straight.
2. Lower the dumbbell forward as you bend your back parallel to 
the floor.
3. Raise the dumbbell to the original position.

Figure 9-6 shows flys. To do this exercise:
1. Lie on your back and hold the dumbbells out to each side at the 
shoulder.
2. Lift the dumbbells together until they are above your head.
3. Lower them to the sides again.
Figure 9-7 shows pullovers. To do this exercise:
1. Lie on your back holding one dumbbell with both hands straight up
above your head.
2. Lower the dumbbell with your arms straight to the floor behind your
head.
3. Raise the dumbbell back above your head.
Older people in nursing homes who are given weights of just a few pounds
have shown excellent return of strength to what appeared to be atrophied
muscles. The benefits for you will be that much greater.

Chapter 9: Keeping It Moving: Exercise Plan

Weight training may be good for the days that you do not do your aerobic
exercise, or you can add it for a few minutes after you finish your activity.
Weight training is also good for working on a particular group of muscles that
you feel is weak. Very often, these muscles are in the back. Weight-training
exercises can isolate and strengthen each muscle.
If you do a lot of aerobic exercise that involves the legs, you may want to use
upper body weight training only. I can tell you from personal experience that
you not only feel a stronger upper body, but your ability to do your usual
exercise is enhanced as well.

Medications: What You 
Should Know
In This Chapter
 Taking pills to control blood glucose
 Using insulin
 Combining insulin and oral agents in type 2 diabetes
 Avoiding drug interactions
You don’t know how lucky you are (but I’m about to tell you). You are the
beneficiary of the greatest advances in diabetes medications in the his-
tory of the disease. From 1921, when insulin was isolated and used for the
first time, to 1955, when a class of glucose-lowering drugs called sulfonylureas
became available, insulin was the only option for treating diabetes. For another
40 years, nothing new showed up in the United States — until 1995. Now five
newer classes of drugs, each in its own way, lower blood glucose. In Chapter
16, I show you even more drug options that are coming soon.
Since the last edition of this book new medications have been introduced and
older medications have run into trouble. You will find the latest information
on all those changes in this chapter.
If you have diabetes and diet and exercise are not keeping your blood glucose
under control, you need to see your doctor about taking medication. In this
chapter, you find out all you need to know to use diabetes medications effec-
tively and safely. 
This chapter helps you become an educated consumer. Not only can you find
out about the medication you’re taking and how it works, but you discover
when to take it, how it interacts with other medications, what side effects it
may cause, and how to use several medications together, if necessary, to nor-
malize your glucose. Right now, today, you have all the tools needed to con-
trol your diabetes, and there is more to come. In the immortal words of the
great entertainer Al Jolson, “You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.”

Taking Drugs by Mouth: Oral Agents
For years, insulin shots were the only treatment available for diabetes. 
Most people do not care for shots. You may be an exception, but I doubt it.
Fortunately, drugs that can be taken by mouth have been available for some
time. One thing you should know about these pills: You can take them or
leave them, but they work much better if you take them.
Sulfonylureas
Scientists discovered sulfonylureas accidentally when they noticed that sol-
diers who were given certain sulfur-containing antibiotics developed symp-
toms of low blood glucose. When scientists began to search for the most
potent examples of this effect, they came up with several different versions of
this drug. Sulfonylureas all have the following characteristics:
 They work by making the pancreas release more insulin.
 They are not effective in type 1 diabetes where the pancreas is not capa-
ble of releasing any insulin.
 Sometimes they don’t work when first given (primary failure), but
almost always they stop working within a few years after you start them
(secondary failure). Sulfonylureas continue to be used because, for most
people, they improve glucose control for at least those first few years.
 They are all capable of causing hypoglycemia.
 When you use any of a class of antibiotics called sulfonamides, the 
glucose-lowering action of the sulfonylureas is prolonged.
 They should not be taken by a pregnant woman or a nursing mother.
 They can be fairly potent when given in combination with one of the
other classes of oral agents.
The original sulfonylureas from the 1950s, the first-generation sulfonylureas, are
not used as initial treatment as much anymore but are actually just as useful as
the newer, second-generation sulfonylureas. The old ones are just as potent, but
more milligrams are required for the same effect. All the first-generation drugs
are available in a generic form, which makes them less expensive. The first-
generation sulfonylureas include:
 Tolbutamide, brand name Orinase. This is the only short-acting sul-
fonylurea. Because it is rapidly broken down in the liver, tolbutamide
begins to work in one hour and is gone from the body in ten hours. It 
is available in 250 and 500 mg strength. Tolbutamide is usually given
before each meal, but some patients require only one or two doses a
196
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

day. Because it lasts for such a short time, tolbutamide is much safer in
elderly people. The maximal dose is 3 grams daily (six 500 mg pills).
 Tolazamide, brand name Tolinase. This agent is absorbed more slowly
than other sulfonylureas, so it takes 4 or more hours to notice its effects,
and its activity lasts up to 20 hours. Tolazamide is available in 100, 250,
and 500 mg. When more than 500 mg is needed, the dose is divided. The
maximum dose is 1,000 mg. This drug is changed in the liver, but the
new products produced by this change have the ability to lower the
blood glucose just like tolazamide. Because the new products are then
disposed of in the urine, a person with kidney disease should be careful
about taking this medication.
 Acetohexamide, brand name Dymelor. Acetohexamide begins to work
about 1 hour after it’s taken and lasts for 12 hours. It comes in 250 and
500 mg strength. Acetohexamide is given in one or two doses daily, and
the maximum useful dose is 1.5 grams (three 500 mg tablets).
Acetohexamide is inactivated and excreted just like tolazamide, so it
requires the same precautions askidney problems.
 Chlorpropamide, brand names Diabinase and Glucamide.
Chlorpropamide is the longest acting of the first-generation sulfony-
lureas and was responsible for many cases of hypoglycemia in the past.
It is active for 24 hours or longer. Chlorpropamide causes a very pro-
longed hypoglycemia that sometimes requires treatment with intra-
venous glucose for several days. It comes in 100 and 250 mg sizes. The
maximum recommended dose is 750 mg. It is broken down into other
chemicals, which are also active and are slowly eliminated in the urine,
so any kidney problem will greatly lengthen its time of activity. This drug
is taken only once a day because it lasts so long.
Chlorpropamide has several unique side effects. It causes water reten-
tion that sometimes results in low levels of sodium in the blood. If a
person on chlorpropamide drinks alcohol, his or her face flushes shortly
after taking the alcohol, lasting for ten minutes. Other sulfonylureas do
not cause this flushing.
In making a choice among the first-generation drugs, tolbutamide, acetohex-
amide, and tolazamide are considered less potent, and chlorpropamide is felt
to be the most potent. If the first three (of which tolbutamide is the mildest)
do not work, then chlorpropamide is tried. If chlorpropamide doesn’t lower
the blood glucose sufficiently, then the second-generation drugs are used.
Too often, doctors today do not try the first-generation drugs and go right to
the second-generation pills. For many people, the second-generation pills are
too potent, and hypoglycemia becomes a problem. For others, the second-
generation drugs provide no greater benefit than the earlier ones. All these
drugs — both first- and second-generation — suffer from the fact that, sooner
or later, they no longer control the blood glucose.
197
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

Three second-generation sulfonylureas now exist:
 Glyburide, brand names Micronase, Diabeta, and Glynase. Among the
foreign brand names for glyburide are Antibet, Azuglucon, Betanase,
Gliban, Glibil, Gluben, and Orabetic. Pretty confusing, huh? Glyburide
comes in 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg strengths. The usual starting dose is 2.5 to 
5 mg with breakfast, and the maintenance dose is 1.25 to 20 mg. Glyburide
leaves the body equally in the bowel movement and the urine, so
patients with either liver or kidney disease are at greater risk for low
blood glucose. Glyburide is carried around the bloodstream bound to
proteins, so if other drugs that bind to proteins are taken, such as
aspirin, the activity of glyburide may increase. When these drugs are
withdrawn, the activity of glyburide may decrease. Other than hypo-
glycemia, the incidence of negative effects is very low.
Glynase is a form of glyburide that is slightly more active because it is
absorbed better, so less is required for the same effect. The starting
dose is 1.5 mg, and it’s available in 1.5, 3, or 6 mg tablets with a maxi-
mum dose of 12 mg.
You can take either form of glyburide once a day in the morning, but
sometimes it works better when given twice a day.
 Glipizide, brand names Glucotrol and Glucotrol XL. Among the foreign
brand names are Digrin, Glibenase, Glican, Glyco, Glynase (which is the
same name as glyburide in the United States!), Mindiab, Napizide, and
Sucrazide. Glipizide is similar to glyburide but slightly less potent so
that it comes as 5 and 10 mg pills. You take it 30 minutes before food.
The starting dose is 5 mg. Up to 40 mg can be given daily in several
doses. Because it’s less potent, glipizide is preferred in the elderly.
Glucotrol XL is an extended release form of glipizide that lasts for 24
hours, so it usually is given as 5 or 10 mg once a day.
 Glimepiride, brand name Amaryl. This drug also lasts a longer time and
is fairly potent, so it is given once a day. It comes in 1, 2, and 4 mg sizes
with a maximum daily dose of 8 mg.
Choosing among the second-generation sulfonylureas, I generally select
glimepiride because of its long duration of action. However, the other two are
available as generic preparations and are, therefore, less expensive.
Metformin
Metformin, brand name Glucophage, is an entirely different kind of glucose-
lowering medication. Outside the United States, it’s called Benoformin,
198
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Dextin, Diabex, Diaformin, Fornidd, Glucoform, Gluformin, Metforal, Metomin,
and Orabet.
More than 20 years ago, the United States banned a sister medication called
phenformin because of an association with a fatal complication. Metformin
has been used in Europe for years without much trouble and was finally
approved in this country in 1995. Metformin is rarely, and perhaps never,
associated with the fatal complication lactic acidosis that caused phenformin
to be banned. A study reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine in November
2003 stated that no evidence exists to date that metformin therapy leads to
lactic acidosis.
Metformin has the following characteristics:
 It lowers the blood glucose mainly by reducing the production of glu-
cose from the liver (the hepatic glucose output).
 It works for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, because (unlike the sulfony-
lureas) it does not depend on stimulating insulin to work.
 Used by itself (monotherapy), it does not cause hypoglycemia.
 It may increase the sensitivity of the muscle cells to insulin and slow the
uptake of glucose from the intestine.
 It must be taken with food because it causes gastrointestinal irritation,
but this side effect declines with time.
 It’s available in 500 mg, 850 mg, and 1,000 mg tablets.
 A relatively inexpensive generic form is available, which is just as good
as any of the brand name forms.
 The maximum dose is 2,500 mg taken in divided doses with each meal.
 It’s often associated with weight loss, possibly from the gastrointestinal
irritation or because of a loss of taste for food.
 It’s not recommended when you have significant liver disease, kidney
disease, or heart failure.
 It’s usually stopped for a day or two before surgery or an x-ray study
using a dye.
 It’s not recommended for use in alcoholics.
 It’s not recommended for use in pregnancy or by a nursing mother.
 When given in combination with the sulfonylureas, hypoglycemia can
occur. If low blood glucose is persistent, the dose of sulfonylurea is
reduced.
199
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

Metformin can be a very useful drug, especially when fasting hyperglycemia
(high blood glucose upon awakening) is present. Metformin has some posi-
tive effects on the blood fats, causing a decrease in triglycerides and LDL
cholesterol and an increase in HDL cholesterol. About 10 percent of patients
fail to respond to it when it is first used, and the secondary failure rate is 5 to
10 percent a year. It occasionally causes a decrease in the absorption of vita-
min B12, a vitamin that is important for the blood and the nervous system.
Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of the brand name of metformin,
Glucophage, and other drug makers have come up with new preparations of
metformin, which, they believe, have some advantages over the original drug:
 Glucophage XR: The original preparation of metformin has to be taken
at each meal. Glucophage XR lasts for 24 hours and comes in a 500 mg
strength. Its longer lasting effects help overcome the problem of patients
not taking their medication the required multiple times a day. Glumetza
is the same drug by Biovail Phamaceuticals.
 Glucovance: This pill combines glyburide (a sulfonylurea described in
the previous section) with metformin at a dose of 250 or 500 mg. The
various combinations are 1.25 mg of glyburide with 250 mg metformin,
2.5 mg glyburide with 500 mg metformin, and 5 mg glyburide with 500
mg metformin. The advantage is the convenience of having to take only
one pill instead of two. Glyburide/metformin is the generic form.
 Metaglip: Made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, combines metformin 250 mg
and glipizide 2.5 mg. Glipazide/metformin is the generic form that also
comes in 500 mg/5 mg.
 Avandamet: This drug is a combination of 4 mg of Avandia (which I
describe in the section “Rosiglitazone,” later in this chapter) and 500 mg
of metformin. This is a potent combination of two drugs that act differ-
ently to improve insulin sensitivity. Avandia has been associated with
increased heart attacks. I do not recommend this combination.
 ACTOsplus Met: Combines 500 or 850 mg metformin with 15 mg Actos,
discussed under the section “Pioglitazone.” It is made by Takeda.
 Janumet: Combines 500 or 1000 mg metformin with 50 mg sitagliptin, a
member of a new class of drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors (see below). It is
made by Merck.
In my experience, the combination drugs work better than giving two drugs
separately. This may reflect the greater compliance that results when a single
pill is given compared to two separate pills. If you are already taking both of
the drugs separately that are available in a combination pill, ask your doctor
about getting the single pill that contains both.

Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors
These are drugs that block the action of an enzyme in the intestine that
breaks down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars that can be absorbed.
Taking alpha-glucosidase inhibitors results in a slowing of the rise in glucose
after meals. The carbohydrates are eventually broken down by bacteria lower
down in the intestine, producing a lot of gas, abdominal pain, and diarrhea —
the main drawbacks of these drugs.
There are two alpha-glucosidase inhibitors currently being used:
 Acarbose, brand name Precose. This drug seems to have much greater
popularity in Europe than it does in the United States. It was the first
alpha-glucosidase inhibitor on the market. Its main characteristics are
• It’s supplied in 25, 50, and 100 mg strengths.
• The recommended starting dose is 25 mg at the beginning of each
meal. This dose can be increased to 50 or 100 mg three times daily,
depending on the blood glucose. The highest dose is not given
unless the patient weighs more than 130 pounds.
• It does not require insulin for its activity, so it works for both type
1 and type 2 diabetes.
• It does not cause hypoglycemia when used alone but does in com-
bination with sulfonylureas. If hypoglycemia is persistent, the dose
of sulfonylurea is decreased.
• It should not be used by people with intestinal disease.
• Many people do not like it because of the gastrointestinal effects.
• The lowering of glucose and hemoglobin A1c is modest at most.
 Miglitol, brand name Glyset. This was the second alpha-glucosidase
inhibitor introduced. Its characteristics are identical to acarbose. It
comes in 25, 50, and 100 mg. Curiously, the manufacturer is the same for
both drugs: Bayer.
Because these drugs block the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, 
hypoglycemia occurring with acarbose or miglitol and sulfonylurea combi-
nations must be treated with a preparation of glucose, not more complex 
carbohydrates.
In my own practice, I have not found a use for either drug. I tried acarbose 
on a number of patients, and even though they started at a low dose and
gradually built up to a more effective level, they complained about the gas
and abdominal pain and asked me to take them off the drug. Because I was
201
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

not seeing much change in the blood glucose, I did not object. I see no reason
to expect that miglitol would be any different.
Thiazolidinediones (the glitazones)
This is the first group of drugs for diabetes that directly reverses insulin
resistance.
Troglitazone
Troglitazone, brand name Rezulin (called Prelay outside the United States),
was the first oral agent for type 2 diabetes that actually reversed the basic
lesion in this disease, namely the insulin resistance. It does this by causing
changes within the muscle and fat cells where the insulin resistance resides.
These changes take several weeks to occur, and if the patient stops taking
troglitazone, they take several weeks to subside.
In March 2000, because of continuing occurrences of severe liver disease
sometimes leading to death in a small number of patients taking troglitazone,
the FDA removed troglitazone from the market. The other glitazone drugs
currently on the market — rosiglitazone and pioglitazone — have not had
this problem, although the FDA requires monitoring the patient’s liver func-
tion when these drugs are first used.
Rosiglitazone
Rosiglitazone was the second thiazolidinedione to be approved by the FDA. It
is marketed by Glaxo SmithKline as Avandia. The characteristics of rosiglita-
zone are:
 It’s available as 2, 4, and 8 mg tablets.
 Tablets are taken with or without food once a day.
 The recommended starting dose is 4 mg, and 8 mg is the maximum rec-
ommended dose. Increases in the dose are made no more often than
every two to four weeks. Rosiglitazone may take three months or longer
to have its maximum effect.
 Because it improves insulin resistance, this drug has its greatest effect
on the blood glucose after eating, rather than the first morning glucose.
 By itself, rosiglitazone does not cause hypoglycemia. It results in hypo-
glycemia only when combined with insulin or sulfonylurea.
 If rosiglitazone is given to a patient on sulfonylurea or metformin, those
drugs must not be stopped when the rosiglitazone is started because it
takes so long for the rosiglitazone to begin to work.
202
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

 Rosiglitazone is insulin-sparing, meaning the body does not have to make
as much insulin to control blood glucose when this drug is given.
 The drug is eliminated from the body almost entirely through the
bowels, so no adjustment of the dose is needed when the kidneys are
poorly functioning.
So far, secondary failure, where the drug works initially but stops working
later, does not seem to be a problem. A major advantage is that rosiglitazone
needs to be taken only once a day, which greatly helps with one of the major
problems in all medicine, namely compliance.
However, rosiglitazone does have some problems:
 Although rosiglitazone has not been shown to cause severe liver
damage, the FDA requires that liver testing be done before starting treat-
ment, every two months for the first year, and periodically thereafter. If
the specific liver test called ALT rises more than three times the upper
limit of normal, the drug must be stopped. So far, I have had no such
problem after treating several hundred patients with this drug.
 Rosiglitazone causes water retention and swelling of the ankles, espe-
cially in the older population, which some people do not find tolerable.
Occasionally the drug is stopped for this reason. This water retention
may also be responsible for a mild decrease in red blood cells called
anemia. The drug should not be used in people with heart failure.
 It should not be taken during pregnancy or by a nursing mother.
Rosiglitazone has been associated with an increased incidence of heart
attacks. I do not recommend it. I have switched all my patients on roziglita-
zone to pioglitazone or other drugs.
Rosiglitazone has been found to have unexpected effects in women of child-
bearing age — specifically, unintended pregnancies due to improved fertility.
Many women with type 2 diabetes have reduced fertility as a result of insulin
resistance. When these women take rosiglitazone, their fertility may improve,
and they may become pregnant.
Pioglitazone
Pioglitazone, manufactured by Eli Lilly and Takeda in the United States, was
the third thiazolidinedione to come to market. The brand name is Actos, and
its properties are the same as rosiglitazone with the following differences:
 The initial dose is 15 mg once a day with or without food, but most
patients require 30 or even 45 mg. It comes in all three sizes.
 In addition to restoring fertility in some women who are infertile due to
insulin resistance, pioglitazone reduces estrogen levels in women taking
203
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

estrogen and may result in making hormone-based contraception, such
as the Pill or Depo-Provera, less effective.
 Pioglitazone has been shown to reduce bad (LDL) cholesterol particles
in people with or without diabetes (as reported in Diabetes Care,
September 2003).
 Pioglitazone has been shown to be associated with increased osteoporo-
sis in women.
 Pioglitazone has not been shown to be associated with a higher inci-
dence of heart attacks.
 It is authorized for use alone, with insulin, with metformin, or with a 
sulfonylurea.
Pioglitazone 30 mg has been combined with glimepiride 2 or 4 mg in a pill
called Duetact made by Takeda.
Meglitinides
Each of these drugs, although they are chemically somewhat different, has
about the same activity. They are chemically unrelated to the sulfonylureas but
work by squeezing more insulin out of the pancreas just like the sulfonylureas
do. They are taken just before meals to stimulate insulin for only that meal.
There are two drugs in this class:
 Repaglinide, brand name Prandin. This was the first meglitinide. The
characteristics of repaglinide include:
• It is available as 0.5, 1, and 2 mg tablets and is taken just before or
up to 30 minutes before meals.
• The starting dose is 0.5 mg with a mild elevation of blood glucose
or 1 or 2 mg if the initial blood glucose is higher. The dose may be
doubled once a week to a maximum of 4 mg before meals.
• Because it acts through insulin, repaglinide can cause hypoglycemia.
• It’s not recommended in pregnancy or for nursing mothers.
• It’s not used with the sulfonylureas but can be combined with 
metformin. Use in combination with rosiglitazone has not been
studied.
• Repaglinide lowers the blood glucose and the hemoglobin A1c
effectively when used in combination with metformin.
204
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

• It’s mostly broken down in the liver and leaves the body in the
bowel movement. Therefore, if liver disease is present, the dose
has to be adjusted downward.
• Despite the lack of excretion through the kidneys, increases in the
dose have to be made more carefully when kidney impairment is
present.
Experience with repaglinide has shown that it causes no problems when
given with nondiabetes medications. It’s bound to protein in the blood,
so medications like aspirin (which also bind to protein) may, theoreti-
cally, increase its activity. I have not seen this as a problem with my
patients who are on this medication.
 Nateglinide, brand name Starlix. This drug is very similar to repaglinide
in its activity. However, it comes in 60 and 120 mg sizes. The starting
dose is usually 120 mg before each meal; if a meal is skipped, no dose is
taken. If hypoglycemia occurs, the dose is lowered to 60 mg. The features
of repaglinide also apply to nateglinide, other than the dosage. A report
in Diabetes Care in July 2003 showed that repaglinide combined with met-
formin is a more potent combination than nateglinide with metformin.
DPP-4 inhibitors
This new class of drugs has a different mechanism from any of the previous
classes of oral agents. There is a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) which is made in the small intestine and has a number of positive
effects for people with diabetes:
 It slows the movement of food in the intestine.
 It reduces the production of glucagon from the pancreas. Glucagon
raises the blood glucose.
 It increases insulin levels.
 It decreases food intake leading to weight loss.
 It normalizes the blood glucose in many patients.
The only problem with GLP-1 is that it’s rapidly broken down by an enzyme
called DPP-4. Therefore, under usual circumstances, GLP-1 is not around long
enough to have these effects in a major way.
This class of drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors block the rapid breakdown of GLP-
1 and prolong its actions. There are currently two DPP-4 inhibitors, only one
of which is available for patients:
205
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

 Sitagliptin: This drug has the brand name Januvia, is made by Merck
and comes in 25, 50 and 100 mg. The dose is 100 mg daily. Since it is
excreted by the kidneys, people with kidney disease must take lower
doses. It can cause stomach discomfort. 
The problem with sitagliptin is that the amount of lowering of the hemo-
globin A1c is less than 1 percent. In addition, it does not result in weight
loss, which, I believe is the major advantage of GLP-1. Finally, it has been
tested in only a few thousand patients. We don’t know what unexpected
side effects will show themselves once millions of people start to use it.
Therefore, I am using it sparingly if at all in my practice until we know
more about it, particularly since it doesn’t have a major effect on blood
glucose.
 Vidagliptin: This drug with the brand name Galvus is very similar in its
effects to sitagliptin. It has not yet been authorized for sale by the FDA.
It is made by Novartis.
Combining oral agents
Taking one oral agent alone often does not control the blood glucose suffi-
ciently to prevent complications of diabetes. (A hemoglobin A1c of less than
7 percent is the goal; see Chapter 7.) In this section, I explain how you can
use two or more of these drugs together.
You should never take a drug, or a combination of drugs, as a convenient way
of avoiding the basic diet and exercise that are the keys to diabetic control.
(See Chapters 8 and 9 for more information on these crucial points.)
I currently start all new type 2 patients who are mildly out of control onpiogli-
tazone. I give this medication at least eight weeks to work. Many patients
need no more treatment than this in addition to their diet and exercise. I usu-
ally begin with a 15 mg dose and increase to 30 mg if the blood glucose is still
elevated after four weeks. I check liver function before starting this drug and
every two months thereafter.
If 30 mg of pioglizone does not control the patient’s blood glucose, it’s often
the first morning glucose that is still elevated — the fasting blood glucose.
Metformin is an excellent second drug to add at this point, usually at a dose
of 500 mg with breakfast and supper, but most patients need 1,000 mg twice
daily to achieve sufficient glucose reduction. Several articles in the medical
literature have shown that the combination of pioglitazone and metformin is
highly effective and safe.
When a patient is taking these two drugs but still has slightly elevated blood
glucose, I add a sulfonylurea. I like to use a longer-acting form, such as
glimepiride, because I always prefer a drug that can be taken only once a day
206
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

to drugs that require multiple dosing. That’s one of the reasons I like pioglita-
zone so much, in addition to its effectiveness. I have found that 2 to 4 mg of
glimepiride combined with the other drugs is all the treatment needed to
achieve the goal.
A few patients will still have elevated blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c
levels, even with the preceding treatments. For them, repaglinide in place of
the sulfonylurea usually does the trick. Starting with a dosage of 1 mg before
each meal, those patients have found this medication to be very helpful.
If low blood glucose starts to be a problem, the dose of the sulfonylurea or
repaglinide is lowered because the other medications are not responsible for
hypoglycemia.
Many diabetes specialists believe that the pancreas gradually fails to make
insulin in type 2 diabetes and that most patients need to take insulin sooner
or later (see the sidebar “Combining insulin and oral agents in type 2 dia-
betes”). My experience is that this is not necessarily true and that the
modern medications, particularly the glitazones and metformin, can delay or
eliminate the need for insulin. Certainly, numerous people with diabetes are
well controlled with only a small dose of an oral medication. And I have seen
many others who used insulin when nothing else was available but have
since stopped taking it and do not appear as though they will ever need it
again. Some people need no drugs at all.
New injectable drugs
The discussion of DPP-4 inhibitors mentioned that these drugs work by
blocking the breakdown of the natural hormone GLP-1. Amylin Pharmaceuticals
and Eli Lilly have been able to extract a substance from the venom of a lizard
called the Gila Monster that acts like GLP-1 but does not break down nearly
as fast, which they call exenatide. They have also been able to produce a
second injectable substance called pramlintide with many similar properties.
Exenatide
Exenatide, which the companies call Byetta, is a powerful form of GLP-1 that
lasts for several hours. It is taken within an hour before breakfast and supper.
It may only be used in type 2 diabetes and comes in vials containing either 
5 or 10 micrograms per dose. It may be used with metformin, a sulfonylurea
or pioglitazone or combinations of those drugs. It can sometimes cause sub-
stantial weight loss and eliminate the need for all of those drugs. It is associ-
ated with nausea and, rarely, can’t be used because the nausea is so severe.
Hypoglycemia is frequent when it is used with a sulfonylurea. At present it is
not supposed to be used with insulin.
207
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

A long-acting version of Byetta is soon to be available. It will require taking
only one shot a week. Studies have shown it controls glucose even better
than twice daily Byetta.
This drug has proved to be very valuable in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
It is sometimes necessary to use more than the maximum recommended
dose of 20 micrograms a day.
Pramlintide
Pramlintide (brand name Symlin) is an extract from the same beta cells of the
pancreas that produce insulin. It has a number of valuable properties for type
1 and type 2 diabetes. Among them are:
 It blocks the secretion of glucagon, a major hormone that tends to raise
blood glucose (see Chapter 2 for details).
 It slows the emptying of the stomach so that glucose is absorbed more
slowly.
 It causes loss of appetite and weight loss.
Amylin, therefore, has an important effect on the rate at which glucose
appears in the blood after eating. These effects occur when amylin reaches
certain centers in the brain.
Because amylin comes from the same cells that make insulin, it’s absent in
type 1 diabetes just as insulin is absent in type 1 diabetes. It was thought that
providing amylin to a patient with T1DM may improve the blood glucose.
However, naturally occurring amylin has chemical properties that make it
unusable as a pill or an injection. Mainly, it couldn’t be made to dissolve in
any liquid. A small change in the chemical structure made it possible to dis-
solve the new chemical while retaining all the properties of amylin. 
Pramlintide is taken before meals that contain at least 30 grams of carbohy-
drate or 250 kilocalories. It does not mix with insulin. Since pramlintide is so
potent, the insulin dose must be reduced by half. It can cause nausea and
hypoglycemia.
The starting dose of pramlintide is 15 micrograms before meals and this is
increased by 15 micrograms every 3 days. The maximum daily total dose is
120 micrograms.
Pramlintide has not been studied in pregnancy and while breast feeding so it
should not be used for these conditions. Children may use it.
You should probably not use pramlintide if you have hypoglycemia unaware-
ness (see Chapter 4) or a form of diabetic neuropathy called gastroparesis
(see Chapter 5), which makes the stomach empty slowly.

Insulin
If you have type 1 diabetes, insulin is your savior. If you have type 2 diabetes,
you may need insulin late in the course of your disease. Insulin is a great
drug, but most people take it through a needle, and that is the rub (or the
pain). Inventors have come up with many different ways to administer
insulin, but using a syringe and a needle has been the standard for so long
that most patients continue to do so. In this section, I tell you about the
newer methods, which you should at least consider because they are easier
and possibly more accurate than the old method. However, the new syringes
and needles are just about painless.
Until a few years ago, insulin could be obtained only by extracting it from the
pancreas of a cow, pig, salmon, or some other animal. This was not entirely
satisfactory because those insulins are slightly different from human insulin.
Using them resulted in an immune reaction in the blood and certain skin reac-
tions. The preparation was purified, but tiny amounts of impurities always
remained. In 1978, researchers were able to trick bacteria called E coli into
making human insulin. Almost all insulin is now perfectly pure human insulin.
Soon, no insulin besides human insulin will be available.
Previously, insulin came in two different strengths, U40 and U80, which meant
40 units per milliliter or 80 units per milliliter. This was confusing, especially
if the wrong syringe was used — you had to use a U40 syringe for U40 insulin.
To eliminate confusion, all insulin in the United States is now U100 or 100
units per milliliter, and all syringes are U100 syringes. This standardization
does not necessarily apply in Europe or elsewhere, so check the insulin
strength and the markings on the syringe.
In the human body, insulin is constantly responding to ups and downs in the
blood glucose. No simple device is currently available to measure the blood
glucose and give insulin as the pancreas does. In order to avoid having to
take many shots a day, forms of insulin were invented to work at different
times. These forms of insulin include:
 Rapid-acting lispro insulin: Lispro insulin (called Humalog insulin by its
manufacturer, Eli Lilly) begins to lower the glucose within five minutes
after its administration, peaks at about one hour, and is no longer active
by about three hours. Lispro is a great advance because it frees the
person with diabetes to take a shot just when he or she eats. With the
previous short-acting insulin (regular insulin), a person had to take a
shot and eat within 30 minutes or hypoglycemia might occur. Because
its activity begins and ends so quickly, lispro does not cause hypo-
glycemia as often as the older preparations.
Novo Nordisk has come out with insulin aspart (called NovoLog), which
has characteristics indistinguishable from lispro insulin.
209
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

Sanofi-Aventis produces insulin glulisine (called Apidra), which is similar
in its properties to the other two rapid-acting insulins.
 Short-acting regular insulin: Regular insulin takes 30 minutes to start to
lower the glucose, peaks at 3 hours, and is gone by 6 to 8 hours. Until
Humalog, NovoLog, and Apidra came along, patients used this prepara-
tion before meals to keep their glucose low until the next meal.
 Intermediate-acting NPH or Lente insulins: Both begin to lower the 
glucose within 2 hours of administration and continue their activity for
10 to 12 hours. They can be active for up to 24 hours. The purpose of
this kind of insulin is to provide a smooth level of control over half the
day so that a low level of active insulin is always in the body. This
attempts to parallel the situation that exists in the human body.
 Long-acting Ultralente insulin: This insulin begins to act within 6 hours
and provides a low level of insulin activity for up to 26 hours. It was
invented to provide a smooth, basal level of control requiring only one
shot a day. It can act differently in different people, looking more like
intermediate insulin in some patients. 
 Long-acting insulin glargine and detemir: Aventis sells an insulin called
insulin glargine or Lantus. Studies have shown that insulin glargine has
its onset in 1 to 2 hours after injection, and its activity lasts for 24 hours
without a specific peak time of activity, which is exactly what is needed
to control the blood glucose over an entire day. Insulin glargine is released
in a smooth fashion from the site of injection, and it doesn’t matter what
part of the body is injected. Because of its smooth and predictable activ-
ity, insulin glargine does not tend to cause low blood glucose at night,
which often happens with NPH insulin. I have used this insulin in a number
of my patients with type 1 diabetes and have been extremely pleased
with the results. I now use it with all new type 1 diabetes patients. One
disadvantage of insulin glargine is that it can’t be mixed with other
insulins in one syringe.
Insulin detemir or Levemir has similar properties to glargine but does
not last quite as long. It is a product of Novo Nordisk.
If you do not have good diabetic control (defined as hemoglobin A1c of 
7 percent or less) with NPH insulin, ask your doctor to consider using
insulin glargine or detemir.
 Premixed insulins: Several mixtures are available: one with 70 percent
NPH insulin and 30 percent regular; one with a 50–50 mix of NPH and 
regular; one with a 75–25 mix of NPH-like insulin and lispro insulin; 
and one with a 70–30 mix of NPH-like insulin and insulin aspart. These
insulins are helpful for people who have trouble mixing insulins in one
syringe, have poor eyesight, or are stable on a preparation that does 
not change.
210
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

You need to know a few things that are common to all insulins:
 Insulin may be kept at room temperature for four weeks or in the refrig-
erator until the expiration date printed on the label. After four weeks at
room temperature, the insulin should be discarded.
 Insulin does not take too well to excessive heat, such as direct sunlight,
or excessive cold. Protect your insulin against these conditions.
 You can safely give an insulin shot through clothing.
 If you take less than 50 units in a shot, there are 1⁄2 cc syringes that make
it easy to measure up to 50 units. If you take less than 30 units, you can
use 3⁄10 cc syringes.
 Shorter needles may be more comfortable, especially for children, but
the depth of the injection helps to determine how fast the insulin works.
 You can reuse disposable syringes a couple of times.
 Used syringes and needles must be disposed of in a puncture-proof con-
tainer that is sealed shut before being placed in the trash.
211
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know
Combining insulin and oral agents 
in type 2 diabetes
Sometimes the characteristics of the currently
available oral agents do not provide the tight
control needed to avoid complications. This is
particularly true after many years of type 2 dia-
betes. Then insulin may be required. Insulin may
be added in a number of ways, but often a shot
of glargine insulin at bedtime is all that is needed
to start the day under control and continue it with
oral agents. For example, pioglitazone may con-
trol the daytime glucoses very well after eating,
but the first morning glucose may need the
overnight shot of glargine insulin. By gradually
increasing the dose of glargine, most patients
with type 2 diabetes on oral agents can be con-
trolled so that their hemoglobin A1c is 7 or below.
As type 2 diabetes progresses, the oral agents
may be less effective, and insulin is taken more
often. Two shots a day of intermediate and
short-acting insulin may do the trick. Usually
you take two-thirds of the dose in the morning
and one-third before supper because you need
short-acting insulin to control the supper car-
bohydrates. This is a situation where 75 percent
protamine lispro (like NPH) and 25 percent
lispro insulin may be useful, allowing the patient
to measure from only one bottle. This combina-
tion is especially valuable in the older person
with diabetes, where the tightest level of con-
trol is not being sought because the expected
lifespan of the patient is shorter than the time
necessary to develop complications. In this
patient, doctors want to prevent problems like
frequent urination leading to loss of sleep or
vaginal infections, so they give enough to treat
this but not so much that a frail, elderly patient
is having hypoglycemia on a frequent basis.

Shooting yourself
Whatever type of insulin you use, chances are you’ll be taking it by syringe
and needle. (I discuss other delivery options later in the chapter, in the sec-
tions “Delivering insulin with a pen,” “Delivering insulin with a jet injection
device,” and “Delivering insulin with an external pump.”)
Drawing insulin up is done in the same way no matter which type of insulin is
involved. If you look at the syringe in Figure 10-1, you see that it’s lined.
Starting at the needle end of the syringe, you’ll find nine small lines above the
needle, followed by a tenth longer line where the number 10 may be found.
Each line is one unit of insulin. Above the 10-unit line, you’ll find a succession
of four small lines followed by a larger line representing 15, 20, 25, and so on.
If the insulin is lispro or regular, it should be clear and you do not have to
shake the bottle. The other kinds of insulin are cloudy, and you need to shake
the bottle a few times to suspend the tiny particles in the liquid. A new bottle
has a cap on the top, which you break off and discard. When you’re ready to
take insulin, wipe the rubber stopper in the top of the bottle with alcohol.
Pull up the number of units of air that corresponds to the number of units of
insulin you need to take. Turn the insulin bottle upside down and penetrate
the rubber stopper with the needle of the syringe. Push all the air inside and
pull out the insulin dose you need. Because air replaces the insulin, the pres-
sure inside the bottle is unchanged, and no vacuum is created. Check to
make sure that you have the right amount of the right insulin and no air bub-
bles in the syringe.
To give the injection, use alcohol to wipe off an area of skin on your arm,
chest, stomach, or wherever you’re injecting it. Insert the needle at a right
angle to the skin and push it in. When the needle has penetrated the skin,
push the plunger of the syringe down to zero to administer the insulin.
Figure 10-1:
The insulin
syringe and
bottle.
212
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

If you’re taking two kinds of insulin at the same time (but not insulin
glargine), you can mix them in one syringe, thus avoiding two shots. Here’s
how you do that:
1. Wipe both bottles with alcohol.
2. Draw up the total units of air corresponding to the total insulin you
need.
3. Push the units of air into the longer-acting insulin bottle that corre-
sponds to the number of units of longer-acting insulin you need, and
withdraw the needle.
4. Push the rest of the units of air into the shorter-acting insulin bottle,
and withdraw the correct units of insulin.
5. Go back to the longer-acting bottle and withdraw the correct units of
insulin from there.
By doing this, you do not contaminate the shorter-acting insulin with the
additive in the longer-acting insulin.
213
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know
Carbohydrate counting to maximum health
To find out how you can accomplish carbohy-
drate counting in everyday life, take a typical
type 1 patient. Salvatore Law is a 41-year-old
who has had type 1 diabetes for 31 years. He
has been well controlled because he follows a
good diet, does lots of exercise, and takes his
insulin appropriately. He takes 30 units of insulin
glargine at bedtime.
Law has a list of dosages of lispro insulin that
tells him to take 1 unit of insulin for each 20
grams of carbohydrate he eats. He is about to
have breakfast and knows that it will contain 80
grams of carbohydrate. Therefore, he needs
four units of lispro insulin. He measures his
blood glucose before breakfast and finds that it
is 202 mg/dl. His doctor has told him to take an
extra unit of lispro insulin for each 50 mg/dl
above 100 mg/dl. He adds two more units for a
total of six units of insulin taken just before
breakfast.
At lunch, his blood glucose measures 58. He is
about to have a lunch of 120 grams of carbohy-
drate, so he needs 6 units for that. However, he
reduces it by 1 unit for the glucose measure-
ment that is approximately 50 mg/dl lower than
100, so his final dose is 5 units.
Before supper, Law’s blood glucose measures
120. His supper contains only 60 grams of car-
bohydrate, so he needs 3 units for that. He does
not have to adjust the dose because the glu-
cose is close to 100, so he takes only 3 units.
At bedtime, his blood glucose is 108, so he is
doing very well. Unless the blood glucose is 200
or greater, he does not need to take any bedtime
lispro because he is taking insulin glargine to
control his glucose overnight.

Where you inject the insulin helps determine how fast it works. Insulin
injected into the abdomen is most rapidly absorbed, followed by the arms
and legs and then the buttocks. You may use these differing rates of uptake of
the insulin to get faster action when your blood glucose is high. If the body
part that gets the insulin is exercised, the insulin enters more quickly. If you
use the same injection site repeatedly, the absorption rate slows down, so
rotate the sites.
The timing of your insulin injections helps to determine the smoothness of
your glucose control. The more regular you are in your injections, your
eating, and your exercise, the smoother your glucose level.
Conducting intensive insulin treatment
Intensive insulin treatment is essential in type 1 diabetes if you hope to pre-
vent the complications of the disease. This means measuring your blood glu-
cose at least before each meal and at bedtime, plus using both short-acting
and longer-acting insulin to keep the blood glucose between 80 and 100
before meals and less than 140 after eating. How you do this is the subject of
this section.
In a person who doesn’t have type 1 diabetes, a small amount of circulating
insulin is always present in the bloodstream and, after eating, insulin increases
temporarily to control the glucose in the meal. Intensive insulin treatment
attempts to mirror the activity of the normal human pancreas as much as
possible.
In intensive insulin treatment, you usually take a certain amount of longer-
acting insulin at bedtime. I prefer insulin glargine because it produces a
smooth basal level of glucose control over 24 hours. In addition, you take a
dose of rapid-acting insulin before each meal. I prefer lispro because it is
more convenient and less hypoglycemia occurs. The dose of lispro is deter-
mined by the expected grams of carbohydrates in the meal you’re about to
eat, as well as by your blood glucose at that moment. Your doctor should
provide you with a list of how much insulin to take for a given situation. Each
patient is different, and the dosage must be individualized.
Using the carbohydrates in a meal to determine your insulin dose is called
carbohydrate counting. The key to this system is to know the carbohydrates in
your food. Here is where you make use of your friendly dietitian, who can go
over your food preferences and show you how many carbohydrates are in
them. The dietitian can also show you where to find carbohydrate counts for
any other foods that you might eat.
214
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

You also need to know how many grams of carbohydrate are controlled by
each unit of insulin you take. This is determined by checking your blood glu-
cose an hour after eating a known amount of carbohydrate. For example, one
person may need 1 unit to control 20 grams of carbohydrate, while another
person needs 1 unit to control 15 grams of carbohydrate. If both of them eat a
breakfast of 75 grams of carbohydrate, the first person might take 4 units of
lispro, while the second person takes 5 units of lispro. Then additional units
are added for the amount that the blood glucose needs to be lowered. A typi-
cal schedule is to take 1 unit for every 50 mg/dl that the blood glucose is
above 100 mg/dl. Insulin can also be subtracted if the blood glucose is too
low. For every 50 mg/dl that the glucose is below 100, subtract 1 unit. (To see
how carbohydrate counting works in practice, see the sidebar “Carbohydrate
counting to maximum health.”)
By measuring your blood glucose frequently, you can find out how different
carbohydrates affect your blood glucose. By using the carbohydrate sources
that have a low glycemic index, you will need to use less insulin to control
them. (See Chapter 8 for more on carbohydrates.)
As you attempt to help your body mirror normal insulin and glucose dynam-
ics, you often have to deal with a greater frequency of hypoglycemia. The
best way to handle hypoglycemia is by eating slightly smaller meals and
using the unused calories as between-meal snacks. This technique smoothes
out the ups and downs.
At what point do you adjust your insulin glargine? If you find that several
mornings in a row your fasting blood glucose is too high, you might add a
unit or two to your bedtime glargine. If it’s too low, you might reduce your
insulin glargine by a unit or two or try eating a small bedtime snack. A high
blood glucose level throughout the day is an indication to raise the glargine.
Getting a lot of hypoglycemia at different times of day is a reason to lower the
glargine. These adjustments are best done in consultation with your doctor.
If, however, you’re unable to see your doctor, you can put your knowledge to
use and make these adjustments on your own.
Adjusting insulin when you travel
If you’re traveling between time zones, you may wonder if you need to
change your insulin routine while you’re gone. Time changes of less than
three hours require no modifications, but changes above three hours require
progressively more. You should probably discuss these changes with your
physician before you go.
215
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

Say that you’re taking the red-eye flight at 10 p.m. from San Francisco, arriv-
ing at 6 a.m. at Kennedy Airport in New York. If you are taking insulin glargine,
you do not have to change your dose. Just start using lispro at the beginning
of your meals (which you’ll be eating three hours earlier than usual because
of the time change).
When you return to California, you add three hours to your day. In this case,
you need to take an extra measurement of your blood glucose. If it’s around
150, you need do nothing, but if it’s 200 or more, take a couple of units of
lispro insulin to bring it down. If your blood glucose is much below 100, eat a
small snack. Again, you do not have to adjust your insulin glargine.
Delivering insulin with a pen
Several manufacturers, including Eli Lilly, Owen Mumford, Diesetronic, Novo
Nordisk, Sanofi-Aventis, and Becton Dickinson, have sought ways to make
delivering insulin easier. The insulin pen, shown in Figure 10-2, is one useful
tool. The pen doesn’t eliminate the need for needles, but it does change the
way you measure your insulin. Either the pen comes with an insulin cartridge
already inserted, or the cartridge is placed inside the pen just like ink car-
tridges used to be put in pens and replaced when it runs out.
Each cartridge contains 1.5 or 3.0 milliliters of insulin — either NPH, regular,
lispro, aspart, a mixture of NPH-like lispro and lispro (such as 75 percent
NPH-like lispro and 25 percent lispro), or a mixture of NPH-like aspart plus
aspart. You can then dial the amount of insulin that you need to take. Each
unit (sometimes two units) is accompanied by a clicking sound so the visu-
ally impaired can hear the number of units. The units also appear in a window
on the pen. If you draw up too many units, one of the pens forces you to
waste the insulin by pushing it out of the needle, while others allow you to
reset the pen and start again. Depending on the pen, you can deliver from 
30 to 70 units of insulin. You screw on a new needle as needed.
Figure 10-2:

Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

A number of different companies make pens for their own insulin. Available
pens include the following:
 Autopen, which is available in four different models. Two contain a 1.5-ml
cartridge, and two contain a 3-ml cartridge. Within each size, one pen
delivers insulin in 1-unit increments, and the other pen delivers insulin
in 2-unit increments.
 Humalog Mix 75/25, Humalog Mix 50/50, Humalog Pen, Humulin Mix
70/30, and Humulin N, all of which are prefilled, disposable pens contain-
ing 3 ml of the particular kind of insulin you use.
 HumaPen Luxura HD, used for Humalog insulin when half-unit doses are
needed, particularly in children.
 HumaPen Memoir, a new pen that remembers the 16 most recent doses,
their times, and dates; and is used with 3-ml lispro cartridges.
 Levemir FlexPen, a prefilled disposable pen containing 3 ml of Levemir
insulin.
 NovoLog FlexPen and NovoLog 70/30 FlexPen, which are prefilled dis-
posable insulin syringes containing 3 ml of insulin.
 NovoPen Junior, which takes NovoLog cartridges containing 3 ml of
insulin and can be measured in half-unit doses.
 NovoPen 3, which holds NovoLog 3-ml cartridges.
 SoloStar, a disposable pen that contains 3 ml of Lantus insulin.
 Opticlix, which uses 3 ml glargine or glulisine cartridges.
Insulin pens require needles, and you must match the pen with the proper
needle in order for the pen to work properly. If the needles don’t come with
the pen, the instructions with the pen tell you which needle to use.
Should you shift from your syringe and needle to a pen? If you’re comfortable
with the syringe and needle and feel your technique is accurate, you proba-
bly have no reason to do so. If you’re new to insulin, have some visual impair-
ment, or feel that you’re not getting an accurate measurement of the insulin,
a pen may be the solution for you.
Delivering insulin with 
a jet injection device
Jet injection devices (see Figure 10-3) are for the person who just can’t stick a
needle into his or her skin. At around $1,000 or more, they’re expensive, but
they last a long time and replace the syringe and needle.
217
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

Jet injection devices are made by at least two different manufacturers:
 Advanta Jet, which delivers 1⁄2 to 50 units of all types and mixes of insulin
 Advanta Jet ES, which is useful when the skin is particularly tough
 Adveanta Jet’s Gentle Jet, which is a low-power version for children of
the two Advanta Jet 
 Medi-Jector Vision, which delivers all types of insulin from 2 to 50 units
in 1-unit increments
A large quantity of insulin is taken into the injection device, enough for multi-
ple treatments. The amount of insulin to be delivered is measured, usually by
rotating one part of the device while the number of units to be delivered
appears in a window. The device is held against the skin. With the press of a
button, a powerful jet of air forces the insulin through the skin into the sub-
cutaneous tissue, usually with no pain perceived by the patient. The devices
come in a lower power form for smaller children. These devices can deliver
up to 50 units at one time.
Should you try an insulin jet injector? If you have no trouble with the syringe
and needle or find the pen to be an easy substitute, you don’t need a jet injec-
tor. If you hate needles or need to give frequent shots to a small child who is
very resistant to them, a jet injector may solve your problems.
Delivering insulin with an external pump
For some people — and you may be one of them — the external insulin pump
(see Figure 10-4) is the answer to their prayers. These devices are as close 
as you currently can come to the gradual administration of rapid-acting
insulin that is normally taking place in the body. They’re expensive, cost-
ing more than $4,000, but the insulin pump may be the answer for patients
who simply cannot achieve good glucose control with syringes, pens, or jet
injectors.

Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Currently, five companies — Animas, DANA Diabecare, Deltec, Medtronic
MiniMed, and Nipro Diabetes Systems — sell these pumps, which are the size
of a pager. Inside the pump is a motor. A syringe filled with short-acting
insulin is placed within the pump, with the plunger against a screw that
slowly pushes it down to push insulin out of the syringe. The end of the
syringe is attached to a short tube, which ends in a needle pushed into the
skin of the abdomen. Insulin is slowly pushed under the skin.
The rate at which insulin slowly enters the abdomen is called the basal rate.
It can be set, by way of computer chips, to vary as often as every half hour to
an hour. For example, from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., the pump may deliver 0.8 units,
while from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., the pump may deliver 1.0 units, depending upon
the needs of the patient. This amount is determined, of course, by measuring
the blood glucose with a meter (see Chapter 7).
When the patient is about to eat a meal, he or she can push a button to
deliver extra insulin, called a bolus of insulin. (The amount is determined by
carbohydrate counting, which I explain earlier in this chapter.) You can get
extra insulin if the blood glucose is too high at any time.
Pump usage has its advantages:
 It’s flexible because the bolus is taken just before meals.
 It often smoothes out the swings of glucose during the day because the
insulin is administered slowly and in small doses.
 It can be rapidly disconnected and reconnected to take a shower or
swim. (However, it can take a little getting used to when worn to bed.)
 It’s safe from overdosage because it has built-in protective devices to
prevent this occurrence.
Figure 10-4:

219
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

However, pump usage has definite disadvantages besides the high cost:
 Infections of the skin are frequent because the infusion set is left in place
for several days. These infections are usually mild, however.
 Overall diabetic control is not necessarily better with the pump than
with other ways of delivering insulin, especially with the new insulin
glargine. The latest proof of this was an article published in Diabetes
Care in September 2003.
 Because the patient receives only short-acting insulin, if insulin stops
entering, ketoacidosis may come on rapidly (see Chapter 4).
 Some patients are allergic to the tape that holds the infusion set onto
the abdomen.
 Blood glucose must be measured often to adjust the pump for optimal
control.
Pump usage is definitely not treatment to be done on your own at the begin-
ning. You need a diabetologist to help with dosages, a dietitian to help you
calculate amounts of boluses based upon carbohydrate intake, and someone
from the manufacturer to teach you how to set the pump and to be available
to fix any malfunctions.
If you use a pump and your blood glucose rises above 250 mg/dl, take the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Take a bolus of insulin with the pump to bring it down. (The amount is
determined by your sensitivity to insulin.)
2. Recheck your glucose in an hour.
3. If the glucose is still above 250 mg/dl, use a syringe to take more insulin.
4. Check your infusion set.
5. Check the ketones in your urine and report to a doctor if the amount
is moderate to large.
6. Recheck your glucose every two hours and use more insulin as needed.
Is an insulin pump for you? If you’re willing to invest the time and effort at
first, if your schedule is very uncertain particularly with respect to meals,
and if your glucose control has not been good with other means, you should
look into this option.
My patients who use the pump have generally had positive experiences. Now
that they have it, none of them are willing to give up the pump. Occasionally,
they disconnect the pump to allow their skin to heal. They have generally
shown improved glucose control and a better hemoglobin A1c.
220
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Do I recommend using an insulin pump? With the new form of insulin called
insulin glargine, you can accomplish a continuous basal control of the blood
glucose much like the pump does. The pump proponents say that you need
to be able to alter the basal dose for different conditions throughout the day
and you can’t do that with a single shot of insulin. Although this is true, I am
not sure that it makes a great difference in the course of controlling the blood
glucose.
Is one pump better than another? All seem to have excellent mechanical fea-
tures, and all provide you with the ability to adjust your insulin in several
ways. They all have alarms for any eventuality like blockage of the tube, an
electrical failure, and so forth. They try to differentiate themselves by offer-
ing different options for how the insulin is delivered, but you may find that
you need the help of a rocket scientist to figure those differences out.
One pump that does deserve special mention, because it is the wave of the
future, is the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm 512. This pump is sold with the
Paradigm Link Blood Glucose Monitor. Readings taken by the monitor are
wirelessly sent to the pump, which uses a software program to calculate the
bolus of insulin to be given, taking into account the food about to be eaten,
which must be entered into the pump. The wearer must accept the bolus
before it is delivered. This product is just short of the so-called closed loop
system, where the blood glucose determines the amount of insulin to be
given, just as the normal pancreas is constantly doing. The pump chooses
the boluses, but it does not constantly alter the basal level of insulin, because
there is no continuing information about the current blood glucose level. The
wearer must test the blood glucose with his or her meter in order for the
pump to know glucose levels.
For an extensive discussion of the various types of insulin pumps that are
available, their pros and cons and much more about using a pump to deliver
insulin, see my new book, Type 1 Diabetes For Dummies (Wiley).
Utilizing aids to insulin delivery
For those of you still using the old needle-and-syringe method, I want you to
be aware of numerous aids that can make it easier for you to take insulin:
 Spring-loaded syringe holders: You place your syringe in the holder,
hold it against the skin, and press a button. The needle enters, and
you’ve administered the insulin.
 Syringe magnifiers: These help the visually impaired person administer
insulin.
221
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

 Syringe-filling devices: You can feel and hear a click as you take up
insulin.
 Subcutaneous infusion sets: A catheter is placed under the skin, and
injections are made into the catheter instead of the skin to reduce 
punctures.
 Needle guides: You can use these guides when you can’t see the rubber
part of the insulin bottle to insert the needle to take up the insulin.
Call your local American Diabetes Association branch or look in the back of
the ADA’s Diabetes Forecast magazine to find sources for these products.
If you take a drug that makes you prone to hypoglycemia, you need to wear a
medical bracelet or necklace that identifies you as a person with diabetes
who may be hypoglycemic. Numerous companies make these products.
Using Other Medications
Most of this chapter is devoted to medications that lower the blood glucose,
but diabetes involves more than elevated blood glucose levels. People with
diabetes often have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and they suffer
more sickness when exposed to influenza or pneumonia. It is important to
consider this fact in the overall management of your disease.
If you have high blood pressure (see Chapter 7), lifestyle changes, including
weight loss and physical activity, may be all you need to control the condi-
tion. However, if lifestyle changes alone don’t work, numerous medications
are available that control blood pressure. See my book High Blood Pressure
For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) for a complete discussion of this subject.
Controlling blood pressure is as important as controlling blood glucose in
preventing diabetic complications.
Most people with diabetes also have elevated levels of LDL or “bad” choles-
terol (see Chapter 7). Excellent drugs are available to manage this problem if
lifestyle changes don’t suffice. See Controlling Cholesterol For Dummies (Wiley)
by Carol Ann Rinzler and Martin W. Graf for the answers to your questions on
this topic. Cholesterol control is another cornerstone of excellent diabetic
care. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2004
indicates that when it comes to LDL cholesterol, the lower, the better. Talk to
your doctor about this.
People with diabetes, especially those whose glucose is poorly controlled, are
prone to become sicker when they develop influenza or pneumonia. Excellent
222
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

vaccinations for these illnesses are available. Flu vaccine is given annually,
and pneumonia vaccine is given once if you are older than 65 and received a
previous vaccination more than five years ago.
Finally, aspirin has been shown to reduce sickness and death due to coronary
artery disease (which I discuss in Chapter 5). Because coronary artery dis-
ease is such a prominent feature of diabetes, many doctors recommend that
all patients with diabetes take a daily aspirin tablet. Diabetics may need more
than the usual dose of a baby aspirin to reduce their risk of heart attacks; a
full adult pill may be necessary.
Avoiding Drug Interactions
Studies have shown that some patients with diabetes are taking as many as
four to five drugs, including their diabetes medications. These drugs often
interact, and the cost of treating harmful drug interactions is more than $4
billion. Sometimes (believe it or not) even your doctor is not aware of the
interactions of common drugs. You need to know the names of all the drugs
you take and whether they affect one another.
Many common medications used for the treatment of high blood pressure
also raise the blood glucose, sometimes bringing out a diabetic tendency that
might otherwise not have been recognized:
 Thiazide diuretics often raise the glucose by causing a loss of potas-
sium. Among these drugs are Diuril, hydroDiuril, Oretic, and Zaroxolyn.
 Beta blockers reduce the release of insulin and include such drugs as
Inderal, Lopressor, and Tenormin.
 Calcium channel blockers also reduce insulin secretion and include
Adalat, Calan, Cardizem, Isoptin, Norvasc, and Procardia.
 Minoxidil can raise blood glucose.
Drugs used for other purposes can also raise blood glucose:
 Corticosteroids, even in topical use, can raise blood glucose. (See
Chapter 2 for more on corticosteroids.)
 Cyclosporine, used to prevent organ rejection, can raise the blood glu-
cose by poisoning the insulin-producing beta cell.
 Diphenylhydantoin, known as Dilantin, is a drug for seizures and blocks
insulin release.
223
Chapter 10: Medications: What You Should Know

 Oral contraceptives were previously accused of causing hyperglycemia
when the dose of estrogen was very high, but current preparations are
not a problem.
 Nicotinic acid and niacin, used to lower cholesterol, can bring out a
hyperglycemic tendency.
 Phenothiazines, such as Compazine, Serentil, Stelazine, and Thorazine,
can block insulin secretion and cause hyperglycemia.
 Thyroid hormone, in elevated levels, raises the blood glucose by reduc-
ing insulin from the pancreas.
Many common medications, either on their own or by doing something to
make the oral drugs that lower blood glucose more potent, also lower the
blood glucose. The most important of these include the following:
 Salicylates and acetaminophen, known as aspirin and Tylenol, can
lower the blood glucose, especially when given in large doses.
 Ethanol, in any form of alcohol, can lower the blood glucose, particu-
larly when taken without food.
 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, used for high blood pres-
sure, such as Accupril, Captopril, Lotensin, Monopril, Prinivil, Vasotec,
and Zestril, can lower the blood glucose, though the mechanism is
unclear.
 Alpha-blockers, another group of antihypertensives that includes
Prazosin, lower the glucose as well.
 Fibric acid derivatives like Clofibrate, used to treat disorders of fat,
cause a lowering of blood glucose.
If you start a new medication and suddenly find that your blood glucose is
significantly higher or lower than usual, ask your doctor to check for the pos-
sibility that the new medication has a definite glucose-lowering or glucose-
raising effect.
Finding Assistance Obtaining Drugs
Diabetes can be expensive, especially if you need several drugs to control
your blood glucose. The pharmaceutical companies understand, and several
offer programs to provide medication for a period of time. Table 10-1 tells you
what you need to know about these companies.

All these programs require you to get a prescription from your doctor. The

requirements and needs the drug. Not all companies give away free drugs for
life. If you cannot afford to buy a drug that you’re taking, do not hesitate to
call the company and ask whether it has a patient-assistance program.

Diabetes Is Your Show
In This Chapter
 Preparing for your role as author, producer, director, and star
 Tapping into the talents of your physicians
 Welcoming other professionals to your crew
 Inviting your family and friends — your captivated and caring audience
 Making use of the Internet
S
hakespeare said it: “All the world’s a stage.” That quote applies to dia-
betes beautifully. You have many roles in life, and one of them is the role
of a person with diabetes. As with any role, you’re not expected to play it
alone. You have a large cast and crew, all of whom are eager to help you, but
you must be willing to ask for their help and know how to use them so that
they can give you their best. Believe me, as a member of that crew, everyone
wants to give you their best.
The question is, do you want your play to be a comedy or a tragedy? Because
you hold all the major positions, the choice is entirely up to you. And remem-
ber, as with all plays, life goes on offstage. Your role as a person with diabetes
is one of many, including brother or sister, mother or father, boss or
employee, and so on. Fortunately, the life skills that you discover as someone
with diabetes are applicable to all your other roles.
One of the new kids on the block is the Internet (perhaps not so new). The
resources it offers deserve mention in this chapter on using all the tools
available to manage your diabetes.
Your Role as Author, Producer, 
Director, and Star
Being the author, the producer, the director, and the star may seem like a lot
of responsibility — and it is. Unlike many short-term illnesses where the doctor
knows what has to be done, instructs you to do it, writes a prescription, and

you’re cured, diabetes is your daily companion for life. No one, not even your
mother or spouse, can be with you all of the time. Therefore, you’re the one
who writes the script and the action. You decide whether you’ll take your
medication or exercise regularly. You determine whether you’ll follow a diet
that will control your weight and your blood glucose.
You’re the one who needs to gather the resources needed to play the role
properly. In this sense, you’re the producer. You need your props and your
theater, the equipment, the medications, and the environment in which to
manage your diabetes. Your environment may be a comfortable home where
you can eat the proper diet and a good exercise facility where you can burn
up calories while you strengthen your heart. Or it may be the sidewalk where
you can safely walk or jog.
After you have the resources, you need to direct your cast and crew to make
your play come out the way you envision it. You’re the one who sees to it that
the primary physician obtains a hemoglobin A1c (see Chapter 7) every three
or four months and that he or she sends you to the eye doctor at least once a
year. The physician is dealing with many patients each day and can easily
forget your specific needs. You must let the doctor know what your needs are
and not expect the doctor to read your mind. You may be dealing with other
doctors who treat your heart, your lungs, and other parts of you. Each doctor
needs to know all the medications you take.
Finally, you’re the star of the show. That role is both an honor and a responsi-
bility. Although you may wish that you had never been chosen for this partic-
ular role, there it is. You can make of it what you will. You can learn all your
lines (understand your disease) and speak them fluently (take your medica-
tions, follow your diet, and so on), or not. Obviously, not studying your lines
is a lot easier, but in that case, the result can be a tragedy. Take proper care
of yourself, and the smile on your face and that of all your fellow cast mem-
bers and crew will clearly indicate that you have written, produced, directed,
and starred in a comedy.
The Primary Physician — 
Your Assistant Director
Your primary physician takes on a new role in diabetes, where he or she
becomes a facilitator. In the United States, where you can find numerous spe-
cialists, only 8 percent of people with diabetes are regularly seen by a spe-
cialist. The other 92 percent are in the hands of more general doctors who
have to deal with many other illnesses besides diabetes. This is a conse-
quence of the large size of the diabetic population and the requirements of a
healthcare system with limited resources.
228
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

While using a primary physician instead of a specialist may seem not con-
ducive to the best care, I can say many good things about it. Remember,
you’re a person who has diabetes. Other things can go wrong, and the pri-
mary physician can handle them as well. Your mild heart disease may not
require a cardiologist, and your primary physician can also manage your
bronchitis very well.
You should expect your primary physician to have a decent working knowl-
edge of diabetes. Chapter 7 describes the proper way to follow a person with
diabetes. The various tests are essential to your health, and the primary
physician must know which ones to order and when to send you to a special-
ist because your needs are beyond his or her expertise.
The Diabetologist or Endocrinologist —
Your Technical Consultant
An endocrinologist should have the most in-depth knowledge of the manage-
ment of diabetes. She has had advanced training for several years (on top of
the years of training in general internal medicine) and devotes his or her
practice to taking care of people with diabetes, plus patients with problems
of the thyroid, adrenals, or other glands. A diabetologist is an endocrinologist
who takes care of only diabetic patients.
If you have type 1 diabetes, you will certainly see an endocrinologist sooner
or later. If you have type 2 diabetes and get into trouble with complications
or control, the endocrinologist will be called in for consultation. You have the
right to expect that this physician will be able to answer most questions that
arise during the care of diabetes.
This doctor will be up on the newest treatments for diabetes, so if you have
questions about the future of diabetes care, ask him. This doctor should also
have the best understanding of all the drugs currently used for diabetes, how
they interact with each other, their side effects, and other drugs that interact
with them.
If you’re not satisfied with the answers you’re getting from your primary
physician, ask for a referral to a specialist. Many health plans today try to
steer you away from the specialist because this doctor orders more expen-
sive tests and costs more to see by virtue of the extra years of specialty train-
ing. Do not take no for an answer. If your primary doctor will not refer you,
find one who will.
If your endocrinologist or diabetologist makes any changes to your treatment,
report those changes to your primary physician. One of the big problems in
229
Chapter 11: Diabetes Is Your Show

medicine is the lack of communication between medical care providers of all
types, not just doctors.
For your own sake, make sure that all your medical care providers know 
what the others are doing for you. Carry a list of your medications and show
it each time you have a doctor visit. You might even carry the actual medica-
tions so the doctor can verify that you are getting the medications in the
strengths that she thinks you are getting.
The Eye Doctor — Your 
Lighting Designer
The eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) ensures that your diabetes
does not damage your vision. This doctor has had advanced training in dis-
eases of the eye. Your primary care physician must see (no pun intended) to
it that you have an examination by this specialist at least once a year and
more often if necessary.
An ophthalmologist or optometrist must dilate the pupils of the eyes in order
to do a proper examination.
The eye doctor examines you for the conditions I outline in Chapter 5. He or
she must send a report to your primary care physician. He or she should also
take the opportunity to educate you about diabetic eye disease.
Sometimes the good deed of restoring vision leads to unexpected, negative
consequences. One ophthalmologist I talked to told me that he restored the
vision of a diabetic patient, only to have the patient buy a gun and nearly
shoot someone with whom he had a grievance.
The Foot Doctor — Your Dance Instructor
The foot doctor or podiatrist is your best source of help with the minor (and
some of the major) foot problems that all people suffer. You should go to him
with such problems as toenails that are hard to cut, corns and calluses, and
certainly any ulcer or infection of your foot. This is especially true if you have
any neuropathy (see Chapter 5). In that case, you’re better off not trying to
cut your toenails by yourself.
230
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Foot doctors I spoke with emphasized that the earlier you see a podiatrist,
the less likely that a minor problem will be converted into a major disaster.
For example, an infected toe that would respond to soaking by the person
without diabetes may need antibiotics, special shoes, and surgical removal of
dead tissue in the person with diabetes.
The doctor can tell you which preparations you should not use on your skin.
He or she can show you how important it is that you give lesions time to heal
and not to rush to put weight on your injured feet. Many podiatrists also give
you a list of dos and don’ts for the proper care of your feet, such as conduct-
ing daily inspections, avoiding extreme heat, and so on. Chapter 5 details all
the things you need to do to preserve good foot health.
The Dietitian — Your Food 
Services Provider
This person serves one of the most important roles in your care. Because
most diabetes is type 2, and type 2 is greatly worsened by obesity, a good
dietitian can really help you to control your blood glucose both by eating the
right foods and amounts and helping you to lose weight. The dietitian can
also show you which foods belong to which energy source — carbohydrate,
protein, and fat. (See Chapter 8 for more on your diet.)
The person with type 1 diabetes needs to know how food interacts with the
insulin injections that are mandatory. The dietitian can teach you to count
carbohydrates so that you know how much insulin to take for your meals.
(See Chapter 10 for more on carbohydrate counting.)
A good dietitian usually holds up a mirror to you, showing you not only what
you eat but how you eat as well. When do you consume most of your calories,
and where do they come from? All ethnic foods can be adjusted so that you
enjoy the foods you have always eaten while you stay within the bounds of a
diabetic diet. A good dietitian is the best source for this kind of information.
The dietitian can also show you what a portion of food really means. This
demonstration is an eye-opener in most cases. You usually find that you have
been eating portions much larger than necessary. Unfortunately, when it
comes to a diabetic diet, you can’t have your cake and eat it, too. But you can
see in Appendix A, which offers gourmet recipes for people with diabetes,
that every culture makes delicious food that is actually good for the person
231
Chapter 11: Diabetes Is Your Show

with diabetes. For even more information on this important topic, see my
book Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley).
One thing you want to be sure of is that the dietitian is flexible in her approach
to food. There are a few rules about where your calories should come from,
but you have plenty of room for variation within those rules. The diet you are
ultimately given should take into account your preferences as well as the fact
that the amount of carbohydrate, protein, and fat is different for different
individuals. Any dietitian who simply hands you a printed diet and says “Go
follow it” is doing you no favor.
The Diabetes Educator — 
Your Researcher
Every person in your play is actually an educator in addition to his other
role, but this person is especially trained to teach you what you need to
know about every aspect of diabetes so that you properly take care of your-
self. He should have CDE (Certified Diabetes Educator) after his name. A CDE
has taken extensive courses in diabetes and has passed an examination.
A diabetes educator teaches you how to take your insulin or pills, how to test
your blood glucose, and how to acquire any of the other skills you need. You
can find many diabetes educators in a Diabetes Education Program. Once you
have gotten over the shock of having diabetes, asking your primary physician
to refer you to such a program is a good idea. After you have gone through
the program, go back and update yourself. New drugs and new procedures
are constantly being discovered. The diabetes educator can be a wonderful
source of information about these, while making sure that you continue in
your good diabetic habits.
The Pharmacist — Your Usher
The role of the usher may not sound important, but how will you enjoy the
play if you cannot find your seat? The pharmacist is your guide to all the
medications and tools required to control your blood glucose and manage
any complications that you develop. He or she ushers you into the use of all
these strange and new products. You may see your pharmacist more often
than you see any other of your cast and crew who are actually in the medical
field.
232
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Each time you start a new medication, a good pharmacist checks to make
sure that it does not conflict with other medicines you are taking. The phar-
macist tells you about side effects and makes sure that your doctor is check-
ing you for adverse drug reactions or interactions. The pharmacist may give
you a printout that you can take home and refer to, telling you all you need to
know about your new medication.
Many pharmacists also prepare a list of medications that you take, telling you
each drug’s strengths and dosage frequency. You can carry this around in
case any doctor ever needs to know what you take.
Modern pharmacists are also doing a lot of education. Posters in the phar-
macy explain diseases and drugs. Pharmacists can tell you about helpful
over-the-counter drugs that your doctor doesn’t prescribe. They are also
often aware of new drugs and treatments before they become well known.
Some pharmacies have blood pressure devices that you can use for free, as
well as glucose meters.
The Mental Health Worker — 
Your Supporting Actor
Your mental health worker may be a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or a social
worker, or your primary physician may play this role. This person comes 
in handy whenever you have days when you feel you just can’t cope. (See
Chapter 1 for more about dealing with the emotional aspects of diabetes.)
The mental health worker is there at those times to support you and get you
going again. Diabetes certainly proves the fact that all disease is both physi-
cal and emotional.
Your Family and Friends — Your
Captivated and Caring Audience
Your audience is the people you live with, eat with, and play with. Your family
and friends can be a tremendous source of help, but you must clue them to
the fact that you have diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, you can teach
them how to recognize when your glucose is too low, in case you’re ever too
ill to take care of yourself. If you have type 2, ask them to moderate their diet
so that you can follow yours. A diabetic diet is good for anyone. Complying
233
Chapter 11: Diabetes Is Your Show

with your diet is difficult enough, and you don’t need your family exposing
you to high-calorie foods.
A family member or friend can also become your exercise partner. Sticking to
a program is a lot easier when a partner is counting on you to show up to
work out. Your family and friends can also accompany you when you visit the
doctor and remind you to ask the doctor a question or to follow the instruc-
tions you received.
Let these people know about your diabetes and buy them a copy of this book
so that they better understand what you are going through and how they can
best help you.
The Internet: Your Potential 
Partner in Lifestyle Change
Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle disease. Some harmful choices for your lifestyle
contributed to your development of type 2 diabetes and some helpful choices
will help you control it or prevent it if you don’t have it yet. Unlike the people
in your life, who can hardly be there with you 24 hours a day, the Internet is
only a mouse click away at any time. On the Internet you can find help for the
two key aspects of your lifestyle that affect diabetes, diet and exercise.
Because weight loss is the main preoccupation of millions of Americans,
there are numerous sites that promise incredible results. Probably the single
most important feature of the site that will help you to succeed is continued
feedback. If you get regular new advice (at least weekly) and peer support in
the form of bulletin boards where you can interact with others, you will lose
three times as much as with sites that provide only Internet-based diet and
exercise information.
Sites for diet and weight loss
Some of the better sites for diet and weight loss include:
 Ediets.com, which gives you a choice of many different diets and will
provide the food as well as weekly updates and suggestions. There are
more than 22 diet plans, one of which is sure to appeal to you.
 Diet.webmd.com uses a questionnaire to develop a “diet just for you”.
The diet is called a nutritional plan rather than a diet. It is personalized
234
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

and nutritionally sound. You fill out a daily nutritional journal that the
people at webmd comment upon. They analyze your progress and nutri-
tional needs each week.
 Shapeup.org is the web address of Shape Up America, a site that was
founded by C. Everett Koop, M. D. It offers lots of information about
nutrition and a place where you can tell your story or read the story of
others. If you are running into difficulty, you can e-mail the site and get
feedback from others who have been successful.
Sites for exercise programs 
Some of the better sites for these types of programs include:
 Freetrainers.com offers individualized fitness programs with individual
advice and message boards for reading the experiences of others and
offering your own.
 Workoutsforyou.com offers personalized fitness programs. You get
weekly email tips and unlimited email consultations. There are lots of
member testimonials in case you want to read the experience of others.
 Global-fitness.com is the address for Global Health and Fitness, a site
that offers a large amount of information on fitness with lots of feedback
from trainers. Judging by the successful clients they show on the site,
they get some fairly good results.
None of these sites tell you about the people who did not do so well or even
the ratio of successful to unsuccessful clients. Don’t spend a lot of money up
front until you are sure the program is what you need and what works for
you. Good luck!
Finding reputable Web sites
Not everything that you find on the Internet is true, let alone reputable. The
Health on the Net Foundation has established a set of principles that any site
on the Internet can adhere to. From its Web site at www.hon.ch, you can
search for medical sites that follow these HONcode principles:
 Principle 1: Any medical or health advice provided and hosted on this
site will be given by medically trained and qualified professionals unless
a clear statement is made that a piece of advice offered is from a non-
medically qualified individual or organization.
235
Chapter 11: Diabetes Is Your Show

 Principle 2: The information provided on this site is designed to sup-
port, not replace, the relationship that exists between a patient/site visi-
tor and his/her existing physician.
 Principle 3: Confidentiality of data relating to individual patients and
visitors to a medical/health Web site, including their identity, is respected
by this Web site. The Web site owners undertake to honor or exceed the
legal requirements of medical/health information privacy that apply in
the country and state where the Web site and mirror sites are located.
 Principle 4: Where appropriate, information contained on this site will
be supported by clear references to source data and, where possible,
have specific HTML links to that data. The date when a clinical page was
last modified will be clearly displayed (e.g. at the bottom of the page).
 Principle 5: Any claims relating to the benefits/performance of a specific
treatment, commercial product or service will be supported by appro-
priate, balance evidence in the manner outlined in Principle 4.
 Principle 6: The designers of this Web site will seek to provide informa-
tion in the clearest possible manner and provide contact addresses for
visitors that seek further information or support. The Webmaster will
display his/her e-mail address clearly throughout the Web site.
 Principle 7: Support for this Web site will be clearly identified, including
the identities of commercial and non-commercial organizations that
have contributed funding, services, or material for the site.
 Principle 8: If advertising is a source of funding, it will be clearly stated.
A brief description of the advertising policy adopted by the Web site
owners will be displayed on the site. Advertising and other promotional
material will be presented to viewers in a manner and context that facili-
tates differentiation between it and the original material created by the
institution operating the site.
If a site agrees with these principles, you can bet the information on it is very
reliable. I describe many of the HONcode sites in Appendix C.

Putting Your Knowledge 
to Work for You
In This Chapter
 Improving your frame of mind
 Optimizing your use of tests and monitoring
 Properly taking medication
 Sticking to a healthy diet
 Using exercise to your advantage
 Taking advantage of expertise and support
I
f you read every word in Part III of this book, you now know as much as
the experts. But knowing is often quite a distance from doing. If this fact
were not the case, the world would be a much better place to live in because
most people know what needs to be done. They just don’t do it.
The key thing is to get going on improving your health now. Don’t wait
another day to begin to do the things that can prolong your life and increase
its quality at the same time. You don’t want to regret your life the way poor
George Burns did. When a beautiful girl walked into his hotel room and said,
“I’m sorry, I must be in the wrong room,” he told her, “No, you’re not in the
wrong room. You are just 40 years too late.”
Delaying or Preventing Diabetes
There are a number of things you can do to delay or prevent your develop-
ment of diabetes. Among the key things are
 Lifestyle modification: Lose weight or don’t allow yourself to gain
weight. Start an exercise program and exercise for 30 to 45 minutes
every day.

 Monitoring: Make sure your doctor checks for diabetes with a blood glu-
cose test every year, especially if you have prediabetes (see Chapter 3).
 Drugs: Although there are drugs that have been shown to delay the
onset of diabetes, they are associated with side effects and are not cur-
rently recommended.
Developing Positive Thinking
Studies have shown fairly conclusively that if you start with a positive frame
of mind, your body can work with you and not against you. Even when things
go wrong, if you’re optimistic, you can pick yourself up and move forward. If
you’re pessimistic, you can become depressed and believe that nothing will
help you. That kind of attitude is not conducive to good control of your blood
glucose and avoidance of complications.
I have a patient who came to me to improve his glucose control just after
having a toe amputated. This is a patient who sees a lot of manure and knows
there is a beautiful horse in the area. He refuses to believe that a temporary
setback is a permanent defeat. I got him on a program of tight diabetic con-
trol with the newer oral medications. His eyes have gotten better and his neu-
ropathy (see Chapter 5) has improved. He believes in his ability to control his
blood glucose, and all his actions are directed toward doing just that. The
result has been an amazing turnaround in his hemoglobin A1c (see Chapter
7). With his attitude, he is willing to make the changes necessary because he
knows they will pay big dividends for his health.
Achieving a positive attitude has a lot to do with how you interpret problems.
If you see them as permanent and unchangeable because of a flaw in your own
character, you will have trouble being positive. If you see them as temporary
and the result of something you can change given enough time, you will be
much more optimistic and able to solve most problems.
Monitoring and Testing
Many of my patients ask me about a cure for diabetes. One doesn’t exist yet,
but the future looks very promising. So far, doctors don’t have a portable
machine that can measure the blood glucose and respond with the right
amount of insulin. Such a gadget would not be of much use for the people who
take pills anyway. Therefore, you have to use your brain to make the calcula-
tion that your pancreas would do automatically if it could. The calculation is,
of course, how much medicine to take for a given glucose. To make the calcu-
lation, you need to know the glucose. This is where monitoring comes in.
238
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

Without fail, you should have one of the monitors that I describe in Chapter
7. If you have type 1 diabetes, you need to monitor at least before meals and
at bedtime. If you have type 2 diabetes, you can get away with a couple of
tests daily and sometimes even less if you’re stable.
Chapter 10 is where you can find what you should do in response to your test
results. If you or your doctor is computer literate, you will do much better
with a meter that can be downloaded into a computer. What you look for are
trends, and the computer makes it simple to see trends. It can look at dozens
of tests at once on a screen, compared to turning pages of a booklet contain-
ing your blood glucose readings.
Remember, however, that blood glucose tests reflect only a moment in time.
What you need to know is whether you are in control 24 hours a day. That is
where the hemoglobin A1c comes in. Your doctor should order this test at
least every four months if you’re stable and every three months if not. If you
have close to normal results in this test, you do not have to worry about
long-term complications (see Chapter 5) and will probably not be suffering
from short-term complications (see Chapter 4) either.
Even with near-normal hemoglobin A1c results, you still want to be checked
for any sign of complications. That means regular eye examinations, regular
blood and urine tests for kidney damage, and regular tests for sensation in
your feet. Your doctor should do this on schedule, and, if not, you have to
remind the doctor.
Great treatment exists for every diabetic complication, and the earlier the
treatment is started, the less likely the complication will lead to serious
damage. Routine monitoring and testing allow you to discover the problem as
early as possible.
Using Medications
Medications can be tricky. Some of them are very potent, but none of them
work if you don’t take them. Doctors use the word “noncompliance” when
they talk about the tendency of patients not to take their medications. Some
of the things you need to know when you take your medications include
 Are you taking the right dose at the right time?
 Are you taking it with or without food depending upon the medication?
 Does it mix with your other medications?
 Are you aware of side effects, and are they being monitored?
239
Chapter 12: Putting Your Knowledge to Work for You

 Can the desired effect sometimes be too strong?
 Do you have an antidote to its effect available if necessary?
 Do you need to adjust the dose when you’re not feeling well?
Starting metformin along with lifestyle changes early in the development of
type 2 diabetes is recommended by many doctors. Discuss this with your
physician as early as you can. 
Your doctor, your pharmacist, and your diabetes educator can all help you
with your medications, but you’re on your own when it comes to taking them.
If you have trouble remembering, get yourself a plastic case containing seven
sections with a day of the week above each section and fill them with each
day’s pills. These are available in pharmacies. You can easily see whether you
took them or not.
For more on medications, see Chapter 10.
Following a Diet
If you look at Appendix A and its gourmet recipes, it should be clear to you
that you’re not sacrificing very much by following an appropriate diabetic
diet, unless you consider avoiding becoming overweight to be a sacrifice. You
can enjoy delicious food that provides plenty of energy for your needs.
In years past, people often focused on reducing fat in their diets, especially
cholesterol and saturated fat (see Chapter 8). That’s important, but the atten-
tion now being paid to carbohydrate intake is especially helpful for diabetics.
And it doesn’t hurt to know something about the quality of the carbohydrate
as well as the quantity. Try to choose low glycemic index carbohydrate, like
basmati rice instead of white rice. Any carbohydrate with lots of fiber will be
a low glycemic source. You will have a lower blood glucose as a result and
require less insulin to control it. Not only does that mean better diabetic 
control, but your fats, particularly triglyceride, are also lower, and this will
decrease the severity of the metabolic syndrome (see Chapter 5) if you have
type 2 diabetes.
Most people can make changes in their diet in the short term, but maintain-
ing these changes over the long term is difficult. The best way to accomplish
a long-term change is to have a plan and stick to it. The times when you are in
unplanned situations are probably the most damaging to your diabetic con-
trol. For example, when you enter a restaurant, you’re presented with a menu.
The job of the author of that menu is to entice you by the description of the
food to order that dish, just as the pictures on the food boxes in stores entice
you to buy that food. If you have in mind what is good for your diabetic diet,
you tend to order what helps you, not what messes up your control.
240
Part III: Managing Diabetes: The “Thriving with Diabetes” Lifestyle Plan 

One of the things I encourage restaurants to do is to devote a section of their
menus to delicious diabetic meals so that you can more easily avoid tempta-
tion. Restaurants are just starting to do this, and it will take a long time to get
a lot of them to offer it. Some restaurants probably never will (especially in
Paris). Until they do, you must go out to eat prepared to order appropriately.
The same holds true when you eat at someone else’s home. If they know you
have diabetes, hopefully they will prepare something you can eat. If they do
not, you must select with great care. Do not be afraid to say no. Your friendly
dietitian can give you a lot of help on what to select and what to reject.
One thing that helps a lot in diabetes is if you have a fair amount of order in
your life. If your life is disorganized, controlling your diabetes will be much
more difficult. You must take your medications at about the same time each
day and eat at about the same time. You must test at about the same time
and exercise at about the same time. But you don’t have to eat the same
thing all the time. An endless variety of delicious foods is available to you.
For more on your diet, see Chapter 8.
Exercising Regularly
The more you exercise regularly, the better you can control your blood glucose.
This holds true for your weight as well. If you have type 2 diabetes, exercising
regularly translates into needing less or no medication. If you have type 1 dia-
betes, you need less insulin. Your exercise choices are unlimited (see Chapter
9). Yes, even a game of golf is exercise, though most people (who are not profes-
sional golfers) do not play the sport more than once or twice a week.
If you’re having trouble exercising, follow these tips:
 Do something daily, if possible, but no less than three or four times a
week. If you can’t do it regularly on your own, get an exercise partner.
You do not need a sports club to find step aerobics. Just walk up a few
flights of stairs where you work. Go for a walk outside if the weather per-
mits for at least 20 minutes.
 Set up a program with goals so that you do not stay stuck in a low
level of exercise. If you do not know how to do this yourself, check with
an exercise physiologist or personal trainer. If you’re older than 40 and
have not exercised and are overweight, check with your doctor before
beginning a strenuous program.
 Don’t limit yourself to aerobics. A little weight lifting a few days a week
can make an amazing difference in your strength, your stamina, and your
physique. If your sport is tennis, you may find that you can play that
third set with much greater ease once you start on a weight program. All
other sports benefit from weight lifting in a similar fashion.
241
Chapter 12: Putting Your Knowledge to Work for You

Exercise is definitely a way to get high without drugs. It is good for depres-
sion or any unhappy state of mind. Don’t take my word for it. Get out and find
out for yourself. See Chapter 9 for more on exercise.
Using Expertise Available to You
People are usually eager to help you with your diabetic condition. (See
Chapter 11 to find out more about your supporting cast.) So much knowledge
is out there, just waiting to be tapped. Insurance companies recognize the
value of these resources, such as dietitians and diabetes educators, and are
usually willing to pay for them.
Diabetes self-management education is another program that you should
attend early in your diagnosis and at regular intervals of every three to five
years thereafter. Who knows what great advances may have taken place since
your last educational program? Sometimes even your doctor is unaware of
them.
You can get lots of free information from your friendly pharmacist, the
Internet, and other people with diabetes. You may want to be careful of these
last two groups, however. A lot of misinformation is shared on the Internet
and among diabetic patients. Before you make a major alteration in your
treatment on the basis of uncertain information, check with your physician.
(You can find out about some of the most common bits of misinformation in
Chapters 17 and 19.)
Every time you have a question about your diabetes, write it down and save
it for your next office visit with your doctor, unless it is urgent. If you don’t
know whether something is urgent, call your doctor and let the doctor deter-
mine the urgency of your problem.
Don’t neglect your family and friends as a helpful source. These are the
people who love you and know that you would help them if the tables were
turned. The problem is that they cannot help you if they do not know what
you’re dealing with. Tell them that you have diabetes and the risks, such as
hypoglycemia, that you face. Tell them how to help you if the need arises.
You will find that the result will be a much closer relationship.

Part IV
Special 
Considerations for
Living with Diabetes

In this part . . .
T
wo groups of people, children and the elderly, have
special needs that the average adult does not have to
deal with. Children are growing and developing sexually,
while the elderly are often coping with other illnesses as
well. Both groups have emotional problems that are
unique. The child is learning to fit in with peers while sep-
arating from parents. The elderly are losing friends and
relatives at the same time that their mental processes are
declining. This part explains their special problems and
how to tackle them.
The middle-aged adult has specific problems to cope with
as well, relating to insurance (both life and health) and
employment. Fortunately, the barriers for adults with dia-
betes are rapidly coming down, but you still need to know
about possible pitfalls. Discrimination cannot be toler-
ated, and you can find out what to do about it here.
Finally, I tell you about the huge number of new develop-
ments in diabetes, putting them into perspective as to
usefulness and appropriateness. I also expose false
promises. So many things have been proposed for dia-
betes care without benefit of careful evaluation. The scien-
tific evidence for and against each is presented so that
you can make up your own mind.

Chapter 13
Your Child Has Diabetes
In This Chapter
 Managing diabetes from infancy through young adulthood
 Dealing with obesity and type 2 diabetes in children
 Finding sick day solutions
 Appreciating the extra value of team care
W
hen I wrote the first edition of this book in 1998, almost all diabetes in
children was type 1 diabetes. Today there has been a vast change in
this situation. The incidence of type 2 diabetes is rapidly approaching the
incidence of type 1 diabetes in children. The culprits to blame for this huge
increase in the population of children with type 2 diabetes are obesity and
lack of exercise. I will have a lot more to say about this in the section on type
2 diabetes in children later in this chapter.
There are still plenty of new cases of type 1 diabetes in children. This chapter
contains basic information about their care but for a full discussion of type 1
diabetes see my book Type 1 Diabetes For Dummies (Wiley).
Children with diabetes present special problems that adults with diabetes do
not have. Not only are they growing and developing from babies to adults,
but they have problems of psychological and social adjustment. Diabetes can
add complications to a period of time that is not exactly smooth, even with-
out it.
Many doctors believe that if a child has diabetes, the whole family really has
the disease because everyone must adjust to it. Because diabetes is the
second most common chronic disease in children after asthma, it is no small
problem.
In this chapter, you find out how to manage diabetes in your child at each
stage of growth and development. You need to remember that your child is
first a child and then a child with diabetes. And you also need to remember
that you are not to blame for your child’s diabetes. Diabetes is not a form of
retribution for your sins. It’s also important to remember that your child is
not to blame either.

Your Baby or Preschooler Has Diabetes
If your infant or preschooler is diagnosed with diabetes, you may feel over-
whelmed. The information in this section can help you understand that this
diagnosis isn’t the end of the world — it’s the beginning of many years of spe-
cial care for your child.
Nurturing a diabetic infant
Although type 1 diabetes does not usually show up in babies, it can, and you
should know what to expect when it does. Obviously, your baby is not verbal
and cannot tell you what is bothering him or her. For this reason, you may
miss the fact that the baby is urinating excessively in his or her diaper. The
baby will lose weight and have vomiting and diarrhea, but this may be
ascribed to a stomach disorder rather than diabetes. When the diagnosis is
finally made, the baby may be very sick and require a stay in a pediatric
intensive care unit. Do not blame yourself for not realizing that your baby
was sick with diabetes.
After the diagnosis is made, the hard work begins. You must learn to give
insulin injections and to test the blood glucose in a child who will be reluc-
tant to have either one done. You have to learn when and what to feed the
baby, both to encourage growth and development and to prevent low blood
glucose.
At this stage, you don’t need to be as worried about tight glucose control as
you will be later on. There are several reasons for this. First, the baby’s neu-
rological system is still developing. Frequent, severe low blood glucose dam-
ages this development, so the glucose is permitted to be higher now than
later on. Second, studies show that changes associated with high blood glu-
cose leading to diabetic complications do not begin to add up until the pre-
pubertal years, so you have a grace period during which you can allow less
tight control.
On the other hand, a small baby is very fragile. He or she has less of every-
thing, so small losses of water, sodium, potassium, and other substances lead
more rapidly to a very sick baby. If you keep the baby’s blood glucose around
150 to 200 mg/dl (8.3 to 11.1 mmol/L), you are doing very well.
Taking care of a toddler with diabetes
Diagnosing diabetes in your preschooler may be just as difficult as it is in the
baby. The child may still be preverbal and running around in diapers.
246
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

A preschooler is beginning the process of separating from his parents and
starting to learn to control the environment (by becoming toilet-trained, for
example). This separation process makes it more difficult for you, the parent,
to give insulin injections and test the glucose. You must be firm in insisting
that these things be done. You’ll need to do them yourself because a small
child neither knows how to do them nor understands what to do with the
information generated by the glucose meter.
Because a toddler’s eating habits may not be very regular, the use of very
short-acting insulin like lispro is especially helpful (see Chapter 10). Very
soon, people with diabetes should have a way of measuring the blood glu-
cose in a painless fashion, which will be of great assistance in monitoring
these children.
Becoming an educated caregiver
For a time of variable duration — a so-called “honeymoon period” — your
child will have seemingly regained the ability to control his or her blood glu-
cose with little or no insulin. (See the nearby sidebar “The honeymoon
period.”) This period always ends, and it isn’t your fault that it does. When it
ends, you have to work with your child’s doctor, dietitian, and diabetes edu-
cator to find out how to control diabetes with insulin.
To give your child appropriate care, you need to know how to do the follow-
ing things:
 Identify the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and
diabetic ketoacidosis (see Chapters 4 and 5). Each child has a particu-
lar way of expressing low or high blood glucose, for example, by becom-
ing quiet or loud. Learn the signs for your child, and let anyone else who
cares for the child know them.
 Administer insulin (see Chapter 10). Thanks to rapid-acting insulin, you
can wait to see how much the baby is eating before you decide on the
amount of insulin.
 Measure the blood glucose and urine ketones (see Chapter 7). Very fre-
quent blood glucose measurements are essential. The more information
you have, the better the control and the less frequent the hypoglycemia.
Most children need between four and seven blood glucose measure-
ments a day to achieve excellent control.
Toddlers who are toilet-trained may have accidents when their glucose
is high, because high glucose causes a large quantity of urine.
 Treat hypoglycemia with food or glucagon (see Chapter 4). Children
this young require half the adult dose of glucagon. Glucagon may cause
a toddler to vomit, but it still raises the blood glucose.
247
Chapter 13: Your Child Has Diabetes

 Feed your diabetic child (see Chapter 8).
 Set an example for lifelong exercise for your child by exercising 
with her.
 Know what to do when your child is sick with another childhood ill-
ness. If your child must go to the hospital, approach this as a positive
experience — a chance to get a tune-up.
Your responsibilities as the parent of a diabetic baby or preschooler are
extensive and time-consuming. Training your usual helpers to take over, even
for a short time, is especially difficult. Unless you hire a professional to take
over for a while, you may not get very much time away from your diabetic
infant.
Placing your child in preschool is a difficult decision. You can do so only if
you are sure that the adult supervisors are fully aware of your child’s needs
and willing to provide them.
Your other children may resent the attention that you pay to this one child. If
your other children start to misbehave, this may be the reason.
Your Primary School Child Has Diabetes
The division of children into type 1 and type 2 diabetes begins around age 10.
Important differences exist in the way type 1 and type 2 are recognized and
treated. Therefore, I discuss each separately in this section. In 1990, less than
4 percent of children diagnosed with diabetes had type 2. In 2003, the figure
had risen to more than 30 percent. In 2007 almost one of every two children
with diabetes had type 2 diabetes. For a discussion of why that number has
grown so rapidly, see the section “Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in Children,”
later in this chapter.
Coping with type 1 diabetes
In some ways, type 1 diabetes care gets a little easier with a primary school
child, but in other ways, it gets more difficult. Your child can finally tell you
when he or she has symptoms of hypoglycemia, so this is easier to recognize
and treat. But you must begin to control the blood glucose more carefully
because your child is reaching the stage where control really counts.
248
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

You still have a child who is growing and developing, so nutrition remains
critical. You must provide enough of the right kinds of calories to fuel the
growth process. A snack such as four ounces of apple juice and a graham
cracker between breakfast and lunch, between lunch and supper, and at bed-
time can help smooth out glucose control and avoid hypoglycemia.
Your child is going to do more to separate from you. He or she may insist on
giving insulin shots and doing blood tests. Studies again indicate that this is
not a good time for you to give up these tasks, certainly not completely. Your
child may not be physically capable of performing them and, in an attempt to
hide the disease from peers, may not perform them at all during school. Diet
may also suffer at school as the child tries to fit in and not stand out by
eating the things that diabetes requires.
Managing hypoglycemia
Because you are beginning to tighten the level of glucose control, hypo-
glycemia is more of a risk, especially at night. At this stage (and from now
on), you can avoid hypoglycemia by taking any or all of the following steps:
 Give a bedtime snack regularly.
 Give cornstarch at bedtime. Cornstarch is slowly broken down so that it
provides glucose over a longer period of time. There is even a commer-
cial product, called NightBite, that contains cornstarch and can be given
before bedtime.
249
Chapter 13: Your Child Has Diabetes
The honeymoon period
Given its name because it represents a period
of improvement in type 1 diabetes that does not
last, the honeymoon period occurs in most
patients. After the disease has been diagnosed
and treated so that the blood glucose levels are
close to normal, the child may require little or no
insulin for a time. This is a period of remission in
the disease and means there is still some func-
tion in the beta cell of the pancreas (see
Chapter 2). Longer remissions are seen when:
 The age at onset of diabetes is older.
 The initial presentation of the disease is
milder.
 The amount of islet cell antibody (see
Chapter 2) is lower.
This is a temporary remission and ends with a
sudden or slowly increasing requirement for
insulin. Within three years after the diagnosis,
young children experience a complete loss of
insulin production. Older children may have
some preservation of function.

 Measure and treat a low blood glucose before bedtime.
 Occasionally check the blood glucose at 3 a.m.
 Ask about symptoms of nighttime low blood glucose, such as night-
mares and headaches.
 Be sure your child does not skip meals.
 Have your child eat carbohydrates before exercising.
At least one member of your family must be able to administer glucagon by
injection to treat hypoglycemia should you be unable to get your child to eat
or drink.
Handling school issues
When your child goes to school or a daycare setting, you need to address
new problems. One issue is that he interacts with other children, wants their
approval, and wants to fit in. Your child may consider diabetes a stigma and
be very reluctant to share it with other children. A plan of treatment that
interferes with school and friendships may be very unwelcome.
Other issues may arise regarding the school’s willingness to participate in your
child’s care. To best handle these issues, you must be aware of your rights.
Federal laws, especially the Diabetes Education Act of 1991, specify that dia-
betes is a disability and that it’s unlawful to discriminate against children
with diabetes. If a school receives federal funding or is open to the public, it
has to reasonably accommodate the special needs of the diabetic child.
Any school receiving federal funds must develop a Section 504 plan to meet
the needs of the disabled child. This refers to Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The plan takes every need of the child into
account from the moment she is picked up in the morning by a bus driver
(who must know how to help the child with a diabetic problem) until she
arrives back home at the end of the day. The plan includes the child’s self-
care abilities, and it lists trained personnel by name and responsibility.
If you plan to send your child to a private school that receives no federal
funds, before enrolling, insist on a plan of care for your child identical to a
504 plan.
The law requires that a diabetic child participate fully in all school and after-
school activities. This means provisions must be made for blood glucose test-
ing, for treatment with insulin, and for taking snacks or going to the
bathroom as needed.
250
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

To accomplish this, the written Section 504 treatment plan is developed by
your doctor, you, and the school nurse, and relevant people in the school
have assigned roles. The plan must include
 Blood glucose monitoring
 Insulin administration
 Meals and snacks
 Recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia
 Recognition and treatment of hyperglycemia
 Testing of urine ketones as indicated
As the parent, you are responsible for providing all supplies for testing and
treatment. The school provider has a responsibility to understand and treat
hypoglycemia, to test the blood glucose and treat when the level is outside
certain parameters, to coordinate meals and snacks, and to permit excused
appointments to the doctor as well as restroom use. There is no reason that
your child should not participate fully in school.
You have to provide a kit every day for school that contains everything the
child needs to test the blood glucose and, if necessary, the urine for ketones.
The kit must also include any necessary insulin and syringes. A list of signs
and symptoms of high and low blood glucose is another useful addition to
this kit. A source of food must be available to the child throughout the school
day, both for snacks and prevention of hypoglycemia during exercise. The
teachers need to know to remind the child to eat. The child must be free to
eat when necessary and not have to request food from the teacher.
These kits and food sources also have to go with the child whenever the
child leaves school — for example, for a fire drill or a field trip.
Recognizing and treating type 2 diabetes
A number of clues point to a child having type 2 diabetes rather than type 1:
 The child is overweight rather than underweight at diagnosis.
 Symptoms, such as thirst and increased urination, are mild or not pre-
sent at all; if they are present, they have been going on a long time (often
months).
 The child has a strong family history for diabetes.
251
Chapter 13: Your Child Has Diabetes

 The child’s glucose level at diagnosis is usually lower than the glucose of
a patient with type 1.
 The child belongs to an ethnic group at increased risk for type 2, such as
African American, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American.
 The child has acanathosis nigricans, dark patches on the skin between
the fingers and toes, on the back of the neck, and on the underarms.
These patches are present in 90 percent of type 2 patients.
 Girls may have irregular menses caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome
(see Chapter 6).
Despite these clues pointing to type 2, the two types of diabetes can be con-
fused for several reasons. Type 1 diabetic children may be overweight. Type
2 children may have ketones in their urine, just as type 1 patients do. The glu-
cose level at diagnosis in some type 1 children is not very elevated. And the
overall occurrence of type 2 is still low enough that the doctor may not think
of the possibility.
An important thing to remember is that type 2 diabetes responds to treat-
ment with insulin much more rapidly than type 1, and the child may not need
insulin at all after a proper diet and exercise are established. No child with
type 1 diabetes can live without insulin except possibly during the brief 
honeymoon period described above.
If you have an overweight child — one who is more than 120 percent of his or
her ideal weight for height — you should request that your doctor screen
him or her for diabetes every two years by using a fasting blood glucose test.
The treatment of type 2 diabetes, both in children and adults, starts with
lifestyle change. You, the parent, must make the commitment to exercise with
your child every day. You should meet with a dietitian and discuss a diet for
the whole family that provides sufficient nutrition for the growing child while
allowing for weight loss. If these two things are accomplished, no more will
be necessary. That means limiting TV and computer time so the child is
active rather than passive. You might consider getting a pedometer for your
child and encouraging him or her to build up the number of steps taken each
day, with prizes for reaching goals.
Fad diets are not recommended for children with type 2 diabetes. Treatment
requires adopting a lifelong program of healthy eating and exercise. A diet
that emphasizes reduction in calories, especially fats, is far more likely to be
followed over the years than one that drastically changes what the child is
used to eating. Good nutrition can even be found in fast food restaurants (see
my book Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies, 2nd Edition published by Wiley).
252
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

When diet and exercise do not return the blood glucose to normal, oral hypo-
glycemic agents (see Chapter 10) are used. Although these medications are
not approved by the FDA for children, most experts agree that they are
acceptable, with metformin being the first drug used and the sulfonylureas
added as needed. If oral agents fail, insulin is given.
Your Adolescent Has Diabetes
If an adolescent or young adult has type 2 diabetes, the information in the
previous section applies, because the goal remains the same no matter what
the age: normalize the child’s weight and increase exercise in order to
achieve normal blood glucose levels. Therefore, I focus my attention in this
and the next section on type 1 diabetes.
Your adolescent or teenager with type 1 diabetes will provide some of your
biggest challenges. This is the time period when most childhood diabetes
begins. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (see Chapter 3)
showed that tight glucose control can be accomplished beginning at age 13,
and that this control can prevent complications. The higher frequency of
severe hypoglycemia that accompanies tighter control was not found to be
damaging to the brain of a child at this age. However, children at this age do
not think in terms of long-term blood glucose control and prevention of com-
plications. So they’re not willing to do many of the tasks required to control
their diabetes on a regular basis.
The goal of treatment at this stage is a hemoglobin A1c between 7 and 9 percent
(see Chapter 7). A value above 11 percent indicates poor control. This is not
true for smaller children, who are allowed to have a higher hemoglobin A1c.
This stage is when your child is most eager to become independent. You
don’t want to give up all control at this time for several reasons:
 Your child actually does better if he or she has limits that are clearly
stated and enforced.
 The “shame” of diabetes may cause the child to skip shots and food,
especially around friends.
 The problem of eating disorders (see Chapter 8) may pop up at this
time, especially among girls trying to maintain a slim body image. Girls
with diabetes know that if they skip their injections, they lose weight.
They may ignore the high blood glucose that results.
 Teenagers with diabetes may still be unable to translate levels of blood
glucose into appropriate action.
253
Chapter 13: Your Child Has Diabetes

The hormonal changes that occur in puberty are often associated with
insulin resistance. This may be a source of loss of control rather than any fail-
ure of your child to follow the diabetic treatment plan. Upward adjustment of
the insulin may overcome this problem.
Strenuous exercise may play an even greater role in the life of your child at
this age. The result will be a significant reduction in the amount of insulin
required after exercise. Your blood glucose measurements will help you to
define your child’s need for insulin. If your child plays a team sport, the
coach and teammates must be aware of the diabetes and permit your child to
eat, go to the bathroom, and take insulin as required. Type 1 diabetes is no
reason to prohibit strenuous exercise.
Make sure that your child snacks regularly; keep snacks readily available no
matter where your child may be.
Your Young Adult Child Has Diabetes
When your child becomes a young adult, you definitely want to give up the
control that has helped your child to thrive up to this point. Your child
should be doing his or her own testing. He or she is ready to leave the pedi-
atric level and begin to work with doctors who care for adults. This means
that you are probably out of the loop. Your child should now have the skill to
choose appropriate insulin treatment based upon blood glucose levels and
calories of carbohydrate consumed (see Chapter 10).
Your child now has new challenges, including finding work, going to college,
finding a future mate, and finding a place to live independently. At the same
time, the reluctance to admit to diabetes and the desire for a thin body con-
tinue to complicate care.
Diabetes care must be intensive at this point (see Chapter 10). Multiple shots
of intermediate and short-acting insulin are taken. Your child must follow a
diabetic diet (see Chapter 8), and an exercise program is essential (see
Chapter 9). The rest of this book really has to do with the tasks that your
young adult child with diabetes faces.
Off to College
When your child leaves for college, he or she has all the responsibility for the
diabetes. Your job is simply to make sure that all the equipment for testing the
blood glucose and administering insulin is available to your child. You should
also make the college aware of your child’s medical condition. Encourage your
child to find one or more people at the college, such as a roommate or sports
teammate, who are prepared to help your child when necessary.
254
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

Two issues are particularly important to discuss before the student leaves for
school: alcohol use and sexual activity. Alcohol use may significantly increase
in college, which means that your child may consume many empty calories
and run the risk of severe hypoglycemia if he or she fails to eat properly.
Discuss concerns about making a girl pregnant with your son, and discuss
the risk of pregnancy when diabetes is not in control with your daughter. (See
Chapter 6 for information that can fuel both discussions.) Young adults of
both sexes should know how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.
College, like the rest of your child’s life, can be experienced just as it would
be if diabetes were not present. The key is planning.
Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in Children
The epidemic of obesity, which has spread to children in the United States in
the past few decades, has led to a much higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes
in children than was ever seen before. Overweight or obesity is present in as
many as 25 percent of all children. Only a fraction of these children go on to
develop diabetes.
There are a number of conditions that can cause obesity in children but they
represent probably 1 percent of the causes. Most of them can be diagnosed
during the course of a good physical examination by your child’s pediatri-
cian. By far the major reason for obesity in children is too many calories in
and too few burned up by exercise.
Even without diabetes, obesity is a burden for children. The obese child faces
severe psychological and social consequences:
 Lower respect from peers than other disabled children get
 Less comfortable family interactions
 Poor body image 
 Low self-esteem
Defining obesity in children
The definition of obesity in children age 2 to 19 is based on the body mass
index, BMI (see Chapter 7). A child is obese or overweight if his BMI is at the
95th percentile or greater for his age and sex. He is at risk for overweight if
the BMI is between the 85th and 95th percentile. The growth charts that indi-
cate the percentiles for BMI can be found at: www.brightfutures.org/
bf2/pdf/pdf/GrowthCharts.pdf.
255
Chapter 13: Your Child Has Diabetes

Obesity is not just responsible for type 2 diabetes. It can also provoke a
number of other dangerous medical conditions in children. These include:
 Metabolic syndrome, discussed in Chapter 5, leading to an increased
tendency for heart attacks and strokes
 Polycystic ovarian syndrome, also discussed in Chapter 5, leading to
infertility, abnormal menstrual periods and hairiness in girls
 Heart disease due to the increased work of the heart
 High blood pressure, which can damage the heart and the kidneys
 Sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea with snoring and increased
blood pressure
 Fatty liver with abnormal liver enzymes in the blood
 Gallbladder disease
 Bone and joint diseases due to the weight on the bones
 Skin abnormalities like acanthosis nigricans, black velvety patches on
the joints and under the arms
 Nervous system diseases such as increased pressure in the brain with
headache and visual disturbances
Preventing obesity in children
Prevention of obesity is much preferred over treating the damage that it does.
There are a number of things that you can do to prevent obesity in your child:
 Try to have a normal weight before you become pregnant.
 Exercise throughout your pregnancy.
 Breast feed for at least three months.
 Eat meals together as a family.
 Avoid sugary drinks and fatty foods.
 Restrict time for sedentary activities like TV or computers.
 Eliminate fundraisers that sell candy and cookies.
 Insist on exercise daily and do it with your child.
Dealing with type 2 diabetes
Adding type 2 diabetes into this mix can be devastating. The consequences of
the preceding problems may lead to failure to manage the diabetes because
256
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

the child wants to avoid any activity that makes him or her even more differ-
ent from his or her peers.
It is important to separate type 1 diabetes from type 2 because the child with
type 2 diabetes has a milder condition and can be treated with pills or diet
and exercise alone. However, because children do not appreciate long-term
consequences of their actions, you often have the problem of compliance.
You must help your obese child to lose weight because most obese children
become obese adults. With the assistance of a dietitian, you can figure out
the food that your child can eat to maintain growth and development without
gaining more weight. One of the most helpful techniques is to take the child
into the supermarket and point out the difference between empty calories
and nourishing calories. Another is never to make high-calorie food, such as
cake and candy, a reward. Finally, if you keep problem foods out of the house,
there is much less likelihood that your child will eat them.
Once type 2 diabetes develops, treatment should begin as early as possible to
minimize the development of complications. Depending upon the severity of
the diabetes, the treatment can utilize any or all of the following approaches:
 Lifestyle changes: Parents must set an example of good dietary and
exercise habits. Some studies suggest that if parents go first, children
will follow. The best diet is one that emphasizes a variety of vegetables,
some fruits and small amounts of protein with minimal processed carbo-
hydrates like candy and pastries. The best exercise is what you will con-
tinue to do regularly.
 Drugs: The currently available drugs are either not recommended for
children under 16 years of age or not useful for long-term treatment.
 Surgery: Children with extreme obesity with BMIs of 35 and greater may
require bypass surgery or gastric banding. This has been successful but
has complications like infection, deficiency of certain nutrients like vita-
mins and calcium, pneumonia and hernia. It should be used especially in
children with other risk factors like a strong family history of heart dis-
ease, sleep apnea or high blood pressure. This surgery should only be
performed in medical centers with large experience in children.
Sick Day Solutions
The comments in this section apply primarily to a child with type 1 diabetes,
because children with type 2 diabetes do not lose diabetic control to nearly
the same extent.
Any child is susceptible to all the usual childhood illnesses, but diabetes
complicates your child’s care. An illness can affect diabetes in opposite ways.
257
Chapter 13: Your Child Has Diabetes

An infection may increase the level of insulin resistance so that the usual
dose of insulin is not adequate. Or it may cause nausea and vomiting so that
no food or drink can stay down, and the insulin may cause hypoglycemia. For
this reason, you need to measure the blood glucose in your sick child every
two to four hours. If the glucose is over 250 mg/dl (13.9 mmol/l), you need to
give extra short-acting insulin (see Chapter 10). If it’s under 250, you give
more carbohydrate-containing nutrients.
You also need to test ketones in your child’s urine or blood once or twice a
day (see Chapter 7), especially if the glucose is over 300 mg/dl. If the ketones
become elevated, you need to discuss the situation with your doctor.
You should probably feed your child with clear liquids like tea and soda
during the sick days. Don’t offer your child milk, because it upsets the stom-
ach. As long as your child can hold down clear liquids, you can continue to
take care of him or her. If clear liquids cannot be held down, you must con-
tact your doctor and bring your child to the hospital.
While the blood glucose remains over 250 mg/dl, use tea, water, and diet soda
so as not to add calories of carbohydrate. When the blood glucose is less
than 250 mg/dl, you can use regular soda or glucose drinks.
Thyroid Disease in Type 1 Children
Because type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease (see Chapter 2), it is not
surprising that children with type 1 have other autoimmune diseases more
commonly than unaffected children. The disease that is found most com-
monly in association with type 1 diabetes is autoimmune thyroiditis. This 
condition is discovered by obtaining a blood test that shows an abnormal
increase in proteins in the blood called thyroid autoantibodies. In a study of 
58 patients with type 1 diabetes (Diabetes Care, April 2003), 19 were found to
have autoimmune thyroiditis.
Autoimmune thyroiditis usually results in no symptoms, but occasionally it
causes low thyroid function (hypothyroidism), and even more rarely it causes
high thyroid function (hyperthyroidism). Autoimmune thyroiditis is found
mostly in girls between 10 and 20 years of age. This condition is easily
treated, as I explain in my book Thyroid For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley). 
Autoimmune thyroiditis is so common in type 1 diabetes that type 1 patients
are recommended to be screened yearly for thyroid disease with a simple
blood test that checks the level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).
258
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

The Extra Value of Team Care
When your child is first diagnosed with diabetes, the stress can be overwhelm-
ing. The guilt that comes with this diagnosis may leave you unable to help
your child much at first and certainly unable to learn all that you need to know
to master the areas of importance to the health of your child. That is why you
must depend upon the help of a diabetes care team throughout the duration of
his or her childhood, and especially when the diagnosis is first made.
Who are your teammates, and what can they do for you?
 The pediatrician can show you how to administer insulin and test the
blood glucose. This doctor can also explain how to use the information
to determine an insulin dose.
 The dietitian can show you how many calories of which foods are
needed for growth and development.
 The diabetes educator can explain the short- and long-term complica-
tions of diabetes and how your child can avoid them.
 The mental health worker can help you deal with the psychological
issues at each stage of your child’s development.
 One of these professionals can also help you with an exercise program
for your child.
Another resource that can be tremendously valuable for you and your child
is a diabetes summer camp. These camps are located all over the country
and provide a safe, well-managed place where your child can go and be in the
majority. He or she can learn a great deal about diabetes while enjoying all
the pleasures of a summer camp environment. (Certainly not a minor benefit
is the opportunity for you to have time off for perhaps the first time in years.)
You can find an extensive list of camps for diabetic children throughout 
the United States by going to the Web site www.childrenwithdiabetes.
com/camps/index.htm. This is one of the many services of the Web site
“Children with Diabetes.”
In Chapter 11, I compare diabetes to a stage play. There, the person with 
diabetes was the author, the producer, the director, and the star. When you
have a child with diabetes, he or she is the star, but you take on the roles of
author, producer, and director. You obviously have a great responsibility but
one that I feel certain you can handle. Just don’t try to do it alone. Use your
medical experts as well as your family and friends to make it manageable.

veryone wants to live a long time, but no one wants to get old. Neverthe-
less, getting old is better than the alternative. Woody Allen says the one
advantage of dying is that you don’t have to do jury duty. I think I would
rather do jury duty.
The first issue I have to tackle in this chapter is defining elderly. Every year
my definition seems to change, but I think it’s fair to talk about the age of 70
as the beginning of being elderly. Using that definition, by the year 2020, more
than 20 percent of the U.S. population will be elderly. As much as one-fifth of
that elderly population will have diabetes.
Elderly people with diabetes have special problems. Because of those special
problems, they’re hospitalized at a rate that is 70 percent higher than the
general elderly population. In this chapter, you find out about those problems
and the way to handle them.
Diagnosing Diabetes in the Elderly
The incidence of diabetes in the elderly (which is almost always type 2 dia-
betes) is higher for many reasons, but the main culprit seems to be increas-
ing insulin resistance with aging, even if the elderly person with diabetes is

not particularly obese or sedentary. Doctors do not yet understand why
insulin resistance increases. When they look at the pancreas, it seems to be
able to make insulin at the usual rate. The fasting blood glucose actually rises
very slowly as you get older. The glucose after meals, however, rises much
quicker and leads to the diagnosis.
Because the fasting blood glucose is usually normal, some doctors recom-
mend using the hemoglobin A1c (see Chapter 7) to help to make the diagno-
sis in the elderly population. A hemoglobin A1c that is 11⁄2 percent higher than
the upper limit of normal for that lab is considered diagnostic of diabetes.
Because most labs have a normal of up to 5.4 percent, a value of 7 percent or
greater is probably diabetes. Results that fall between normal and that value
are in a gray zone that probably indicates impaired glucose tolerance (see
Chapter 2).
Elderly people with diabetes often do not complain of any symptoms. When
they do, the symptoms may not be the ones usually associated with type 
2 diabetes, or they may be confusing. Elderly people with diabetes may com-
plain of loss of appetite or weakness, and they may lose weight rather than
becoming obese. They may have incontinence of urine, which is usually
thought of as a prostate problem in elderly men or a urinary tract infection in
older women. Elderly people with diabetes may not complain of thirst
because their ability to feel thirst is altered.
Evaluating Intellectual Functioning
You need to evaluate the intellectual function of an elderly person with dia-
betes because managing the disease requires a fairly high level of mental
functioning. The patient has to follow a diabetic diet, administer medications
properly, and test the blood glucose. Studies have shown that elderly people
with diabetes have a higher incidence of dementia (loss of mental function-
ing) and Alzheimer’s disease than nondiabetics, making it much harder for
them to perform these tasks.
The patient can take cognitive screening tests to determine his or her level of
function. Testing makes it easier to tell whether the patient can be self-suffi-
cient or will need help. Many older people who are living alone with no assis-
tance really require an assisted-living situation or even a nursing home.
Considering Heart Disease
The major cause of death in the elderly person with diabetes is a heart
attack. Strokes and loss of blood flow in the feet are also much more common
262
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

in diabetics than nondiabetics. Usually, elderly diabetics suffer not only from
diabetes but also have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, are over-
weight or obese, and do little exercise.
Although many of these patients have had a diagnosis of diabetes for a rela-
tively short time, they have actually suffered from the metabolic syndrome
for many years. This is the reason for their high frequency of vascular dis-
eases in the heart, brain, and legs. I discuss both the metabolic syndrome
and vascular diseases in Chapter 5.
After the diagnosis is made, it is too late for diabetes prevention, but a major
effort should be made to control the glucose, the blood pressure, and the
cholesterol in order to postpone the onset of vascular disease.
Aspirin has been shown to protect against blood clots in the heart and in the
vessels that provide blood to the legs and brain. If there is no other drug
being used that prevents clotting like Plavix or heparin, aspirin should be
used in all elderly people with diabetes. Low dose aspirin, 75 to 162 mg/day is
as effective as higher doses. Check with your doctor before you start it!
If you have been smoking for decades, although you can’t do much about
cancer or emphysema, you can prevent the sudden death associated with
cigarette smoking. That complication of smoking disappears in a few days of
no cigarettes.
Diabetics are at the same high risk of having a first heart attack as nondiabet-
ics are of having a second heart attack. Blood pressure drugs called beta
blockers have been shown to reduce second heart attacks in nondiabetics.
Along with aspirin, beta blockers should be considered as standard treat-
ment for diabetics before a heart attack ever occurs. Talk to your doctor
about getting on these drugs.
Preparing a Proper Diet
Diet and exercise are the foundations of good diabetic care for the elderly
just as they are in the younger population.
In addition to sometimes lacking the intellectual function required to under-
stand and prepare a proper diabetic diet, the elderly have other problems
when it comes to proper nutrition:
 They may have poor vision and be unable to see to read or cook.
 They may have low income and be unable to purchase the foods that
they require.
263
Chapter 14: Diabetes and the Elderly

 Their taste and smell may be decreased, so they lose interest in food.
 They often have a loss of appetite.
 They may have arthritis or a tremor that prevents cooking.
 They may have poor teeth or a dry mouth.
Any one of these problems may be enough to prevent proper eating by the
elderly person, with the result that the diabetes is poorly controlled.
Anyone over the age of 65 who has Medicare part B insurance coverage is
covered for the services of a dietitian for medical nutrition therapy. Be sure to
take advantage of this benefit. The dietitian can analyze the elderly person’s
current intake and make recommendations to insure a balanced diet that will
help with control of the blood glucose.
Avoiding Hypoglycemia
The elderly, who are already somewhat frail, are especially hard-hit by the
consequences of hypoglycemia and are especially prone to it because of sev-
eral factors:
 Their food intake may be uncertain.
 They may be taking multiple medications.
 They may sometimes skip medications.
 They often live alone.
In addition, their mental state may not permit them to recognize when they
are becoming hypoglycemic.
Intensive diabetes treatment may not be possible when hypoglycemia is a fre-
quent problem. Using medications properly, as I discuss in the next section,
is essential to helping avoid hypoglycemia.
The hemoglobin A1c goal for healthy elderly adults is 7 percent. However, if
the life expectancy is less than 5 years, the elderly person is frail or the risks
of intensive therapy outweigh the benefits, the goal is 8 percent. This decreased
level of control will help to avoid hypoglycemia.
Using Medications
Medications that may lower blood glucose to abnormally low levels, such as
the sulfonylureas and insulin, are not the drugs of first choice in the elderly.
264
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

As I explain in the previous section, hypoglycemia hits elderly patients par-
ticularly hard and should be avoided if at all possible. With that goal in mind,
I explain the proper order of drug usage for elderly diabetics below. Each of
these medications is discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
Elderly people are often on several medications, and the monthly expense for
drugs may be great enough to cause them to skip doses or not buy the drug.
As I explain many times in this book, compliance with your treatment routine
is essential to good health. If you are not taking your diabetes medication(s)
as prescribed, you must let your doctor know.
 Metformin is probably the first drug to try because it does not increase
insulin secretion (which can lead to hypoglycemia) and because it is
inexpensive. Kidney function, which is decreased in the elderly, must be
checked when using this drug. The doctor should measure the level of
creatinine in the blood. If it is greater than 1.4 mg/dl in women or 1.5
mg/dl in men, it should not be used. The drug should be started at a low
dose of 500 mg and gradually raised over several weeks to avoid stom-
ach and intestinal problems.
 Actos also lowers blood glucose but not to hypoglycemic levels. When
metformin does not give enough control, Actos can be added. It does
tend to cause water retention, which is not good for an elderly person
with some heart or liver disease. It can be used at a low dose or taken
every two days to avoid this problem.
 Sulfonylureas are added when a third drug is needed. However, sulfony-
lureas can cause hypoglycemia — especially the older drug chlor-
propamide. The newer drugs in this category, such as glyburide and
glipizide, are preferred; glipizide may not cause hypoglycemia as often.
Your doctor should start you on half the usual dose and raise it slowly
over a number of weeks.
The newer sulfonylurea-like drugs called the meglitinides (repaglinide
and nateglinide) may have an advantage in the elderly because they do
not last as long. However, they cost a lot more than the others.
Drugs like acarbose have a very limited effect on the blood glucose and a lot
of intestinal side effects. I do not recommend their use in the elderly.
If pills fail to provide reasonable control of the blood glucose so that the
hemoglobin A1c is lower than 9, the patient must use insulin. A shot of glargine
at bedtime, combined with taking a pill during the day, often accomplishes
the desired level of control. In the worst cases, nighttime glargine and daytime
short-acting insulin before meals may be necessary, but this is extremely rare.
The infirmities of the elderly make insulin usage much more difficult. They
may not be able to see the dose or have the hand–eye coordination to draw
up the medication. Help from friends or family members becomes essential if
the elderly diabetic doesn’t live in a nursing facility. Premixed insulins and
prefilled insulin pens may make taking insulin a lot easier for these patients.

A new drug that may have a role in diabetes in the elderly is Byetta (see
Chapter 10). Two daily injections or the new once-a-week preparation may be
very helpful in achieving some weight loss and lowering of the blood glucose.
Dealing with Eye Problems
Elderly people with diabetes are at risk for the eye problems brought on by
the disease, and these problems can affect all aspects of proper diabetes
care. Older patients often get cataracts, macular degeneration, and open
angle glaucoma in addition to diabetic retinopathy (see Chapter 5).
Fortunately, the risk of developing eye diseases associated with diabetes has
been found to decrease as people get older, at every level of hemoglobin A1c.
For example, a 70-year-old with a hemoglobin A1c of 11 is at much lower risk
than a 60-year-old with the same hemoglobin A1c. The blood glucose of the
70-year-old does not need to be controlled as strictly.
An annual eye examination is recommended. One of the biggest failures in
diabetes care is that as many as one-third of the elderly never have an eye
examination at all. If no examination is done, how can disease be found when
it is early enough to treat? When problems are detected, they can be treated,
and the patient’s vision can be saved.
Coping with Urinary and 
Sexual Problems
Urinary and sexual problems are very common in elderly people with dia-
betes and greatly affect quality of life. An older person with diabetes may
experience paralysis of the bladder muscle so that urine is retained; when
the bladder fills, overflow incontinence is the result. Also, an older person
may be unable to get to the bathroom fast enough. Or, spasms in the bladder
muscle may lead to incontinence. The result may be frequent urinary tract
infections. A urologist may be able to help manage these difficulties.
Almost 60 percent of all men over the age of 70 are impotent, and 50 percent
have no libido (the desire to have sex). The percentages are even higher for
diabetic men. These problems can have many causes (see Chapter 6), but
older men are especially likely to have blockage of blood vessels with poor
flow into the penis. The elderly take an average of seven medications daily,
many of which affect sexual function.
266
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

To have sex at any age, you need sexual desire and the physical ability to per-
form, you need a willing partner, and you need a safe, private place. Any or all
of these may be missing for the elderly.
It is not always necessary to treat sexual dysfunction if the male and his part-
ner are okay with the situation. If they aren’t, Chapter 6 points out a number
of treatments for potency problems.
Considering Treatment Approaches
When deciding upon treatment for an elderly patient with diabetes, you first
have to consider the individual. Does this person have a low life expectancy?
Or is this person physiologically young, with the possibility of living for 15 or
20 more years? If the patient is only 65 years old and in relatively good
health, he or she has a life expectancy of at least 18 more years — plenty of
time to develop complications of diabetes, especially macrovascular disease,
eye disease, kidney disease, and nervous system disease (see Chapter 5).
That person may require more intensive diabetes care than someone who is
older and has worse overall health.
The level of care provided to an elderly patient may be basic or intensive:
 Basic care is meant to prevent the acute problems of diabetes like
excessive urination and thirst. You can accomplish this goal by keeping
the blood glucose under 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L). Basic care is used for
an elderly person with diabetes who is not expected to live very long,
either because of the diabetes or other illnesses.
 Intensive care is meant to prevent diabetic complications in an elderly
person expected to live long enough to have them. The goal here is to
keep the blood glucose under 140 mg/dl (7.7 mmol/L) and the hemoglobin
A1c as close to normal as possible while avoiding frequent hypoglycemia.
The benefits in terms of preventing complications of diabetes are much
greater when the hemoglobin A1c is lowered from 11 to 9 than when it is low-
ered from 9 to 7. The goal of treatment for many elderly people can be set
higher in order to avoid hypoglycemia in these more fragile patients.
Treatment always starts with diet and exercise. Education about both can be of
great value, especially if the patient’s spouse is also involved. I discuss diet in
the section “Preparing a Proper Diet,” earlier in this chapter, and in Chapter 8.
Exercise may be limited in the elderly person with diabetes. Recent studies
have shown that exercise is helpful even in the very old, because it reduces
267
Chapter 14: Diabetes and the Elderly

the blood glucose and the hemoglobin A1c. However, because elderly
patients have more coronary artery disease, arthritis, eye disease, neuropa-
thy, and peripheral vascular disease, exercise just may not be possible. (See
Chapter 9 for more on exercise.)
If an elderly patient can’t walk at all, he or she may still be able to do resis-
tance exercises sitting in a chair. These exercises increase strength and lower
the blood glucose.
When diet and exercise are inadequate to control an elderly patient’s dia-
betes, medications must be added. I discuss medications in the section
“Using Medications,” earlier in this chapter, and in Chapter 10.
Understanding the Medicare Law
In 1998, the federal government began to offer benefits for the 4.2 million
people with diabetes who are eligible for Medicare (over age 65). Under the
policy, all people with diabetes enrolled in Medicare part B or Medicare man-
aged care are eligible to receive coverage of glucose monitors, test strips, and
lancets. It does not matter which method they use to control their disease.
If you’re enrolled in Medicare, you can get these benefits by having your
physician prescribe the supplies and document how often you use them.
The Health Care Financing Administration, which administers Medicare, has
also passed regulations that permit people with diabetes to get reimbursed
for education programs. In addition, if you have Medicare insurance and have
type 1 diabetes, you are eligible for Medicare to pay for your insulin pump.
To find out more about Medicare, call the Medicare Hotline at 800-633-4227.
The government provides a hotline for the hearing-impaired at 877-486-2048.

A
fter we got his diabetes under control, one of my patients wrote to his
mother, “Dear Mom, I’m not working, but my pancreas is.” Most people
need to work, and some people even want to work. People need to work for
the same reason that a certain man did not turn in his brother-in-law who
thought he was a chicken. We need the eggs (though not too many).
As a person with diabetes, when you try to get a job, you may run into vari-
ous forms of discrimination. Part of the problem is the fear that the company
will have to pay higher insurance premiums if it hires a person with a chronic
illness. Part of the problem is a lack of understanding of the great strides that
have been made in diabetes care so that a person with diabetes often has a
better record of coming to work than a nondiabetic.
In this chapter, you find out what you need to know when you apply for work,
health insurance, and life insurance. You discover how to work the health care
system so that you derive the greatest benefits possible at the lowest cost.
Traveling with Diabetes
Whether you travel for your job or for pleasure, if you need insulin injections
and must carry syringes and needles, you have to follow the rules of the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) if you fly within the 50 United

States. Airlines outside the U.S. may have different rules; check with your air-
line before you travel overseas.
The TSA instructs that you should “make sure injectable medications are prop-
erly labeled (professionally printed label identifying the medication or a manu-
facturer’s name or pharmaceutical label). Notify the screener if you are carrying
a hazardous waste container, refuse container, or a sharps disposable container
in your carry-on baggage used to transport used syringes, lancets, etc.”
Updated information is available at the TSA Web site, www.tsa.gov/public/
display?theme=1. You can also call the TSA call center at 866-289-9673.
The TSA permits prescription liquid medications and other liquids needed by
persons with disabilities and medical conditions. This includes:
 All prescription and over-the-counter medications (liquids, gels, and
aerosols) including KY jelly, eye drops, and saline solution for medical
purposes
 Liquids including water, juice, or liquid nutrition or gels for passengers
with a disability or medical condition
 Life-support and life-sustaining liquids such as bone marrow, blood
products, and transplant organs
 Items used to augment the body for medical or cosmetic reasons such
as mastectomy products, prosthetic breasts, bras or shells containing
gels, saline solution, or other liquids
 Gels or frozen liquids needed to cool disability or medically related
items used by persons with disabilities or medical conditions
If the liquid medications are in volumes larger than 3 ounces each, they may
not be placed in the quart-size bag used for personal liquids of less than 3
ounces and must be declared to the Transportation Security Officer.
Specifically with respect to medications for diabetes, notify the Security
Officer that you have diabetes and are carrying your supplies with you. The
following diabetes-related supplies and equipment are allowed through the
checkpoint after they have been screened:
 Insulin and insulin loaded dispensing products (vials or box of individual
vials, jet injectors, biojectors, epipens, infusers, and preloaded syringes
 Unlimited number of unused syringes when accompanied by insulin or
other injectable medication
 Lancets, blood glucose meters, blood glucose meter test strips, alcohol
swabs, meter-testing solutions
 Insulin pump and insulin pump supplies (cleaning agents, batteries, plas-
tic tubing, infusion kit, catheter, and needle; nsulin pumps and supplies
must be accompanied by insulin)
270
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

 Glucagon emergency kit
 Urine ketone test strips
 Unlimited number of used syringes when transported in sharps disposal
container or other similar hard-surface container
 Sharps disposal containers or similar hard-surface disposal container
for storing used syringes and test strips
Knowing Where You Can’t Work
You may have grown up watching Eliot Ness on television and had your heart
set on being a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. If you require
insulin, forget it. The FBI has a policy called a blanket ban on hiring certain
groups of people, including people with diabetes who take insulin. A blanket
ban does not take into account the condition of the individual, the past employ-
ment history, the way the person manages his or her diabetes, or the responsi-
bilities of the position. It simply says, in effect, “You’ve got the disease, so you
can’t work here.” This policy is a throwback to the days before 1980, when a
person with diabetes could never be sure what his blood glucose was doing.
Another important institution that has a blanket ban in place is the United
States military. If you have any kind of diabetes, you are not eligible to serve.
If you develop diabetes after you’ve been in the military, you will probably be
given a discharge. This does not make a lot of sense because many countries
have people with diabetes in their military forces and have no difficulty with
them. And so it goes.
But fortunately, blanket bans are falling faster than Alex Rodriquez home
runs. For example, the Department of the Treasury lifted a blanket ban on
becoming a member of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms if you
have insulin-requiring diabetes. Recently, several states lifted a ban on hiring
people with diabetes to be school bus drivers. This action resulted from law-
suits against several school districts that fired drivers with spotless driving
records just because they had diabetes. (This does not mean that no safe-
guards against risky drivers exist. Drivers are being evaluated on a case-by-
case basis before they are accepted to drive children. This is fair.)
Previously commercial drivers could drive within a state but could not cross
state lines. Now the Department of Transportation (DOT) looks at people with
diabetes on a case-by-case basis to determine if it is safe for them to drive com-
mercially from state to state. As long as there is no history of hypoglycemia
with unconsciousness, the DOT grants an exemption that permits the individ-
ual to drive between states with reconsideration taking place every two years.
At one time, people with diabetes who took insulin were banned from becoming
firefighters. Now they, too, are permitted to serve in this work on a case-by-case
271
Chapter 15: Occupational and Insurance Problems

basis. However the rule says they must have a hemoglobin A1c of less than 
8 percent. This needs to be changed since people function perfectly well at
higher levels of hemoglobin A1c, even 10 or 11 percent. 
Another blanket ban that is falling is the ban on piloting airplanes. For 37 years,
a person who took insulin could not fly a plane. In 1996, the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) reconsidered its ban based upon the great advances in
controlling diabetes. The FAA decided to permit people to fly privately but
not for commercial airlines. Even if they have a private license, however, they
can’t use it outside the airspace of the United States. Applications for a pilot’s
license are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
Is there ever a justification for a blanket ban? The answer is no, and it has
been proved in a number of studies. In one study of accidents of all kinds,
people with diabetes actually had fewer accidents, including automobile acci-
dents, than groups of people without diabetes. In another study of people
over age 65 with diabetes, the rate of automobile accidents was no greater
than that of the nondiabetic groups.
Becoming Familiar with Workplace Law
A number of laws protect you in the workplace, but the most important is
probably the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. This act states,
The determination that an individual poses a ‘direct threat’ shall be based
on an individualized assessment of the individual’s present ability to safely
perform the essential functions of the job.
272
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 
Flying a plane: It’s not easy, but it’s worth it
Getting a pilot’s license is not easy but is well
worth the effort for the person who loves to fly.
To be successful, you must have no other dis-
qualifying conditions, such as arteriosclerotic
disease of the heart or brain, diabetic eye dis-
ease, or severe kidney disease (see Chapter 5).
You must have had no more than one hypo-
glycemic reaction with loss of consciousness in
the last five years and at least a year of stability
after that. You must be evaluated by a specialist
every three months after you get the license and
measure your blood glucose multiple times a
day. You must carry a glucose meter and meter
supplies in flight, along with supplies for rapid
treatment of hypoglycemia. Your blood glucose
must be between 100 and 300 mg/dl (5.5 to 16.6
mmol/L) a half hour before takeoff, every hour
of the flight, and a half hour before landing.
However, you’re not expected to measure your
blood glucose in flight if doing so interferes with
properly flying the plane. Phew! If Lindbergh
were diabetic, he never would have made it 
to Paris.

In 1998, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the ADA protects Americans with
diabetes. The act applies to employers with 15 or more employees. What the
ADA means is that you are qualified for a particular job if you can perform
the essential functions of the job as determined by the employer, with or
without reasonable accommodation. That means you can’t be discriminated
against in hiring, firing, promotion, training, pay, or any other aspect of
employment because you have diabetes. Your boss cannot ask whether you
have diabetes but can expect you to pass a physical examination to verify
that you are well enough to do the job.
The Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is an important law that protects you
when you apply for a federal job or a job in a company that receives federal
assistance. A person with diabetes is specifically protected under this law.
The most important provision states:
No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall,
solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program
or activity conducted by the Executive agency. . . .
Federal agencies have to prove that you will not be able to perform safely if
given the job. That is hard to do and puts the burden on them, not you. They
must decide on a case-by-case basis. As I note earlier in the chapter, the FBI
and the military are exempt from this law.
What can you do if you run into discrimination on the job due to your dia-
betes? You can contact the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC). You can find the nearest EEOC office on the Web at www.eeoc.gov/
offices.html or call 800-669-4000. You may have only 180 days from the
alleged discriminatory act to file the charge. 
Navigating the Health Insurance System
You can get insurance for your medical care several ways. This section
describes the most common forms.
Private insurance
If you or your child has diabetes, you can count on several things being true
when you interact with the medical insurance system in the United States.
You will pay more out-of-pocket than families without diabetes even when
you have coverage. And you may be denied coverage more often.
273
Chapter 15: Occupational and Insurance Problems

If you are an older adult with diabetes, you can expect to spend one and a
half times as much for medical care as a person without diabetes, although
Medicare pays for much of it. You want to be sure that you are not medically
shortchanged in an effort to save money.
The good news is that you can get health insurance just as often as the
person who does not have diabetes, although you may be turned down more
often. And the type of insurance you will have is the same as the nondiabetic
population: Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Health Maintenance Organizations
(HMOs), CHAMPUS, and so on.
Currently, there are two major forms of payment for medical care — fee-for-
service and capitated payment — with a lot of hybrids in between. The old
fee-for-service method pays the medical provider — whether a physician, a
lab, or a hospital — based on the number of services provided. More serv-
ices and procedures mean more profit for the provider. So the incentive is to
do more in order to make more money. (Not that providers would ever do
more than is necessary for the money.)
The other main method of reimbursement is capitation. Here the provider
gets a fixed amount of money for each patient. The risk is divided among
many patients so that if one costs more, ideally another will cost less. This is
the basis of the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), which hires physi-
cians to provide the care. HMOs look to enroll people who cost as little as
possible for their medical care. The incentive is to do less in order to save
money, which is then kept by the provider. (Not that providers would ever do
less than is necessary for the money.)
Because they seem to end up costing less money overall, capitation plans are
growing while fee-for-service plans are declining. The government is even
encouraging HMOs to enroll Medicare recipients in order to reduce costs. At
the same time, the government requires HMOs to enroll people who cost
more, like most people with diabetes.
As a healthcare consumer, you want to look for a large group because such a
group can spread out your extra expenses among many people who don’t
consume as much medical care. Before you sign up, ask several questions:
 What is your total annual cost, and how often is a payment required?
 Is there a deductible, meaning that you have to pay the first so many dol-
lars before the insurance starts paying?
 Is there a co-payment, meaning that every time you use a provider, you
have to pay some dollars?
 Does your plan pay for durable medical equipment like an insulin pump
(see Chapter 10), which can be very expensive? (You want to ask this
even if, when you sign up, you may not foresee a need for it.)
274
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

 Will your plan pay for your diabetes medication and diabetes supplies,
and to what extent?
 Can your physician order any medications you need, or is he or she
restricted to certain medications?
 How often will you need to travel to the pharmacy to pick up medica-
tions? (Some plans make you go back every 30 days.)
 Are you covered for specialists, particularly eye doctors and foot doctors?
 Are you limited to certain hospitals, certain physicians, and certain labo-
ratories? (If so, this may be much more inconvenient for you, not to
mention possibly requiring you to change from a physician with whom
you are very comfortable.)
 Is home health care included in the plan, and to what extent?
Each state has its own laws concerning the way medical insurance is offered
in that state. Some states allow medical underwriting, where a company can
refuse to insure a person with a particular medical condition. Other states
forbid this. To learn the rules and regulations in your state, go to the site of
the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute at www.healthinsurance
info.net/. Here you can enter your state and find out the latest rules. You
can also get a copy of its publication “A Consumer Guide For Getting and
Keeping Health Insurance.” Don’t even think about health insurance without
going here.
After you sign up for a plan, you need to be vigilant to be sure you are getting
what you paid for. You and your physician may need to make many phone
calls to get what you need, but if you persist you can often come away with a
“Yes.” Even goods and services that are excluded in your original contract
may be provided by the insurance company if you are persistent.
Insurance for low income patients
If your income falls below certain levels that are listed at the government
Web site: www.cms.hhs.gov/home/medicaid.asp.
you may be eligible for health insurance for low income patients called
Medicaid. Each state sets its own guidelines and administers the program for
itself. You obtain a card that shows you are eligible and take it to your doctor,
lab or hospital.
Because the reimbursement under Medicaid is generally so low, many doc-
tors will not accept patients whose only source of insurance is Medicaid.
Inform the receptionist when you make the appointment that you have this
insurance in order to avoid an unnecessary trip.
275
Chapter 15: Occupational and Insurance Problems

High-risk pools
About 60 percent of the US population gets its health insurance through their
employer in a group health program. Another 27 percent gets its insurance
through government programs like Medicare, Medicaid, military health care
and native American care. The rest are self-employed or work for a small
company that does not provide insurance. They can get insurance at a high
premium, usually, but there are some who have had a chronic medical condi-
tion and can’t find insurance at any price.
For those people about 34 states have formed pools of clients who can’t get
insurance anywhere else. The premium is usually higher than private insur-
ance but at least they can get insurance.
To find out if you qualify and where the locations of the state high-risk pools are
on the Internet, go to the Health Insurance Research Center at: www.health
insurance.org/riskpoolinfo.lasso.
Changing or Losing a Job
One of the major reasons people with diabetes used to stay in jobs they did
not care for was their fear of losing their health insurance. This does not
have to stop you in today’s job market. Several laws protect you from the
loss of health insurance if you change or lose your job.
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) stipulates that
your employer must keep you on your current health insurance for as long as
18 months after your job ends and longer if you are disabled. If your child is
at the age when he or she is no longer covered under your policy, the child’s
coverage can continue for up to three years. You, rather than your employer,
have to pay the premiums for this continued insurance.
If you are leaving work because of retirement at age 65, sign up for Medicare
without fail. It is a generous program (which you supported while you were
working) that recognizes the specific needs of people with diabetes. Since
1998, Medicare has expanded its coverage to include blood glucose monitors
and test strips once your physician certifies the need. It also offers payment
for specific types of outpatient diabetes education programs, as long as they
are considered necessary by your physician. And recently it has begun to pay
for nutrition counseling and eye examinations. The program is not entirely
enlightened, however, because while it will pay for an insulin pump, it still
does not cover insulin and syringes. To find out more about Medicare, call
the Medicare Hotline at 800-633-227. The government provides a hotline for
the hearing-impaired at877-486-2048.
276
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

Some employers have conversion policies that allow you to stay with your
insurance company if you leave work, but with individual rather than group
coverage. These policies can be pretty expensive.
Some states offer “Pooled Risk” health insurance for people who have lived in
the state a certain number of months but can’t get group or individual cover-
age. Check with your state insurance office.
Considering Long-Term Care Insurance
We are living longer and longer, especially those of us with diabetes, and 
we are going to need a way to pay for our care when we can no longer pay
health insurance premiums. When you are 90, your 88-year-old wife will 
most likely not be in a position to pay for your insurance, nor will your 
65-year-old daughter. Medicare does not cover most of your long-term care
expenses. Medicaid does cover some long-term care, but not everything 
you may need. This is where long-term insurance may help, if you can 
afford it.
If you have plenty of money and want to protect it from the financial hit of a
long-term illness, long-term insurance is for you. If you have little money, the
years of premiums are going to wipe out your savings, and you may end up
needing to drop the policy before you even use it.
One big problem is that many companies that sell long-term insurance will
not cover a person with diabetes. If you can get this type of insurance cover-
age while you are still working, you may be able to get into a large group
where your particular illness is not considered and the premiums may be rel-
atively low. However, you’ll obviously be paying those premiums for a longer
time than if you start coverage when you are older.
Before you buy, you should check several important features of a long-term
care insurance policy:
 What are the benefit triggers, the physical limitations that trigger cover-
age? To make this determination, generally insurance companies look at
activities of daily living, such as the ability to bathe yourself, dress your-
self, eat without help, go to the bathroom, and get out of bed. When you
can’t perform one or more of these, benefits begin.
 How much of the cost of care will the insurance pay, some or all?
 What levels of care does the policy provide? Your policy may offer cov-
erage only for adult day care services or may cover anything up to and
including living in a nursing facility.
277
Chapter 15: Occupational and Insurance Problems

 Is a waiver of premiums built in so that you don’t have to pay premiums
when you are disabled?
 Is the policy guaranteed renewable so you can renew no matter whether
you use it, although the premiums will be higher?
Whatever you do, if you buy long-term care insurance, make sure you take
good care of yourself so you live long enough to get some benefit from it.
Shopping for Life Insurance
As you might expect, the situation with life insurance and the person with
diabetes is in a state of flux. Insurance companies like to calculate your
chance of dying and charge you (or turn you down) based upon those calcu-
lations. Many companies are using calculations based on the life span of
people with diabetes in 1980 or before. Using those statistics, diabetics
clearly died earlier than their nondiabetic friends. Thus, the cost of life insur-
ance is greater for people with diabetes than nondiabetics.
As new studies are done, they should indicate that the life spans of people
with diabetes and nondiabetics are approaching equality. In some cases,
people with diabetes, who take better care of themselves than people with-
out a chronic illness, are living even longer. So the situation is improving, and
insurance companies will catch up sooner or later. Can you imagine the sur-
prise if insurance companies were ever to charge people with diabetes less
than others because of their good habits?
Insurance companies look at levels of blood glucose and the hemoglobin A1c.
Try to get yourself in excellent control before you apply. You could save a
bundle or get your insurance much more easily. 
With the Internet, you can quickly find and compare the cost of insurance at
numerous companies based on your age; your habits (warning: if you smoke,
you pay through the nose); and the presence of conditions such as diabetes,
high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Many companies will take a stan-
dard rate for a healthy person with no diseases and add 50 percent more if
you have diabetes. Of course, your actual cost is dependent on your specific
circumstances, including your age when you first buy the insurance.

and lower your cholesterol. In this edition I have the sad responsibility to
warn you about these same pharmaceutical companies.
As a consequence of my skepticism, I am not going to talk about new drugs

efforts to get cells that don’t usually make insulin to turn into the insulin-
producing beta cells. The Internet can help you to control your diabetes as
well and I tell you about that below.
Protecting Yourself from the 
Dangers of New Drugs
In an effort to instantly gratify their stockholders and find the next “billion
dollar drug,” drug companies seem to have lost sight of their major goal,
which is to find drugs that are both effective and safe for the treatment of 
diabetes. Although some drug companies continue to pursue this goal, many
of them are guilty of:

 Withholding studies that they have paid for that show that their drug is
not as effective as they claim. A study in the New England Journal of
Medicine in January 2008 showed that the companies that make antide-
pressants allowed 94 percent of positive studies to be printed but only
14 percent of negative studies. Even the positive studies, if carefully
evaluated, were not nearly as positive as the companies claimed. This
behavior is not limited to companies that make antidepressants.
 Strongly advertising the one study that shows positive effects when
many others show negative effects.
 Withholding studies that indicate their drug may have dangerous side
effects.
 Promoting their drug for purposes that are not permitted by the FDA.
 Advertising their drug as though it is the best or only treatment when
older and better treatments exist.
 Providing catered lunches and other goodies to doctors to convince
them to use their drugs. There is a basic conflict of interest in the 
relationship of doctors and pharmaceutical companies.
 Paying large sums of money to private doctors to do “studies” of their
drugs, studies that rarely find negative things about the drugs.
 Paying rebates to private doctors to use their drugs, whether or not 
it is the best choice for the patient.
These problems are not limited to doctors and the pharmaceutical industry.
Any time “advisors” are also salespeople, they will advise the purchase of
what they sell. But just because it takes place in every industry does not
make it right. And in the medical industry it is often a matter of life or death.
What steps can you take to avoid the dangers I outline above? Here are a few
suggestions:
 Do not ask your doctor to prescribe new drugs that are heavily pro-
moted by advertising. Too few people have used them and too little time
has passed to truly know the potential of these new drugs.
 Don’t take samples from your doctor. Drug companies use samples to
get you and your doctor “hooked” on their drug. 
 Don’t ask for a drug just because a key organization like the American
Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association, the Endocrine
Society or many others promotes the drug. These organizations have
become big and fat from the money provided by those drug companies.
 The easiest and best policy is to wait several years before trying a new
drug. The drugs that are currently available are more than adequate to
control your blood glucose, your blood pressure and your cholesterol if
you take them as prescribed.

Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

Avoiding Diabetic Complications with DHEADHEA or dehydroepiandros-
terone is a substance that is found normally in the human body as a byprod-
uct of the production of certain hormones. A recent study in Diabetes Care in
November 2007 suggests that DHEA may have an important role in preven-
tion of complications of diabetes. Earlier in the book (see Chapter 5) I indi-
cated that production of advanced glycation end products (AGE) may play a
role in the complications of diabetes including eye disease, kidney disease
and nerve disease (neuropathy).
The authors of this article found that in recently diagnosed patients with
T2DM who were controlled with diet alone and did not have complications
there was evidence of significant AGE production. Giving DHEA produced a
50 percent reduction in markers of AGE production.
DHEA levels were restored to the levels found in young adults and the devel-
opment of complications was presumably reduced. This may be a promising
new treatment for both prevention of complications and progression of those
that have already developed.
Surgery and Not Conventional Therapy Cures T2DMIn Chapter 8 I discussed
bariatric surgery as a last ditch treatment for the heavy patient with T2DM.
Recent evidence suggests that this should be considered much earlier in the
disease and in patients who are not nearly as heavy.
In a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association in January 2008
the authors compared the results of laparoscopic gastric banding with con-
ventional weight loss therapy for the treatment of T2DM in recently diag-
nosed (less than 2 years) patients: 55 patients were divided into the two
groups; 73 percent of the operated group but only 13 percent of the conven-
tional group had a remission of T2DM with their treatment. The surgically
treated patients lost 21 percent of their weight while the conventional
patients lost only 5 percent. This is strong evidence for the early use of
surgery to bring diabetes under control, even in patients who are not 
grossly obese.
Red Wine to Defy Aging
Red wine has been promoted as a way to avoid heart attacks. It was 
suggested that the French people have a lower rate of heart attacks than
Americans because they drink red wine containing a chemical called 
resveratrol that is protective.
New evidence from two studies suggests that resveratrol can slow the 
aging process. In one from Harvard University, published in the Journal of 
the American Medical Association, middle-aged mice were fed a high-fat 
diet. Some were also given resveratrol while others were not. Those given
resveratrol were less likely to die early.
281
Chapter 16: What’s New in Diabetes Care

Another study from a group in France, published in Cell, similarly showed
that mice fed a high-fat diet and high doses of resveratrol were protected
from the metabolic syndrome (see Chapter 5) and did not gain weight 
compared to mice not fed resveratrol.
Don’t rush to your nearest wine shop, however. It has been calculated that 
a person would have to drink 750 bottles of wine a day to get the amount of
resveratrol fed the animals in these studies. You better get an early start!
Resveratrol or something else in red wine probably protects your heart, but
don’t drink more than two glasses a day and a total of ten a week or your
liver may be very unhappy.
Taking a Statin for All 
People With Diabetes
Some diabetes specialists suggest that all people with diabetes should be
taking a cholesterol-lowering drug from the group of drugs known as statins.
The drugs in this class include:
 Atorvastatin (brand name Lipitor)
 Lovastatin (brand name Mevacor)
 Pravastatin (brand name Pravachol)
 Simvastatin (brand name Zocor)
A study in the January 2008 issue of The Lancet would seem to put that ques-
tion to rest. The authors looked at numerous studies of the effects of statin
drugs on people with diabetes. 1,466 people with T1DM and 1,7220 people
with T2DM were evaluated in these various studies. They were observed for 
a mean follow-up of 4.3 years. They found that:
 There were 3,247 major occlusions involving the arteries in these
patients.
 For every millimole per liter reduction in LDL cholesterol there was a 9
percent reduction in deaths from any cause.
 For every millimole per liter reduction in LDL cholesterol there was a 21
percent reduction in major closures of arteries.
 There were reductions in heart attacks and deaths due to heart attacks,
and strokes due to closure of the arteries to the brain.
 After five years fewer people with diabetes who had taken a statin had
had a major closure of blood vessel.
282
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

The authors’ conclusion was that all people with diabetes should be on a
statin to protect against a blood vessel closure. I agree and have all my
patients with diabetes take one of the statin drugs. 
Correcting the Cause of Complications
When the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was published 
in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 1993, the study showed
that people with type 1 diabetes could be controlled “intensively” with multi-
ple daily shots of insulin. The better control resulted in a very significant
reduction in complications of diabetes like eye disease, kidney disease, and
nerve disease (see Chapter 5).
Some of the intensively treated patients did not achieve the lowering of
hemoglobin A1c to 7 percent, Yet the patients who were intensively treated
and still had a hemoglobin A1c of 9 percent had fewer complications than 
the conventionally treated patients who had a hemoglobin A1c of 9 percent.
The explanation was that the conventionally treated patients had much wider
swings in their blood glucose levels from low to high. It was suggested that
wider swings led to more complications than narrower swings in blood 
glucose. For 15 years this has been thought to be the case.
Recently I attended the 55th Postgraduate Course of the American Diabetes
Association in San Francisco. At that course two doctors debated whether it
was true that wide swings in blood glucose caused more complications than
more narrow swings. After the debate, the original statistician for the DCCT
spoke and said that in the near future a medical journal would be publishing
the information that the original statistics were incorrect. In fact, there is no
difference in the complication rate whether the blood glucose swings widely
or more narrowly, if the mean blood glucose is the same in both cases.
If you find that your blood glucose tends to swing widely, as long as your
mean blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c is 7 percent or less, you need not
worry that you are developing complications.
Using the Internet to Control Your DiabetesThe Internet is an amazing, 
information-gathering tool where you can find just about any information you
want, if you know how to look. It also provides a way to interact with experts
from a distance. A number of companies are using this faculty to help people
to lose weight (see Chapter 12). Now a company called Entra Health Systems
at: http://www.entrahealthsystems.com/index.html is using the
interactive nature of the Internet to help people with diabetes and their doc-
tors to control their blood glucose. Evaluation of the program is taking place
in the United Kingdom, where the basics of the program may be found at
http://myglucohealth.co.uk.
283
Chapter 16: What’s New in Diabetes Care

The program starts with a glucose meter that can upload the blood glucose
tests to its Internet site either via a cellphone connection or by connecting
the meter to your computer and uploading the results from there. The blood
glucose readings are managed by a data management system that allows you
or your doctor to see the trends in your glucose. When you can see what
time of day your glucose tends to be higher or lower, you can correct the
abnormalities by adjusting your medication, diet, and/or exercise.
The program goes further. You can set high and low levels for the blood glu-
cose as well as appropriate frequencies of testing. When the levels are too
high or too low a certain number of times in a certain number of days, both of
which your doctor can set, the program notifies you and your doctor to take
corrective action. Additionally, when you are not testing enough to manage
your diabetes correctly, the program notifies you and your doctor of that.
The site allows you to build an online medical record that can be examined
by any doctor to whom you give permission. You can add information about
your diet, exercise, hypoglycemic reactions, and so forth.
Once it is available in the United States, this program may allow you and your
doctor to make much better use of all the tests that you do in a much more
timely fashion. It also permits secure communication between you and your
physician.
Getting Cells to Make Insulin
Dr. Lijun Yang, an associate professor at the University of Florida College of
Medicine, has come up with a unique and promising way to produce insulin-
secreting cells. She has been able to synthesize a protein called recombinant
Pdx1. This protein has the ability to regenerate beta cells in the pancreas 
and turn liver cells into insulin-producing beta cells. So far the protein has
worked successfully in mice. Mice with T1DM given this protein began to 
produce insulin for the first time. The mice no longer have diabetes after
receiving this protein. It has caused no adverse effects in the mice.
Dr. Yang has been able to synthesize the human form of this protein. She is
about to undertake a study of humans with T1DM to see if she can regenerate
sufficient cells in them to allow them to be free of insulin injections. If it
works and the body does not reject these insulin-producing cells as it did the
beta cells, this could be a cure for T1DM.

Understanding the Importance 
of the ACCORD Study
The ACCORD study is a study of 10,250 people who have had T2DM and 
are at high risk to have a heart attack. The average hemoglobin A1c was 8.2
percent, which is higher than the average patient with T2DM. The patients
were randomized into two treatment arms, a standard treatment arm that
had a goal of an A1c target between 7 and 7.9 percent and an intensive 
treatment arm that had a goal of an A1c target less than 6 percent.
All patients already had known heart disease and at least two other risk 
factors besides diabetes including:
 High blood pressure
 High cholesterol
 Obesity
 Smoking
When patients with these characteristics are allowed to maintain their usual
A1c of 8.2 percent, their death rate is 50 per 1000 patients per year.
The study was due to be completed in 2010, but in early February 2008, the
researchers announced that they were closing the part of the study that
attempted to get the A1c down to 6 percent because there was a higher death
rate among the intensively treated patients than the other group. The results
up to that point were:
 The intensive group had an average A1c of 6.4 percent.
 The standard group had an average A1c of 7.5 percent.
 The standard group had a death rate of 11 per 1,000 patients per year.
 The intensive group had a death rate of 14 per 1,000 patients per year.
Therefore, although the death rate for both groups was far below the level for
these people with an A1c of 8.2 percent initially (11 or 14 versus 50 per
1,000), the intensively treated group that reached their goal had a slightly
greater death rate than the standard group that reached their goal. 
The moral of this story is not that intensive treatment is dangerous in T2DM,
but that intensive treatment in this population of high risk patients with heart
disease already and more risk factors is dangerous.
Note that the death rate for both groups is much lower than that of the
poorly treated patients. These patients are so sick that the difficulties 
285
Chapter 16: What’s New in Diabetes Care

associated with trying to keep their blood glucose at a level of 100 mg/dl all
the time may be too great.
The more you control your blood glucose early in diabetes, the less chance
that you will get to the point of the patients in this study.
Clarifying the A1cThe hemoglobin A1c is a key test in the evaluation of 
the person with diabetes. It is based on the laboratory that did the A1c for
the Diabetes Control and Complications Trials. All labs in the world are 
supposed to calibrate their testing machines to the results from that lab. 
Unfortunately, that lab measured hemoglobins A1a, A1b, and A1c. And the
units of measurement are a percent rather than an absolute number like the
average blood glucose. It is unfortunate because it is much easier to think in
terms of an absolute number than a percentage and people get an absolute
number from their glucose meter, not a percentage.
Now at the beginning of 2008 the American Diabetes Association and other
organizations have joined to use a new assay for the hemoglobin A1c that
only measures the A1c subfraction of the hemoglobin As. The result will,
therefore, be lower, but is a better measure of the A1c.
Beginning soon, the hemoglobin A1c will be expressed in three ways, the 
old hemoglobin A1c, the new, true hemoglobin A1c, and the average blood
glucose to which it corresponds. You will get a much clearer picture of how
you are doing over time.
But don’t get upset if the average blood sugar that you get from your meter 
is very different from the measured average blood glucose. Remember that
your few blood glucose levels represent a few dots on a large painting. With
just that much information, you can hardly expect to know what the whole
picture looks like.

What Doesn’t Work When

E
veryone wants a quick and easy solution to their problems. For every
problem, five people offer a quick and easy answer. Just send in the
money. These cheats have got what it takes to take what you’ve got.
Being fooled by these claims may be a lot more serious for you than for 
the person who walked up to the man dressed as a polar bear who was pro-
moting soft drinks in a shopping center. The first man said: “Don’t you feel
foolish, dressed like a bear?” The “bear” replied: “Me, foolish? You’re the 
one talking to a bear.”
This chapter tells you as much as I know about diabetes tests and treatments
that don’t work. Don’t expect to find every “wonder cure” for diabetes that
you’ve read or heard about. As soon as this book is published, new, more
seductive claims will be made. I hope that you will remain skeptical, use the
information in this chapter to test claims out, and check with your doctor
before you try something that may do more harm than good.
Developing a Critical Eye
Many clues can alert you that a treatment may not work. Here are a few:
 If a treatment is endorsed by a Hollywood star or a basketball player
or other sports figure, be highly skeptical. Always consider the source
and make sure that it’s reputable. In this case, the fame of the star is
being used to convince you, not any special knowledge that he or she
possesses.

 If the treatment has been around for a long time but is not generally
used, don’t trust it. If a treatment has been around for a while and really
works, it will have been tried in an experimental study where some
people take it and some don’t. Doctors and medical texts recommend
drugs that pass that test.
 If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. An example would be the
claims about chromium improving blood glucose levels. The study that
“proved” it was done on chromium-deficient people, a situation that
does not exist in the United States.
 Anecdotes are not proof of the value of a treatment or test. The favor-
able experiences of one or a few people are not a substitute for a scien-
tific study. Perhaps those people did respond to the drug, but it may
have been for entirely different reasons.
A lot of information about diabetes is available on the Web. In Appendix C, I
provide the best resources currently available for diabetes from this amazing
source. The same rules apply when you consider the validity of claims made
on the Web, with a few extra rules thrown in:
 Don’t rely on search engines for validity. Search engines do not check
claims for validity.
 Go to the site of the claim and see whether most of the information
there makes sense. If you find a lot of silly information, that should be a
red flag. If you still feel the treatment might work, ask the Webmaster for
references. If none are forthcoming, forget about the idea.
 Go to sites that you know are reliable to see whether you can find the
same recommendations. The treatments discussed on sites like the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) and The Diabetes Monitor (see
Appendix C) can be relied upon. When a treatment’s value is uncertain,
these sites can usually tell you.
 Go to medical conferences put on by reputable experts. You will be
given Web addresses that are reliable. Another reliable source for such
addresses is a book by Warner V. Slack, Cybermedicine: How Computing
Empowers Doctors and Patients for Better Health Care. Although the last
edition was 2001, it remains an excellent resource for online medical
information.
Identifying Drugs That Don’t Work
In the past decade, so many drugs have been touted as the cure for diabetes
that you would think everyone would be cured by now. The fact is, as I say
again and again, you do have the tools right now to control diabetes, but the
288
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

solution is not as simple as taking a pill. If it were, this book would not be
necessary. In this section, I tell you about some drugs that have received
unwarranted hype because they “worked” in a few people.
If you participate in a clinical research study of a new drug, a system is in
place to protect you. Make sure that the study has been approved by a
review board in an institution that has been approved to do the research.
Such institutions are usually accredited by an established organization like
the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research.
See the sidebar “How the ADA evaluates new drugs” for information on how
the American Diabetes Association evaluates new treatments.
Chromium
You can find articles singing the praises of chromium for controlling the
symptoms of diabetes in all kinds of magazines and newspapers, and on the
Internet. Should you take supplements of chromium?
The strongest case for chromium comes from a study of people with type 2
diabetes in China. They were given high doses of chromium and were found
to improve their hemoglobin A1c, blood glucose, and cholesterol while reduc-
ing the amount of insulin they had to take. However, these people were
chromium deficient in the first place. People in the United States and other
countries where the diet is sufficient in chromium do not have this deficiency
and do not show improvement in glucose tolerance when they take
chromium. In addition, chromium is present in such small amounts normally
that it is hard to measure even in people without chromium deficiency.
289
Chapter 17: What Doesn’t Work When You Treat Diabetes
How the ADA evaluates new drugs
The American Diabetes Association evaluates
new therapies and places them in one of four
categories:
 Clearly effective
 Somewhat/sometimes effective or effective
for certain categories of patients
 Unknown/unproven but possibly promising
 Clearly ineffective
If you’re about to try a new therapy that has not
been recommended by your doctor and is not 
discussed in this book, you may want to contact
the ADA and find out its position on the treatment.
Of course, if you’re involved in a clinical trial 
that is trying to determine the effectiveness of a
therapy, no one will know whether it works or not.

The exact amount of chromium you need in your diet is uncertain but is 
estimated to be 15 to 50 micrograms daily. People who take much more than
that tend to accumulate it in their livers, where it can be toxic. Some studies
suggest that chromium can cause cancer in high doses.
For now, the evidence does not support the use of chromium in diabetes
except for people who are known to be chromium deficient.
Aspirin
People who take the sulfonylurea drugs (see Chapter 10) sometimes have a
greater drop in blood glucose when they take aspirin. This is because aspirin
competes with the other drug for binding sites on the proteins that carry 
sulfonylureas in the blood. When they’re bound to protein, the sulfonylureas
are not active; when they’re free, they are. Aspirin knocks the sulfonylureas
off so that they’re free. As a result, aspirin has been recommended as a drug
to lower blood glucose.
By itself, aspirin has little effect on blood glucose. Its effect with sulfony-
lureas is so inconsistent that it can’t be reliably depended upon to lower 
the blood glucose.
Cinnamon
A number of articles in the medical literature since 2001 have suggested 
that cinnamon will lower the blood glucose in type 2 diabetes and improve
fat levels as well. To verify these claims a study called a meta-analysis was
done and published in Diabetes Care in January 2008. In a meta-analysis all
studies that are randomized so that the subjects don’t know if they are get-
ting the drug or a placebo are analyzed to see if they confirm the hypothesis.
In this case, none of five studies showed that cinnamon had a positive affect
either on the blood glucose or blood fats. You may have noticed the same
thing if you were taking a daily dose of a teaspoon of cinnamon. You can
cease and desist!
Pancreas formula
Pancreas formula is sold on the Internet as a mixture of herbs, vitamins, and
minerals that help diabetes. No clinical or experimental evidence shows that
pancreas formula does anything of value in the human body. The claims 
that are made for this “treatment” are not supported by factual evidence.
290
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

Fat Burner
You may hear and read a lot of advertising for the Fat Burner product in rep-
utable newspapers and on reputable radio stations. Advertising claims that
you can “burn fat without diet or exercise,” and they will even throw in,
ABSOLUTELY FREE, a bottle of Spirulina to enhance your Fat Burner weight
control program. If you believe this is possible, I have a bridge I would like to
sell you, cheap. In order to burn fat, you must exercise and stop taking in
large amounts of carbohydrates or other sources of calories.
Ki-Sweet
The literature for Ki-Sweet offers another lesson in being skeptical. The 
creators of this “miracle” sweetener claim that it has a “special designation
from the American Diabetes Association.” The ADA denies the claim, but how
many people will buy something when they see ADA approval and not bother
to see whether it’s true? No evidence exists that Ki-Sweet, made by squeezing
the juice of kiwi, has any advantages over other sweeteners (which I discuss
in Chapter 8).
Gymnema silvestre
Gymnema silvestre is a plant found in India and Africa that is promoted as 
a glucose-lowering agent as part of an alternative medical treatment called
Ayurvedic medicine. Gymnema silvestre has never been tested in a controlled
study in humans. One statement in its advertising is, “For most people, blood
sugar lowers to normal levels.” No evidence exists that this is the case.
291
Chapter 17: What Doesn’t Work When You Treat Diabetes
The facts about aspartame
Many news sources report that aspartame (see
Chapter 8) causes cancer. Because so many
people eat and drink products that contain
aspartame, I want to clarify.
Aspartame is an acceptable artificial sweetener
with no known dangers to human beings. No 
evidence shows that aspartame causes cancer
when used in normal amounts. The Food and
Drug Administration has an acceptable daily
intake for food additives, including a 100-fold
safety factor. It is inconceivable that anyone
would use more aspartame than that.

Avoiding Illegal Drugs
Drugs like cocaine, heroin, speed, and marijuana are not just illegal; they are
especially harmful for the person with diabetes for several reasons:
 Some make you excessively hungry, and you take in too many calories.
 All cause you to lose your awareness of hypoglycemia so you don’t 
treat it.
 All cause a loss of judgment that results in the failure to take medica-
tions, eat properly, and exercise.
 Some cause a reduced insulin response to food so you become 
hyperglycemic.
 Some cause you to lose your appetite so you become hypoglycemic 
and malnourished with vitamin deficiencies.
Not a lot of valid information is available about each illegal drug’s impact on
diabetes, because we cannot do studies where these drugs are given to one
group of diabetics while a control group takes a placebo. But we do know the
following:
 Marijuana (grass, weed, bud, cannabis) causes increased appetite,
which results in taking in too many calories.
 Amphetamine (speed, Dex, crank) and ecstasy (derived from ampheta-
mine and also called MDMA, E, X, adam, bean, and roll) increase the
body’s metabolic rate, resulting in hypoglycemia because the user often
does not eat properly and is unaware of the onset of low blood glucose.
 Cocaine (coke, snow, nose candy, dust, toot) and freebase cocaine
(crack, rock) lead to food deprivation, increased metabolism and caloric
needs, and vitamin deficiency.
 Heroin (dope, junk, smack) is similar to cocaine but has additional risks
associated with injections, such as infection.
Do you need any more reason to get high on exercise rather than drugs?
Knowing the Dangers 
of Some Legal Drugs
Just because a drug is legal does not mean it has no undesirable side effects.
Several classes of drugs need to be used with caution.
292
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

Antipsychotics
In an issue of Diabetes Care (February 2004), four major medical associations
warned that second-generation antipsychotic drugs, used to treat a variety 
of severe mental illnesses, can cause rapid weight gain, most of which is fat,
leading to prediabetes, diabetes, insulin resistance, and abnormal blood fats.
The drugs differ in their risks, but clozapine (Clozaril made by Novartis) 
and olanzapine (Zyprexa made by Eli Lilly) appear to be the worst offenders.
Other drugs named include risperadone (Risperdol made by Johnson &
Johnson), quetiapine (Seroquel made by AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon
made by Pfizer), and aripiprazole (Abilify made by Bristol-Myers Squibb).
If you are taking one of these drugs, ask your doctor to screen and monitor
you for evidence of weight gain and insulin resistance. The benefits of taking
the drug may outweigh the risks. In the article, the panel suggests that base-
line screening consisting of a medical history and physical examination along
with fasting glucose and blood fats be done before using the drug. 
If you are overweight or obese, you should receive nutritional and physical
activity counseling if you take one of these drugs. If you are at risk of devel-
oping diabetes, your doctor should use the drug that is least associated with
this problem.
AIDS medications
Certain drugs that control AIDS, called protease inhibitors, block the body’s
ability to store glucose so that people who use them may develop diabetes.
More than 80 percent of the people who use them develop excess stomach
fat, and half develop glucose intolerance. More than 10 percent develop 
diabetes. Table 17-1 shows the specific drugs with their brand names and
manufacturers.
293
Chapter 17: What Doesn’t Work When You Treat Diabetes
What about hypnosis?
As respected a source as the National Institutes
of Health has listed hypnosis as a treatment for
“stabilization of blood sugar in diabetes.”
Although it has a disclaimer that says that pub-
lishing this statement does not imply endorse-
ment of the treatment, the fact that the
statement comes from the NIH gives this treat-
ment credibility. The only trouble is that no
experimental evidence exists that proves the
usefulness of hypnosis. So you have to be wary,
even when the advice comes from the most
respected of sources.

You should be screened before starting these drugs, and your doctor should
monitor you carefully for weight gain and glucose intolerance. If diabetes
does develop, the protease inhibitors are continued and the diabetes is
treated. So far, none of the protease inhibitors stands out as more likely to
cause diabetes.
Recognizing Diets That Don’t Work
For the overweight person with type 2 diabetes, any diet that causes some
weight loss helps for a time. But you have to ask yourself these questions:
 Am I prepared to stay on this diet indefinitely?
 Is this diet healthy for me in the long run?
 Does it combine all the features I need — namely weight loss, reduction
of blood glucose, and reduction of blood fat levels — with palatability
and reasonable cost?
If you can say yes to all these questions, the diet will probably work for you.
So how do you know which diets are healthy and effective, and which aren’t?
First, take a close look at Chapter 8, where I discuss diet in much more detail.
Next, develop a discerning eye for defects in the latest diet fads.
294
Part IV: Special Considerations for Living with Diabetes 

When you walk into a reasonably large bookstore, you may be overwhelmed
by the number of diet books. But the more books that are written about this
subject, the less we seem to know for certain. Why would authors bother to
write dozens of new books on dieting each year if the solution rested in some
older book? You can bet that word of mouth would have made that book the
all-time bestseller in any category.
The diet books in print these days are way too numerous to list here, but
they can be grouped into a few categories:
 Diets that promote a lot of protein with little carbohydrate: The trou-
ble with these diets is that they’re not a healthy and balanced approach.
Unless you use tofu as your source of protein, you will be getting a lot of
fat in your diet, much of it saturated fat. That is not good for you. The
diet is lacking in vitamins that a supplemental vitamin pill may or may
not provide. Few people stay on such a diet for long. How many people
can eat chicken for breakfast, lunch, and supper? The diet is also lacking
in potassium, an essential mineral.
People who do follow this kind of diet for a long time also find that they
have problems with hair loss, cracking nails, and dry skin. Their breath
and their urine smell of acetone because of all the fat breakdown. They
become very dry and need to drink large quantities of beverages.
I see a place for this diet as a starter. Some people with type 2 diabetes
who have high blood glucose levels show rapid improvement when
started on a diet like this. As the glucose comes under control, the diet
can be changed to a more balanced one.
 Diets that promote little or no fat: The people who can follow a diet 
that is less than 20 percent fat deserve a new designation — fatnatics
(fat fanatics). This kind of diet is extremely difficult to prepare and per-
haps even more difficult to eat unless you’re a squirrel. In order to make
up the calories, people on this diet eat large amounts of carbohydrates.
Chapter 8 makes it clear why this is not a good idea for people with 
diabetes.
Like the protein diet, this diet may be lacking in essential vitamins and
minerals, especially the fat-soluble vitamins. Rarely do people stay on
such a diet after they leave the confines of a spa or other sanctuary
where the diet is promoted. However, this approach may also be a good
way to start a dietary program for a person with type 2 diabetes, as 
long as the total calories are not greater than the daily needs of that
individual.
 Very low calorie diets: These diets require taking in food and drinks
that contain less than 800 kilocalories daily (and generally do not taste
very good). They are lacking in many essential nutrients and must be
supplemented by vitamins and minerals. This approach cannot form the
basis of a permanent diet because the dieter would eventually become
295
Chapter 17: What Doesn’t Work When You Treat Diabetes

emaciated. Most dieters who start this kind of program do not last on it
and regain every ounce they have lost and then some. (There are always
exceptions, of course.)
I do not like this kind of diet even as a starter diet because it is so 
unlike our usual eating habits that people rapidly find it to be intol-
erable. Eating is a basic part of our existence, and it’s a source of 
great pleasure for human beings and other animals. A diet that takes
away this fundamental activity cannot be tolerated for very long.
The transition from a very low calorie diet to a balanced diet is very 
difficult and rarely succeeds.

Chapter 18
Ten Ways to Prevent or Reverse
the Effects of Diabetes
In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of monitoring, dieting, testing, and exercising
 Solidifying prevention with medication, the right attitude, and planning
W
hen I originally wrote this chapter, there were 20 things you had to 
do in order to prevent or reverse the effects of diabetes. I decided
that was too much to ask of you, so I reduced it to ten. Surely you can do
everything in this chapter when you consider that it is only half as difficult!
Can you pick and choose what you will do? No. Everything here is essential
to living a long and high quality life with diabetes. You wouldn’t want to 
save your sight and lose your kidneys. So read this chapter very carefully 
and practice every recommendation. And if you think I should have left any
of the other ten behaviors in, let me know.
Major Monitoring
You have this incredibly compact and accurate glucose meter. Now you want
to use it to find out how your blood glucose is doing at any time of day or
night under any circumstances. You don’t feel well. Is it low blood glucose or
the beginning of a cold? Test! You just ate a large portion of pasta. Did it raise
your blood glucose too much? Test!You can monitor your glucose in so many
ways, almost without pain, that you have no excuse for not doing so. And you
don’t have to do it with a finger stick every time. Most meters allow you to do
it in other parts of your body, your arm, leg or abdomen for example, espe-
cially when the blood glucose would not be expected to change rapidly as it
would during or after exercise or after a meal. Those times you should only
use your finger.

People with type 1 diabetes need to test at least before meals and at bedtime
because their blood glucose level determines their dose of insulin. People
who have stable type 2 diabetes may test once a day at different times or
twice a day. If you’re sick or about to start a long drive, you may want to test
more often because you don’t want to become hypoglycemic — or hyper-
glycemic for that matter. The beauty of the meter is that you can check your
blood glucose in less than ten seconds any time you feel it’s necessary.
Devout Dieting
If you are what you eat, then you have the choice of being controlled or
uncontrolled depending upon what you put into your mouth. If you gain
weight, you gain insulin resistance, but a small amount of weight loss can
reverse the situation. The main point you should understand about a “dia-
betic diet” is that it’s a healthy diet for anyone, whether they have diabetes
or not. You should not feel like a social outcast because you’re eating the
right foods. You don’t need special supplements; the diet is balanced and
contains all the vitamins and minerals you require (although you want to 
be sure you’re getting enough calcium).
You can follow a diabetic diet wherever you are, not just at home. Every
menu has something on it that’s appropriate for you. If you’re invited to
someone’s home, let them know you have diabetes and that the amount 
of carbohydrate and fat that you can eat is limited. If that fails, limit the
amount that you eat. (See Chapter 8 for more on your diet.)
A person with T2DM who follows a careful diet can reduce his hemoglobin
A1c by 1 percent or more. This translates into a reduction in the occurrence
of complications like eye disease, kidney disease and nerve disease of more
than 25 percent. Is that worth your effort?
Tenacious Testing
The people who make smoke detectors recommend that you change the 
battery without fail each time you have a birthday. You should use the same
simple device to remember your “complication detectors.” Make sure that
your doctor checks your urine for tiny amounts of protein and your feet for
loss of sensation every year around the time of your birthday. It takes five to
ten years to develop complications of diabetes. When you know the problem
is present, you can do a lot to slow it down or even reverse it. Never has it
been truer that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” (For more
on complications that may develop, see Chapters 4 and 5.)
300
Part V: The Part of Tens 

I make it very easy for you to get the tests you need at the time you need
them. The cheat sheet at the front of this book gives you the current testing
recommendations. Make a copy for your doctor if he or she does not already
have such a list. Demand that you get the tests when they are due. A doctor
with a busy medical practice may forget whether you have had the tests you
need, but you don’t have an excuse for forgetting.
Enthusiastic Exercising
When you take insulin (as opposed to pills), controlling your diabetes is a
little harder because you have to coordinate your food intake and the activity
of the insulin. But I have patients who have had diabetes for decades and
have little trouble balancing their food and insulin. They are the enthusiastic
exercisers. They use exercise to burn up glucose in place of insulin. The
result is a much more narrow range of blood glucose levels than is true of the
insulin takers who do not exercise. They also have more leeway in their diet
because the exercise makes up for slight excesses.
I am not talking about an hour of running each day or 50 miles on the bike.
Moderate exercise like brisk walking can accomplish the same thing. The key
is to exercise faithfully. (For more on exercise, see Chapter 9.) Thirty minutes
of moderate exercise every day will not just improve your diabetes. It will
reduce the possibility of a stroke, a heart attack, many cancers, and just keep
you feeling generally good. Exercise can reduce your hemoglobin A1c by 1
percent or more just like diet. 
Lifelong Learning
When I see a patient new to me who has had diabetes for some time, I am
amazed at the lack of knowledge of many fundamental areas of their disease.
You would think that they would want to know anything that might help them
to live more comfortably and avoid complications.
So much is going on in the field of diabetes that I have trouble keeping up
with it, and it’s my specialty. How can you expect to know when doctors
come up with the major advances that will cure your diabetes? The answer is
lifelong learning. After you get past the shock of the diagnosis, you are ready
to learn. This book contains a lot of basic stuff that you need to know. You
can even take a good course in diabetes. Then you need to keep learning. 
Go to meetings of the local diabetes association. Become a member of the
American Diabetes Association and get its terrific magazine called Diabetes
Forecast, which usually contains the state of the art. Go to the Web sites that 
I discuss in Appendix C.
301
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Prevent or Reverse the Effects of Diabetes

I assume you want to learn or you would not have bought this book. (You did
buy it, didn’t you? It should sit on your shelf right next to your dictionary and
your encyclopedia.)
Remember that a lot of misinformation is available on the Web, so you must
be careful to check out a recommendation before you start to follow it (see
Chapter 17). Even information on reliable sites may not be right for your 
particular problem.
Above all, never stop learning! The next thing you learn may be the one that
will cure you.
Meticulous Medicating
Compliance, which means treating your disease in accordance with your
doctor’s instructions, is a term that has special relevance for the patient with
a chronic disease like diabetes who must take medications day in and day
out. Sure, it’s a pain (even if you could take insulin by mouth and not by injec-
tion). But the basic assumption is that you’re taking your medication. Your
doctor bases all his or her decisions on that assumption. Some very serious
mistakes can be made if that assumption is false. 
Check with your pharmacist to make sure that your pills don’t interfere with
one another. Some pills are taken with food; others are taken with no food for
a period before and after that medication. Taking them correctly is just as
important as taking them at all.
Every time a study is done on why patients’ health conditions do not
improve, compliance is high up or leads the list of reasons. Do you make a
conscious decision to skip your pills, or do you forget? Whatever the reason,
the best thing to do is to set up a system so that you’re forced to remember.
Keeping your pills in a dated container quickly shows you if you have taken
them or not. You might even divide the pills by time of day. 
Appropriate Attitude
Your approach to your disease can go a long way toward determining
whether you will live in diabetes heaven or diabetes hell. If you have a posi-
tive attitude, treating diabetes as a challenge and an opportunity, not only is
it easier for you to manage your disease, but your body actually produces
chemicals that make it happen. A negative attitude, on the other hand,
results in the kind of pessimism that leads to failure to diet, failure to exer-
cise, and failure to take your medications. Plus, your body makes chemicals
that are bad for you when you are depressed.
302
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Diabetes is a challenge because you have to think about doing certain things
that others never have to worry about. It brings out the quality of organiza-
tion, which can then be transferred to other parts of your life. When you’re
organized, you accomplish much more in less time.
Diabetes is an opportunity because it forces you to make healthy choices for
your diet as well as your exercise. You may end up a lot healthier than your
neighbor without diabetes. As you make more and more healthy choices, you
feel and test less and less like a person with diabetes. 
Preventive Planning
Life is full of surprises. Like the sign on a display of “I Love You Only”
Valentine cards: Available in Multipacks. You never know when you will get
more than you bargained for. That is why having a plan to deal with the unex-
pected is so important. Say you’re invited to someone’s home, and they serve
something that you know will raise your blood glucose significantly. What 
do you do? Or you go out to eat and are given a menu of incredible choices,
many of which are just not for you. How do you handle that? You run into
great stress at work or at home. Do you allow it to throw off your diet, your
exercise, and your drug taking?
Does your mother make the wrong things when you go over to her house for
a meal? Do you eat out a lot at fast food places and make poor choices. A
little advance planning can overcome any eating challenge. Discuss good
foods with your mother. Check out the calorie breakdown of the foods you
eat at fast food places, usually available on the Internet. Go to the Web site of
the particular restaurant and you will be directed to pages that show the
calorie breakdown for all their foods. Make a diet for yourself and follow it.
The key to these situations is the realization that it’s not possible for every-
thing to go right all the time. In the case of the friend who cooked the wrong
thing for you, you can at least eat a small portion to limit the damage. At the
restaurant, you should come prepared with the food choices you know will
keep you on your diet. It may be better not to look at the menu and simply
discuss with your waiter what is available from your list of correct foods . 
Fastidious Foot Care
A recent headline read: “Hospital sued by seven foot doctors.” I would cer-
tainly not like to treat any doctor with seven feet or even a doctor who is
seven feet tall. Whether you have two feet or seven feet, you must take good
care of them. The problem occurs when you can’t feel with your feet because
of neuropathy (see Chapter 5). You can easily know when this problem exists
303
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Prevent or Reverse the Effects of Diabetes

just by checking with a 10-gram filament. If your feet cannot feel the filament,
they will not feel burning hot water, a stone, a nail in your shoe, or an
infected ulcer of your foot.
When you lose sensation in your feet, your eyes must replace the pain fibers
that would otherwise tell you there is a problem. You need to carefully exam-
ine your feet every day, keep your toenails trimmed, and wear comfortable
shoes. Your doctor should inspect your feet at every visit.
Diabetes is the primary source of foot amputations, but this drastic situation
is entirely preventable if you pay attention to your feet. Test bath water by
hand, shake your shoes out before you put them on, wear new shoes only a
short while before checking for pressure spots, get a 10-gram filament and
see whether you can feel it. If you smoke, you are especially at a high risk for
an amputation of your toes or foot. The future of your feet is in your hands.
The other aspect of fastidious foot care is making sure the circulation in the
blood vessels of your feet remains open. This is done by your doctor per-
forming an ankle-brachial index (see Chapter 5). This test should be done
once a year and quickly tells you and your doctor if you’re experiencing a
problem with your circulation.
Essential Eye Care
You’re reading this book, which means you are seeing this book. So far, there
are no plans to put out a Braille edition, so you had better take care of your
eyes or you will miss out on the wonderful gems of information that brighten
every page.
Caring for your eyes starts with a careful examination by an ophthalmologist
or optometrist. You need to have an exam at least once a year (or more often
if necessary). If you have controlled your diabetes meticulously, the doctor
will find two normal eyes. If not, signs of diabetic eye disease may show up
(see Chapter 5). At that point, you need to control your diabetes, which
means controlling your blood glucose. You also want to control your blood
pressure because high blood pressure contributes to worsening eye disease,
as does high cholesterol.
Although the final word is not in on the effects of excessive alcohol on eye
disease in diabetes, is it worth risking your sight for another glass of wine?
Smoking has definitely been shown to raise the blood glucose in diabetes.
Even at a late stage, you can stop the progression of the eye disease or
reverse some of the damage if you stop smoking now.

Ten Myths about Diabetes 
That You Can Forget
In This Chapter
 Separating diabetes fact from fiction
 Being wise about your medical care
M
yths are a lot of fun. They’re never completely true, but you can usu-
ally find a tiny bit of truth in a myth. The trouble is that some myths
can hurt you if you allow them to determine your medical care. This chapter
is about those kinds of myths — the ones that lead you to fail to take your
medication or stay on your diet, or even lead you to take things that may not
be good for you.
Perfect Treatment Yields 
Perfect Glucoses
Doctors are probably as responsible as their patients are for the myth that
perfect treatment results in perfect glucose levels. For decades, doctors mea-
sured the urine glucose and told their patients that if they would just stay on
their diet, take their medication, and get their exercise, the urine would be
negative for glucose. Doctors failed to account for the many variables that
could result in a positive test for glucose in the urine, plus the fact that even
if the urine was negative, the patient could still be suffering diabetic damage.
(The urine becomes negative at a blood glucose of 180 mg/dl [10 mmol/L] in
most people, a level that still causes damage.)
The same thing is true for the blood glucose. Although you can achieve
normal blood glucose levels most of the time if you treat your diabetes 

properly, you can still have times when, for no apparent reason, the glucose
is not normal. So many factors determine the blood glucose level at any given
time that this should hardly be a surprise. These factors include
 Your diet
 Your exercise
 Your medication
 Your mental state
 Other illnesses
 The day of your menstrual cycle
You Can Have Borderline 
Diabetes for Years
Borderline diabetes does not exist! Borderline diabetes does not exist any
more than borderline pregnancy or borderline stealing. Either you have dia-
betes or you don’t. You have it if your fasting blood glucose is greater than or
equal to 126 mg/dl on more than one occasion or your glucose after eating is
greater than or equal to 200 on more than one occasion.
Forget about this “borderline” stuff. Go ahead and lose some pounds and
start an exercise program or increase it if you already do something, Not only
will you prevent diabetes if you don’t have it already or decrease the damage
it does if you do, but your health in general will take a giant step in a positive
direction.
Unorthodox Methods Can Cure Diabetes
In Chapter 17, I talk about some treatments that don’t work. Those treat-
ments are just the tip of the iceberg. Many treatments do not help you and
may hurt you. Whenever a problem affects a huge number of people, others
are eager to exploit this potential gold mine.
How can you know if what you read in your favorite magazine or see on the
Internet is actually useful? Check it out with your physician, your diabetes
educator, or other members of your team (see Chapter 11). They will know or
can find out for you about any appropriate treatment. To date, diabetes has
no simple cures. A book or organization that promises an easy cure is not
doing you any favor.
306
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You Can Tell the Level of Your Blood
Glucose by How You Feel
Many of my patients have claimed that they can tell their blood glucose level
by how they feel, and I have challenged them to prove it. Guess who wins
every time with the exception of significant hypoglycemia? Sure, if your
blood glucose is below 50 mg/dl and you are sweaty and have palpitations
and a headache, you know that you are low — but even then, you don’t know
how low. Therefore, you don’t know how much treatment to give yourself to
bring it back up, but not too high.
Those who don’t test and rely on the way they feel will suffer one or several of
the short term and long term complications described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. 
Patients with high blood glucose rarely can tell within 50 mg/dl what their
level is. Less than half of patients who guess come close to the correct answer.
Measure your glucose a couple of times daily if you have type 2 diabetes and
before meals and at bedtime if you have type 1 diabetes. The more informa-
tion you gather, the better will be your glucose control and the more likely
you will be to minimize or avoid complications.
Hypoglycemia Kills Brain Cells
Hypoglycemia (see Chapter 4) often comes on fast and leaves you with a
headache or a general feeling of weakness and sometimes confusion. Because
of this, people have believed that low blood glucose, especially if it occurs
repeatedly, may destroy mental functioning. People who have had repeated
episodes of hypoglycemia have shown no loss of mental functioning. Children
may have different results because their brains are still developing.
Fortunately, your body is supplied with hormones to reverse hypoglycemia.
Some things you can do to prevent it include checking your blood glucose
prior to heavy exercise and keeping a supply of rapidly absorbable glucose
nearby. Also, let coworkers and loved ones know about your diabetes and
how to recognize hypoglycemia. If you’re prone to frequent low blood 
glucose, wear an ID bracelet.
If You Need Insulin, You’re Doomed
Many people with type 2 diabetes believe that once they have to take insulin,
they’re on a rapid downhill course to death. This is not so. If you’re using
307
Chapter 19: Ten Myths about Diabetes That You Can Forget

insulin, it probably means that your pancreas has pooped out and cannot
produce enough insulin to control your blood glucose, even when stimulated
by oral drugs. But taking insulin is no more a death sentence for you than it is
for the person with type 1 diabetes.
Some people believe that insulin, itself, causes complications like impotence
or other damage. There is no evidence for this. A recent study that was publi-
cized but not yet published suggested that using insulin to lower the blood
glucose so the hemoglobin A1c was less than 6 percent caused more deaths
than lowering it to a more modest level like 7 percent.
These were patients who had already had a heart attack and were quite sick
when the study began. Even so, the doctors could not get their hemoglobin
A1c to the level they wanted with insulin. The goal was set too low. It does
not take lowering to 6 percent to prevent complications in new patients with
diabetes; 6.5 percent will accomplish this. First of all, using insulin is often a
temporary measure for when you’re very sick with some other illness that
makes your oral drugs ineffective. When the illness is over, your insulin
needs end.
Secondly, you may be on insulin because oral agents you tried failed to con-
trol your glucose. I see many people in this situation who can be taken off the
insulin and given one of the newer oral agents, which actually control their
glucose better than the insulin. One typical patient came to me on 60 units of
insulin weighing 180 pounds with a hemoglobin A1c of 7.4. I gradually low-
ered his insulin as I added rosiglitazone (now I would add pioglitazone
instead; see Chapter 10) to his treatment. He lost 22 pounds, came off insulin
entirely, and now has a hemoglobin A1c of 6.
Thirdly, elderly people with diabetes may need insulin to keep their blood
glucose at a reasonable level but do not need very tight control because their
probable life span is shorter than the time it takes to develop complications.
Their treatment can be kept very simple. The insulin is being used to keep
them out of immediate trouble, not to prevent complications.
Finally, people with type 2 diabetes who truly need to be on insulin intensively
need to check their blood glucose more often and live more like a person with
type 1 diabetes. I hope you realize that with today’s methods, this level of
intensive treatment means a much higher quality of life than it used to.
People with Diabetes Shouldn’t Exercise
If any myth is really damaging to people with diabetes, it is this one: People
with diabetes shouldn’t exercise. The truth is exactly the opposite. Exercise
is a major component of good diabetes management — one that, unfortu-
nately, all too often gets the least time and effort on the part of the patient as
well as his or her care providers.
308
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Sure, if you have certain complications, like hemorrhaging in your eye or
severe neuropathy, you need to take precautions or not exercise at all for a
time. Certainly, if you’re older than 40 and have not exercised, you need to
have an examination and start gradually. But except for these and a few other
reasons (see Chapter 9), exercise ought to be done regularly by every person
with diabetes.
And I’m not just talking about aerobic exercise where your heart is beating
faster. Some form of muscle strengthening needs to be a part of your lifestyle.
(See Chapter 9 to find out the benefits of muscle strengthening.) If you have a
muscle that you can move, move it!
You Can’t Get Life and Health Insurance
I devote Chapter 15 to showing you that you can get life and health insur-
ance. As the insurance industry recognizes that people with diabetes take
better care of themselves than the general population does, it is more and
more willing to insure them. Some unenlightened insurance companies 
still exist, but most are seeing the light as the vital statistics of the diabetic
population improve.
The old problem of a preexisting condition seems to be disappearing as well.
Insurance companies are not being allowed to use this excuse to block you
from getting new insurance when you change jobs.
One thing that is true is that the cost of medical care is significant and is not
declining. You don’t want to be without medical insurance for any length of
time. You may have to look a little longer than the person without diabetes,
but you can eventually get insurance, and the price will be no higher than
anyone else is paying.
Most Diabetes Is Inherited
Although type 2 diabetes runs in families, type 1 diabetes more often occurs
as an isolated event in a family rather than being handed down from parent
to child. (Chapter 3 explains why this is the case.) Even type 2 diabetes does
not come out in every family member. It depends on factors such as body
weight and level of activity.
Parents should not feel guilty if their small child develops diabetes. Such 
feelings make it harder to perform the necessary functions that parents must
do to help their child be healthy.
309
Chapter 19: Ten Myths about Diabetes That You Can Forget

Diabetes Wrecks Your Sense of Humor
After the initial stages of accepting diabetes, your sense of humor should
return. (See Chapter 1 for more on dealing with diabetes.) If your humor
doesn’t return, it’s no laughing matter.
Dr. Joel Goodman, director of The HUMOR Project, pointed out in a lecture 
I attended that you “jest for the health of it.” Numerous scientific studies
have shown the health benefits of laughter.
The comedian Steve Allen pointed out in an interview performed by Dr.
Goodman that there is humor in every aspect of life — you just have to look
for it. The saying goes “Someday we’ll laugh about this.” The question is
“Why wait?”
My diabetic patients have been the source of many funny stories, some 
of which I tell in this book. I want to give you the assignment of coming up
with at least one funny story from your diabetic past. Send me an e-mail at
drrubin@drrubin.com or write me a note about it. Remember that what
you think is funny may not be funny to someone else. This is clearly shown
by our individual preferences in comedians. Ask ten of your friends who 
their favorite comedian is and see if you don’t come back with 12 answers.
Soak Your Feet Daily 
if You Have Diabetes
Here’s an eleventh myth since you just gave me a standing ovation for writing
this book. A standing ovation deserves a brief encore.
This myth causes more damage than it prevents. Soaking the feet tends to
dry them. The skin can crack and infection can occur. This is, of course, the
opposite of what you are trying to accomplish. Protect your skin by using a
moisturizing lotion on a regular basis.
Make sure you inspect your feet every day, particularly if there is any ques-
tion about your ability to feel abnormalities in your feet. Washing your feet
with a good soap containing a moisturizing lotion is a good time to do that
inspection.
Follow that up by applying a thick, not a thin watery moisturizing lotion to
your feet. They will continue to give you good service for many years to come.

D
iabetes is a social disease. No, I don’t mean that you catch it like herpes.
I mean that you can’t continue very long with diabetes without calling
on the help and expertise of others. Asking for help is not such a bad thing.
People who regularly interact with others seem to live longer and have a
higher quality of life.
Diabetes has become so pervasive in the United States that practically 
everyone knows someone who has diabetes or has it himself. There is a huge,
growing body of knowledge about all aspects of diabetes, but you have to be
willing to share your diagnosis with others so they can help you. These days 
I even get new patients when people who know they have diabetes share
their diagnosis and symptoms with someone else and that person realizes
that he has diabetes as well.
In this chapter, you discover how to make use of the great resources that 
are available to people with diabetes. So many knowledgeable people are out
there — it would be a shame not to utilize their information. (Why, even I use
my colleagues’ knowledge on very rare occasions!)
Explain Hypoglycemia
If you take either insulin or one of the sulfonylurea medications (see Chapter
10), you may become hypoglycemic. Occasionally, hypoglycemia can be so

severe that you’re unaware of the problem. At that point, someone in your
environment needs to know the symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to treat
it. Chapter 4 contains all that information.
You may want to make a list of the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and
pass it around to your family and friends. You should keep that list and an
emergency kit to treat hypoglycemia at home and at work. You may even
want to wear a medical alert bracelet so someone can identify your problem
when none of these people are around.
Follow the Standards of 
Care with Your Doctor
Decades of following diabetes patients, along with increasing scientific 
knowledge, has led to the establishment of “standards of care” for the person
with diabetes. These recommendations usually appear in a supplement 
to the January issue of Diabetes Care, a journal of the American Diabetes
Association. I outline these standards in Chapter 7 and on the Cheat Sheet 
at the front of this book. By following the standards of care, you have a 
good chance of avoiding the short- and long-term complications of diabetes.
If these complications have already occurred, you have a good chance of
having them diagnosed while they are still treatable.
You are the one who needs to make sure that you get an annual eye examina-
tion, get your urine tested for microalbumin and your nerves tested for sen-
sation, and get all the other tests that must be done regularly and routinely.
(See Chapter 7 for more on these tests.) You can’t do these tests alone, how-
ever. You need your physician to order the tests and send you to the eye
doctor. Don’t expect your physician to remember all these details. Just as
you have trouble keeping to a program of care over a lifetime, your physician
does much better with acute illnesses than chronic ones.
Find an Exercise Partner
Few people (and I certainly count myself among this group) continue a 
regular exercise program completely on their own. However, when you know
that someone is waiting for you, you tend to perform the exercise much 
more regularly. I have many patients who are regular exercisers because I
emphasize exercise so much. All of them exercise with a partner.
If you belong to a club, finding an exercise partner is easy. First, you select
the sport, and then you hang out in the place where the sport is played. If the
sport is a racket sport, you will soon find others at about your level. If the

sport is something like running, you have to be a little forward and ask
whether you can join someone or a group about to run. The people you can
keep up with are your natural exercise partners.
If you’re not a member of a club, finding an exercise partner is a little more
difficult. You may have to approach people with whom you work, or you may
need your significant other to commit to exercising with you. Most people 
are happy to walk with you, and some will run and bike with you. Cyclists
seem to like group activity, and you can usually find a bike group to ride 
with. Check out listings at a local bike shop or the Sunday newspaper in the
activities section.
Use Your Foot Doctor
Your foot doctor is your first line of defense against lesions of the foot. He or
she knows what the foot should look like and will notice problems very early
when they’re still reversible. Your doctor will usually have a foot doctor that
he likes to work with.
One of the most useful things the foot doctor can do is to cut your nails. It is
too easy to accidentally cut your skin when you try to cut your own nails. If
you have diabetes, the consequences can be serious.
Should you notice an abnormality, you must get to the foot doctor immedi-
ately. This is a situation where you are much better off erring on the side of
too much rather than too little medical care. In my practice, I ask the patients
about their feet at every visit and examine the feet of those who have been
found to have neuropathy (see Chapter 5) in the past. If I discover a foot
problem, the foot doctor sees it that day.
Doctors recently performed the first hand transplantation, which seems to be
going well, but as far as I know, no plans exist to do a foot transplantation.
Take good care of your feet because they have to last a lifetime. Your foot
doctor can be your major ally in this endeavor.
Enlist Help to Fight Food Temptation
Ever since Adam and Eve, the problem of temptation has been on the front
burner. For a diabetic, the constant temptation is to eat foods that do not fur-
ther your major diabetic goal, which is to control your blood glucose. The
opportunities for screwing up your diet are boundless. Just like your exercise
partner, your “food partner” — your significant other — can make staying on
your diet a lot easier for you.
313
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Get Others to Help You

If your partner cooks most of the meals in your household, he or she has a
responsibility to prepare the right kinds of foods. To do this, your partner
must know what to make and what to avoid (see Chapter 8). If you go to the
dietitian, take your partner along.
Numerous books of recipes and meals are written specifically for the person
with diabetes. The first cookbook you should look at is Diabetes Cookbook
For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley), which I wrote with Alison Acerra. That
book would not have been written if it didn’t offer a special feature — the
recipes of some of the finest chefs in the United States and Canada. You can
also go on the Internet to find good recipes; see Appendix C for a list of great
Web sites to check out. 
I believe that the big problem in diabetes (as well as the nondiabetic obese
population) is large portions of food. One of the simplest of diets is to eat the
same foods but half as much. As I worked with the chefs in the various
restaurants represented in Appendix A, again and again they remarked to me
that Americans eat much more food in a portion than Europeans. Americans
have learned to avoid fat, but they eat too much carbohydrate. 
When it comes to eating out, your loved one can steer you to restaurants
where you can choose foods that work for you. When you’re in the restau-
rant, he or she can point out the healthy choices. The best way to direct you
is to set an example of appropriate eating for you. 
If you’re asked to dinner in someone’s home, your loved one can help by
telling your host or hostess in advance that you have diabetes and need to
avoid eating certain foods. It is unwise, however, to turn your loved one into
a nag. Don’t ask that you be reminded each time you stray from your diet.
That will lead to hostility.
Expand Your Education with 
Diabetes Educators
The person who serves as your diabetes educator is the source of a huge
amount of necessary and sometimes critical information. Every person with
diabetes ought to go through a program of education after the initial shock 
of the diagnosis is past (see Chapter 1). Never hesitate to ask a question, no
matter how basic you think it may be. You will be surprised by how many
others want the same information. 
Of course, every caregiver should be a diabetes educator as well. When 
you are past the formal diabetes education program, don’t hesitate to ask
questions of your physician, your dietitian, or any of the other people in 
your team (see Chapter 11).
314
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Knowledge about diabetes is expanding so fast that great advances are arriv-
ing almost daily. Some of these advances may be just what you need.
Fit Your Favorite Foods into 
Your Diet with a Dietitian
Years ago when you got diabetes, it meant you had to make enormous
changes in your diet. This was hard enough for people who ate the usual
American diet, but much harder for people who came from another culture
and had an entirely different diet. This situation has changed dramatically.
The dietitian’s job is to come up with a diabetic diet plan based upon your
food choices, not those of the dietitian. If you have special dietary needs
because of your culture, a dietitian must be able to accommodate those
needs if they are reasonable.
Members of your culture ate the foods that you like for generations without
developing diabetes in large numbers. The main reasons they didn’t develop
diabetes in large numbers are that they did not eat the large portions you eat
and they were much more physically active than you are. If you want to keep
enjoying “your” foods, eat and exercise like your great-grandparents.
Do not be satisfied with a printed sheet of paper with the heading “Diabetic
Diet.” The key word in diabetic diets is individualization. You probably won’t
stay on a diet that you do not enjoy.
Seek Out Appropriate Specialists
The specialist who knows the most about diabetes is the diabetologist, a
physician with advanced training in diabetes care who maintains his or her
edge by attending diabetes meetings regularly and keeping up with the litera-
ture by reading the most important clinical diabetes journals. In addition,
these days an up-to-date specialist has to be aware of what is on the Internet
and how to differentiate reality from hype. This person can explain the latest
advances in diabetes to you.
Not only do you want to find a diabetes specialist, but should you develop a
complication of diabetes, you want to use a specialist in that area. At the first
sign of kidney disease associated with diabetes, ask your doctor to refer you
to a nephrologist. You should already be examined by an eye doctor on an
annual basis. If there is any question of loss of sensation or abnormal muscle
movements, see a neurologist. If there is any indication of heart trouble, get a
referral to a cardiologist.
315
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Get Others to Help You

The pace of advances in diabetes is amazing. A general physician cannot
keep up with it. The diabetes specialist concentrates on diabetes and the
other specialists concentrate on their fields, and that is to your benefit.
Discuss Your Medications 
with the Pharmacist
One of your most valuable and least utilized resources is your pharmacist. 
He or she is loaded with information about drug actions, interactions, side
effects, proper dosage and administration, and contraindications, as well as
what to do in case of an overdosage. Every time you get a new medication,
you can have your pharmacist run it against the medications you’re already
taking and see whether any problems might occur. Thanks to computers, this
comparison should take only a few minutes. If you work with one drug store,
you should be able to get a printout of your entire list of medications, which
you can carry with you in case you ever need medical care.
The pharmacist can also save you money by recommending generic equiva-
lents to the brands that your doctor prescribes. The doctor may have good
reason to prescribe them so the pharmacist will check with him before giving
you a different medication.
The information in the computer tends to be all-inclusive. If a drug has ever
had a side effect, no matter how rare, it will probably be in the computer. The
drug manufacturer wants to be able to say that it warned you about every
possibility. If a side effect or drug interaction is serious, discuss it with your
physician before you start the new medication.
Share This Book with Everyone
If you really want your friends and loved ones to understand what you’re
going through, why not give them a copy of this book and ask them to read
it? You can select the chapters that are most important to you. Your family
and friends will probably be delighted to have a resource they can under-
stand, and you can expect a lot more help from them.
When I began writing this book, I did so because I saw a need for information
that could be understood by most people without the benefit of a medical
school education. At the same time, I wanted you to have a little fun because
“a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.” But I did not want to trivi-
alize diabetes and hope I have not done so. If you believe I have succeeded in
what I set out to do, share this book with others.

and satisfying recipes that you can make, proof that you
can have diabetes and eat delicious food. If you don’t feel
like making them, you find the name of the restaurant 
that has provided the recipe in case you live near the
restaurant.
Appendix B presents an introduction to the magnificent
World Wide Web and the almost limitless resources about
diabetes to be found there. You will be amazed at how
much is given away for free on the Web. Just make sure
the source is reliable. Appendix C is a glossary of terms
you encounter as you read and hear about diabetes. In
this glossary you should be able to find any diabetes-
related term that you do not understand.

his appendix should make it clear to you that you can have great food
from every ethnic corner of the world and still stay within the require-
ments of a diabetic diet. In a short appendix like this, I could not include
every possible type of food, but I tried to select foods that most people enjoy
either at home or in a restaurant. I chose the restaurants from among the
best in the country, with an emphasis on San Francisco because that is where
I reside and (happily) get to try them. If you want even more variety, see my
book Diabetes Cookbook For Dummies (Wiley).
Sometimes it was necessary to alter a recipe slightly to keep it appropriate
for a diabetic diet, but this was never done without the approval of the chef
who created it. These chefs and restaurants were a pleasure to work with and
deserve great praise for their willingness to accommodate the needs of the
diabetic patient.
Some recipes may take a little longer to prepare, but all are worth the time
and the effort. In any case, you can go to the restaurant that provided the
recipe, order that meal, and know that you are on your diabetic diet.
Keep in mind that all temperatures are in Fahrenheit.

Part VI: Appendixes 
Warm Asparagus and Morel Salad
This dish is perfect as the first or second course to any meal. 
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
48 asparagus spears
1 cup balsamic vinegar
8 ounces morel mushrooms
1 tablespoon butter, plus 1 teaspoon to warm
asparagus
Salt and pepper to taste
2 heads frisee
1 to 2 tablespoons water
1⁄4 cup olive oil
1 Peel each piece of asparagus 2 inches from the top to the base (you won’t need to do
this if you’re using young, thin asparagus). Cut each spear, leaving a 3- to 4-inch tip. Use
remaining asparagus by slicing 1⁄4-inch rounds. Do not use woody part of asparagus.
Keep tips and rounds separate.
2 Boil water, adding salt to taste. Add asparagus tips to boiling water. Once tender but
still firm, about 2 minutes, place the asparagus in ice cold water to cool. Proceed by
blanching asparagus rounds another 2 to 3 minutes. Use same process to cool. Set the
cooling tips and rounds aside, keeping them separate.
3 Over low heat, in a heavy-bottom saucepan, cook the vinegar for 20 to 30 minutes,
never allowing it to reach a boil. Once the balsamic reaches a syrupy consistency,
remove from heat. This process requires attention. It is quite easy to burn the balsamic.
4 Slice the morel mushrooms into 1⁄4-inch rounds and place in warm water to remove
excess dirt. Dry mushrooms to get rid of the moisture. In a medium sauté pan, heat the
butter over medium heat. When bubbly, add the mushrooms. Cook, occasionally stirring
gently, until soft, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
5 Remove all outside leaves from the frisee, leaving only the inner white leaves. Separate
the leaves from the stem, rinse under cold water, and spin or pat dry. Set aside.
6 To serve: Drizzle the balsamic glaze decoratively on each plate. In a medium sauté pan,
warm the asparagus tips in the remaining butter mixed with 1 to 2 tablespoons water.
Place the asparagus tips facing outward toward the rim of the plate. In the same sauté
pan, heat the asparagus rounds with the morel slices. Then place the morels and
asparagus rounds in a neat mound slightly overlapping the ends of the asparagus tips.

Marinated Grilled Duck Breast
Although duck is higher in fat than other types of poultry, it still can be served as a dish
for special occasions. Round out this meal with a cup of wild rice and sautéed vegetables.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1⁄2 cup Worcestershire sauce
1⁄4 cup honey
1 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1⁄2 tablespoon lemon juice
1⁄2 bunch Italian parsley
1⁄2 bunch rosemary
1⁄2 bunch chives 
4 duck breasts
Salt and pepper to taste
1 For marinade: Place all ingredients, except for duck, in a large bowl and mix well. Score
(make crisscross patterns with the tip of a sharp knife) skin side of the cleaned duck
breast. Place the duck into the bowl, coat it with marinade, and cover the bowl.
Refrigerate and marinate for 24 hours.
2 Preheat grill. Remove duck from marinade and pat dry with a clean towel. Season with
salt and pepper. Grill for 10 minutes on skin side; turn, moving the breasts to cooler por-
tions of the grill, and cook another 5 minutes, or until medium rare. (To sear duck
rather than grilling, place 2 nonstick skillets over medium-high heat. When hot, add the
duck breasts, skin side down. Cook for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat, turn breasts over,
and cook another 5 minutes or until medium rare.) Slice just before serving.

2 pounds red and yellow cherry tomatoes
3 tablespoons olive oil
8 swordfish, approximately 6 ounces each
Salt and pepper to taste
1 pound arugula
1 For vinaigrette: Mix all ingredients together. This vinaigrette should be made 24 hours in
advance. The nutritional analysis reflects only 2 tablespoons.
2 For roasted vegetables: Heat oven to 375°. Place iron skillet in oven until hot. Keeping
vegetables separate, in a large bowl, toss the potatoes, beets, carrots, mushrooms, shal-
lots, tomatoes, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt and pepper, then transfer to hot skillet.
Roast vegetables until tender, about 45 minutes. You can do this ahead of time and then
reheat the vegetables when you’re ready to cook the fish.
3 To serve: Reheat the vegetables in the oven if they’re done ahead of time. Preheat the grill.
Season the swordfish on both sides and cook until medium rare, about 3 minutes per side.
4 In a large sauté pan, heat the remaining olive oil over high heat. Add the arugula and
cook, tossing or gently mixing with kitchen tongs, just until the greens start to wilt,
about 1 minute. Mix greens with the hot vegetables and place in the center of the plate,
dividing vegetables evenly.
5 Place swordfish on top of vegetables. Drizzle 2 tablespoons vinaigrette over each portion.

5 assorted radishes, thinly sliced
1 cup shiitake mushrooms, sliced
1 8-ounce package enoki mushrooms
1 For marinade: In a large bowl, mix together the sugars, miso paste, soy sauce, sake, and
rice wine vinegar. Place the fish into the bowl, coat it with marinade, and cover the
bowl. Refrigerate and marinate for 24 hours.
2 Preheat the broiler. Rub a shallow roasting pan (large enough to fit the fish in 1 layer)
lightly with vegetable oil. Remove the sea bass fillets from the marinade, place them on
the roasting pan, and place under the broiler. Cook until the fish begins to brown, about
2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook through, about 5 minutes,
depending on the thickness of the fillets.
3 Combine the consommé with snow peas, carrots, bok choy, radishes, and shiitake and
enoki mushrooms in a medium sauté pan. Simmer, covered, until vegetables are warm.
Season to taste. Place a pile of vegetables in the center of each large serving bowl, set a
sea bass fillet on top, and spoon the consommé around.

Fringale
Fringale has been called the perfect French bistro. The owners, Gerald
Hirigoyen and J. B. Lorda, consider it a California/Basque bistro. By whatever
designation, the food is straightforward and flavorful, and the social atmos-
phere is full of character and energy. The high quality of the food is in contrast
to the moderate prices of everything on the menu. Much of the menu can be
enjoyed not only for taste but also for the healthful qualities of the food.
Partner Gerald Hirigoyen is also the chef. He trained in the Basque region of
France and in Paris with some of the great names in French cuisine. He came
to San Francisco in 1980 and ran the kitchens of several fine restaurants, but
in 1991, he decided to go out on his own and start this restaurant. He has
received numerous awards and much recognition for the quality of his food.
Food and Wine called him one of 1994’s “Best New Chefs in America.”

with Braising Greens, Parsnips, 
and Cippolini Onions
This dish allows room for two additional servings of starches. You may want to include
a couple servings of bread to soak up this wonderful sauce!
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour, 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 chicken thighs, without skin
4 chicken breasts, split, without skin
2 cups red wine
1 small onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
6 sprigs thyme
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup veal stock
8 cippolini onions, peeled
8 baby carrots, peeled
2 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into large
matchsticks
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 pounds braising greens, such as green
chard, with stems removed and leaves torn
into large pieces
2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley

1 In a large bowl, combine the chicken thighs, breasts, red wine, onion, garlic, thyme,
black peppercorns, and salt and pepper to season. Cover with plastic wrap and refriger-
ate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.
2 Preheat oven to 450°. Separate the chicken from the marinade and set both aside.
3 Warm 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large casserole. Add the 4 chicken thighs and sauté
until browned, about 5 minutes. Pour the marinade into the casserole with the thighs,
add the veal stock, and bring to a boil. Once it boils, reduce heat and let the ingredients
simmer for 25 to 30 minutes.
4 Warm 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large sauté pan over high heat. Add breasts and sauté
until browned, about 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and place in
the oven until cooked, about 10 minutes.
5 Place the cippolini onions in a small pan with enough water to cover, bring to a boil,
and cook until soft and tender, about 20 minutes. Strain and set aside. Fill a saucepan
two-thirds full of water, bring to a boil, add baby carrots, and cook until tender, about 6
to 8 minutes. Strain and set aside. Place parsnips in a saucepan with enough water to
cover, bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Strain and set
aside.
6 When the chicken thighs are done, separate them from the marinade and set aside.
Using a fine meshed sieve, strain the marinade into a small saucepan and discard the
vegetables.
7 Bring the marinade to a boil and reduce by half. Turn off the heat, swirl in 1 tablespoon
butter in a steady motion until completely incorporated, and season with salt and
pepper to taste.
8 To prepare braising greens, combine 1⁄3 cup water, 1 tablespoon butter, the braising
greens, and salt and pepper to taste in a large saucepan. Cover and cook over high heat
just until wilted, about 5 minutes.
9 In a separate sauté pan, warm 1 tablespoon butter and then add the onion mixture and
salt and pepper to taste and sauté until nicely caramelized, about 6 minutes. Add the
parsley and set aside.
10 To assemble the dish, using a slotted spoon, place a small bed of the braising greens in
the center of each plate. Lay one chicken thigh and one breast on top of the greens.
Evenly scatter the cippolini onions, carrots, and parsnips on top of the chicken and
spoon the sauce on top of and around the edges of the dish.

Onion Pie with Roquefort 
and Walnuts
This dish is a feast for the eyes as well as the tongue. Serve as a main course for lunch.
A fresh fruit salad and French roll are perfect complements to this meal.
Preparation time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
332
Part VI: Appendixes 
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 white onions, very thinly sliced
1⁄4 cup water
3 ounces Roquefort cheese, crumbled into
small pieces
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1⁄2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon melted butter
2 puff pastry sheets (11 x 15-inch sheets),
fresh or thawed frozen
1 egg, lightly beaten
8 slices of prosciutto (about .5 ounce each)
Mixed greens to garnish
1 Place a baking sheet with sides in a freezer.
2 In a sauté pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onions and sauté
until golden brown (about 10 minutes). Add the water and continue to sauté until all 
the moisture evaporates, about 5 minutes longer. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the
Roquefort cheese and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until melted, about 5
more minutes. Season only lightly with salt, if needed, and add pepper to taste. Stir in
the walnuts and then spread the mixture out onto the chilled sheet pan. Place in the
freezer until the onions cool down completely (about 10 minutes).
3 Preheat oven to 450° and evenly brush a sheet pan with melted butter.
4 Place the puff pastry on a cutting board. Using the rim of a small plate about 5 inches in
diameter as a guide, cut the pastry into 8 rounds. Discard scraps.
5 Place the rounds onto the prepared baking sheet. Brush the outer rims and tops with
the beaten egg. Evenly distribute the cooled onion mixture in the middle of each of the
8 rounds, leaving 1 inch uncovered all around the edges. Place 1 prosciutto slice on top
of each mound of the onion mixture. Fold over the pastry round to create a half-moon
shape. Pinch down firmly around the edges to seal in the filling. Brush the top of each
pie with more of the beaten egg. Using a sharp knife, pierce the top of each pie with a
small slit.
6 Bake until the pastry is pale golden and fully puffed, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Greens
When residents of the San Francisco Bay area think of great vegetarian food,
Greens is the first name that comes to mind. Greens uses the freshest ingredi-
ents, many of which come from the Zen Center’s Green Gulch Farm, across
the Golden Gate Bridge in Marin County. This brief trip results in no loss of
freshness for the fine seasonal organic produce.
Chef Annie Somerville came to Greens in 1981 and became Executive Chef 
in 1985. In her 23rd year of cooking at Greens, she continues to create out-
standing dishes with a balance of colors, flavors, and contrast of textures. 
In addition to the Green Gulch and Start Route Farms in Marin County, 
she uses artisan cheeses from West Marin and Sonoma counties. She has

authored the award-winning book Field of Greens: New Vegetarian Recipes
from the Celebrated Greens Restaurant.

Sweet Pepper and Basil Frittata
You can serve this dish right out of the oven as a main course or let it cool and serve as

an hors d’oeuvre.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 10 servings
339
Appendix A: Mini-Cookbook
2 tablespoons light olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced, about 
2 cups
3⁄4 teaspoon salt and pepper
4 medium sweet peppers, preferably a
combination of red and yellow, thinly sliced,
about 4 cups
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 bay leaf
6 eggs
3 ounces Fontina cheese, grated, about 
11⁄2 cups
2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated, about 
3⁄4 cup
1⁄4 cup fresh basil leaves, bundled and thinly
sliced
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 Preheat oven to 475°. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet; add the onion, 1⁄2 tea-
spoon salt, and a few pinches of pepper. Sauté the onion over medium heat until it
begins to soften, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the sweet peppers, garlic, and bay leaf; stew
the onion and peppers together for about 15 minutes, until the peppers are tender. Set
the vegetables aside to cool. Remove the bay leaf.
2 Beat the eggs in a bowl and add the onion–pepper mixture, cheeses, and basil. Season
with 1⁄4 teaspoon salt and 1⁄8 teaspoon pepper.
3 In a 9-inch nonstick sauté pan with an ovenproof handle, heat the remaining tablespoon
of olive oil until almost smoking. Swirl the oil around the side of the pan to coat. Turn
the heat down to low and then immediately pour the frittata mixture into the pan. The
pan should be hot enough so that the eggs sizzle when they touch the oil. Cook the frit-
tata over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until the sides begin to set; transfer to the oven
and bake, uncovered, for 6 to 8 minutes, until firm and the eggs are completely cooked.
4 Loosen the fritatta gently with a rubber spatula; the bottom will tend to stick to the pan.
Place a plate over the pan, flip it over, and put it on a plate. Brush the bottom and sides
with the vinegar and cut into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Rhubarb–Strawberry Cobbler
This wonderful dessert is a snap to make. You can make it with less sugar (1⁄8 cup) if you

Cobbler filling
11⁄4 pounds rhubarb
1 pint basket of strawberries, about 11⁄2 cups
1⁄4 cup sugar
2 1⁄2 tablespoons unbleached white flour
Zest of 1 small orange
Cobbler topping
11⁄2 cups unbleached white flour
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 tablespoons sugar
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup heavy cream
1 Preheat oven to 375°. Wash the rhubarb well, cutting off any brown spots or leaves still
on the stalks. If the stalks are especially thick, cut them in half lengthwise before slicing
1⁄2-inch thick so that all the pieces are approximately the same size.
2 Wash the strawberries, pat dry, and hull them. Cut them into halves or leave whole if
small.
3 Toss the fruit with the sugar, flour, and zest; place in an 8-inch square baking dish, a 9-
inch round cake pan, or 6 to 8 individual ovenproof dishes.
4 Make the cobbler topping by combining the dry ingredients. Cut in the butter with a
food processor, an electric mixer, a pastry blender, or 2 knives until it resembles coarse
meal. Add the cream and mix lightly, just until the dry ingredients are moistened.
5 Cover the fruit with tablespoon-size dollops of cobbler topping, using all the topping.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the topping is browned and cooked through and the
fruit is bubbling. Individual cobblers take about 20 minutes.

Harbor Village
Acclaimed by Gourmet Magazine as a “gold cup restaurant commanding the
respect of Chinese gastronomics,” Harbor Village was serving award-winning
food in Hong Kong for many years before coming to San Francisco and later Los
Angeles. In an environment reminiscent of the fine restaurants of Hong Kong,
the Chinese chefs prepare dim sum that has been called the finest in the United
States. The seafood is prepared fresh from their fish tanks. Dishes are made up
of fresh local ingredients, yet the result is exotic delicacies such as abalone,
shark’s fin, and bird’s nest soup. The service is just as good as the food.
Executive chef Andy Wai runs a kitchen staff of 40 in San Francisco. He
learned his craft in the finest Hong Kong restaurants, finally cooking at
Harbor Village’s parent restaurant in Hong Kong, Tsui Hang Village. From
there, he came to San Francisco in 1989 where he has been the recipient of
numerous awards for his creativity.

Il Fornaio (eel for-NIGH-oh) means “the baker” in Italian. The company began
as a baking school outside Milan, Italy, in 1972, created in response to the 
disappearing art of centuries-old Italian baking. In 1981, Il Fornaio came to
the United States and has since grown to include some of the most successful
restaurants and bakeries in America. Today, you can enjoy Il Fornaio’s authen-

tic Italian food and baked goods at any of 21 locations in California, Portland,

which includes the great cuisine of Bologna. He learned to cook at his Uncle
Salvatore’s knee, going on to culinary school in Cervia, Italy. He apprenticed
in the finest Italian restaurants and was offered a position at Valentino
Restaurant in Los Angeles, where he met his wife. Italy’s loss became San
Francisco’s gain when he took a position as head chef at Il Fornaio.

Scallopine Al Funghi 
(Veal with Mushrooms)
This recipe makes delicious use of veal, but you can substitute chicken breasts for the
veal. Just marinate the chicken with chopped sage and rosemary. Try using different
types of mushrooms, which gives the recipe a different taste: bottom mushrooms, shi-
itake, chanterelle, or porcini. A half cup of any pasta (or, if you prefer, a slice of bread
and a quarter cup of pasta) provides the necessary carbohydrate.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 2- to 3-ounce veal scallops
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon flour
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 chopped garlic clove
1 cup sliced mixed mushrooms
1⁄2 cup white wine
10 leaves Italian parsley
1⁄4 cup vegetable stock
1 Place the veal scallops two at a time between sheets of plastic wrap and pound them
with a meat mallet until 1⁄4 inch thick. Season them with salt and pepper. Cover the veal
scallops with flour, shaking off excess. Heat the butter in a sauté pan. Add the veal and
cook for 2 minutes on each side. Transfer veal to a plate.
2 In the same pan add the oil, garlic, mushrooms, white wine, and parsley. Cook for a few
minutes and add the veal and stock. Simmer for about 5 minutes.
3 Set veal on a plate and top with the mushroom sauce.

Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
12 ounces skinless chicken breasts, diced
Salt and pepper to taste
4 garlic cloves, sliced

Risotto Ai Vegetali (Italian Rice 
with Vegetables)
A serving of this recipe provides all the carbohydrates for a full meal. It contains the
vegetables you need as well. It lacks protein, which you can make up with a few ounces
of chicken or fish. Use whatever vegetable is in season, including zucchini, artichokes,
asparagus, or mushrooms. Be aware of the number of servings you have when you
make this dish. Overeating is easy if you’re not careful!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Yield: 10 servings
3 tablespoons butter
1 large shallot, diced
3 cups seasonal vegetables, diced
2 cups Italian Arborio rice
1⁄2 cup white wine
8 cups vegetable stock
1⁄2 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
1 In a 4- to 6-quart heavy-bottom saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon butter over low-medium
heat. Stir in the shallots and cook slowly for 4 minutes or until onions are soft and clear,
but not brown. Increase the heat to medium, add all the vegetables, and cook, stirring,
for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook, gently stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in
the white wine and cook until it is almost completely reduced. Add the stock, 1 cup at a
time, and cook at a low boil, stirring often, until absorbed. Each cup must be absorbed
before the next is added. After 15 minutes, taste a grain of rice — it should have a slight
resistance to the bite. If it seems too hard, add a little bit more stock and continue cook-
ing for a couple more minutes.
2 When rice is ready, remove from heat. Add remaining butter and Parmesan cheese. Add
salt and pepper to taste and mix with a wooden spoon until creamy in texture.

Bavarese Bianca Con Frutta 
(White Gelatin with Fruit)
This recipe is a dessert treat that should not be eaten too often, but it shows that you
can enjoy such treats in moderation and still follow your diabetic diet. Because the
recipe is mostly carbohydrate and fat, it replaces those energy sources in your meal.
The meal itself should be a few ounces of meat, fish, or poultry with a couple servings
of vegetables.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: None
Yield: 4 servings
1 envelope plain gelatin
11⁄2 cups 1 percent milk
1⁄2 cup cream
1⁄4 cup sugar
1 cup mixed berries
4 mint leaves
1 In a small bowl, mix together the gelatin and milk; let sit 5 minutes, until gelatin is dis-
solved. In a double boiler, bring the milk, cream, and sugar to a boil, stirring continu-
ously to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
2 Line four 3-ounce espresso cups with clear plastic wrap. Pour mixture into cups and
refrigerate overnight or at least 6 hours.
3 Turn over the cups onto a plate. Remove plastic wrap and garnish with berries and mint
leaves.

Dr. W.W. Web
I
n just a few years, the World Wide Web went from containing little or no
information on diabetes to hosting more information than anyone can
digest. This appendix presents the best sites for you to check. You should be
able to get answers online to just about any questions that you have, but you
must be cautious about the source of the advice. Do not make any major
changes in your diabetes care without checking with your physician.
As I note in Chapter 19, to determine whether information you find on a Web
site is really useful, you need to discuss it with your physician, your diabetes
educator, or other members of your team (see Chapter 11). Any Web site I
discuss in this appendix can be relied upon, but sometimes free advice is
worth no more than you pay for it. Remember that the Web is constantly chang-
ing and growing, so these addresses are valid at least on the day I list them.
My Web Site
