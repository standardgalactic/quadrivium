Azure OpenAI Service
•
Provides REST API access to OpenAI language models
•
The only cloud offering OpenAI models
•
Improved reliability
•
Security controls
•
Great SLA – 99.9%

Azure OpenAI Models
•
The following model families are available in Azure OpenAI service:
GPT-3 (incl. ChatGPT)
GPT-4
Codex
Embedding

Azure OpenAI Models
•
Each model family has its own set of capabilities
•
When calling the Azure OpenAI REST API we need to specify the 
exact model we want to use in the model family
•
Using the following format:
{capability}-{family}-{version}

GPT-3
•
A family of models that can understand and generate natural 
language
•
Each model in GPT-3 has its own tradeoff between capability and 
performance
•
Models are named in alphabetical order. Goes from the fastest to 
the most capable

GPT-3
•
GPT-3 models:
text-ada-001
text-babbage-001
text-curie-001
text-davinci-003
gpt-35-turbo
The fastest model. Good for parsing text 
and basic classification tasks
Can be used for semantic search and 
simple classification
Can be used for translation, complex classification, 
text sentiment, summarization
The most capable model. Use for identifying complex 
intent and summarization
ChatGPT. Conversational model capable of complex 
interactions in a conversation-in / message-out 
format. Has its own API

GPT-4
•
Improve over GPT-3
•
Capable of solving difficult problems
•
Better accuracy than GPT-3
•
Optimized for chats
•
Currently in preview, not publicly available

GPT-4
•
In order to get access:
•
Have OpenAI service access
•
Apply to join the waiting list
•
Link is in the resources of this lecture
•
We won’t use it in this course

GPT-4
•
GPT-4 models:
gpt-4
gpt-4-32k
Supports up to 8,192 input tokens
Supports up to 32,768 input tokens

Codex
•
Based on GPT-3
•
Specializes in understanding and generating code
•
Trained on billions of lines of public code from GitHub 

Codex
•
Works best in Python
•
Supports also:
C#
JavaScript
Go
Perl
PHP
Ruby
Swift
TypeScript
SQL
Shell

Codex
•
Codex models:
code-Cushman-001
code-davinci-002
Fast, good for simple tasks
The most capable model, can perform any 
code-related task. Great understanding of 
code segments

Embeddings
•
A special format of data representation
•
Used by machine learning models and algorithms
•
We won’t work with embeddings in this course

Use Cases
Why?
(would we want to use Azure OpenAI service and not just ChatGPT?)

OpenAI in Azure
Reliability
Azure OpenAI service commits to 99.9% SLA
Security
OpenAI service can be protected using advanced 
security controls
Access is allowed only to authorized users in 
authorized networks
Usability
Azure OpenAI Studio offers a visual, easy to use 
tool for testing and customizing AI models

Use Case #1
Customer Service ChatBot
•
Expose a ChatBot to the organization’s customers
•
Uses Azure OpenAI REST API behind the scenes
•
Might utilize custom AI model

Use Case #2
Sensitive Data
•
Use ChatGPT capabilities on sensitive data
•
Don’t want the data to be entered in the public website
•
Make sure access is restricted using network security

Use Case #3
Business Critical Tasks
•
OpenAI API is used for business critical tasks
•
ie. Translate incoming texts from clients
•
Cannot depend on the public website SLA (there isn’t one…)
•
Utilize Azure OpenAI API with its great SLA

Use Case #4
Proprietary Data Model
•
Expose chat interface utilizing proprietary data model
•
Use Azure OpenAI service to deploy custom data model
•
Consume it using the regular OpenAI API

Use Cases
•
These are just a few examples
•
There are endless possibilities when combining the power of Azure 
with the AI capabilities of OpenAI
•
You’ll find your own scenario… 

Responsible AI
•
AI engines can be easily abused
•
Creating offending content
•
Sexual, violent, racist etc.
•
Microsoft takes this very seriously

Responsible AI Initiative
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai

Responsible AI Initiative
•
A set of principles, guidelines and filters targeting potential misuse 
of AI models
•
Make sure to follow these guidelines
•
In short:
Be nice

Responsible AI Initiative
•
Note that every request to OpenAI service goes through the 
Responsible AI filter
•
If it detects a problem – response might be blocked
•
If problem continues – you might be kicked out of the service
Be nice
